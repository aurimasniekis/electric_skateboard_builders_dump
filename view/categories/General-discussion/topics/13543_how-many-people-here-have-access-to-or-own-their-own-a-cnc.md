So I bring this up because I'm helping out with a one piece CNC pulley for the Kegel and Flywheel for a group buy and I was considering making another series for these as well, for those who would like to CNC their own pulley's out of aluminium/stainless steel, nylon, exotic hardwood or whatever material.

Could also make it so the portion that gets inserted is it's own component and the pulley portion is inter changeable. I wouldnt get a chance to do this until after the semester and exams are over, Dec 16th and onward, but if it's something people could actually use and do themselves or send off the files for CNCing then I'm down to create the series for the kegel, flywheel cores and the 107s.

If I had the access I was thinking of a aluminium inner core for what ever wheel and then abs or pla plastic adaptor for the belt which should just bolt to the inner core but I only have a 3D printer no cnc. Would allow nice sturdy bolt hold on the wheels and then a softer wearing pulley and cheaper than a new aluminium pulley all the time.

i have an x-carve, but i've only used it on wood so far. I keep meaning to tweak it for aluminum, i have the info to do it i just haven't yet.

I cut denser steel with my x-carve a month back with great results.

I used this bit:
https://www.inventables.com/technologies/solid-carbide-2-flute-spiral-upcut--3

With a **feed rate** of 500 mm/min, **plunge rate** of 228.6 mm/min, and **Depth Per Pass** of 0.1 mm

I was able to cut a tool I need to press the small bearing off of @hummies motors. it was a 10mm thick piece of steel.

So a few people have them, I didn't think they be common to begin with but okay.  How would you rate the X carve overall?  I have liked it for a while but I just don't know how if it's actually very practical in many applications. I do like to woodwork once in a while though so I was thinking later on in a few years possibly getting one.

Im fairly happy with my xcarve. I used it for wood, plastic and alum. I have it modded quite a bit with stiff mods, aluminium t slot bed, etc.
Now, if you're really going to be cutting a ton of metal you might be better off with a small cnc mill like the one @chaka bought.

Close, but of course a bit pricier. But the difference is HUGE, comparing a vertical mill to a gantry style router is like comparing a bicycle to a 4x4 lol

I've seen a small mill for about $1000 and then figure $200-400 to mod into a cnc with steppers + ramps its pretty comparable to an xcarve price but with real precision/speed...
i think this is something like what ollin is using...
https://littlemachineshop.com/products/product_category.php?category=1387807683

I also started another redesign of the flywheel pulley because I was thinking of looking into forged aluminum. it would cheaper to mass produce and stronger than cnc'd..

We've got a 3-axis CNC VMC. Plus a knee mill, lathe, 3D printer, laser cutter, etc..

I made one-piece aluminum pulleys for genuine Abec 11 wheels. Kegels would have been even easier

I own a xcarve and use with aluminum but mostly 2.5D parts like motor mounts. @JuniorPotato93 give it a try at developing your idea and I think some of us can come with a way to build it :slight_smile:

Overall, I'm quite happy with my x-carve. I thought I was going to use it more than I do now, as my methods of creating boards have changed quite a bit. But it can still be useful at times. Now I just need a 3d printer... With a cnc and 3d printer, the world is your limit :)

Haha that sounds awesome. Soon enough I will get my hands on a 3D printer.

But I don't regret buying the x-carve in the least. It is accurate enough to do almost anything I need from it. There's just some things that are better 3D printed instead of carved.

Mostly do fiberglass plates but starting to mess with aluminum. 200W is really marginal for metal.

BTW, I'm currently upgrading the stock brushed motor to a hobby grade 1200W inrunner brushless motor.

Just an FYI the OpenBuilds parts store is having a Black Friday sale on their CBeam machines (kit). 20% off and it is on sale to start with. About $400 for the mechanical kit, pretty good price for a solid machine, I'll be picking on up (most likely).

The Cbeam is a pretty cool little machine! I like the fixed gantry style with only 1 linear actuator under the bed. Not the most space efficient, but pretty rigid.

[/quote]

That is significantly more involved (read: costly) that making something simple like a motor mount.  You'd have to charge hundreds of dollars for a one-off like that.  Plus, the Caliber shape would be difficult to mill and really has no benefit over a simpler geometry (other than the fact you may already have a mount for it. )

So in conclusion... I have a CNC, but you can count me out :smile:

I second this, you "need" a 5 Axis Vmc to machine something like this which i doubt anyone will take out of commission for a few hours to machine a pair of trucks. Also, you need the truck blanks with the stainless hanger core, im not sure where you can even get that.

The easiest option would be to design around existing skateboard axles. Many CNC trucks use stainless steel or titanium screw-in axles.  Aera, Surf-Rodz, PNL, Fyre, just to name a few

Good news is you can buy the axles separately:

Could you share speed settings, bits, and cooling (if any) that you use to cut aluminum. I have an X-Carve as well, mostly use it to cut drone frames I design. I tried to cut aluminum, but my bit keeps getting clogged and the end result is terrible. Thank you!

Use 2 flute upcut spiral carbide end mills. The rule of thumb with the x-carve and aluminium is go fast and shallow. I use between 0.1mm and 0.25mm depth of cut and between 1500mm/m and 2500mm/m.
You can use coolant if you want, but i find i get chips sticking to the workpiece a lot more with mist coolant.

If you go deep and slow, you're just rubbing your endmill against the workpiece, this creates heat, work hardens the aluminium and gums up the cutter. Idealy you want to keep your cutter engaged to its optimal chipload, but lower the depth so that the x-carve doesn't get overpowered.

As @chinzw said speed is the trick and get good end mill I get them form here  https://www.mcmaster.com/#end-mills/=159r9ub

Try to have your machine be as square as posible and stiffening the X and Y axis helps a lot. Fo not use any cooland get a dust boot and a shopvac to remove the chips.

I run my own CNC machine shop. I have one large vertical mill and I recently purchased a 5 axis mill. I've had a lot of interest in electric skateboards (don't own one yet) but this year is the year I will either buy one or make one. I'd love to help out the community anyway I can. I've always thought about making my own truck on the 5 axis as a single piece.

got a [stepcraft cnc router](https://www.stepcraft-systems.com/en/cnc-3d-systems/stepcraft-2-840). it has a large bed, but as all routers its best for softer materials like wood or plastic. metal is possible but slow:

X-CARVE, modified with a 3' x 5' cutting area, slightly raised height, and the wasteboard is filled with deliberately placed threaded inserts fro bolting various decks down. 

ITs using the DeWalt 611 at the moment but i just ordered the quiet spindle for it. I'm probably going to move over to Acorn this year, i'm getting kind of tired of operating in 2.5D when i have a 3D CNC. ITs time to make press molds. Maybe this is the year. I know @treenutter has a nasty ass custom CNC he's still working on, way more on point than my ratty x-carve. 

my next expensive computerized machine will be a desktop CNC for milling aluminum parts so i can prototype things and actually use them for a while before taking them to a machine shop. Sometime after i find the time to get really good at F360
