Figured with all the picture threads going on it would be fun to have one specifically for soldering and electrical glory, basically our little version of [r/cableporn](https://www.reddit.com/r/cableporn)

Only problem is I dont have an esk8 yet... So ill just show off some of my broken USB flash drive recoveries :smile:  (yes they were all successful)

My Grandson's toy. Someone pulled the snowman off and broke it. So I took it apart and re-soldered the red wire to the tip of the motor shaft. All the lights work now.

I designed built and soldered this circuit board when I was a trainee **15 years ago**. 
obviuosly my skills have improved a lot since then, so this is the minimum standard I expect from everyone on this forum.

DIY Electronic Fuel Injection Project. All components hand soldered to build the ECU and the simulator to test it from scratch.  I can't find any pics of the underside. I did HRHS (high reliability hand soldering) in the Army years ago, so if anyone wants some tips, just ask. It's all in my car now, works pretty sweet.
