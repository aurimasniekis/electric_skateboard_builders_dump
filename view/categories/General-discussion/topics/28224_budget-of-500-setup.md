should i go with a dual 6355 esc setup or a single 6374 VESC setup? Battery is 10s3p. I have a budget of $500 excluding the deck, battery, enclosure, BMS, wheels, and trucks.

If you're just trying to keep the costs down, go with the single 6374 option.

Exactly.  

I think you should just get very nice components for a single and not skimp.  Make sure they can be made into a dual set up later, but just make it single for now.

No one should in fact buy from you, the only reason you are in fact here is to sell your Chinese crap, I went through your activity log and you have contributed nothing to this community. @Michaelinvegas @lox897 can someone please handle this guy because he literally only joined to sell things
