Nope! I shipped parts to South Africa last month. Someone else is riding an E-board in your neighborhood :sunglasses:

Was it hard riding with your trucks mounted backwards? LOL

Hopefully they post up too! Welcome to the forum

Hey dude! Nice build, but sadly not the first on the continent ;)
I live in South Africa and built mine last year, and I know of one or two others in Cape Town that have done similar.
Totally agree about the super-expensive shipping costs!

well it's made of plywood wrapped with vinyl, i tried heat forming ABS but it didnt work out well for my first try and it was too small to fit the battery so i made the drawings on paper and made it from plywood
