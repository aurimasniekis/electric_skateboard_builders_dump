10s builds seem really popular, but it seems like 12s has a lot of benefits. The extra voltage means you can gear down 1.2x more, so for the same torque you only need about 80 percent the current, which means your motors are only subjected to roughly 64 percent the heat. That should pay off huge in long term durability, not to mention the instant 20 percent bonus in torque. Is it the erpm limit on the VESC that keeps us from going 12s? The more expensive BMS?

true and many builders swear by 12s. Personally I’ve mostly used 10s because you still have a ton of torque and power using 15/36 gearing on 80-90mm wheels and it’s cheaper, lighter, requires less space. Also, unless you’re really heavy Or ride really long hills, the heat isn’t much of an issue with 10s and proper gearing.

theres no less heat in the motors running 12s instead of 10s.  less current taken from the battery for the overall same wattage yes but "motor amps" will be different than the amperage that comes from the battery.   on your vesc you can set both motor and battery amps.   if anything it would probably be slightly less efficient running 12s as youre riding further from the no-load speed which is most efficient.

youre less likely to blow up your vesc running lower voltage.

I don't think you mean lighter if you use 50 to 60 cells for a 10S5P or 10S6P versus 12S2P or 10S3P.

Motor heat comes from the copper resistance, which is current ^2 * resistance. There's a little bit of heat that comes from the mechanical friction of the bearings and stuff, and yeah that will go up with extra motor rpm, but that's pretty negligible in comparison to the wire heating. Since the voltage is higher by 20 percent, for the same wattage on a 12s system the current is only 80 percent. So the heat is 0.8^2, or 64 percent the heat generated by the 10s setup.

You could totally reduce the number of cells in parallel, reduce total system weight, all without reducing battery range or max power. Let's say you have a 10s6p system and reconfigure to 12s5p. Same 60 cells, same weight, same electrical wattage. You lose max battery current, but make up for it with mechanical gearing, so there's no torque penalty. And because you're drawing less current to make the same torque, you make less heat and can actually downgrade your motor to a smaller, lighter one without losing performance. You could drop from 6374 (with 80A max current) to 6354 (with 70A max current) and save 300 g/0.8 lb per motor, without any loss in performance! I think anyway, I'm ignoring motor wattage specs here because they confuse me. 1000W is VERY different at 3s than it is at 12s. I think the wattage specs are likely just kind of made up marketing numbers, even more so than the other technical specs. Itd be awesome if someone could clarify this though. 

@Hummie, can you walk me through the no load thing? I don't know how that works.

VESC can't handle 12s? That's a pity, hopefully the 6.0 starts getting accessible soon!

So the heat is 0.8^2, or 64 percent the heat generated by the 10s setup.**strong text your copper losses formula is good but remember the current going to the motor is not the same as that is coming from the battery and its effectively transformed especially at the lower speeds/duty cycle.  you will need the same current in the motor to get the same torque results regardless of the battery voltage.  no free lunch with high voltage....or you could get an esc that could take a 300v battery and theoretically have a cool motor but not possible.  the esc makes an "effective voltage" using pwm, flickering the on and off,  and that is the voltage the motor sees.  that's what drives the current**

@Hummie, can you walk me through the no load thing? I don’t know how that works.
**no load speed is just the speed that the motor will spin with no load on it and based on its voltage and kv at full throttle.  if you look up the grin motor simulator you can do a comparison of a 12s or 10s system with all other variables equal and the 10s will be a hair more efficient.  the system is more efficient when running at it's highest speed, or closest to its no-load speed   running a super high voltage has the same effect as having a motor with a super high kv and its more inefficient.   yes the wire resistance is less with higher kv but it needs more amps to get the same torque.  it all balances out really and you CAN get about the same losses going maybe 2s and 1000kv or 20s and 100kv.  its close but with the 2s system it will have to be capable of doing a huge amount of amps for the same performance, if even possible, and that esc is rare, or huge, or non-exisitent**

It's not a bottle neck. Texas Instrument's DRV830x chip is currently the only chip on the market to run with a max 60V. You have to go for a different design and topology using dedicated mosfet drivers and a 12V circuit to drive higher voltages and currents.

Which means it's the bottleneck

It is the part of the design constraining it to 60V.  That's literally what "bottleneck" means, because this thing replaces all that but only goes up to 60V

@Jmding... the KT constant is **torque per amp**... so the torque is directly proportional to the motor current, not the battery voltage. you cannot expect the same torque with 80% of the motor current by increasing the voltage from 10S to 12S.

for example 10S vs 12S, 60a motor current limit, 60a battery current limit, full throttle acceleration -- during acceleration you get the same torque, same heat and same efficiency from both motors, but the 12S can spin faster.

[quote="professor_shartsis, post:1078, topic:25251, full:true"]
i ran a comparison for **10S vs 12S… 60a motor limit 60a battery limit for both…**

**the electrical to mechanical conversion efficiency in the motor doesn’t seem to be affected (green line top left chart)… but you lose a few miles an hour of top speed with 10S.**

**system-wide it would appear you may lose a little bit of efficiency with 10S because, as seen in the bottom right chart, at 10S you have to draw a few more amps from the battery at all speeds to maintain the same 60a motor amp limit in the motor, and consequently you generate a bit of extra heat in the battery wires with 10S compared to 12S, lowering the system-wide efficiency.**

[quote="professor_shartsis, post:1080, topic:25251, full:true"]
interestingly I did a **second 12S vs 10S comparison with 60a motor limit and 30a battery limit** (instead of 60a motor 60a battery)

in the new comparison you get **higher motor efficiency with 10S above the speed that you hit the 30a battery limit because above this speed you get less motor current at the same 30a battery amps with 10S… and less motor current means less heat generated and consequently greater efficiency.**

(notice the green line top left chart – **motor electrical to mechanical conversion efficiency – gets a slight boost with 10S**)

12s fully charged is nearly 10v short of the drvs voltage limit. If the vesc cant handle 12s its not because of the drv. Ive been running 12s now for hundreds of miles, however i use active cooling with increased capacitance too.

This is 100% false.  I'm not going to repeat this very many more times unless I start invoicing for my time.  If you're not an electrical engineer yet are speaking as-if this is fact, then maybe take a step back.

Firstly, when you are driving inductive loads (like motor windings) the voltages spike plus and minus when fed with square waves.

Secondly, most consumer goods are designed to operate at about 60% of their ratings.  This means things keep working.  When unexpected things happen, there is room.  Things like automobiles and things where safety matter a lot more use bigger margins.  So using that formula, it's only good for 8S.  So 10S is even pushing it.  For something your life could depend on.

Feel free to push this 12S thing all you want but when you hurt yourself because you don't listen, I won't be there for you.  When other people hurt themselves because of your bad advice, that's between you and them.

Also, if you jumped off a bridge and lived, it means I can jump off a bridge and live too.

My first build was 12s with Car esc's and I had a lot of problems with overheating motors and electronics.
When I switched to Vescs, I also switched to 10s and have not had any overheating problems since.
I did have a lot more power with 12s and the esc's. So much that it was hard to control.
The Vesc/10s setup was much tamer.

Now the bottleneck it the max voltage of a BLDC motor. It's great, but Gate Drive is 1A and the buck regulator can only output 350mA because of the high voltage.

@chuttney1 What about the LM5109 drivers? 100v max. It is not integrated like the DRV so you need 3 if my memory is correct. But it works, I do have 2x VESC built with this at home. It just didn't receive love from the community.

I think it was stated that the DRV is being run in the VESC above "safe" limits above 40v no? But a lot of people are able to run 12-13s safely with the new ones. So why not.

There is no single answer as the data is so fuzzy,  Im not surprised so many fail, esp the way you see ppl treat them.

Factors like putting them in tiny enclosures with no air rattling about and huge long supply cable not even cabled tied together are all factors that aren't helping. Many people abuse these things. 

Not to mention there seems to be a design flaw, the drv does seem to fail a lot and in a specific spot even at 10s. After studying the datasheet, i made an educated guess on what i think is causing some of the problems and added extra protection on and off chip, as have some of those manufacturing vescs.

Someone really needs to sit down with it with an oscilloscope and do some extensive testing to give you a more definitive answer.

As for 13s, that really is too close to the drv limit, as b264 stated above, you need to leave some breathing room, esp as the stock caps are all 63v and under.

Im off to bed :D

So between 10s and 12s, the heat is largely the same on the motors with it slightly higher on the wires for 10s due to the higher amp draw from a lower voltage pack? Trying not to get lost in the technical stuff lol

If that was the case wouldnt getting thicker wires mitigate the heat?

Look here is the truth. It doesn't matter the series count. Over 13s you will kill escs no matter what

I think the real problem is people's builds
- vibration dampening
- good soldering
- good covered connections
- good dust proofing 
- not taping or hot gluing pinned connections in place
- using antispark switches with the wrong type of fets so when it fails it doesn't backflow to battery and the ESC blows
- having a shitty power connection or your board is off, remote is on and you are rolling fast enough to generate bemf to power on the controller, it brakes and there's no where for the current to go and it pops.

I think most Focbox failures are related to all the above which is basically user error.

Basically the margin for user error is high on any voltage.. lol

[/quote]

@Jmding I think the benefit of 12S you are pointing out is this...

Suppose I am willing to accept 10S performance from a 12S battery upgrade, in other words 10S top speed and acceleration with a 12S battery pack, and to achieve this I am willing to increase my gear ratio by a factor of 1.2, and lower my motor amp limit by a factor of (1/1.2 = 0.8333), in this case the motor efficiency increases with 12S (green line, top left chart) and the motor heating decreases with 12S (purple line, top middle chart), while acceleration between the 2 systems is identical (yellow line, bottom left chart - vehicle thrust in pounds), and the top speed is nearly identical (yellow line, bottom left chart - vehicle thrust in pounds).

Still there is no bonus 20% wheel torque with this arrangement, only greater efficiency.

We can talk theory all day, but something that works 80% as good at the extreme ends of the operating conditions and similarly good through the rest of the more normal conditions, but with a smaller failure rate, is clearly better.

Wow... Why do theory discussions always get so heated? It seems like there is a body of evidence that suggests 12s+ likely leads to premature failure. Being a forum community, we don't have great data to confirm this, but between the 60V nominal rating being very close to 12s voltages and the empirical evidence, going beyond 10s should be considered "at your own risk". We can all agree on that I think? 

So then we should know what the reliability / safety trade off is. Which I contend is still 20 percent more torque (assuming you gear to the same top speed) 

Prof, yes the benefit is because of the 1.2x change in gearing. I don't see why you don't have more torque though. Both setups have the same Kt and current. But the 12s setup has more gearing. Therefore more torque no? Said another way, the 12s setup is capable of more electrical wattage AND more efficiency, so it must be capable of more mechanical wattage?

Prof, yes the benefit is because of the 1.2x change in gearing. **I don’t see why you don’t have more torque though**. Both setups have the same Kt and current. But the 12s setup has more gearing. Therefore more torque no? Said another way, the 12s setup is capable of more electrical wattage AND more efficiency, so it must be capable of more mechanical wattage?
[/quote]

**in the last example the motor current setting on the 12S was reduced from 60a motor current to 50a motor current limit**, a reduction factor of (1/1.2 = 0.8333)... in addition to increasing the gear ratio by a factor of 1.2... this is why they both have the same wheel thrust and top speed, and why **the 12S system in the previous example had lower motor heating** (purple line, top middle chart - ohmic heating watts 2 motors bldc).

but suppose instead you increase the gear ratio by a factor of 1.2 with the 12S system, but **leave the motor current at 60a limit for both**... now you have **increased efficiency with 12S** (green line, top left chart) & **increased thrust with 12S** (yellow line, bottom left chart - vehicle thrust in pounds), but the **motor heating is the same** for both (purple line, top middle chart - ohmic heating watts 2 motors bldc), top speed nearly the same for both (yellow line, bottom left chart - vehicle thrust pounds 2 motors bldc) & **battery amps lower with 12S** (purple line bottom right chart - battery amps 2 motors bldc).

I must admit that I'm genuinely surprised by the idea of people pushing the limits so far for little to almost no gain in real life scenario.

The thought of having a much higher chance of malfunction in my board while driving at 25+ mph and being thrown head first into tarmac or in front of the car, scares me to death. Therefore I use 10s wich I still think its a bit of a stretch. 

Again guys electric boards don't have redundancy one failure means total failure, and that could easy be the line between life and death for someone. 

Stop giving dangerous advices to people, just because your are doing something and it went OK so far. 

My i suggest that one of the guys with a good reputation makes a poll where people can vote about the rate of failure and the voltage they where using. If many enough people answer that could give us a somewhat clearer picture. 
Maby 
@Hummie, @professor_shartsis @chaka @onloop   could be the right person. 

Best regards from an engineer who has learnt d through his study that you should always aim to have at least 20 to30% headroom. Specially considering the outcome in case of a failure.

~10 km/h speed increase going from 10s to 12s. That's difference between holding up traffic and being able to move with traffic around where I live. Gear ratio sometimes can't be tweaked. Now I have both torque and speed/E-MTB.

Dual drive, dual receiver. Redundancy right there.

I suggest you try a 10S battery connected to 2 independent drivetrains - each one having an ESC, a receiver, a motor, and a drive wheel.  So the ESC are not connected together except for the main battery + and - wires

That way if you have a failure, it's very likely that you will still have one wheel with power and brakes still

Right.  No CANBUS and no split PPM.  Not all RC controllers can do this.  I know the mini remote can and I know another one can, but I forgot which other one.

The only connection between the drivetrains are the main power wires and radio waves

I can hardly belive that. How fast are you going with 10s and 12s. Assuming that you go 50kmh in 10s that would translate in theoretical 60kmh with 12s. Air resistance, spin resistance and more other factors play inn and they grow almost exponentialy with speed increases. So I do suggest you try and measure the real speed differences first. And don't go by the calculator. 
So here comes my 3 questions :
1)How often and for how long do you ride at 60kmh by the way. 
2)most of the time people have to chose between 10s5p or 12s4p. Have you thought for the slight voltage såg that you will get with a lower available current draw?
3) Are you aware that motors also have an efficient voltage range so even if you raise the voltage could mean that the efficiency drops a bit.


So adding :
Air resistance, 
Roll resistance, 
Motor efficiency 
Lower number of parallel cells 
And some other factors that I'm not remembering right know, your real speed increase is far smaller than your theoretical. Except maby downhill and in vacume.

BTW, will running 12s but limiting erpm in VESC firmware to 10/12*3.7*Kv be effectively as reliable as 10s? Will the VESC basically cap itself at 80 percent duty cycle and replicate 10s? That might be a reasonable way to combat voltage sag on low parallel count setups

with the new vesc versions having a higher possible amp setting (150 motor amps on the flipsky 6.6)  going down in voltage need not decrease the power.  maybe go 10s and higher kv motor and up the motor and battery amp settings and get even better performance than on 12s with the safety margin.

Yeah, can't not go to work/grocery shopping because it's snowing/raining/whatever.  But I don't need traction control, it's just like driving a car in snow: go really, really slow and assume you have no traction.

In those circumstances, having a robust drivetrain and knowing it won't fail on me is part of that, and being 10S is part of that

Just checking because I was going to run ppm cable for a nano which can’t bind to two receivers. What’s wrong with ppm? I thought if one vesc blows/loses power you will not blow your other vesc via ppm so its just as safe as having two separate receivers?

These types of comments make me chuckle

[quote="b264, post:38, topic:65801"]
We can talk theory all day, but something that works 80% as good at the extreme ends of the operating conditions and similarly good through the rest of the more normal conditions, but with a smaller failure rate, is clearly better.
[/quote]

Bumps don't cause this. If you are on the throttle it is the same as down hill. Except instead of going downhill with throttle engaged and never going over max speed. You are talking about wheel lift. Well the only way the wheel can spin faster is with throttle, if your on the throttle you can't outspin erpm. And since it's wheel lift and not downhill, if you take your finger off the throttle the wheel has no other way to increase speed.

Voltage spikes happen during braking, not acceleration. Having traction control on(which I use) also doesn't use braking to control power to the wheels. It just cuts power to the free spinning wheel. Cutting power cannot make a BEMF higher than your pack. THE ONLY way you are getting voltage spikes is from braking. Spikes that can kill the speed controller on any Series count 13s and below is a problem outside of the system voltage.

Meaning if you get voltage spikes no matter the series count. It's because user error. Ie you have a broken series connection so your pack spikes, or your antispark has failed, or the controller has come unplugged. 

Bottom line the only way your gonna make a BEMF higher then your pack is going downhill free coasting not holding throttle and achieving a speed faster then your gearing, and then applying the brake.

So the bumps theory is out, aside from vibration damage.


Also, there's only 3 of us on 13s that are complete, myself, pshaw, and @sk8l8r, and maybe @longhairedboy son. While I'll support 13s all day, not a single one of you have any room to knock it. You have never experimented with it or tried it. So pretty sure my analysis of the real problems in my last post are as accurate as they can be. Failure is user error.

@b264

VESC on 12S is fine. ITs literally all i have ever built. VESC from certain vendors who build cheap shit are not fine. 

FocBox runs 12S notoriously well. It is a VESC, it was originally called the VESC-X and I still have those in my daily rider.  

OllinBoardCo VESCs have ALWAYS run 12S fine... I have a pair in a bin that's 3 years old and they still run great, i only took them out because i needed to test something else. 

MayTech has multiple 100+ amp VESC 4.12 derivatives that run 12S fine and are even rated for FOC. They're fine. 

So wtf are you even talking about?

If you have room for 40 cells, go 10S. If you have room for 50, go either way, but 10S would likely be better here unless you just want 12S4P.  If you have room for 60 or more cells, just go 12S. 

I don't use P groups lower than 4 cells in general, which is how i came to those numbers. There are benefits to higher count p groups. 5 in my opinion is a good balance of performance and cash.

My only issue with 13S is the odd pgroup and weird stacking required. However, if you have room for 40 cells, why not just go with 39? Bamboo sleeper anyone?

13S is fine. The FocBoxes can handle it fine. 13S will be pushing it for the Unity, but the Unity will also handle 12S perfectly well on delivery day. 13S will not run well on any MayTech 4.12 derivative to my knowledge. The VESC6 derivatives may be able to handle it. We'll probably burn the FlipSkys up at 13S in the coming months. 

I've also heard rumors that on the focboxes the ERPM limit is a myth. In fact, drunken discussions were had involving an experiment with focboxes and a set of NTM 270s at 12S. There may be a reality check on the soon. 

My personal belief is that 12S is more efficient and runs cooler. That's my observation, Math may say something different.

Well, as far as I know we run most of us current control with brake no reverse. If you haven't noticed with for e.g. 20% throttle you can reach top speed because it controls current and while current is limited motor can start spinning faster because consumption decreases and voltage increases at least that my observations when I am cruising and keeping same throttle position and board in long distance gets faster...

So if you wheel lifts up it starts to spin faster because of load disappearance? 

But maybe it's that watt mode as I am running ack firmware...

P.S. Take everything with grain of salt I am just assuming based on observations here :D

149 kv at 10s was around 34 km/h (racing bike clocked that and was able to follow me) and 12s around 43, clocked by my wife following me by car (I wasn't going full throttle). It's a 50 km/h zone where most people drive a bit slower due to the many intersections. 

I run high c lipo. I can run full throttle up until 3.74V before voltage sag becomes an issue and pushes the lipos below my voltage alarm settings (3.7).

E-MTB. Efficiency is not really a concern for me personally . I want to get up a hill fast and 12s is doing a considerably better job, to a point where I find it hard to believe myself. Not much difference in motor heat. Focbox also remains cool, despite the crazy hot summer we have had in Europe. K3glis dual enclosure is efficient/he mentioned he personally runs it at 80a 12s without hitting thermal throttling. 

I do have less range now, but I switched from 4x8000 to 4x5000mah.

I would suggest you to ride past a road radar with both 10 and 12s. Car odometer usually have quite high error margin(that's in purpose, bigger tire size than stock can make it even worse) . Depending a bit on the car producers but some can have up to 7~8%. I had 8% on a Nissan car. While driving 100kmh the radar did show 92kmh.
It is not given that the bicycle is right either. So I would really suggest you to check that again.
What about the batteries where they the samme type, same output?
If not then they are not comparable.
