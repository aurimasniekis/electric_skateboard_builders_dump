I recently mounted my battery enclosure on the top using a short board and i may have fallen in love. I was never a fan of shortboards but a single 6374 focboxed 10s may have changed my mind!!!! I had it mounted underneath before but i had a deck which was to low to place a battery underneath.... since then if i can place it on top I will.

is this question related to the purpose of the deck?
Never ever I would go with a battery mount under the deck on a mtb.
just too much ways to crash it.

ok ok... there is a way around ;)
get some metal cage to strengthen the enclosure, than I would maybe go this way :sweat_smile:
but still, love my top mount boxes.
Didn´t liked the look before, but it´s just so much more practical.
Especially as I take the Lipos out after each ride.
