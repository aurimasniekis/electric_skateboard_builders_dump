I have been in contact with a company that has been making high precision bearings for a lot of different uses.  I originally talked to them when silverfish was still around but figured I would bring the opportunity here. 
This was copied from an email that the representative has I have been speaking with said.  Originally was looking at it as getting them for my custom boards but figured I would open it up to anyone interested.


Zealous bearings have a precision rating of A0, while our precision rating is A3 
We offer a TECAPEEK cage for our current 608 bearings which is a fiberglass reinforced cage.
The description of the Zealous bearings on the link you provided does not mention anything about the cage material. This is why the TECAPEEK cage 
We also have two options for the 608â€™sâ€”Steel
                                      
HY608-2RS PEEK P63 3.85/ piece
HY608-2RH PEEK P63  $3.85 / piece
608-2RS PEEK P63  $2.24 / piece
608-2RH PEEK P63   $2.24 / piece
 
HY = Hybrid, Silicon Nitride Balls
RS = Light Contact Seal
RH = Heavy Contact Seal
P63 = P6/A3 precision with C3 clearance

watt hours and kilometers???

To be honest I'm not sure they actually would make a huge game changing difference it the eskate world. They would more likely make a difference in the push skating world because higher precision and the peek cage. Add a nice lubricant and you have a bearing that will spin for a long time. 

These are true abec3 bearings not the Chinese abec 9 bearings that are actually zero or less

Oh, yeah.
I remember that topic.

What Eskate needs from its bearings it turns out is simple endurance.
People here put down the miles on their setups that are almost unbelievable.

The other thing I think is for the bearings to be fail safe. For that a Fiber re-enforced cage might not be a bad idea. I have no idea if thats common or not.

How do they handle saltwater?  100 miles of saltwater?  Is the failure mode "slowly getting hard to turn" or "ball exploding and abrupt stoppage"?

Because if a bearing checked off all the boxes except "balls exploding", that'd be a "Shut up and take my money" item

The ceramic ones seem really good until you experience a failure...

The idea is that we need real innovation where the grease type is not the only thing between them and failure.  Because enough miles will cut through ***ANY*** grease type.  What about making the ball from something that is inert to saltwater?  Something that doesn't explode under duress like ceramic does?

How do car bearings deal with this?  This is apparently a solved problem already, we just need to apply it to esk8.

It's not sea -- I'm in Saint Louis

It's when it snows and they throw salt all over the street, then the snow melts.  You're rolling through a street covered in dirty black brine half of the year.

Cars don't have that -- and their bearings aren't exploding -- so we are missing something here....

Iâ€™m not sure what other companies use for ceramics but these are silicone nitride which are used in the automobile industry and have been used by NASA. The company that I have been in contact with has been doing business with companies that need higher performance bearings than the needs of skaters.

The heavy contact seal is what's missing ^

Skate bearing companies like to use light seals because they free-spin better, and the  self proclaimed skaterbois like to see their wheels spin longer than other skaterbois setups.

Suspension for one thing.
I guarantee a car driving w/o suspension would wreck its bearings fairly quickly.

Also I think scale is working in cars favor here.
How small of a defect will stop a tiny skate bearing ball from rolling? how man micrometers of wear before there's dangerous slop?

Also the fact that cars don't really care at all about how much seal drag or grease drag there is, and skaters are resistant to both those things.

FYI I've pulled apart busted car wheel bearings with over 100k miles on them and guess what? They still had grease in them.

Better seals will make a world of a difference. 

Car bearing still get rusty on the outside where they are exposed but unless thenseal is.busted the inside always has grease.

Metal "shields" are not as effective as rubber "seals". There are rubber "shields " (bones and zealou... pretty much all skate bearings) and rubber "seals" (fishing-reel bearings, rc bearings, industrial bearings and etc.). For most, shields may be good enough. For me, there's no question that seals are the only option.

Metal shields (standard 608zz bearing) effectively do nothing. It is marginally better than an unshielded bearing, but it won't do anything to keep sand or dust out.

![IMG_20181120_025630|530x500](upload://1eh9vB7ZYtEgNqR8w4rMucDUvur.jpeg) 
As you can see, this bearing is not stepped. No skate bearings are, actually. (that I've found)

This kind of seal is what you want.
![New-sealing-3-250x150|250x150](upload://nUNKDHAtmH43LUENIOrCHMnQqp3.png) ![New-sealing-4-250x150|250x150](upload://kbDtmuPqzJiYtA0OcExhOEcMuSm.png) ![New-sealing-2-250x150|250x150](upload://qcybbnp9917Gc3JEt2vc0sDwhTX.png) 

**ANY one of these three configurations will be MUCH better than ANY skate bearing.**

Unless you can get an actual sealed bearing then I see no point in selling a "new" bearing.


Anything short of having real seals will just end up being marketing hype for "advanced" materials to make a bearing that's going to wear out just as quickly as any other premium 608 bearing. 

Grease doesn't really matter that much, so long as it has grease it's probably fine. Keeping out crap is the most important thing for our harsh environments.

Ask your manufacturer for a "heavy contact rubber seal engaging with a stepped inner race."

You simply got a good brand from the start.

@briman05 
Bearings "tech" is **way** overrated given all the benefits from precision roll etc are overdone by all the radial forces we apply on them. (Simply standing on your board makes the benefits null, wheel quality and diameter have a much higher impact on your ride) 

What's important however is : is a bearing rigid enough around the axle and is it sealed properly?

So yea go for industrial bearings when you can. This or SKF will rock easy. Zealous have the benefit from having a rock solid inner "ring" (no need for spacers so no play around axle possible).

BTW If you were to absolutely look for a sick bearing material, look for FAG Cronitect bearings (I forget the compound, begins with CrMo... And can't remember the rest, info must be available) and ask the same ultra hard metal from your manufacturer.

If you press bearings on and off shafts or housings but do it the wrong way, so youâ€™re pulling or pushing on the outer part of the bearing when itâ€™s going on or off a shaft, or vice versa, the cheap ones get pitted races with their softer metal and wonâ€™t spin smoothly anymore.  An easy test of the metal.  Iâ€™d test them and not take their word on anything

So it turns out that HCH bearings (as well as many other brands) _**are**_ industrial bearings. As such, their free-spinning is not great... unless they are in a wheel. Then, and especially after breaking them in, they roll SO well! 

@b264 , I have half a mind to send you a set of these for you to destroy. Still running 608's?

Look at this on eBay http://www.ebay.com/itm/130565237238
Can't beat a set of 10 for $12. So far, I've replaced my idlers, front wheel and motor (Ã—1) bearings with them. They seem to be as maintenance free as bearings get, and they're so cheap why even bother when they need it? @Deckoz they might even save you some time lol
Anyway, the seller linked above has all shapes and sizes of this particular brand for around $1-$2 a piece.

Edit: oops, that's the motor bearings. Here's the 608s:

I think it'll be hard to find one that doesn't rust on to the axle, that's just the limit of steel. More carbon and better hardness = more ability to rust vs More rust resistance = softer material and greater risk of pitting and failiure.

I work on automotive bearings all the time. The key differences are:

1.) The outer races is generally really wide, allowing for more grease. You literally put GLOBS of it in there, I think this is the main protection. The sheer amount of grease you can fit in there is just more. 

2.) multiple levels of sealing(generally a rubber seal, and a metal press fit cap.

3.) no dirrect contact with road debris(further from the ground).

4.) They dont use ball bearings like we use, they use roller type bearings:

They sit on a small nubs and press in I think.

The benefit to this is that they don't explode..... It will still works even if a few of the rollers fail. But normally they just start to spin slowly and make noise before an actual failure.

The solution is a custom skate truck with integrated replaceable wheel hubs(NOT HUB MOTORS, **HUBS**)

I mean, it's a bearing so it should be as precise are possible or that will effect the overall life(which is our goal anyway.)

Iv'e thought about using the wheel as the bearing seat, but a hub built into the truck would still allow you to use normal longboard wheels, and not have to replace some super expensive cored wheel every time. it wears out. 

 Then we can just bolt the wheels to the hub, e z p z. 

EDIT: This would also solve this whole axle strength/thickness issue we have been having as well(with the carvons, and hub motors).

Could view changing hub tires like changing ur wheels but not wasting all the inner part which is still good. 

 Hub motor tires dont need a core and can be inexpensive.  Itâ€™s less material. Iâ€™d have thought theyâ€™d need a core but doing well without so far.

I was talking to one of the engineers and they had said if it was full ceramic then they could see them exploding.  And could even see the ceramic and steel dying because there are varying degrees of ceramic.  She said these would be Silicon Nitride balls with steel racers.  She also said that if someone ever breaks the silicon Nitride ball to send them a picture and they will send out a replacement.  I'm asking abut the grease and the labyrinth seals.  Stainless Steel bearings might be what you may be looking for so they don't rust.

This is what my contact had said 

The 608â€™s do indeed have what are you referring to as a laby seal. What I was mentioning below was that the 608â€™s do not have the extra inner race groove for the seal to protrude into. So from a sealing stand point, these bearings do a darn good job.

Per what you were saying, blowing up a hybrid bearing (hybrid = steel races w/ ceramic balls), is a bit surprising to hear. This is obviously not impossible, but it would be interesting for us to hear about the circumstances in which this happened. In no way should this be common for any quality hybrid bearing.


Per the salt roads in the winter, this skater is going to have to accept some level of contamination as icy/salty roads melt and this liquid splashes against his wheels. The heavy contact seal (RH), is probably going to be a darn good option for sealing against this liquid for longer periods of time. The RH seal is much different from the standard RS seal (light contact) and is extremely different than the Z shield, which has a gap. Even if this skater would choose a SS option, these harsh conditions are bound to put more wear and tear on the bearings.

 

All of our greases are more than sufficient for the skateboard applications, even under these extreme conditions. Water has the ability to wash out any economical grease and most non-economical greases. There are options to partially overfill the bearings with grease to help prevent some of the issues this skater is seeing. You would have to know the specific customer order to overfill the grease under specific circumstances, this is not something you want to do as a standard. Both higher grease fill and RH seals (vs RS) will create more resistance after installation and somewhat continued vs. other options. If I were specifically this skater, I would set up my board/bearings for the winter vs. other seasons

Wow, $15.39 each for [HY608-2RH PEEK P63 VG001](https://verinentbearing.com/product/hy608-2rh-peek-p63-vg001/) is $123.12 excluding pulley bearings.  If they last through brine and grit though, they'd be worth it in the end...

So I got my discount for the bearings. I'm check with them to see if they could just drop ship a set to you so you can be a tester and eliminates the extra shipping. Figured if they work for you then they will work for basically anyone. Price would be about $50 for a set of 8 hybrid bearings may be different once I get the shipping figured out I figured a 50 spot isnt to bad for high precision bearing. What is the zip? . You can pm me if you want.

I'm still *super* doubtful that it will bring any benefit over cheaper hard steel on steel bearings packed with the _same amount of grease_ inside.

I've used zealous ceramics for a very long time now for both eskate and downhill. They are packed with grease from the start and free spin is pretty average when new(spin them in the air). In the real world under load it makes literally 0 difference. I could switch to bearings that would spin for 2 minutes (that were of similar or higher cost) without stopping and the thin grease would always stop sooner on the board. Not only that they run dead silent. 
What I'm getting at is - A bearing under 60-100kgs and full of grease probably won't have it's top speed or rolling distance greatly change vs the same bearing with a thin grease. 
For me what I want isln a bearing is something high quality with built in spacer, ceramic and a good ceramic grease. Do this and I'd be interested in giving it a go over the zealous.

Note that my friends and I have been using them for years multiple times a week with no failures. One friend is currently using them to get to work daily running almost 40km a day. Just wipes them clean and keeps going.

I understand that you are doubtful about high priced bearings I am too. Thus why I have always use zealous they run smooth and have built in spaces and speed rings and are cheap. When I originally started looking at these the now president of the company was the person who I was speaking with when he was an engineer a few years ago when he was with a different bearing coming one that did German manufactured bearings. I was able to get @b264 silicon nitride bearings for less than probably any other hybrid bearings.

you want a bearing that lasts then go for a scooter bearing.  No other discipline puts as much pressure on a bearing period.  Hard side ways hits and massive impacts.  These are 608 size with a 10mm shaft.  
Go to a scooter store and buy specific scooter bearings.  Forget ceramic.  They are good initially then fail with catastrophic results.  Bad steel just keep rolling, bad ceramic disintegrate.

Ceramic is fine as long as you don't assume skaters are using full ceramic bearings. :joy: Hybrid ceramics are what you want, just the balls. Slather them with a good amount of ["ball butter"](https://www.ollinboardcompany.com/product/nano-ceramic-bearing-grease) and they last as long or longer than the steel variant. Also if you are paying over $30 for a set of ceramics you are wasting your money.

I assume he means for pulleys that have built in bearings. Zealous have spacers AND speed rings built in. The speed ring spacing (.5mm) probably interferes with using pulley bearings.

However I've found that it's much easier to just stack 3 zealous bearings and have one act as the pulley bearing. Of course it's gotta be designed around that bearing shape. But it should be standard with other integrated spacer bearings.

I mean like Zealous bearings for example where the spacer is built-in.  That's less useful, not more.  Because now I have to work around that if I want to do anything **except** what everyone else does with them.  Isn't this a DIY forum?  Last I checked, it's not apple.&ZeroWidthSpace;com

Sure it may save 3 seconds in installation, but then it eliminates most things you can use it for, aside from a "standard, traditional" skateboard wheel setup.  It makes it harder to innovate.  Also what if I need 0.2mm speed rings instead of 1.0mm speedrings?  Now my bearings have to be changed?  What if I want bearings in my pulley?  All of these things now those won't work for, and all to gain 3 seconds.  That's a terrible deal.  There is no ROI on integrated spacers and it can stifle innovation because it's one more obstacle to work around for nearly no gain.
