Hi all!

I sometimes find it hard to find new sellers/vendors of eskating parts. I know some but they dont always have what I am looking for and sometimes the shipping is really expensive.

So that is why I want to make a huge list of all vendors that sell stuff related to eskating. 

If this already exists, please point me to that post because I really need it :) 

This list is primarily for european sites but if there is an interest we could just split it up for each region.

I will start of with the ones I know and edit this post as new proposals comes in.

**General parts(A-Z)**

* [3d servisas](https://shop.3dservisas.eu/)

Nice thread! 
And yes, maybe it should, but I still find it very difficult to get an overview here. Maybe we could compile this list from that though.

Wow, had no idea that store existed. Tons of small items like connectors, heat shrink tubing, led valve caps and more. Nice!

Trying to limit this post to shops specifically eskating, that is why I didn't add all of your suggestions @pixelsilva
