Not to be rude, but I feel like this:

[quote="onloop, post:77, topic:2921"]
but i couldnt give a fuck if you are iffy about me...
[/quote]

[quote="onloop, post:77, topic:2921"]
i don't want to sell my products to everyone either....
[/quote]


and this: [quote="onloop, post:77, topic:2921"]
my primary goal is to build a sustainable business, that is scalable & will be here for the long term....
[/quote]

Don't really mesh....

You could have an amazing product, but if you're a dick to everyone who slightly disagrees with you, your customer base is going to dry up real quick.

It always seems when ever the other products Enertion sells like batteries, esc mounts, deck that they are all solid and have great reviews. The only think that Enertion sells that has biased and untested propaganda is the 6374 motor. Enertion could however be scared of china pulling an @Hummie on him and then boom, some other factory is selling Enertions motors. Just clearing stuff up. No malice intended for anyone here,

Firstly....  I am not a dick to everyone...... just to people that annoy me or who waste my time & call me names......

let me refresh your memory, You have been on this forum for just a few weeks now, within the first week or so you thought it was a good idea to call me (owner of the forum - the guy who pays the hosting fees to keep it running) an asshole because I was simply speaking my mind....??? so don't get too upset if I fire back.. fair is fair.

Now... let's address your latest comment.... here are some hot tips about business so you can better understand my comments..

1. **You can never please everyone - so don't try.**.. (the guy who wants the $400 eboard is not my customer, However I am more than happy to help them with their build - thats why i made this forum....I didnt expect everyone to buy from me, in fact this forum is helping other business grow bigger.....)
2. **Business must be profitable otherwise they are called charities.**.. if I can't make profit from selling my products, I can't offer warranty, I can't offer service or support, i can't pay hosting fees to run a free & open forum for dicks to call me an asshole on, i can't survive... no enertion!
3. **Amazing products don't just appear out of thin air,** they require lots of R&D... money needs to be spent to make them good. This money comes from profit. Innovation needs profit.

I am honestly surprised how many times I have to remind people of this simple stuff.... I am not going to lower my prices & put my business at risk, if you don't like me or my products go elsewhere...

I seriously doubt that these are your true underlying motivations for making a buying decision... most consumers act based on price & convenience... if you are in the US it is probably better that you buy from us based business so you can have better recourse for warranty claims & also lower postage costs.

Even if you hate my guts and think I'm nasty... if I drop my price on the 6374 R-SPEC to it's cost price you would want one.... If the vesc was $50 you would probably buy it from me....

This is the challenge of running business..... I could drop my prices and maybe have more customers... but eventually, the business would fail...

Price is only one piece of the puzzle, there are many other elements, you must have a very compelling offer, so good that the consumer has no choice but to buy it... I need to work on my offer more & more... hence why i am moving some manufacturing & fulfillment to US

Anyway...I suppose I could be nicer to everyone on this forum & try to get more business...... but I also don't want to be fake either.... do you really think torque boards likes everyone? he just doesn't speak his mind in public.... 

At the end of the day I would prefer just to be honest & open and speak my mind... be true to myself.... i think there are plenty of people that can respect that.

Well before enertion I worked in a retail environment for many years selling computers & other tech stuff which required me to be polite & happy and have the customer is always right kind of attitude... well that fucks with your mind eventually..... You end up hating yourself..... and your customers also start to see through the fake personality...

I decided when I started enertion that i would just be straight up honest with everyone... no bullshit, call it how it is.... i knew some folks would get hurt by this attitude... but I feel fucking great about it... being true to yourself and honest is so relieving.

This doesn't mean i don't have empathy, though...

So I am sorry if I hurt or your little hearts.

I like everyone :) I'm not that emotional to outlash. For the most part this is DIY and people do know how to find out answers on their own.

I may not speak my mind because what's the point. Agree to disagree. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion. I wholeheartedly respect that so I don't push my opinions on people.

If someone wants to talk to me, they know how to contact me. :grinning:

Funny thread though. These things do make me laugh. Source of entertainment.. :heart_eyes:

From time-to-time there are some heated discussions on this forum, mostly two passionate people who disagree about a certain topic... 


<img src='/uploads/db1493/original/2X/d/d84b65f2786e55c503ba91b1e814dc019cbb83d2.jpg'>


In many cases it's just pointless trash, but sometimes the topic is really important and could change the way we all do things... Or it could damage a persons reputation....  etc etc.

**Does the community think it is it ok for people to talk back & forth (arguing) or should we just shut up and move on / moderate more strictly?**


[poll]
 - Speak your mind?
 - Shut your mouth?
[/poll]


_NOTE: under no circumstances is it ok to directly insult an individual or group, use false accusations, or be slanderous towards someone else on this forum, you will be warned & then banned permanently._


**I personally think that discussion (heated or not) is very important and should be allowed to unfold naturally, without moderation, as long as it is done respectfully. However, that can often be really disruptive for a thread if it takes it off topic. So this thread will also be used as a dumping ground for all topics that start to go off the rails from the original topic**

the problem is everyone else is too fucking lazy to do what i have done.... all they need to do is buy my motors & do some real world testing.... if my motors are not better it should be easy to prove right?... If nobody bothers to test my shit, everyone will just have to take my word for it.

Finally, someone else out there providing evidence that my 6355 motor stators are bigger & better, up to 200 watts more power he reckons... Doesn't mention the fact that they are also treated to be waterproof too!

thanks for the link torqueboard....

hopefully this 3rd party review helps to explain to people why some motors are much cheaper! smaller magnets, smaller stators, less copper... 

here is the proof...

btw, after all, I do agree that was a biased review. A true review should be done by someone who doesn't hold a bias against a brand being reviewed. The fact that he was able to bend that metal plate at the end with his thumb is troubling. He should have cut his thumb off before that thing bent, but it did bend. I doubt an r-spec would bend under any circumstance.

I would be willing to concede that the R-SPEC is not the best motor on the market if someone can simply provide evidence that it is not.... 

ill be waiting patiently... 

they better hurry up, though... because ill probably be the one who ends up bettering my own product before anyone else gets their shit together...

You keep talking like you need a Ferrari to drive your kids to school or soccer practice.

You don't. You put it as if your driving 60 amps through each motor but your driving like 30 amps per each motor.

So in total off of 37v at max you put out 2200 watts which is not much more then a boosted.

Sometimes I think you just made this forum so you can get your rocks off. LMFAO. Enjoy your hype while you can.

The false economy is your economy. :grin:

I dont know man. Everybody got a point, everybody has its own selling point and trying to market products. But what I dont like is the comparing each other products next to each other and trying to convince that this products is definitely better than others. I mean its good for your own information and within private messages directly to individual customer, but don't tell it out loud. Its professionally unethical to directly state this thing with or without independent 3rd party test. A war that has no end and not building positivity. Its all about money after all.

And when you guys comparing within each other by looking at each other past fail, it shows lack of competence. I mean really, everybody made mistakes. Everybody have version in their own products.

It's true actually. Who here hates those cell phone commercials where verzion claims they are faster then at&t and then at&t claims to prove they are faster then verizon. It's hard for either to make the claim, because it depends where one lives. Certain places, I have friends with verzion that loose some signal and speed. The same with me, and at&t. At he end of the day, they are both decent at providing reliable and decent speeds. So it's what I call a fuck you - fuck you argument.

Hashing out like this seems to be hard for members here to do without resorting to cursing and/or childish games. It makes everyone (specifically business owners) involved seem very unprofessional. I understand not wanting to be "fake" and put on a persona, but there are better ways to argue than having to curse everyone out. State the facts and let them speak for themselves. If someone disagrees or thinks it's still false, who cares? They will probably never change their opinion, and you don't have to get worked up about proving them wrong. Agree to disagree.

While i thoroughly enjoy this bitching and baby crying shit you guy have going on here as much as the next guy, I weep for E-Boards as an emerging thing. This (forum) used to be a place where you could go to get good solid advise, and encouragement for growing this phenomena, and pushing the limits of what could be done with e-sk8s. But it is quickly turning in to a baby pen of adult babies throwing mud and lashing out at what ever and who ever, now I'm not taking ANY sides! but i don't want this (relatively) new hobby of mine ruined or to die out, because grown freaking people act like this.

Everyone get your petty shit together, and I really mean every one, if your spuring this on you'r part of the problem!

Name calling/cursing at each other solves nothing, Will. Yes, in the real world people get angry and lash out at each other. That's perfectly fine. The difference is that these are guys selling the same type of stuff arguing about who has the best. The CEO of Adidas and CEO of Nike don't have to fuck with each other in a forum to express how much "better" their products are. You know what they do? They CREATE better products and let them speak for themselves. Chances are if you have to tell people how cool you are, you probably aren't.

Haha, well I am not sure who the idiot is in your example either when I try to gain some reflective distance, so this is incredibly poignant. George Carlin has another good one..

 "Never argue with an idiot, he will drag you down to his level and then beat you with experience"

There are a few others that come to mind in this thread specifically...on the one hand "No Pressure, No diamonds.." On the other hand "Discussion is an exchange on knowledge, an argument is an exchange of ignorance" and "The purpose of argument, or of discussion should not be victory, but progress" To me this is an argument, and progress doesn't seem to be occurring. 

At first, I felt like the thread was asking about speaking freely at first when I voted, so right away I go for the obvious choice in my opinion, free speech. I think the more subtle (?) question was really, should the vendors specifically bitch back and forth, throwing accusations about and positing little actual, objective evidence of one thing on another. This is a different question entirely..The way this thread devolved, asking myself this question I would change my answer. 

Look, I understand everyone's position here. I run a small business myself. As a newcomer relatively to this forum/community ( a few months now) I have maybe not seen the whole story, but I've done enough competitive, capitalistic activity that I get the animosity that's natural to the environment. Especially when you truly believe your product is superior or a better value, but people still go for what's cheaper, mass produced, or just well marketed. It starts with playful jabs back and forth, maybe you make an attempt to work together but it falls through and then it's all out war. 

The problem is, nothing worthwhile is really getting said from what I am seeing. Just a lot of hate and anecdotal evidence. The problem then for you guys becomes a problem of perception. This is mostly a community of adults, while some find this behavior entertaining ( hell, I think all of us do sometimes to an extent) at some point it becomes petty and annoying to watch when progress is not being made. People on here are waiting forever for hand made parts from you guys, and hours are spent on this? I don't really follow this logic, as I expected long wait times going into it, but I know many people feel this way. Progress is ultimately what we all want. No one here wants to watch you guys bicker back and forth with not so witty quips about who did what first, and who's copying who. For christ's sake, is anyone here actually inventing these technologies? You guys are sourcing products, right? Maybe you are making slight modifications or coming up with a new style of motor mount for example. Other than that, you're a reseller of someone else's product anyways. 

Instead of tearing each other's products down you should be point out the positives with your competitors product ( which is likely a variant of the same/similar thing!) and then making a clear argument about why yours has the advantage, why it's better for "X" application or what have you, and leave it at that. No petty, antagonistic quips required. Trust me, this is a surefire way you will avoid being confused for the idiot.

@onloop I totally understand where you're coming from when it comes to business. I too used to work pretty menial customer service/sales jobs until I started running my own place. It's a whole different thing. And it feels great. The best thing is you don't _have_ to put up with other peoples shit if you don't want to. I think you make great points at times, you're clearly intelligent and hard working. You love what you're doing and even though you come off as a dick someime, it's hard not to respect your confidence in your products and in most cases your willingness to be helpful. 

On the other hand, I think you're going beyond being "true to yourself" at times and just being a dick when it's unnecessary to be a dick, maybe you sort of like the way it feels from the sound of it. It's a pretty classic position of power attitude that you seem to have taken on. For example, your comment above in reply to @Karmannghiagirl  and @delta_19 make some excellent points, are well thought and for the most part seem like honest replies. But does there always have to be a condescending remark? It's like you assume everyone else is an imbecile who your forced to remind the simple tenants of business when really their trying to point out a simple tenant of business to _you_ that you seem to blatantly ignore rather often, common courtesy. 

Sure, Don't be fake, be true to yourself, and "say what you mean, but don't say it mean". Take is as a naive, childish or soft quote if you like, but the point I am making is spelled out clearly by how these conversations have been taking place. You may feel attacked because you have it in your head that your putting in all this work and money to make the community grow and no one is respecting that, and on top of that they call you out for being a dick. Seems like a lot of bullshit for nothing... 

What it seems like you fail to realize is that you're encouraging them to do it by adding in the condescending remarks to  the end of nearly every post instead of just stating what's what and moving on.  I appreciate your work, and this is a really nice forum that i have loved to use and be a part of, but from day one of reading your replies to customers I have been turned off of your business. In a market of constant innovation/changes and DIY vendors and members alike I was worried that you would basically tell me to fuck off in a matter of words if I had an issue with my product. Your battery looks great for example, that new case is sleek as hell for a DIY option! Still not really enough to get past the perception for me so I ordered elsewhere, and I had an issue anyways. But so far I have had great service in dealing with it. 

Maybe I am just too sensitive, maybe your attitude is better suited to Australia than us softies in the U.S. Maybe you don't give a shit about this constructive criticism, because after all "you can't please everyone". I just think that's a poor excuse to offer subpar, hard-knock customer service because it's hard as fuck to do it all yourself and do it the way it should be done, especially when your growing and growing fast. Even if you kill yourself to make it all work. Trust me, I know. What I've learned is that you can be "real" with customers and not have the obvious caricature-like corporate personality while still being respectful of their intelligence and not totally abrasive. Maybe you're like me at the start and just over compensating, because you and I both know the customer is not always right. It may feel "fake" to just roll over for their false claims, or obvious mistakes of their own and I am not saying you always have to just give in, but sometimes that's just good business. Honestly, I think what scared me off in the first place is that I haven't seen one claim against your product by a customer or vendor without some big, ego based argument breaking out. Reality is irrelevant, Perception is everything.

**here is the deal...**

i'll try to be much nicer.....

If people call me names ill ignore them....

if people say stuff about my products that is unfounded or false ill ignore them & allow the false information to spread....

if people talk about / review / critique products that they have never used or owned... i'll also allow that, without ever questioning them.... in fact ill help spread the false information as if it were fact.

If people do dumb shit, or say dumb shit that negatively affects the reputation of the world wide electric skateboard builders movement ill allow it without even a whisper...

if people build an electric skateboard using the cheapest parts & it fails, i'll never use the phrase _"false economy bites you on arse"_

i will try to be a better, more respectful person... (if slightly fake version)  

i will not talk about other brands or suppliers of esk8 goods...  this includes giving credit where credit is due... zip, nada.

**consider me completely gagged......**


everyone, please report back in 7 days if you are feeling better about yourselves.... if you are, I will permanently change my tone...

You keep using false economy, it doesn't mean what you think it means. False economy is when someone buys a product for cheaper costs and end up paying more for upkeep and maintenance in the long term. In this thread, your product falls on the cheaper side. Though I'm not sure what the quality of your rotor is, using 'false economy' doesn't really support your argument here. 

And what's your beef with @onloop ? You come to someone's backyard and start making a fool out of the both of yourselves and you have the audacity to try to troll him? You seriously lack some common courtesy. Just drop it man (even if you didn't start the debate).  

And Jason @onloop, why're you on a warpath?  You sound like you're letting him crawl under your skin. No one is asking you to be a 'fake' person, just drop the issue. You got a company to run and bigger things to do. Enertion is making a name for itself so don't f**k it up here.

I love how torque boards has a go at onloop about his motors and shit. Then onloop calls them out and asks them to show whats inside yet they don't want too. I wonder why? 

onloop is proud of the products he is selling and is completely open about what is in them. Along with doing the same thing. 

Don't start shit if you can't back up your false claims.

All I said was, Enertion claims he has the best motors and it's an amazing feat. That nobody can ever make better motors..

If you want to believe in the hype, by my guest.

I think you guys need to do your own homework as well.

I only preach this so you know this is all unnecessary but you are free to pay for more.

https://www.radicalcreation.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=24&t=23



> I want to point out that the stators are the same diameter, have the same color paint, same coating, and even similar white markings on them. The coils also are both machine wound. This tells me that these were most likely manufactured in the same facility. So the whole part in the video about "ensuring the stators are precision machined and the coils are machine wound" is not relevant as the alien and most other motors are. The lead wires share the exact same large bullet connector (another thing enertion listed as an outstanding feature) and the alien has similar high count stranded wire for flexibility.

> Enertion made a big fuss about how all inexpensive motors use only "glue" to hold the magnets on to the rotor and that they use a special spacing ring to hold theirs. Again, this is just a bunch of BS hype to get you to pay more. Number one, this is not "glue". It is application specific epoxy formulated specifically for this purpose. Yes, the R-SPEC rotor has a spacing ring on one end of the magnets, however, this is primarily used to space the magnets for automated placement by machine in the factory. It may add extra support and extend longevity, but that is not it's primary function and almost all large outrunner motors have it. Also, the alien has not only this ring on one end, but machined grooves in the other end of the rotor for the magnets! Even better than the Enertion motor! Hmm, the R-SPEC isn't looking so unique and top quality now is it.

> Now, I shouldn't really even be talking about this, but since Enertion listed it and talked about it as being an outstanding feature, I will. Enertion motors use L-1680HH bearings. These have a dynamic load rating of about 1600 Newtons which is a little over 300 lbs. Although, I couldn't find the spec sheet for the 5800Z bearing found in the Alien Power motor, I can tell you that it is rated for about the same based on its size and design. Even if it is less, the only force it is going to see in an electric longboard configuration is the force from the belt when accelerating and it will be distributed on the two bearings. With this being said, the max force I'd expect to be on it in a dual motor config even on the steepest hill would be around 1000 Newtons.

Yet, from all that Enertion says I have a bigger stator.. I'm better.. lol

Enertion: 537$

5% difference.

I think the two companies are equally priced when looking at the bigger picture.

It's a few paragraphs, if you add up your replies they are probably about the same, but spread out over _more_ time and _less_ thought out or on topic. This took a few minutes, and I sort of care about the topic so I don't see how it's a waste of all this excess time you assume I'm spending. :smiley: 

And @delta_19 I do type pretty damn fast nowadays...

@onloop No one is asking you to gag yourself to spare our feelings. No one is asking you to be fake, if you have to fake being nice and respectful, that's on you man. I merely suggested it might be a good business move to be less condescending to your customer base and the community as a whole. It's almost like it's automatic for you though.  I hate to say it, because again you clearly know your shit and have provided us a ton of information and a place for it, but if anyone is putting people off of this community, it's you. Not just you, there's a lot of  this going around, but you asked for the opinions. 

Like it or not, you've made yourself a head of the community, not some background character just running servers. Every post you make reflects on the community as a whole, and every post comes off so condescending and sarcastic it makes my head spin. You say you like to be "real", but sarcasm is psychological tool number one for concealing emotions and boy is there a dose of it in that last reply.. It's not about a gag order or us  "feeling better about ourselves", but of course you had to add a few quips to top it all off, and make it _our_ issue for not wanting to be talked to like we're retarded...  Here's the bottom line, you can speak your mind freely, defend yourself intelligently and also not be a total cunt about it. 

Peace.

now you are making stuff up about me..... which is not really a really nice thing to do, most of my posts are informative & are meant to be a positive contribution to the community. I doubt you will find anyone who will deny that.

You are also being very hypocritical, you are basically doing to me what you claim i do to others... 

You have made a very broad generalised statement about me which is very offensive & untrue. Please stop.

i think everyone just needs to stop taking everything so personally.... lighten up....ill also be taking my own advice too... 

**if i have offended anyone please PM me and explain the situation... i will be happy to discuss it & apologise.**

Anyway, I am going to take a break from this forum for a few weeks maybe more, i feel like i have done everything that i set out to do, I have also appointed 5 new moderators who will be able to do a much better job than i can at being impartial. 

I've got some big projects that need my full attention so will be focussing on those

First I don't know why Enertion is being blamed alot for the RSpec motor. I mean it's not recently released, it's already since last year and there were no complaints about it. I am not a pro-enertion, but this should not come by just now. If Enertion would like to sell larger stator with more expensive motor it's fine, you can't blame companies making profit. The claims on larger stator = more expensive could be legit since I have never opened them up. But smaller motors or other motor brands should not be taking it personally, it could also be marketed by quality and budget friendly. You all know your own products unique selling points.

For me the Enertion false economy is the VESC. It's been switching manufacturers one after another but the quality still not the best for less price. Its a hard truth.

I am not a seller, just an eboard builder. I also don't buy rspec because it's expensive neither do most motors other members sell. I just bought SK3 for price, performance as well as most early build were using it. Buyers when they gona spend 100 bucks for motors, not el cheapo, would think - read and estimate. Up until now I don't know who have the best motors, I don't even care. The differences are not so significant one to another. It's too small to make such different on short commutes compared to car.  

I think everybody should just take a brake for now. If you feel offended personally, solve it personally. To be honest this post should be visible only to certain forum member user level 2 or above due to the fact that it is the very least priority to build an eboard. All motors worked anyway.

@onloop Really? You're grasping man...let's not pretend I am sitting here talking shit or slandering you. I am giving you an honest position/opinion on your own question. My answer is based on your own choice of words and general tone. This is how I feel when I read what you write, and you provide the evidence with every reply. Pretty much what @Karmannghiagirl said..I thought it was pretty obvious that I was referring to any post of conflict, but really I was referring to every post in this thread as specific examples (including what you just did  at the end there) and I have seen the same behavior in many of your posts. 

As I have said many times now, you have contributed a LOT of information and assistance to the community. I honestly appreciate it.  If I wasn't clear enough making that point or in my writing of the above I apologize, but I stand by what I said. It seems there's always a jab at the end or some not so subtle condescending tone to the whole thing. Are you implying that any of the postings you made above are free of this behavior? It seems like you're trying pretty hard to make the tone clear in my opinion. Then again it is words on a page, so maybe I am just misreading. I am not infallible, this is just my opinion and I feel like many people share the same or similar thoughts on the matter. That is all.

But maybe we can inject some LOVE here.
Peace and love brothers and @Karmannghiagirl sister!!  Really we are all on the same team here. Let's stay positive and build up the community. Shit like this brings everyone down and scares away cool people that would otherwise love to spend time with us. Not everyone that posted is doing wrong. I feel that some of the posts were very positive and direct. I like that kind of free speech. 
Straight up! If we aren't building the community, then we are breaking it down. I voted "speak your mind", but the one caveat is that it needs to be tempered with respect and restraint. I speak my mind freely, when I feel it benefits people, but I digress when I feel that I am not being heard or when I am just honestly wrong. 
It takes far more strength of character to be peaceful, than it does to argue. PEACE UP!! :v:

I think the topic (name) doesnt reflect the reality in a forum
SPEAK YOUR MIND OR SHUT UP?
thats not many options to choose from. usually there's a healthy way of discussing pros and cons. other than blk/wht thinking.

speak your mind? yes, very yes!!
shut up? please not, if there are facts!

I joined this forum to get an exchange of ideas. I know a lot (in other areas) and know little about eSK8boards.

so I want to see people discussing/arguing about specs.
and as ALWAYS  both parties are (kind of) right and I need to do my own opinion after hearing them both
this is still DIY, so the truth from today might be wrong tomorrow.

Speak your mind

* Constructive criticism
* Cite facts

Shut your mouth

* No name calling
* Refuting legitimate facts 

The problem is we all are entitled to our opinions.  An opinion can not be right or wrong. So feel free to say why you think X is better than Y. Back up your opinions with facts and your golden. Just be aware that tone, sarcasm, and all that hub bub doesn't transfer through text.

Your capacitor is clearly shown in your video. It isn't under the black heat shrink. It looks a bit like a, well,  capacitor. But you knew that right, you're all DIY and all that.  It's a 3300uf 50v cap, because, um, it's even facing you in the vid. Got your LHB back yet? Maybe next time you could adjust your own brake settings by plugging it into BDLC yourself - learn something new, save yourself some postage, and embrace one of the many advantages of your board/s.

Thanks for pointing that out, I've updated my reply.  Yea I love DIY, but I don't know every little detail.  I've learned quite a bit and what I've learned is from the members of this forum who teach and inform myself and others... rather than going in every thread and just start an argument with anything I post.  What I learn I pass on to someone who may not know.  I'm not sure why you feel the need to say things in a negative manner.  People here are just trying to help each other, im trying to contribute and post things and take videos hoping it will help others.  

The LHB board will be back soon, it has shipped already.  I won't mess with VESC settings until I know what adjusting each of the parameters does exactly.  Also there were some other things that needed to be done besides the VESC settings, like touching up scrapes on the board using the same paint he used, him soldering something in my remote to fix it (ended up giving me a new remote anyway), and also FYI I didn't pay postage cuz longhairedboy is refusing to take any money for shipping even though I've asked him multiple times.  He even repaired normal wear and tear scrapes no charge.  Which is why I keep saying his service is awesome and better than evolve and boosted. (Again I'm sure you'll start saying something negative and how I say everything is the best for no reason like you did in the other thread).  

If you don't agree with anything I say, please PM me and let me know how it's wrong.  I'll correct it if it indeed is wrong (like I did with the capacitor) or I'll tell you why what I said is still true.

Mate, you're back at your old tricks. Passive aggressive narcissism. I saw your post before you edited it, and as a contributing member of the forum I exercised my right to balance your uninformed rhetoric, by highlighting the fact you know almost nothing about the things you pump up the most. I'm comfortable doing this in public thanks, otherwise we end up hiding in pm and your rhetoric goes unchallenged. I do it because this forum is about the only place where I don't read narcissistic rubbish and it would be nice if it stayed that way. Reddit and YouTube remain your playground, but here I'll keep calling you out unless you change, or the mods decide I don't have the right to challenge your diatribe. This is about your conduct, not any of the manufacturers that, once again, I also rate highly.

I have no idea what your issue is or what you're talking about, I posted two reviews on things I own and I'm sure it was appreciated by everyone except you.  Most people here have not seen videos and reviews of the raptor and the other board I own.  It's not narcissism or unbalanced rhetoric when I give an extremely positive review of something.  I've tried all 3 of the boards I compare.  Why don't you make your own review videos or posts if you want to challenge my "uninformed rhetoric" and opinions?

You saw my post before I edited it, so can everyone else.  It's the same except I added the word "edit" and put down yes there is a cap.  

I made all these videos, did all these reviews, and am posting my opinions at the request of forum members.  The reason I have a raptor is because of the info @Dedbny gave me months ago.  Now I'm trying to inform others of my experience by making videos and posting things I am learning.  If you have a problem with the reviews and my comments about any of the boards that I OWN and you don't, you simply don't have to be part of the thread.

@magnetvox Can I just say this. Everyones allowed to say their own opinion.  Its just sometimes the tone is unwarranted or the way its written can be taken the wrongway I think. 

@Photorph has put his opinions up.  If you want to know more than what he posts pm him. He never claims to be an expert,  but is trying to help others. Right or wrong.  Your post on the cap could just have been less sarcastic. 

Just my opinion on reading the posts. 

Post more about of your own thoughts on your board as well to help others if you havent already.

Agree 100%.  I'm not an expert, but just sharing what I have learned by riding the different boards I have and how they compare.  And also what I learned by reading this forum.  I think riding different boards gives you a good idea of how they compare.  Ultimately how they ride is most important.  

I saw a raptor and never would have bought it if I didn't get reassurance that it's a legit product.  Dednby answered my questions and i ended up buying a raptor.  Now I'm making videos and posting things to show that hey this is a great board and here is what I know about it from having it.

I'm sorry mate. You might be trying hard but I dislike you patronising posts and consistent over-the-top claims. I call it, you go back to calming it down for a few days, and then your ego takes over again. For what ever reason, you like the power to say what you like, but hate to accept that in doing so, you empower me to do the same. 

You should appreciate some honest advice. It'll make you better at being a decent source. You aren't getting it from anyone else because there is a false belief here that you can say anything without the fear you'll be corrected if you are just plain wrong. 

Time to stop with the fluffy 'you hurt my feelings, I'm just trying my best' because you own all the levers to changing this from happening.

I'll try being more constructive. Here is my advice:

Writing posts with value and being a respected source:

1. If you have to state your claim as being an expert, you probably aren't. Let your analysis/ ideas convey whether you are an expert or not. 

2. If you are prepared to make a conclusive, no alternative claim, be prepared to be challenged. Especially if it is weak or plainly sycophantic. Remember, you set the tone for the reader to either think 'reasonable point, I don't agree but that is reasonable' or, conversely 'this guy is talking complete rubbish and wasting my time'. 

3.  Every post is part of your digital reputation. I read all your posts both here and elsewhere, for no other reason than I'm part of your target audience. It's a large part of why I perceive  your narcissism. There is plenty of evidence, beyond the posts I'm responding to. If that isn't you, then take this advice and when you re-read your final draft, ask yourself how it will be perceived. Yes you have a right to say whatever you like. But what is the value if you make your voice irrelevant. 

4. If you are going to do marketing for your vendors, which I would describe as 'leveraging your reach to pump up something relentlessly in an unbalanced fashion for the primary purpose of increasing their sales', then understand the risk to your digital reputation. You might do it because you believe in those guys, because they are great blokes, and you want to help. They are all good reasons. But here is the kicker- once you do that, your integrity as an expert opinion is compromised. Integrity is hard won over a long time, and it is very quickly lost. You chose to market BB (happy to post links but I don't think there is too much doubt). You chose to market LHB, you did so even before you got the board. You chose to begin marketing Olinboards. Don't get upset if or when you want to post or share an actual expert opinion, and you get called out for marketing bias bullshit. You can't have it both ways. Your opinion is compromised for me, and when I see you post things like 'the raptor is the best board in the world, sure it's DIY, but DIY is so simple' and then I see you don't know what a capacitor looks like, and I know you never tried to tweak/fix your LHB, then I feel like you are simply filling this forum with marketing dressed up as opinion. If you guarded your credibility and integrity better in the past, I likely wouldn't draw that conclusion. 

5. Don't think I'm the sole dissenter on your integrity. I'm likely the only one bothered to write something about it. And I bother because I can see you want to be a respected voice, here and elsewhere, and it frustrates me when I see you undermine your credibility every 4 or 5 posts. 

6. You might not be a narcissist. I don't know you. I apologies if you aren't. Your real take away though should be the idea that perception is reality when we only have your posts and videos to go on. That is why you should be less defensive about what I say, and either work to alter that perception (because it seems to bother you), or embrace it as part and parcel of how your actions are perceived. Your current marketing approach has some people here think 'wow, photoph knows his stuff, and he is a great guy because he markets the sellers of all the boards he had owned' and others going 'here we go, more marketing dressed up as novice opinion'. Either drop the marketing, carefully consider every piece of messaging you do, and aim to be a respected voice to all readers, OR continuing mixing marketing with attempts to add valued contributions, but you'll need to embrace the debny 'right on brother fist pumps' AND the magnetvox 'I call bullshit' which will inevitably result from your current strategy. You own that outcome- pick your approach and if you don't change, don't whinge when your opinion gets challenged and your reputation takes hits. You might be marketing because you are passionate, enthusiastic, and excited- all good qualities, but your intent doesn't matter- the resulting perception on the value of your opinion matters. 

Good luck in your journey on becoming a trusted opinion either way. I'll step out now, I've made my thoughts clear a number of times, and I won't undermine any of your posts any further. I'll hold my opinion on your posts to myself, to give you space to take on what I'm trying to convey.  Post whatever you like. But maybe from this point forward, you will value your integrity more, and guard it at all costs.

Fuck... I thought I was the master of the rant!... however this a close contender.

It goes against my better judgement to get involved in someone else's battle.... but fuck it.

So, I think these points need to be highlighted.

1. @Photorph is not paid in anyway by enertion to say anything. It all his own words/opinion 

2. @Photorph has openly criticised enertion about service and delivery times (but who hasn't done that lately?) In fact he was about to cancel. At one point he was telling people he had waited 4 months and not got his raptor... which was (5 weeks) over exaggerated... that post alone probably caused about 4 or 5 people to cancel... I probably lost about $10-15k in presales....  so he is definitely not pro-enertion.

3. However, I would say his comments are fairly true and accurate representation of his experiences. Anyone who has ridden a Raptor (or any high spec diy esk8) tends to be blown away.... especially if they already thought that boosted boards was the best money could buy & industry benchmark... the truth is the raptor is another level that you wont get from mainstream brands... Unless people have an opportunity to have ridden a raptor &  few other mainstream esk8 brands you might not fully understand why he is saying stuff in such an enthusiastic way..... in fact I bet he has actually had to tone down his excitement to ensure he wasn't coming across as biased....


The fact of the matter is diy esk8 of any kind (built well) should easily blow away the mainstream competition.... 

.....The closest contender is evolve GT and still I could build a board that makes that look like a toy... 

Really.... the next video we need to see is GT vs Raptor. That will shut down the Internet. 

Anyway...  sorry for butting in.

Felt the need to chime in...

The whole DIY vs off-the-shelf completes is a dead-end argument in my opinion. There are sacrifices going with either routes. No one board can offer you everything at once.

I think being descriptive and objective is the key to giving an unbiased review. If you feel something is the "best", instead of just saying that, describe why you feel that way and leave it at that... I haven't read every single post of yours @Photorph so I don't know how much if at all you've used the word "best" to describe something, but just some food for thought. I'd just remove the word all together from reviews unless you add  "personally" and/or "for me".

You just made the key point @onloop- **you have to actively work to remove the perception of inherent bias** 

All vendors on this forum understand this, because you know a marketing bias will undermine your wider voice. 

If @Photorph was happy being a fanboy- no problems, I wouldn't say a thing. But he wants to be a valued voice and thus he must actively work to avoid the perception of bias. @Mr_Mahal is a solid example of how to do both. Yet blokes like mr_mahal get patronising comments from photorph because he leverages their balanced views (the good and the bad) to reinforce the superiority of whatever he is pushing on the day. This angers me, it's big note 101. 

You'll note I didn't say he marketed enertion- I left that out intentionally because I've seen his enthusiasm work against you. But I feel he was starting down that path, and that was the trigger for this blow up. He has more value to your product (everyone's product) if the rest of us don't choke on the bias. 

I've said it a few times- I believe many of his claims, your board, for example, is top of the line in many aspects. I love raptor vids because the performance, even in a video, is awesome. How he goes about it matters, unless he doesn't care, in which case no one should care if they call bullshit. 

Anyways, regarding your last point- I'm in Adelaide, I'm happy to drop off my GT to you for a day or two so you can do the hill and velodrome tests with a raptor dual. Your tests are getting better at trying to show objectivity, and your vlogs are a good medium. If you are keen, let me know. I'd recommend you get a list of things you would like this forum to see tested, just so they can get a comparison beyond pure performance, which there is no doubt the  raptor will win all day every day.

GT carbon Evolve 2G  VS Raptor Dual V1.0 on Street Versions
I already have a feeling on the outcome. 
1. CARVING    :  GT 1.5pt  RT      1.pt. Just loosen trucks. 
2. TOP SPEED:         1pt               1.5pt.  Will be alot closer than anyone thinks. 
3. DECK : Carbon      1pt               1pt
4. WHEEL OPTIONS  2pt               1pt not sure how to rate. 
5. REMOTE                   1.5             1
6. RANGE                      1.5             1 based on street. 
7.WEIGHT                     1 (7.9kg)  1.5(7. 2kg)
8. COST                         1.5           1
                                            11              9
In my opinion.  Many parameters may be considered,  but these are probably the only ones that are not subjective and can be tested or just fact.

Oh and at the end of the day whoever owns what board will love it and their both Aussie designs.  Who Ha to Boosted.

I think it would be worth showing in the video each board doing what they can do best....

For instance. The video should have a mini course where sharp turns & carving are benefits.

A section where beginners learn to ride for the first time.

One other funny thing is that the GT (as far as listed specs go) can only do 22mph on 83mm wheels. I've only ridden on 97mm due to the bad reviews on the 83mm wheels when used in most street conditions and hit 24mph on average (according to remote speedometer). @onloop  Really wondering the science behind why the GT only does 22mph with 83mm wheels while the Raptor does ~28mph. Is it the pulley or something? Or are bigger motors better for sustaining high speed?

Or you know, you can also include a race like F1 race or endurance race like Le Mans. Put it through a bunch of laps with downhill and uphill, see if you or @magnetvox can get there faster. And then eventually Enertion will sponsor a worldwide Eskate race much like Evolve's, except the race can include all eskate not just Evolve boards. It'd be good marketing.

Lower kv. GT runs a 130kv motor while the Raptor has 190kv. If you didn't already know kv is the rpm per volt. Both the GT and Raptor run 10s which is 36v nominal. You multiply 36 * kv to find the RPM of the motor. 

The gearing is more in favor of the GT side when it comes to speed, however. GT runs 2.13:1 ratio while Raptor is at 2.4:1. This more aggressive gearing doesn't make up for the lower kv though.

The Raptor actually has more torque due to the larger motors and lower gearing.

Lower gearing = more torque less top speed
Higher gearing = less torque more top speed.

There are multiple factors to speed and torque, but a huge one is the motor sizes.

Would love to see the Raptor (more specifically the R-specs) powering some AT wheels. That would be very attractive to me...only thing I wish my GT had was longer range with the AT wheels and more power. Where it's at with the AT wheels is still miles better than my boosted though so I'm alright

Wow just seeing this all this.  @magnetvox sorry my friend, I'm excited about my boards so I'm going to keep expressing my enthusiasm however I want and you keep replying however you want.  I skimmed through your gigantic reply, I'm kind of honored that someone is writing out essays advising me on how to become a credible opinion.

I still will say the raptor and my LHB are the best.  If you are butt hurt about it...keep replying, or maybe post some videos with you testing your GT against the boards I'm saying are the best.  I'm not marketing for anyone, I'm giving my opinions and they are all supported by performance facts.  I'm not making anything up.

I moved on up from a yuneec e-go to a boosted, and thus boosted seemed like the best thing in the world to me so I shared my thoughts about how it's the best thing ever.  After moving on from that to boards built from 63mm enertion motors like the raptor and the LHB, now those two are the best things in the world and I'm going to continue claiming that.  Until I find something better... but right now there doesn't seem to be any unless you build one yourself to match those.  The ollin board didn't work out, although he could have made the board I wanted, for safety reasons he concluded it's best that he didn't build it. 

There is no bias anywhere, I give the title of the best board to the best performing board.  Most of the people reading my posts are looking for the best performance as well.  Performance meaning acceleration, speed, and range.  That's what matters to me, that's what matters to most people who are also equally excited by my posts and the videos I put up.  

I never claimed to be an expert by the way.  All I can claim is my skateboarding experience, and the fact that I've actually owned and ridden all the boards I post about.  I've done objective tests on them before making claims.  It may not make me an "expert" by whatever your definition is, and I'm certainly not an expert in building boards or programming VESCS....but guess what, at the end of the day how the board rides/performs is what matters the most.  And all the stuff I post is after I ride my boards.  (yes I posted positive things about LHB before I got my board, and that was more about the uniquely awesome buying experience and watching your board get built).

Alright, I'm gonna get back to posting my raptor and LHB board videos with real world tests.  You can keep replying and telling everyone that I'm just posting narcissistic/passive aggressive/unbalanced/biased BS.

Far out. One more time just for you. You like to kick the kids and then cry foul when you get kicked back. That is butt hurt. I'm not your friend big guy. Keep it up, you just confirmed to me you are an ocean-going douche-canoe. Nice back-story, I didn't read it because I don't care. Good day.

Dude, do us all a favour and shut the hell up, Try adding something constructive to this forum rather than going after people and in general acting like a massive troll..

How do warnings work on this platform? It's been some time now and I still can't create a topic, or even message someone (only able to reply).
