Hello everybody,

I wanted to tell you my really bad experience with diyeboard.com
So I ordered my parts mid summer and everything came really fast.
One motor was assembled wrong, one winding wire was outside where it shouldn't be... 
Basically, the rotor was spinning against it the whole time so it broke after a week.

Then I' sent an email to Jason who owns the site and he told me I can't get a replacement motor but he can give me like 5% off... In the meantime ESC also broke and I saw a lot of people who had the same trucks broken.
So I went to the PayPal and sent him a message there... He ignored it for 2 weeks so I started a dispute, exactly the other day he offered me 80 USD but that wasn't much compared to the full price so i refused it. 
Then PayPal offered me a full refund but I had to ship everything back and the shipping would be around 90 USD, that was too much and I didn't find any way to contact them without calling them on phone, I didn't because they don't have an office in my country and English isn't my first language. So I contacted him again  on email... We were talking for a few days and in the end he offered me 100 USD and i accepted it. That was the beginning of the month and there were some holidays in china so he told me to wait till 8th and then hi will refund me 100 USD. He also told me to close the dispute and and that was before he told me about the holidays btw. I was so stupid because I didn't know that once you close the dispute, PayPal can't reopen it again.
So i did...

A week later I asked him can I get my money now and he replied;

"our accoutant will operate the refund later today, we just resume office operation today. many work to follow up, please give us some time."

And I said okay no problem.

A day later I sent an email again asking whats going on and he said to give him some hours because he was at maker fare at the moment.

A day later he said I'll get my money by Monday or Tuesday and that was Friday btw.

At Monday I sill didn't receive anything so I sent an email again,
At Tuesday I asked something like; "So it has to be today right?", no reply
A day after I send an email again, and again and again. No reply.

Then I asked my friend to send him an email with a question about the ESCs and he replied instantly.

Then I finally called PayPal and they told me to **NEVER CLOSE A DISPUTE UNTIL I GET THE MONEY**.

They couldn't reopen it because 5 days passed since I closed it. 

I cant get it... How can he just get away with it like that? The total amount was 357 USD... 
That's a lot of money...

Edit: PayPal won't get my money back because I closed the dispute and now they have nothing do to with it anymore.

Those cheaper boards never turn out being cheap cause there's always issues like this. 

I'd say call it a hard lesson learned and don't buy from them. Support our local vendors they give high quality parts and stake their reputation on their products.

By closing it, you gave them a free pass to not spend any more money resolving it for you.  Just consider it an expensive lesson learned and you are better now because of it.  You spent that money upgrading yourself, now for the skateboard...

Buy another one of everything and do a chargeback on that. Play fire with fire. 

Or take the high road and learn this be an expensive lesson... Never buy anything through paypal without your credit card. 

I have never had paypal help me resolve anything. I usually do a chargeback to my card and let my bank deal with paypal

I have told countless people not to do business with diyeboards as there stuff is junk and they are basically as scammy as alextech or willpark or mboards or the 20 other scammers that have taken peoples money without anything to show for it.  You should always buy from the guys who people trust there is a thread about it.  Unfortunately I dont think there is much you can do now that it is closed because closing it tells paypal that you and him settled it.  He played you like Charlie Daniels plays the fiddle.

Yes, PayPal have always been the folks to fuck me over despite their words to the contrary.  I've also heard many, many horror stories of folks who are less than 18 years old having their entire balance stolen from them by Paypal.

And this is so true.  I will transfer the balance to the bank and buy through the card, just to have an extra layer of protection from Paypal themselves.

Not to mention how they deal with vendors, their approach is harsh and in many cases a simple claim will freeze a vendors account for months on end or withhold a huge percentage of funds.

I know of many small stores that actually had to close following paypal bullshit.

Hehe I like this idea. Seriously though, this is the best option, order the same parts and wait for them to arrive, then claim they are broken and use the other broken ones as evidence. 

To some it might seem unfair, but really it’s what is expected and deserved. You cannot treat customers like this

The whole "we sell A grade/higher quality parts outside of Asia, where others sell similar looking B grade components" got old really fast.

Time and time again I asked for evidence of these differences and I told Jason explicitly evidence could help boost sales...if it were true. He never sent anything despite promising. 

That said, the same crappy parts are sold by many different resellers, some of them located in Europe and the US. Watch our for rebranded parts (motors, trucks, escs). Typically the same quality, but after sales is where you will often notice a difference.

Now I just want to start riding my board again... I was looking at these racerstar motors that would fit on the truck

https://www.banggood.com/Racerstar-5045-BRH5045-200KV-6-12S-Brushless-Motor-For-Balancing-Scooter-p-1117661.html?rmmds=search&cur_warehouse=CN

They are not that expensive and in the future I would for sure upgrade to original caliber II trucks, Dicky Ho cnc motor mounts etc. 

What do you think? I heard racerstar is ok and I mean, every drone builder has used them

They are perfect because they have the d shaped shaft that would fit the pullies I got, they have sensors and it would all fit as is

Get the racerstar 140kv 5065 motors from banggood, those are pretty decent considering their price.  They're the same motor Evole uses, except they have them wound at 150kv.  I would not get the 200kv version because you can always reduce the number of teeth on the wheel pulley if needed.  It's hard to go the other way, though.  Plus 140kv won't overshoot your erpm limits on your controller.

Seems like you haven't learned your lesson. Stop buying the cheap stuff or at least research the parts you are about to buy. The flipsky motors have well documented issues. The reseller offers similar warranty as diyeboard, send the items back to Shenzhen if it breaks..or get offered 40 %off on your next purchase, etc.

A good use of the search buttons equals getting a good shopping list for parts. Hobbyking motors are cheap but relatively reliable compared to some other brands, including much more expensive sealed motors sold by trusted resellers.

Yeah but I want to get 5045 because they would fit this mounts and trucks... But if they are not worth it I won't

Also, later when i get more money I would get original caliber trucks and other mounts... I just want to ride again that's why I was looking at racerstar 5054's

I use the 5045 on caliber trucks too.  I have not put the 5045 to hill test yet.   I had the 5065 on back and front set up and it was great.  It went up very 19grade hills without any problem.   

Make sure your motor mounts take the racerstar motors.  They are not the normal 50 and 63mm motor hole patterns.    I have to made my own motor mounts.   Racerstar motors does not fit dickyho mount.

I took some meassurements and with what they have on the site, the holes are spaced equal to the other 50-- motors i have...

Maybe the 63-- motors have different holes

 But If they are ok then I'll use them on this mounts and trucks and later I would upgrade to better stuff with same motors

For your reference, 
there’s possibility other chinese market places will do this kind of cheat. 

“The products are ready to send. So close dispute in paypal please, then we’ll send them after closing ”.  

I experienced this at “Gearbest” gearbest.com mall of Chinese big company that sells various electronic products, and that is one of the biggest  market places of China. The company has some other market places and has over 5000 employees. Gearbest’s sales is 860M USD in 2017, incomparable with diyeboard, I guess. https://ecommercedb.com/en/store/gearbest.com

Paypal staff told me, when seller send valid tracking number to paypal, the status of dispute will be changed automatically by paypal. So closing dispute by buyer isn’t needed.

I had an issues with PayPal once. I got them on the phone and said in short to a supervisor after bitching my way there something along the lines of.

"I've been a PayPal account holder for 13 years, just downloaded my entire transaction history. I've had $203k pass through this account paying for goods, in that time I have raised 16 disputes, totalling $883. 13 of those disputes we're cancelled as me and the seller worked it out. Leaving a total of $247 in claims that you have had to cover and pay me for 3 claims over 13 years, and over 6000 transactions. My current dispute is for $83 dollars, and you want to deny that claim. I'll wait while you confirm everything I just said. Now you can either fix this because I'm honest, or you can loose a customer."

They fixed it. And I haven't had to argue another claim since.

Yes, and of course not all customers experienced. It’s only my experience. And we can’t know rate of this kind of cheat. 

Some people reported “don’t buy evolve!” because of remote connection issues and attitude of customer support service, for example. And some people say “unsatisfied customers tend to report issues than satisfied customers. That makes sense. But we can’t know the real rate of faulty product. 

And when I check posts about boosted on Reddit, I feel there’re so many people who experienced bending issue of motor shaft and horrible customer service about 3rd Generation Boosted. But we can’t know the real rate of faulty product.

Makes me sick every time I read something like this. If there was anything we could do as a group I would love to help. What if we all signed up to send an email all at once. Everyone who joins in can all send an email saying “if you don’t refund him we are no longer using your business”. Maybe it’s a stupid idea but it would certainly get their attention. I’ve bought two ESCs that have broken from them. Mostly because of the size. I won’t consider using them again if this doesn’t get resolved.

Just to add a little balance to this thread : 

For my son's budget board I've ordered three times from diyeboard in last two months. All paid with PayPal, all arrived in UK within 10 days. Zero issues.

Not saying there aren't problems for others, but this is my experience.

Sure the site is proper budget kit, but it's for light use and to serve as introduction to esk8 for him before I let him loose on my main board....

I'm one of the most patient and polite persons I know and experienced the "customer service" first hand. The shitty ESC just gave up driving one of their hub motors, the connectors went loose and melted from the sparks and I never heard anything after an assurance that the technicians will have a look at my footage. My polite reminder email was never answered. Since the fsesc 4.12 came out I have no reason to deal with him any more. After this I believed every bad feedback in this forum to be 100% true.

Exactly the ESCs are shitty and call apart. I actually haven’t had “rudeness” in my interactions with the customer service. There’s just no effort to help or fix the issues. I had the same thing happen, they ask for a video and then won’t respond. After I sent a few more emails I got a reply “the esc is broken because you mounted it with silicone glue (around the edge of the esc). When I came up with reasons that didn’t make sense it was oh then check to make sure your wires are in the right order. !!! This has worked for months and then stopped it’s not the wire order. So after I questioned this logic (in nice words btw) they just started ignoring my emails.

Entitled? Jason/diyeboard's strategy is to slam a customer who reports an issue with a multitude of unnecessary requests to resolve the issue. ESC problem? Standard reply is to state that the user is simply not pairing the remote correctly, though from previous forwarded video it should be obvious that pairing is not the cause of the issue. Then after an x amount of videos has been sent by the customer, diyeboard suddenly requires several email reminders to process the warranty claim until you hear nothing. You have to contact them via multiple channels to get a reply. Most people just give up after that and order a good alternative product somewhere else. It's a good strategy that works. 

Then the excuses. It's a Chinese holiday, we have a backlog of orders to process, be patient, etc.

Sure, you will have the occasional customer who won the lottery and has had a good experience...those people will come in and defend diyeboard. Mission succeeded.

I agree, but you have to admit that this is probably not the first time that you hear of something like this happening? They should at least have the ability to reopen a dispute if there is no evidence that it has been resolved? Normally they require the party in question to send some Form of proof to close one down.

It's a bit of topic but it's the same with them freezing large sums of money's on vendors accounts, and then telling them it will be available again as soon as one month or up to a year after being granted back to them.

Jason scammed me too. DIYEBOARD stole $874 USD from me - no product received! DO NOT BUY FROM THEM. I made an order for $874 (36" dual motor + PU wheels) and then I had to cancel the same day for personal financial reasons. Jason said a refund WAS acceptable and said it was "processing". I contacted him a few days after and he made up some excused "the accountant is off duty" but don't worry its "processing paypal needs some time"

I checked my Credit Card statements- I never received the refund.

I've emailed him numerous times replying to the email chain where he said refund was on its way but  **NO RESPONSE** . I've tried all his emails, and contact through the website but  **NO RESPONSE.**

I emailed him the other day from another email I used and he responded within 20mins. Upon giving him my order number waiting for a refund he  **IGNORED IT.**

**Jason Volans is a thief and has stolen $874 USD from me** . I have received NO PRODUCT and NO REFUND. I can't believe this is how someone runs a business.

I'm trying to raise awareness of this hopefully it doesn't happen to anyone else, if you choose to purchase from DIYEBOARD you are just  **gambling your money** . Any other source for parts would be better- ebay, aliexpress etc.

The majority of people that buy from them probably never read that and even then the cheap price is always a pro that outways every con to them.

I was just answering your question, I don't require that you like the answer so arguing with me about it is a wasted effort.

If its to good of a deal to be true, then it probably is.

everything you see here (apart from decks and shredder trucks) came from diyeboard. 5x seperate orders over time, no last minute changes or requests, just picked what I wanted, paid with PayPal sat back and waited. 2 - 4 weeks later each time the stuff arrives with no issue. Tracking numbers supplied each time, sales confirmation emails received each time.

I hear and read lots of negativity about this site, and there does seem to be a witch hunt against Jason for one reason or another, but I honestly don't see what the issue is. These two boards are unashamedly budget affairs, build to serve as an introduction to esk8 for my son and his mate, but everything works as described and nobody 'stole' any money from me.

The internet is great for reviews, and the people who have bad experiences always type the loudest, but I'm all for balance and fairness. In this instance I feel it necessary to explain that diyeboard is NOT a scammer site, and DOES supply goods and services as described. I'm sure there are some customers who've had a mix up with their orders, or some who have had stuff break, or some who've changed their order after placing and paying for it only to suffer delays whilst it gets sorted or refunded... but that is the same for any company at any price point.

I don't expect these boards to last forever, nor break any records, but for $400 or so each they represent good value (for what they are). Light use only, beginner/learner boards.

Wait a second... 

I'm glad you didn't have any issues with this vendor, but that doesn't prove that he is not a scammer. Even alextech probably had customers that received their stuff and were happy. Was he not a scammer?

What's even more important though is how this Jason handles customers when or if there are issues, and when running a business, there WILL be issues, no exceptions to this fact. Even the trusted and most liked vendors will eventually run into some sort of issues with customers. It's part of running a business that deals with selling products. 

But, what separates Jason from most other vendors is that when he had an issue with a customer, he went on to this forum and posted name, address and all credit card details of the cc owner (who, according to Jason, wasn't even the buyer himself, as the buyer had used his wife's (or relatives) cc) !

I don't care how many happy customers there are. Handling happy customers is not a challenge. It's how you handle the unhappy customers that tells you a thing or two about how you run your business, if you're trustworthy or not.

I realize there are products out there delivered by diyeboard. This doesn’t change the fact that I have no product and no refund. Multiple attempts to contact him he simply ignores me. Then when I contact using different email suddenly a reply, then when he gets my order number he ignores. It’s sad that he does that, very dishonourable and terrible person. To all those who have received products good for you, just know that there is a gamble involved- next time you order you could get totally screwed.

OK some fair point(s) there. Perhaps I should have written that the site 'per sey' is not a scammer site in that it is a genuine website - that's what I meant by that statement. I had heard about the credit card postings etc, but not being privvy to exact details of how that came about I can't comment. I'm not trying to 'prove' anything.... but I have read a lot of the complaints about this company and in my experience there's usually more to a story than meets the eye. Certainly some cases have been interesting to read between the lines where it's likely that the customer was as fault too, or had unreasonably great expectations (this is not a reference to ANY person on this thread - just a general statement).

 My post was to say that, like most things, you really only ever hear about the negatives. And an angry person tends to over inflate the problems they had (again this is a general point and NOT aimed at any individual on here or elsewhere). I'm an online retailer and deal with the public on a daily basis so don't need a lesson in that. Sometimes problems arise now and then and I sort them out on the spot. Some are beyond my control and the customer gets angry (sometimes justified, other times unfairly). There just seems to be practice these days of labelling every seller who either 1) makes a mistake or 2) has mistakes made on their behalf by a courier, as a scammer. It's lazy language and usually problems are all too easy to fix internally or with the help of your Payment Provider.

I don't understand the refund issues. You can only pay for stuff with a Credit Card or PayPal, and both services protect the buyer from being 'scammed'. If the stuff doesn't turn up and the seller disputes this, you just open a Case. If the seller can't prove the items were delivered you get a refund. Sometimes a shipment leaves the warehouse before a customer cancels or changes an order. Why then should they get a refund at all. They would then have to send the stuff back as a return surely ? All I'm saying is that there's no reason why you should lose money for non delivered items if you can prove they never arrived.

Shoddy merchandise is another matter. Difficult to get your money back from China if the stuff breaks over here. You get what you pay for in that sector and in the case of diyeboard parts buyers are (or should be) aware that the stuff isn't the best or most durable. It's gonna break, so if you can't afford to lose money on broken parts, avoid cheap chinese vendors. 

That's another problem for esk8 in that it's an expensive hobby, often persued by younger people who don't have much spare cash. Blowing $800 on a skateboard for them might be the biggest single luxury purchase they make all year, and it sucks badly when that budget board breaks. $800 is nowhere near enough to build a (brand new) esk8 that's going to last and hold up to the abuse it'll receive. Managing expectations is key here too.

Bad business is bad business, one time out of a thousand or out of ten. It's the same to me, we experience delays in shipping or building batteries. The most important thing is communication with the customer.
Anyone who has been in DIY esk8 for longer than 6-month knows patience is a necessity. Things have gotten better since I started a few years ago. I still have nightmares of a certain vendors email based support? WTF, yea that's two weeks of my life ill never get back......
Stand your ground, report the facts and PP will do their job in the purchase protection portion of their extortion fee.

O, PayPal so cleverly positioned ......

Every seller is legit.....until he decides to scam people. We have had several "trusted" members here that run out with the cash.

Diyeboard has been banned from the forum for exposing personal info of their customers. Credit cards for example. I don't think that rule applies here.

A rule must be applied in all cases. 
If we start accepting exceptions and create loopholes then it is useless.

I have no interest in protecting diyeboard's interests or anyone else's for that matter.

According to the no bashing rule, we are free to state our experience with a vendor while sticking to the facts. Nothing more.

I believe most people in this forum are more than capable of making up their own minds as to whether a vendor is reliable or not.

Experiences good or bad should be documented, this is more than enough to inform other people without the unnecessary drama.

A good vendor has no need from anyone, member or moderator to defend him (as it happens from time to time) since the good experiences will win over the bad ones.

The same goes with a bad vendor, if 20 people have a bad experience with a vendor vs 3 people that had a good experience, that should be enough for someone to make up his own mind if he wants to deal with that particular vendor.

I do not like vendors being treated with a double standard and unfortunately this happens from time to time.

I almost agree. In my opinion this forum lacks rules and there's no respect at all.
My experience with diyeboard has been flawless and i have nothing to complain about yet ....
Exposing credit cards info is plain illegal that guy can't be trusted. That's a fact.
Several members have lost hundreds of dollars buying there. That's also a fact.
I think warning about this behaviour is not bashing a vendor but saving members of this forum from a disaster.
I have seen people asking for the complaint form because the ice cream was too cold.
There's no way to please every customer so no bashing vendors is a good rule but imo It does not apply here. There is a REAL shady behaviour in that site.

Could not agree with you more.
However some of the previous posts could easily be classified as bashing.
All I am saying is if I make a post about a bad experience I had about @psychotiller **_(just an example, I had nothing but great interactions with Dave_**) all you have to do is come out with your good experience.
Sooner or later I will either be outed as a prick or just an unfortunate exception to the otherwise excellent service.
No need for drama or personal attacks.
Just the facts.
