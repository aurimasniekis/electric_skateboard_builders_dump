As some of you might have noticed, I recently started distributing kits for the DAVEga gadget for a little price ($9). We've been doing the payments via PayPal and it's frustrating how expensive it gets. I mean, depending on the type of payment, the fee is somewhere between $0 and $2+, which may look negligible, but relative to the amount to be paid it's more than 20% in some cases, especially if currency conversion is involved. And 20% is a lot. It's not like we cannot afford it, but it annoys me. I thought about doing Transferwise instead, but there seems to be a minimal fee of ~$0.5, which is also not great for small transactions (though still better than PayPal). Is there a better way to do small payments?

I apologize if this is slightly off-topic.

Friends and family works, but there are catches:
- you still get charged if you pay with a credit/debit card
- if currency conversion is involved, there's also a fee and the exchange rate is ridiculous

I'm Czech and we have CZK here. I switched the default currency of my PayPal account to USD, but some incoming payments still get converted from USD to CZK. It's not clear how that happens. People say "there was no other option in my PayPal than to send it in CZK".

I guess we'll just have to go for the pigeons. :smile:

Have a look on transferwise.
Just used it once or twice but fees way much cheaper than PayPal. Idk maybe no fees at all with small amounts.

I know about Transferwise and I like them. The problem is they have a minimal transaction fee. It's very small (around $0.5), but that's still around 5% for a $9 transaction.

They are owned by PayPal. I would be surprised if there's a whole lot of a difference. Thanks for the tip though. I'll check them out.

Just send it directly to my wallet. If you need to send money to somebody, just send it to me. You can rest assured that it will be used to make me happy.

Roll up a $100 bill, stuff it up a pigeon's ass, and fly it to me. Trust me, that pigeon will want that cash transferred as efficiently as possible.

Correct, they have a cloaca. Which is a general purpose orifice for the poop/piss composite as well as eggs, and occasionally the $100 bill. Its so much better than a mere ass.

My reputation was on the line. The Ass vs Cloaca debate is an important one.

the issue here is sending money internationally.

venmo sucks for international.

so does paypal.

bitcoin, or most crypto, doesn't charge a fee.  open a free wallet at an exchange of your choice.  then people can send you coins to your wallet address.  simple.  i'd recommend etherium (classic).

I'm all for crypto, but I'm afraid it would be stopper for a lot of people since it's just too complicated to buy into crypto.

BTW, there are definitely (substantial) fees for Bitcoin transactions. That's the main reason for the Bitcoin cash (BCH) fork.

How does nano exist without even having fees?   So far seems good but maybe people are often already signed up w a service like paypal and spending the time to sign up, maybe worth the five buck fee of paypal international.  Bunch of free international it seems.

After another bad experience with PayPal today I figured there's time to update this thread.

I've been using [Revolut](https://www.revolut.com/) for a while now and IMO it's a MUCH better alternative to PayPal. You can accept payments in many currencies and the exchange rates are amazing. You can even keep balances in other currencies without converting but since converting back and forth costs almost nothing, there's not really a good reason for doing so.

Payments within Revolut are instant. Just like PayPal, except there are no fees.

I got a debit card to my Revolut account, which has cost me 99 CZK including shipping (less than 5 USD). That's all the fees I have paid so far. The card can be used for both standard and online payments. It's great for traveling because of the good exchange rates.

It comes with a nice mobile app, which keeps track of all transactions. When I make a card payment, it's a matter of seconds before I get a notification in the app. I can also instantly block the card using the app, or even allow/block certain types of transactions (online, ATM withdrawals, contactless).

You can even instantly top up your Revolut balance with a card payment. Still no fees. I don't quite understand how this works since they are certainly loosing money on this. I expect this will change in the future.

Where's the catch? I'm wondering too, but so far I haven't found any.

Cash app has worked for me with locals but there's no safety if you send money for a product cash app won't back you up if the seller becomes an a hole.

This whole concept of buyer protection seems pretty awkward to me. It's a good thing for the buyer and a bad thing for the seller. Why should the seller be put to a disadvantage? Is there a reason to believe that buyers are more honest than sellers? If I provide bad service as a seller, I risk my reputation. If as a buyer I make up reasons for a refund, I don't risk anything.

There's alot of fraud here in the US on both sides seller and buyer. These things are ment to protect both parties not just the buyer.  This type of security gives people more incentive to buy online instead of in a store.
