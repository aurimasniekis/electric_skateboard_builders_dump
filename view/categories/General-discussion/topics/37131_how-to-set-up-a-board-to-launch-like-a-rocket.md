So I have been up until now keeping it at a cool 65a motor max until I started doing some research. I realized that as long as your motors don't get too hot to the touch you really can crank it up over 100a and still be pretty safe it seems. So right now I'm sitting at 120a motor max on this setup...

12S4P dual 6374 190kv 16t/40t on 107mm flywheels

My vescs are shutting down and rebooting at around the 2-3mph mark after launching. At 100a it was fine but 120a I'm assuming at that low of a duty cycle it is pulling crazy amps and triggering this fault code...

Anyone have any suggestions on this one? I know I can mess with throttle curve or duty cycle ramping to get around this... but I really want the full 120a in my face without smoothing the acceleration out to get around it :stuck_out_tongue:

there is absolutely no way your pulling 120a

well I logged 75a just doing a light acceleration unless the data is wrong in the metr app ... whatever the true amps are I'm not concerned with. I'm just tying to solve my issue here because the vescs are restricting me.

@BigBoyToys get in here and spead them knowledges :stuck_out_tongue:

i would lower you motor a until you stop getting faults

This is motor amps, not battery amps, so since he is at a relitivly low speed the duty cycle is low meaning he's pulling a a lot of amps at a low voltage, a low wattage. His battery amps at 1mph could never get to 120 as his duty cycle would be too low.

At low duty cycle it's definitely possible to be pulling 120 motor amps. Sadly I can't help much with you problem though. In the readout is the "Current" it's refering to battery amps? If so then at 0.18 duty you'd be at 76.2/0.18 = 423A in the motor... That can't be right, can it?

If you're running FOC you could try increasing your switching frequency from 20k to 30k as it may be the vesc is not taking measurements at precise enough intervals and accidently over shooting it causing a over current error. (idk if there is something like this for BLDC) Also you could try increasing your absolute motor max setting as that is what will cause the vesc to reboot if it measures a current above that.
```

Before you try changing the frequency, try changing the absolute max value to something like 160-170. I'm assuming when you changed your motor max you left your absolute max at 130.

Now we are getting somewhere! :slight_smile:

I'm actually running in Hybrid mode because I like having still having my DRVs intact lmao. I wonder where it switches over from sensored to unsensored.... Edit**** right there is literally a value for that in the config *facepalm*

Yep left abs max at 130a and motor max cranked up to 120a

Sensored/hybrid vs unsensored are different things from BLDC vs FOC btw.

Yeah but using the hall sensors would give more precise measurements than non sensored right?

Also some other tidbits... along with abs max being set to 130 I'm have max watts unchecked and batt max at 40 (this prob can at least go to 50 right?)

Agree -- at 120A you are melting the 10 or 12 gauge wire coming into the ESC or vaporising the leads on the esc capacitors.  It's just not happening.  You might have like milliseconds where you're pulling that, but there is no way you are pulling that for more than that.  So basically, it's not going to really hurt you to turn it down, I would think.

In fact I vaporised the leads on an Evolve ESC's capacitors before, and that's only an 80A system... supposedly

I don't think hall sensors will effect preciseness of current measurements but I could be wrong, I believed they were just for a smooth startup as the vesc knows which phase to energize. Changing motor min will effect braking ability but isn't part of your over current problem.

let's not get hung up on the does it really draw that much part... all I know is it felt faster at 120 than 100 on the ol butt dyno.

BATT MAX not motor min

Still affecting braking ability. Just change your absolute motor max to 160 and try that. It should solve all your problems.

jesus I can't get it right tonight. I'm meaning to say batt max (which affects high speed side) for 12s4p you think it's plenty safe to up from 40 to 50?

I'll try upping abs max and see if that does the trick...

And esc is dead after bumping to 140 abs max. Hopped on for a 150 test and realized I only had one motor running.... 

Canâ€™t say I didnâ€™t see that coming....

Sorry im still in Hawaii on vacay.

I run 150A abs max on one of my builds and havent lost an esc in a while. Full throttle take offs from a dead stop have usually been where the problems happen the most.

If the code only happens at low dutycycle, Id suggest softening the bottom end of the throttle curve. Youll lose a little of the line but youll still have more than you did at 65A motor.

Replace that drv and try again ðŸ˜‰.

Yeah it would only happen at low duty cycle (like 2-3mph). 

I'm assuming the vesc6 would solve this almost certainly correct?

Hard to say, I run 37.5 batttery Amps per motor and 100-120A  motor amps per motor on my 4wd's and have never seen that code on FOC box's.

But DD and on top of that 4wd isn't a fair comparison is it? Also do you leave max amps unchecked or is it limited?

I've never been able to get it to launch like a rocket (the way i would like) and not reset at least one of the vesc based ESCs during or immediately after the hard acceleration part.

I'm running 80a per motor in FOC with dual 6355s with a vesc6, and it doesn't stutter, doesn't jerk, doesn't anything. SUUUPER smooth. I can't stay on it with a full throttle pull unless I'm sitting on the board.

Turns out the vesc somehow reset settings and I didnâ€™t kill the drv. 

Went back in and we are back at it. Hereâ€™s a log of messing around without launching. 

Hit 97.5a motor at 18mph..... so itâ€™s definitly getting up there.
