There are a couple "Who's where?"/Introduction threads floating around, but I like the thread @Michaelinvegas started for USA peoples.

Are there even enough of us Canadians out there to warrant our own thread? Let's see some Canadian love.

_Winnipeg, Manitoba here._

(I feel like we don't even need to list provinces.) :blush:

Anyone in the Toronto/GTA area want to buy this lot of 2 boards with me ? 

http://www.ebay.ca/itm/LOT-of-2-Longboard-freeride-quality-skateboard-9-25-x-34-SLIDE-CHANNEL-D02-/252709338301?hash=item3ad6a67cbd:g:umEAAOSw44BYbKMZ

When you buy 2, the cost per board is $70.22 CAD shipped, but if you buy the single board its $107.51 shipped. Let me know if you're interested.

also single board if anyone's interested:

Hopefully we get a mild dry winter unlike the predictions are saying.

Mostly from the US. I picked up 15mm pulleys from johnny_261 and focbox's from JohnnyMeduse. Both in 🇨🇦. Other parts are mostly US and EU. Either way I avoid cheesy ebay parts at all costs. I'd rather buy once.

Hey man, welcome to Edmonton! Late i know. 
Downtown isn't the best place but there's trails around there along the river valley that are smooth and paved and quite satisfying to ride! 
I think we should get a group ride together here soon. @Wolfcola has one organized through the meet up app.
