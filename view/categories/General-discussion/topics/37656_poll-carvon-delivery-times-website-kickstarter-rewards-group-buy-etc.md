Since the information about delivery times I am getting from Carvon is less than abundant, I am turning it upside down and ask customers, as me (Kickstarter backer) about who got what product after what kind of wait duration.

I don*t mean any harm to anyone or to rain on anybody's parade, BUT (there's always a big but) the facts are

1. The EVO 2WD was supposed to ship in July

1. There have been setbacks in the availability of parts that account for some delay (I get that)

1. Lately more and more new products are being sold without having shipped the old ones

Also the updates on Kickstarter and especially the answers to backers' questions have become fewer and elusive. I asked for an updated plan for delivery of the Kickstarter rewards, for example, and they did not answer at all.

I would be content to know that, let's say they plan to ship in January or so, and that the reason for the additional delay is X.

But I don't have that information.

So please let me know, if you will, what is your experience with Carvon so far?
Did you get you reward or ordered product in the expected time frame?

BTW: If that did not come across clearly. I am very fond of the products Carvon produces and cannot wait to get my feet on a board with direct drives. That's why I backed them in the first place.

I ordered v4 on August 9, was told they'd ship in 3-4 weeks. After multiple emails and DM on IG with no answer, the only way that I got an answer was when I replied to a post on IG. I guess you have to make it public to get a reply. And I just settled for v3 coz I didn't wanna wait anymore. Got them on November 2. 
Actually messaged him to cancel my order. But he never replied until he already sent them. So, I ended up keeping them.

Ordered v3 speed drives on the Kickstarter and got them late August.
I was fine with the delay because he ended up making upgrades to the design.

Dude your concerns are totally valid and I‚Äôm sure there are many here biting thier tongues right now that wanna chime in but are trying to be nice....lol 

And too ‚Äúabsolutely‚Äù make excuses for Jerry lol This ain‚Äôt easy trying to design something that will work as intended and will last you.

Let‚Äôs go to the video tape
üëáüèª

https://youtu.be/_v5KxIQqc8w

This was the first EVO. Check out the Drive System.

Now notice the drive system currently offered that‚Äôs used on the EVO Definitely not the same design.
üëáüèª  

https://youtu.be/4TJVzRnBuek


Add the tweeking of the adapter to accept Abec11 and clones 

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/e/8/e87d9fdccbd977b774a5945970d98f82b17f6de2.jpeg" width="281" height="500">

It definitely takes time to design it. It takes time to ensure that all the parts work as intended so that you guys aren‚Äôt turned into beta testers. He doesn‚Äôt want to recall Carvon Drive systems because of an issue like a broken axle or wheels falling off. So, he‚Äôll take the heat for being slow to deliver if it means you get system that lives up to the hype.  Plain and simple. 

So, I guess the less than stellar delivery times, is an unfortunate byproduct of Carvon taking it slow and steady to avoid the issues and problems of other crowd funded projects Esk8 and non-Esk8 alike. This is a very small community. People can forgive waiting as long as the end product meets or beats expectations.

For those that have purchased a Carvon product and are still waiting....Do you still believe and feel the same abt Carvon now as you did when you first clicked on the buy button or sent funds? If the answer is yes....then hang in there...if you paid...you‚Äôll get your Carve On soon. If no...I‚Äôm sure there is some willing to take them off your hands.

Waiting sucks. But it‚Äôs worth the wait.

And to back up his shit up...Jerry has agreed to refund anyone that don‚Äôt wanna wait (even the Kickstarter people way back) just let him know. No harm. No foul. He wants you guys to shred, but if waiting is a hitch in your plans. Let him know. 

He‚Äôs doing his very best not to let anyone down. And it‚Äôs a tough situation to be in when people want thier stuff and the parts are not ready for various reasons because really shit happens and it‚Äôs the customer that pays for it by waiting longer.  

We‚Äôve seen this issue with pretty much every small builder or company.and issues are discussed here in comparison to larger more established Esk8 companies https://www.reddit.com/r/ElectricSkateboards/comments/76amk3/diy_companies_lhbollincarvonetc_vs_the_big/?st=J9QJ0ZRK&sh=3d9d6b37

So, to wait or not to wait? That‚Äôs a great question. How badly do you wanna feel the Carvon difference? I dunno? Is the hype real? It‚Äôs up to you guys to answer that.

i would like to say, i 100% agree new technology and at one point or another those companies such as "boosted" or evolve were once in the shoes of Jerry,small company trying to fulfill orders and expand there company.Now a days its a lot harder to grow with all these cheap companies,and misinformation of the market to new people. I rather wait and know that there is 0 possibility of failure knowing the product is ready.Big companies have had mess ups before such as boosted with there batteries or evolve with there bms's or batter packs as well.You kinda know what your getting when it comes to kick starter he is trying his best.

Yes and No. Expectations are made with dates. And that‚Äôs the problem. Miss it and there are people with pitch forks waiting...we‚Äôve seen it in various forms. The understanding goes away, and people get upset. All understandable, yes and no. The consumers now expect a listed item to be in stock and available. We in the DIY world have a better understanding of how this all works. The average person doesn‚Äôt. And it‚Äôs something you cant teach or tell them so they truly understand, they need to experience it for themselves to fully comprehend the insanity of it all.

I backed the V3 on kickstarter whenever that was and received my drive mid September. It was a long wait but well worth it. That first ride was breathtaking. 

I just turned 38 recently and have noticed that in the past 15 years people have definitely gotten less and less patient and scream for instant gratification and I'm guilty of that as well. You just have to remember Carvon is a small business that's aiming for top notch products. That needs time. Many esk8 companies over promise and under deliver. Jerry is definitely promising and delivering the quality but time is hard to predict as these are not assembled by an endless row of low wage Chinese workers but in the states by...a few? Just Jerry? Idk

Been on the esk8 diy scene for awhile I understand that shit happens, but at least let people know what's happening. it can't be difficult to give an update on what's going on. Specially when he has a new promotional post everyday.
And in my case, he said he was just waiting for the adapters for non abec11 wheels. Something that I didn't even want/need. 
It's just frustrating for some of us who doesn't have a lot of time to enjoy riding. Especially winter is coming.

Yep. Can you imagine? 

Hence the enlistment of @longhairedboy and @psychotiller on the builds.

He‚Äôs trying to get to a point where he‚Äôs firing on all cylinders. And essentially by yourself, it‚Äôs almost impossible.  Hence, you see me here in his absence.

There‚Äôs a question of non-delivered goods and new products coming out...yeah it‚Äôs obviously confusing...making people wonder...where‚Äôs my shit? And why is he selling different stuff? Then it becomes, I want the new stuff...he honors it...he tries to bump people up to something better....of course with the cost of waiting. 

All I can say is....Be glad he‚Äôs engineering new products and not trying to fix problems on current products. Chew on that for a minute.

Orederd the V3 among the first ( not even on kickstarter but on their website before the KS was live ) and recieved them mid september. 
Was supposed to ship in May. 
The wait was worth it. Carvon is the best drive in the industry.

Awesome offer and no doubt he‚Äôd take you up on it. But would be better if we could round up more support for the EXO

https://carvonskates.com/products/carvon-exo-only-749-right-now

Hands on deck is awesome, but orders are really what makes the wheels go round. The rest would take care of its self once orders and money come in. It would allow him to hire the needed help and other things that make the purchase to delivery time quicker.

The DIY community in general, respects the Carvon product, I think. It‚Äôs unattainable for many because of its higher price point and unconventional design. We are a small community. In the EXO, Jerry is offering an affordable taste of what Carvon DIYers and Owners have known all along, but had to pay a premium to obtain. And progressing on the EXO would help bolster Carvon and insures  continued development of new products and support of old ones.

Unless he's been testing these for a while (at least a year), you can't eliminate this risk.

It takes time for parts to get made and things to get assembled, which I believe is more likely the reason people are waiting. It's the reason we haven't shipped motors either. Machining companies will tell you this day, and blow past that date. We still don't have the samples we we're suppose to have 3 weeks ago. Every factory we have worked with blows past their delivery dates with little concern. We always get the parts in the end, but they always struggle to get things on time. Don't know why I had a feeling this time would be different, and it's likely an issue for carvon, as it has been for enertion too.

Has anyone done a video review of the EXO vs. other boards in its price range? And of course vs. Boosted and Evole for good measure? If I hadn't gotten sucked into the V4SDXL vortex, I might have gotten an EXO just because it looks like such a solid board, especially for $700-800. Seems like a viral review video spread around Reddit, Facebook, Boosted & Evole forums would open a lot of people's eyes.

Totally agree with you on this, more hype and better videos are needed to get people aware and onboard.

I‚Äôm new to all this and I backed the EXO campaign as my first electric board. It took a bit of finding. I became interested after trying a Boosted v2 for 5mins, I was hooked but couldn‚Äôt stump up ¬£1500. I wanted the best board I could find for under ¬£800. 

I went through loads of video reviews and forums (including this one) to find a good value board. The name Carvon kept coming up and I eventually found the Indiegogo page. A couple of emails and further Carvon talk on here and I pulled the trigger.

Now I‚Äôm really surprised that only one more has been taken since I gave my money last Sunday?

How many EXO‚Äôs are there in prototype, can someone do a good review / comparison and upload, it would have really helped me make the decision faster and with more confidence.

@DilatedPupils Did you get the progress update email today?

For those who are not in the KS circle, Here's the latest news (#32) from CarvOn:

**Posted by CARVON LLC (Creator)
Hey guys, sorry for the long absence. The design of the V4 has proven to be a real challenge. 
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/6/8/681ae84dd95209210ec22316c9a852d5cb3d68f4.jpg" width="690" height="388">**V4 SpeedDrive with Replaceable Wheel Inserts**

This is going to be the final design of the V4. We are very confident in it that we have ordered hundreds of them already. 

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/e/3/e300d16342bf1d36279af677873261e46d47dd2c.jpg" width="690" height="388">**V3 to V4 Iterations**

The leap from V3 to V4 was surprisingly difficult for us. We wanted a non-screw attachment for the V4, much like the one for the V3. We originally used our gear-like V2.# motor cap but the holes in them deformed the wheel inserts because of the heat from inside the motors. We removed the holes, but found that the molds for the wheel inserts will be too expensive because of the complex gear design. Eventually, we opted for threaded holes and a simpler design. But we still had to make some precise re-calibration of the dimensions, just to make sure the V4s and the wheels will fit on the axle.

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/c/6/c6dceefc53f21d4cbae4d96ef7b3b1fb74761472.jpg" width="390" height="500">
**Magnet Ring**

We have also included a magnet ring to help keep the magnets in place. The next step for us to do is to have hundreds of the plastic wheel inserts done. Then we can finally wrap up the V4 saga.

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/6/9/6964eff1c8c75835b4984382d2e0ae181343d606.jpg" width="690" height="361">**V4 SpeedDrive XL**

Because of this, we have incurred higher than expected expenses. So we have decided to be more aggressive in selling on our website, including introducing the V4 SpeedDrive XL which is longer and has more torque (85kv vs. the 110kv of the original). The XL is the same motor as our much-loved V2.5, and now even better cause it comes with sensors.
   
We truly apologize for the very long time of getting your rewards. We do want to make sure that what you get has been designed properly and fully tested. Nevertheless, we do understand that for some people, it's a bit too long and something personal may have come up. So we do want to remind you guys that you can approach us and ask for a refund. What we are doing, including you guys, our valuable backers, is re-defining the future drive-system of Electric Skateboards/Longboards. We are all pioneers, and we hope that you stay stoked!

Thanks,
CARVON Team

I would love to jump on the Exo train, but Jerry is a busy man and I have a lot of questions he is yet to answer through email. If he can't take the time to answer questions to a potential costumer, I'm not sure if he'd be good with communicating once the incentive of me giving him money is gone...

@Michaelinvegas, if you could get in touch with him, I would if he answered my questions through email. That will decide whether or not I get the Exo

I get that but when then maybe he should focus on putting more information about the board on the website. 

Questions I have are the following:

**What cells is he using in the EXO?**
Specs show 5.5Ah and he responded in an email that he uses samsung 18650s. But I know of zero cells that have 2750mAh and there are definitely zero cells with 5500mAh

**What ESC is he using?**
In an email he responded that it is not a VESC but that it behaves just like FOC on VESC and that it **could be** a clone of VESC. So is it, or is it not? Wouldn't he know what ESC he is using and whether it is based on VESC 4.1x, VESC 6.x, or something entirely different? 

**How much would it cost to get an EXO with the SD XL drive**
This is my main question. Can I get the EXO with the SD XL motors? If so, would it cost the same, if not then what is the proce difference?
He responded that I should jump on the EXO as the price will increase soon but did not answer whether I can get the SD XL on it and if so how much it would cost. 

Not terribly hard questions to answer. It could all be written in the website but the info there is somewhat vague.

I can't wait to try out Carvon's as the only chance I got was on a single V2.5 when Michael came for an unfortunately short group ride here in SF. Can't decide between the V4 SD vs XL, but bought an XL just in case. :wink:

When I talked to Jerry a few weeks ago. What he was looking for was somebody to work on the communications part. He is just unable to respond to emails and direct messages from the forum because he‚Äôs got his hands full on machinery. 

I have tried to be helpful to him and relaying messages for some of you but taking on the responsibility of emails would be hard given my actual job and family.

If he can get back to me I‚Äôd be happy to offer help on that area if he needs someone answering emails though I am currently in a different time zone as He is I can help him out between my job and downtime. :smile:

@MrHappy sent an email hours ago but I can send another one now. What email should I use? Or do I stick with the info@carvonskates.com?

That would mean he has to actually keep in touch with you and given that he cant do that with people within a half hour drive. I find it highly unlikely it would be of any benefit to anyone

Yeah I figured that would be the case indeed. Not being able reach him even in the same state appears to be difficult lol. Well I‚Äôm still open to it if he ever need another hand but yeah he has to be able to get his communications through with his existing customers first

No... I think the only 4wd that have been send was for someone who paid the full actual  price, not from kickstarter campaign..It looks like the priority are on EXO from indiegogo and XL drive at the moment. I hope he is gratefull for our patience at least, long time we didn't get any update on the campaign.

Yes. I saw the video with the 4wd. If he starts with building the indiegogo campaign we have still monthes to wait... He probably started with providing the full prices builds because he needs money to go. I hope the situation will improve 

I perfectly understand he is too busy to reply all requests but short messages like "i am ok. Don't worry. Things are improving and all orders will be fulfilled. Thanks for your support and patience" on the KS campain update channel would be quick and easy. And relieves our concerns with the global Carvon health... 

Jerry is an awesome engineer/builder, but he is not as good in terms of organising or communicating... I noticed that since my first v1 orders :) 

Let's cross fingers and hope he will make it

"He needs money to go"..worries me. What happened to money from KS backers sent 18 months ago?

Just my hypothesis. Jerry seems still to be working hard on the project. Wait and wait...

[/quote]

As with most KS and IGG fundings, they are used to pay Chinese factories for their minimum order requirements before they produce parts for you especially for the lower cost ones that require a very large order. So most of the time, the creators of these projects are not taking the money to buy themselves anything extravagant, backers are basically investors who is willing to take the risk. Jerry assembles motor parts that are made in Chinese factories along with truck parts made in the US.

@pierres I just saw Jerry today when I went to Psychotiller's place. Still alive and kicking. Three EXO boards should be out the door soon.

Have you received your motors yet?  I can't imagine waiting 10 months. I paid $3000 for a EVO 4WD. It would be crazy to expect them to send someone a board then accept payment installments over 10 months. But that's basically what they're doing with these unreasonable delays. They advertise a 3-5 week build time on their site.  If they know they are this backed up why not be upfront? To add insult to injury they don't respond to emails! WTF! I'm giving them a week for product or refund. If not I‚Äôm filing a fraud claim with my credit card company and PayPal. Life's too short and theres other options

I received my SD-XL on October 22nd. 10 months late and 11 months and 3 weeks after placing the order (50 weeks to the day from placing an order to having a product). 

I recommend you file a charge back as soon as possible if you are not willing to wait the ridiculous delays without communication.

Reading through the thread, I am so glad I didn't waste any more money on an EXO. Saved myself a lot of anguish there.
