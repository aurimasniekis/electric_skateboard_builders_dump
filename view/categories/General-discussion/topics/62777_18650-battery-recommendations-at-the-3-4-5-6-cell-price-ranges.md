Thread for discussing experiences with 18650 batteries at different price ranges.

What are your best/worst experiences with 18650 cells at 3, 4, 5, 6+ dollar/cell price ranges?
What performance differences do you see as you go up each tier in cell price?
What cell recommendations do you have at each of these cost tiers for those planning out their budgets?

Best Sony konion vtc5
Best performance/density Sony konion vtc6
Best quality/price Samsung 30q
All of that could change tomorrow, there's a new generation of cells on the way.

This is good to know if you are deciding between vtc6 and 30q: https://www.e-cigarette-forum.com/threads/bench-test-results-which-lasts-longer-vtc6-30q-or-hg2.807131/
https://lygte-info.dk and mooch are the best sources i know of for battery tests.

lygte-info.dk was pretty comprehensive, especially https://lygte-info.dk/review/batteries2012/Common18650Summary%20UK.html

The url says 2012 though, so I'm sure there are many other improved options that have come out since then.

The 20700/21700 list was updated last year:

I would buy what is available in your region, 30q if you want value and sanyo 20700b if you want the best density i guess...
But it is not worth it in my opinion to go with the sanyo 20700b, the price increasement is just huge compared to the approx. 5% volume density gained.
check yourself if the difference is worth it for you:
30q eu price: 3.95€
sanyo 20700b eu price: 6,45€

Dont mean to hijack this thread but came across 20, 20r [cells](https://www.imrbatteries.com/samsung-20r-18650-2000mah-22a-flat-top-battery/) for pretty much free and though to why not use them.

what would be an optimal setup for these batteries. 
Have never done a 18650 pack but have read a fair amount. 

I am using one VESC and pulling no more then 25 amps from the battery with the motor max at 40 amps. 

the motor is the tancon 245kv. 

I am around 145lbs (65kg) 

I currenlty have a 6s lipo battery 5000mah. 

Should I try a 5s4p or get more voltage and go for a 10s2p?  I understand that I would get more range with a 5s4p setup but would get 21v. Im guessing the higher voltage just reduces the amount of amps needed? 

If I go with a 10s2p I have 42 volts and less range a 4000mah but I would need less amps? so then I would drain the battery slower using less amps. 

Please correct my knowledge and feel free to comment. 

Thanks
```

What do you seek ? Based on power need + range need + battery size (P count).

Roughly summarized : 
- In 18650 format -
high density low discharge (10a / cell max) : **Panasonic NCR18650GA 3500mah**
best all rounder used here (20a / cell max) : **Samsung 30Q 3000mah**
high pack voltage and high discharge capable but shit temperatures (push above 90 degrees above 25A/cell) : **Sony VTC5A 2500mah and VTC6 3100mah**
coolest and highest discharging 18650 but low cap (30A / cell below 75 degrees) : **LG HB2 1500 mah**

- In 21700 format -
expensive but nice all rounder (30a/cell + high cap) : **Samsung 40T**
expensive but great high discharge and pack voltage (40a / cell) : **Samsung 30T**

And I live the rest to you guys :v:

From theory you won´t get more range from one or the other.
In both cases you have 20 cells, which lead to 216 Wh, which lead to the same range.
In case you´re running a vesc, take the 10s option and you will run on much better efficiency than on a 5s (too low voltage for our esk8 stuff).

@rojitor  To what are u referring saying new generation of cells?

 Do u mean different chemistry or just the size / material ratio? (Like 20 / 21 size cells)

New anodes, new chemistry...
Samsung has patented (not released) new cells. There's a lot of new chemistry cells out there waiting for the chance to hit the market.
This kind of changes are slow. Even tho there's many new faster, safer and better cells invented It is really difficult to change the game. I think the new generation of Samsung is gonna happen soon. I am not sure about the rest.
