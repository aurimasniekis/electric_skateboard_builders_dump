Hi guys, had a check but couldn't find anything here already, but I thought it would be good to have a thread where people could contribute to find the best parts at the cheapest prices...

Looking initially at branded or known parts, but we can still add multiple sources for each 'type' of part as well.

I'll start off :smiley: I'm only doing the UK/EU at first, maybe a Canadian or American can do a separate thread or we can separate this one?

[/quote]

The second one listed for ebay is NOT a 63mm motor mount.  I bought that mount and ended up having to mod it to make it work and eventually just tossed it.

For Maytech thumb remote please add 

http://www.michobby.com/product-category/electric-skateboard/electric-skateboard-remote-control/ 

I have used them and got it delivered to UK within few days ( got their Vesc also! )

Link has bundles to save money but also you can get single item if you want ( scroll the pages ).

Didn't pay any custom charges and service was swift and easy.

Recommended !

Nickel strip bought from SuPower (aliexpress) is listed as Pure Ni plate. However description says pure nickel strip >99.7%. My corrosion test in salty water 24hrs after heavy scratching shows zero corrosion, so I guess this could be legit as well. <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/a/5/a56acb336a7f18083aa20832876a71cb0223c79e.jpeg" width="690" height="439">

I just stumbled across this. Not sure if it's new or not. I believe they only sold nickel strips that were pre cut before? 

Anyways, nkon sells pure nickel strip by the meter at a pretty good price. 0.15 x 10mm x 10m = 15 EUR + shipping. If you're getting your batteries from here this might be a good option. Did anyone use these strips yet?
