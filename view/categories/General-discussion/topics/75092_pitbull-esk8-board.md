All good man.  Its complicated this vendor stuff.  Shouldn't be but it is.  One bad customer with a complaint can cause major issues with a fledgling business.  Thats why the vendor rules apply.  If it turns out the guy is truly screwing people over then we will be the first to know.

I have already PM’d the OP, my direct cell phone is on my website, as well as in every email I send out. 

I’m not sure, but i think this is a customer that ordered a board which was sent out to him, and then returned to me last Wednesday. It took a few days to find out why it was returned. A new shipment has already been arranged for pick up tomorrow. If this is that customer, i do not understand why he would post on here as I have been in communication with him and he has my cell phone number.

This is all very puzzling.

Yeah.... I saw your number on your website and the only reason I though he would be posting here is if you weren’t answering your phone. Who knows :man_shrugging:

Also, if you don’t want to post you cell number but still have a contact number on your website in the future, try SmartLine from godaddy to create a second phone number you can manage via an app. I use it for another small business and it works great!

I was seriously considering adding to the listing a statement limiting battery sales to the US. We can ship internationally, however it does get a but pricy and will counter some of the discount.

I’ll get some examples of shipping costs. What country are you in?

I believe they were going for a little over $100 each, so no, not cheap. But I'm sure theirs customers out there who will pay for it!

I don't know if anyone has posted about this, but I have indeed received my battery from Pitbull about a week ago and it's great quality any works well. Chis' costumer support was great for me and he was always trying to do the best thing for the customer for me. Give him a little more patience as you have to remember all of his products are hand-made and he probably has an abundance of orders from Black Friday and the holidays (Also shipping batteries isn't the easiest thing). Hopefully you receive your board soon, but Chris does run a legit company. Good luck.

[/quote]

Uh... yes it is easy. It's only hard to accomplish when you don't have the batteries in the first place. How many batteries have you shipped? I've shipped 6 personally. It was cheap and easy. It only takes one extra sticker for caution and always use ground shipping. Nice captain save a hoe dude. ;)

It's a step in the right direction, thanks for the update. 

Maybe check back in with us in a few weeks? I don't mean to sound as though I expect the parts to break, but generally if something goes wrong, it's going to happen quite quickly on an eboard

Good luck!

Maybe it's because I just look like I stepped out of a Snoop level hotbox at all times, but ups, USPS and fedex all hate me and have denied all battery shipping efforts I've given. 

My only working shipping method is illegal, unfortunately. I understand the point polar makes, but there's always two sides to it when it involves the post office :roll_eyes:

It might be because I work for a global manufacturing/distribution company. USPS won't send lithium batteries ever. But UPS and FedEx will send them no problems if marked correctly with ground only shipping. Been doing it for years now.

UPS with ship for sure no problems. Just talked to their driver about a minute ago.

Nice, glad you had a good experience.

Always be aware though that batteries often times can look good in shrink wrap, but have less than optimal quality where it counts.

Not saying that is the case here or anything, just good to be aware....

I'm guessing you haven't had any issues with the pack so far? May I ask the approximate number of miles or cycles on it?

I don't like that taped bit at the bottom... Does the shrinkwrap not completely enclose the battery? 

What's the white stuff too? More shrinkwrap?

I usually shrink mine (lipo and liiom) twice. It makes it easier to get to the BMS sensor plug to measure voltages and saves shrink when you only have to replace part of it.

The white stuff at the bottom is like a stiff plastic-like pad just meant to protect The batteries, it’s on both sides. The black is just more tape to close up the sides. No issues with the pack so far, only a couple miles on it because I’ve had school and I’m still testing it out while wondering why California is raining all the time 😢

It truely is a bummer man, forecast in Cali says partly cloudy and no chance of rain then next thing you know it, it starts pouring on you. Even when the rain dries up, the floor is damp and your wheels will be slipping, caused me to face plant.

another user on the forums @808Chopz has reported ordering and receiving a battery from Chris, figured I would put it up here and in a little we can check back with you to see how things are going. 

@RealaPolarBear Hey PolarBear, how is your pack holding up?

Working really well!!  Having a blast cruising longer range. Will post my full review next week on the battery range. Still in testing mode.

I just checked in with @the-frenchie and it looks like the board from Pitbull was *finally* received. Looooong time coming, but glad we got some results.

Frenchie can we get you to chime in on this once you've had time to test it out and review? Cheers mate!

My board is holding up great, battery works great and it’s a pretty noticeable upgrade from two 3s 5000mah lipos

Just to clarify... You're upgrading from a 6s battery to 10s. 

May I ask what you're riding?

I am currently  riding a single motor 10s5p setup using TB VESC and 97mm wheels if that answers your question, let me know if you want specifics and i'll provide.

Thank you! Do you know what battery cells were used? 

May I ask the same basic questions of your previous board?

Any update here? Haven't been able to find any other reputable lithium ion US sellers besides Pitbull's site. I'm considering getting a 10s4p or a 10s3p to replace my old SLA 36v pack. Any thoughts from any recent customers of pitbull electric skateboard?

I've not heard back how things went, good or bad. Other sellers you might want to look at are longhairedboy or @thisguyhere? 
You'll find a list of trusted vendors here. https://forum./t/trusted-vendor-list/5465
