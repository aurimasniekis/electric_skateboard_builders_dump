I’m trying to get to level 3 I’ve been here over a year and probably been on for 365 days straight and still can’t get the member level. I think level 4 does have to be appointed to you by a mod

Sorry my reply was to @briman05.
As for you, it seems you are at member level, it is between the lines under your picture next to trust level.

Wait a gosh darn minute!!!

I’ve been buying all these sweet enclosures from a LEVEL 2?

I demand all my money back for no good reason!

Or maybe the mods could just let @Eboosted level up for making tons of awesome enclosures, or he could borrow one of my levels... since Level 2 appears to be pretty useless, and I don’t seem to sell anything.

@Eboosted you’re now level 3. You can run a group buy.

What do you have to do to get level 3? Do you need a mod to promote you or does it do it automatic

## \#26 Posted by: Mikenopolis Posted at: 2018-11-18T07:02:44.417Z Reads: 122

Pretty sure it’s automatic once those minimum requirements are met. But inactivities would eventually “demote” you back a level.

Giving or receiving more than a certain amount of flags can also temporarily demote you

Yay I didn’t even realize I was level 3 now I just need to not loose it I don’t like the fact that I can loose my trust level because I am on everyday but may not have something to contribute because someone has already said it I think my main posting is in the noob question this way the veteran don’t have to deal with it.

...then @onloop could be the reason for more than half the flags I received in all my dealings with this forum. Glad that fact hasn't demoted down my trust level 3 to the oscure abyss where lord Skatan lurks censored for all eternity.
