I am searching for dimensions of 63mm motor stator. Maybe someone has taken one apart and could provide me with dimensions like outter diameter and inner hole diameters without bearings and etc.

The most used are 51.8 and 52.8 mm if I remember correctly. Let me double check.

Your are asking too much to my memory. I can't even remember where I read the OD but I am pretty confident it was 52.8

I had an idea to reuse stator on hub motor but the inner hole is too small. Don't know how much would cost to make a different style punch template but was just a hunch maybe its possible :D
