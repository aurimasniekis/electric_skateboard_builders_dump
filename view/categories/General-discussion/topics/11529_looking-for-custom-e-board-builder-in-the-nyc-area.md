I'm very new to this. Looking for someone to build a custom board for me. I was thinking about buying an lectric board which is only $600 with fast speed and a lot of miles but does have problem from the reviews I read. Can someone please give me advice. Budget $800-$900...

Not looking for something to go super fast just a bit better than Yuneec or similar to a boosted board 15-20mph.

@longhairedboy is the king of custom builds. All though it seems your budget is a bit low compared to what he usually does. 

I would be happy to build you a board and your specs are reasonable for the price you stated. It can be totally tuned to your specs, with custom enclosures. PM me if interested.
