So I've switched helmets again. My hair is big and full face helmets give me headaches. I understand how dangerous eskating can be and although I didn't hit my head, I did get hit by a car while wearing my lighter skateboard helmet. So, I finally bought another one. It wound up being black and I know how hard it is for people in there cars in broad daylight to see us so I figured I'd creatively make my helmet more obvious. I'm specifically looking for ways to look more noticeable in daylight. I actually think neon lights and all the lights on my board make me noticeable in the dark. So that hasn't been a problem yet.![20180404_211151|412x500](upload://eu17ypzKvZaaZofSkzgiX3Squ5b.jpg)


PS, I recommend trying the helmet on before buying it. I got to try out a bunch of different ones and learned how much differently different ones feel between brands and models.

Ok, so I like this idea and the neon Mohawk, so why not just neon multi-color helmet dreadlocks (and sideburns? = more visible.) Could even string some EL wire through it so it's visible at night too. Bright colors and dynamic head movement should attract some attention. (Add Predator body armor for added effect.) :crazy_face:

The best way for cars to see you in the daylight is to put a giant life-sized fake-car made out of styrofoam on your helmet and paint it to look like an actual car.

Really I don't think there is any really good way to get them to see anything else that isn't a car.  Swerving in your lane helps a bit.  The problem is you're trying to get someone's subconscious to detect you (when it's just on auto car-radar) by appealing to the conscious mind.  What you really need is a life-sized fake car on your helmet.  Or to take the other drivers back in time and train them to drive in a sea of skateboards instead of a sea of cars.

Sigh.  If only any of that was remotely feasible...


```a driver looking for cars perceives merely an absence of cars, not the presence of a motorcyclist/bicyclist/skateboarder/pedestrian```

I've noticed when road bikers have just the small flashing LED light on their bike or helmet I notice if right away.  More than anything even during the day this gets my attention.  It's small, lightweight and effective.

Yep i also think a blinking white LED front and red for the back of the helmet is the way to go for recognition.
Add funny colorfull stuff to make it more creative and visible by day :slight_smile:

^^ using these on my helmet they help not quite the same as something emitting light but the retroreflective stuff does work surprisingly well and can't see it without light going straight at it and coming back.

Have you ever tried on a TSG? Just curious because i have long hair and it works pretty well. I do not have dreads or braids, however, so i imagine that complicates things further.

Although i have Size L in most motorcycle helmets, even XL is a tight fit on the TSG pass.
So you might need a larger number if you consider buying one. Don't know about you other guys?!

Ive got a little keychain that has a blinking LED on it, just flip a switch.  I put it on my dogs collar for the specific reason of being able to see her easily.  Stands to reason it would work well on people too, in this case helmets.

I already have some neon lights in the rope type version. I was debating on using it on a reflective belt vest thing or helmet. I'm more concerned with daytime vision though. I feel like are easy to see at night with makes that an easy solution. I finally ordered the fluorescent hair things and some really reflective tape to design.
