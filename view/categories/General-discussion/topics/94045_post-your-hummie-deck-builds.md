I love my hummie decks and was wondering what others did with their hummie decks.  Here is my simple built.  I am not crazy about my current grip tape and might change the grip tape to hexagon or just black strips.  I am looking for more ideas to upgrade and change my built.  My next step is to diy a few simple motor bars around the motors and spray paint all the aluminum parts to black or green to match the wheels.

Could be helpful for the kickstarter if people gave an honest opinion of the hummie board (or hubs) or what their favorite thing about it is?

Why are you glad you chose a hummie? :slight_smile:

The micro drop, the width, the perfect length, the perfect concave, its the deck of my dreams, and plus the carbon fiber and cutout makes everything better

The micro drop locks in your foot perfectly without feeling that it's too much, the deck length isn't too long where it feels like a boat and not short like where you are riding a twig, the concave is just beautiful, the shape is one of the golden standards, and the width is just perfect to fit your foot very comfortably, not too wide where you can't control the board and not too thin where you have no leverage and is afraid of falling off.

This in my eyes is the perfect deck

What I like about the hummie deck is the cutout for the battery and vesc.  The cutout enable the 
use of  thin enclosure, the drop through gives low center of gravity and the combination of thin battery enclosure and drop through mount is perfect for low rider built.   Ridding a Hummie deck with 90mm flywheels, tb218 trucks is like gliding on ice.   The carbon fiber is also beautiful to look at.   I feel so bad to use grip tape to cover the carbon fiber.

Why are you glad you chose a hummie?
[/quote]

@Hummie 

Size, flex, cutout dimensions, thickness, ability to drop through, decorative CF top, general shape... it's all just right for me. It's a great platform, especially when paired with Ben's enclosure. It retains enough flex to be comfortable and gives you loads of flexibility in your build.

Hummie is also a pretty sweet mountain man and I would kiss his biceps.

You may not use my review without including the last part.

Single stack.![29|494x500](upload://pGGSC4f0BgWF60RYSSG3r9ILD3X.png)
 
Double stack.![57|502x500](upload://la30nJ3PRgCXkJjbrsWsTSGU3GF.png)
 
Notice the difference along the long side. The rise is much smoother on the single where it's slightly concave on the double.

I feel like i made the pack just a little bit taller maybe because i heatshrink each 2s6p pack then gave another shrink wrap but this time the whole pack. I feel by me doing that it made my pack a little bulkier

If you've done that with the packs it'll mean they don't fit in between each other I'd guess and make it taller?

How about some pictures of the battery. I don't see how the shrink wrap interferes unless you wrapped a single layer of 2s6p and then stack on top of that.

Some more closer pictures would be great with just the whole battery in frame from the front and some side pictures. 

The width of the battery shouldn’t matter since the enclosure is wider than the cut out. What could interfere is the battery position all the way to the back edge. You can move the battery forward since you have tons of space anyway. 

Here’s mine. Since they are stacked diagonally it tapers downwards at the end so enclosure fits nicely.

did he route for the baseplate too because it looks like wheel wells.  i cant imagine wheel wells helping and seems you just have to thin the nose.  but not too much.

will just do the single hole i think with the kickstarter and ben's enclosure attached for 325$.  what you think of that price?  and then really 25 for shipping maybe so 350$.

They did. The problem was bad decisions on my part. I routed the base plate and wheel wells for the rspec drive and the bottom bit for the AT drive I have on it right now cause the motor cans were hitting the deck, preventing me to turn. I should have just routed the bottom until the back baseplate screw holes, but instead routed until the front baseplate screw holes. 

I hope that made sense lol.

Just a bit at full lean.

https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/drop-mounting-surfrodz-rkp-on-hummies-deck/65767/37?u=skunk

Easy fix.

Better fix is adjustable baseplates.  The are slightly taller and give you extra clearance.

I had my hummie deck pretty damn low on haggy pneumatic tires. Motor clearance was the issue.  The extra 1/4 made worlds of difference for motor adjustment and being able to leave my trucks lose enough to carve without them hitting the deck at full lean.
I only ran one in the rear. Made it super stale.

Didn't want to cut holes in Ben's ultra nice enclosure for a vmeter. So I made this instead, to monitor charging. I can check voltages during rides on my phone.

On the 90mm popocas it's 15/34

Motors are 190kv i run them at 10s

I have the leather protected with mink oil. Water just rolls off of it. I'm not riding off curbs or doing any major terrain with this one.. leather is more durable than most believe. Think cowboy boots, baseball gloves, and saddles.. they can take a beating as long as they are conditioned and protected.

@Hummie it's not "only" leather - it's a leather *wrapped @bigben enclosure.
I Used spray contact on the back surface of the leather and also the face of the enclosure. Then very slowly laid and rolled the piece on while working all the contours inch at a time. Once it was covered, got the lap edges turned and trimmed. Then added a 2 inch wide neoprene lining all around the inside lip for sealing and also covering the leather's edge.  (Full build thread in the works)

In the 37mm and the 45mm how big of battery can fit these right in the middle of buying deck can't make up my mind maybe this will help.

I was just wondering about the two enclosures I ask about in the question above about the hummie deck. I'm not sure on which deck I'll get yet hopefully ur answer will help that decision out but I'm also looking at that markoneboards manta ur creating a enclosure for also. Battery is my concern.

The really big enclosure only really helps on the Hummie deck if you can widen the battery compartment on the deck. You would then need to reinforce the deck. 
The 37mm version suits the original Hummie cutout.
