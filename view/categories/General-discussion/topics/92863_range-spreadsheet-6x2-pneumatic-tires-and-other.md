Hey All,
I started a range spreadsheet for the 6x2 pneumatic tire builds (I added a sheet to track other wheel size).  I am hoping to track and find the best setup for range as most of us have found that range is severely affected by these larger tires.  
If you are running something similar, please contribute your data.  Thanks so much.
