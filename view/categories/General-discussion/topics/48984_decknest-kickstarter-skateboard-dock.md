Hey guys, just seen this on Kickstarter and thought some of you might be interested. It holds your board, remote and helmet and allows a route through for your cables for charging.

I would be concerned with the plastic build quality over time, the hooks are hollow with some plastic supports. If I got that I would keep the board just slightly off the ground just in case

I like the concept! It'd be great to build a DIY version that can be 3D printed. Perhaps the board could have a special plug or contacts on the front truck that let you just set the board on the hook and it would start charging.
