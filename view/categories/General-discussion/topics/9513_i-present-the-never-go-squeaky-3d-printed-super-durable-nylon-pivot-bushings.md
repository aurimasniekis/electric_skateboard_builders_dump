Hi forum,
I've been meesing around with 3D printing on how to use it to replace parts in my skateboard.
Its something simple and small that I can 3D print and can be used to replace worn parts.

Do you guys get squeaky bushings after using them long?

I had a excuse for getting to play with 3d printing so sure why not if anyone wants to try this too: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1768095
Tested on a 10km ride and seems to be working for now.
