From the image it looks like the motor is less than an inch off the ground. I'm concerned it will scrape the ground if you roll over a large sidewalk crack or speed bump at an angle.

Thoughts?

Honestly, a whole new topic for this? It's discussed in the thread multiple times.

It's a 70mm motor, anything over 90mm wheels is fine.

Because finding information hidden in 1000s of replies is so simple...

If you go over a bump perindicular ofc it will be fine, but if you roll parallel over a bump that is 2 cm high then the motors could easily scrape

There are 500 comments, which should be read before buying. 

The last four comments on the thread discuss wheel size.

People have been using Carvon drives with thinner cans for years without major issue.

That looks like an issue albeit not a new one. I think motor needs to be guarded by a replaceable plate. However, other DD have been being used for some time so it may not be as serious of an issue.

The question should be what is the ideal motor to wheel diameter ratio? Apparently Torque Boards has it figured out that the 110's are best for these drives.

It can scrape for an 83mm wheel but I don't think the actual height difference is much of a difference compared to motor mounts (not motors).

90mm would be perfect. You can go smaller but I wouldn't want too.

We all ride on flat grounds with some rocks..

I imagine everyone rides on rocky trails :)

@boramiNYC - We thought of a replaceable plate but it would add to the thickness even more.

We wanted to release a bigger wheel overall and they would be perfect for our TBDD setup. But you can easily run 90mm's on our setup as well.

How's that puzzle coming along? It doesn't seem to change much in your pics over the last week.

What's it going to be in the end?

@slydunan Look it will barely have clearance and will most probably be hit. They ARE protected by a thicc 4mm can. 

I believe they will last, just look at @fliess 's DD's (he also put a thicc protective can around)

Edit: I have been looking at their website, every 10 damn seconds they sell the DD's

With the 110's would it best to pick the lower kV drives for the extra torque or do the higher kV drive still perform well up hills even with the larger wheels? Of course we want the speed of the higher kv's but don't want to be pushing to get to the top of a big hill

@B_in_tha_OZ 75KV is better if you want more torque. I'd probably find out how often you plan on riding top speed. 75KV should be good for 35-40mph and would also be better if you plan on swapping to pneumatics.

Since this thread has been bumped and new members might find this in a search looking for answers.

TB DDs with 110mm wheels there is 22mm clearance.

ABEC 107s with 40t pulley has 20mm clearance.

Clearly you'd best go over ridges head on rather than at an angle, but other than that, there is more clearance than you'd assume.

And if you ever bottom out on a curb like I did, the motor cans are strong, very strong. You can see the damage in this picture... :wink:

I suppose if they bump the pavement,  because it spins with the wheel the damage would be less than something that is fixed like a belt/chain motor mount.

It doesn't gouge as much as it makes a dent...
