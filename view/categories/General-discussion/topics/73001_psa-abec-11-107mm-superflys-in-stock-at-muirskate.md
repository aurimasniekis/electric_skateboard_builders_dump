Later this year we will be adding 97mm and 90mm SuperFlyâ€™s (wider to the outside) and an 83mm BigZig HD offering with an integrated pulley on a smaller core which has a TON of urethane for such a (relatively) short wheel.

That bigzig... Poor wallet.

Small wheels would be great for uphill racing.

Those 83's are firmly aimed at the boosted crew I reckon.  I'm just excited because how long will it be before we see 97/107 with pulleys.  The only thing I can see being a problem is wear.  Once the pulleys are cactus then so's the wheel.

yeah i recently fit my 32T kegel core pulley on an Ahmyo Akasha and had good results, as did a customer of mine. Those would be great track racing and uphill wheels for sure.
