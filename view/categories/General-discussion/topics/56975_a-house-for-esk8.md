I recently got into an argument with a now exgf about my priorities. 

At one point, I said something along the lines of , ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not your project. I just want to skate. Also stop filling my fridge with your fancy bullshit. I don‚Äôt want quinoa or pesto in my house. I just want plain chicken. I just want to skate.‚Äù

...so, now single doctor here with sweet boards and a 911s for when I‚Äôm out of charge or it rains. 

See attached photos for the general disarray my place trends to during builds and tinkering. I apologize to no one. I have no regrets.

Reminds me of this quote. My wife was the one that found it. We give each other time to do the things we enjoy

I just imagine you screaming like the suicidal tendencies but instead of only wanting a fucking pepsi,you just wanted to skate? Did she by chance call your hobby a never ending money pit or is that just my wife

Perfect, my name is even Mike.

She is a CPA, on a nonstop quest to get me to set up a LLC and make some kinda shop a write off my skate expenses. She calls the car a money pit. I call it freedom.

Yikes! never date or marry an accountant. They definitely view your life like an effing tax form. my sister-in-law is one. Always giving unwanted financial advice that take the joy out of life.

[/quote]

It's the crop that's destroying more forests and wild animal's natural habitats every year because of the rising demand for farmland for it by vegans who want to feel good about themselves for eating "organic" (ha!) and not eating animals. Same goes for tofu. Go figure.

@Arzamenable congrats man, I hope the change is a good one for you. I think many of us have to manage that same challenge- when a passion for an art can collides with needs of relationships and family. @Mikenopolis I like that quote!

LOL... You have 3 choices:
1) Stay Single and free
2) GF that has her own board
3) GF that understands space
I prefer #3. Some girls think it is an advantage that they know how to play golf.

Funny thing is, she is a kiteboarding (the water type) instructor. She can skate, but she thinks it‚Äôs fuck-off time to take selfies and drink coffee through busy intersections when she rides with me. (Admittedly, I‚Äôm guilty of both). I‚Äôve uttered the phrase, ‚Äúpay the fuck attention‚Äù more than once on rides with her. 

I think a confident new esk8r is dangerous rider until they have had a fall or close call and they know The Fear.

this should had been made into a short film...
-clean house, eating weird healthy shit had no idea existed, 9-5 job, GF
-then...
-no GF, fridge full of pizza and beers(some empty), waiting for sink to fill completely so you can do dishes, "a ramp for your skateboard off the deck/patio", "pull up bar"....

love it man, good stuff! @Arzamenable

My wife has argued with me about my different hobbies but I will say that when I took a spill yesterday and called her to see if she could pick me up so I didnt get injured more she dropped everything and came.  I do agree with you that if someone cant be with you for your addictions then they dont deserve you.  I basically converted your dining room into my board building area for my custom boards, but it was her idea to do that.
