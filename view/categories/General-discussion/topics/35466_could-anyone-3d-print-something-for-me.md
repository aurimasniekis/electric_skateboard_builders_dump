Hey Guys,

The only 3D printer I have access to is a useless one in school that has the smallest printing area.
I have not finalised the sketch (whatever you call it don't know much about 3D printing) but I like to plan ahead so I need to know if I will be 3D printing the enclosure for my electronics or making it out of metal or wood :(. so I am asking if anyone in the UK (I live in Ireland so postage would be a lot from America) would be able to 3D print it for me (roughly 250mmx150mmx6mm) and could post it to me. I will pay for it Of course. 

I don't know if this will work or not I hope it does but it is worthwhile asking

Thanks guys :slight_smile:

I might have a mould for something like that. 6mm thick though, that's some thin electronics?
