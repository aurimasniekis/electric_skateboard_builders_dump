Hallo
I¬¥m looking for a Tsg Pass helmet in Europe. Unfortunately I have no chance to try one before i buy.
I measure my head to be around 58,5 cm (23inc) 
What would people recommend in size ? Medium or Large ?

Thanks.

Yes but both Medium and Large is saying 58 cm :confused:

A friend told me today, that a downhill helt should fit your face pretty snug, so i`m leading towards at the moment.

I have a 22.9 head, wear a 7 3/8s fitted cap. Medium was to tight for me. I went with a large and fit is perfect.

The cup or crown on the top of the head was slightly to small on the medium.

I'll throw a spanner in the works.
I've found the fit of the XL very snug and I'm 60cm. Like all helmets some types just don't fit the same on all heads. Where are you based? Is there anyone near who can show you their helmet so to speak?

It was the same for me with motorbike helmets. Shoei helmets didn't fit my narrow head, whereas Arai helmets were snug as snug can be.
If you're ordering from snowbitch(who have the best price) I think they have a good returns policy?

Do what I did. Goto your local skate shop and try on a tripple8 helmet.  Their size chart is the same as TSG.

I just received my TSG helmet today. The Ruroc XL just didn‚Äôt work out as it barely fits and presses onto my fat cheeks or is that cheek fats?  The only way to put that on was to take off the mask and chin guard. Returned it and bought the TSG XL. 

I was so pissed when it turned out to be painful to put on my fat head. (For reference. I wear a 7.5 fitted cap and it‚Äôs slighty loose). I decided to pull out the cheek pads which are magnetically held on and the TSG slipped on and off easily and it fits. I guess I‚Äôll lack the soft cheek landing when I eat it. I might see about thinning out the padding and putting it back in.

Also in case anyone is like me and hate having to push hair out of your face under a helmet because it gets pushed down when you put it on, I have used these skull cap with my helmet for ages. Basically a bandana without a knot, it‚Äôs also cooling and a sweatband

I had the same problem with the L cheekpads. It was really chafing my ears when putting it on and uncomfortably compressing my cheeks, with no cheekpads it was roomy, with only one it was snug but not too much so I ended up solving it by ripping them open at the inner seams to extract the foam, splitting one of the foam pads in 2 with the sharpest blade I could find, putting the 2 halves back in my 2 cheekpads and resewing closed with a needle and thread.
Now it's really perfect.

I found the pass to run small (XL)  so I sold it and got the ruroc XXL and life is good :grinning:

Seemed like the cheek pads softened up a bit over time. Either that or my head shrank :smile:

I like the gold üëç Looks sick!

Hi @Silverline how did you go with the medium now you've been wearing it?

I have a 58cm head my medium arrived today.
The guy in my shop said the same... a downhill helmet should fit your face 
pretty snug and the cheek guards will soften up.

I put mine on today for about 5 minutes it was snug or firm ‚Ä¶..tight ish.
My head went blue it must of swollen and just for a second I thought this isn't coming off....don't panic lol
It didn't fog up that was impressive.

Just kidding it was tight.... hahahaha

What do you think?

Hey @Mikenopolis did you get your cheek pads sorted out?

They are a tight fit. Everyone I've talked to riders....shop assists have said 
go with a firm fit they will free up a bit all round.

Nope. It took them off and never put it back on. Safety wise it‚Äôs obviously better to have padding. But it‚Äôs was impossible to put over my head. I actually put the pads into a bag and put it under my couch leg for a month to flatten it, it bounced back after a day though

I did like you tip for taming your fringe from getting in the way.
