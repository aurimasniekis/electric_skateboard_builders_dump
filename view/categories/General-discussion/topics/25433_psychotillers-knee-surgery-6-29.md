My surgery is quickly approaching. We have 2 weeks to make any custom enclosures and ship out any outstanding orders. After the 29th of this month, likely it will be a month before I am able to do anything. Realistically, being my doctor is saying I wont be able to go back to work for nearly a year, Orders are going to take longer to receive. 

I don't wan't to shut down completely so I've enlisted some help. Just please understand, They are going to be figuring things out as they go. 

If you have anything you need right now for a build, now would be a good time to order it. I'll get it shipped before surgery.

Thanks for all of the praise and support. It never goes unnoticed!

Recovering from knee surgeries are a bitch and it DOES take a while to fully recover. But it's best to do so, take it easy and all that. Else it can all backfire :fearful:.

Had just finished up a ride, We decided to ride down the street to get some food. I switched boards. When we got up to cruising speed, I throttled up and just lost control. Not entirely sure why. It happened really fast. In the tumble I tore through my pcl (it's the one that's missing in the picture) and my mcl. I've managed to put up with it for almost 2 years and my mcl healed up really well, but last week I popped my mcl again while working on a floor in my house and now my leg is basically falling off. Lol Seriously it bends in 4 different directions. 

Anyhow, I knew I'd eventually be replacing my pcl. But I wasn't stressing about it. Now it's on the calander! 

As far as preventing something like this, I would say it could have been prevented had I had my A-game in gear. But I really wasn't paying attention. Complacency is bad.
Always wear a helmet.
Use good, proven (e-skate) components.
Make sure your receiver/board combo has a functional failsafe. If it does anything weird, don't ride it until it's fixed.
If you're a newbie-learn basic longboard skills. Carving/Sliding/Scrubbing speed/Proper body positions. Especially before you build a board that hits downhill speeds.
Don't mess with your PCL ligament. It will kick your ass. 
Make sure you have health insurance. LOL

@psychotiller I very much agree! People say 'wear a helmet' all the time. A helmet is very important, but will only protect you so much.

You point out something thats probably the most important: make sure your board is reliable, especially if you use it in traffic!! When my board was just finished one belt very occasionally came off, losing power and bringing the board to a stop. This happened once with a car right behind me, i had to bail the board and was able to run off the speed. I was lucky the driver behind me was paying attention, the other 2 options were being hit, or falling and getting run over. I fixed my belt alignment and now they haven't come off since. 

Remote reliability is also very important. Losing control over your board on a hill or when going fast is a recipe for disaster. Its even worse if the board starts doing random stuff! If that happens, dont ride, fix it.

In traffic, make sure you're visible, especially at night!

Always be aware of your speed and practice emergency braking at various speeds. Your board takes 5-10 seconds to get up to speed, but you'll have far less time to come to a stop in an emergency. On my board the brakes are good, but it still takes some distance.

And as pointed out, at least make sure you know how to brake with your foot such that if your board ever loses power you wont wreck yourself.

This all starts when building your board. If the roads are rough get large wheels, get a reliable controller, get reliable electronics, and make the board mechanically reliable as well.

Good luck and stay safe!

My father tore his MCL, ACL, and something else. He was off work for 6 months and literally did nothing. The doctor instructed him to not use it for 6 months. He didnt and has gone 10+ years with no issue while his friend had the same surgery last month and is already riding a bike while complaining his knee hurts. So yeah, jist of the story, stay off of it and do what the doctor says and you'll be back up like it never even happened! Best wishes man!

Presurgery appt. was today. Looks like I need another round of mri's tomorrow and will most likely be having 2 surgeries because they can't fix pcl, mcl and meniscus all at the same time. REALLY?!?:confused: :mask:

Listen to the doctors!  They *kinda* know their shit.  Two surgeries is better than more years of pain and gimping around ...  sooner you heal up the sooner you can shred again!

Heal up quick brother!

Had a similar thing happen to me,luckly at slow speed,my board just decided to go full throttle and threw me off! 
Landed on my arm but didn't break it! Iv heard if you don't tence up when having an accident there's less chance in breaking anything,probably explains how I came off a motorbike on black ice at 50mph and walked away with just a scratch.
Anyway turns out my signal wire was loose from vesc to reciever,took a while for me to pluck up the courage to go full speed again,we had trust issues for a while lol 
Like @psychotiller said make sure you have your board running correctly before you get back up to speed,could happen to any of us! Hope you have a speedy recovery man! All the best.

 But lsten to your docs & when the time comes do the physio till you cry and good things will happen. ✌️

-UPDATE-

My surgery went well. It was a 4 hour surgery, but they were able to fix everything in one visit! My bandages include a refrigeration system that circulates ice water. Pretty cool! (pun intended)

Thanks for all of your positive vibes! It worked :+1:

 Wishing you a speedy recovery. My wife has one of those things. Ours came with a little cooler that holds the water. After recovery, these are outstanding for transporting and storing beer in Florida summer temps. I even adapted a DC plug  so we can travel with it.  Given the fact that it is a medical device we probably paid $9000 for it, I'm damn sure going to get a lifetime of use out of it.

Great! I've been going to PT and battling for a little range of motion. I'm agile enough now to crutch around pretty much anywhere and can put a little weight on it without too much pain. Haven't taken pain pills in about 4 weeks. (took 50 Hydrocodones the 1st week) 
I still have an open hole below my knee where they drilled into my tibia and femur. Not sure why that hasn't healed, but it doesn't hurt so whatevah!!! New piercing.

hopefully they knew what they were doing...They drilled a foot long hole up through my tibia and then through my femur to thread my new pcl ligament into. Brutal!!!

My knee was pretty messed up. They told me to begin with there was no way i was going to be 100% after the surgery.

i'm just glad i can walk and ride.
