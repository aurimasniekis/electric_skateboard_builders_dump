Seems like Carvon is shipping out the V4 drives from the group buy. Received mine today. Unfortunately the box that it was packed in was damaged. Opened the box and you can tell the box was too small for the drive and not enough packing was used. Took the drive out, spun each motor and the one motor that was facing the damaged side of the box doesn't sound right. Just my luck. Time to contact Carvon. Hopefully everybody else's arrives undamaged.![GEDC0234 (640x428)|640x428](upload://woKlXAAu5mFOIyDaioLOE1LqaPB.jpg) ![GEDC0235 (640x428)|640x428](upload://yvLeqTOTwNScN2auw1fI6ZZXnhw.jpg)![GEDC0236 (640x428)|640x428](upload://31m2ggV1wVGVq4qXiqVWXgmUM3w.jpg)

Congrats on getting your drive. I'm pretty sure shipping shouldn't damage an item that was designed to take quite a lot of abuse under your board.

All I can say is the worst packaging I have seen for something probably weighing 5 lbs and too much dead space. The box should survive intact.

Agreed there. Poor packing.That's exactly how it sat in the box before I took it out other than the packing that was on top of the drive. The poor packing caused the entire drive to shift around in the box during transport causing the box to rip open. Upon closer inspection of the box, there's a puncture hole in the box on the opposite side.

Yeah, I noticed that also. Not too sure what it means. I'm thinking it's just USPS way of covering themselves from filing a claim. Lets hope not.

it's not damaged,my speed drive r flew 5 feet into the and landed first on the speed r and it's not broken. Show  a video of it spining I'll tell you if it's cracked. sometimes the sound is the speed ring around it . to break a magnet is pretty impossible. There glued all the way around I know because I did them and have a retainer alone for the magnets to not move.

I'm hoping you are right. I'm still going to try to contact Jerry about this. I'm wanting to make sure its ok for me to bench test to see if they are ok.
I still stand by my statement that the item was poorly packed. When a heavy item in a box can shift around, the box gets damaged from the inside out.

I'm not saying it was a good or bad packing job --

But what I am saying it that's super-difficult to pack longboard trucks.  Even the ones I get from TB and Evolve are in a destroyed box by the time they arrive, with axles sticking out ...

I just feel this is kinda wrong and title is misleading but anyways reason why I think this is not cracked is for the fact I have seen v3's come back to the shop to be serviced for some reason or another and the motor can is bent and beaten  the crap out of and the magnets are still intact.  the motors themselves are protected by a steel not aluminum but steel can and then motors press fitted in magnets glued  and then a magnet retainer that connects all magnets for even more safety and that as well is glued with high resistance glue @cdn

Nobody likes to see bad things about something they’ve worked on. Truth is though, something this heavy and shape should be wrapped in bubble wrap. Yea it’ll cost an extra $2 to pack, but it’s well worth it to have good presentation when it arrives to the customer. This is not good presentation.

Nice to know you guys are putting magnets in your self. Are you winding your own motors yet?

magnets are not being in glued  one by one there factory glued in but the glue is weak so we add a extra layer of glue that connects all of them so there intact along with a magnet retainer that is also glued in. Presentation or not these things are pretty robust to be broken because a mailman not us dropped it . Now we've never had a issue using this method of wrapping but will talk to jerry about it. Saying presentation again as if it was our fault the mailman dropped it somehow Carvons fault . (I do acknowledge that you can say the wrapping is not drop protection but there really robust to be broken that easily is what am staying never had issues with shipping) @evoheyax

Regardless, if it's damaged, you are the shipper, you have to file the insurance claim, not him. So, if that means replacing them out of your(carvon's) pocket, and file and wait for the insurance claim. Just remember your place in a business transaction. Glad your trying to help, but again he can't file it, you have to if it is broken. Not trying to start anything, but no need to be so abrasive as the face of a company, since Jerry doesn't visit here.

don't get me wrong I am not saying I am not willing to work with him or carvon to fix his issue, my arguement is that I don't think he broke anything and am asking for a video and I explained why I don't think  it's broken.  Now if look at the video and ask for jerry's input and he try to resolve it and he still thinks it is broken were more than happily to take it back and replace it . we're just trying to avoid opening it up to find nothing wrong with it.  I got paranoid too at one point with my speed drives opened it up to find nothing broken.

@Exiledd_Top
Even if nothing is broken, these should be packed better. 

IT IS NOT YOUR FAULT SOMEONE ELSE DROPPED IT OR THREW IT OR MISHANDLED IT.

It is Carvon's fault that it was packaged poorly.  
It is great if nothing is broken but take this as a moment to learn from a minor mistake. All you have to do is go talk to Jerry and say: hey man, someone in the forums had their drive arrive in a beaten up box, maybe we should wrap the drives in bubble wrap.

If Jerry decides it's not worth his time, then that's his choice as the business owner and if anything is wrong that'll be on him...

 I already stated that I was going to talk about it . Now I also explained  why we did what we did because we never had any shipping issues . 
I was saying I don't believe it was our fault but will take responsibility because it is our product and it was not user error. I feel am just saying the same thing over and over because people are just saying there opinion on the problem   that I already have addressed ( not towards u @PXSS)

Miguel. Just stop talking, wait for verification that there is an issue with this specific drive. There’s no point arguing. If you put yourself in the shoe of the customer, you’ll see it his way and vice versa. It’s best to get proof and have Jerry decide and you can just help with communication. Probably best via DM so you don’t get all of us hammering on the keyboard. 

As for shipping. Mine was the same with the axle killing the box even though it was wrapped in the bunch of bubble wrap I sent to him. I would suggest wrapping a bit of cardboard around the axle before putting it in the box to help thicken up those areas.

Thanks for trying to help. I don't know how I'm going to upload a video. No means of recording. I'm one of the older members here, 54 yrs old. I'm a little behind of the times.
Did manage to bench test the motors. Ran one motor at a time to do a comparison. One side runs smooth and the other side sounds a little different and feels to be off balance.  Place my hand on the truck while running and you could feel the vibration on one of the motors. The motor giving the problem was from the damaged side of the box. 
About the box that it came in. If you looked at it, you can clearly see the damage was caused from the inside out. The side of the box with the USPS tape, the opening goes clear across the box. Definitely doesn't look like any cuts in the side of the box on the damaged side. Box doesn't seem to have been cut open at any time. Only one layer of packaging tape on it. 
Not sure what to do at this time. What I'd real like to do is send the motors and damaged box back to Carvon.![GEDC0237 (640x428)|640x428](upload://1f0shg1fx0OkVasGoqvHuPtkEk9.jpg)

So delay after delay on these motors because they didn't want to send them out without the PU covers so they wouldn't break.  Idiot proof I seem to remember them saying.  After many many months of waiting for these with no communication, and when they finally do send them, it's in piss poor packaging!?  Wow...  Just, wow...

I used to work for FedEx and there would often be boxes that were trashed.  Mainly the cause of this was some heavy object that was loosely packed in the box.  It's not USPS's fault that the box got damaged.  When packages are being shipped they move around a lot.  If the items inside the box aren't securely packaged, such as in this case, a heavy metal item with sharp edges, it's definitely gonna shift around a lot and destroyed the box from the inside.  That is the fault of the person who packed it, not USPS fault.

I am not exactly sure, but I assume anywhere along the route if the package is damaged or contents go missing, they do their best to patch it up a bit and slap that sticker on it. 

I received a package with this label on it, half the contents were missing. The packing was in very poor condition, had been originally closed with only one layer of tape, only taped around the edge about an inch. box arrived to me with one half (that side lacking tape) wide open and parts flailing around the inside willy nilly... but half of my stuff was there at least.

USPS cannot be held liable for people who pack lacking sufficient packing materials, packing tape, etc. If you put a bare knife in a bubble mailer and expect USPS to held liable for not getting it to it's destination in perfect condition... you are crazy. Wrap things right, pack things right, use extra packing tape... and this shouldn't happen.

:-) Just my thoughts. Vendor covered my lost parts too btw.

Yes sometimes packages can get tossed around in the time crunch the shipping company's have to deal with, but if these were just properly packaged it wouldn't matter.  For as expensive as these motors are, you'd think they would of had proper packaging made for them so they would be secure and not shift around while in transit. It's baffling how these weren't shipped out until many months past when they were supposed to, so they would be designed to last longer and not need to be returned if something went wrong, and then they disregard all of that when it comes too shipping the product to the customers.

Yep. I'd at least bubble wrap the trucks first, and stuff that cardboard puffy stuff or packing foam popcorn and stuff around the bubble wrapped and taped trucks, and then put all that inside a box and taped it up nice. At least. I go overboard when I pack things though so i'd probably have added in more crap to make it super secure in there.

One time I packed and shipped a motorized scooter across the country. I was afraid the box wouldn't hold, but it was like an inch thick cardboard, supported by padded plywood on the bottom for it to rest on, with thick foam taped all around the edges, bubble wrapped, and padding to keep everything upright inside the box, somewhat super secure, but it still felt a bit wobbly to me. The buyer messaged me back when he got it saying it was in perfect condition and that the packing was the best he had ever seen, everything stayed put just right... and that's like an entire vehicle getting thrown around warehouses lol.

What most likely happened is that it was just on the conveyor belt and got stuck and fell off or had another box tip over on it. That would be the fault of usps. My company has ordered 50lbs vac pumps and have had them come in with a large crack in the aluminum with oil everywhere in the box. The packing should have had bubble wrap wrapped around the system and taped to seal it. The tape would be on the package because the drive system had punctured the box and damaged the box so they taped it to keep it inside the box. So fault goes a little on both. If you insured it and to show them pictures of it like that they would say it was not properly packed and deny the claim.

I worked at UPS once and if for a second you think think your package "might" get tossed, you're wrong.  If you think writing "fragile" on the box does anything except waste ink, you're wrong.

The reality is that it "will" get tossed.  The way they unload trucks is to back the truck up to a conveyor belt and go inside and throw everything inside out the back door.  Remember there are like 50 trucks that have to be unloaded as fast as possible, and that's just on this conveyor belt...

So it's best to pack things in a way where you feel comfortable throwing it across the room after you're done packing it.

I would file claim against USPS and do it ASAP

TL;DR: Every box gets thrown, it's standard operating procedure

When I got my torque drive the axles had stabbed through the side of the box. When I returned it I made sure to bubble wrap the axle tips really well and angle it to where it wouldn’t hapoem again. When I got my SD R one of the wires had split open from the hanger pushing on it. It’s not an isolated incident but I doubt they are intentionally ignoring the issue.

@ElskerShadow @chinzw  

Jerry said he will try to reply to your messages if YOU PM him on the forum @LEVer His account if currently in new member status so he can't reply on threads and can't start a PM. 

So send him a message with your full name so he can give you an accurate update

No idea how Discourse forums work

He was an active member a long time ago I think? then stepped out so now he needs to unlock features again. He doesn’t have a reply button. Only able to like a post

Blurry picture of what he sees. No blue reply button...can any moderators help out?

@Mikenopolis i've sent him numerous emails, he hasn't responded to any of them. This is getting tiring.

well try the PM thing. He said he's trying to be more proactive through PM. That's all I can say, the rest is up to him

Its weird cause I was having the same issue in one of the other topics. (The DirectDrive from Torqueboards topic)
I could see all the replies but I couldn't reply myself within that specific topic, although I could outside of it.

E: I still cant reply in that topic lol.

E2: I think it has to do with my regular badge being removed...?

Yeah he contacted me the drive is on the way! And he offered to take my V3's free of charge and upgrade them to V4. I guess that's a nice gesture from Jerry.

I wonder if I reach out if Jerry would upgrade my V3s...what is the upgrade over the V3s? Would it be worth the turnaround time?
