KTM has an electric dirtbike called Freeride E-SX/XC (dirt bike and enduro). It has almost as good acceleration as a racing 125cc 2 stroke. A 250cc 4 stroke will be just a bit faster than a 125cc 2 stroke, so if you want to have similar power output as a 250cc 4 stroke, you would want ~20kW peak, and 15kW continuous. 
If your looking to compete against 250cc 2 stroke, you would want something similar to the Alta dirtbikes, which claims 50hp peak.

Yeah i was hopeing for something like altas 250. A 2504stroke was more of the aera i was aiming for. I read the a crf250r which is the race bike outputs max 40hp so from what u said i think a 15kw motor would be able to support this. Although alta gives all theis specs here. Just no the motor of courseðŸ˜‘ https://www.altamotors.co/redshiftmxr#redshift-mx-1

As far as I know Alta never sold their motors alone, only premade bikes. 

I know of some guys that have used this motor: 
https://www.emf-power.com/product/motenergy-me1507/ 
It should handle about 20kw continuous, and 45kw peak. Would make for a beast of an electric dirt bike.

Following this because I want to do a go kart.  Going to get a mario outfit and hoon round the streets of the neighbourhood.  See if I can get in the local paper.  Has to be electric because the one time I rode a 2 stroke skateboard round here they called the police in 2 seconds

@dareno @J0ker3366 Zero doesnt have any dirtbike though. The FX model is the closest one, and is more of a motard style bike.   
The Altas were great dirtbikes, too bad theyâ€™re out of business.

Are we talking about Cuntin Furryz here? 

I cannot stand his face, his voice, his Barry Scott enthusiasm, his scripted lack of skill. I hope one of his talented team of engineers who make him look like he's good at making things realizes what a tosser he is and blows his balls clean off so that he can't reproduce and make more little shitstain children to ruin the internet for us.

Me too.  Then again I have been googling everything electric and eyeing up all the kids toys wondering what I can chuck motors on.  Boys pedal trike will get front wheel drive soon.  
My neighbour has one of those batman looking fat wheeled scooters and it is so much fun.  A full powered dirtbike would be a blast.  I know furze is a cock but the electric racing is fantastic.
