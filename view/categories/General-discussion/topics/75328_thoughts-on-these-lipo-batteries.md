Has anyone used or seen these in a build?? With black friday approaching ive been looking at finding a good deal on LiPo batteries to stock up for future use. 

At 60 dollars for a 4000MAH 22.2V 6S 70C LiPo battery, the only possible problem could be sag under high discharge, however people in the world of RC seem to like them:

I'd probably just stick with one we know for a fact is solid, especially because the price is very similar
