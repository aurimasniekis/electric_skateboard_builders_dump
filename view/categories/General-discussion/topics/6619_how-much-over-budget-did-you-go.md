I started out trying to build a board that was cheaper and better than a boosted board at around $1000 total. I'm pretty sure i'm well over $2000 by now in tools, parts,wood, and random little shit. The worst part is there is no end in sight because this is fun as hell. What's everyone elses story?

Holy crap, $2000? What did you buy exactly? D:

I planned a build for around $700, but I am stepping into $900 territory.

Addicting as hell

Just think of how much less you have to spend on your second build since you have extra stuff

```
Vanguard flex deck = $230
Dual tb 120a esc = $240
Dual motors = $220
Trucks and mounts =$200
Controler = $50
Bern helmet = $50
Wood for abs heater = $120
Abs sheets x2 = $40
Lipos = $100
Sbec = $30

Misc bolts and metal = $50
Shipping ( sum total) = $300
Misc tools (hex, torx, sockets) = $100

I bought everything lol. I have a problem. You're right though, second build can be done for a few hundred total!

I started with a 500 budget and ended at about 600.  Thing is, I did a single motor with 6s 5000mah and a 150A ESC. Pretty simple stuff. Already had my deck and every tool I would need to put things together. My only failures were with batteries, I managed to ruin 2 sets.

I wanted to get $1200 AUD and I would've if I hadn't made a few mistakes. I ended up getting around $1400 AUD. My next build should be around $1100 AUD

my budget was $800, I'm currently at $1200. I paid $60 for wheel that were $26 elsewhere, bought a paris truck when I needed a caliber, so I had to buy a new caliber as well. Bought a dwp that I wasn't comfortable with, so I had to buy another, then found better pulleys from a factory for a 5th of the cost, my @chaka  vesc was fried last night after 2 months of waiting, we'll see how long it is before I can send it in for repair. I bought a $60 on/off switch that I didn't need...I'm sure there's more that I wasted money on that I can't think of. Super rough first build, I've been waiting to ride it since March :/

is there a such thing as Ollin error? this was definitely "user" error. roommates friend plugged in my battery backwards. thank the lord it was just a 4s, I haven't soldered my batteries together into a 12s config yet. I'm sure that would've been a disaster.

edit: I should mention that just last year this same guy spent 8 months getting at least 70% of his skin grafted in the hospital because he accidentally lit himself on fire in his garage with some combo of gasoline+cigarette. Nobody touches my board from now on, especially not this guy.

2 months ?
He told me that their lead time on vesc's was 2 weeks.
I ordered a pair of them 2 weeks ago and thinking they would arrive any day now.

I placed my order on June 10th, it arrived two days ago, so 1.5 months. I should also mention that I was told 2 weekd initially, then 2 weeks again when I inquired, then it took two more weeks after that for it to arrive.

Yup, they sent me an email on the 18th saying it shipped, it ships from Elephant Butte (LOL), New Mexico. Oddly took just over a week to get here via post office.

My roommate and his friend are definitely odd, my roommate predicts his and my futures by reading playing cards and relating them to the positioning of the planets. He's a self described "rolling stone" who lives miraculously off of craigslist gigs. As long as he pays the rent and keeps the place clean I'm not really complaining lol

Initially aimed to spend around $1600 to build what is essentially a Raptor Mono sans the carbon fibre deck. Chances are I'm sitting closer to $2200 - $2500 at this point and I'm looking at spending another $600 or so for a second motor soon... Probably should've just bought a raptor dual from the get go.... :p

But then you would have missed all of this fun.

I was aiming for $700 originally and had many expensive tools already. I'm up to at least $4000 now, since I invested in my CNC milling machine. I have a bunch of motors, batteries and now boards, but only one working setup which will be salvaged the second I get two more vesc's from Chaka to make a quad motor drive board.

Haha true that, although to be fair, my board has been sitting waiting for parts much longer than it has been actually usable so far.

You do make me feel a little better about my spending though haha, would really love to invest in a CNC milling machine at some point.

Although for me, this has been while I've been a student up until a few weeks ago so expendable income isn't exactly a big part of my budget. At least uni is out of the way now so I won't feel so bad "wasting" so much of my money on one of my hobbies :p

Sold my Boosted that I bought for around $600 for $1000 (he was desperate), I've spent all of that money, and probably over budget by $100-$200, maybe less than $100 actually, not sure because I always had a few hundred hovering from when I got paid and stuff.I was going to buy a few tools, but I know a few people who can help me put it all together since they all have the tools already. 

 My list of things bought:

Enertion VESC, trucks, motor and motor mount 

40 Samsung 18650 25R cells (to be 10s4p pack)

I bought a piece of stiff marine plywood that I was $30 and I was able to cut two decks out of it (one similar to the Inboard, and my second will be similar to the Yuneec ego 2 so basically $15 each for a deck

Otang In Heats (plus two free Boosted drive wheels a friend gave)

Some Gates 219mm long 15mm wide belts

A Boosted Board remote (currently being modded by an RC expert) 

Pulley from RS components 

My latest purchase is an enclosure made out of fiberglass? I think? From @Mastercho 

I probably forgot about some small things, but all up, considering the bad USD to AUD rates, I was able to stick close in my budget of $1000 AUD which according to Google is $752.14 USD

I estimate that labor costs of getting the remote modded and a friend putting my battery pack together will cost another $100 or so...

You're Aussie too right? I was directed to this guy, who has an RC shop somewhere in Sydney and was told he helped someone build his e-board, and has a lot of knowledge in this kind of stuff. I'm still discussing details and I'm going to visit him sometime soon in the coming weeks, I can show you how it all turns out when/if it gets finished.

I shouldn't have said currently being modded, but it's been discussed and all and I just need to pop in to his shop.

It's really not the best tool to make boards. I'm making aboard unlike anything anyone's ever made before, just like my first board was also. But there's other cores and materials which you can make boards quicker. This process takes an hour per sheet to cut factoring in clamping time. And at 17 layers, it's hard to make it scalable to production.

Fair enough, I'm sure it would be handy for a bunch of projects either way. Curious to see what makes this board so different now. 
What I'm really looking forward to though is the day when consumer grade 3D metal printers start coming to market...

Will do, it is a costly project for some who don't already have the remote (I managed to get a brand new one free under 'warranty' even though it was out of warranty, but I'm not complaining), since you have to buy a new remote which costs a lot of money to begin with.

It was mainly the housing of the remote and the wheel trigger part I wanted anyways, so 3D printing might be a cheaper option. Not actually sure if 3D printing is 'cheap'? I need to get a very small part, about the size of my palm printed as a belt and pulley protector, wonder how much it'd cost for a company or someone to print it.

I started with around a $500 budget, and am quickly approaching the 500% over budget zone. Actually, my first board ended up being less than $600, but has snowballed into 3 working boards, and parts for another 2 more. @Michaelinvegas' Dave Chappelle reference was dead on. Lol. But like @Stevemk14ebr said, this shit is fun as hell, so no regrets...so far.

So far, I'm about $200 over what I originally planned on spending. The new deck and second remote were the main things, but I blew around $100 on all those little parts. Wires, tools, switches, shrink tube, odds and ends... I sold my Evolve setup for a grand to fund my DIY. Ended up spending only around $100 more. Not too bad. 

Of course now I want to build a board that's a little lighter, maybe go for a dual motor...

@itsmikeholland , Sorry to hear the news, send it in and I will get it back in working order. Be sure to leave some kind of note letting me know what happened. Speeds up the repair time. 

@Namasaki  We test every single VESC twice. The first test we make sure the bootloader and firmware is working properly and motor detection works. The second test we load the motor and make several hard directional changes and aggressive throttling at 10s. We do everything we can to make sure they work flawlessly before sending them out. And yes, we still assemble these here in our shop. :factory:

I started out with what I thought was a decent budget at $1500, but then I fell in love with all of the knowledge that I found on Endless Sphere and on this forum. So I bought a spot welder, upgraded my soldering station, bought a spool of 10AWG wire, a roll of griptape, shrink etc....In the long run, I'm hoping that it will save me a few $$$. Maybe I can hook up some of my friends. What I'm really investing in is the whole package. I want to learn as much as I can so that I can share what I know. I want to step up to the benchmarks set by my heroes in the ESK8 community. I want to give back because I have big gratitude towards everyone that has helped me out or even just posted their experiences. When I research, it feels like digging for gold! So many interesting personalities and levels of technical knowledge. I still feel like a little bitty fish in a big ass pond, but I'm growing and trying to pay my dues.  Probably went double budget, but I have a lot of good spare parts now.
