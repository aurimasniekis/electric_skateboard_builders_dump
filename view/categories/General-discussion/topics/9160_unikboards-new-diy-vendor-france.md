Hey mate ! Just saw your message. Unfortunately I'm no more supporting UNiK. I've work so hard for years and given so much of mine time and money; but having the wrong partner is never a good choice, but sometimes even when you help people to grow.. it may take time or they will just never get it.

I've sent an email to Ben to ask him to report back to you as soon as possible (he is handling this or at least, this is the only thing he has to do). This is obviously not acceptable and totally against the way I see user experience, commitment and delivery. 

Let me know if this is not sorted out quickly with him.

He keeps telling me it has been sent or that he will go to the post office today to get an update ( even though I believe they are closed at this time....meanwhile all i see on my side is this![Screenshot_20190531-134119|281x500](upload://vHRUlVtw92ifjQyPVZkNjJXkDnY.png)

mmm. which email are you using to communicate with him? Did you use the contact@unikboards.com email? can you send me full email exchange to the email above. I'll take care about it.

I'll see the emails, but you need to know that 27 of may is bank holiday in France, so his only option was either to ship it Friday, or Saturday, or Today.

I can understand that but if he shipped it out like he says in the emails, I would be able to see it in the postal tracking system, no?

Unless something is wrong with the post office (that can happen), anything that is shipped with a tracking system can be tracked online. So 
1 - he's playing and has not sent anything
2 - he sent it and the post screw it

Super simple. I just sent him also an email cause I have at this moment the same level of info.

note: I'm not Ben, so to make it clear; I have never ever had any interaction with you except the one we are having now. My name is C√©dric (and not Ben) - Easy to figure out as the emails have a signature.

Yeah ive noticed that very quickly. I've done research on the company and all surrounding it. I usually never send money offshore to people (unless by PayPal) without at least knowing who I'm sending it to. When I saw Ben at the bottom of the emails I dug a bit deeper. You were referred to me by a fellow French eskater in mtl (pierre-edouard)

No worries man. I'll take care of the situation and get that sorted. It's obviously either over commitment which always lead to failure; or unfortunately, maybe the post screwed it. No big deal. You'll get either an apologize from him once he's clear about the situation... or maybe he posted it.

It's all about trust. In any case, your money is safe. It's just time spent that we could all focus on other more important topics. I'm in the same boat and I can tell you that this kind of stuff has always tendency to upset me. 

Just give him one day (maximum)

You talk in a way that breathes trust. I'll wait a day. Those are the missing links to the completion of my first build![15594171560367442095420154358223|374x500](upload://QjpiQI2wcfC99ZfXJBdEAkLvyX.jpeg)

that's normal, but trust is not a gift and sometimes unfortunately requires control. This is gonna be sorted soon. I'll take it personally.

Hey, 

The package has been flashed by the post office on Monday - today (previous to your message here). For some reasons which are impossible to verify apart from trusting the post office and opening a complaint against them. Basically I'm not able to tell you if Ben posted it on Friday like he told you, or today. I would love to and happily challenge anyone for the sake of clarity but it's impossible. I could still reach out to the post office myself but I'm not even sure who to trust, as I would have tendency to lack of trust on both. I'm not even sure that the post office will be able to tell me that they failed (which could be a realistic option)

So where are we. Package has been flashed today and the delivery process begins to your door.

If it was me, I could have told you my reality. Unfortunately, it's not.

![29|689x450](upload://rc0CyLajeMitdz60p7sHgFGkcNa.png)

Hope it helps man.

no idea if they have been sent as I've not manage the dispatch. I was always used to add more than ordered and extra stuff when I was managing this to avoid the failure. For the 44T, it's no big deal as the screw are the same as the one you already have.

But I don't have any, unless you speak of the screws that holds the hub together which don't look long enough to add a pulley
