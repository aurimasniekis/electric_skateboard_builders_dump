When i was creating the topic and looked at the "similar to yours" column i didn't see these helmets so i assumed they had not been talked about. Just seen the helmet thread though so good catch. Also i hope you didn't wake up on the wrong side of bed today :(

I've seen loads of topics on helmets and the conclusion mostly is Motorbike helmets have narrow viewing angles, And they weigh a bit more and are just designed for Motor bikes sure they'll work, But If you want a budget helmet you much rather go with Downhill MTB helmets, There made for bikers who go down hills you can see left to right Easy slightly lighter and better fitted for the job. If you want a very nice budget helmet I recommend this :)

I had a L/XL version of this. https://aob-boards.de/en-216-Helmet
It was larger than the tsg pass in xl.

not including the topics that discuss a single helmet brand.

if you include all the topics about protective gear you can roughly double the above...

I prob. missed a few and included some that are irrelevant.
