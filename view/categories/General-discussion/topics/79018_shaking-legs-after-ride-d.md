Gets some decent insoles, bend your knees and tuck your rear knee in a little bit, carve a lot as it alternates your weight between both feet.

The biggest thing is just ride, the more you ride the more you can ride.  I don't ride as much as I like too, work has been a complete PIA the last few months so after 10 miles or so Im aching.  There was  a time not long ago when I could completely drain 2 battery packs and still be good.

I remember when I first started skating my ankle hurt from pushing for such a long distance. After a few days of skating I was perfectly fine and the pain went away.

I've ridden alot in the beggining less than 10miles was crazy now I can pretty much rides all night for hours and hours 20-30 miles straight with no problems. 

Thing is your set up has alot to do with it. My Raptor 1 gave me the most fatigue only cause it was super crazy stiff I mean the most stiff board I've ever had it has 0 flex.

Now my Evo feels like a cloud cause deck has a slight amount of give to it. 

A Trampa should be plenty comfy but I suspect being in bindings hurts your feet cause you can't move around on the deck.

For some reason I get the feeling he was talking about his leg shaking from adrenaline and excitement not from fatigue

Ohhhh well i still get those adrenaline shakes from doing crazy stuff on my board haha.

Once I get used to the deck and it doesn't make me shake with excitement anymore I make something faster haha.
