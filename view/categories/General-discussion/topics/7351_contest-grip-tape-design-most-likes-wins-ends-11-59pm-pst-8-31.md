Oh the lowly grip tape..stepped on...dirtied...fore saken....



Post a GRIP TAPE DESIGN! And WIN!

The grip tape design can be: 
-on your deck 
-something you have drawn
-or some thing cool on the Internet 

You can only post TWO photos, but doesn't need to be in the same post. So, you can post one photo ... Then later you can post a 2nd photo at a later time. SO CHOOSE WISELY!
