There will be more Carvon owners out there building their own ride...Specifically V4 speed drives and torque drives and up...they‚Äôll be searching around looking for help or ideas....this will be a good place to start.

Well having nothing to tweak yet I'll speculate on what I'll be doing with my set..
A. 4WD, dual 6374 190 rear, v4 front 10S3P 25R, basically add to my current Zenith build 
B. 2WD, v4 rear, 12S1P TBD 21700, integrated enclosure carbon fiber deck, feather light speed demon üòã
F1 SuperFly on everything

I havent replaced my bearings on V3's so I cant provide a step by step. I also havent sourced bearings so cant tell their exact sizes or where to buy them Ill work on getting this info as it definatelynneed to know info. 

The Outer bearing is pretty easy, just remive the can screws, remove the can press out thrme bearing from the can. 

Inner bearing is more involved, but youd remove the collar screw and the fasteners retaining the stator to the collar. Separating the collar from the stator should give you access to thr inner bearing.

Thr hanger for V3's and V4's are the same. Its one of the fo forward thinking moves Jerry did when designing these setups. Since the axles can be replaced with longer, shorter, thicker, or thinner axles up to 12mm he can adapt a range of different sized motors to these hangers by changing the collar adaptor.

So I just took some laps around my block with 83mm wheels on the 4wd üò®.

I was thinking Id be sacrificing top speed for torque with the smaller wheels.....Umm think again. The board pulled to 42miles per hour with absolutely no sign slowing down.  I might have to go sweep my top speed testing strip tomorrow and find out what this these V3's can do lol.

When calculating the top speed for these things, does one fill in the same number for pulley and wheel teeth as it is a 1:1 drive?

Wondering if I maybe should go with a 10s4p instead of 12s3p because 50km/h is fast enough for me and I like the extra potential range.

## \#20 Posted by: Exiledd_Top Posted at: 2017-10-25T13:57:15.560Z Reads: 302

It's a 1:1 gearing ratio correct. If you have dual drive set up with 12s3p and ride about 23mph or below you can get about 20 miles ride aggressive and you get about 12-15 (alot of factors such as weight,riding style ,hills )

@BigBoyToys is 260lbs. He needs the 4wd if he wants to get up hills I guess. I'm still unsure what my plans are since I have almost no hills and don't plan to go any faster than 28mph. His build is just cool

I think one of the first bottlenecks is max regen. Need big charge rates in your packs if you want strong brakes to match the high top speed.

We get all winter to design and build, eh? :slight_smile:

## \#25 Posted by: BigBoyToys Posted at: 2017-10-25T17:38:38.571Z Reads: 283

```
I was 264lbs  this morning :), Im actually down 30lbs from 294lbs in July and aiming to get under 250 by New years.

My performance desires are a bit extreme by most people's standards but considering Im double the weight of many eboarders my power to weight ratio isnt that far above many of you guys(yet...stay tuned) Ie. My 135lb friend almost keeps up with my 4wd with a 2wd. 

Hill climbing is definitely part of why I use 4wd but in all honestly its speed and acceration that are most important to me. Hill climbing ability happens to come along for the ride.

I think a 4wd V4 torquedrives on 107's would really be an awesome ride, if someone doesnt make one soon I might have to lol. With the low KV it will also make good use of the amps you feed it for acceleration/regen and bigger wheels and extra motors will get it right up near their max no load speed where they run most efficiently. Close to 30mph Id guess. It would also be more efficient than the speed drives. We've already seen that my 4wd speed drive set up can get really good efficiency under light load cruising, Im curious how much better the torque drive would be with the low KV.

As for a belt/direct drive hybrid, I think its original and should be done for science lol. I think it would definitely be a better looking board than a 4wd belt drive with motors sticking out front and rear üòù. I wouldnt be surprised if it turned into a 4wd Speed drive in the future though as Im not sure the rear belt drive will offer anything that an extra pair of speed drives on the back wouldnt other than more torque off the line and reduced top speed. If you tried to match the gearing of the belt drive to the speed drives I think youd end up with very similar performance to having a 4wd speed drive set up but maybe at lower cost?

5 benjamins on hub motors that can run unmodified genuine abec11 flys, and you're looking at clones? I'd have thought the abec11 thane was a large part of why these motors are interesting.

Trucks, Carvon has the surfrodz tkp as the suggested upgrade. Might be a good place to start. Jerry's been money in all his advice to me so far.

With Carvons not really enough of a truck for their to be to much "Matching" to worry about. I got mine in black so I will order some Gullwings in black. I just want performance carving and turning at high speeds. 

I have this crazy idea of putting the V4 speeddrives on my exo when I get it. Torques in the rear speeddrives in front. I can't imagine a better setup.

Hi,

In other thread (since v3 are sold out) guys pointed me towards V4 on your website, just a quick round of questions:
- are those motors come with any adaptors for abec11 wheels ? if so can I use those with 107mm flywheel ?
- which abec11 107mm wheels use with those, standard ones or the cut down version that they have for supposedly e-skates?
- delivery / tax to UK.

Guys, 
https://carvonskates.com/products/carvon-v4-speeddrive
this link it states that V4 motors are 2500W (2.5 kW each) 

but if you will go here:
https://carvonskates.com/products/carvon-exo-only-749-right-now
it states that motors are 350W

Any comments ? I'm really confused now ... specially that I already got those in basket with a debit card burning the hole in my pocket.

Just 7.14 times difference in power ( 2500W / 350W ) seems a lot. Are you running speed drives in delta and torque drives in star configuration ? That's only how you could get a reasonable with that much less power.

It is just f$%^@ confusing ... 

and since while written stuff never can send a true meaning - I don't want to even remotely have a go at you, or sound if I'm questioning your stuff guys. I think it's great you provide stuff for DIY people with reasonable design approach - I would like to chose a right drives for my self, that's all. 

This is a general enquiry: 
Would it be a bit better to in terms of motors provide a torque curve and max ratings for motor ? kV is meaningless unless delta / star configuration is given, max power of 23452345 kW is meaning less if torque is flat with little stall torque -> and you can't climb the hill. 
There is a lot of data one can take out of torque curve ... for example is somebody want's to have a e-skate for bombing down the hills, a motor with a lot of power might be useless if torque at high rpm is negligible making it impossible to stop

So I have been riding on my Carvon v3 speed drive for 2 months and would like to offer some insider info in terms of setting these things up. 

1. Make a battery that can handle high amperage, it makes a big difference in acceleration and braking ability. I have a 12s4p LG HG2 battery pack with no bms, so I run the VESCs at 50 amps battery max for each. When I race my friend with a carvon evo complete, I run past him on acceleration like you wouldn't believe. The evos are limited to 25 amps per vesc (50 amp max on bms) and have a 12s3p samsung 30q battery pack.

2. My friend with the evo is running sensored FOC, I am not because one of my sensor wires is bad. We both went on an endurance run to test range, he got 25 miles of range, and I got closer to 30 miles.

3. With 90mm flywheels I have logged a top speed of 39mph, and with 97s I have logged a top speed of 40.8mph. I still want to see what speeds I can achieve downhill with proper bushings.

4. The bushings that come on the V3s are 85a cones and in my opinion not great for high speed skating at all. After researching downhill skating setups (bushing shape and durometer, and flat vs cupped washers), I decided to go with venom HPF double barrels front and back. **The issue** is that the barrels require a wider washer than cones, which interferes with the the motor on the truck hanger, limiting the turning ability of the truck. Here are some pictures for reference:

I am running BLDC and love it because of the sound. Here is a video of me accelerating from a low speed:

And for the people who want to roll in silence:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow0Tuz5P2Xg&ab_channel=DannyDeLeonardis

And yes I have better range because my pack is 12s4p (12AH) and the evo is 12s3p (9AH). My battery is also over a year old and I typically ride very aggressively, so I'm sure I could go a bit longer with new cells.

My friend has 40 pounds on me, but we have switched boards and mine still pulls ahead. The braking on mine is probably 25% more responsive, but braking on the evo is definitely sufficient, it can easily throw you off the board if you aren't ready.

config will be 12x3p should give theoretical 960A, which when low on SOC should give out at least 200A so I can feed 4wd in the future.


I know it's a deviation from graphene, but maybe I'll follow the path of less power efficient cells but more of them to give roughlyh the same power output as graphen ones for same cost but far better range

Anyway @Michaelinvegas I'm not sure whenever it was you guys but somebody claimed that they were in touch with vader because motors are based on XYZ motor which was used while designing vesc etc etc etc ....

I've looked through design of vest, tansistors, controller chip, step downs and all this crap and it looks to me as vecs is designed for up to 60V. I would like to get in touch with the guys because If one would to controls voltages properly on battery, by standard this inverter can cake 14S setup and if BMS would control max voltage and clamping motor regen current one could easily make this setup 15S.

DTC - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_torque_control 

FOC - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_control_(motor)

FOC is a subdomain of DTC. In Industry if you drive motor with square wave (lot of loss and noisy) you call it DTC, if you drive motor with nicely modulated voltage wave (that mostly looks like a sine) you call it FOC.

I don't think that would happen. It's too late since we are so used to it due to BLDC tool, I mean just look at what we get to choose from BLDC of FOC...there is no "DTC" option. Your attempt at correction is like how people say bullet instead of ammo or clip instead of magazine. I get it.

The XL Drives will give you 38.553705 MPH on 12S setup with 107 wheels .... in theory. It mostly depends how good is you battery pack if voltage sags to only 3V when you drain 140 A (2x 70A fo max power) you can make it. If you use 3 parallel 18650 you can forget getting anywhere near that.

For anybody considering a torque of motor, it's pretty simple:

This describes max torque motor can give:
T (torque) = I max (max motor current) / Kv 

This describes how much power motor gives. 
P (power) = I (amps) * V (voltage)

This desribes repation between power, torque and rpm:
P (power) = T (torque) * RPM.

It's common in the bussines to limit torque at the beginning because you could rip motor out of it's mounts of damage prop shaft or differential ... So at the begining you will see torque being limited to let's say 800 N/m and then you will see it dropping of due to power limit (torque to rpm relation) - which is caused by battery limit most of the time (sometimes heat rejection of motor)
https://qph.ec.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-97419c138fce4fa430e0f557be936df3
https://qph.ec.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-fd1a400759e06f006620d4d75789bd0b

So from what I've seen arround most of motors are pretty good, and vesc is pretty good as well but people cheap out on batteries and end up with power clamp from physical battery performance (or they set voltage limits for battery to low and damage battery resulting in 10 charge cycles to death or resulting in fire)

3.6V x 12 = 43.2V
43.2V x 85kV = 3672 RPM
3672 RPM x 107mm / 25.4mm/in * 3.14 = 48572in/min

48572in/min * 60 min/h / 63360 in/mile = 46mph

46mph under no load theoretical limit.

Where did you get 38mph limit from? 140A? You're assuming that you need 6kW to reach 35mph? Where did you get that from?

To properly characterize the motor limits we would also need Io and internal resistance which we don't have.

No, for calculating max power out of the pack for e-skate I take 3V for computing the speed - this is where you will get at 50% for most of packs that guys are using here.

0.2A 15A and 30A per cell curves for AWT vs VTC6:

Henrik also started incorporating temperature limits in his testing later on. Which is why you see the VTC6 discharge cycle stopped early for 30A

---

Either way, 3.0V/cell seems reasonable, I personally use 2.5V/cell as that is the lowest voltage I allow on my systems. I just didn't get what you meant the first time you said "battery pack if voltage sags to only 3V" and assumed it was a typo or something. I usually say 3V/cell or 36V battery voltage. 

Still, you are assuming it takes 5kW to get to said speed. I'm not sure that assumption is correct. I do not have an alternative though as I've never been that fast.

I know how to use discharge cycle charts, thanks! :)
To keep the conversation going, if I were to build a high speed board using Carvon SD XLs, I would use a 12S6P Samsung 30Q pack. They are about half the price of VTC6s and dont give up performance that much.

Henrik didn't test 30Qs at 30A so you cant use his graphs. Closest performing cell is VTC6. Either way, they can both provide 30A with roughly 0.6-0.7V drop per cell. (I have tested both cells and have my own set of curves for them)

@PXSS
How about I'll take the tone down of the conversation - I'm sorry I did not see your "under no load". AWT are better under temp, but yes they are rebrands. (I see you keep editing your post and it just see edits happening :X) Anyway, I would stick with the Henrik opinion that there are no true >20A 18650. 

Anyway I see that you get it as well. Peace!

ps. rule of thumb is for aredynamics from our experience is: over 30mph aerodynamics are horrible and you spend 2x power per every 10mph. You can kneel down etc, but there is another problem - at high rpm in permament magnet machines magnetic flux eats heavily in your power - so most manufacturers cut off RPM when you start loosing 10% of power, vesc doesn't seem to have that limit so will whack as much rpm as it can .... so when motor peaks out you can loose a LOT of power.

pss. If you look up on you tube some of vaders videos - early implementation of vesc he had while at full speed was draining 50A and limit was set to 50A. With more recent developments stuff I've seen around has limits of 70A so here is my assumption of 140A in 2WD setup while at full blast.

@PXSS 
How about different angle, when I assume 140A max current I personally would be not comfortable with putting more than 20A per cell (connectors, welds, internal wiring of cell in my mind is just asking for it) - so setup would require 12s7p setup. That's 84 cells. Given the lowest price I've seen around to those been 5¬£ people will shell out 420¬£ for a pack that can give 140A and has 21Ah ... considering some good ordering channels but still buying in small quantity I can drop price to 2.8¬£ but that's still small quantity (and I don't see purpose of using good favours for that type of stuff) that's still 235.2¬£ 

for 200¬£ I can get as many lipo's as I want, get twice the Ah if not more ... from your experience do you see any other reason to go for 18650 here rather than just inherent lack of safety of lipos ?

It does have a temp and power limit. I'm sure a foldback algorithm could be implemented as the temperature of the machine gets too high, since that by itself is an indication of a higher loss of efficiency, whether it comes from the magnets or the the ir of the coils.

I have built packs with VTC6 cells that draw up to 30A per cell continuously. We do have very good airflow to keep the cells under 60C. 

I have a VTC6 pack in 6P config that I have tested in lab at 130A continuously with no airflow. I think we managed 5 minutes with cells at 65C at the end of the test **with no airflow** (just sitting on a bench / not insulated though). The cells are of course welded to .02in thick copper plates like the ones below with 8 AWG wire on them.

I thought so too earlier today, but not quite... 4S 16Ah batteries run at about $230, 8Ah 4S runs at $99. The cheapest option I found was 5Ah 4S Lipo for 23.59. This is from Gens Ace, which is one of the few brands for Lipos that I trust. There might be cheaper options in hobbyking but I don't know how many times we've received doa packs from there. 

So if we go with the Gens Ace 5Ah 4S packs, we would need 15 for a 12S 20Ah pack or 12 for a 15Ah pack. That is $354 for 20Ah or $283 for 15Ah.

The only real reason why I personally stay away from LiPos is that I absolutely hate how bulky they are lol. That is my main gripe with them. Nothing else!

I understand their use for applications where more than 10-15C current draw is required, but anywhere else, I think Liions come out on top the downside being that you have to build your own pack or buy prebuilt for a stupid price tag. I dont think I have seen a decent pack with decent cells with less than a 50% markup.

That's the only valid for drag caused by frontal pressure. above 30mph you start including rear vehicle vacuum, over 50 you start including side friction from viscosity and above 70 mph you start computing all turbulent working on vehicle. I create lories so for me it's 56mph top and I don't have to worry about most of computing, neither customers care - they want cargo space ... of course we put effort in limiting front coefficient and rear vacuum ( by shaping the box to have a slope down) but there is only so much you can care about.
Hence up to 70mph I use this rule of thumb, over that everything goes out through the window.

[quote="PXSS, post:165, topic:36438"]

[/quote]
Don't worry I've got a guy that is a phd in darn things and he made a nice fancy spreadsheet for computing that. I'll ask him whenever he can give it out without NDA might be helpful for some.

PM vs SR motors:
- on pernament magnet - faster you go, the faster magnet passes you windings and that inducess currents that might work against your
- on switch reluctance motor - you induce magnetic filed in rotor so you can drive it int he fashion that makes it die off before even approaching next winding.

Anyway, to give you and example: we buy a system from some company (can't name them) and they clamp down motor at 9200rpm (9100 - 9200 is torque cut of point) WE run some numbers and it came out that their motor can go up to 12000 rpm before they will hit 30% loss on flux (and could easily do 11K) but their inverter did not had enough of switching frequency and they clamped it down on 9200 because it was where system was crossing 10% inefficiency on switching losses and not hitting sweet spot on the motor in term of when matching voltage wave to what motor needed. They could switch to DTC drive but then they would loose 10% across the rpm range due to waking it with  square wave.
On the other hand Switch Reluctant motors are not as bound by that problem because there are no magnets so you have to induce field via eddy current - but because of that you steer it how you like and with SR motor you have 6 set of winding so you have a lot more options ... you can easily spin those to 200.000rpm without breaking a sweat.

So going back to vesc - problem here is that everybody just take vecs, connect it to motor and drive it to red line ... motor will run at max rpm but you don't know how much you lost in power ... it only shows up under load where 20% actually adds up to a noticeable number (answer here is dyno, but for eskate - c'mon).
So if anybody would connect a "perfect battery" (no voltage drop, always any current you want) you could drive motor on bench to max Kv number. With the driver on it will completely different ball game - when at max speed areo drag + rolling drag > max motor power - % of losses = you will not achieve max speed. 

I know you know that :) But that's why when I would compute anything for my self I would consider that well made motors will do up to 80% rated rpm with less than 10% flux switching.

I came across someone who said that at 14s the voltage would be just below what the max power allowed is, so if you were to only charge your batteries to say 80% (which apperantly they said is also good for longevity of the batteries) to avoid voltage spikes, you could do this in theory.  Does anyone know any more about this possiblility?

Actually ever since it occurred to me that if you use 12S setup and start regen and allow 12x4.2V = 50.4V max voltage on battery bus (be advised that some lipo will let you go over that) you still need to account for the fact that to be able to put current to the battery you need to:
- induce higher voltage on the inverter side
- motor side actually runs in 3 phase so at maximum power transmission 50 V DC = (50 * square root of 2) 70.7 V peak to peak AC 
- inverter will produce very voltage with lot's of spikes, and I don't know whenever the controller rating is set for 60V continuous or 60V absolute at which internals will brownout on voltage going above 60V.

Unfortunately there is so much hardware manufacturer will put into a datasheet - you need to get test evidence to absolutely prove the design. 

So yeah, I wanted to get int touch with Vader to get his input of some of this stuff ... and 14S setups would help with few issues ...

Don't forget about inductor flyback in the motor feeding back-pressure into your circuit.  12S is already too much for the VESC circuit.  14S means face sliding on asphalt one day when you roast it because you're running it over its limits.  Most electrical engineers never put a component into service with more than 50% to 60% of its design voltage/amperage.  10S is already over that....

I don't think that the VESC and other RC controllers run DTC...
They only do six-step commutation (with current limiting on vesc).

The sensorless commutation only sets the point, where you switch.

Maybe this explains it a bit:
https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/bff9/23c74851f5dd9c76001f9db282b21314e823.pdf

The term BLDC mode comes from the earliest controll of brushless dc's. Only block commutation was done, and this kind of set the term. As far as I could read, DTC would be wrong, as it is an early effort increasing torque control in brushless applications!

Well, BLDC is name of the setup (BrushLess Direct Current), even the paper calls:
1. Six-Step for BLDC Motor Drive
2. DTC for BLDC Motor Drive
So even they specify that six-step and DTC are de-facto driving approach, while BLDC is a 3 phase motor with DC -> AC inverter setup. 

Now, to the inverter controller chip DRV8302 ... I've had a deeper dig into it and unless TI botched another data-sheet (not the first time) there is not flux sensing on this chip, so it's a pure switching driver. Fine by me, so the flux sensing is done somewhere else ... for example STM ? Now, on vecs website there is a statement:
"
_All of the hardware is ready for sensorless field-oriented control (FOC). Writing the software is the remaining part. However, I‚Äôm not sure if FOC will have many benefits for low inductance high-speed motors besides running a bit quieter. Sensored and sensorless FOC is fully implemented since FW 2.3._
"
which more or less indicates that there has to be flux sensing provided on the PCB ... without it how will you do FOC ? Which brings us to your data-sheet where is states that for DTC mode you need flux and torque estimation, all of which to me looks like it's done in vesc in mode called "BLDC"

If this inverter would be a pure six-step you would only have a 100% torque or nothing ... unless you implement voltage regulator / current limiter before six step inverter.
```

The current is simply controlled by pwm and current sense feedback. Simple 6-step commutation, as stated in the paper I gave you. 

Here you can see the commutation:
http://vedder.se/2014/08/startup-torque-on-sensorless-bldc-motors/

It really is as I told - believe me, I wouldn't tell if I weren't sure ;-)

DTC is ab early approach, and FOC is the "full distance". Benjamin did this, and implemented all features (current sensing for 2 phases) beforehand, knowing that there is the possibility of using it.

The cortex m4F is quite a powerful controller, and enables this method of driving. It was limited for vesc 4 in maximum RPM, and is now further expanded (as many already hit the limit).

If you buy a BLDC controller, and nothing else is stated, then it is 6 step 120¬∞ commutation. Easiest driving method, straight forward. Works considerably well with low effort. Think of Brushless cooling fans!

DTC is used in cheaper controllers, and will do the job well enough for most cases - I think you know it well. FOC on the other hand is the next step, but need more expensive controllers, and may be not worth the higher effort and costs.

Best regards 

Markus

Well, most of stuff you say makes sense ... still it sound as a crying shame that this controller was not started as DTC in the first place ... a straight jump to FOC seems like a jump from inventing the wheel to 4 wheel drive with torque vectoring (bypassing the invention and refinement of differential).

[edit] that's my lame "you are right" [/edit] 

Side note: actually it's the first time I heard six step, all the time for that time of control term used was "soft commutation" or just "switcher". 

Now in regards of FOC on vesc ... most of folks state not to use it ... what is the problem from your point of view ? 

Side note2: I've seen around here that lot's of hub motors and motors in general here have problems with heat rejection, at the beginning I was a bit surprised, but if all of those run in six-step (switcher) mode than there is lots of power being converted into heat inside the motor ... which make more sense now.

The problem with FOC is the higher speed of switching! This causes a lot of noise on the supply lines. This wouldn't be a problem at all, if the safe voltage range for the DRV was a bit higher. Due to very high power, people tend to use the higher battery voltages to reduce (battery) current. But this reduces the distance between the absolute maximum voltage and the supply voltage.
With the higher switching speed, and high RPM more and more voltage spikes hit the DRV, which slowly (sometimes faster) degrades. 

Problem is that this remaining voltage difference is so small, that crow-bars won't work any more. There aren't so sharp ones available (in small packages/designs). What helps, and these are the more "reliable" vescs, is adding higher capacities here and there, especially in the DC link. These should be high capacity AND low ESR one's, that they can react fast enough to smooth out the spikes. The more the manufacturer keeps on the original design (maytech for example), the more likely it fails. Other manufacturers just use higher rated parts. But the most problematic one stays (DRV). So putting in better parts only shifts the limit, but only in small quantities :-/

The VESC hits a limit here, and unfortunately the DRV is not available in a more voltage tolerant variant :-(
20 V more would do the job!

And regarding the hub motors - it's not the problem of six step, it just creates more torque ripple. It's just the absurd amount of current you put in :-D

These are airodrive motors, they are intended to be run with a large "fans" in front of them. Forcing air through the windings! And now we only rely on the circulation by turning the motor. No wonder it heats up! Even six step is quite efficient.

... hmmmmmm I actually checked the interweb and there are not many integrated drivers with reasonable voltage that quickly pop up in search. How about designing a custom driver & inverter stage ?

sied note: if voltage is the issue, we can always go for "unrealistically overkill transistors" and just drive the current curve for longer before we have a white flag day and jump higher in voltage. 

side note 2: What about the controller chip, the stuff on vesc is stated somewhere in data-sheet that it can do dual FOC control at ~45kHz (STM32F4xx). This could surely drop the final price for driving whole axle (and using common ground for 2 independent motors does help limit whacking the battery with high current noise)

We - a team of work colleagues - work on just such a controller. As we try to drive 10 kW, we had the white flag day in theory. Up to 250 A at 60 V are the goal. It just consists of a beefier power stage, but these high currents are quite a challenge! Every little resistance in the path kills voltage, creating a source of high thermal energy...
Cooling transistors with such high currents is a big challenge. Even small pieces of not super nice conducting material rises the temp to a point of no good. So we are on the way. Watercooling seems to be a good thing. Even for the motors. If you want to have high peak performance, you have to cool excess heat. So we can go with smaller motors, and peak high torque :slight_smile:

Watercooling
[/quote]
none of inverters that I work with come without water cooling :D thou on electric skateboard it's a no go. Just a random shot, but have you guys considered potting it ? we were looking into potting some of power electronics to make it dissipate over the large surface of the box but we managed do fmea out of it :P (but to be fare it was not motor power switching, just some other power control with constant ON states - like a solid state relays, very little loss) as a result we've found some potting resin material from 3M with K factor of ~7 (if my memory server me right) ... it's far from perfect but damn better than air !.

goin back to your solution ... 250 apms ... I'm not sure whenever this is your every day skate board material ... good thing about keeping below 100A is that wires are still acceptable for miniature application and you actually have an option of fusing the damn thing ... beyond 100 apms you are entering the crazy world of gigavac etc and as much as I hate to put HV into places where it shouldn't be, he I would say HV is your only option.


side note: of course you could be really mad and want to go that current, so for inverter stage I would suggest using split pi ... I came across this guys some time ago .. unfortunately they did not had any inverters that we wanted but a very interesting bit of kit that they have

:sweat_smile: it won't be a e-skate, but it uses some parts of it! I'm here because of news for the speed controller and experience for wheels.

Because actually we're going for 4 wheels drive. The front will consist of 2 hub motors - pretty easy to drive - and the back with 2 stronger ones. So actually we're going to have two of those motors! 
Batteries are ready for 500 A continuous, and we have some stuff already for all the security, such as high current fuses :blush:

We have background from our job for such stuff, so it was rather easy to get it.

Our goal was to overshoot a bit on the power side - and I think we managed that. Better safe than sorry!

Even though it is not a eskate - I can show the final solution when we are finished! Basically all things could be part of an e-skate, a powerful one :innocent:

You could definitely do that if your able to acquire a set of XL's.  One thing I would definitely DEFINITELY do, is contact LHB before he builds the board, tell him what your planning, so he could build you the 12s5p battery pack, as it'd be much easier to just have that from the beginning, rather then adding another 2p later.  I don't know if the 4WD option uses a larger enclosure, but you'd want to make sure you get that as well.  I don't know how long you plan to wait before upgrading, but that would be the best way to prep your board for the future upgrade.  Then once you are ready to make the change, I would send it back to LHB along with 2 VESC's, and the XL's, and he could finish the 4WD build for you.  That would be the best way to do it since he would dial in all 4 of your VESC's and that would keep the warranty in tact.  Of course you could do the upgrade yourself, wouldn't be too difficult.  Would just need to swap out the front trucks for the XL's, connect them to the VESC's.  I haven't had to setup a vesc yet so I don't know if you'd want to keep all the settings from the originals and make your new VESC's have the same settings.  Though I think since with the new motors you'd need to change things since the battery will be putting out power differently.  Then just put a splitter on your battery cables so they can go to the new motors.  And I'm sure there is a bunch of other stuff you could do, but that's mainly the hardware parts.  IMO I would just do what I said with LHB in having him set it up so it'll be able to transition to 4WD without much fuss.  Hope this helps :smile:

Hey @uigiroux! thanks for the suggestions! I was actually also thinking if I could contact @longhairedboy and have him configure it for a future 4WD upgrade! Though shipping will probably cost me more to do so then just purchase the 4WD straight up I think as I live in Asia.  

It's just difficult to bit the bullet on $3000 if I cant take it alittle offroading like on some flat dirt paths which I'd love to experience with Pneumatics. I was also considering the Lacroix board but it totals to about $3000 as well including shipping. I sent Carvon an email about the 4WD availability but no response yet. I'm seeing lots of posts about them being unable to respond or just being unresponsive for several reasons. Knowing when they'll have the 4WD available for purchase would help me in getting the budget for it together.

My advice, don't buy a $3k+ bespoke build overseas if you're not equipped to repair them yourself. No matter how good the build, eskates constantly shed parts and need TLC, especially if you ride hard. It will not be a zero maintenance item, with the burden increasing as you get more exotic (hub/DD, pneumatics, 4wd, crazy big packs).

I appreciate the advice as it is a very sound one though DIY all come from abroad as well and nobody actually makes completes/components in my country like Enertion or Carvon as those are shipped in as well. Would it be possible to keep it simple while learning how to maintain and give the TLC for these types of components? 

One reason I am opting for Carvon as its simpler as compared to other drive trains so less points of failure but ofcourse these have their own set of problems albeit less than other drive systems. This next purchase will very likely be my last as far as buying $1000+ builds/parts goes. Only thing I plan on buying after this are parts to keep it running.

I think the most middle of the road build, with parts that are least likely to die and easy to replace, will be dual 6355 190kv belt drive, dual vesc, about 15/36 ratio, 10s4p 30q pack. Everything will be running in the sweet spot, nothing close to the edge. There are many sources for all parts. And of course, build your own so you know how to fix it. :slight_smile:
 
I went the same way as you with my first build. It was like lego, so easy and so clean. But I beat the hell out of my lovely Carvons, and they're hard to get parts for or repair. One pothole and you might be completely up the creek and no paddle to be found.

If I could go back in time, I'd tell myself to build a belt drive, ride it for a year, then buy the Carvons when I know proper care and feeding for the boutique build.

Oh i see, I've been reading carvon related threads and posts and most of the time they appeared to hold up to the expected abuse from standard usage. I was planning  to ride majority of the time on the street or sidewalk but sure anything could happen. 

Curious as to what happened to your Carvons? I'm currently running an Ownboard W1 Pro but hasn't hit 100km yet and the hubs have already started to chip. I bought this board to test out if it would be a hobby I'd enjoy and I'm thankful that I did give it a try but it can ofcourse be a very expensive hobby so I don't want to keep worrying about all sorts of parts and consumables(hubs in my case)

 The V4's feel sort of closed source so I don't know how complex or difficult it is to repair, maintain down the road as it kinda feels like its sold as a closed system that you don't really have to open up anymore

You don't see much talk of it, as I think most people take it for granted, but as you've experienced with your Ownboard, things fall off :)

Electric skateboards are subjected to amazing amounts of abuse. When I think about the amount of torque on those tiny parts, I'm amazed they last this long. Typical builds are pulling 2x the power you can pull out of a wall socket (about 1500w in the US).

As you climb the quality ladder things fall apart less frequently. The less you thrash your board, and the more conservative your build, things last longer. But most people who ride a lot have been through a pile of parts.

Yes I'd like to get more quality parts for the price. I wasn't expecting too much from the Ownboard but its performed well so far its just a question of how far the hubs can go but I try and find the smoothest roads to ride on and break in the wheels. Is debris the biggest concern with the Carvons?

Maybe I could 3D print an extra casing on it somehow? difficult to say without holding one in person. I do get pretty OC about such expensive things but that tends to have them last longer lol I wouldn't want to spend on more Chinese Budget boards as I believe I'll eventually end up spending as much as other premium builds if they continue to fall of in quality early on.

As far as speed I have hit 25mph on my abec11 97mm wheels and the damn things still want to go faster, I'm working up to that lol. So I agree with above, whenever they become available I'd say go with the TorqueDrives.

just finished a build with SD-R drives and it's up and running but can't get the brakes right.

with satellite motors, i was able to set the "Max ERPM at Full Brake" setting to make the motor lock up approaching near zero speed.  so it'd be progressive braking then when it's almost nearly stopped the wheels would lock up.  this is a desirable characteristic for me since i can make the board stationary when not moving by hitting the brakes.

i can't get the carvons to do the same.  is there a setting i'm missing?

also, got the batt min at -60a and braking still feels weak compared to satellite motors.

Yup. With really high settings if I remember. Was with 107s which have least amount torque. Someone said they are using reverse as brakes? Maybe @Ackmaniac knows of weak braking solution

Yes weak brakes confirmed. 

I also have a problem where my motors get really hot. They have reached 91 Celsius. 

I‚Äôm running
60 motor max
-100 motor min
25 batt max
-12 batt min

I went 47kph top speed at 45 duty on 97mm and I weigh 80kg and the board itself weighs 10 kg. 

Just braking twice from this speed would overheat my sdr. I‚Äôm contemplating to remove the pu sleeves.

@LEVer

Is this normal or do I need to return these drives since they are defective. 

Even from low speed riding and braking a lot and then accelerating the drives overheat so I am thinking now that they are simply faulty.

I‚Äôm going to wait until I hear from Jerry if they are faulty or not. My guess is they are since they reach such high temps just from slow rides and braking. I hit the over temperature fault regularly just from some acceleration and braking.

Very interesting. Zoom in just before first fault. Motor current is negative, but battery current is zero. Feels like current can not flow to the battery, because battery is fully charged / does not accept charge. During same time both VESC and motor temp increase dramatically.

@rpasichnyk if you check this data you will see alot of times that battery current is 0 while I‚Äôm braking.  

I just looked a this record and I am getting more convinced that there is either a bms or vesc setting issue. 
You can see with this record which was on meepo hubs being the only difference next to vesc settings that I got -16 current min with less negative motor amps then on the carvon.

@LEVer I realise I may be mistaken and may come to conclusions too soon that they are faulty for this I apologize. It is not my intention. I‚Äôm just frustrated that I can‚Äôt use my drives properly yet and don‚Äôt have a solution. 

I think I might just try defaulting my vesc settings and start over. I am leaning more and more to that there might be some settings mistake since it looks like my batteries aren‚Äôt taking much of a charge from braking whilst with the meepo motor they got more negative current than with the sdr. 

Unless someone has a better idea?

i just left everything default with batt neg at -60a and brakes are pretty strong, just had to get use to how the carvons feel.

having other issues tho.

it's stuttering at takeoff and can't get rid of it.

moved remote receiver away from power lines, tried foc-sensored, foc-unsensored, bldc-hybrid, bldc-unsensored -- none of this gets rid of the stuttering at take off.

getting pretty frustrated with this thing.

@thisguyhere @Moros @sayekim

I've experienced basically everything you guys are talking about and want to share what I've learned. **My settings are 80 motor max - 100 motor min 25 battery on a 10s5p 30q and dual FOCBOX.**

- I rode my board to school it was 32-35C that day and my ride was about 6 km on flat slightly uphill maybe a 1-2% grade for a 0.5km stretch with some bridge overpasses that were to go over an 8 lane highway. After riding for 5km and stopping at the market to buy some lunch I touched my motors for half a second and noticed they were really really hot, sadly I didn't have a temperature gun but I would guess it would be what @sayekim reported in the 90C range. When I was done at the market 15 minutes later the drives felt a little cooler but still very warm, then after about another 3km I started to go up the slight hill that was a 1-2% grade and was pulling the throttle all the way down and noticed I was barely accelerating and I couldn't even make it up that hill... so I pulled over and felt the motors and nearly burned myself it was extremely hot I sat there for 20 minutes till they sorta cooled off then started on my commute again kick starting it and the throttle felt noticeably weaker than before, however, breaks worked fine. That same night I got home and took apart my board checking for anything that might have gone wrong causing the hot motor issue and 0 throttle and found of the white wire on the sensor broke (on the side connecting to the FOCBOX) so then I unplugged the sensor and ran sensorless. I also changed my remote from forward and break to just current since I was told that having the forward and reverse gives you better braking ability. The next day I went to a group ride in Irvine, CA with many others like the previous day it was a 32-35C, however, had a couple more hills and was a longer ride like 14km at the end of the ride after about 10 minutes of standing around @Mikenopolis felt my motors and agree they were still extremely hot stating they shouldn't be like that. Jerry was there and checked them out and diagnosed it as my 10s battery I should upgrade to 12s which I was not aware of when purchasing the drives. I also had this weird motor noise which ended up being a bearing in the drive. I repaired the sensor wire and then got my board up and running as I was taking a trip to SF this past weekend, when I got there I quickly realized I was going to have to walk down or take alternate routes as the SDR would not stop me on those hills. I did go up a couple hills in the 25-30% grade but had a good run up tackling them at the 32kph range and maxing out at the 48kph but I did get the 0 throttle issue I was talking about before sometimes halfway up a hill the board would just give out and I would fell it slowing down jump off and grab the board and start walking up the hills the motors were not hot at all I grabbed them and they felt relatively cool, so I guess it's not a heat issue? The same thing would happen on some flat spots and it sucked as a couple ACTON boards passed me... the thing that fathomed me was that ACTON and EXWAY had way more reliable climbing ability than my SDR as well as being able to safely break on those steep hills. Overall I'm pleased with my performance with my SDR as long as I'm going on a flat area or take hills going like 5kph (that's how I was able to survive SF basically going like 5kph down a hill and hoping I didn't get a red light as I would either barely stop or foot brake). I think I may have missed a couple things but covered the major stuff.

Okay I‚Äôve got some other ideas of what could be the cause that needs to be looked at. 

@Yecrtz has the sdr too but his don‚Äôt get hot. He is using firmware 3.38 on his focboxes. 
Here is some metr info from when he was first riding.   

![image|236x500](upload://A2SMFsWVP7y5H4eixVWiEA1YzmY.jpeg) 

@chris.hunt @ElskerShadow which firmware are you guys using?

The other thing is I used the perimetr app to first setup my motors via detection of motors first after reading them first in the app. 

I will try some testing tomorrow or rather today actually when it is light again. 

First I will try writing default values on the ackmaniac vesctool and then setting the focboxes up again in the tool and configurating the motors. 

If they still over heat I will go to 3.38 writing defaults again first and then setting it up again.

got some results tonight, upped the sensorless erpm value to 4000 for foc sensorless setup and the stuttering stopped, that's good at least.

haven't tested enough to check for heat buildup.

there's this clicking noise tho...not going to put any miles on it until it's worked out:

for those of you with the clicking. Did you guys add heat shrink to the flywheel adapter prongs?

Mine was quiet for about 20 miles and started making a clicking noise. Turns out it was because the sharp edges of the prongs were wearing out the flywheel's core/holes and there was a slight movement. I added heat shrink to them, put the wheel back on and the noise was gone. Maybe yours in not something as simple as this.

Both results are with these settings.

[quote="bandrews510, post:350, topic:36438"]
The higher the voltage the less losses there are, that‚Äôs why the voltage on transmission lines can often get up to 480V and sometimes even higher
[/quote]

in a power line yes but in a motor it's only the current that creates torque.  you can't make a cooler motor running a higher voltage battery.  what goes to the motor isnt the battery voltage but an "effective voltage" created by the esc.  It's stepped way down depending how fast yourr going.  the slower youre going the more it's stepped down. if you attached 50v to your motor, and your motor had a resistance of maybe 14 miliohms,  it would be ohm's law and a huge current and burn up

in fact if you run a higher voltage you're increasing the no-load speed and the motor will be more inefficient similar to running a high kv motor.  it has the same effect.  

in the power system wiring other than the motor it does work similar to power lines and is more efficient running higher voltage.

its good and get to remind myself and verbalize and hopefully someone will come along and tell me more. 

 tips and tricks... following the logic above it makes sense to have super fat motor wires as when the esc does it's stepping down of voltage at low speed it's often stepping the current way up, so the battery may only be putting out 2 amps through the battery leads to the esc but then from the esc to the motor, depending on the esc settings, you could have up to 100 amps there and if you want to be efficient fatter wires there is more appropriate.   And the fat motor leads work as a heat sink for the true motor wires as they are thinner with more resistance and hotter.
worth upping the motor amp limit to 100 with a direct drive and hugely increases slow speed torque/performance and smoothness.
ive also heard from someone who had carvon motors that were clicking that he was sure it was his bearing.

100 amps is within the design limits and if the vesc is any good it should be able to do it.  especially with a hub or direct drive its worth taking advantage of.  the ride is much nicer.

Nice! I was planning on picking up a dual ESCape or Focbox for a carvon v4TD. Hope it won‚Äôt heat the motors too much if I go near 100amps.

When you mean nicer ride do you mean in terms of smoother take off and braking?

in my experience at 100 motor amps i get less cogging and can take off from pretty much a standstill smoothly.   and better slow speed acceleration.

I never had thermal throttling issue Other my V3 now I hit 84¬∞ in 3 minutes and no acceleration. I tried to raise the thermal throttling temperature but I don't know why it keeps reducing power at 83¬∞

We definitely need to find a solution, I have 2 units with overheating problems plus one of them has a faulty motors, I regret my V3 so much.

Does anyone know how to contact Jerry about the speed drive XLs? I would like to take @MrHappy‚Äôs spot on the XL list but need to contact Jerry so that he can confirm that I can take his spot. We‚Äôve tried emailing him about it but no response unfortunately.

Also is it possible to use the SDXLs on 10s instead of the 12s? I don't really need to go that fast but I just like the torque. I've already got a 10s5p pack made with a 10s bms and would suck to have to reconfigure the pack and get a new bms to go 12s to use the SDRs or SDXLs :disappointed_relieved:

Could just be the _beta_ value of the thermistor is off. (This is a setting in the vesctool) So the motor may be cooler than the read data.

Contact Kyle if you want to buy this from him

Soooo. Kyle @kylem21 wants to back out of the V4 I sold and shipped to him a day after I shipped it out, I basically said no because it's already out of my hands and told him to sell it. It's currently on it's way to him from CA to RI. It should be in his hands by Tuesday July 31st 2018

This is the video I recorded when I took it off the Raptor, the split in the urethane sleeve shown is cosmetic and the entire sleeve is just glued down according to Jerry. 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTbg-j9o7Kc

(from my original post)
-CarvOn V4 SD (with urethane sleeve) - roughly 60 miles on them. Sensor wires are extended by soldering (as opposed to using an extension). Phase wires are 5.5mm because the VescX I use had that size connector. It‚Äôs been running smooth and quiet in FOC.

I've included six adapters I made that converts the 5.5mm bullets to 3.5mm bullets that are on the FocBoxes. This board has been through two rides from my house to the office (11 miles each) and two group rides (10 miles each) and then a bunch of up and down the block testing which is why I know how many miles they've been used. It's only been on dry smooth bike lanes.

This was originally posted here and Kyle's $650 offer made me parted it out:

You may wanna consider gear drives as well as I've read that the SDRs have had kinda weak brakes.

I already have a koowheel gen2 'kooboard' and its been rock solid for me and my plan is to just mount the carvon straight on the the kooboard as it uses the same connector and motor.

the question I have is whether to go genuine abec 97mm or 107mm.

Yeah these fly off the shelves likely due to the updates to address the heating of the previous version. I think there are alot of others who are also waiting to build 4WDs on these.

A LY Evo, enclosure from @Eboosted, if 2WD get front trucks from Surf Rodz and some ABEC 11 in 97mm or 107mm, get a 12s3p for 2WD and 12s5p for 4WD, the exact type of VESC I am unsure what it is, but I'd say either get a few FOCBOX's, or ESCape's, or the FS-ESC-6-6, bestech BMS, and you have the EXACT kit, probably for many hundreds less too :wink:

The solution from @LEVer who got it from someone else is to put heatshrink on the prongs if you have the mbs/clone adaptor for the torquedrives. This does not work for me. 
They always let go and then I do them again and after one ride they let go again.

![image|666x500](upload://wxPptPRnsODFLnV4vVpgFarckNU.jpeg) This happened to me too, I ended up redoing it 3 times even with marine grade with adhesive heatshrink  and finally I roughed up the tines a little to try and keep it from "walking" back off. It seems to be holding now. Thing is it is not a symmetrically a larger opening on the abec 11's. there is more gap in the inner section where the tabs are and less on the outer curved part. The tabs on the inner opening also tend to want to cut the heatshrink unless you really hold it to the corresponding cutout while it is still hot.

You are fortunate, I have had to redo it a bunch. I have a ton of heat shrink at work and am pretty familiar with its application, I am not saying it could not be user error, but I kinda doubt it at this point. To be fair the board does get ridden hard, my commute is nearly full speed the whole way with a couple long sweeping turns. Lots of bumps and cracks and some heavy breaking points.

Lastly. This is off topic, but I just got an update from the Backfire Ranger X1 I backed on Indigogo. Now these guys may make some questionable boards in the past, but they sure know how to give proper updates.

Hey, got a decent ride in yesterday.

My settings are as follows:

100A/-100A on battery current

then

60/-40 on motor current on all 4 focboxes.

Control is Current No Reverse With Brake

Battery is a 12S8P with Samsung 30Q cells. Top mounted with no BMS. It's actually 2 6S batteries connected in series. This way I can use a 2 channel smart charger to charge both batteries at the same time.

I'm using a gt2b with the mad monkey mod by @FLATLINEcustoms. Highly recommended with a build like this. Need the longer throw, Nano style remotes aren't granular enough for the power output.

So, I did not have this issue until I tried a certain combination of bearings, spacers and wheels for some reason.  When you bolt everything down tightly, and even with heatshrink applied to prongs you are able to hold the XL can in one hand and the wheel in the other and still wobble it back and forth loosely in hands.  Not the greatest solution, but I used a slightly shorter spacer INSIDE the wheel which allowed the wheel core itself to press against the XL lightly enough to hold it from wobbling but not create drag etc.  Blasphemy some would say, but it solved the prong fit issue enough (by shifting the problem elsewhere lol) for me.

First flaw found. 
Wheel spacer is the wrong size. (At least for Abec11)

In the picture below you can see my zealous bearings with included spacers vs the bearings/spacers that are included with SDXL. 

![image|375x500](upload://wYQf2iOOUXWpzpTFRl3omAq8TY0.jpeg) 

The zealous bearings fit the abec 11 perfectly with maybe .1mm worth of axial play while the carvon spacers keep the bearings too far apart and therefore add extra play.

I did not expect the SDXL to come with any bearings/spacers so I was pleasantly surprised when I saw they were included. Alas the spacer is too long but given that I was going to buy seismic bearings anyways, it's not a setback. 

If I were to use the bearings included, I would get some shorter spacers or cut the ones included on a lathe.

I haven't received my TD drives yet what does the adapter look like for those. I wonder if the lx and the SDR share the same adapter looks like it. I don't care for abec anymore myself. Abec is not what they use to be. Otang has by far better thane and there is a lot of ppl are making a kegal core wheel most likely better then the Chinese adec clone and you can get even better with seismic wheel which ppl are totally blind too. He might be a lil on the off side but HIS skate gear breaks world records for a reason..

I haven't got the exact measurements of the can. 70mm to 73mm I'd say is fairly close ..but I have 83 abec clone and they are getting real tight when I test fitted them lil while back. when I finally get a 85 mm kegels or speed vent adapter I'll be running no sleeve for extra cooling and more clearance as Jerry was saying in one of the threads with the heat issue that it's fine with no sleeve like the v3 had none. these can are his thickest can out of all the versions I think he said 3mm or 3.5mm thick and fliess bullet proof DD has a 5mm can I think his are and he drives on gravel roads I'm sure I'll be fine as I'm on this falcon now and I don't take it unless it wide and open with nice clean roads or bike trails

High performance Lipo all the way. Then you can set the breaks up good and strong the battery can handle a 25 to 30amp charge if I want to really fast charge i can. but for Regen its amazing it really charges the pack when breaking with setting up high and breaks are even better now I find.. torque,breaks and the power off the line is all there now it was lil weak before never botherd me as I'm use to no motors and other then the mid power band was always there but it's actually mind blowing how much better it feels with real power there at all times right to 40 35%. No sag 0.2v on flats full out..and .5v to 1v when battery is about 40%. It climbs up 15%incline gaining speed hard I can only get it to 55kmh before I back off. I have to try new bushing set up..or really tuck it ..but there is alot of throttle left its still touchy at those speed it just want to GO fast and I don't have the balls yet..

I fully understand where you are coming from. But from a long time trick pushing street skater and DH skater for 24 years which I have some friends that made it pretty far now  one ride for landyatchz..I just find the big wheels outta place for me unless your ridding volcano roads lol..I do  have some and they roll over everything not gonna argue that. But they feel like bouncy balls the black 74a reflys in the fall and spring  and in the summer they seem to sound like they are melting and so much more roll resistance then otang or seismic ..now these are smaller wheels so tough to actually compare.  but from what I've experienced in bigger wheels from trick to DH which was huge sizing difference they are harder to push but they roll forever and don't slow down until I'm going up hill or put my foot down..a thing I find is that on a flat perfect road or trail the wheels wobble a bit which then get onto play with these massive trucks 11inch wide and then the violent speed wobble occur which why real  precision truck for DH have gone much smaller which will make it easier to gain control when in that wonderful high speed wobble occurs.. grab a carve to pull you out. Anyways I just find the really good skate stuff ppl here are blind to I think..I have to say that abec now caters to the eskate world not where he originally came from the DH and slolom racing this is why he has the massive wheels now..my friends that know him which some of them use to be sponsered by him.. he had amazing stuff in the day I just find now and so do my friends that it's not so balenced and it very heavy thane he is using now. the china clones are identical I'd say. I have red 97 too I cant tell the difference both wobble  at high speeds smooth slow.. I have green 83 abecs that don't wobble but I swear are heavier then my 85 otang and then 85 Seismics are even lighter then both I have to get my old weed scale out to see but I swear I can feel it.. anyways not trying to offend any one. Its just personal preference and from what I know and have had.ill be buying ollin boards Cronin set up with his popcas for sure to try out. That is a sick set up this spring hopefully I have subsonic still wanting to work with me to build a custom eskate deck  with the spirit. Gonna be pricey build but

So I did a bit of machine shop searching today. Some of them were quoting really high stupid prices. We're talking $300 a set. I finally found a place that I trust and will get them done for the following prices:

5 sets: $144.31 ea
10 sets: $116.58 ea
15 sets: $111.40 ea
20 sets: $105.87 ea
25 sets: $102.62 ea
(A set means 2 adapters for a dual drive setup) 

If I simplify the parts to something more like what comes originally with the drives we get the following:

5 sets: $130.62 ea
10 sets: $106.86 ea
15 sets: $103.69 ea
20 sets: $99.35 ea
25 sets: $96.40 ea

Here are the two designs side by side:

![sceen%20capture%202|690x311](upload://yEgE1ZuhRvfjSUd7SxSMb2GIxVH.jpeg)
---

@Frenchy: a single set runs at $248 and $265 for the simplified and full version respectively, if you really wanted to get a set for the Seismic wheels.

---
I think we should aim at a minimum of 10 sets to keep the costs lower. Turn around time on these parts is 10 days from the day of ordering.

I will contact another shop that usually gives me really good prices on bulk quantities but they usually take a month to turn around things since they are pretty busy all the time.

These prices would be for the adapter only... I still need to find a place to do the motor shields (for the parts where the PU sleeve doesn't cover). If I'm not mistaken only the XLs have a partial shield and even then not everyone has them. I'm hoping these will be relatively cheap to manufacture.

I think I found ashop overseas that will do them alot cheaper. Will keep you guys posted. 

If we get to 20 sets, prices could be as low as $60 a set. I think I found the place!

Edit: here is the quote!
Lead time 2-3weeks

Prices:
10 sets at $81
15 sets at $73
20 sets at $64
25 sets at $59.5

Cheap ones are pretty accurate, but the nice ones are much nicer to use. For example my harbor freights, the battery was half dead every time I dug it out of the drawer. The Mitutoyos apparently run on mystic energy. Doesn't make a difference if you leave it on.

iGaging's absolute series seem a decent compromise.

I also like the plastic ones, comes in a 6 pack, can throw them around lose them etc, can measure live electric stuff, accurate enough for 99% of what I do.

Just so we're all on the same page. 
I am currently only doing ABEC11 adapters. I will expand to kegel and seismic after the first batch but I would like to keep focus on the ABEC11 adapters for now. I will send out a PM to those interested and start a list to confirm who is interested in the abec11 right now. 

What is stopping me from doing kegel adapters right now is that I dont ride them and don't own any of their wheels. So I don't want to design something and send it out to manufacture if I cannot test it first.

I own both mitutoyo and iGaging and most of the time just use the iGaging. Treat them with care and they will remain perfectly accurate. If you need more accuracy than 0.001" then you should use a good micrometer and not calipers.

I have this problem too, over and over ;)

I actually prefer dial calipers (Brown & Sharpe black face), but for the cursed 3d printer the Mitutoyo has taken over.

I also went on a ebay hunt for Starrett Master Vernier Calipers. A steal compared to the original prices, and it's functional art.

This sort of stuff.

Please fill out this survey!
https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/2SKZQB3

I'll start a google doc to keep track of orders. I think I will accept orders until next friday at which point I will tally them up and send them to fab! Turn around is 3 weeks from the machine shop and 1 week after that they'll be in your hands! You will see a link here later!


Payment will be due when monday 12  to fab as they require 50% deposit and 50% upon shipping.

Delivery date is probably around last week of November!

```

---
## \#549 Posted by: PXSS Posted at: 2018-11-02T06:13:11.475Z Reads: 112

```
I believe the recommendation was for the TDs as they have a larger diameter. (76mm vs 69mm)
I think you can get away with 90mm wheels if you have smooths roads and dont need a lot of clearance.

Other's opinions are probably more valuable than mine though as I will use my XLs with 97mm wheels.

---

Here is what the adapter CAD currently looks like. I had to make it swiss cheese so that the air vents on the TDs still get some flow... Not a huge fan of the look but I think some will find it appealing!

Maybe. I may buy a second batch of abec11 adapters later on but prices will definitely be higher as we are getting a really good deal by buying so many. I don't think we'll be able to round up this many people next time. I also don't intend to buy any more carvon dds myself so I won't have a need for any more adapters personally. 

The next batch is kegel, and then the third batch will be seismic speed vents for frenchy. 

If the demand is there, I won't ignore it. I just don't think we will get prices this good.

I'm waiting on the TD groupbuy, too.. but I also have an exo pro (pre- psychotiller battery/enclosure :roll_eyes:) and the drives definitely need and deserve a proper adapter for ABEC11s at the very least - that's why I'm going in for two sets :slight_smile:

One day @LEVer will deliver those drives :pray:

I'm feeling the same way i have a speeddrive now and two TD drive coming SOON I HOPE.. So three drives as of but I'll be buying like 4or 5 sets two kegel two seismic and one of these abec even tho I have the original abec and his newer fancy protection abec clone adapter also but that's just for the speeddrive and speeddrive xl. The new one will work on all three drives sweet shit right there. So to have a variety of wheels to choose from and if I decide to find another speeddrive I can do a 4wd with it and still have the choice to what wheels I feel like that day ..

Here is a video that was sent to me. 
If your drives dont have this issue, you don't need the adapter. The adapter I designed, fits real abecs snug so won't have this issue. 

https://youtu.be/f9MQPOJl-xg

@Mikenopolis said his fit tight initially but became loose as the prongs sharpness wore out the wheel core.  This was addressed in my design by chamfering the edges of the prongs but by also making them a lot longer. The prongs are the length of the core so the wheels ride completely on the smooth sides and not on any edges. 

The adapters fit all three drives so you don't have to get new adapters if you switch from SD to TD. 

My adapters will also fit 36T+ pulleys that I'm designing so you don't have to wait until you get the drives to put them to use. 

Thanks!

I agree that the kegel core is good, but not a fan of kegels themselves.  I cant say the kegel core is any better than the flywheel core as I've never had a core failure on either.  Clones on the other hand, I've thrown a few of them away because the cores deformed over time.

@Mikenopolis and @SeanHacker
Making the R2 hubs into DD style system might not be possible from a structural standpoint. The issue arises from the wheel being supported mainly by the spokes and not an axle. This would place a moment on the motors which they are not designed for as the bearings in them are not meant to take any axial loads. 

Moreover, placing wheels far out puts the load way further than the motors (and trucks) were designed for. Given that the R2s already saw some axle failures, I wouldn't be surprised if attaching a wheel that far out doesn't exacerbate the issue.

v4 SD-R/XL OD is 63mm or 69 with the urethane sleeve. TDs are 66mm od or 76mm od with the sleeve.

Going anything smaller than 80mm wheels is playing with fire....
Although I think I can make a carvon adapter that will fit **all** Seismic wheels regardless of the core. That would give you the option to go smaller if you would like.

I think I have the first revision ready for seismic wheels!
I ended up not using the speed vents at all. There is an outer set of grooves just deep enough to grab on to. The cool thing about this is that you can't even see the adapter from the outside of the wheels. The adapter ends up being very minimal and light (45g). It's also pretty short in height making it cheaper to machine. My only concern is that the core is only engaged on a few mm thick spokes, so with time these might wear down even with the chamfered edges on the adapter. I will be making a second style next weekend using the speed vent holes.

I am printing a set tonight and we'll see how they turn out tomorrow.

Does anyone know how to get access to the bearing in the fan wheel on the V3s? It's the bearing that's completely inside of the motor and closest to the truck. I took the single long silver bolt out of what looked like a motor clamp between the motor and truck. Since few careful taps with a rubber mallet didn't get it to move and there's no play at all I decided to stop and ask to see what I'm missing before doing something I'm going to regret. I've already contacted Jerry for warranty and repeatedly. He's great at selling and makes a damn good motor but not so good at everything else that's needed. I don't want to start a Jerry bashing chain,I just don't want to let him get away with it entirely. 

Before I forget the Carvon V3 outer bearing, closest to the wheel, is a 6900 10x22x6mm. I'll post up the inner bearing size as soon as I can get to it.

As always I love this place and I'm glad you're all here. I don't know what I'd do without you. Happy holidays and Happy New Year.

Does the Speed Drive R v4 not use a Liquid 50 degree base plate like I thought it did? I am sure it uses a modified Liquid hanger and logic would dictate it is paired with a matching base plate but the pivot cups that are supposed to fit this cup are too large in diameter to fit in. 

After a bit of research it looks like the pivot in pictures of a very similar looking Liquid hanger is slightly different than the Carvon one. I also found a post stating it fits caliber base plates without issue? I'll look closer when I get home but figured I'd ask what other people know about it.
