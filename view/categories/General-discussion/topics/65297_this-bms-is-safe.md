Are you going to use it both for charge and discharge?

Than no.
Max discharge is 20-40a. Usually 60-80a discharge is required if you want to use it not only for charging.

PS: you read that you can program this bms only with a separate usb stick with is only 199$....ðŸ˜‚

I didnâ€™t read everything. My question is just which configuration they sell. How you want or they have factory settings? If you then get a 5s bms for your 12s application... ðŸ¤” than it would be even not good for charging only.

if you want a programmable bms order one from bestech, the tools to program it are pretty cheap like 5$ i think
and you get all the software for free

DidnÂ´t know that. What can you change with that tool? parameters etc? How do you connect to the bms?
