I'm working with @DarkVortex to make a robot with a 4s1p battery, would we still need a BMS for something that small or can we skip it and just use a charger?

If we need it what are thoughts on these items

If your using batteries you need a BMS. If you can charge to 95% and discharge to no more than 30% everytime you are ok for a few charge cycles, then you need to balance charge manually. A BMS makes life a lot easier.

This is entirely up to you as a design choice. Personally I find it easier to build in a BMS just so you don't have to bother carrying around and hooking up a balance charger, but I've done both. 

I recently built out a 4S8P pack for a friend who is building a hexapod- using a similar BMS to what you picked out there. Charging just requires a CC/CV charger intended for li-ion/lipo.
