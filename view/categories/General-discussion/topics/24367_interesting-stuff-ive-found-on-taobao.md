Spent some time looking around taobao for esk8 stuff, thought I'd share my findings. Have you guys found any interesting esk8 stuff on taobao? Please share your findings if you have!

Dual motor kit - $130 USD
I know the mounting system has problems, can be solved by drilling holes into trucks then threading the hole with same size as the screw in the mounting plate then screwing straight into truck.

Dual mounting kit - $72 USD @Baz_L used this in his build 
Same mounting issue as above, mounting plate will slip if  you don't put a hole into the truck, easily solved.

Be aware of the bamboo deck! I saw someone's thread where a Chinese bamboo deck broke

For the price, I would just buy one and jump up and down on it like a trampoline to see if it breaks :stuck_out_tongue:

Also, in that photo you can see clearly that all sections of that deck are bamboo (you can see the little dots). I linked that store specifically because they specialize in bamboo.

I don't think @Davey is saying it's not bamboo. He was mentioning that on another thread the OP bought a bamboo deck from taobao, and it broke, right down the edge in the middle. I also second what he is saying because I read that same thread , just be careful.

Yeah, I've read that thread too. It was the vanguard clone, different deck from a different store.

Thinking about the same thing. Those "Crazy spring loaded truck risers" look interesting. I wonder if they are any good...

Thanks

hong Kong guy here :smiley:
The ones with the name box has some good stuff
There pulley system is a bit loosen , maybe it's just me. 
I fixed it with a tensioner and now it works fine.
The remote and hub combo pack is using winning remote, not sure if they are from winning or not but the remote is quite good :) 
I assume the hubs are the same as @torqueboards , which should from the same factory

Hi, 

I am going to HK soon and I was wondering, is it worth it to look for shops to get parts for electric or non-electric longboard? Or maybe the best deals are on Taobao?

Also, is there a Taobao seller you would recommend for belts? I have found a few but I don't know if they are durable and would withstand the use on electric skateboard.

I buy the set from ‘box’ so I don’t know about the belt . I could ask the local belt shop if they have any but you want in stock
Ps local shops are still way cheaper than alibaba xd

HK don’t have much electric part or non electric part. Sadly hk isn’t much of a skate friendly place, however taobow is a good place to visit ;)

Local skateboard shops buy board from taobao too haha

Hi Thanks for the info. If that is not too much trouble it would be great to know if your belt supplier has 12mm wide htd5m in 255 and 265 length. And also the address.
