woah that looks so interesting! should make the manual process of winding way easier. wonder how big of a stator it can support(only watched the first few mins before the parts breakdown)

hardly automatic though and you have to sit there and adjust for each tooth and the teeth have a really big gap between them which make it doable and sadly wouldnt fit most of our stators.
