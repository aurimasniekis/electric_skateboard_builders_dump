I thought it would be nice to have a thread where we can post up basic info about ourselves, so we know where everyone is located, what we do for work, and what other hobbies or skills we have. It would be great to know if there are other members close to us that we could actually meet, ride or converse with, and also if there are resident experts in certain fields that might be able to provide insight or information for questions we may have.  If there is any other information that should be added to this thread, please let me know.

28yo, London, UK

Software developer, specialized in web, mobile development (ruby+js) and digital currencies / distributed consensus systems.

Hobbies: Other than esk8, building 3d printers, shooting and editing videos, snowboarding and open source development.


I have 2 e-boards, my gf goes very slow and she's afraid of basically anything so it's not super-fun to ride with her. If you are in London, even if you don't have a board we can go esk8 somewhere, I would like to shoot some footage/videos of an esk8 ride from an esk8. If you're interested, please PM. Thanks!

Other hobbies: Basketball, Soccer, Gymnastics, Cycling, Graphic Design, Maths, I am trying to learn to code (I know a bit of html and python), Food (Not really a hobby, but who doesn't love nice food?), When I was first introduced into esk8 I started to like DIY, now everything that I need is DIY, except for stuff that I don't have the equipment to make.

I have one eboard (The Geminon), it goes 23-25kmh when fully charged. I am building another one that will kind of look like @runplayback and should go 35-40kmh (I can finally race my next-door neighhbour who has an evolve. When my second board is finished, I may sell my other board to someone or salvage the parts for something else.

Location: 28 yo, NYC, USA

Occupation: Occupational Therapist & Venture Capitalist Financier. I don't see much patients anymore since my other job takes up most of my schedule. 

Hobbies: Traveling, any diving sports, snowboarding, jogging, working out, hiking and now, eskating.  

I used to have 2 boards, the Yuneec Ego and the Boosted Board. Both board's rotors have since burned out beyond their warranty period. I just closed a deal on a DIY board so hopefully I'll have it by early June and I've place an order on the Enertion Raptor. Hoping to use the boards to commute across the city. I have no plans to build a DIY myself but will probably commission someone to help build one for me from scratch eventually since I don't have the knowledge or the time to do it myself. Hoping to ride with someone from downtown to uptown. Or if anyone is in town lets skate together and I'll buy you a couple of rounds!

I like traveling, usually every other weekend I'll go on a quick trip on one of the <2hr flights to a surrounding city...I think having an electric board is gonna be awesome for traveling, especially while there's no real verification of battery capacities at airports yet.

found the way @lox897 originally mentioned it to be kinda creepy, but in hindsight it really isn't that bad. I'll give him credit for what he tried to start before, and I so unjustly shot down :wink:

so I won't go into details, but I'm 16 and just spend my money on stupid shit- lets leave it at that.

Lol it was kinda creepy...

I think it was because he's 13....(no offense @lox897 üëäüèª) 

Coming from an adult, initiating the conversation, people feel a bit more comfortable...

@Mobutusan had a good approach (although I mocked him...lol)...and there has been tons of activity on the site the last few weeks...more regulars, hence a larger core of users ... And we seem to be interacting a lot...

Anyway....

But I've been other things in between ...head of social media for a casino property, the voice of that same property, vp of sales for an ISP .... I even worked in HR as an HR coordinator...I did all the new hire orientation Lol...and so far being Mr.Mom has been my biggest challenge lol 

Hobbies: Duh this .....I have a few builds under my belt and a couple of more when I get around to it... Not so much anymore but snowboarding & motorcycles & anything that would probably give people white hairs ... Of course now with the kids ... I gotta cool it a little 

Hit me up if you are ever in Vegas...if we can make it happen .... let's go skate ! ü§òüèªüòúü§òüèª

I'm from Minneapolis, just turned 22 recently and I am a computer tech for a local school district. Live with my GF who is a music teacher. We go camping sometimes, last trip was in early january, the weekend that it got down to -20 something. Went up north to cascade river state park (past lutsen mountain) couldn't cook our food on our stove or campfire since it was so cold. Went hiking/snowshoeing, wanted to go on the gondola at lutsen but it was too cold and they were not running it. I'm a fairly avid gamer, saving up for a VIVE right now (luckily my computer is already beefy enough that I don't have to upgrade it). Build stuff in my spare time, decent with MIG welding, beginner with TIG, and a master at soldering :stuck_out_tongue:

Besides all that, I'm a fairly boring :slight_smile:

I'm out of DC. I'm a medical intern for a few more weeks, early 30s, riding my board to work every day.  I have a background in military legal and IT. 

When I'm not slaving away at work, I'm tinkering with boards. 

Always down for a ride if anyone in the area wants to meet up and compare boards. 

I have boosted d+ (x2), evolve bamboo with AT, an enertion dual raptor yet to be assembled, a shitty import "falcon" board from eBay, a partial diy board with munkey boards battery and motor with Evolve at trucks/motor mount. I have hubs in the mail from all three reputable makers here. Eager to see how they ride. 

I'm probably going to loose my apartment deposit for carpet grease stains and aluminum shavings  stuck in my carpet from eboard work.

When I do get stuck Having to drive in DC/Maryland , I drive the fuck out my 370z.

I'm 39 and am an incredibly attractive guy with long beautiful hair. Everyone just calm down and stop fighting over me; i'm not available. I'm really sorry but somebody already trapped me in a domestic relationship. 

i work 8 hours a day in a cubicle hammering away on a macbook pro for a non-profit organization as a web developer/dev ops/linux guy, then go home and spend a couple hours with my awesome son and my lovely woman and then i'm in the garage till around midnight usually. literally everything i do in there is on instagram, and then it usually ends up here. 

when i DO have free time and i'm not playing with my son, playing with my boards, or teaching my son how to play with my boards, i'm into video games and playing/recording music. My son like EDM and death metal right now, so his favorite thing at the moment is when i turn on spotify EDM radio and jam along over what can only be described as incredibly predictable music that never seems to change key, so its a lot of fun turning this week's dance remix of your favorite pop song into a metal show for my 1.5 year old who asks for me to play like this while pointing to my amp: "uh? uh? ah?

It used to be motorcycles, but since my sons came along it felt safer to build longboards that go way too fast.

Job: I'm an attorney for an IT services and software company. I joined the company when we were 5 people, now we're 35+ people. So, I really enjoy seeing the entrepreneurship on this forum and empathize a lot with some of the growing pains I see - in general I'm really impressed by how ethical most of the practices are. Starting and growing a company is hard, it's like trying to build a high rise while it's on fire.

Location: Orlando FL most of the time for school, and Melbourne Beach FL the rest of the time

Occupation: VESC and other electronic repairs (previously a board level technician at an electronics repair shop before quitting for school)

Hobbies: Esk8 obviously, VESC repairs (so I can spend money on better microsoldering equipment that I don't really need, but I want), PC gaming, jetskiing, flying (private pilot), and drinking unhealthy amounts of alcohol every weekend (I'm a college student, what did you expect?)

Name: Zackory Cui
Age: 17
Location: Belmont California.
Current setup: 170kv 6374 20/60 3m 10s1p 30Q 90mm 
Occupation: none, I wish I found one I liked :frowning_face:

I love anything that delivers pure happiness and keeps me away from reality. I messed with computer software and hardware for the half of my life and wish to make a living doing just that; mostly coding and surfing reddit for dank memes. Being the lazy nature as I am, I pertain from participating in sports and workouts. Hanging out with my skating goons steered me towards the opulent hobby of esk8s. Making friends and talking to people isn't something I am really good at, seeing some of your guys' bio is making me jealous. :sweat_smile: Wish me luck on my next girlfriend. :kissing_smiling_eyes:

Being an introvert, this forum has become my first resort for social interaction. I wanna thank everyone for your time helping me and others and keeping this such a great place. :hugs::slightly_smiling_face:

IG: zackorycramer :point_left:t2: I follow back :wink:

Name: Brian
Age: 39
Location: downtown Saint Louis, Missouri, USA
Occupation: Software Engineer

I use electric skateboards as tools mainly (versus toys)

Though frequently I seriously enjoy just riding to ride.  I sold my car and my truck and use exclusively small electric vehicles, most of the time that means skateboard because you don't have to park them outside.  Walk into a business with an ebike and they instantly tell you to take it outside, and leave it there so someone can steal it.  Walk in with a skateboard and they ignore it.

Name: Kelly  (is dude)
Age: 32
Location: Eugene Oregon, Usa
Occupation: Cook by day, also Own and operate a small business. Cleaning restaurants and bars after they close down (why I'm up till 6am most days) 

Hobbies: anything on a board. I learn to surf before I rode a bike and I grew up in Venice Beach with a halfpipe in my backyard. I used to build old 60s and 70s imports (mostly datsun/toyota) complete death traps lol.
But my wife and I had our first baby.  So we downsized our living situation. (I lost my shop) and I stopped trying to be a drift king.
So now I'm dipping my feet into esk8. this town is flat, has very few hills to bomb, The beach here sucks for surfing and the snow is meh.... esk8 is the answer to the void in my life.
