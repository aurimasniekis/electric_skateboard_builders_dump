If you could give me your desired wheelbase, your concave, and form I could reccomend a few for you.

If you'd consider something more special:

Very nice, stiff natural boards. I'm using the "Slider" model on my build, very satisfied.

https://www.banjoboards.co.uk/decks/ are good, made to order, and customisable. I have the Jannu which is pretty stiff.

hey ! thanks for the heads up @Michaelinvegas

I reshaped the jet spud to fit my riding style and make it more custom for esk8:
- flat area below the deck with a nice concave,
- includes glass fiber to give it a good strength,
- and a nice carbon top sheet on my special releases,
- hand made by a shaper in France, no mass production.
