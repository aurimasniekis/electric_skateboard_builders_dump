So...I've got this arbor Vaugenhausen (sp?) that has been the deck for 2 boards, I wanted to rebuild it so I started sanding and stripping, then fill in the holes with wood filler, sand, clear coat, CF on the bottom, regrip the top, blah blah blah.  I got the sanding and stripping done and said frig it, I'm tired.  

Later that night, in bed with the wife and she says "why do you smell like vanilla?". My response, though not carefully considered was accurate.  I said "I don't know, the stripper smelled like orange."

Approx .05 seconds later I felt a girly punch in the kidney and I was "WTF woman".  Then I realized I didn't say paint stripper.  

So after explaining and realizing my wife is a nut case about some things we had a good laugh, but I don't think I'm gonna sleep well for awhile ðŸ˜€.

Lol. Nicely done. I would have said that to my wife on purpose just for her reaction... And promptly would have gotten a vicious poking or nipple pinching. Worth it.

My wife would have simply exclaimed "Cookie!" with a gravelly mock-angry voice because we call each other Cookie and I joke like that a lot so she pretends to be angry about it. 

her: "Why were you late?" 

me: "hookers and blow, you know how it goes."

her: "COOKIE!"

me "hehehehe"

lol, I dig that.  I often reply "My girlfriend wouldn't do that" when the wife says I cant have cake or spend 20 grand on a boat...but I said the stripper thing with no humor so I guess she thought I was serious, but all is good ).
