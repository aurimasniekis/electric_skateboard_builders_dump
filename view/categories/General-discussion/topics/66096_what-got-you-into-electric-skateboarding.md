For me it was three kids riding around the neighborhoods near my house. One had a meepo, one had a boosted, and another had one of the other hub motor boards. I was riding my OG DH board set up for mild carving... Sweating my butt off pushing a mile and a half from my residence. I thought to myself... as an adult, these kids are flying around effortlessly and here I am holding onto pushing. I knew I needed motors, and I knew I needed to be able to tune things to my liking. Google let me to the VESC and researching the VESC led me here and to the Electric Skateboarding discord channel.

That's how I got here, I'm curious... How did you all end up here?

I watched an episode of all American makers and saw a cheap Arduino powered board and said “I can do that better”

Ugh.. ashamed, shall i really tell you? :sweat_smile:
All the way Casey Neistat. I did street skateboarding, but did not pursue it for years. Watching Casey riding the boosted stroke me. A bit of research led me to Enertion and then on to here. In the beginning i read the reddit content too but got bored of the bad vibe over there. 
Fast forward, now i am a fuck.ng addict, man I really did not anticipated how much fun and how awesome this community is!!

really clichè this is, but got into casey neistat, saw him riding boosteds, and then saw a video titled like "make your own electric skateboard" and i was like hell yes it can't be too expensive. So i impulse bought a long board, and researched the prices and was like hell nah. So the board sat in my closet for about 2 or 3 years. Then, i had a major work i needed to make for electronics at school. So i saw this as a prime opportunity to build an esk8. (my parents also contributed to the cost which was awesome). Now, i have this, and way too much read time on this forum :joy:

It started with watching the Casey Neistat videos on YouTube. I showed my 14 year old the videos because he was into skateboarding and interested in mechanical engineering. Then we stumbled across this forum when researching how to build one. My son did all the research, put together the budget numbers, secured funding from the CFO (aka mom), and I helped him build it. When he left for summer camp I decided to ride it. I hadn’t been on a board in 25+ years, but it came back to me fairly quickly. I put 20-30 miles on it the week he was gone and knew I had to build one for myself. Now it’s just over a year later and we have 4 DIY builds in the family (3 longboards and a Trampa mountainboard).

I typically ride a push board or a bicycle to and from work during the summer and I started working a lot of overtime and my wife surprise me with a Riptide R1. My knee started giving out a few years ago and I couldn't really do street/park sk8ing anymore.  And the town we moved to a few years ago lack's Hills worth riding. 
So I instantly fell in love with a new form of being on a board. But after about a week of killing my battery way too quickly, not going as fast as I wanted to and hating the power sag I found this place.

I had watched Casey Neistat riding the Boosted board and thought "that looks cool! I want to get one of those!". I went to the internet, searched "boosted board" and my dreams got crushes. "$1300 AND YOU CAN ONLY GO 7 MILES DAFUQ!". 
I started looking for electric skateboards on kickstarter and indiegogo cause they were cheaper. I found the Huger Tech campaign and saw their small classic board and bought it for $450. A week later I realized I needed more range so I got my classic board refunded and bought the bigger travel board for $650 with 22 mile range. Weeks go by and the delivery date gets moved further and further away from the original. 3 months after I bought the board and hadn't received it I was sure I had got scammed. I had asked for a refund but never got it. But then I though "I wanna build my own electric skateboard".
I started reading and it became an addiction. 3 months later and a lot of reading I got a package. Guess what. It was the board I bought 6 months ago! I opened the box and took the board for a ride. I loved that feeling of not having to push and go 20mph but the board was shitty, stiff and hard to turn. IT WAS AT THIS MOMENT I KNEW I HAD TO BUILD AN ELECTRIC SKATEBOARD. So that's what I did.
I started ordering parts, reading and reading. I knew I had to sell my Huger Tech board cause I wouldn't need it when I had my new board finished. So I put it up on a local site and meet 3 different people luckily the 3rd person bought it (which saved my ass. I had no money to pay import taxes).
Fast forward the time to now, I have all parts, tools and skill to build an electric skateboard just need to put it together.

Casey over here as well. But then he started to smash everything he has, not caring about any equipment or boards. So then I stopped watching him. 10 broken cameras? C'mon...
Anywho, discovered that boosted are 1500$ and gave up on the idea. 4 month later discovered that people were building DIY so 6 month after that, made my own

I got into it after volunteering with these guys:
https://www.google.co.il/amp/s/www.timesofisrael.com/near-blind-boy-gets-dream-skateboard-in-tikkun-olam-challenge/amp/
A motorized skateboard was one of the early options (deemed too dangerous in this case). We didn't go with that in the end but the idea stuck with me and I thought "surely someone has to have tried this by now, right?"
I started googling around and found this site pretty quickly, haven't looked back!

I have been an electric rider for over 10 years (not sure how many)
First ebikes, then scooters and then esk8.
Actually my first attempt for an esk8 was 10 years ago but it was really difficult and undeveloped those days... Nowadays it's plenty of pieces for sale at many stores. Li ion 
 got cheaper and better, we got vescs and there's no need to weld the motor mounts anymore.

Saw a Kickstarter advert for the M1 three years ago and thought "one day I'll have that". Even thought at the time  10km range sounded impressive. Put the idea to bed for two years thinking I'd wait for the tech to mature, but around Xmas this year I found this forum. Too much to take in all in one go, so lurked around for a bit. Finally took the plunge in Feb, buying a kit from Street Wing. With their guidance and support I ended up with a rather special eboard, and now I'm planning at least two more projects - one cheap, one expensive. Love building things, and love skating again now I'm too old for vert !

Skateboarding all my life.  I have taken a few 5 year breaks always seem to come back when new stuff comes out .  I have always dreamed of e-boards being possible, now they are finally here.  Leaned how to make my own DYI board but it can be frustrating so I just buy them complete. I used to be on a site called NCDSA Northern California Down Hill Skateboard association. I have been riding since 1975.  Got into longboards in 1996 yet I had a long Makaha in the 70s.  I maybe one of the first people to introduce bamboo to boards maybe even carbon fiber I made them  in the early 1990s and posted it on this site and mentioned combinations as well.  I did this because maple was said to have the most pop and I knew other materials could be better.   My name was the Kanoa Kid

I used to skateboard as a kid, I didn’t realize then but I really needed a longboard, I never cared for tricks. Carving and cruising was what I loved.

Flash forward a decade or two, I was with my daughter in toys r us and saw a razor e board. It only went like 9 miles an hour and was pricey for what it could do. So I forgot about it. For about one week. Then I became obsessed with building a really good board, which led me here.

I got a DUI 3 years ago and started using the bus system with my longboard to get around Seattle. A year and a half later my feet were getting tired of pushing and i hated my local bus route. I bought an evolve bamboo gt and loved it! It only took me a month or 2 to find the diy scene and I knew the bamboo wasnt gonna cut it for that long. Fast forward to today and ive got 3 boards running (all diy), and 2 scooters for my wife. Totally addicted

**MID LIFE CRISIS**

:rofl:

I saw some kids with ginormous  balls going downhill on their longboards and decided to get into longboarding.

Got myself a cheap no-name longboard to learn on and found out I'm too old to push and while my responsibilities grew as a family man my balls consequently shrunken down a bit (still enough for esk8ing though :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:)

Decided to get an electric scooter to commute but then I discovered electric longboards.

So I decided to go DIY since I love tinkering around. What can i say. i wish i discovered this muuuch much sooner.

Was in high school, thinking about college and getting around campus. Kept on thinking about the best way, and skateboarding seemed the way to go (had been boarding for about 10 years as of that year). I'm in Florida, and really didn't want to get into classes all sweaty (was starting in summer semester), so I thought about adding a motor to my board, then started to learn what that entailed. Through googling found this site and haven't left since.

When younger I skated everywhere it was my main mode of transportation all the way through colledge.  Fast forward 25 years and got a dog with a lot of energy that needed exercise and I thought again of skateboarding.  My dog and I have been Esk8ing for the last 5 years.  She loves it as much as me.  It is freedom for her and I from the busy hectic world around us.  She comes to me a will houl when she wants to go out. So much fun for both of us.

I was watching downhill longboarding videos when I was learning how to skate and thought it was cool but no way could I ever do that. Eventually I saw Casey Neistat videos and other "eboad vloggers" and got hooked when I bought my first board. After a year of riding I built my own. Pushing was a big obstacle for me when I was learning traditional because of my prosthetic leg. Now that's not much of a problem and although I practice occasionally and find freedom on purely focusing on my balance.

I had just got promoted to a full time job that payed for my tuition so I had a bit of money to use on whatever , I’ve been thinking about commuting to public transportation somehow so I was looking at electric bikes and somehow found electric skateboards. I then found the subreddit and lurked a bit , bought a Meepo to try it out and couldn’t ride for shit (I had bought a push board weeks before to practice).

After figuring out that I was riding the Meepo the wrong way (didn’t fix it though , felt really good) I like being able to wake up later and take me to the train station faster. 

After riding around in the rain and foolishly having the charge port open , my Meepo broke and has been siting in my closet for months now. Got another board that also had issues and decided Fuck it, I’ll go over and slothfully bud a board and keep up with what’s up and coming.

I have a Boosted Board now to get me to work anda t as a back up board , now I’m just waiting on stuff to get to me to finally have 3 fully working boards

Honestly, this just seemed like a no brainer after I touched a Boosted Board.  May my boosted RIP. Not that it is broken, but everytime I get on it now after being on badass custom boards, it just feels so goddamn anemic.

And, building this shit is just a damn blast.  This hobby is way cheaper than when I was all about my Harley.....

It is amazing I can get even more thrills at a fraction of the cost and danger.  Also, I am a bit of a drinker, and it is a lot harder (not impossible) to get into trouble on an electric skateboard than a $30,000 Harley when you look like you belong in an MC...... LOL

My daughter got me into it.  She was thirteen and was banging on about this electric skateboard so we got it for her one christmas.  It was a great big FIIK with lead acid batteries that weighed a ton but she loved it.  Eventually it broke and I spent a weekend butchering some lipos, chucked in my castle mamba max esc and hey presto off it went again.  Couldn't stop there though and got a cheapo brushless 280kv motor from ebay and grafted on some more lipos and off it went again only faster this time until it blew the mamba sky high.  There it stayed for a year or so until I came across a video of a funny guy with long hair who was building fire breathing monsters that did crazy speeds then came a youtube binge, a landwheel a meepo and now 5 builds that have seen me fry burn pop poof snap and break just about every thing.  Much depleted bank account and the biggest smiles possible from someone who has been into adventure sports his whole life.

For me it was a 2.6 mile walk/run I had to endure everday after school. My mom got a jobs so I had no ride. I also had to carry my viola which was a pain. It wasn't until after a year of walking that after a long day I decided to make my life a little easier. 

Around this time the boosted board came out too which I saw on YouTube. So I did some research. Ordered two 3s 20c lipos and a vesc (took 3 months to get to me tho). 

Kinda funny though cause before I finished the board the extension for the train had already been finished. Sooooooo I had the board for litterally no reason.... Naturally I ended up getting addicted and I absolutely love the board I have now!

I LOVE living in the center of town in a high-rise but the car was the most pain-in-the-ass thing I owned because there's never anywhere to park and I hate all the pollution it makes ... then one day while browsing the web a random Inboard M1 advertisement came up ... I glanced at it and went on my way ... then I was like WAIT...DID THAT SKATEBOARD HAVE MOTORS IN THE WHEELS? So I started searching for more info (the ad was long since gone by the time my brain caught-up)

Not a skater, never used a skateboard, about 40 years old, ended up buying a used Evolve CarbonGT to try out, and a few weeks later the car was up for sale and a Metroboard was on the way... and then of course DIY happened

About 5-6 years ago I was googling electric scooters for my sons and came across a video about FIIK skateboard, which lead me to a video about about boosted boards...I think this was before Casey because I knew about boosted boards before I knew about that weird haired dude. 

Anyway I had just moved down to SoCal and bought a push board for cruising along the strand and loved the idea of a board that I could legitimately use as transportation without sweating my ass off. The boosted range didn’t appeal to me, so I finally bought a Raptor 1 about 3 years ago, after fixing that a couple times, I went  DIY. Now I’m completely hooked and I have boards for my whole family...and my wife calls me an esk8 nerd.

Was looking up unique Raspberry Pi projects - came across an electric skateboard project that used a Raspberry Pi that connects to the ESC. Bought all my parts and started that same project, but blew the ESC. Instead of wasting money on a 2nd ESC, I invested the money into a VESC to finish the build. Raspberry Pi is now being used as my media server.

I actually had a bike that I used as a last miler. Then realized Berkeley has a lot of hills, and I would end up at my destination sweaty and fucking disgusting, BLEGH! Then my bike got stolen (not surprised), and I was actually looking at making the lightest bike possible to maybe combat the hills. Then I thought, wait a minute, we're in the future now. What about an electric bike? Then realized a lot of them were like 50+ pounds. Have fun carrying that thing up flights of stairs, and then it'll get stolen eventually, cause NorCal. 

So I looked up alternative PEV's, from scooters (LAME) then eventually to skateboards. Never skated in my life, but it was calling out to me. Now I'm thinking of getting into downhill longboarding. 

Funny, I'll be hitting the canyons from a car, to a motorcycle, now to a freaking plank of wood. Thrills keep getting cheaper and cheaper.

I saw my first e board at a Sport Chalet in college. it was huge and had some ridiculous price tag, didn't think much of them until I saw the first prototype Boosted in a magazine, still high price tag...eventually I preordered the Copenhagen bike wheel for $1,200, wait 3 years and still nothing came out. 

The money was already spent in my mind, so when I got the refund it went straight into ordering a Boosted V2. The wait was taking a long time so I was just googling reviews and whatnot and ended up here. Built my first single 6374 board way before the Boosted arrived.

I used to skate in middle school and high school I eventually stopped but almost in my 30s I saw the Zboard and I fell in love with skating all over again I got a couple of regular long boards my girl got a Globe drop down and I got a Landyachts pin tail and we both rode them push boards like crazy almost daily for about a year. I finally put down for my first esk8 the Raptor 2.... Little did I know LMAO. After 4 months I got impatient and pre-ordered a Blink S2 in the hopes I'd get it before the Raptor 2 to practice with a less powerful board.. well 2 days after I pre-ordered I found a Used Raptor 1 dual on eBay for 900 shipped. I cancelled the S2 and got the Raptor 1 since then I build 3 boards before Enertion could ship me the Raptor 2. Now I am a power junkie I like to ride fast and hard lol

I have been commuting about 6 miles to work by way of bus, train and my Segway Mini for a number of years now and wanted to find a faster, more fun and lighter form of transportation. I have watched many reviews on pre-built boards and have never been super impressed by them so I have decided to venture into building my own DIY board. I have been reading just about every post I can find on what parts work and don't work and have started ordering parts for my build. I hope to have it all together by around Christmas. Having 2 teenagers with expensive sports my money isn't always easy to funnel into a new toy/project.

Have you ridden the Segway Mini for that mush distance?!? I like using it to roll slow and quietly around the neighborhood. Can't imagine  using it for a commute though....have you seen their GoKart kit for it? I really want to get it but don't know where I would use it.

I was looking for personal transportation to get down to the gym near my house, found electric unicycles and was primed to get one when I realized I would look like an utter dipshit floating around on one.

Started poking around for ebikes but wanted something smaller, found esk8 and got hooked. Proceeded to build a board heavier than an ebike that I cant lock up :smiley: - All in the name of convenience

Well my story is pretty much simple I was living in Germany, and was planning to move to UK which involved selling European car, I knew about electric skateboards for a really long time, so I just had idea to buy evolve carbon gt 2 in 1 and did that and moved to UK and rode for half year like 2k km and when wanted to switch to something better that's how I entered to DIY esk8 stuff :slight_smile:

Oh and we were making cases for vesc since 2014-2015 I think

Let's see...use to love driving but after living in San Francisco for 4 years for school, cultivated my hate for driving and loving the convenience of not having a car and everything that came with it. 

Worked down in Pasadena for a little while and biked to work for most of it...which was a little stressful because of always having to find a place to lock up the bike, then trying to carry it around when something would go wrong on it or if I have to go up stairs...

Then I moved back up to NorCal when the contract work ended and I was looking at electric bikes and single speed bikes for transportation, but was concerned with the heft of electric bikes and the high probability of the bike being stolen (freaking NorCal). So I decided I needed something electric but carry-able so I didn't have to find a place to lock it.

Started researching different methods of electric transportation and thought of electric skateboards, because if a bike can be electrified, why not a skateboard. Came across Mellow...and was tempted to get it but my gut was telling me NAH and came across DIY on reddit and it lead me here.
Sucky part is...an electric skateboard can still be stolen here in NorCal...usually by mugging...:unamused:

PS...I use to skateboard in elementary school but sucked at doing anything street, then started again when I lived in San Francisco...fun times :smile:.

My toy build is a dual 6374 12s carbon lowrider that I play on.  My daily driver is a 10s hub motor Flexi deck that weighs nothing and never lets me down.  Much lol.  
Got a dual hub Santa Cruz cruiser for those old school days.  Even has a kick pad on it 😁.  Tried it on the local skatepark but won’t be doing that again.   Painful experience when you realise you’re not 20 anymore.

The thing I think separating the two ... you can clearly see a difference ...

Some people want to go 278mph and wear full titanium pads from head to toe and use 12S or 13S on 60V max circuitry.  Clearly, these folks have/build "toys".

Others have only a helmet (or multiple helmets) and often skate with shorts and a T-shirt and don't like to exceed 20-30mph, ever.  This is a hallmark of an esk8 being a "tool" and these are often the better boards designed for maximum reliability.  Because if you're running to the store to grab milk or to grab a burger on your lunch break, or going grocery shopping and carrying 40lbs home, suiting up for a full 50mph ride is a ridiculous notion and nobody has time for all that.  I'd just rather go slower and not fall off or break my board because I have to be back at work in 30 minutes anyway and I'm really busy and don't have time for a breakdown.

That’s why I call it my toy.  I think that the fact that people are pushing the boundaries of performance does in fact help the more conservative among us.   Most usable innovations do in fact come from some crazy bastard in a workshop somewhere trying to make the impossible possible.  I will agree though that it is just as much fun to chuck your helmet on and go for a leisurely cruise as it is to blast off into the sunset with your wheels on fire.  Truth be told the toy very rarely gets above 35 these days but it does it uphill and that’s the kicker for me.  There’s only so much fun to be had in a straight line.

Yeah @goldrabe I intentionally "forget" to get milk or coffee beans or other small things all the time.

I just want an excuse to ride to the store and go get it.  And I'll leave right when the store closes, so I have to go across town to the 24-hour one.

Riding esk8 for daily transportaion NEVER, EVER gets old and is a blast EVERY SINGLE TIME

@b264 and I may see esk8 a bit different. But I think the core is the same. While I can't commute to work, in can around town by my house. I don't have the time restriction to pad up. But taking every chance I get to skate to the store etc is basically the same.

I think the difference between us is I live oudside the main populous of the city, so can't commute. But live in an established area so things like restaurant, stores etc are all within skating/biking distance from home to live that lifestyle outside of work. 

I certainly see my 13s as a reliable commuter. It just doesn't align with the distance to work. I have the potato for commuting around campus/food for lunch. And all I wear is a half cap and gloves. But typically don't exceed ~18mph, I could do the same on the Evo. 

I think my point is, skating to skate is just something you do for the love of the ride.... Just 100% commitment might not be feasible for everyone. But the love of the ride isn't any different.

never heard of Casey Neistat until this thread -- time to spend more time on youtube...
I broke my arm really well bicycling home -- I can't bike, ride my scooter or drive my car (it's a manual) for several months...
I had a couple of hoverboard motors sitting around from another project and was going to build one. Turns out the parts cost to finish was a little higher than I wanted so I hopped over to craigslist -- and there was a lead-acid, 800 watt brushed motor beast. I've put almost 50 mile on the dang thing and I'm loving it -- I'm slowly getting parts together for another one for the wife.

I never got to skate as a kid and hated that I never learned. I'd acquired a ton of random scrap scooter parts through Craigslist and dumpster diving. I found [this instructable](https://www.instructables.com/id/DIY-Electric-Skateboard/) and it was game over. I built my first board: brushed motor, non programmable speed controller, metal scooter platform with a hand cut plywood deck that was way too thick, wired throttle, and heavy ass SLA batteries. ![20180607_140803|666x500](upload://by9XNyK761IFOJMQLlkPLWo70Sd.jpeg)

Rode well on flat ground but slowed up on hills too much. Started my research and got into lithium batteries. The board could fly up hills but the motor was on its way to melting. I'm now getting ready to finish up my first real board. Just have to wait to actually get the parts for Christmas and then order the battery. The constant upgrading and fine tuning culminating in satisfaction of a job well done really gets me.
