After seeing some videos and reading about the Evolve remote I was wondering why I havn't seen more posts about having real time data at your fingertips while riding.

I know some will argue with "ugh, one more thing that will take the riders attention", but having speed, battery status, etc would be very usefull. Don't get me wrong, there are alot of awesome remote controllers and mods for them but I have yet to see a remote like Evolve's. 

Are there any more advanced remote controllers on the market or posts about them?
