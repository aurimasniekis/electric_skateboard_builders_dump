Reported for being off topic. 
Let's talk more about getting home when esk8 fails. 
If it's a enertion failure the ambulance is normally the first choice

Yeah there's not enough talk about psychological well-being in the world of esk8!  I was just so sad when I had to push, and also when I realized how out of shape I am after pushing 2 mi - it was just such a joy to have positive community at  when I got home!

You had it lucky. I was on campus riding to my car and I hit a crack/bump going about 15-20mph... The board snapped in half and I had to carry both ends to my car about 1.5 miles away. ![20190919_132057|374x500](upload://w5ggAZxOgH9iJlI5TsewIQwS6VB.jpeg) ![20190919_132045|690x377](upload://zCKdXX72hYoWr5ZJe3r8X3LigEM.jpeg)

Thankfully I didn't fall. My plastic battery enclosure took a the hit and I just skid to a stop. Also, motor had no damage after my rear trucks flung off

Thank you OP. I checked out the other forum and my mood is much better now. Saved me a trip to the therapist. 10/10. would recommend.

No idea, I still have no idea how I managed to stay on it. I'm really thankful that the back broke and not the front. Had the front broken it would've launched me
