I got this idea from another thread where a couple of guys were talking cars. There is a ton of talent on this forum in terms of craftsmanship and creativity. So I've always been curious if some of y'alls vehicles reflected that. Here are a few of mine from the past. Feel free to post cars, trucks, motorcycles, go karts etc!

Beautiful bike, WP! 

Do you ride it on the streets as well or just racetracks? 

btw, the other day I spotted the perfect summer ride for you :innocent:

Nice one @shred,  bet you had a good time in this cozy old banger.  

Reminds me of this one I had for some years.  Drove it all around the old continent.  
Gee,  think it's a clear sign of getting old when you can list an infinite number of past rides...  Almost getting sentimental ...  :sob: :sob:

A Troopy stuck on the beach!
Fraser Island? Any sharks in the beach break? 

Got stuck once riding a beach buggy off some dunes in Brazil. In the dead of the night. Took us several hours and a decent amount of dried donkey shit to get us out and going again. Dried donkey shit and our flip-flops were the only solid things around that we could use to provide traction for the wheels.

You litterally have my dream car! I love the old sl r107's, and am surely going to restore one someday..

For now though, I'm a 16 year old trying to buy a triumph tr6 on a 6k budget.. The hardest thing is finding one relatively close.. (it'll be a project car of course).

2012 wrangler Rubicon (moab desert edition), 3.5 inch lift on 35's as well. 

She just hit 75k miles, and is going strong, but with my brothers kayak, our paddle boards, etc, a pickup will soon take its place.. Unfortunately as I really enjoy this jeep.

I will soon either buy a willys cj3a (Im good friends with a guy who flips them), or more likely I'll try and find a triumph tr6 project car. 6k doesn't get you very far though, and it's hard to find older triumphs locally.

unfortunately it doesn't- the Moab just has different front and rear bumpers. 

The lights, rock guards, etc were all put on by us afterwards. 

The lift was put on by a local company called happy trails that specializes in Jeep modifications.

Got any more pics of the ute? Looks interesting. And is that a Skyline too? You Aussies roll some clean ass rides. 

@lowguido I'm digging your street rockets too. But isn't most of Oz (that is what you call it, right?) unpaved no man's land? Where are your all terrain outback monsters?

You know, like the Aussie equivalent of this Russian beast.

Nice one! I have a '73 in storage. Needs an engine and tranny rebuild, but otherwise in nice condition. Been waiting until my kids get old enough to sit in the front seat before I get it back up and running. No point until then. Picked it up for a song when I was a kid and rebuilt it. Only has 150hp, but it's a heck of a lot of fun to drive!

Hi Chris. Its a Renault Megane RS265 2lt Twin scroll turbo FWD 265hp, limited slip diff perfo hub front suspension to get the tractiion down. Google it for nurgburg ring. Did it in 8.08. Fastest FWD on that track at the time. Beating many cars more exotic and expensive. If you ever get a chance to drive one do it. Great drivers car.

at the end of last year I bought a new audi rs3 to end the era of combustions engines with a bang. 5zylinder ralley sound with 400hp, been fiddling mostly with the car the last few months, lots of small adjustments, new race suspension, light performance wheels, oil heating, removing seats, cage coming soon and in june its a first time for me with a car on a race track (been riding motorcycles on race tracks for 7years now)!

@whitepony
That's a nice one! I guess hatchback is only available in Europe.    Automatic?

I picked Focus RS up last year in March as well I have been taking this bad boy to the track since then. It was pretty solid as it was but I felt there is something missing so I replaced with a bigger intercooler and tuned with Cobb, now it makes 410 horsepower and 420 lb-ft of torque at the wheel.

@MasterCho 

wow, love the focus rs, especially in that blue :heart_eyes:

how does it perform on the track? i was really unhappy with the rs stock suspension, was wobbly and unprecise, car was rolling like crazy. its now a more track oriebted suspension and lowered by another 3cm - the effect was massive, superhappy now!

@whitepony 

I was very impressed with the Audi fully digital instrument display and minimalistic interior when I saw the car in person while ago. :+1:

When I drove focus RS for the first lap, it wasn't disappointing out of the box and the confidence built up quickly to go faster for the second lap, I  didn't have to "fight /attack" for corners, it went right along. 

  I must say it's quite different from Lotus that I have driven last 10 years on the track, it's like "analog vs digital".  It drives like "a well built analog race car" in a heavy hatchback but easier, a little bit of understeer but quickly I could adapt it to prevent it next corner.

 I guess in the 10 years of gab, the technology has been quite evolved.

Obviously, there is some room to improve such as camber adjustments, better springs (Eibach springs), and stiffening the chassis etc. the best mod I did to the car was replacing the racing tires. I must say It's a good track day daily driver.

All the "performance cars " are supposed to be driven hard and built strong right?  people love to modify it with a bigger turbo with more boosts they call it " Tuning".  Ford brought Focus RS to the USA for the first time for the fans who want more power but still, it's happening as they beat the shit out of it on the track including my myself.:grin:

I got one recall from ford for replacing a head gasket, it has been blown among some people in Europe. In the power of the internet, Ford decided to replace it with a better-designed gasket for the engine.

It's not only happening to Ford but also, Subaru STI, Evo, BMW, Audi you name it.

my 1987 base model Toyota Pickup. 

at the moment it needs a whole new engine. Jake is working on the interior and i'm working on saving up for the engine because its seized. All the peripherals are good, though. New AC, new cooling, new alternator, tranny is solid. And the ASA AR1s look great on it. That's original paint, too. 

it delivered a whole ass load of space cells once upon a time...

ITs always Taco Time! I love my yotas. We also have a 2015 Camry my wife drives and I'm currently riding in an 09 RAV4. Neither of which are really picture worthy. But my baby truck man... can't wait to get her running again. Around 140hp at 2500 pounds it has a decent power to weight ratio and drives like a fucking go-cart on those low profile Sumitomos. When i dropped the 50 pound rear bumper it really let the rear end loose and now it loves to just swing the whole ass end around when you dump the clutch. 

Jake took one of the leaf springs out to drop it an inch in the back, so now its levelled.

My daughter's the same way it's scary. That's a mic cord tied to a little thing with caster wheels on it hahaha. Plus that was two years ago she's way crazier now, kid learned to ride without training wheels this year and first thing she did was learn to hop off curbs *cue tiny heart attacks*

In 2004 I bought a Tacoma standard cab manual trans. brand new for 18k. I owned it for 13 years. I sold it last year with 97k miles for $10,700. Do the math on that! Tacoma's are the best vehicle on the planet. I took that $ and purchased a 2017 double cab V6 4x4.

new to me is 2017!   it just seems like steel bikes have gone to the side.  you can get one but the materials used havent been improved upon anymore.   i havent seen a new tubing set out of columbus, and truetemper shut down, reynolds has a couple nice tubing sets but i never see them on a bike and if they are i bet they would cost waaay too much.   and what is for sale at even a half decent price has no fancy tubes.  i had a landshark once with the thinnest tubes.  it was rubber but much nicer than my super thin aluminum frame with starship columbus tubing.  that was a noodle with no rebound vs the steel

Steel is nice but no match for carbon fibre. 
If you want performance you choose carbon fibre, there is no other way around it.
However if you want a nice steel frame for whatever reason there are still many being made.

I’ve had many carbon.  Just sold my planetx pro carbon. Had a Ridley carbon, and a trek carbon, and two cheap carbon frames form china, which were as nice if not nicer than all the others.   carbon is nice for sure but its all good and the new ibike coming s aluminum which i've also had a million aluminum frames.  in my life im sure ive had at least 40 bikes.  i used to average 400 miles a week at one point.  the bay area is bike racing or just riding mecca


Those steel frames cost more than my entire bike w sram force

That's a pretty car but the Webber carburators though, I wonder if it's the same that were used on AMC 304s in Jeep CJs. They were put on earth just to frustrate me and make me drink more Jameson 😀.

Not sure about the AMC 304s
Triple Stromberg's were standard on the XU1
These were 45 DCOE Weber's and an absolute bitch to tune.

Way beyond my skill level. It took me years to find someone who could tune them properly.
I use to start her at 3 am to go to work...all the windows in the house would rattle and shake...lol

When you stuck your boot into her the sound was money...:grin:


I got this picture in my head a bearded bloke half way in some engine bay, garden hose up to his ear screwdriver in the other hand cursing about something, bottle of Jameson nearby..:joy:

I usually just replace the intake with an edlbrock air gap and a 650 cfm avenger, they are pretty much tuned out if the box. 

I hear you on the sound, it's epic 😀.

1970 Honda N600, did a complete engine rebuild and used it as a daily driver for over a year. Unfortunately had to sell it to make way for other opportunities but it was a fun little car.

Thanks! And yeah it's small but it's a 6.5' bulbfin keel with a 9500lbs ballast. She's quite fast and stable for her size. On a good day (20-30knot wind) we can average 9-10knots and reach up to 13-14knots top speed. Haven't been out past 40knot wind with her yet. And anything under 10knots we crawl.

Here is my pricipal set of wheels, although I'm starting to plan my first build now. Had it for a year and a half; makes me grin when driven. 2015 Mini Cooper base, black with dual red stripes, and my favorite, the rally lights! There just isn't too much room for the boards inside...

You probably already guessed it by my name, but I've got a crappy 2001 Saturn L100 with the added spoiler package. Manual windows, cassette player, broken air-con, the works. I love this thing because I don't need to care about it and it mostly works.
