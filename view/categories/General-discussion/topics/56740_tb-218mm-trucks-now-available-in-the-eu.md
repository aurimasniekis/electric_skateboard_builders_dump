I have just had a big ass delivery of TB 218 trucks and will be stocking them from now on @ Street Wing

![218s|690x445](upload://fp4hOMxRWF7brvfoej4wQTgIv5p.jpg)

I have managed to do a deal and buy in bulk so have slashed the previous price I needed to charge - and **to further sweeten the deal here is an extra Â£5 off coupon for forum members: esk8builders-218**

Damn those are more than double the price on tourqueboards website. Even with shipping and taxes they are around the same price as if I would buy them from the US. :( I love to see them in europe for less shipping time though!
