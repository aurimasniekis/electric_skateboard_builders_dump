Has anyone ever partially shredded a motor wire by having it brush the motor?  I shredded one about 50%. Would it be possible to solder over this, shrink wrap, then operate like that?

You already asked this in your main thread, just wait for a response. You can solder another cable, but you'll lose the cable's flex

Just resolder it together and heat shrink it. As @SirDiff said you'll lose the flex but it'll work fine
