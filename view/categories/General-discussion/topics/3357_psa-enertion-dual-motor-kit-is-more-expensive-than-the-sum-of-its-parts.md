Unless I'm missing something, purchasing all the individual parts of the Enertion dual drive mech kit is cheaper than the drive mech kit itself even with its current sale of $331 USD. The parts themselves are not on sale and total $290.66 USD. The only thing missing are the bearing spacers which I could not find on the site.

probably not intentional. You should contact them and let them know.

doesn't the kit come assembled ? in this case the extra should be for the work done. I recognized this also before making a purchase. thought well about it and i came to the conclusion that the extra 20$ would come for the work done. I know it is an easy task but it does take time...from my point of view it is a correct price if it comes assembled. correct me if i am wrong :smile:

I looked into all the kits out there, enertions is a bit more expensive than buying the parts themselves but then again he is running a business and paying employees to do this work, diyelectricskateboards their kit is a bit cheaper than sum of parts
