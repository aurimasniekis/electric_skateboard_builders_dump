I'm currently going through all of my spare parts.  I've found quite a few that I won't be using again. These will be free for the taking, just pay shipping. Small items usually cost $3, larger items like wheels are usually about $7, really big stuff is $13.

I will add things as I run across them  I'll start with the wheels.

83mm black flywheel clones, almost new - @intensivegecko 
90mm black flywheel clones with ABS 36t pulleys & generic abec 7 bearings, 500 miles - @anorak234 
97mm red flywheel clones with generic abec 7 bearings, almost new - @Pr0dy 

Edit:  I also have some white 90mm flywheel clones, approx 100 miles. They are at my office so I don't have pics yet but the look like hammered hell as white thane does not stand up to dirty roads.

Better than throwing them away.  I do a lot of experimenting so I end up with extra parts.

Also, these motor mounts. They were fabricated and sold by someone on the forum, can't remember who, but I couldn't get the clamps to work...shredded a hanger trying, so use at your own risk. 

I don't know where the idler bearings went, but it's just a 8mm bolt with 2 abec bearings and some speed rings. They should be easy to come up with. 

If you want them send me a PM.

These are Hobby King motor mounts, from the 1st batch. I've never used them. They will take some modifications to work on caliber 2 trucks, or any trucks really. 

I'd prefer to give then to separate people, want to get as many people riding as possible. Shipping in the US will be $7 and $32 to Europe.

I need a belt and wheel pulley for my penny nickel.

That'd been out of commission for a while now but I was gifted the new board so I haven't really been fixing the penny. I got them on ebay for the 72mm wheel but I wound up getting 76mm wheels and altering the wheel to make the Pulley fit. But as you can see, the Pulley was ruined and the belt was stripped. I'm not sure what size I need but I'd grab one of these belts listed here to see if I could get it to work. Also a Pulley if it might be able to fit.

Its 5mm pitch?

I counted
75 teeth x 5mm = 375mm

No way that's 375mm, most belts are under 300 mm unless you're using an idler pulley.

@Sapphirinia If you turn the belt sideways, there's usually words printed on the side without the teeth. It should say length and pitch there. Also check out this kit if you need new pulleys and everything https://www.ebay.com/itm/DIY-Electric-Skateboard-ABEC-Flywheel-Pulley-Kit-15mm-Wide-Belts/401346364035?hash=item5d721b8283:g:zvAAAOSwTf9ZP6tZ

That's not a 5mm width belt. HTD 5mm refers to the type of teeth that are on the belt, not the width. Most belts are either 9mm, 12mm, or 15mm wide

So...good news & bad news. USPS didn't pick up today, they dropped off almost 100 packages but couldn't manage to pick up a 20lb box of outgoing. If the don't pick up tomorrow I'll just skate my happy rear end to the post office and drop them off myself like a frikkin cave man 😊. 

On the up side, I found some more stuff to give away.

On the left is Hi5ber LLC Board Bumper material
https://www.hi5ber.com/_p/prd1/2105786325/product/noseguard-edgeguard
It's only about 1/4in on the inside and doesn't fit any of the dozen or so decks I have laying around, so 12 bucks down the drain. If you have a use for it PM me your address and I'll get it shipped tomorrow, prolly $3 in the US. 

On the right is an enclosure I got in eBay, don't ask me why.  It's ugly as a bag of dries dog turds freezing deep.enough to carry groceries, but if you want it it's yours.  Just PM me your address and I'll get it shipped tomorrow.  Because if the size it won't be cheap to ship, prolly around $13 in the US.

Edit: @Sapphirinia claimed the bumper.  The enclosure is still up for grabs.  If nobody claims it I might use it for a dog house or to cover my lawn mower up 😊.

I would NOT recommend this thing, hence it's free. I'f you want a good enclosure with built in concave and /or the ability to adjust the comcave check with @psychotiller. There's also ither vendors around that make quality enclosures like @Eboosted.

You can have it if you want it, just wanna make sure I'm clear that it's not good 😊

For reference, they work. 💪 Especially on the really old MBS tri-spoke hubs that are extra wide to accommodate oversize tires.

I'm not sure where to find them new in the US, since MBS doesn't list them for sale separately on their website anymore. But you should be able to find an older MBS board that has them on eBay or Craigslist for <$50-$100. I picked up an old MBS "Sol 16" and "Atom 95" off Craigslist, and they both had the tri-spoke hubs, but the Sol 16 had 12x28mm bearings, whereas the Atom 95 had 10x22mm bearings. Just try to find the hubs that have this wide, stepped profile.

And just to try to keep things sort of on topic, for anyone wanting to try a set of these 10" monster tires from Harbor Freight, look for one of these coupons. It's not exactly free, but $16 for a full set of 10" tires, tubes and hubs is close. Although you will probably need to use them with the hubs shown above, and buy a set of tubes from harbor freight that have the 90° valve stem ($4/each). So, really, it's like $35 out the door for a set of 4 tires and tubes.

[/quote]

I use hot glue to secure the panel mount to the enclosure, so I can heat it up and remove it if I want.  I use a dab of super glue in each of the holes of the panel mount to secure the XT90s connector in the panel mount.

FYI, my logic for using the resistor side as the key...  If the resister fails I have tons more and I don't have to worry about replacing it inside the enclosure.  Also, I have never one had a short by using the non-resistor side in the enclosure.

Thanks for making this happen! 

If it's not too much trouble, I'll take a few more. Like maybe 4-8 total. And not to veer too far off topic, but I could even PAY you a few bucks for your trouble. Crazy, right? I almost exclusively use loop keys, so I'd like to add these to my current and future builds. I'll even wait at the back of the line, so everyone else can get their 1 or 2 first, if that helps.

I was just going to ask what they were for :blush:

Do you think it could be modified to have a lip on the front, and some sort of bar going across the back to make sure it dosnt move? Or is it press fit and the super glue is just added security?

Yep, its a tight fit.  With a dab of superglue I doubt it will ever move.  The reason I didn't make a lip or retainer is so it can stick out a little if the mount is recessed.  If you want it modified, its not a big deal, I just doubt its necessary.

It'll come just a bit too tight to fit and will need some slight filing so you can position it really tight. 

Also a couple seconds with a hot air gun on the rear end and it'll shrink a tiny bit and lock in the connector

just pulled this remote off, it's got some issues, don't know what. throttle and brake is stuttering. luckily it's this remote, not something more serious like the esc or what else. 

if someone wants it to mess around or something, free but you pay $5 for shipping.

I shipped a Landwheel with battery and front trucks UPS gound and it was $25 only. Shouldn’t be $50. 

To whoever gets this. Keep in mind this is a LiPo battery. Depending on which generation it is, it WILL fail as the old ESC has issues. BUT the motors are great  and really powerful so can be salvaged

GEN 1 - melting wires
GEN 2 - shorting terminals
GEN 3 - “beep of death” that turns the drive off and requires battery removal to reset and fail minutes later
GEN 4 - harsh brakes that goes for 0% to 100% way too quickly

I put the wheels on my penny but they don't leave much room for the Pulley. Suggestions? I jb welded my motor mount and I've yet to get it to budget. There's room to move it closer to the center of the truck but, like I said, it's incredibly difficult to move. I used hi-temp jbweld mixed with the regular stuff. I was debating on whether it's possible to grind down some of the inner wheel. <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/4/0/40066d5736a0e037a50f8b3bd1aebee40d008b24.jpg" width="374" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/2/a/2a295c1a8c227862d80a7895e76c933290b3964a.jpg" width="374" height="500">

I would combine adding as many speed washers as you can and still have the nylon on the nylok axle nut catching two threads.  Followed by removing the inner surface of the wheel.  If you can't get 9.5mm of clearance you will have to start over on different truck, unfortunately...

Anyone need sub C NiMH battery packs?

They're rated for 3800mAh but have been used for a bit so last time I cycled them I measured around 2500mAh.

3 look physically fine, two have torn shrink wrap at the bottom, and one has a missing Tamiya connector.
All claimed!

Https://www.paypal.me/CyberonU

An fyi to everyone receiving the mounts, 1 is processed from the exterior, inside will need a bit of shaving to perfectly fit your XT90, the other is unprocessed with some support material that will need to be trimmed, can be done with a blade,file, your finger, whatever 😉

With an FDM 3d printer it will be hard to get a pulley that actually lasts *and* is press fit. Have you tried using aluminum? The threads on 3d prints are just not strong enough for any real mechanical load.

UPDATE: Already spoken for

I know I'm horrible at responding on here but I'm definitely headed to the post office today. Multiple people say my deck is easily fixable, I don't think I could do it my my satisfaction though. It was hit by a car. This is the actual board for the stats https://originalskateboards.com/product/apex-34-rocker-concave-deck/ 

If you would actually use/fix it, it's yours if you pay shipping. I'm located in New Jersey. It's a fiberglass, carbon, and it didn't specify the wood. Double kick tail Concave 34" deck. Pony grip is still on it. Holes from my enclosure are in it.

@AndyL Sounds like we're in the same boat. Paid $20 F&F for shipping of two batteries on Jan 6, but still haven't seen anything. And supposedly they're only 1-2 hours away from me. He/she said they shipped them weeks ago, after saying they were going to ship them weeks earlier, but no response to my multiple requests for tracking info. According to @dariks profile, they haven't been "seen" here since Feb. 7, so I'm not sure what's going on. 

Mods, (@treenutter) do you want to flag or restrict @dariks account until this gets sorted out? I know these are "free" items, but I'm starting to feel like at least a few of us got scammed out of "shipping" costs, which doesn't entirely make sense to me since I offered to pay $10 shipping for all 8 batteries, and Darik told me they only had two left, so they could have gotten me for a lot more.

This is exactly why unless you've dealt with someone before you never use Friends & Family.  If they insist, say okay, use a [Paypal Fees calculator](https://salecalc.com/paypal) to figure out how much to send with G&S so they receive the same amount.

It's my modus operandi

Yeah, live and learn, I guess. I went out on a limb this time. I actually did pay as goods and services first, but DarikS said the funds were being held up by PayPal because of that, and he/she needed them to ship the batteries. so the funds were refunded and I resent them as friends and family. DarikS also "offered" for me to send a few dollars extra if I wanted, to cover shipping for those who couldn't afford it. I thought it was weird that someone wouldn't be able to afford shipping for something free but I thought they were just being nice and trying to do something good for the community. Plus it still didn't make sense that when I offered to buy all 8 batteries that there were only 2 left, so why scam me out of only two batteries instead of eight batteries? And why scam me out of only shipping costs for something that's "free"? I thought some of this was a little weird, but based on DarikS post history, and activity on the forum I thought I would give them the benefit of the doubt knowing that worst case, I would learn a $20 lesson and lose a little more faith in humanity. Lol

Why is your motor pulley way out on the edge like that? That puts a lot more stress on the motor bearings.![20180324_231006|375x500](upload://ctiZwTtusG1X8xU59i3wN3wTIEo.jpg)

It looks like you would benefit from moving the mount closer to the wheel and moving the motor pulley as close to the motor as possible.  If it is biting on the wheel, then just chop the shaft a bit (put the motor itself in a platic bag with just the shaft exposed so you don't get metal shards on you motor magnets).

That's exactly why it's on the tip lol... went to take a corner (on my previous board) and it bit the tire hard enough to send me flying off the board into the grass by the sidewalk from the street lol

So after that I re-adjusted everything

Even the set screws barely clear the wheel lol if these were abecs 107mm u have barely have less clearance since these wheels actually taper from the middle to the edge

I figured that was the case. If you have a dremmel tool, it would be wise to chop that down to increase that motors life. But be sure to put it in like 2 or 3 plastic shopping bags and "stab" the shaft through so that us the only thing exposed....dont skip that step or you will wallow in regret! Good luck!

It shouldn't cost you more than $3 to ship that tiny BMS, $7 if you want to be lazy and not leave your computer.  THis is a FREE items thread, you can charge for shipping, but if you are gonna make a profit please move to another or new thread...

Yes they are bestorq.  I bought them from v-belt supply and then they wanted me to pay for shipping both ways because I calculated the wrong size plus the price of the new belts on top of the 30% restocking fee so I figuered I would trade and call it even.  I'm not quite sure what the difference in the brands are because I have seen d&d powerdrive belts on amazon and ebay.

I appreciate it brother.  It's really not a big deal, I just tend to buy in quantity and give away what I don't use.  There's also the fact that there are more than a couple of vendors that have sent me gear BECAUSE I give gear away, then I give most of that away as well.  

It's really just 2 things...
1.  I like to see people skate, it makes me so damned happy to bomb uphill and the freedom you get by being powered, its almost undefinable. 
2.  Being kind is an act or purpose, it doesn’t happen by accident.  One small act of kindness, that costs very little, could mean a lot to someone else.  THere's a lot to be said for leaving the world a better place than you found it.

These are 83mm, Orange and has Landwheel printed on them. I lagged shipping them to someone in Croatia due to no DHL near me. He’s found another source. So if you want them, it’s yours for $13 USPS Priority

I bought my BMS from @JLabs so I cannot really say if the Ebay BMS is reliable or not.
However, I'd recommend to get something a bit more quality because you dont really want to cheap out on the batteries.
If you want to bypass the BMS, get this BMS:
http://www.batterysupports.com/44v-48v-504v-12s-30a-12x-36v-lithium-ion-lipolymer-battery-bms-p-268.html
If you want to utilize the full potential of a BMS, get this one:
https://buildkitboards.com/collections/batteries/products/bestech-bms?variant=7201537753118
I'd recommend to go with the more expensive one because for only a few extra bucks, you get a lot more safety features for your whole Eboard.
Just make sure you select the correct BMS if you have Lion or Lipo.
Anyways, don't wanna get too off topic.

Damn, you're fluffier than I thought. Lol. So, you'll probably need the long deck I've got, if you want it. If you don't want it, I totally understand, since deck style/design is such a personal choice, and it would cost at least a little bit for shipping something this large (not sure how much yet). I won't be offended. I don't really want to get rid of the deck, but given your situation, it's yours if you can use it. It's this deck in red. 
https://www.skateshred.com/wholesale-blank-longboard-decks/blank-drop-down-longboard-decks/wholesale-drop-downl-longboard.html

And I've got some basically new, lime green, flywheel 90mm clones that are surprisingly soft and bouncy, that are yours for the taking.

I make the wire super-thick and soldered very well so it can be pulled on.  And, as short as possible.  Then I brush (not spray) 25+ coats of polyurethane conformal coating on it and tie a string in it.  You can pull on the string.

I have a bunch of single JST connector with wires attached. you just need to cut the two outer wires and solder together the inner two wires of both together.

PM me if you want. $3.50? shipping from CA.

OR you can just get these for only $0.75, not sure what shipping would be though.

the wires you have would work.

the JST I have is the one that fits the 4 pin port. I meant single as in there's one connector on one end only, so if I sent you two, you have to solder the wires together to have the connector on both sides.

Now to disassemble and solder on the replacement can chips on the focboxes I messed up (currently running split ppm since I removed the bad chips)

Before I buy i would want to try asking ppl here first.   I am looking for a hub motor trucks.   I have a set of maytech 90mm x50mm hub motors and last night I noticed my truck got bent.     I know Chinese sits sell them for around $25.   Before I buy it i was wondering if anyone have one of these trucks laying around and don't  need it.  I will gladly pay shipping and small fee for this.   ![Screenshot_20180629-083503|243x500](upload://89ZwYJdbSE6fkmIvtw6n1YT8ow.jpg)

The one with the gasket in the center or the one without or are you talking about the push through grommets? The ones with the gaskets have either 3,5,13 or 21 5.5mm holes in the gasket so you can just pop a hole in them and push the wire through. To answer your question they should all fit 10 awg wire

I've got a few more freebies, cleaning off my bench.  

I am going out of town saturday for a week, so they need to ship by tomorrow or you have to wait.  As always, this is free but you pay the shipping.  

I'd prefer US shipping only, customs forms are a PIA but if you need something really bad Ill make the effort.  1 item per person, gotta spread the love right :).

**Caliber Motor Mount**
seems solid, but I honestly don't remember anything about it.  I don't know what build it came off and I don't know how many miles are on it.

Never ridden, I got these in Nashville on sale and used the base plates on a set of TB 218's.  Whoever gets these can have both.

Ahh, I bought a couple if them recently. That was probably the last of his stock. 

I'm working in a mini mod and all I need is the wheel pot, so I've likely got a trigger pot you can have.

I've talked about it, just low on time. It's essentially a benchwheel style case to transplant the mini guts into with a USB chsrgeing board and a tiny lipo. 

Not too difficult, just need a new PEI sheet for my printer so I can do test runs. But it may be after Christmas before it gets here.

I've had 2, 1 was great and the other tried to kill me daily. So I got rid of both. I mostly just use the mini on cruisers, for fast boards I really like thumb controls.  

That's why I like they pick so much. It's the perfect shape with a really responsive thumb throttle.

Hey guys, this thread may be dead and this is a total shot in the dark. Im trying to build a diy board but financially its not working out. If anyone has any spare parts at all, ill pay shipping for them if you want to get rid of them or if you're willing to discount them quite a bit. I understand this is kinda lame for someone to do but who knows maybe someone will have some parts they don't want and I can make a deal with them. Thanks guys!

I have a BigBen enclosure and small deck to sell for a very low price. I’m not sure how much shipping is but I assume it’s around $20 usps priority with tracking. 

So $20 for the enclosure. $16 for the deck, if it’s shipping is more, I’ll cover it. If it’s less...thank you for your donation. 

I got the enclosure from Ben last year for secret Santa, originally it was for my 12s3p double stack which fit perfectly with plenty of room. Then the Hummie deck was available and I’m addicted to using that so this has been sitting here brand new. 

The deck is from my first mistake of buying a cheap eboard. It has a nice W concave and is actually pretty comfortable. But too small for any builds I would have these days

Happy to give this away, its slightly warped (bananas to the right a tad) yet its probs good for someone with wood/fiberglass skills, other than the warp its solid, i gave up on the job as i dont have the time or proper tools to custom/fix it. 

I'm in the UK will send anywhere as long as you pay post, i think its best if i pick, out of whos interested (if any) rather than the first to respond as it needs work and craftsmen get dibs

Those cheap eac could be paired with the same style remote.  The have 2 to 3 version of this remote.   I think the precess is push the power and hold it till it start to blink.   Than turn on the remote and push the pair button on the remote.  It's pretty simple.   The little square button on the esc also works too

You could buy an extra remote for $25 from dicky ho.

40T 12mm pullies for abec clones.

Was doing some 3D printer testing and printed four of these before realizing they were 12mm and not 15mm like I wanted.

Three are PETG and one is carbon fiber infused PLA (15%CF). The PETG had varying degrees of cleanliness as I was tweaking settings, but should all be mechanically similar. The bottoms (2nd pic) are a bit ugly, but all the teeth are totally fine.

I haven't tested any of these, but they are all 100% infill.

I can print the retainer for the opposite side of the wheel if someone wants these.

Just pay for shipping from Canada (prolly like $8 untracked to USA, similar to Canada).
