rc transmitters have more channels and are bigger and look more expensive to make. http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/__54822__OrangeRx_T_SIX_2_4GHz_DSM2_Compatible_6CH_Transmitter_w_10_Model_Memory_and_3_Pos_Switch_Mode_2_.html
Thank you!

Volume, and because e-boarders would likely pay more on their boards than they would on an rc car

What do you mean by volume? skate remote is smaller. 
Maybe there is not much competition on skate remote market.

It is easier to mass produce an RC remote that tons of people will buy. The Esk8 market is a flea compared to the RC world.
