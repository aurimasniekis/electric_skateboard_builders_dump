I'm interested in building ebike with vesc now, but the hub motor ratings are weird!

Theres no kv, but working voltage with jenky "controller box" which out puts 20amp 60volts and says it is only 250w or 500w (super cheap tho like only $20 or even less)

and so much variation...

why these hub motor is much bigger and rated so low? and why no kv?

I know EU fuked up with motor rating, that all chinese motor factory just put 250w as rating regardless, which makes even more confusing!!!!

It's because of regulations. In the EU ebike motors can't be over 250w.
