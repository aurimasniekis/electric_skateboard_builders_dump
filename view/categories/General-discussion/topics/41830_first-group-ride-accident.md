I've been on many group rides now with no incedents until today. At the end of the ride one of the boosted board riders wanted to try my friends Bamboo GT with LHB 30q mod. Well long story short we all looked on with amazment on how fast he was climbing the small bridge and on the way down around 35mph he caught the wobbles and fell with nothing more than a cheap helmet.

Lucky he did not break any bones but the road rash was really bad he ended up going to urgent care.

Lesson of the day DO NOT GO FAST ON AN UNFAMILIAR BOARD. Especially if you have never gone above 24mph... This happened because he severely underestimated the power of these boards it's no joke and I keep that in mind especially when I go for top speed runs on my Raptor.

If I’m not mistaken, the bamboo gt as all Evolve boards have sidewinder style trucks which may be good for low speed carving but they are not recommended for downhill boarding because of their instability at high speeds.
They really aren’t safe on high speed E-boards either.

The first rule of esk8 is, don't share your esk8

Do downhillers share decks?... Nope because it's not setup for them...

It's one thing going downhill with a random board vs trying out someones eboard. Ofcourse you shouldn't go full throttle with a board that you're not used to. Same with downhill. You wouldn't go full speed on a random board downhill... BUT I still think they would be ok if you tried it.

Yep I'm.very careful on someone elses board if I try it. But he only had boosted experience. My buddy rides the board np at 35mph with me he has hard bushings the other guy probably didn't know how to ride fast but he sure had all the confidence.

Yep.
If you want to try the deck, you just try the deck, with your trucks bushings and wheels.

Sharing set ups i super scary.

And when you try an unfamiliar set up and decide to go all out, you better have good complete protection.

Another perfect example of why Sidewinder trucks have no business going 30mph. Sounds like the rider shouldn't have been going that fast either. At any rate, glad he only ended up with road rash. 

Put real trucks on that rig if it can go that fast.

Sure they do ... all the time. An extreme example is a “Chinese pileup” where all the boards are put in a pile and then there’s a race to grab a board and make it to the bottom of the hill. 

I usually ride solo, but even then I’m always sharing.

Whe used to do that too. Also anything nut skate events. Where you put trucks on amything but a skateboard deck.

But the riders where really skilled, wore full protection and eased into it.

Yes and no. I have shared my board with many people without any incidents. If we as builders don't ride other peoples builds, we are losing a chance to learn... Everyone likes to use the words "Most Powerful" these days, even boosted claims this. How do you know your boosted isn't the most powerful unless you try other peoples boards?

Of course it depends on the builder to some degree. Duck taped battery packs and vescs are too sketchy for me, but if the builder seemed to do things right and isn't having issues, I don't feel like its super scared to try it.

Sharing is essential for the community to grow. How else will you know how to compare your boards vs other builders out there?

I agree but there needs to be caution this guy had no experience with a fast board, let's face it boosted boards are slow as hell he didn't have enough of a warning from the boards owner and he owned himself. I let people ride my board but I always tell them to treat it with extreme caution. I know my board is powerful because I weight double the average rider weight and I fly by these guys on rides especially up hill. So I make sure they know it's no joke.

I completely agree. Everyone should treat other riders boards with caution, cause you don’t know how it rides. But it doesn’t mean you shouldn’t ride it. :slight_smile: 

I tell people it’s powerful and you barely need to pull the trigger to get launched forward. Everyone gets the message haha. So no issues. But if someone’s doesn’t heed the caution, well, only do much you can do.

For me I can take any bit of acceleration. But if your trucks aren't setup for the rider that's what matters..it's not the board, or the difference in power. It's how your trucks are setup.

its not only about truck set up, skill and experience come into play. My truck set up is super stable at higher speeds i put my weight forward and go into a tuck but if i put my weight on my back foot i get wobbles.

Yea...that(skill) obviously but I'm 127lbs, I can't ride a board setup for 180lb rider. I won't get any leverage and I'll be fighting the bushings. It literally all comes down to a truck setup.

You can adapt to
-deck
-wheel hardness, size, and plushness/slidey feel
-tkp vs rkp
-baseplate angles

But fighting to stiff of bushings for your weight and kingpin tightness is literally where all the risk is. It's asking for wobbles. Same for to loose kingpin and to soft of bushings. A heavier rider would probably eat it on my boards.

Very true. My setup is tight as hell. Only for 200lb+ people. My wife can’t even turn on them.

I totally agree that you shouldn't just jump on and floor it on a foreign board. (Ask me how I know!) But on any given day I have a choice of about 7 different e boards to ride and they are all different.
So its one thing to say don't go flat out on another board. But another thing ro say dont ride a board thats not your setup.
Ride whatever you want and go as fast as you want. But just be aware. Things are a little different and this is a dangerous hobby. 
You pay your dues with blood and pavement.

I don't care if you are the most talented steezy awesome rider, I respect the lesser rider who slams and gets back on again more.

A lot of people who are just jumping into this game don't realise You are going to slam. Maybe not today or tomorrow.. but it will come.  Even pros slam.  Just be ready and take precautions. 
Be aware. Always.

he didn't have enough of a warning
[/quote]

it doesn't sound like he fell off because he was surprised the board could go fast... it rather sounds like he was having fun with the high speed. Warnings are for things people don't anticipate.
