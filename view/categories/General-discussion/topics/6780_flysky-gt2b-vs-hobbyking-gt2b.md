Is there any difference between the Flysky GT2B and Hobby King GT2B? 
Where do you guys get your GT2B from?

When looking for a controller i was asking myself the same question. But as they said, the same thing. I went with FS because I could source one from a local supplier rather than back ordering the one from hobbyking which was out of stock at the time.

@Pablo_702 @JLabs @racidon That's what I thought but I wasn't sure. Average  cost seems to be about $22-28?

definitely go for it, I had no troubles with it for the 20minutes I rode before my vesc was fried xD (another issue)
if you order a pre-configured VESC from enertion though I would suggest adjusting your PWM signal values as I think my FS GT2B min was about 0.8 and max was about 1.9
