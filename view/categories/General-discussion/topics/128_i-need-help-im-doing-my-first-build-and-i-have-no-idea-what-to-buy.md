Hi my name is cole. Ive been downhill longboarding for 6 years. Im now in college and i need some fast transportation. I live in west virginia and my campus  is really hilly. Like seriously all steep hills. I need a board that wont bog down on steep grade. Ive neen looking at high watt/ low kv motors because i have read low kv means more torque and watts basically means more power. Correct me if im wrong. Also I am looking at a 100 amp esc and about 10000 mah- 15000 mah worth of batteries but i have no idea what (c) 0r (s) to get. i dont really even understand what they mean. Im going to post all the parts im looking at buying and tell me if im headed in the right direction. Im looking to spend about 200-300 on electrical parts. i have all the boards, trucks, and wheels id ever want. PLEASE HELP! Give recommendations! i need it to be fast. i need it to be able to book it up steep hills and the charge to last for a good couple miles. Im also an engineering student so i dont mind having numbers thrown at me. 

Turnigy aerodrive sk3 6374 192kv
TURNIGY Plush 100A w/ UBEC Speed Controller
Turnigy nano-tech 1200mah 1S 15C Round Cell

my explanation for the batteries is that it is cheaper per mah to get a bunch of little batteries. If I run them in series and parallel i should be able to get a pretty good battery pack. I need help knowing how to do so though. I would like to be able to get 5 miles out of a charge but i have no idea how many mahs i need or what that motor needs. basically i need a lot of help.

I'd probably try to get one or two 6S-8S battery packs rather than a bunch of single cells, just because it will make charging less of a hassle.

Hi Cole, if you are going up hills get 2 6s lipo batteries and wire them in series. What trucks and wheels do you have? Don't get that ESC. Get something that can handle high voltage like this one from : product/torqueboards-12s-120a-car-esc-opto-hv/

Maybe get these motors because they come with a keyway and you could have them in a dual rear configuration: http://www.enertionboards.com/electric-skateboard-parts/190kv-electric-skateboard-motor/

If you want a beast of a ride then get a 12S setup (2) 6S 5ah packs and (2) 63mm motors. It will weigh a bit though probably over 15-16 lbs.

You can make it with (2) 50mm motors and 12S 5ah. 12S 5ah should get you about 10-14 mile range.

12S is fun though and more then enough power to climb up hills.

I run a 12S, dual 50mm setup and can climb about 20-30% degree inclines.

Hi Welcome to our forum! We will do our best to help. 

It is better to look at Watt Hours when you measure battery capacity. Nominal Voltage X Amp Hours.

For hill climbing two motors is generally always better than one. But the 6374 is a pretty big motor so if you want to stay with just one motor to keep cost down i think that is a great choice.

Higher voltage is always better.

We need to know your body weight & the max speed you want to travel. (most people with downhill longboarding experience aren't scared of travelling at crazy fast speeds - but it is important to talk about top speed to design the drive train)

im around 180 lbs. I want to be going at least 20 mph. I want to spend under 300 on my esc, motor, and batteries. I want to go with 1 really powerful motor for cost purposes. It doesnt really need to be able to go super far, but the more mileage the better i guess. basically i want a beast of a board that i can do anything with. I cant break the bank but i also dont want something that will run out of juice quick or break on me.

For our purposes, the lower the kv the better. I found in the beginning though that using gearing around 2.5:1 @ 22v I could use single 63's between 200-300 kv with basically the same good results and mostly affecting my top speed. Climbing overpasses and hills was easy and I weigh 200lbs.

My suggestion. You can go dual diagonal and use 6374 size motors which is overkill and/or you can run a dual diagonal/dual rear with 6354/6355 motors.

There are the SK3 63mm motors from HobbyKing $80/ea, 63mm BigFoot Tacon Motors $55/ea from HobbyPartz and/or Enertion 6355 Motors $100/ea.

HobbyKing - http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/__672__663__Electric_Motors-63mm.html
HobbyPartz - http://www.hobbypartz.com/96m608-bigfoot160-5335-245kv.html or http://www.hobbypartz.com/taconplanes.html

I'd pair it with a (2) 6S 5ah packs in series for 12S 5ah and/or the SPACE cell 10S pack.

That would get you the ability to climb 20-30% inclines no problem.

I currently use a similar setup but I use dual 50mm motors as the 63mm weren't necessary and were added weight for myself. I'm about 180-190 lbs.

Of course, you would have to go into detail on actual KV of motors.

That's a helicopter ESC and may function differently. You might not be able to get it to work that way. I haven't seen anyone test it nor am I sure if it would work for your application.

You would have to get a 6S ESC if you are looking for something cheaper.

csfrasher - welcome and looks like you are well on your way to getting a setup figured out.

My .02 - get the better ESC like the VESC.  I've tried a couple of the nicer ESC's and they pale in comparison to the VESC, but you will need some configuration with the VESC to make it run correctly.  It's not plug/play like RC Car ESC's (which you need to adjust as well - typically at least the brakes - usually w/ the programmer card).

If you only weigh 180 a single 63mm motor should work fine.  Especially on 8-12s batteries.  Youve said you are technical, but you need to do some reading if you aren't familiar with number of series batteries.  Lipo's are 4.2v fully charged, and x the number of batteries in series are 4s, 5s, 6s, etc.  4x4.2, 5x4.2, 6x4.2.  so a 10s battery is 42v fully charged.  Simple.  Don't over discharge your lipo batteries or you can damage them.  I stop at 3.7v but others stop at 3.8 and some lower to 3.6.  

Your budget is not really going to cut it, sorry to say.  If you have access to cnc and metal working skills, you might be able to do it around $300, but it's going to be SUPER tight.  most motor mounts are $100-150 (including motor and wheel gears, plus belt and misc bolts to assemble).  If you can weld your own, or know somewhere that can CNC you will have some extra $ for a nicer ESC or better/more batteries.  Don't forget you need a lipo charger in addition to your batteries.  A really good lipo charger (like an iCharger) can easily be over $100 alone.

Onloop just released his older motor and gear files as open source - very cool again if you have access to equipment to make your own.

Being on a limited budget i'd prioritize like so:

1. ESC - best one you can afford.  (VESC is my preferred but you need to read up on how to configure - http://vedder.se)
2. Motor mounts (if you can't make your own)
3. 63mm motor (Tacon or SK3 if on a budget, RSpec if extra $)
4. Charger (an investment - you must have a good balance charger and balance your cells!)
5. Tx/Rx - Can't beat GT2B for the price.  Later you can 3d print the Badwolf v2 enclosure and make it smaller.  I did a how-to for this [url=http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/how-to-hack-build-compact-controller-using-gt-2b-badwolf-v2-enclosure/114/12]here[/url].
6. Batteries - least important, but i'd pick better but smaller mAh packs over cheap larger packs.  You can add more in parallel later and increase range.

I'd read up the links onloop provided, plus read some other's builds to see what they did.  Start reading up on charging and basic RC stuff while you are at it - it will all help you build your own.  When on a budget like this you need to do more yourself and build it vs buy it.  Stuff will break and you will spend $ again for better gear down the road, but it's all part of the fun and learning!

HTH - GL!

I have both a Mamba XL2 and VESC.  Prefer the VESC.  MXL2 is expensive but nice programming software.  I didn't like the brakes (anemic, not confidence inspiring).  I'd love to re-use it on another board, so please let me know your setting psychotiller!?

I definitely prefer VESC - better brakes.  Handles up to 12s vs 8s.  can run traction control w/ two VESC/Motors over canbus.  Custom built for e-boards and open source (evolving and improving).  Less $ than MXL2 if you can find it (onloop has a few left i believe).

Only downside is configuring for your specific motor before use.  Can be fiddly, but once setup you can pretty much leave it alone...  I'm running one on 8s for my GF's board that still has minimal configuration (just motor parameters) and still has fw 1.02.  Works great.  Configuration equals installing the BLDC tool (Linux native) or the ported versions for Windows and OSX... hook it up correctly so you don't damage it, and read motor parameters - plug in readings into two fields, and after a restart or two you setup current control w/ or w/o braking.  Done.  If you can follow instructions and watch the video a couple times you'll be fine.

If i can do it...

beware APS - i had horrible issues w/ his dual ESC that did not perform to specs (would not work at 8s when sold as 8s ESC).  Horrendous, long, painful return process took over a month.  I've heard similar trouble with their re-branded motors and lack of support.  I personally would buy a no-name for less first.  I just ordered one of the 149kv 6374 SK3's to try out (way too long for dual, but should be good for single motor setups).

Realize that "rated" wattage of motors is usually suspect/marketing...  And that is at highest voltage it will support (usually 10 or 12s).  So unless you have a ESC that can do 10 or 12s you will get nowhere near that rated wattage.  My highest *measured* (with inline watt meter) wattage for dual motors on 8s (before i could test on 12s it was "borrowed" out of my car), was 199x watts.  So almost 2k watts w/ dual motors - that was pretty scary fast/powerful even moving me around (big guy).

I love my MM2 on my 6s board. I haven't tried a VESC yet, but I have one on order form onloop so I will have to compare when it gets here. I will say I prefer the acceleration of the castle creations esc over torqueboards 12s esc by alot... 
and programmability is more like the the VESC in terms of a computer based program that offers alot more than the usual brake %, acceleration rate, power, etc. usually found on car esc's. Being able to control the throttle and brake curve is really sweet for example. 

I will say 6s max is a disadvantage, but if you are just going for a 6s setup, I don't think (besides maybe a vesc, again, I don't know) there is a better esc to get.

Yes.  Each motor needs it's own ESC.

If you are on a budget, i would recommend sticking to one motor.  Plenty of power for a smaller/average person and greatly simplifies getting it setup.  Increased range w/ only a single motor as well w/ the same battery capacity.  You can always add another motor later!

you cant do a cheap build with multiple motors. 

the moment you double the amount of motors you might as well double the price. because you will need to buy 2 motors, 2 mounts, 2 ESC's and 2 times the batteries because twin motors chew more juice. 
the only part you wont have to buy 2 of is the transmitter.

okay. everyone is talking about how hard it is to set up the vesc. Why is it more difficult?

also what is the benefit of higher c batteries. I was recommended 20c batteries but what would 25c or 30c batteries do to the performance of the board?

and how many teeth should my gears be? I will probably ride 70mm-80mm wheels. Maybe alittle bigger

I have used 20C and 30C batteries and they both work quite well. the only difference (if any) is that the 30C maybe feel a tiny bit smoother on acceleration. maybe I'm imagining it. its hardly worth worrying about.

seriously though, are you reading the articles or just waiting for someone to tell you what to buy?

I'd look around at some build's and write ups on the forum rather than just spamming a bunch of questions: I know you just want to figure out what you need to buy, and believe me, we've all been their at some point: you just gotta do some research yourself too. 

But to answer your ratio question. If you are going with 6s, and a really low kv motor (like less than 200kv) than you might have to gear it up higher than 14:36 (that's the stock gearing for enertion's kit, and torqueboard's is somewhere around the same). Like maybe bumping it up to 16:36 or even higher depending on what top end speed you want. if you are around 245ish kv, then stock gearing on 6s is totally fine. For higher voltages, like 12s, you are going to want to get a really low kv motor (below 200kv- more like the 150-190 range) and possibly gear it down a little, but its not totally necessary. 

personally, I'd just stick to 6s, get a turnigy sk3 or a tacon160, and leave the stock gearing (if you're buying a mount and pulley together) or go somewhere around 12:36 to 16:36 depending on how high or low your kv is.
higher kv: gear down (like 12:36)
lower kv: gear up (like 16:36)
higher kv is something like a 270, 280, or 290.
lower kv is something like 190, 200, 213.
middle of the road is like 236, 245,260
these numbers are all for 6s by the way

Lol... Are you taking the piss? That's aussie slang...look it up.

Seriously dude you need to be willing to self educate... we all had to learn... everyone on here is donating their time for free and we are all happy to help... but only if you help yourself first!.

Most of your questions have been answered already in the articles. If you don't understand the articles i linked please post on that thread and ask about a specific part of the article that is not clear to you & we will do our best to explain it in a different way...

Ive read everything on here and looked at a lot of builds on youtube and on blogs. The second to last post was super helpful. I joined this to get help, and it has been super helpful. I talked to one of my professors today and I'm going to get some more help from other students and professors soon. I should have access to some pretty sweet stuff. Im going to decide what to buy soon and just go for it. I will keep you guys posted. Im going to vlog my progress when i get the parts. I will definitely keep you guys posted. Sorry for asking the same things multiple time. This is my first build like this. I have shaped many longboards, but never thought about adding motors. I have no experience with electronics, so all of your help is appreciated.

And I have been self educating, but I have also been going to school and running a business, so I haven't had a lot of time or brain space to research everything. I joined this because this is the only place you can really get good information specifically for eboards. It is impossible to find reviews on most of the products I look at and all the numbers can be quite overwhelming. Especially with Calculus and Physics and Chemistry still on your mind.

I think the point Onloop was trying to make was there are already topics to read about pretty much every question you asked three times. There's also a search function at the top right of this forum. We all have Jobs,school, kids and lives outside of this forum too. Keep in mind all the time we donated to you for all of your questions more than likely wasn't free time.

Firstly, no one should take offence or be discouraged here! Asking questions is the most important thing you can do and you should always ask question when learning any new topic.... 

but there is also some generic "forum etiquette" that should be followed... 

think of it like the genie in the bottle.

It goes somthing like this; if you are a new member who is not able to help others yet so you get to ask just 3 questions. Any question you like... but make sure it's a good one! Make sure it's not already one that's been asked! And make sure cannot find the answer anywhere else.

If you follow this rule you achieve a few things
1. You learn alot because you had to read everything to see if your question is already answered.
2. You automatically become a contributor, because the question you asked was a new one that didn't already exist.
3. You don't waste other people's time.

It took me around 6 months of reading and learning before I started my own build...

Maybe you could try the 6354/6374 motor from @ajaynagra. I haven't buyed it yet. But im pretty sure I will. The website https://eu.electric-skateboard.market/product/190kv-sensored-motor-6354-6374/ seems good, and not too expensive though.
