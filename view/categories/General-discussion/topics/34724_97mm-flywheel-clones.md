Anyone know if these two are different or if one is just a name stamped on it. Never heard of Bigfoot before.

it depends on the design of course. but for me the pulley went in words too much that the belt was touching the wheels.

not better or worse as normal clones

Buy genuine Abec11 flywheels.  It makes a huge difference, compared to clones

Would love to buy non clones if Abec would make a different color then green lol. I know metroboard has Black but they are 40 dollars more then normal green 97mm. @twan just get the clones and not the bigfoot. Bigfoot basically stamped there name on it and thats it.
