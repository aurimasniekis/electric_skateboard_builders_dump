Hi all,

Please can you link me to a motor mount (63mm) to a compatible truck and wheel pulley kit where I would need NO modification to the truck? 

Would really appreciate it

Thank you

PM @psychotiller, he has surf rodz RKP trucks with the motor mounts pre-installed.  SRs are some of the best esk8 trucks available.
