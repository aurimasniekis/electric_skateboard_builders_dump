Hey,
I'm new to the group and community and want to contribute. In reading through the content I felt like I was jumping all around, so I spun up a markdown based wiki site and picked up a domain name:

http://e-skateboard.wiki

My thoughts are we can coalesce our wiki threads as well as various learnings into the wiki in our own space. I don't claim the words, only that I stood up the site and am hosting it personally. I've opened the view access, so anyone can change whatever they see fit. This is all super raw, as the site and server are only a few hours old. I'm currently moving text and pictures from the wiki threads over by hand. All authors are being cited.

Let me know what y'all think. I'm starting the conversation early to ensure we have a need and clear all this with the e-sk8 gods :slight_smile:

Cheers!
