Morning all 

Would anybody be able to tell me what alternative PU rear wheels I can look for the Exway X1? 

From what I’ve seen, I’m “locked in” to using their wheels correct? 

Thank you

Ask @Hummie  and @visnu777. They poored PU wheels for hub motors. Hummie was kind enough to share the name of the product. Then you need to make the mold in 2 steps. Current Hub sleeve for the core and new wheels, like 90mm for the outside. Of course if you have the cad model you can also print it.

You could also cut the urethane from the rear wheels and core out some wheels of your choice and glue them to the can of the hub

I would love to do this, but I have no tools and equipment for this! Sigh, will have to use the stock ones 

Thank you though

Build them! Visnu has done a pretty inexpensive mold (but required being handy)

Really man you need the liquid PU and cups. Not that much more. Curing is at room temperature. It's not easy be precise with putting the core in the center but who did can help you out.

Look at hummie's hub thread and search for my post you will find the link and pics. Same for visnu777's threads he made a tutorial for it.
