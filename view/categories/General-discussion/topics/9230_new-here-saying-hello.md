Howdy from Austin, TX!

I gotta say, the last two weeks absorbing all this info about e boards is officially in my top 5 internet binges. Some really amazing stuff here!

Life time skater, but my family has been growing over the last 6 years so I just recently got back on the board. Then I found you guys and I'm hooked. Starting my first build soon. Gonna be converting my old Earthwing Boomerang into an e board. 

I just wanted to introduce myself and say hello! Can't wait to dive in...

Welcome.  Tons of reading and videos to watch.  Once you decide on components feel free to post everything before you purchase to make sure everything checks out.  The vendors themselves are very helpful as well (torqueboards, carvon, ollin, enertion, etc).

Hello there,

I am form Germany and very interested to build my own e board. I already browsed a lot in this board. And I really liked it ... :-D Great builds here.

As soon I find the "create new post button" I will describe my plans.

*EDIT*
The board is working with a level system ... I guess I missed a hint
