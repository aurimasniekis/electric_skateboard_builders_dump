Hey all! I have a friend who is looking to build an E-board but he is on an extremely tight budget. Browsing around I stumbled upon this-
http://www.ebay.com/itm/DIY-dual-1500W-electric-longboard-drive-kit-83MM-wheel-7-trucks-CNC-mounts-/322549102279?hash=item4b196cb6c7:g:I0UAAOSwbtVZOttQ

price seems too good to be true. whats the catch? just very poor quality? 

I may just end up buying it for science :wink:

Pretty sure this is what the Riptide R1 uses.

I'd say go for it :D

It is also used in benchwheel skateboards...I think it should work but you might have to make flat spaces on the trucks so the mount screws hold nicely...If there have ever been good chineese esk8, then it was benchwheel...

these aren't the benchwheel ones, look similar though

Probably going to pick this kit up like next week, but just realized that the motors are 270kv. My friends weighs a little over 200, will running 8s and 270kv not be enough torque? I assume the gearing ratio is like a stock 14 or 16 to 36..

@BenTheBarre Will probably be 16:48 gear ratio but not 100% sure
