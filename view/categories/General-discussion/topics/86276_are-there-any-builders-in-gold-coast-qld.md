Hey,

I live in the Gold Coast and am looking to build my own esk8 (I'm an engineer and DIY'er and long board rider) and it would be cool to actually meet a few people with similar interests in building stuff. I've read a ton of content and don't need help as such - just cool to meet up and talk about different methods and ideas. 

I see a lot of people riding around on Evolve boards (I know, I know they are the local brand), but surely there are some locals who want a beer/coffee and chat about DIY builds!

Anyway, if anyone is local and wants to meet up for a skate let me know! I did a search for Gold Coast builders but couldn't find any - If we can get a few people together that would be awesome - maybe we can start a little workshop :smiley: 

Have a bloody good day

Ive broken my ankle riding my DIY board. Some fault occurred with the focboxes and threw me off. Anyway that was 8 weeks ago. About a week after i broke my ankle my raptor 2.1 arrived so its just sitting in the box and i cant do anything with it. Hopefully i will be good within the next 3 weeks and i can come on the ride

Sorry to hear that mate.  Get well soon and when the ride happens I will make the long drive down to deepest darkest brisbane.  I get anxious when i leave the coast though. 
@onloop
Hey Jason do I qualify for a place in the group?  I've got focboxes in my build.

We don't discriminate, any board, bike, trike, or OW is welcome. Our group rides are more about community and fun, less about enertion.

@dareno nice one - Iâ€™m not actually on Facebook (deleted it a couple years ago) but will definitely try and get some people together on here.

Iâ€™m in Goldie but happily join a group in Brisbane, suppose itâ€™s not that far.. ðŸ˜‚ 

Iâ€™ve actually recently emigrated from London and Iâ€™ve just bought all my tool goodies and getting a workbench set up to build!  

@onloop whatâ€™s the rules with where to skate and not to upset anyone? Keep it to wide open public parks/quiet roads/beach paths? 

I see a lot of eskates along the beach path and most people seem positively interested when they see them ride past (as long as they are dutiful of others) - a local electric scooter shop rents out bikes/scooters/boards and says he doesnâ€™t hear of any issues.

I'm thinking we should set a date for a meet in Brisbane/Gold Coast within the next 4-6 weeks, nice early 5 am morning Sat/Sun, coffee and show off ya bits...

I'm hoping this will ensure I get mine built in good time, or I bring my longboard and gawp over others :slight_smile:

* Sunday, 28 April 2019 from 13:00-16:00 UTC+10

* Macintosh Island, Gold Coast, Queensland 4217

Come join us for a fun day out on Sunday the 28th, we'll be joined by none other than popular Esk8 Youtuber Jay Boston and long time Enertion rider Moja Reeves! Moja championed the first US Enertion Tour in 2017 and we can't wait to go riding with him again.

Location is starting from Macintosh Park, then riding to Quota Park and back all the way to Surfers Paradise Life Saving Club for a food and bev stop (and to charge of course!).
Here is the route: https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/edit?fbclid=IwAR2Sbxhia3LJuZeKpUhq5B1hMBAYl-qTpUqmw90OZF75XQShzzyfQyT7_Lk&amp;mid=1GTl9D5e6txZkUfC1Pxh2-CblpXwMAA0r&amp;ll=-27.96369610967372%2C153.41860154999995&amp;z=13

Hi I Live on the Gold Coast and I would be interested in understanding the mechanics behind building my own board. 
There is some good information but would love to shadow someone who is building their own to have an understanding.

Totally was. Was riding "The Kraken" my latest build and went off the path to allow mobility scooters to pass when I tried to go back on the path my wheels found a sand pocket and threw my off. I then had to ride 7 km back to my car at main beach. Lesson learned don't be nice to old people and wear safety gear.
