Can someone send me an XML File for an R-Spec motor that has NOT been modified.

The file must be from a fresh motor detection, before any changes were made.

Thanks!

I believe they were deleted due some issues with them not working on the newer BLDC tool updates.

I'd just run the detection yourself, referring to the VESC faq motor detection guide. You will get the same values that the XML file once had; a simple motor detection was how the values were determined in the first place!

all I need is a screen shot from the APP Config/Nunchuck screen without any modifications.

Thanks

Motor detection does nothing to the app/nunchuck parameters, only the motor tab is affected.
App/nunchuck parameters are not saved in the xml either, so when you start the BLDC tool you'll basically get the default parameters.
