Are drop through decks alright for Eboards? I take it you can just mount the trucks as you normally would on the bottom and not use the drop through feature? 
Like would either of these be fine If I just mount on the bottom?

What most people do is topmount them and then use the holes for voltage meters with sugru or a 3d printed attachment. It actually looks really cool:
