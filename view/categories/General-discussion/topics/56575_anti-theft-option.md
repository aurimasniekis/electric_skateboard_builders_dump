This option might not work if the reprobate thief has the tools and time to remove the trucks. It will ![image|374x500](upload://xUVDjyni04UL9oQrOXuckWjVwdD.jpeg)![image|374x500](upload://AaE1ifY3uIjozLJGpoYHt6WFyme.jpeg)hopefully slow the the little creature down a little. I found everything including the plastic coated cable at Home Depot.

Cable cutters are standard issue for theiving scrotes...

Hardened chain (motorcycle locks) are the only thing I’d trust my pride and joy to.

Just make two live metal strips from the battery with some good placement and noone wants to pick it up. Should be effective

This has been said before, but why anyone leave their board somewhere where it can be stolen. It really isn’t that hard to be carried.

I think you would be better off with a gold standard bike lock and a hole in your deck or a secured ring  to thread it through, that cable your using looks like it would break just by over twisting it til one of the loop clamps gives way. JMO

I haven’t come accros any place in 3 years where i can’t take my board inside. Ocf here in Finland people visit in banks only in a rare special cases. Except retirees.

I use the threat as a weapon. I leave a note on my board "if you steal my board i will rape your dog in your dreams"
No one dared so far...

I considered something similar for my bajaboard but could never feel comfortable leaving it anywhere out of my sight, mind you its so heavy that it would take at least 2 people to 'run away with it' ;)

Sorry, as a European citizen, I'm just not used to read/hear people talking of carrying a gun outside shooting ranges. Forget what I said, I do not want to keep talking about that.

Buy a husky or german shepherd and you can't lose. it'll pull the board to the destination, then guard it when you stop. Get several to increase your range :joy:
