@Skunk @Andy87 @dareno @Blitz @moon @pat.speed 

Gents. I'd like to float the idea of a night shift handover to the US day shift for the forum. We do tldr drama summaries and spice them up with random duck pics.

night shift of which time zone we speak about?
with the people you linked you can probably do a 24h 3 shift system.

@skunk should have more than enough duck pics over from the secret santa....but this is a public thread, so....

On work days, I get in super early so I can help with the transition. Almost like a good cup of coffee.
