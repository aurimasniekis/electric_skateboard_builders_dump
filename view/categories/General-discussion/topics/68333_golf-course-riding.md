Look at this stuff   the golf industry is encroaching on skateboarding.  just thought this was interesting.  At least maybe we can use some of the ideas for future builds.  I did notice they are use 4 motors like I have been telling everyone to do now the golf industry is beating us to it.  I do like tearing through the greens not for golf though. BTW the boards don't hurt the grass ![GolfBoard-4|630x420](upload://6a7SsEDzf3wzlynVORgavOJfZka.jpg)![GolfBoard-3|630x420](upload://jqgWSv19zOaKWDItOZZDMtYn9Lp.jpg)![GolfBoard-2|630x420](upload://aPtXgskax7YoXPLLx4TF0Z5X8ak.jpg)![GolfBoard-1|630x420](upload://1lhOwupKpEBb0s5lL5YHKckdSHp.jpg)

I’ve always wanted to get into a golf course to ride. I’m sure I’d get kicked out immediately. Once I slipped through a gate to a college football field. I had a groundskeeper chasing me from side to side trying to get me out.

We had a family thanksgiving thing in Gatlinburg Tennessee a couple of years ago, a big ass cabin on a golf course.  The course was closed and I got to ride all of the cart paths for 2 days.  It was mondo fun :slight_smile:.

I live in the middle of a course. It's currently seems I can ride the trails when it closes in the evenings and no one says anything. A few dog walkers and bike riders use the trails after closing as well.

Now if I started doing doughnuts in the grass and jumping in and out of the sand pits. I'm sure it's going to be a different story that ends with me outrunning a golf cart with a flashing yellow light.

Be cool, stay on path, and enjoy the ride.

Pictures. I got wild fantasies going on now, from underground bunkers to a Gopher hole.

Tried to find some, turns out I left it all on my instagram story and that's gone now. I found one clip that saved to my phone.

https://gph.is/2xsL0la

Just rolling hills, sadly most turns are banked the wrong way to force speeding golf cart riders to slow down. Spans about 200ish acres. It's actually 2 courses that happened to build right next to each other, divided by a low traffic road. I've not explored it all yet. My house sits in a little teardrop with one way in/out surrounded by the course. The golf cart path crosses that one way in/out so it's easy to get on. However the course is surrounded entirely by a moat, so getting back off is a bit more difficult.

I'd get more footage this evening, but I've got a house to clean and a 12s7p that needs welding.
