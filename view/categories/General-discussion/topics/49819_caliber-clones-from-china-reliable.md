Hey guys

I found a factory in China that sells caliber clones for 5euro/ piece (no shipping no import). This sounds to good to be true? Will this be crap or should I try them?

Someone experience with china clone trucks?

Thanks for the feedback

I tried a few and you have to prepare for big tolerances. So you need a adjustable clamp design to fit a motor mount on it, because some are bigger some are smaller..

Also make sure to check the material, some make strange, soft alloys which bend the first time you step on the board.

Third point is pivot cup and bushings - most of them are just pure shit and you should replace them as soon as you get them.

These are the points to check. If the material is good and you don´t expect high precision and replace the soft parts, it might be worth a try for a cheap solution.

The problem is they only accept orders for 100/pcs so if it's crap that would be very sad haha :slight_smile:

Maybe they let you know at least what material they´re using, or maybe you can get a sample?

I think meepo uses calib clones for the front, $12.90 with free shipping decent value

yes I did a meepo swap onto a 80's powell deck with a tail and given it some abuse, i tried wall ride and bent the washer but it didn't break or crack anything.

I did consider trying one for a belt mount in future purely due to how cheap they. Also the riser is actually rubber so usable compared to the hard plastic junk that comes with lots of cheap trucks.

Yes it is possible to be good quality, the caliber trucks are 18 euro in wholesale so production will be less than half... My guess 6-9 euros, so 5 euro might be possible

I also used them, i also honestly used the hangers on my first diy board.

They fit well on caliber clamps the ones i had, not bigger neither smaller and the quality was great no soft metal so that wasnt a problem.

The biggest problem that I have found with clone trucks that I have used is trying to replace the pivot cup. 
The standard Caliber II cup usually doesn’t fit.

For some people paying a bit more Is fine, But when others ask you how much your Diy build cost it brings a seance of shame :joy: 

Edit: Whoa we have a lot in common that explains the flooding of your topic I got a server message recommending PM good idea I think ;)

those trucks look like crap...a clone of a barely good enough truck results in a not good enough truck....trucks are too important to the ride and feeling and performance of any skateboard...I never skimp on trucks..or wheels or decks for that matter...

Caliber II's are not 'Great' trucks.  The tolerances are low, to the degree there can be as much as 2mm difference between to trucks (hangers and/or base plates).

Caliber II's are pretty good, but alot of the clones are pretty crap

Loose pivots, lopsided kingpin holes(hangar), loose kingpins, axles not straight. etc etc. Makes for a pretty sloppy truck.

as @squishy654 said, trucks, wheels, and deck are the heart of a board.

That’s just a problem with cast trucks. Until someone makes mounts for cast Rogues, Calibers are probably still the best cast trucks for speed imo.

Caliber's yes. clones no.

Most clones have lopsided kingpin holes, meaning you can't turn the same ammount in both directions, lol

Agreed, but I'm talking about the implication that Calibers aren't good trucks:

Calibers are a sloppy truck, low tolerances, no rake and a simple cast truck...there is nothing to write home about...do they work? Yup, they work fine...for what they are...a downhiill truck...I personally prefer tall bushings, and some rake in my trucks...like Arsenals, Bolzen, Don't Trip or suspension like Avenue..after you have tried a good precision truck, and understand what all the numbers mean to tune it to yourself, you would understand...It's like going wine tasting, if you haven't done it and say you hate wine, then you just don't know...but there's a wine for everyone, just gotta find it...calibers about as drab and generic and safe in all respects (a crappy white wine for beginners), a stable no rake wide downhill truck...let's say it's the perfect entry level, and understand that there's tons of better options...the only reason the eskate world uses them is because the hanger shape lends well to a secure motor mount configuration. obviously a square hanger is best for mounts, but the rest of the truck is sort of a joke, it's not regarded highly in the downhill world either..they are known as the trucks that come on complete boards...I actually spoke to Bustin once about their completes and how they wished they could use better trucks, but the naive beginners wanted Caliber and they are like forced to use them because they sell, when in reality everyone who has ridden better trucks, knows better..but hey, they come in colors right? lol I use them myself because it's easy to get mounts for them and the Hobbyking mount slaps right on securely. Do I wish they had a better feel? sure do, and I replace all the pivot cups and bushings with Riptide in all of them to make them more acceptable..but on my downhill setups, I use Arsenal due to the abundant rake, non linear feel and tall bushings which carve a lot further, not to mention I wanted 165mm which calibers don't make in cast..A narrower truck will give a lot more traction and transition in the turns faster while a wide truck is good for sliding and stability..the caliber is a decent freeride or beginner downhill truck, that's about it, once the skater gets better or they feel some rake, good bushing seats and tall bushings, they will want it..and then they will realize that calibers are just that...barely good enough...

Preach!

I love my Surf Rodz TKP's, not because they are a great downhill truck but because they are not.  They are the perfect cruising truck, stable at low and high speeds, while carving or just straight lining it, rough surfaces or not.  They are essentially above average at almost everything, hence my liking them.

I haven't measured 10k sets of trucks, but every Caliber II truck I've measured has had a measurable difference in at least one facet of the hanger from side to side and typically a much larger difference from hanger to hanger.  Frankly, I don't use them anymore.  If I need an inexpensive truck I go to TB 218's as the tolerances are tighter and you can always trim the hanger and axle and re-thread if you need it shorter.

50 Cals and 44 Cals are okay trucks. I don't get people's affinity for rakeless trucks (Calibers) when raked trucks are more stable for holding straightlines. Being rakeless means Calibers are extremely responsive the moment you apply any lean pressure. Unlike raked trucks, they have zero-return to center. This means you will end up on the ground if you don't know how to properly ride. Garbage in, garbage out.

Want to know why I designed the Banshee to use Paris/Randal clones instead of Calibers? Because I know unskilled riders will be riding the board.

Rich Nelson (rip Nelson Longboards) did a write-up of tolerances between cast trucks [here](https://nelsonlongboards.com/blogs/blog/15642889-how-precise-are-your-cast-trucks-the-longboard-truck-showdown-part-1). Most cast trucks have relatively low tolerances given that they're cast and not precision/forged, and Caliber performs at the top of the trucks tested. Is the sample size low? Yes, but the tolerances measured still aren't low enough to impact your ride. One degree of axle bend won't drastically cone your wheels. Precisions are better, but they're prohibitively expensive for many people.

As for the deviations in the hanger itself, that's a moot point. You're going to clamp down on it either way. It doesn't affect the ride quality in any way.

Given the top speeds that we can reach, I would still rather err on the side of stability. TKPs are inherently less stable than RKPs at speed because the centerpoint gets smaller the faster you go. Rake and hanger width are another question, but those are based on subjective notions of "feel".

Preach. Cast trucks have come a long way, and I do think it silly to consider them unfit for fast riding, Calibers especially. Lots of riders will beg to argue about how Calibers are "barely good". My favorite push and hard carve setup is Plugged 50 Cals put on my Dervish.

With DIYot Plugs, it doesn't really get any more precise than this. Gives precision trucks a run for the money...
