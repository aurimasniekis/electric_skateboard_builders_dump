Hi guys! I am modifying some motors and I would need the right glue for magnets and stator. I read about it but didn't find a clear answer except for the super expensive loctite 648 I believe. Is there something thermal resistent suitable for the work? Maybe something that I can use for both.
If you can share it, which glue are you using @Hummie? Since your motor are an inspiration for me 
Thanks thanks

Permabond e550 is what I use for magnets but I press the stator on. Preferred

So stator not glue, only pressed. No keyway either?

There’s a key way slot but I don’t use it as they’re such a tight press fit and then I vacuum in a thin glue that goes in the windings mailnly but also through the keyway.  Winding resin from Epic Resins

Ah ok, got it. Concerning the magnets glue I only found permabond ES550 not E550 only. Is it the correct one? The ES550 doesn't seem so much temperature resistent though

Es550.  It’s pretry unique and does high heat.

loctite 638, 648 and 680 should be good up to 180 degrees C

Thanks for the link. The only thing that for instant  loctite 648 is classified as retainer and not bounding on loctite.com. Is it holding fine?

I have used the 638 to hold the motor shaft in place that was moving all over the place :smile: hasn't moved a bit since. never used it on magnets though

It’s retaining fluid though.  Meant for attaching tight fitting cylindrical parts like bearings on shafts or housings.  I think it works through lack of oxygen similar to other of that type of epoxy like thread locker  But that might be fine w magnets. And the stator. I have no idea the difference between “retaining fluid “ epoxy and “thread holder”
If u find something better than es550 please tell me!  Being just one-part is simple and no waste(in theory). And bake cure is stress free. (Don’t overbake the magnets,again!!)  But it’s numbers are said the best by guy on phone who can talk for an hour straight at krayden I think.  Couldn’t find anything as good and told me to wait till was back in stock.  Like to see all the data sheets again.

I see thanks. Then I will but two different glues.
