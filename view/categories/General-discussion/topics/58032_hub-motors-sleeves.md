Hi all,

I’ve the M1 hubs and I’d like to change the urethane sleeves from 80mm to 90mm, the motor without the sleeve is 60mm, is there any company that makes custom sleeves? Say at 75a duro? 

Thanks!!

If you want hub motors with 75a duro wheel, buy a pair of hummie v4's. Otherwise, your not getting 75a wheels unless you make them yourself. Unless you have a lot of money laying around you want to blow (10k+).
