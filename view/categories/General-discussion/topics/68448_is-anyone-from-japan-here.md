Hey guys, I am thinking of traveling to Japan for winter holidays for like almost a month, I am searching someone to help me plan a trip as google is way too big for me :smiley:

So if anyone is willing to spend some time to help or even wants to meet up I am up to :)

I am planning something like Dec 15 - Jan 6 (13)

One event I would like to visit for sure is Comiket @ Dec 29 - 31

Yes I am based in Japan.
Just hit me up with any questions you might have!
I am located in Osaka which is close to Kyoto and Nara, the two cities with the biggest cultural heritage throughout Japan.
The Comiket is definitely worth a visit and if you are willing to travel a bit and are into small islands with subtropical climate, i can recommend going to Okinawa for some days.
