Hi Im wanting to convert an MBS All Terrain longboard to electric.  However i haven't seen any builds of anyone else doing this to this board (only the wheels).  Is there a reason nobody converts this board?  should i consider something else?

I cannot find suitable pulleys for the wheels (i don't have access to a 3d printer) and I'm struggling finding motor mounts for the trucks.  Does anyone have a universal fitting motor mount that would work?  Im very new to this.

The plan for the build is as follows

MBS All Terrain Board
Dual out runner rear Motors (looking for recommendations if this board is suitable)
Dual VESC (Need to find the best one available in UK.
I have battery sorted already (10S4P Samsung R25 pack and 80A BMS)
Need a suitable controller.

Thanks for help received.

Lots of people to MBS for electric. It's very popular. It's going to be expensive thought. So just be ready.
