So This thread is to ask a simple question... how long have you been waiting/being promised your refund from enirtion and the reason for the refund too?



.

.

.


for anyone with problems getting responses or money back on any purchases from Tesco....

**My advice.... Just do the charge back even if TESCO liquidates the company they will get away with not paying you that way too and not sending customers their items.**

**1- take out credit card,**

**2- turn over credit card,**

**3- Call your credit card and do the charge back they will get hit with the$50 fine but you WILL GET YOUR MONEY BACK!!**

**dont let them fool you they think everyone is an idiot and they can rip us off and string you along with false promises or re-using excuses they used before**

Yeah they do. Their CEO is the proud/sad owner of this forum. Come and join us at forum(dot)esk8(dot)news
All the regulars that were banned by enertion out of fear of hurting their company migrated to it. Also, many of the other regulars, me included, have been helping out on that forum instead of here

My fear is Jason may realize everyone is jumping ship to the other forum and shut down this site that houses tons of Enertion criticism and a runing history of their public fuckups.

Theres so much tasty information here and I think this site has costed him exponentially more than its made for him.

Main reason we've been migrating valuable posts to the better forum.

This forum has refused to delete posts made my members at the request of said members.

They do seem to think it's ok to delete posts when they feel like it though.

Not a single chance of that my friend.

**How would he sell items he hasn't got to people round the world, with illegal terms and conditions without this forum and the free adverts on every page (for products they dont even have)..** 

I mean come on, he needs to finance his round the world trips with somebodies money!!!!

But a majority of those advertising banners are on threads like "Is Enertion fucked? (Poll)" or "Give me my money back @enertion"  encouraging people to perform chargebacks and pursue litigation in court.  I feel like this balances the positive exposure with the negative.

I'm pretty sure if somebody stumbled upon this website and clicked on a topic titled "Is enertion fucked POLL" or "give me my money back enertion" and then proceeded to see a large banner ad thats advertising enertion and their shitty products, that they would at least be curious enough to hesitate buying and read around a bit more.

Dude!!! Guys!! I got my money back after a couple months. BUT!!!! I just got a free unity showed up in the mail!!!!?????!!!! Well I assume mistake as my money was eventually refunded. Idk. It's a sweet unit man. I have Flipsky unity and evolves right next to each other. Hands down unity is strongest construction. And I cursed them out left right up and down. I think they trying to make it right. They should be more transparent though.

that's def not them trying to make things right. Probably just some fuck up in their system like everything they've ever done. Show how unorganised their business is, they can't even keep track of orders they've shipped and orders they've refunded

FYI

The Federal Trade Commission states, ‚ÄúIf you receive merchandise that you didn‚Äôt order, you have a legal right to keep it as a free gift.‚Äù This is meant to protect consumers from dodgy companies that send you stuff and then demand payment, which is illegal. 

IANAL, but given that you cancelled your order and were waiting on a refund, anything sent to you was not what you ordered. What are they going to do? Demand you pay for it after they failed it cancel your order or even ship it close to on time?

I'd just as soon delete all this and save yourself any potential headache. But I doubt you have anything to worry about, if they can't process refunds they're not sending out return shipping labels either.

Sure, but could be argued that they had already canceled the order, confirmed by Enertion because they were flaking out on the refund even.

If it was any other company I would say maybe try and send them payment for the product but guys its fucking enertion, they're in visible financial danger and theyre still sending out unities to people that have cancelled their orders.  This is 100% on Jason and no one else.

The law aside, there are tons of people that HAVE paid and haven't received their Unity. If you keep it your keeping one that should be someone else's.

no you simply cant argue that, no matter how poorly worded the law is it does not apply to this situation it was a law enacted for a specific circumstance where people would send merchandise + an invoice, now if enertion had sent the unity + an invoice stating immediate payment then he would be able to keep the product as enertion is doing something dodgy, whereas enertion have just accidentally sent a product that they should not have. So it is Illegal and Immoral to keep it.

The next question would be if you can even get ahold of anyone in customer service and if so, would they send you a prepaid shipping label to send it back and how long, if ever, would it take them to actually get to you? If I were in the shoes of someone who had to wait all this time to not get what they ordered, and waste time to fight for a refund, only to have to spend more time to deal with fixing THEIR mistake, I MIGHT be bothered just enough to send one single email to have them provide what is necessary to just drop this in the mail, and no more. If they don't respond, or somehow drag this out beyond that one email, I'd say fuck it and move on with my life. Who knows how much time was already wasted trying to get updates and then a legit refund (which they don't do), then eventually a charge back, not to mention the anger and stress from that process. Sure the "right" thing to do would be to send it back, but I'd be damn bitter about having to spend another second of my life to fix another Enertion fuck up for them after dealing with all that. Been there, done that.

Seriously I shared a cool thing that the unity finally came. And everyone twists it out of context. Accusing me of theft even. So yeah I call u morons. That's how your acting. I have my own microprocessor prototype developer. And a pick and place machine. IE I can make Esc's. I don't need anyone else's. I ordered different ones to look at them. That's it. Be nice to actually talk to the guy who made the unity. He'd have a rational talk about the construction of the unit. Firware etc. This is the exact reason I don't have social media. I have to get back to work now ad I actually have a job too. I'm rubber your glue whatever you say bounces off of me and sticks back to you. Lol. Hahaha. Googah. Have a great day guys.

You must be smoking the same thing as Jason if you think thats even a remote possibility. 

I will go out of my way to meet this joker if he ever comes to the UK to peddle boards he doesnt own and parts he is unable to supply. He is a disgrace and for some reason this community has a problem calling this behaviour out!!!

The way he owes money still to staff and people who order boards years ago is simply not on!!!
