Hey guys,

I really like the boosted board mount bracket and was wondering if it would fit around a 63mm motor if it was custom made? and would it fit on a dual build....

Don't think the original motors are 63mm .... Mounts need to be modified or replaced with ones that can hold a 63mm motor 

If the trucks are Calibers as in the picture...then getting a mount is easy

I have Paris trucks, but i was wondering if i was to custom make some to fit 63mm motors but in the style of the boosted board, would it work?

Just wondering as i haven't seen anyone try it here

Boosted boards used smaller motors, not sure if they still do. I recall that maybe they were scorpion motors... Probably 40-50mm diameter.

I've seen these with measurements. Was thinking of adjusting some measurements to fit the trucks and motor...

I just got printed a cover for the pulley which is kinda half of what you're looking for. I do need to find/make a part to print which will be the piece right next to the belt. I'll let you know how things turn out.
