I'm at the point in my build where I'm looking for a nice deck. Landyachtz Evos get a nice rep around here for their solid decks and nice shapes, so I looked around for one. I wanted a longer deck to fit my 12s5p, but all I could find were the 36" Evos. The 39s I did find were super expensive. So I started looking for an alternative and I found this:
https://www.skateshred.com/wholesale-blank-longboard-decks/42-x-9-5-drop-down-blank-deck.html
From Skateshred. I've heard their decks are solid, and this particular one has a similar shape to the Evo with 9 maple layers. They also very prominently show the wholesale discount. I'd like to see if there are enough people who want a deck like this for someone to arrange a group buy to take advantage of this discount ($10 off each deck if you order 10 or more!).
Let me know what you think. Would you get one?

I'm really sorry but group buy can only be organise by level 3 member. 

@moderator

@Allofyoush If you want you can still organize a Group buys, but you need a level 3 member to handle the financial part of it.

I mean, yeah it's $35, but at least it's not $130.

Im only asking if anyone wants to get it for $25. If someone here has one and thinks it's good quality, that would be a pretty good deal

I didn't mean I would actually do it, I meant I wanted to see if I could get enough people to say they want it for a regular to get it together. I'll edit the wording so it reflects that

```
usually people use [gauging interest] or they ask someone of higher standing to host the group buy(I dont think this has happened yet, but if someone were to be interested in this deck and the idea of a group buy, they would probably help you peruse it )

Seems alright, maybe make a poll to see who is interested, this way you have a tally

![image|690x355](upload://vS2p0GfQ5tGXd4smQGpchGOusIV.png)

do it in the OP

You should make the voters and other stats available to the public, it might influence some new people to put down for one

you do realize someone will have to ship these out right? and that shipping cost in the US is going to be at least $20.

Hmm, no I hadn't considered that. So I guess the difference in price between getting the discount yet sending them individually to people who get them would be inconsequential?

It's already $35 for one..... 

Ive never shipped a deck for less than $18. And it was much smaller lighter. 

Who ever does this would have to deal with repackaging and shipping. 

I understand you wanna save money.  But doing group buy on the cheapest of the cheapest items is pointless.

I suppose you're right. I guess it just makes sense to ask whether or not such a cheap deck would be good at all. It seems well enough designed, but do you know anyone who might have one who would know how good it is?

Skateshred seems to be legit. Looks like a pretty good budget deck site!

Skateshred is legit Iâ€™ve gotten some cruiser wheels from them for a kidâ€™s board I did. $35 isnâ€™t bad last time I sent a board out to Texas it was $16. The decks are made of Chinese veneer but from what I have heard they are over all solid.
