Hi all-

I am interested in planning a group but for the maytech steeze remotes, but I am not a "regular" yet. Is anyone interested? If so, should I wait for "regular" or could someone create the thread for me?

Thanks,
Declan

you should make sure theres enough people interested to even bother....

if you just want a remote, lhb has them in stock.
Looking at the pricing, a gb discount won't be that much after shipping and fees and all...
