Hi all, looking for some advice on helmets before I pull the trigger.

I currently have a standard triple 8 brain saver (which, can I add, saved my brain recently). I also have an Oakley Mod5 snowboard helmet and it's very comfortable and fine on the slopes but frankly looks stupid on a board.

I'm considering a TSG Pass but I'm concerned about my awareness while using it, I've not really spent much time in my adult life on bikes or needed to use full face helmets for any other application so I'm not sure how much gets taken away with it on. There's no where local to me that I can test the pass.

Can you still hear traffic well? Do you find the framed vision ever gets in the way at all? 

I'll take some pics of my triple 8 tomorrow, it's outside in the car atm and I have no pants on. I basically hit a groove in the road on pneumatics from an angle and the board went one way and I went the other, it all happened so fast and before I knew it I was on the ground, got some mean road rash on my elbow, hip and my neck muscles were tender for days. Helmet crunched off the ground on the back, small but deep gouges that would likely have put me in hospital. Now I'm concerned about the front of my face, I'm really pretty.

Any advice welcome please.

i also come from a background of bikes and tiny helmets and i tried the TSG pass and didnt like the visibility or the sound.   i do like the berm helmet with a small visor (which is pretty functional).https://www.rei.com/rei-garage/product/141553/bern-team-watts-bike-helmet-mens?CAWELAID=&cm_mmc=PLA_bng|404_120360||none|c5b831c4-08ea-42d5-875a-9187937c477f|pla-4584757331141708&kclid=c5b831c4-08ea-42d5-875a-9187937c477f&gclid=

cheap.  and most importantly it fits very nicely and comfortably.  no obstruction of sound or view.  looks pretty nice

i have fallen off and banged the back of my head HARD.  not even a bump or headache and i still use the same helmet without worry.

if you normally wouldnt be wearing glasses when riding this things makes even more sense.  a bug in the eye at 30 sucks.  but all those straps and buckles on top of glasses especially and i think id have a freakout.  the tsg pass takes like 30 seconds just to get it on

I freaking love my pass, during rides I sometimes flip the visor up to look at hot chicks then flip it back down when they're looking...jk

But on a serious it's very nice and functional. One of the few helmets that fits even though I have a head of dreads. I could hear cars approaching from behind in the city and it was very breathable. I also felt very secure

I can hear very well in traffic with the TSG Pass, enough to hear people around me and cars coming. There is a little meshed hole next to the ears. Obviously you will never get great sound with a full face unless you just want to listen to yourself talk.

Visibility is also great, you have to remember these were designed by downhill skaters who needs that visibility. I have Bell Super 3R before and that was a great helmet, but it takes a lot of work to look down because the chin bar gets in the way.

The gold one looks so nice tho. I just replaced my purple one after a hard face plant and although the helmet still looks fine I replaced it anyway. The one issue with the Pass I noticed is that the visors scratch super easily and cost $50 to replace, good thing it comes with two. 

It's breathable and has good airflow but in the summer when I stop I need to lift the lid to not drip sweat, dunno how hot it gets where you live. I also think it helps attract attention from drivers which is a plus.

Coming from a long time Pass user, I don‚Äôt find anything wrong with the visibility. I can also comfortably wear glasses and carry on a conversation with it on. 

Granted I haven‚Äôt tried other helmets, but I haven‚Äôt needed to. In the end it‚Äôs your personal preference, and if you happen to want a large white Pass let me know!

I only had the Pass helmet on maybe 2 minutes.   the chin strap wasn't as easy as a typical buckle and for sure not as easy to hear compared to the half helmet bern.  the chin pads were not as nice as not having them to me.   Pass has "good" visibility but for sure a half helmet is better.  actually if youre in a tuck the bern is harder to see ahead but still rather take the bern.   a serious fraction of the cost and no visor to scratch, and no obsession necessary to keep it from scratching, and I feel like the bern is good for multiple hits while I think generally people with the pass toss it after one hit. The bern felt like it could take a bigger hit.  I was shocked by how well it took a really bad hit with me..and still using the same one.

Lol I'm still confused how visibility is better on a half cap. I can't even see the Jaw with my pass on i literally just see the top brim like a half cap.

Reusing any helmet after any hits is just risking your own safety.

what about 'scrapes n scratches' the kind of thing when you spot after a fall there's a mark but your felt no impact? I'm using mine after one of these - now rethinking that little

It really depends, and I don't want to be the one making a decision for others. But 

- outer shell scratches can turn into helmet cracking on next impact
- if the impact was hard of soft and your brain bucket sports MIPS, the membrane is likely shifted
- the foam inside compresses with any impact with your head in the lid. The foam never uncompresses, and looses brain cushion effectiveness for any future impact

I personally won't even wear a helmet if it's been dropped. Can walk away from most injuries. Can't walk off a TBI. So I leave the decision to the wearer, as I cannot form a valuation of another's own importance.

 Thom Parks, who has overseen testing, standards, and safety at Bell Sports since 1998, including now its in-house testing lab, the Dome gives his answer as to the most important ways to know if an EPS (common) helmet is still good:
#1. How Does the Helmet Look?

If and how hard you hit your head is going to make a big difference in whether your helmet has been seriously damaged. Parks suggests starting your decision with a thorough inspection. ‚ÄúYou can do an inspection or send it to the manufacturer, who can do a very good inspection to see if that helmet was damaged,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúIn good light, check the inside and outside of the helmet, and look for evidence of crushing or cracking.‚Äù

If there‚Äôs minor crushing, you may not have to replace the helmet. ‚ÄúIn reality, the next accident probably won‚Äôt hit in the same spot,‚Äù Parks says. ‚ÄúFor the most part, a helmet that‚Äôs crushed a little bit is probably going to work fine in the next accident, but it‚Äôs dangerous for anyone to make that statement, because we don‚Äôt know what that next accident is going to be.‚Äù
TGS pass is made of EPS

I disagree and you dont have to replace your helmet every time you go down  

  As you pointed out in your video it wasn't just minor cosmetic damage.  on the outside it maybe seemed so but inside it was compressed on the side you hit.
the fiberglass being compressed...that's ok.  the foam liner becoming unglued...you could reglue it.   the compression is the only thing that in my mind warrants probably replacing.

youre obviously salty now and aren't open to discussion but I have to get in my cents if youre going to run off like that with big claims and insults.   glue is just glue and its not in any way protecting your head.  it is holding the stuff that does protect your head in place.  and fiberglass can flex.  it does that without cracking and will rebound to very close to its original compression ability.  you write like you think you know it all but theres many other people who will disagree with you.

Name calling? Did I call you a name? No I said your statement was dumb. Big difference.

Regluing an adheasive that is designed to break away in torsion? Is it gonna break away with you gluing it there?

$300 for peace of mind, vs potentially life altering event. 

I am not here to argue, nor will I continue to say anything further, I have already said use your own discretion, and said so from the beginning, as it is your noggin, not mine. 

You even asked to buy my beat ass helmet and I wouldn't sell it to you, because I don't trust it, or your decision making. Your brain bucket, will not be at any fault of mine. And I will not argue with you, as I have already made my points. 

Decide your own safety, and don't suggest such asinine things to others.

Back on topic :) I find that a good fullface actually makes less wind noise than bare head or half helmet, so you actually hear better when you get some speed. On motorcycles I even wear earplugs, as danger noises still get througt but nuisance hearing destroying noise is better controlled.

And the face shied definetely helps with dust and whatnot, improving my vision.

I don't know how many times I have to say this. Use your own discretion. My personal decisions do not effect you. If I drop a lid, it's getting replaced. I could care less if anyone agrees with that point. It's my dome piece. 

And yes, regluing a helmet liner on a damaged helmet is asinine.

Respect for that man. People in todays world will try to make money on anything without giving a single shit about others.

And @Hummie, I'm not here to argue either, you're a cool dude, but re-read what you're saying. If a helmet was designed to shift during impact, glueing it back will not allow for the same structure/function. Compression in helmets is not the only protection. 

If 1 cell in your battery pack fails, you won't replace it with a different type, right? The battery will most likely work, but you'd be risking instability. Same with helmets, you never know when you could crash. So why play with your safety? Unless you wear a helmet for the looks ofcourse.

actually I offered to get it from his trash.  

looking through what places say about replacing helmets you can see a whole spectrum.  on the one side you have the sticker and manufacturer and safety organizations saying throw it out after three years or have anything happen to it.  but I don't trust that point of view and call me cynical but I suspect they want sales.  and then you have this guy quoted here who in my mind is more an expert than anyone since he's been testing for like 20 years saying the most important thing is just to look for damages and really a  a damaged, indented, helmet is still good as long as you don't hit in the same spot.  https://www.outsideonline.com/2257271/how-tell-if-you-need-new-helmet

as far as a liner that has moved I think they label things for marketing sake and to make it seem more complicated.  sure the liner moving in the helmet might reduce the shock but if the foam isn't compressed and the liner is put back where it started you pretty much have the same helmet.

@Hummie 

"If there‚Äôs minor crushing, you may not have to replace the helmet. ‚ÄúIn reality, the next accident probably won‚Äôt hit in the same spot,‚Äù Parks says. ‚ÄúFor the most part, a helmet that‚Äôs crushed a little bit is probably going to work fine in the next accident, but it‚Äôs dangerous for anyone to make that statement, because we don‚Äôt know what that next accident is going to be."

This guy is saying hey, you could probably use it again, but it's less safe and if fuckup and get in an accident in the same way again it's not going to protect you properly.

Personally my brain is worth > 300$ to me.  And 4300 isn't really that much cash to me compared to the risk.

I wouldn't say esk8 is a cheap sport.  And riding without proper protection gear / taking measures you can is not an intelligent move.

Cheaping out where it comes to your safety is dumb.  

Manufacturers say you should discard the helmet after an impact.  So discard or make the helmet into a cool wall ornament after impact.

call me nitpicky but perfect ventilation would be no helmet and there's degrees under that.  hearing is obviously impaired as your ears are now contained in a fiberglass shell.  and yes huge viewing angles but those are not as big as if there were no frame at all of course.  I can see my nose so I can see the full face helmet when its on my head.

Sure.  If you want to be nitpicky adjusted for you -> "IMHO ventilation is perfect".  And no.  I'd say that the viewing angles literally impair my vision in no practical way.  In fact as OP later stated it improves vision at high speeds because I'm not squinting. 

As a plus on sunny days it has built in sunglasses :)

Where can one try out a TSG pass? Should I be looking in a general sporting goods store or are there only specific companies that do distribution? (in the US around Chicago if that helps) . I‚Äôd like to get one but don‚Äôt want to throw down so much cash if it doesn‚Äôt fit well.
[/quote]


I've got one and am in Southern michigan. Def will be tripping out to chicago at some point this summer.  I'll def bring it along if you want to meetup and try it on.  It's a Pro Large

Their measurements on their website are spot on.

The carbon pro does fit a size smaller than the normal TSG pass

I'm not ignoring it.  his statement tells completely about the materials and what they do.  if i have a crash and see no signs of compression its totally good according to this logic.  if it does show compression then its not as good at taking a hit in that spot.   my overall point is there's nothing fancy going on and its a piece of foam that gets compressed.  if it hasn't been compressed, it can be compressed.

i think I'm going on about it because you take the strong other end of the spectrum, which might even be following the sticker and what places will say, and theres an assumption its no longer good but without any visible evidence

to me, based on what this guy says, if it looks good its good.  and i don't mean the nice pearl gloss purple finish

"if i have a crash and see no signs of compression its totally good according to this logic"

If you have a crash, and your head hits the ground inside the helmet, the force is going somewhere.

Ideally into the helmet.  That shows in the form of foam being compressed, the shell being cracked etc.

After it's used it needs to be discarded/replaced.  Not reglued.

You're right.  This isn't magic.  It's really simple.  When you compromise the integrity of the helmet, yay!  It did its job.  Discard helmet.  Buy new helmet.

I disagree and the only part that matters is the part you cut from the quote which I added again below

Parks says. ‚ÄúFor the most part, a helmet that‚Äôs crushed a little bit is probably going to work fine in the next accident, but it‚Äôs dangerous for anyone to make that statement," (since when are statements dangerous anyway)
MODERATORS!!! STAT...but then again i think its worth knowing and not dangerous info at all.  maybe save people thousands of dollars in expensive full face helmets they throw out needlessly

Q: What Do I Do If My Helmet Becomes Damaged?

A: Helmets don‚Äôt last forever. If the helmet is visibly damaged (cracked outer shell, crushed or cracked foam liner or any other damage) don‚Äôt use it. Some or all of the helmet‚Äôs protective capacity is used up when impacted, and the damage to a helmet is not always visible.

Hello. I am using the Daemon Podium full face helmet. It was made for BMX/downhill. It has been very comfortable to wear. What are the downsides to this style of helmet - or asked another way - what makes the TSG better?

edit - wanted to post a photo of the podium, but not sure how to pose photos here.

Mtb helmets are actually pretty good,they have a wide FOV. The only downside I see vs a pass is most DH mtb helmets don't have visors(face shields). Otherwise they are lightweight, and provide great ventilation and FOV just like a DH LB helmet

My personal taste and not pissing on anybody's chips is, the TSG pass is a bit to inclosed and probably more about form than function, ive said it before but i much prefer the Met Parachute or Fox Proframe with shades but, im more mud and grass than i am asphalt and concrete.

the TSG pass is one of the most cleanest helmets you can buy, design wise it's pretty small and slim compared to bulky snowboarding/motorcycle/mtb helmets.

if you're gonna be going fast on a board, consider investing in a helmet designed for that particular thing.

the pass has 0 % hinderance on your vision, the way it's designed is quite perfect. when you have it on you literally cannot see the helmet at all, it almost looks as if you aren't wearing one at all.

worst part of their helmets is the D loop. which can be fixed by buying an "echo quick release buckle" from amazon, makes it much easier to clip on and off in a pinch.

and the helmets do run a bit small, so i would probably go through amazon and just make sure you have that hassle free return if it is indeed too small..

i'm usually a L in helmets, but in TSG a XL is a somewhat snug fit.

Advice?  _Check the impact ratings!_  Don't buy what random people on the internet say- get the test data!  Otherwise you might end up with a Bern helmet that isn't skate certified, or a snowboard helmet.  As for vision, the chin bar only gets in my way when I'm looking down at my jacket, etc.  Traffic audibility is about the same, because all sounds outside the helmet are reduced about the same. 

The following skate and bicycle helmets are the only models that have additional impact certifications beyond the legal minimum to be sold in the United States as bicycle helmets (the CPSC test standard).  There aren‚Äôt many: 64 helmets from 25 brands.  These are from the [Bicycle Helmet Safety Institute](http://helmets.org)‚Äôs lists from 2018 back through 2016.  If a helmet is not listed here, to the best of my knowledge it does NOT have that certification.

**Skate and Downhill Bicycle Certified - Full Face with Face Shield:**
Triple 8: Racer -  the only helmet with skate and downhill certification

**Downhill Bicycle Certified - Full Face with Face Shield:**
Zero Gravity: Vector M-5. (The Vector M-6 appears to be a newer model; certification unknown.)
TSG: Pro Pass, Pass

**Downhill Bicycle Certified - Full Face without Face Shield:**
6D: ATB-1 2017
100%: Aircraft (MIPS)
Bell: Super DH (MIPS and removable chin bar), Full 9, Transfer 9
Giro: Switchblade MIPS (removable chin bar), Disciple MIPS, Xult, Xact, Cypher (2016)
Lazer: Revolution FF (removable chin bar) (not Revolution)
Bluegrass Eagle: Brave, Intox
Fly: Werx Ultra
Kali: Savara
Leatt: DBX 6.0 Composite
MET: Parachute
O‚ÄôNeal: Warp
POC: Coron
Shred: Brain Box
Specialized: Dissident 
THE Industries: T3 Shield, T3 Carbon (2016)
Triple 8: Invader
Troy Lee Designs: D2, D3, D3 Carbon MIPS
TSG: Advance, Advance Carbon

**Skate and CPSC Bicycle Certified - Full Face with Face Shield:**
S-One: Lifer Full Face

**Skate and CPSC Bicycle Certification - Open Face: [helmets.org/dualcert](https://helmets.org/dualcert.htm)**
Triple 8: Gotham (also version with MIPS), Brainsaver Dual Certified, Lil 8
Bell: Local, Trans, Surge, Exodus, Shield, Maniac, Psycho, Injector, Bike Candy, Segment, 
Full Flex, Reflex, Ramble full face for kids
POC: Receptor +
Shred: Bumper Light
Vigor Sports: Audio (speakers in helmet)
American Safety: ASHP Safeguard 11
Top Gear Helmets R Us: Model 18, Model 38
S-One: Lifer, Kid
Nutcase: Street, Little Nutty
Punisher: Pro Series Neon
Pro-Tec: Full Cut, Classic (NOT ‚ÄúClassic Skate‚Äù or ‚ÄúClassic Full Cut Skate‚Äù)

Leatt also publishes independent impact test results for their helmets.

Here‚Äôs a quick comparison chart of different test standards: [https://helmets.org/stdcompsum.pdf](https://helmets.org/stdcompsum.pdf)

If you have more certified helmets to include, please share!

I hope consumers consider the impact performance data when deciding which helmet to wear.

anyone what the best full face helmets that you can easily mount a light on for night riding.  I'm not sure I trust most of the lights that will fit on most boards for distance awareness.

Thus, I'm thinking a good bike light that can be mounted on top of a helmet.  Possibly strapped as you can do with a lot of standard bike helmets.

The (American) Bicycle Helmet Safety  Institute at helmets.org lists that helmet, but does not list it as having the ASTM F1592 downhill mountain bike impact certification. The SixSixOne website doesn't either (as far as I know, none of the Bravo Sports helmet brands have that rating). There's no evidence that it meets that impact standard (as the ones I listed above do).
I'm not familiar with the AS/NZS 2063 standard test speed, but the CE 1078 isn't as fast as the CPSC, which isn't as fast as the ASTM downhill test.
