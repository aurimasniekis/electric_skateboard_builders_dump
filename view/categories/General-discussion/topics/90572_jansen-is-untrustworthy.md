I was reluctant to say anything because im not in the habit of name and shaming people, but at this point I figure I might aswell throw it out there so others are aware of his behavior and don't make the mistake of trusting him.

@Jansen asked me to print him the nano-w remote. I was prompt in my response and he agreed to the terms and price of the transaction. I ordered the custom color filament he requested and quickly sent him his remote shell. Upon providing the tracking info, I sent him the request for payment via paypal. This was 5 days ago and sense then he has not responded to my messages despite logging in on a daily basis. I will not be providing him with any of my services regardless if he offers to pay in advance from this point forward.

I thought it was typical to pay in advance for anything on this site

Im an honor bound individual, sometimes to a fault. I would never send big ticket items out before payment but a $15 dollar remote isn't going to bankrupt me. It's not a huge deal but enough to warrant a warning to anyone else who might do business with him.

He wanted to buy my Evo and deaded me twice before I gave up trying to re-establish contact with him, once when I had already gotten to the post office :I 

The only thing to be taken away here is get payment first... Unfortunately being trustworthy just makes you a target on the internet :thinking:

[quote="Sn4pz, post:9, topic:90572"]
is get payment first
[/quote]

unfortunately I need to agree with you here.

It¬¥s not the first and only case people ordered and got things shipped, but didn¬¥t pay for it after.

We are a community and should hold together here, not rip off others. The same if I sell something used I should make clear if there is a damage, so that the buyer know about it. 

As buyer you always have the papal claim as back up, but if you trust somebody as seller that you will get your money later you just fucked... 

I can¬¥t say about this case, maybe it¬¥s really just a missunderstanding or what ever, but I know about one other case where people come away with it and still on here. 

Really, what to make best if you understand you got rip off?
To go all public, always? But that would give a risk of a shit show again, so maybe better no... Maybe to report things like this to the mods should be the way to go. Idk...

I agree, the only reason I spoke up was to provide my experience( I'm not saying that you're coming at me) 

I would have posted previously, but didn't because although getting to the post office is a hassle to me, that's all it is. 

Imo @redbaron is (if everything adds up) completely in the right here, but it's unfortunate that it had to be made public. 

Jansen apparently browses the forums and only responds to PM when he feels like, and I feel like all vendors who make their products to order should have the knowledge available

He had contacted me about doing a board and I asked him his location because I would rather keep the shipping in the US for now and he said he was in Cali but then never got back to me so I just figured he had left the forum.

WTF? Huh. Are you talking about me @RedBaron?? I had my assistant paypal you last week and the remote arrived the same day...? LMK otherwise....? Was going to ask you about doing a couple more prints of a couple of others things needed and just saw this rather confused. LMK.

And really bro? @RedBaron It's $15 guy, and I ordered it to be paid, Sorry I haven't checked PM's for the weekend. Like really bro? If you haven't got it just lmk and I can check on it. 

And yes @Eboosted  I have something I am dealing with @torqueboards where I did nothing but as instructed and talking with him and even told him I would refrain from posting further on the situation here to hopefully resolve it without needing to do so and was being the bigger person.   

Sorry I don't stay glued to checking PM's daily fellas. I love eskate and all and look around every other day or so but don't always click notifications or PM's and just look at recent post a lot of times. Holy Christ you guys are vicious. Fuck. 

I've never not paid for anything in my life and would have paid in advance if asked. Please clothes this slander for lack of checking PM's and ill make sure @RedBaron gets his $15 if my assistant never did it.

The only way to get a hold of you is through messaging and I did that. Here's proof.

@RedBaron Sitting in her "to-do" stack still, let her know when I giver payments they need to go right away. Sorry bro, didn't mean to make you go broke, wanted to ask for a few more prints of different items but I won't burden you now after this. Didn't mean to make you feel this way, yikes. Appreciate the print and thanks again for it, feels great after spending an hour or so smoothing out the trigger with my dremmel this weekend cause it kept sticking and getting caught really bad how you sent it. Feels perfect now. Psycho tiller even dropped it yesterday on accident at his house and not even a scratch on it.

Never said you didn't just that I hadn't looked. I gave my assistant shit for it. Never seen people post names like that really on topics so yeah I would consider it slander on some level. All good bro, you wanted your money, I get it.
