If this isn't the appropriate place please move or delete.
I'm curious what everyone's hoping to score on Black Friday/cyber Monday. 
Have you heard of any special deals, any rumors your expectations? 
Any vendors to keep an eye out for?
Or maybe some vendors want to drop some hints as to what they might be putting up for grabs?

I would also like to have the raptor hubs but I'm concerned regarding both quality and delays. 
I know they fixed a lot of issues but we haven't really seen how it performs over time yet. 
If they give some kind of warranty it would be great but I think it's unlikely since it would be used for DIY builds?


Can't wait to browse between all the black Friday deals! I'm so excited üòÅ

@Bjork3n @bigben @Bor.inc

We will have discounts up to 50% :slight_smile:

Best deals will be on mechanical parts like: o'tang abec11 wheels, caliber trucks, mounts, pulleys, belts, decks, bearings, griptape, ...

I'm still thinking about discounts for motor's/controllers

I will post a final list on instagram a couple days befor black friday :slight_smile:

I need this thread to help me make my own list.

SR tkps without a doubt, I'll be so bummed it they don't go on sale. @Sender seeing as you already pester them daily for baseplates could you chuck a suggestion in for $10 trucks please üòÅ

I'm on the fence for raptor hubs, not sure if I can handle the inevitable drama.

Little things though. Bearings, bolts, loctite, inner tubes, small tools like dremel attachments and bits. The big stuff is great but I think we'd save a fortune if we also stocked up on essentials.

Last year Enertion had Focboxes for 100 so maybe since they are trying to phase them out they will do a better discount on them.  Just for the love of god don't do a freebie that holds everything up.  I would love some surfrodz.  I know muirskate usually does 15-20% off for black friday/cyber monday.

I think you should learn how to actually build an electric skateboard. Not just how to put it together. I think it‚Äôs much more satisfying when u build your own board from scratch and it works for the first time.
Just my opinion

If you buy a kit from TB, it should be bolt on, no fuss.
If you wait for BF deals, you need to know exactly what to look for, each specific part. That what he means, to do research of what is available and what goes together nicely. When you have this knowledge, you could invest the same money than the kit and find maybe better parts.

Got the info that alien power systems @ALIENPOWERSYSTEM1 is doing a Black Friday week. 20% off all products just enter the code ‚ÄûAPS black friday ‚Äû when checking out.
The bigger motors which out of stock should be available mid of December.
I didn‚Äôt asked when the 63xx motors back in stock, maybe @ALIENPOWERSYSTEM1 you can say us for which time they planed to be back in stock?
They also have battery packs, lipos, remotes etc. to sell so maybe it‚Äôs interesting for one or the other

@MBS, while you are here, may I ask you if it is possible for MBS US to ship internationally? There are no resellers around me and actually, USA is probably the closest.

Our site (mbs.com) won't ship outside North America unfortunately.  
Send an email to orderprocessing@mbs.com (CC: customerservice@mbs.com) with what you want and mention the discount codes (per Joel).  They'll sort something out for you.
