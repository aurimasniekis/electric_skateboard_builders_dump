I am on the final stretch of putting everything in its place for my trampa deck build. One question that I am having trouble answering is what are you guys using to keep things in place in your enclosures? And fill up any negative spaces? My guess is some double sided tape to hold electronic in place and then maybe some type of foam to keep everything snug? Or is hot gluing everything in place the solution and not using anything to fill up negative space better? 

Am I on the right track? 

My enclosure needs to stay flexible because its a bottom mounted enclosure for a trampa deck.

General rule is NOTHING should be held by the enclosure. It should all be fastened to the deck. The enclosure is just a shield. I use foam shims to fill the negative space.

It depends, like how am I gonna deck mount 13s10p and ride hard? Everything would just fall off

My only option is fiberglass enclosure mount

You ever tried Industrial strength velcro? It holds a metric f ton and gives decent vibration protection as well.

I use this "Dual Lock Fasteners". After letting it set for 24 hours, I can probably pick up my entire build by the battery pack if I wanted to.

Not the actual question the OP asked but how do you guys actually fill up the empty space.  What i really want is to remove the hollow sound you hear when going over bumps

What hollow sound are you hearing? No enclosure Ive had makes a hollow sound 

Maybe theres something bouncing around? The reciever?

Ive seen on a FPV drone forum that using a heat gun on these to warm/loosen up the adhesive makes it a vastly superior product

Havnt tried it myself though :man_shrugging:

Don't heat gun for too long it melts the dual lock

I would hope that whoever tries it takes care to not melt the velcro :joy:

You have to go with the legit 3m or velco stuff  I have had "industrial strength" and I was able to pull it off no problem.  I laid my battery on my board and just slightly off and it was a bitch to get it off to align it just right on the velcro.

Yeah well you also tried hot glue so maybe user error? I ride in the woods and havent had my pack budge.

OP ideally fill it with something light, non conductive, and not flammable

Did you use some foam to close up the space between the battery and the enclosure? If you do that the velcro would get no/less gravity pull. Like this:

You
Deck
Velcro
Battery
Foam
Enclosure

I have no space for velcro in my setup. I use 3D double sided tape. But careful Itâ€™s practically impossible to get the pack off.

You have empty space in your enclosure? I've never had that happen... hahaha  I second @DerelictRobot though.... your battery isn't big enough.... lol.

I will screw my parts to the enclosure and or lock them down with some 3d printed holders. The lipos will be attached with Velcro strips to the enclosure preventing them sliding around. Nothing will be fixed onto the deck ....

People have done... lots... of things in the past. Why create a failure point? 

What's stronger:

-Your deck \
-That enclosure

"Mount to the sturdiest point" applies in 99.9% of applications.

You do you brother, I'm just here to help people ride as long as possible. I hope your enclosure is water proof. If any water gets in, it's pooling on your battery and/or esc :man_shrugging:

Usually, I donâ€™t ride in the rain. Enclosure will be splash water proved with a nice urethane seal around it. The Evolve enclosure is sturdy enuff to protect the electronics. At least I havenâ€™t seen a single case in the past years where this particular enclosure was falling apart under normal use.

Yoga foam blocks are cheap. Cut with a hacksaw to size and shape. Fill the emptiness.

From what i have seen use velcro to hold every thing in place and use thick or multiple layers of foam tape to the open spaces
