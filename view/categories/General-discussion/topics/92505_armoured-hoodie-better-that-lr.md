Everyone is talking about the Lazyrolling hoodie but why have that [when you can have this bad boy.](https://www.banggood.com/Retro-Protective-Elbow-Mask-Knight-Hoodies-Plus-Size-Drawstring-Sweatshirts-p-1417624.html?akmClientCountry=AU&currency=USD&utm_source=facebook_cpc_fashion&utm_medium=cpc_fashion1&utm_content=ThomasAP&utm_campaign=rm-app-male5-dpa-cs-most-hot14&utm_ho&utm_design&fbclid=IwAR3zEIpcL0ESV-t8yxfdvczhGI49BScVivjus9Hh59RAI3SbSfc1HlDhMLo&ID=2363146&cur_warehouse=CN) Who needs kevlar when you you can just scare the ground away with an evil gaze through  your helmet.... hood... whatever it is.

Anyone up for some Esk8 jousting :rofl:

I'm ashamed that I didn't find this earlier and profit from it before LR came and saturated the market.
