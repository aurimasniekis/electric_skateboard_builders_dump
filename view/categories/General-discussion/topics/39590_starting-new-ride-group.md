Hey y'all! Starting a new ride group for people in San Diego, CA. Facebook group below.
https://www.facebook.com/groups/1733865319966737/

This ride group is a separate operation from my company, so all esk8s are welcome! Goal is to do a group ride on a biweekly basis. If you're a local, I'd be interested to hear about your favorite routes in Downtown San Diego.

Is there a category or main thread? I don't see one.

I live in San Diego, however, half of the year, I am in Riverside for college.  Will probably have to wait to go on rides during the summer but I'm definitely interested!

Sidenote I don't even have a facebook account but this might be a good excuse to finally make one.

no there was a bit of controversy because there was a dedicated events category that got shut down and redirected to .club board. 

now the mods may or may not shutdown any events related stuff on here. 

read that post, itll explain it.

The argument made sense but at the same time it was kinda stupid, sure this forum is dedicated to builders but it wouldn't hurt to have an events category

And nobody ever uses .club lol

There should be subsections like most other forums, then its all in one place and seen by all. i dislike this format. I didnt know .club existed until now!

For those who are interested in the ride group and have Facebook accounts... please do sign up for the event I created on the group page. I need to know who's available in order to proceed with executing the event.

I vote for an earlier ride on a weekend at a location with no cars such as the mission beach boardwalk.   If this happens you might see me and @Namasaki there.   Thanks for organizing a ride!

Aight noted. Is 1 o'clock ideal for everyone? Or perhaps I should start the ride earlier so we can plan some food stops for the ride.

I have Friday and Saturday off each week. Anyone who wants to ride in San Diego on those days I would love to join! I typically ride around ocean beach, but there's always cars, so it's a little sketchy at times , but Great Hills

The Banshee in its current configuration can do 24mph. However I need to send that specific Banshee out to reviewers, so I'll be bringing a Banshee with the same motors, but a smaller batery pack and different ESC :frowning:

If I am in town I will join for sure!  I have tentative plans for 12/9 so I am not sure about that date but future rides on Saturday sound great.  Thanks for being accommodating!  
P.S. My carvon v2.0 prefers flatter terrain.

Sweet a Carvon drive! Hopefully the group ride turns out well for everybody's eskates. Yeah I'm hoping we can host a ride group every 2 weeks or so. All the other group rides around here are few and far in between.
