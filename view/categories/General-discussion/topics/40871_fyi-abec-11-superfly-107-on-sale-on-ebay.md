it does and it doesn't. 

if you're rolling on shitty clones or even mbs AT wheels, it's a massive step up. 

problem is how quickly we get accustomed to upgrades.

Also the Electric Flywheels have an even bigger shortage.  And they are even older in the market than these.

I guess. I just assumed the term vaporware referred to a product that may or may not exist. IE: the company is selling them and the customer has no idea if the product is even real. But in this case we know it is an actual product just a shortage. But I do see your point.
