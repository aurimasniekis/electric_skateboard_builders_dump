I just purchased some abec 11 90mm 75a genuine flywheels on Amazon, i believe the seller has another 17 sets in stock at about $ 88 a set.  Below are links.  MuirSkate.com also has 83mm 75a genuines in stock as well as 90mm 75a's if anyone is interested.

I figured the muirskate stock would go fast as they can't seem to keep these wheels on the shelf.  Luckily there are still over 10 sets on Amazon available at roughly the same price.  Whoever is interested should take the plunge sooner rather than later as these wheels always sell out quick as I'm sure you already know.
