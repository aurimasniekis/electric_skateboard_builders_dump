Hey guys, im trying to make this my new wheel of choice instead of clone abec 11 wheels, BUT DIY seems to be the only one to sell a drive pulley and its 40 bucks a piece, and i have dual drive.  

Any one have any cheaper options? 

Thanks

[VEX robotics][1] sell a cheap 42T plastic HTD5 pulley you might be able to modify to fit your wheels.
Some people in the e-board community have ordered them but I haven't seen any results.

I use them on my pneumatic wheels. They are solid. I like them every bit as much as metal and they are adjustable between 9 and 15mm belts.

thanks for the options guys, ill prob go with @torqueboards after a little more research.  I usually would buy pulleys from https://sdp-si.com/eStore/Catalog and drill them but im so bad at getting them perfectly center :(

If you have access to a 3d printer, there are plenty of pulleys for Kegels on thingiverse. Although, they don't last as long.
