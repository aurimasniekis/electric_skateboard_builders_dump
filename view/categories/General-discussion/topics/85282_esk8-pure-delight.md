As a direct opposite to the other thread, I want to know what things you've discovered give you pure delight.  The opposite of a pet peeve.  This should be only things discovered by and related to esk8 building and repairing.

What makes you happy?  Things that are just awesome?

Yes, this

Letting your dog outside downtown off-leash and letting her go *anywhere she wants to, however fast she wants to*.  (She's trained to wait for my signal to cross roads) When she's tired, she will ask to be picked up and we will esk8 back home.  Adds a whole new meaning to walking the dog.  More like walking the human.

Well, which languages do you drop your deuces in? I'll try to avoid those.

For me, sharing the knowledge I've picked up through this journey. A guy got in touch with me and couple of months ago after seeing my build on our local Facebook page. Long story short, he now has proper trampa mtb (second hand) and I'm helping him upgrade it.

@b264 YESSSS!!!!!
This thread is so badly needed right now. Let’s just say for me lately, this forum has seemed a bit less than euphoric.

This is just off the top:

My sons face light up when I get home from work. 
A fresh grip job on a brand new deck. 
Waking up in the mountains to 2’ of fresh champagne powder and knowing the mountain is gonna be dead because it’s a Wednesday. 
Having a cop let you off with a warning when you know you’re super guilty. 
The final part arriving to complete your build after months of waiting. 
Getting paid to take a shit at work.

@Lunasi
@skatardude10
@J0ker3366

It will be pure delight when I’m able to keep up with you guys on group rides! 

I upgraded to a dual drive metroboard, and have a @psychotiller coming eventually!!


Honestly esk8 probably saved my life.  I’m about 16 months post accidental amputation of my right arm. Above the elbow. Industrial washing machine.
I lost guitar, video games, balisong flipping... everything that I felt made me, me. 

I some how came across esk8 and got totally sucked in to the idea. Ended up buying a 55 mile metro. Had a few snags, like a fall that broke both sides of my jaw and almost all my molars, but I continued to ride. Eventually I found some beautiful trails and was putting 30 mile rides on it almost every night. 

Eventually I found @Lunasi and her group of ragtag renegade rippers. We’ve had a beautiful winter in Denver until a few weeks ago, so we got to ride a lot. I cannot wait for dry streets. 

Esk8 is a distraction from the hell I see in front of me everyday. It’s the one thing in my future I’m excited about, the one thing I’m not afraid of.

The smell of boiling lye in the morning. Jk, it actually smells like **death** . However, this forum is my only artistic outlet (of interest) and I would say that my ultimate sploosh moment is finding a topic so interesting that I risk getting into trouble at work (which I **HATE FOR INTERFERING WITH MY READINGS**). Also, successfully repairing a motor. Don't know why,  but that's my absolute #1. A nice, quiet motor. 

Edit: also HCH bearings apparantly

Amputees unite!


The most delightful things about esk8 to me are;

The completion of your first build after a long night of building and troubleshooting when it finally works.


smooth dry streets.

all the cool people you meet at stop lights.

Going 30mph+ on a wood and metal contraption that you made yourself.

The first few miles of peak acceleration on a  full battery.

going from single 6364 on 90's to dual sk8 6374's on 107s 😍

connecting everything, getting no flames, and then clicking "start motor detection" and the motor actually spins. oh boy it's great
