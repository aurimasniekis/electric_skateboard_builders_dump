We're lucky in the UK, it is easy to chuck the protection on just to keep warm.
The rider is in somewhere with lovely weather, it must be difficult until you get a reminder..
I had a very good tumble today, owing to not setting up brand new trucks and complacency. I know I would have lost a lot of skin, and if I didn't have helmet on I might not have got up.
Need impact shorts though. My thigh/arse is in trouble..

RevZilla sells armored motorcycle shirts and jeans that look like heavy designer jeans and a heavy flannel lumberjack type shirt. They're armored with kevlar. I took a spill on thoe clothes at 40mph and smashed my TSG helmet but the clothes... not a scratch.. fucking superman shit or something. I walked away easily. Standing still they can get kind of hot. Moving, they're like a soft breeze on your skin because they breath. 

I'm in Florida, and when i ride more than derp speed down my own street i'm in full gear all year round.

That right there, is how you ride if you wana get skinned. I've done it too many times. I;m a street skate, and we hate anything protective, goes against the culture. But at some point, you realize you doing things far more dangerous on these eboards than I am on a regular board, even though I jump down and grind some pretty hefty shit.

Would like to see more speed though. Looked like around 35 mph at best in the video :)

Haha I jacked mine up too... Been about 2 months of stretching and jerkin off daily(I kid). But pretty much good now. But yea. I caught all my weight with my right hand, which collapsed and took a shunt to the elbow...

Elbow was fine because pads. But all the shock went into my rotator cuff. Best thing for these injuries is long static stretching..followed by some ballistics

Learned my lesson though haha never skate when damp(so humid the pavement is seeping...not wet just literally humidity) and carve as hard as you can... The board will 180 underneath you haha

i found that leaning over sideways and dangling my arm while gripping a heavy-ish object (i used one of my 6 ton jacks i use in my press) and fully relaxing the muscles in my arm so that things popped and stretched and rolled into place helped a lot. I would also get jake to tug my arm out every time i did somethign that hurt, and it worked. One of the things my ostepath did was use a massive vibrating massager in the palm of my hand while tugging on my arm to loosen things up. I tried dangling my arm while gripping an oribtal sander and it had a similar effect. 

and yes, stretches, stretches, stretches.

Ya'll should let him ride his ride, I've been down at 40 without pro beyond gloves (on a motorcycle) and walked away fine. Different risk assessements/value systems and all that. Not saying kevlar doesn't make it hurt less, but that takes some of the joy out of the risk for some of us

No harm in pointing out the danger though. The guy in the video has presumably made informed choices regarding protective gear and those choices should be respected, but if nobody mentions how dangerous a lock up would be at those speeds without gear then others might see this and underestimate the risks

It can result in a lot more than just pain though. I know of cases where people have died in impacts around this speed range (not esk8) while wearing gear. Not only that but if you hit a pedestrian at 40 you will almost certainly cause a serious injury. Somebody new to the sport might not realise how easily a board can lock up or have a brake failure‚Äã. For example, somebody coming to esk8 from downhill longboarding would be familiar with these speeds but not necessarily aware of the added risk factors that come with an electric board.

I enjoyed the video, but I don't think it's unreasonable to point out that it is pretty dangerous.

Same problem, but caused by a different accident. Try just one Yoga class, Ashtanga style if you can. Then decide if you like it or not, but in any case its healing power is immense. Tested on myself, starting from totally unbelieving, it has brought immense benefits to me.

@PXSS @L3chef

I saw 3 stop signs in the video(correct me if i'm wrong). I saw him slow down pretty significantly, and check his surroundings before accelerating through. 

All 3 times there were no cars to the left and the right(aside from the car in front of him).   You've never rolled through a stop sign not 1 time on your e-board? 

This past summer I was riding 30+ miles a day, and got to know the roads around my house like the back of my hand. I knew every stop sign and light. 

Certain stop signs I could see cars coming(from opposite directions) from hundreds of yards away. I am not going to come to a complete stop when i'm the only one around in some baron intersection(I understand that wasn't exactly the case here, but you get my point).

No. I have never rolled through a stop sign with an e-board, a skateboard, a bicycle, or a motorcycle. I have rolled through stop signs in my car in parking lots that have signs in silly places but that‚Äôs about it. I have seen a bicycle get slammed rolling through a stop sign when a car turned into them.

I‚Äôve driven the same roads to work for the past 4 years. I can tell you at what time exactly the light at the exit I take will turn green and for how long, how many minutes, I will have to wait for the next green light. I can also tell you what times the lights are in sync going in which direction. Regardless I got into an accident 2 weeks ago because of an idiot that was driving 70 on a 35 and weaving through traffic. They rear-ended me as I stopped to a yellow turning red light. 

People that drive or ride like idiots because they feel entitled to go as fast as they can without regards for others should get their driving license taken away in my opinion. If you cannot follow the law, then ride a bus or taxi or whatever. 

That is my opinion

The way you ride just does not look very experienced. The way you push start is just plain wrong. It doesn¬¥t make me confident in your ability to fall in a way to avoid harmful injury. Just look at some videos from experienced longboarders and their posture on high speed rides! 
Please do not upload this kind of videos to youtube it will just lead to trouble for you and the whole community.
Btw. your build is awesome, don¬¥t take it too personal and take it easy on the throttle until you learn to ride and fall properly.

@Mattmccrary8 heres how it works. If you dont fall, you know how not to fall.

 If you do fall, you know how to fall



I fall like three times every ride, lol. I ride too aggresively. Yesterday i fell a few times, lost my phone from the fall, and almost was run over twice. Now it hurts to even take a step. I fell with the standard tuck and roll/slide but still injured. Its inevitable. I was just wearing a helmet, and i was dizzy because i landed on my head.

the part that you don‚Äôt seem to understand, is that it only takes one fall and it could all be over.  you may not have fallen yet, but it‚Äôs not the type of thing that happens a few times then you slowly start to put on some gear.  it will happen all at once and you will end up in the ER.

I cherish my physical condition and well being. I like to do physical exercise and workout as much as i can. I think daily on ways to maintain my physical condition and minimize injury (be it through nutrition, rest, warm up exercise, etc.). 

@Mattmccrary8  Seeing you go that fast without proper safety equipment unsettles me. I took a fall on my mountain bike a few years back and micro fissured my radius near my elbow. First couple of days i couldn't bend my arms towards my mouth (so eating, brushing teeth, etc became hard). Afterwards,  I couldn't fully extend my elbow for more than a year. Imagine doing bench press without fully extending one of your arms. Kinda sucks! 

My physical and mental well being are above everything else to me. My body is a temple and I'll be doing my best to keep it running in top condition.

That's a hypothesis, and frankly not a very credible one. But telling him he CAN'T is just doing the same thing to him that you worry will hypothetically will happen to us. 

These are important issues and need to be well thought out.

My point is that it will not only affect him, it will affect the whole community. That is something @onepunchboard may not have thought of when he said "YOLO dude". Besides the fact that throwing clapping hands up for someone potentially injuring/killing themselves seems in bad taste to me

First of all, I was being cynical about him doing it. sorry for my bad Humor

Two, it won't be regulated because some idiot dies riding unregistered vehicle.unless california of course. it already breaks the law by riding skateboard on road.

Three, in USA alone about 30 people dies from longboarding every year, adding 1 more doesn't change.

Let him ride how he wants, I don't wear helmets either tho I don't go above 25mph normally.
Maybe he has some death wishes,

Problem I see is people not keeping traffic law, this can cause other people harm.

This would be a survival of the fittest situation. We all push him to wear a helmet and he taunts us by showing another video of him not wearing one (total troll. Stop feeding). If he falls and has a head injury, it‚Äôs his choosing as an adult. If he survives then he‚Äôs ‚Äúfit‚Äù.

Plenty of States allow riding motorcycles with no helmets.  I think we all understand even with full racing leathers this sport and others like it have risk associated with it.  Every piece of protective equipment you remove you assume more risk.  No one says if I go ride without a helmet pants and gloves I'll be safer... If this was a 13 yr old posting this video then maybe some internet counseling would make sense. But since this grown ass man posted the video we're all just stating obvious facts and opinions...a lot.

i have decided to start riding totally naked and in reverse with my knees locked at all times and my arms raised over my head waving the bible and screaming about hell.

you know what's interesting.. is i picked the perfect industry to not have to worry about bad PR. 

For example, if i did this, then led the police on a 3 hour slow chase down a bike trail while offending every single person i passed in some way, made the news, got labelled a nut case, was ordered by a judge to seek help and became a meme... I'd sell the shit out of some boards. Nobody would give a shit they'd just laugh and ask me if i've tried those other wheels yet.

I've had three of those happen too. But the shark was tiny and caught while fishing. The snake was just a black snake I stepped on. Lightning through metal framed window into my computer monitor and into my elbow. 

I don't mess with monkeys though

-Nice Build!  40/mph.. holly schnikies!
-Great riding surface conditions too!

...But you will never have a chance at testing your theory of out riding most of us without protective gear.  

you built a nice board, now lets see you build up your protection, it can be just as fun as building the board.

Good Luck man

Just took the AMC this morning and guess what I almost bumped into right when I open the door? A punk on an esk8 riding through the f**kin school hall way. What made it worse was that that hall was only 8 feet wide and he almost got doorboned and bump into people coming out of the next room. It looked like a diy board since there was an unmounted disk on the back truck, but the deck looked like that of an Inboard and it sounded like he was using hubs. Granted he was only going 5 mph no one really thought it was electric, but man that caught me off guard.

im just imagining how sick it would be if my school allowed skateboards. My school is an ‚Äúoutdoor‚Äù school without hallways, and plenty of space to skate.
