Hey.  Probably going to get me slung out of here but really hope it doesn't.
Jason love your work, seriously love it.
Sycophancy out of the way, to business;
i had two focboxes and an enertion remote/receiver in my cart on your site last night and you quoted me $70 delivery.   $70 !!!   that parcel weighs less than my last crap, would have taken up no more room than a G&G burrito, was worth Over $500 and i'm in the same bloody state.   seriously? 
I get it manufacturing takes place in china and that's pricey but i'm not buying from china i'm buying Australian, local Australian. and proud to do so.  keep up the good work but sort out your shipping costs.
pretty please.

Creating a thread for calling out single vendors for shit they pulled is called vendor bashing here and is not allowed. I think because it creates a negative atmosphere and people go on for ages about single incidents that they should rather take up with customer care. I do not necessarily agree. Except when it gets really personal.
What is allowed though is creating a build thread and sharing your experience with different vendors there.

For scams and such there is this thread:

Nope. Not yet. Pretty sure I don't want a *normal* teen then.
