they want 120$ shipping to israel :( 
what the hell? should cost max 60$! nobody else sells that deck...
maybe ill get this instead: https://www.daddiesboardshop.com/madrid-market-place-bamboo-longboard-deck-2016
same shape more or less, and i think will fit better to the battery pack. but that honey deck is still amazing. dont know if worth the extra cash. waiting for a mail from them about the shipping price. but as i think about it more, the madrid deck is very decent one also.

Honestly, I'd go with a smaller enclosure or a different deck because you'll likely have the corners of the enclosure hanging over the cutouts. I have a similar sized enclosure and had a tough time finding a board that fit.

Finished product. Just barely fit and this deck was 9.75 wide all the way to the cutouts...the honey deck narrows before the cutouts.

thanks for the info mate. its exactly 26" on 8"? if you will take a ruler it will help me alot.
already ordered the enclosure, but i think the madrid one will fit slightly better. https://www.daddiesboardshop.com/madrid-market-place-bamboo-longboard-deck-2016  - photo for reference.
more or less the same, but the neck look alittle wider at the "deck" part. also i dont care about trimming the edges.
your setup works well? in the last photo it looks good!
also you are happy with the drop-through? im thinking top-mount for this...

Make sure the board is stiff enough that it doesn't bend under your weight.

My enclosure is exactly 26.5 x 7.5 
Not really a fan of the drop through...I actually made this board for my wife. I prefer top mount kick tail boards.

thanks, so I belive it will fit the madrid.
how can i make sure the board is stiff enough? i want alittle bit of flex in my ride, and im sure its not more flexy than the evolve bamboo gt which also have a lithium battery underneath...

Evolve's batteries are designed to flex...yours probably will not be. A little flex is ok (meaning barely noticeable) much more and you're asking for trouble.

I'm a bit worries about saying this, don't wanna get blamed if someone melts there enclosure.  But...

I usually out a piece of cardboard or a towel on my deck the clamp the enclosure down where I want to mount it and hit the ends with the heat gun.  This makes the enclosure slightly reform it's curve to fit a board perfectly.

WARNING!!!  There is a very fine line between getting the plastic soft enough to shape and ending up with a puddle if plastic goo, so do this at your own risk.

I deformed one a little bit by keeping the heat on it too long, but I was able to go back and fix it after it cooled.

That deck should be good to go for size and stiffness.

Is that 26.5 exterior or interior? I'm thinking of getting this board if its long enough

That board has since been stolen, but I’m 99% sure those were the exterior dimensions. 

Remember to leave enough room for the motor...I went with the reverse mount on this board because I didn’t leave enough room for a forward (normal) mount.

That sucks dude I’m sorry to hear that...on the bright side, chances are, whoever stole the board probably has absolutely no idea how to maintain it. 

And yeah, I’m thinking reverse mount as well
