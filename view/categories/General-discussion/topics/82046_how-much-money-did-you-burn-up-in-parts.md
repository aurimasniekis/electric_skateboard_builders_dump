# How much money did you burn up in parts?

```

I already broke 60 euro bms, 25 euro anti spark, and now 90 euro Focbox
And my board is not even finished yet (well because my focbox died on me)

Bought a faulty motor of 45 euros so I guess that kind of counts too.

I kinda regret full diy, maybe I should have like got a backfire and went from there or used less quality parts because Iâ€™m kind of bummed out about the money I burned up :neutral_face:

It is a lot of fun and I learn much but itâ€™s so costly and it frustrates me all the time that something does not work out.

Curious what you guys went through...

There's enough information on this forum to make it clear that there's a very good chance DIY will not be cheaper. But you'll end up with new knowledge and a good board :)

Can't say exactly how much Ive spent but it's def in the hundreds of US dollars. It can be expensive when you go crazy but still nothing compared to my other hobby, cars.
Diy is worth it cause those prebuilt boards break too but their parts are much more expensive and sometimes depending on the manufacturer they won't sell you certain parts. 

With diy you can always fix it.

Started with a $200 BOM spent over $700 before I scraped everything and started fresh.

I knew diy would be more expensive
I did not go diy route to cheap out. I thought it was fun but my fun factor is kind of challenged by all the frustration and money lost

DIY is cheap for a mid quality board...a reasonable dual hub board can be done for $300...but nice boards are definitely more expensive up front when making them from parts

Nothing, I must be fairly lucky + chose quality parts. Unless you count broken light brackets which I had to replace for about $20 total.

for my first build i got so f'ing confused by the vesc. I kept plugging the remote reciever into the wrong place, and i cut up my whole vesc heat shrink. then i couldn't get dual to work cause no good tutorials and i threw a book across the room cause i spent like three days doing master and slave! the book broke my closet door. my parents were pissed and yeah.

I have a box of broken vescs

Broken 2 decks

I think I'm only up to some dislocated bearings and a dead ESC...but still haven't finished a board so the ratio of boards to broken parts is kinda bad

- 1 x 4.12 VESC (fried beyond repair)
- 2 x VESC-X (Repaired by the wizard)
- $500 battery was a dud form you know who, (recouped $300)
- cracked the old spacecell enclosure over tightening at an angle too


Since your mentioned Backfire. I just got a new replacement of the Ranger X1 from them. Customer service was pretty awesome. I wasn't getting advertised speed or range, not that I expected to, but it was way too low compared to other around the same weight. After a few videos proving my issues, they sent me a new board, took three days, even let me keep the extra charger (probably cost them $2).

I've broken:
A motor pulley $15
A tacon 160 $65 (burnt windings)
3s 5000mAh (really puffy so I got rid of it cuz I didn't want a fire) $35
A Bluetooth module $15
A voltmeter $20 
A vesc $100 (but I got it repaired for $45)
So $150 + $45 to repair the broken vesc
```

My broken parts list:

* VESC 4.x DRV fault (shorted something probing around while things were powered) $90
* Long board deck (crashed into wall, DIY remote issues... bug has been patched) about $50 loss
* Couple of belts, just under tensioned stripped teeth from belt when braking hard probably $20
* Turnigy Multistar Batteries, over-discharged cell, had to ditch whole pack, decided to go down from 12S to 10S, still using LiPo packs though, loss was about $90
* Burned up some NRF24 chips making my own remote (learning they don't like 5V for very long) $10
* Probably lost a year or so off my life when I vaporized a 18 gauge wire by shorting it on a high discharge battery while plugging into charger... don't use those split cables for charging things can go bad

Total: $260 in parts sent to esk8 heaven

---

Edit I think I blew another VESC but I gave it to someone to get fixed and forget how it died but guess that's another $90 if you're really looking at sunk costs.

Battery overcharged during charging. 

Luckily I got the board onto the pool deck before it burst into flames. Didnt have to pay any damages, only an hour of work for clean up.

That's crazy!  I assume that the battery caught fire.  I hope the hotel didn't charge you for the damage.

Nope. The crazy thing is that, it was a 15ah pack that I was charging with a 2a charger. I had been charging it all day and decided at the last minute I wasnâ€™t going to go to dinner with my parents. 5 minutes after they left it sparted hissing and puffed about an inch. 3 minutes later there were flames shooting 3 feet in every direction.

I honestly dread to add up how much I've spent. I always buy this random little crap like screws and wires that I may or may not need. I'd say that its at least $2000AUD with almost a quarter of that being shipping. I also don't even wanna think of all the beer I've gone through on those long nights trying to fix the dumbest shit

I've been messing around for a year. I'm running my same two focboxes. Same battery. Same wheel pulleys. Same mounts. Same enclosure. Antispark died, just replaced with a loop key. 

I haven't burnt through anything really, motors are holding up great. Bearings holding up great. Belts tend to last forever. 

I did replace my grip tape recently.

I've really only added, never really had to replace so far, outside the occasional consumable like that one pulley.

Am I in the minority here? It seems like it... If something broke, I'd break my ass trying to figure out a cheap way to fix it before trashing it, I don't think I can justify dumping endless amounts of $$ into this if things were to break that easy. Thankfully I haven't had to beyond the initial investment.

I mostly just messed up my motor on my first DIY but wasn't too costly to replace. Vesc's generally fare pretty well for me too, battery issues are my constant demon.

I think I've burned through about $300 worth of parts. Hummie V2 hubs that spun on the axles when the Loctite holding them on broke loose and ripped the phase wires out catastrophically (my fault), fried an SK3 on a mountain board, killed a couple Lipos accidentally leaving a board on for a few days, and fried a Turnigy watt meter...somehow. Not too bad considering I'm **3000-4000%** over my initial first build budget I started  with 3 years ago. :exploding_head: :money_mouth_face: :face_vomiting:
