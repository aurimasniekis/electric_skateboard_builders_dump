Hey guys

For the ones looking for aluminum pulleys, I designed 15mm wide 36 teeth HTD5m pulleys. To get a good price I will order 100 of them, so that's why I'm doing a pre-sale now for only 19 euro's :slight_smile: 

They will be anodized in black, if you want 10 or more pieces (for resale or whatever) you can contact me ;)
