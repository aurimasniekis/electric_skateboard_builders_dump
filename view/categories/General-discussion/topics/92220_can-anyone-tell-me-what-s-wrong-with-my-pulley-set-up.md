Can anyone tell me whatâ€™s wrong here?

(Video Removed - problem solved motors just needed to be switched sides)

Is the motor pulley to close to the mount? Are the wheels not lined up correctly? Not sure what itâ€™s hitting against to make this noise.

Sounds like a lose motor magnet or a broken sensor causing cogging.

Hmmm, I bought them brand new from @JLabs and I just plugged them in for the first time. Maybe itâ€™s something else?

Took it completely off the mounts and held it in my hand and itâ€™s still doing the same thing

So its still either a broken hall sensor or a loose magnet. The only other thing i can think of is your settings might not be identical to each other. Can you post pictures of your motor settings?

Also make sure ti check that all connections are making full contact and nothing is loose. But i really think its a bad hall sensor.

Yeah, I just used the unity recommended settings I believe.

I see. Open up the motor and check the hall sensors along with the solder job on the pcb holding the sensors. Here's a pic of what it shouldnt look like.

Don't open that motor until you check your warranty.  I would just contact @JLabs and get some feedback.

Yeah, I havenâ€™t touched either of them and donâ€™t plan on opening them.

Have you tried it with the hall sensors unplugged? Is it in foc or bldc?

Yes, same thing with hall sensors unplugged although I think itâ€™s slightly less severe jerking.

It really sounds mechanical.  Magnet or bearing.  Most likely a loose magnet.  You can check the phase wiring easily without opening it up to see if there is a short in there.
Three wires from the motor are A B and C
Disconnect the motor from the ESC 

Touch A+B together. Verify the motor has choppy brakes
Touch A+C together. Verify the motor has choppy brakes
Touch B+C together. Verify the motor has choppy brakes
Touch A+B+C together. Verify the motor has SMOOTH brakes that are much stronger

All the choppy brakes should feel the same. If one is weaker or stronger or if anything isnâ€™t as described above, it means you might have winding issues.

Did you try swapping the motor to the other phase leads and see if the same problem occurs? 

Iâ€™m not exactly sure what the issue is because it sounds like a loose magnet in the first video, and half a shorter phase wire in the second. Swapping the motors will rule this out. 

No matter the issue, Iâ€™ll take care of it in the end.

Have you set up your unity!?   It sounds to me like you need to run motor detection and hit apply button

Have in mind.   App doesnâ€™t work all that great most of the time.  Well.  At least not for me.    Sometimes after I press apply updated settings they wonâ€™t save and I have to disconnect, reconnect and run motor detection again before I can get it to work ðŸ™‚

Swapping the motors worked, thank you!

Also! Do you have any 10s 3A chargers for sale? Last I checked it said you were out of stock. Do you know where I could buy one? :)
