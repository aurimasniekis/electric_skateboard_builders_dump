Today reminded me of why I'm glad to have done a 4wd build, instead of sticking to 2wd. I have stated before, that my goal in electric skateboarding to create a serious mode of transportation rather than something to play around with. To do that, we need to create redundant systems, so when (not if) something fails, fail safes are in place.

Today while riding home from class, I experienced a failure in 1 of my 4 motors while traveling down a rather steep hill. I immediately noticed the reduced braking power, as it went to 3wd. However, 3 motors is still more than enough to stop me (200 lb plus my backpack with my laptop weighted 20 lb, so 220 lb total) without any incident. Had I been on 2wd, I can't say the results would have been the same, considering the steepness of the hill I was going down.

One of the major benefits of 4wd is you create redundancy. If one motor fails like it did in this case, you have 3 more to make up for it. I was able to ride the rest of the way home (about another mile or so) home without any issue with the only effect being I was limited to 20 mph instead of 24 mph (I noticed the board feeling more sluggish, so I pulled my phone out and started measuring my speed on flat straights of my route. I didn't know the motor was not working at the time). I found the motor not spinning when I got home.

The issue was not the motor broke, but 2 of the 3 cables between the vesc and motor broke. This was because where I soldered the 3 motor cables to the vesc, I stripped away too much wire. As a result, too much wire was exposed, and vibrations mixed with the concave of my board put too much tension forces on the wires and they broke. It was a simple fix and their is no permanent side effects. But having the extra motors added extra safety that allowed me to stop on a hill I could of had a run away into traffic and allowed me to keep riding with little side effects.

There is one flaw in my design, which is if the master vesc fails, I would be just as screwed as a 2wd board. That, I want to find a way to make more redundant (Ideas?). But the same can be said if one of the slave vescs fails. It's not a big deal, and doesn't impact safety to have a slave vesc fail.

No one can expect a failure, but they do occur, and we need to be ready for when (not if) this happens. Our boards won't last forever (nothing does), and cars and airplanes create redundancy and fail safe systems to attempt to avoid catastrophe.

This incident today helped me refocus my energy into creating the safest electric skateboards possible. My vision is to create boards capable of safely commuting electric skateboarders at speeds of 45 mph+ without loosing torque due to hills. 4wd really helps get me closer to this goal. Hills slow me down from 24 mph to 20 mph at worst. With 1 or 2 motors, I would slow down to 12 mph or even less on hills, depending on the steepness. Today, I tackled my first 20% grade hill. I was able to travel 18 mph up that hill.

I don't want to build toys to play with (of course I still play with them), but a real option that can travel as fast as a car and get me from point a to point b in the same time or less than a car, as safely as physically possible. I'm getting closer to that goal thanks to 4wd, as I no longer slow down significantly on steep hills (which I am surrounded by living in San Francisco) and a single motor or vesc failure does not mean I lose control or the ability to keep trucking on.

(I don't want you guys to get the wrong impression, this thread is not about bragging. I want to share my experience of riding 4wd for the past week 10 miles a day for the past week (including my first hardware failure which could have resulted in an accident. And why I think 4wd, especially 4wd hub motors, are the future of electric skateboarding.)

I don't think we can today, we're not building them like high speed transportation devices.

If you want to do 45 mph of roads constantly, you need suspension, air filled tires that can go over large pot holes with no side effects, fail safe systems, and more. I think we are a long ways away from it. Many years, but I do think it's possible. And I will do everything in my power to keep innovating and working with other innovators until this becomes a reality. 

Moving on from the latest drama on this forum, I feel we as a community do need to stop tearing each other apart, and working together, sharing information, and caring less if we profit, but helping this community grow and creating safer boards. No one should be using hardware with know flaws to certain members of the community. We forget how dangerous what we do is. I'm finally setting aside funds to get a tsg full face helmet, and a full leather suit. We can't do anything if we are brain dead or literally dead.

I think those are a great idea and I've had my eyes on them for a while. I would like to have a servo control them instead of a peddle, and activate that servo via a button on the controller as an emergency brake (not a main braking system). But I think 4wd creates the first layer of safety for braking.

Ideally i would say you would want both, convenience of being electrically controlled for normal operation and a mechanical pedal if electronics fail. I'm in the process of modelling some precision trucks with inboard disk brakes.

That's true, cause drop outs are one of the biggest problems to safety I've seen in this community. If you have a controller drop out, the disc brakes do nothing if you can't control them with out the controller.

This 4wd performance is pretty impressive.

45 mph seems very realistic. 

A servo controlled Brake Board would be amazing. Would really open up high speed mountain touring. 

I suppose hubs could be mated to that axle profile?

Sweet, that's what I was going to use. Not sure if buying the kit is even worth it for these brakes.

Someone on endless sphere did it with two discs and it worked quite well. I estimated around 20mph to 0 in 25ft. Nothing spectacular but that's about as much as you can do without flying off.

The total cost of my 4wd was about $1800. It's really not that bad when you consider the price of a raptor or boosted dual+ or evolve gt (which is more expensive). Belt drives have more parts, and when you cut out a lot of inflation that's been in hubs so far, they are so much cheaper than belt drives. And they are simpler, if you power it smartly and configure it right, you can get just as much torque and speed from hubs as a satellite config.

[/quote]

It's true, but the point of this topic was more about improving safety. It will likely allow you to still brake if 1 motor fails. This is why single motor planes are super dangerous. And I feel that single motored boards have this weakness (say a belt brakes on your mono drive board down a hill, you could be screwed).

Many people on this forum ride in controlled and environments, or a few times a week or don't like riding over 15 or 20 mph, but there's a hand full of us that us it to commute, and want to reach speeds of a car on that commute. And odds are in that environment, something will go wrong with something at some point, whether tomorrow or in 5 years. The question is will you be ready when that happens?

I don't think a lot of people who like speed realize how risky it is riding over 25 mph without leather or a good helmet (like me). I'm glad to see some in the community like @RunPlayBack involved in telling stories of what can go wrong. They are a good reminder of what can go wrong. There's a reason the guys who test the nextgen board wear helmets and leather.

dude, you are taking this too far. A 45mph Eboard is not a commute tool but a suicide machine. Also 4wd is not saver imo b/c twice the motors and twice the electronics present twice the risk of a failure that could potentially throw you off the board at high speed... and then redundance doesnt do sh*t.

People that go that fast on a longboard need to be in full leathers, gloves and a full helmet.
Even 30 mph is just too sketchy for my tastes. I've gone 33mph on mine and it was not about enjoying the ride, it was about surviving the ride just to see how fast the board would go. I've pretty much come to my senses after a couple close calls. IMO, 15-20 mph is fast enough.
But I have to agree that in the land of hills, the 4WD is King!

Couldn't anyone argue the same thing about motor cycles that go 160 mph+? More electronics doesn't necessarily mean more failure, because your reducing loads and stresses on parts. I draw less amps per vesc, my motors draw less amps, which means they stay cooler and aren't put through the same stress, does more really mean more risk of failure? Or does it alleviate the abuses that many builders do to their electronics, thus reducing the chance of failure?

I agree it gives you more places to fuck up when your assembling, but If you are careful, and know what to do, you can avoid the assembling problems, and then you have more electronics to pick up the failure of 1 piece.

Here's another idea: What if controllers had 2 receivers that communicate via different protocols (2.4 ghz and bluetooth for example), that could determine when the signal in one is lost and seamlessly transferred over to the other?

It's more complicated, and you do introduce more places for something to happen, but if done correctly, it could eliminate drop outs.

Redundancy systems are complex by nature and can introduce new problems, but that doesn't mean you don't put them there. I can point to plane crashes were a redundant system caused the crash, but they have saved way more than they have caused. And feel they can do the same in electric skateboards.

You know, i'm reading this hyperbole about 4wd hub motors and redundant control systems and in spite of the fact that i'm an IT professional by trade I can't shake the most basic of human responses to the issues presented here............. LEARN TO SKATE!!!!

I don't care how many fail safes and redundancies you have designed in place, there is no technological replacement for skill on a skateboard.  There isn't an electronic failure on a 30% decline that a properly executed heal side slide won't get you out of safely, quickly, and without injury.  We're building devices that can propel a human to incredible speeds with relative ease, and sometimes it feels so easy that it convinces relative newbies to believe they're better on a board than they really are.  That FALSE sense of confidence is DANGEROUS.

DON'T SKATE BEYOND YOUR SKILL LEVEL!!!!!

Its true that it's up to the rider to understand how to skate. I've been riding on normal board for 10 years pretty much daily, never been a long boarder though. The only reason I didn't get seriously hurt the first time I feel at high speeds is because I know how to fall at high speeds. But leather would have been nice, I got torn up. A foot drag at 45 mph is a lot scarier then when going 20 mph. Not saying it can't e done (cause I saw that video on video of the guy foot braking at 40), but it's damn ballsy, and above most riders level.

I'm not at all sure on this, but is simply splitting the controller input out to all 4 ESCs an option? That way if any one blows, the other 3 will always work. Not sure on what negative side effects that would have compared to the master slave thing though, if nothing else you'd have to reconfigure all 4 whenever you make a change.

All valid points but I wouldn't be to game performing any kind of slide in traffic. The fact that you can now achieve speeds that only steep hills could provide on just about any road/bike path such, manoeuvres don't carry over

I dont get what you are saying here, a properly executed slide doesnt apply on a bike path or a road for what reason?  Cars?  Pedestrians?  If you ever find yourself hurtling out of control at high speed down a path with pedestrians and cars present and you dont know how to stop yourself you have not only endangered yourself but others as well and shouldnt have been skating at that speed in those conditions to begin with.

Agreed 100%. A slide isn't always the best solution, but a simple foot brake is something every esk8er should be able to execute without a second thought if they lose brakes. 

My biggest fear is my brakes engaging unexpectedly followed by uncontrolled acceleration. 

If you lose your brakes, your biggest worry should be the extra wear on your shoes.

IMO 
The +30mph way of thinking only achievement will be to speed up the process of regulation by the DOT in regards to eBoards. 

Every time we use our boards the community we live in is watching some people think is cool other think this is super dangerous.  
In SF as in NYC the urban speed limit is 25 MPH !!! So why try to hit 35 mph or car speed and be breaking the law all the time. 
if you need to commute then leave 5 min earlier.  

All is need it is a high speed accident and a politician trying to make a name for himself.  For us to have to register this vehicles with the dmv. And then all of us will be f**k, including vendors.  

So guys come on, let's be safe if you need the power of a 4x4 that's OK, but at least limit the speed in the VESC.

We just need to look all the regulation the UAV (Drone ) community is dealing with. Just because of the irresponsible behavior of a small number of its members.  Satisfy your need for speed in a private track just don't do it in public roads.

It's pretty telling that the people here who have had an incident think that 20mph is a perfectly good top speed (I'm in that group) and those who, I'm guessing, haven't want to go 45mph :-)

No skateboard will be safe at 45 mph.  Full motorcycle racing leathers and a motorcycle helmet is the only way I'd attempt it.  Actually I wouldn't attempt it at all.

If I'm not mistaken in large trucks the brakes fail on rather than fail off.  So if you lose pneumatic pressure in the braking system a spring will lock the brakes up. and the air pressure actually keeps the brakes unlocked.

You could do something similar with a very small circuit that attaches to each motor - when it fails to receive a "live" signal it PWMs the leads together so drag is slowly introduced bringing the board to a safe stop.  This could be a module physically attached to the motor to avoid the broken lead issue.

going 30 plus mph is important to me.  I had motors before that did it but now only do 28mph.   I have a couple straight smooth well lot runs I like to go as fast as possible on public roads.  Illegal ? Yes. Am I going to hurt anybody but myself? Probably not. A crime in which it's pretty unlikely it'd hurt anyone but myself.  Consensual crime as they call it. 
I fell off going 28 last month t wasn't that bad and I was shockingly good. Banged my head but wear a helmet. Luke on the other hand doesn't even wear a helmet. To each their own and some people like heroin.

That's correct, a slide isn't always going to be the ideal solution but without taking in to account the immediate surroundings the basic decision between a slide and a foot brake comes down to skill level and 1 simple factor....... speed.

A foot brake is the safer, simpler, and more effective maneuver when traveling at slower speed.  By that I mean 15mph or less.  Above about 20 MPH a foot brake becomes increasingly dangerous with a quickly narrowing tolerance for error and imbalance and the slide becomes the much more effective, safe, and less technically challenging maneuver.  

Lets take [THIS](https://images.bigcartel.com/product_images/183509773/DSC_6169web.JPG?auto=format&fit=max&h=1000&w=1000) image for example...... presumably of Chaka since I stole it from his website.  I hope you don't mind Chaka, its for safety man!  Aside from the epic gangster flannel, most people probably notice the full face helmet and little else.  What stands out to me though is that Chaka is a guy who is known for riding at high speeds, and in this photo he's in a high speed cornering stance and wearing slide gloves.  He's clearly a guy who understands and respects what's required to safely and responsibly operate a board at the types of speeds we're talking about.

Here is where you and the others trying to go +30 MPH are dead wrong. The way things works is some or several guys get hurt or kill in high speed accidents and the rest of us will be hurt as well with a bunch of regulations and that are unwelcome. Just because some of you want to go crazy on public roads. You know you can go to a private track or parking lot and go wild.

While I agree with you, this is just how the world works. 

It may not be a bad idea for insurance companies to start offering protection to riders and those around them, especially if they are going to be going high speeds in public areas...because whether we like it or not someone will ruin it for everyone else. People forget to think of the consequences of their actions, especially when it has become so easy to pay for limited liability for our actions, meaning an insurance company will foot the bill. 

Once upon a time I would have been the one rocketing down the roads and mountains, and it took a few serious injuries to dummy me up...luckily no one else was ever involved in my learning curve. Too many people with the 'you only live once' attitude, myself once included...these days it is more about self preservation. 

Life is far too much fun to end it plastered up against a car or tree, or worse yet taking the life of another and having to live with it.

What speeds are we talking about for starters.  Do you draw a line at 25 and say over that is u safe or shouldn't be legal?  Different states have different laws. Here in Californi I think it's 20 mph but still the gt and boosted advertise higher and are around going faster than the law states and no one says a peep.  There is no safe speed but the legality, I don't feel a need to go slower and be legal for the sake of the greater eskate community. I don't consider others when I break any Consensual crime as there's no victim but potential myself.  If someone were to see me and complain about the speeds being too much there is already a law in place to deal with me individually. That's like telling farrarri owners that they're ruining it for drivers in general.
But as far as residency being desirable. It's more expensive. I also don't know if I fee it's necessarily safer. In a way it obviously is as if one motor dies there's another but you could look at it as another possible disaster

Well, there's 3 problems here.  

Nobody cares how fast you go until you hit somebody.  If you paste a kid going 30 mph and broadcast media picks it up that will be it for this sport - we'll be regulated into oblivion.  Remember, these are motorized vehicles.  Motorized vehicles are not allowed on trails whatsoever.  I ride trails all the time but I slow *way* down any time I pass other people and I crawl past kids.  People see this and appreciate this and that's why there aren't cops waiting for me at the end of the trail.

Not everyone who gets an electric longboard is going to learn to slide brake.  Especially boards with pneumatic tires.  You can argue that they should, but they won't.

Your theory about Consensual crime is the same argument that motorcycle owners argue about helmet laws.  The problem is not that they kill themselves, the problem is when they don't kill themselves but spend the rest of their lives in care facilities at taxpayer expense.

Also, look at the average age of an electric longboarder - you guys are (correct me if I'm wrong) almost all college kids.  Hell of a bad time to get a severe brain injury.

Like it or not every one of us is an ambassador of our sport - the way people see us as individuals acting in public is the way they will see the sport as a whole.

I don't plan on plowing any kid on a road.  If kids appear in the middle of the road while I'm going by at 30 we will both get injured and it'll be his fault.  You need to stop random kids from walking across the road
I never slide brake and don't plan to learn. I'm either using my brakes or bailing into a slide

So youre doing 30mph downhill and your master VESC or remote fails.  Your plan is to simply bail in to a slide because you dont want to learn to slide brake?

Thats a textbook example of irresponsible and dangerous riding.  What happens to the 15lb skateboard now hurtling out of control at 30mph after you "bail?"  What happens to the pedestrian it hits or the property damage it does when it collides with the porsche 40 feet from where you bailed to save yourself?

This is a great thread.

Aren't we kinda beyond regulation in the DIY market? If they make a speed cap at 5mph, how does that affect us? Commercial boards will be shitty, but the Feds aren't going to kick down hobby king doors and seize "illegal"ESCs that power some boards. Not going to affect alibaba, eBay, enertion. Yeah, cops can try to get ya with a ticket, but Remember, skateboarding is not a crime, and don't be stupid or get caught. 

I commute with my board need it go fast enough to keep up with Hawaii tourist traffic (25-35mph), our sidewalks suuuuuuck. Any time I have almost got in trouble was from me hitting a car because I couldn't brake hard enough. I ended up on hood of a diplomat car in DC on a BB+ which would have been way worse if I was on my current boards brakes. 

I'm all for 4wd if it means faster starting and stoping.

I ended up smacking into the back of a car she was asleep inside I couldn't stop laughing. I have to increase the brakes. 
There's now a law in Germany, or some type of standard, whereby a board has to come to a stop if it's unweighted.  I can appreciate that. I don't think even boosted or evolve are doing that yet though and only smoothboard. Why are you assuming I'm unsafe.  
I don't like doing foot drags. Especially with a 20lbs board.  Don't worry about me hurting me and don't worry about me hurting anyone else. Why me? There are a lot of people I'm sure go faster.

@Kaly I have to agree with you. Every time I see a barely in control esk8er barreling through NYC streets on their boosted board (it's always a boosted for some reason lol), barely grazing pedestrians, I know my days of enjoying esk8 in NYC are numbered.  Being irresponsible and drawing attention to their dangerous behavior affects us all, not just the individual. I am all for personal freedom to do whatever floats your boat, right up until it encroaches on my own rights.

Lol, in an attempt to link back to the subject of this thread, my 4wd build is for torque not top speed, driven by need to power 107mm wheels to combat NYC streets safely without always needing to resort to AT.

100% agree. As of now we are pretty much unregulated. I'd like to keep it that way.

i think the best redundancy is being able to skate it out without any mechanical or electrical help. if I had to give lessons in how to ride an electric skateboard, id give them a normal longboard and make them push a few kilometers regular, then push a few kilometers mongo, finally footbrake from ever increasing speeds. with these 3 things, youll always get home halfway safe. :slight_smile:

Speaking of unregulated, just today on the west side riverside parkway a block north of Chelsea Piers in NYC they put up a huge flashing portable billboard saying. "No E-bikes, e-scooters, hoverboards allowed  call this number to report as safety violation".  If they had an extra foot of room on the sign I am sure they would have added esk8.

Here's my two cents:

30+ is not only dangerous to you, but depending on the environment it is dangerous to people around you. If you are commuting in an urban environment and run into somebody out of control at 30 mph that's the shit that can get esk8s banned. 

HOWEVER: I agree with @Hummie to an extent. If you want to build a rediculously fast board, go ahead. Just wear the proper safety gear and stay at or below 20 if you are in a populated area.

Also, there's one major factor in this other than speed: skill. I don't have the guts or the response time to turn or stay on my board at 25+ mph. 6'3 also really sucks for balance. If you are like me, just make a cruiser. It's a whole lot cheaper and safer.

If I am doing 30 mph, it's on a road with a speed limit of 30 mph... It's one thing doing 30 mph on a path, and a different riding in the roads. If a car hits me, it's not going to drastically effect anyone but me. I live, breath, eat, and live to skate. When resting my legs from long hard sessions, eskating fills that void. I can still have that board feel, and solve a commuting issue at the same time. I don't advise doing this if you don't have the skill, I have spent years in San Francisco bombing hills on a regular board, passing cars at speeds over 25 mph with super loose trucks day in and day out. It's not easy power sliding at those speeds, you have to be perfect in sensing what's going on. How good is the road condition, is it bumpy, what's the road made of, all of these factors determine how well your wheels will slide, which determines how much force you need to put behind your lean. It's hard, but it's a skill you must learn if you want to be safe. You can gain a better sense and board feel, the same with learning to skate tranny. Learning how to fall is just as important, as is proper gear.

This is why I think there should be two categories of eskating, one for cruising (boards under 20 mph) that don't require licensing or registering and ones for 20 mph and over that requires registration, licensing and training, like their is with mopeds. We can't have a free for all, there needs to be a respectable structure in place, but saying this **should** never happen is a crime to the eskating community, and those who desire to ride their hearts out.

Life is dangerous, get over it. If steps are taken to increase safety, why are we ok with dangerous activities, like driving cars, mopeds, motorcycles, or even bikes for that matter, but not eskating at speeds of 30 mph+?

Well, not sure I want to push a longboard a few km, but I googled mongo, so now I know what that means! It's interesting the parallels here with the quadcopter flying community. Similar issues of safety and regulation in a new fairly dangerous technology, though with esk8 you're more likely to damage yourself rather than other people or property.

I'd like to add I've come off going at high speed, and will still want to do high speeds. It came out of nowhere, however because the road I came off on isn't too condusive to slides and my board doesn't have a good enough tail to use I always brake going down the hill, however my vesc drved yesterday at the crest without my knowledge until I went to slow down and kept going, I thought it was a drop out at first,majority of my shit is broken and I'm pretty beat, but I'll still do it all again, but I'm definitely going another manufacturer
As for failsafes there's countless ways you can do this, an analogue spedometer with a sensor to detect when the VESC is running fine and then governing the speed if it isn't using breaks that are outside the vesc area

As for regulations and going too fast influencing it, how many regulations surround downhill boarding? Those guys go a lot faster than 45mph. To top this off where I live it's plain illegal to use an esk8 at all, won't stop me, to further add to this it's plain illegal to use a sk8board anywhere on a road posted 50km/h or higher, does that stop people? no. It's also illegal to leave your car unlocked and to use your horn, there's plenty of these laws that seem to be there to prevent utter stupidity and to pass the buck when something goes wrong

Florida has no regulations for the boards i'm building or any other boards, commercial or DIY as far as i know. They're all by default illegal to ride anywhere because there's nothing allowing them and they don't fit in a defined vehicle class just for them yet. They're lumped into the "other" category which is basically not allowed on streets or sidewalks or most of the bike trails. 

We ride them anyway and just try to be safe while doing it. And nobody seems to care.

Exactly my main point on the legality. I believe it's like this because of the time and energy it would take to write entire acts/regulations to control the use of boards. So it makes it easier to make them illegal so that an officer of the law can make the decision at their discretion.

see what I don't like is stubborn people who insist on maintaining a certain speed and wont stop for anyone. For me such behavior is reckless. Altho cars are a constant danger in my years as a cyclist I probably had more memorable conflicts with people on a bike or on roller skates than with those behind a wheel. B/c some of these semi-professionals are really obsessed with their sport and appearantly too hip to brake. I mean I like a fluent ride too and I do not brake for no reason, but if I see lets say a crowd in front of me, people who are not aware, a mother with kids etc, I reduce the speed. I think that is a human thing to do that you dont put other people at risk to push your hobby to the limit, b/c that seems rather egoistic.

Well cyclists are the worst at this sort of thing. They never stop for anything. It's insane, cause on certain bikes routes, like the one that goes from the Castro to Fulton St here in sf, bikes don't stop at any stop sign. I used to deliver food in this area, and you would just sit there for 5 minutes some times and just watch a steady never ending flow of bikes run the stop signs at every corner, they almost never stop, despite the fact the San Francisco has ordinances which say you are essentially a car, and must follow the same laws. Then they bitch and complain when cars him them cause they ran the stop. I was told by paramedics when I got hit on my bike by a car (that stopped in the middle of the road, sat in between the yellow divider for 15 seconds or so, and only decided to move when I was passing, turning straight into me) that a cyclist gets hit in San Francisco every 15 minutes on average. But we aren't talking about banning bikes, despite this clear reckless riding that at least 75% IMO of cyclists here in SF do.

The whole drone regulation push thing was sad, but it's very different story with eboards. They are not being used to spy on people, they are not be ridden into houses, or falling and hitting people laying on the beach. They are not disturbing wildlife any more than a car already does. There's very specific things that caused the drone crack down, that don't exist on eboards. And the ones I listed above are just a few.

I'm much more a cyclist than an eboarder and was on a bike literally 4 hours a day, mostly racing, until 2 years ago when I got a longterm injury. They've recently tried to change the law here in SF to allow the rolling stop by cyclists. The Idaho roll they call it.  Bikes are much easier to control and, most importantly, stop.

I also used to fly drones commercially for a very short time. I took photos for a real estate agency since they didn't want to do it as at the time it was illegal to use them for commercial purposes so I took the legal risk for them.  I had the drone disappear soon in my short career with some kind of radio interference.  Someone came by and saw me looking around and after I explained how it had disappeared he went and got his drone to find mine.  His disappeared at the same spot.  The trans and receiver are the sketchiest part of eboards to me.

@caustin they also put one up by 59th St going south with a phone number asking people to help report violators.
Sucks as this is the E-Boarders Autobahn. I have traveled this often powered and unpowered. Just respect others and you should be fine but avoid South Ferry area as they are usually park police down there. I have passed a few of them (respectfully at speeds close to traffic around me). Early morning and late night are best for top speed runs when no one else is around.

Sorry to bump an old thread but if you're still looking for redundancy in transmitter/receiver pairs, you may want to use a different frequency for each for additional safety. 

Bluetooth operates in the same band (2.4-2.48 GHz) as the 2.4 GHz RC transmitters you are referring to. This band is part of the ISM (Industrial, Scientific, and Medical) allocation and devices in it are lightly regulated, with some limits on transmitter power and radio frequency emission outside the band. This band is also used by 2.4GHz wifi networks, and microwave ovens (which are usually quite well shielded so they won't emit, but physically damaged ones may do so if the shielding is compromised). 

So the result is that the 2.4GHz band is pretty crowded especially in cities. I have noticed on my mini torqueboards remote, which looks to be the same as the "Winning" remote, that sometimes when I'm traveling up a crowded street in my city and not holding the remote away from my thigh, it will cut out, most likely due to all the WiFi and bluetooth noise there. More transmit power from something like a GT2B vs a mini remote will help your signal overcome the noise, but for maximum redundancy you might want to look at getting a 900MHz remote in addition to your 2.4 or bluetooth. That band is less crowded and you won't encounter nearly as much noise/interference when traveling in dense areas with lots of WiFi.

Good luck with your (already) awesome evolving build!

Cool thread. It seems to have wandered from 4wd safety and design though.

About our behavior. Like it or not, we are ambassadors for the sport. Respect pedestrians, and try to play by the rules. Show the community respect and maybe they'll let us be. 

Protection wise, things get really dangerous really fast over 20. I wear gloves with Knox slide pads (they do a lot to prevent arm injuries), hip and knee Armour under my jeans. Alsway a full face helmet, (I use Bell's lightweight Mt bike hrlmet) unless I'm going over 25 then I wear a full faced motorcycle helmet, I use D3o elbow pads at for 15-20, and full motorcycle class 2 body Armour for higher. If you ride, you're going to fall. I also try to manage my risks by generally staying under 20. 30+ is cool for short sprints, but if you ride balls to the wall all the time you will fall at those speeds guaranteed. Everybody falls. 

With 4wd, I let @psychotiller build my epic battery as he knows what's up. I had considering using a Can bus harness to connect my four Vesc 6. 6's, but @psychotiller said he'd had some bad experiences with that setup (read 4 fried Vescs). I'd been considering radio redundancy so my plan is to have one master and one slave on both front and back while using two descrete recievers each hooked up to its master. I thought 4wd traction control would be cool, but this way I'll still have it, only in two systems front and back.

But, as been mentioned you've got to stay within your ability levels, falls come at unexpected times at any speed. Don't be fooled, some of my low speed crashes have hurt a lot more than the high speed ones. Also definately learn to skateboard/longboard first. The ability to push and foot brake, fall properly, bail properly, read the road and more.

Yeah, 6 actually...The first 2 failed because we had the canbus connecting all four 100a vescs. Then as we plugged in the battery, the master switch failed, causing the system to power up before everything was plugged in. This fried a mosfet, killed a drv, and took out the mosfet tranciever on the #1 slave. Then I took 2 good ones out of my own AWD. Replaced the switch, hooked my two up with the 2 remaining in the new build. Powered up, fried all 4 canbus transceivers! 6 down!!! I messaged maytech, and they said canbus isn't a good idea with 4 of these 100a vescs. (They also said to send them back in for repair) :sunglasses:  Anyhow. FYI, Long canbus harnesses are no bueno.  No issues with PPM splitter.  -Just make damn sure you glue all ppm splitter connections. If anything on ppm rattles loose you will have instant regret.
