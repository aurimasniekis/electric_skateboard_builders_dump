Hey everyone.

I just made an order for a heat sink plate from 3D Servisas and naturally I'm already excited about receiving it!

Anyone know the usual ETD?

Just had an email to say mines on its way! Or atleast they've "sent" it at their end.

Also, if anyone here works for them/knows the site owner - you have a security token or store certificate that's out of date. The only way I could get onto the website was using phone data. Virginia media in the UK rejects the access to the HTTPS server.

Hey, it should arrive to UK within the week (5 work days) at least that's how fast I am getting myself stuff from Lithunania.

Regarding certificate double check your side, we use Shopify which is service so I don't think their SSL would expire...

If you mean timeframe in general, I placed an order for a gear drive a few weeks ago. Got the tracking number after a day or two if I recall.

Shipping took forever due to the postal service I believe. It apparently sat in the exchange office for a week which I donâ€™t understand why but its now on the way to me. Its international shipping for me btw
