Awesome..... 

sorry again to the very patient customers... this took longer than expected to arrive!... but as we grow we are learning how to do everything faster and better.... 

we look forward to servicing our loyal EU customers with much greater speed from now and also we will continue to work on new deals that are "import duties free"

Thanks again to my EU warehouse manger Nexty.

We have some big plans! So stay tuned.

Just a heads-up: a 2 year warranty is mandatory for all consumer goods sold in the EU.
The EU warehouse is real.
Will Enertion be complying with European law ?
