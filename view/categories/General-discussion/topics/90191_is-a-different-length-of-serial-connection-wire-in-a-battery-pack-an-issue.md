For reasons of space I need to do a serial connection for a 10s4p back like this:

I have basically two packs that I need to link. I want to use 10 AWG wire (two for each serial connection) and the length of one wire is 4 cm. The serial connection between the two packs is tough to make with two 4 cm wires, so my workaround would be to use a little bit longer wires. Would this be an issue or am I safe to do that?

Should be okay but if you want to be safe run 2 wires it will share the load.

Please keep simple questions in the noob questions thread. You will get more views there, and not be creating a full topic. But yes, its fine. Just make sure the wire has a high enough ampacity
