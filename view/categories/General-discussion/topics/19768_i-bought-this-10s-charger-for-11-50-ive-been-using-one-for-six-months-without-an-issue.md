It's a hover board charger actually.
 It comes with the three prong connector, which I removed and replaced with an xt60 connector and it works great. 
I have used it almost daily for six months charging 10s2p balanced battery packs,

Ha! I did the same thing! Without a BMS it likes to charge to 42.3v, for me. Haven't had any issues yet.

I do use this WITHOUT a BMS on a couple of my boards. The are Lithium Ion. I would not use Lipo's without a BMS.
