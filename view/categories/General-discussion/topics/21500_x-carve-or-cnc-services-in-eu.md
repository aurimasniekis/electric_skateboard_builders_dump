Hey guys,
I am looking for someone to mill some aluminium parts for a cheap 3d printer, so I can start printing some esk8 parts. Is there anyone with an x-carve or small CNC in the forum that could help a brother out. IÂ´m looking to spend  a max or 100 euros and have the files. Anybody in eu hook a brother up??

Build a MPCNC and you can have both in the same machine. I'm 90% done with mine but I have very little time at the moment so won't be finished until the summer.
