I'd do 30mph on an under hundred dollar bike but not a board. Shocking prices. This must be the lowest priced board sold.

It says 50kph so maybe you have to stand on it and go down a hill aaaand you get a receiver with it :smiley:

@Hummie or forks with wall sockets :smiley:

I mean it´s already really hard to get a descent battery under 100 bucks :D

One of my earliest memories is sticking a fork in the wall socket.

They have amazing photoshoppingskills aswell. The logo removal in the middle is barely noticable. Suprised it doesnt stay "TARY" on it :D

Good effort ;)
