Not that I care :face_with_raised_eyebrow:

but Boosted have dropped their branded decks & trucks with their new boards...

https://boostedboards.com/blog/the-next-generation-of-boosted/

gone to a deck mounted electronics lid as well, that won't win over some fans either :thinking:

Looks to me like they are trading in a zero rake cheap cast truck with a name, for a new precision machined truck without a name...I would call that a win if the design is descent enough, obviously machined is better than cast, so don't knock the move to drop Caliber unless you tried the new trucks and they suck...I wanna see pics of these new trucks..

HA!
They most certainly are.

They say that as if 20MPH is abusive.

They chose the wrong loaded decks for that sort of durability, but its not like bulletproof decks don't already exist.

They probably don't get that when skaters hear "Precision machined" that we expect it to mean "Billet CNC"

So what it probably is, is just cnc'd in places.
Like the aluminum is trimmed on the ends of the axle for a precision bearing interface, a machined pivot cup, or bushing seat.

Or it could be the guy who made the advert just didn't have a clue.

This is from their webpage «...the trucks will now be precision machined instead of cast, which results in a stronger final product and allows us to use much stronger aluminum alloys. Our new trucks are almost twice as strong as the previous generation – a massive improvement on such a critical part of the board.»

This killed their chances of me buying the shortboard.  I was excited about it.  They made the same critical mistake [Evolve](https://evolveskateboardsusa.com/products/carbon-gt-series?variant=7345468637233) and [Hyper Beast](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/hyper-beast-36-inch-deck-with-integrated-enclosure-update/42562) did.

The idea is to prevent water ingress and deal with it if it occurs.  The top mounted lid does not do that second part.  Which means I can't buy it, *because it has design flaws*.

I'm pretty sure it's just a griptape design. There's no screws in it for a lid, the screws you see is for the trucks. From the bottom it looks like the normal Boosted batteries, I believe they are interchangeable across all models. :)

Also, if you look at the closeups you can see the stuff is still bottom mounted.

I think like with everything, regardless whether it is computers or e-longboards, whenever something "different" comes along it will threaten the ones who are already fond of another "side". I guess the interesting part about these kind of discussions is that as passionate users of one or another, we rarely see a neutral answer, most people have strong opinions. Now in regards to Boosted, okay they are not bringing anything revolutionary to the table, but I think it's still always awesome to see products that push the industry forward even without re inventing the wheel. What Boosted just released may not appeal to everybody but props to them for taking the manufacturing in their own hands and specializing the different components to suit their vision. And progress by any brand is progress for everybody in the community. Some things will be better, some will be the same, but overall I personally think they took a step into the right direction and it doesn't threaten any DIY project builder out there. We are all here to enjoy the ride whether we are meticulous master builders that like to tinker with every screw of the machine or we simply fall in love with a pre built commercially available machine. But that's just my 2 cents, I hope I didn't trigger anybody.

I'm seeing that they dropped best-in-class proven third party parts for in-house unproven copycat versions, I'm guessing to improve their profit margins. I guess it's a natural progression.

Some guy who's given the new models a try has said the deck felt "more responsive". To me, that translates to meaning slightly different (but similar) layup with a little more rebound/stiffness to it. Honestly sounds plenty fine to me. I think people need to get over this "cheapened parts" talk about Boosted. They're shifting production to in-house production, which means they get more horizontal control over their product quality and construction. I don't know where all this undeserved hate is coming from. That's literally the goal of every company. To compartmentalize production and move things in-house for better control over your product. Also, contrary to popular belief, it's not hard to get decently casted urethane wheels. Hummies, Ollin, Enertion, Boa, Exway, I, and countless other Downhill longboarding companies proved that. A quick phone call to Labeda and a decent wad of cash is all you need to get up and running.

The thing that stands out is they went from Caliber trucks to in-house trucks in v2, and the trucks are cracking and breaking. This can be perceived as cost cutting, or just that trucks are hard to get right on the first few tries.

And I don't think I'm off in thinking the deck shape looks awfully like a Vanguard? With programmed flex? I hope they worked something out with Loaded so both parties are happy.

That's all I have on where the hate comes from. :) Although in my case, "hate" is a little strong. Otherwise I really do wish them good luck, I was not being sarcastic about that.

Someone deduced a while back that the issue was not the material of the trucks themselves that were the issue, but a design issue. Basically there was certain amount of stress being applied to the trucks (via the motor mount) which causes the breaking of several trucks. Even Caliber is made in Taiwan/China. And what's the issue with Boosted keeping a similar shape to the vanguard? That cutout is Boosted's identity/livelihood. Like hell they're going to try and completely deviate from that shape. Loaded isn't the only Triax Bamboo deck manufacturer in the world. IN fact there are several dozens of these manufacturers who can do just as capable of a job. Drang and DB Longboards come to mind. In fact, I just ordered a DB Longboards Coreflex deck just yesterday.

With the new mini I see all the competitor in really difficult situation since with 750$ they cover the middle price range and most of the people will opt for a Boosted. No more it cost half of a Boosted. I know that they are not using any superior elettronics, but the customer service, premium finishing look and the name behind will matter a lot. I still see market for the several 400$ boards (Meepo, Wowgo, ownboard ecc...) due to the difference price.

Don't get me wrong. I would always choose Carvon over than BB. I am talking about mass production boards for the average customers. To me I see still competition in who wants to spend over 1000$ then the game are still pretty much the same. Although probably people ready to pay for a V2 plus will opt for a mini. I mean of they live in a city short, same power, new, cheaper smash the choice with the bigger brother. I currently have a short board and it's way better than a long deck for a commute board. Anyhow I also think this mini has or will have swappable battery. By the pictures it seem to have an easy open lid on top.

So once I swapped wheel pulleys on my dual plus and got the extended battery (year later) top speed is almost 27 and even on a dead battery it still had decent speed left.  

Will I buy another? Probably not.  I don't think they are awful boards and they made huge strides for the eskate market.  It's 1/3 of the board cost spent on marketing? I think so.

I think BB will bring attention to the short board style,  as city commuter. Then if you can out your Banshee under the light next to the mini BB people that doesn't want belt drive can think about it. On the other hand I am afraid at the same price point they will choose the well known brand over the others. Just my opinion.

I expect plenty of people will choose the name brand over the new kid on the block. 

Regardless of whatever happens though, the Banshee gets a ton of PR for being presented as a legitimate Boosted challenger. We do only beat it in Stability/weight/range/speed/weatherproofness/motor noise (silent)/carry-ability/and a handful of other categories. Point being, it's a foot in the door for us. RIP those budget brands however, who's entire business model was all about being cheaper than the Boosted. Seems we're one of the few who's standing now, thanks to an actually competitive performing product.

Do you have any plans for a carvon style direct drive in the future? I think a reliable production board with that style drive would have a very large market. I don’t understand why other companies haven’t come out with a direct drive board, unless carvon has a patent on it already?

because of money. and mass production is hard as f. why do you think enertion is in trouble still, jed board been teaseing alllll years, even boosted need like 12 wks before they can start shipping. it took them 7 years to come up with in-house designed board.
I haven yet to tried carvon but beside changeable wheels  I don't see the point.
 it is quite expensive for the motor too which i understand why but usd 400 for the motors alone is too high.

@PredatorBoards keep it going with your style. I wish the wheels are a bit bigger tho, like standard 97mm, than u got my money.

Well technically it's not really any more expensive if you are buying quality parts. On a traditional belt build, besides two motors you have to add in the cost of trucks (or a single truck since Carvon doesn't include front), then two of each mount, wheel pulleys, motor pulleys,and belts, then it would take a while to adjust angles and tension, once everything is in place, every screw needs to be pulled out to apply loctite.

Speaking from experience holding (not riding) a Boosted Mini X (work and live in Silicon Valley):

- Build quality is superior to any off-the-shelf esk8 I've seen, by any company, at any price.  Super nice plastics and buttons and grip tape, etc.
- Wheels and trucks are also very nice (not Paris Savant / Otang 4Pres nice... but I'd say better than Paris+Bustin collab and much better than clones).
- Sounds just like a Boosted Board

The bad:

- I told Jamie at Red Ember I thought it was over 20 lbs! (their site says 17).  It feels super heavy, so much that I am not ordering one.
- I thought the Boosted hanger was forged but their site says it's machined, idk.  I didn't immediately recognize 'precision truck' is really what I mean.
- Deck has a neat shape and I like the tailbone, yet I wonder how good it will boardfeel on pavers or even coarse pavement.  I predict fatigue.
- The ER battery dorsal hump is huge and made it feel weird to hold (as much as I dislike handles on decks, the Riptide R1 got this right).

I really, really thought about buying one but didn't:

- The Mini X is slower than a used Boosted 2 Dual+
- It costs more than a used Boosted 2 Dual+
- It weighs more than a Boosted Plus (with the same range)

At $750 for the Mini, idk... I think the cheaper Boosted will carry better, until it runs out of battery in an hour, which might save my feet and knees in the long-run?  Hard sale. 

I'd rather have a DIY single motor on a world-class boardfeel deck like an Icarus, all things being equal.

Hope this helps!

Everyone wants Boosted to lower their prices, they remove their biggest costs and people complain.  Why don't we wait and see what the actual trucks, deck and wheels feel like before writing it off? Literally all their competition uses their own brand gear or Chinese generic parts so why can't they?

I think a cheaper boosted board is a good thing as long as the parts hold up.

I don’t understand the $400 difference between the mini x and boosted plus. Difference deck and wheels is all you get. The 2mph faster top speed I assume is due to wheel size or just software restrictions, I’m guessing that across all their boards the top speed is just determined by software settings, I can’t imagine the have 4 different kv motors.

Form is a function in itself. Your assertions about cracking screens and Battery life are fairly universal. I’m a clarity of concept person, in that what you have called ‘thermally crippled’, I see as focused on portability, I suppose some might kick up a stink about lack of ports as a lack of functionality, but that could be seen as a push towards a wireless future and the potential universality of USB C. 

If you have ever opened up any Apple product, I value the cleanliness and efficiency which is what i’d Call good design. Alternatively, you can throw in everything + the kitchen sink and dig through the spaghetti bowl that is the inside of any other laptop.

Different perspectives, no need to get snappy about it, haha.

> 
>  You will obviously get a much better board for the money if you make it yourself and pick out exactly what you need for what you are doing or where you wish to ride it. It isn't easy to learn everything it takes to make one, but if you already harbor some of the skills it's much easier. Some builders can also make them for you, those are the best boards there is because those people have experience building many high end DIY boards and can do it faster than you but you will pay for their time and labor, and you should...the Chinese completes on the market are not designed by skaters and suffer major design flaws and you truly get what you pay for...most of them are hardly even skateboards and truly designed to just be purchased and take people's money, many of them die and are not repairable within a few hundred miles where-as a nice DIY will go forever with maintenance and off the shelf replaceable parts..

You can't count your own labour as your wage pay. I call that BS.
when you are having fun making it, you can't call it labour because it does not produce nor return any usefulness back into society.
Normally if you having fun via hobby it cost not only labour of making and material but also cost of operating.
This hobby is bless because only thing u need to operate is your leg and outlet.
 which is why they can price it high, people can risk paying a bit more.
Beside non of those company offers what I want. despite the dollar they put up, all of them is off one way or another, especially the speed is very limited
german r&d wtf. shengen is where they produce the components.

so pls don't be a lawyer for any company. Apple has been a monster for such thing. I have never seen a macbook or iphone 4 and after without issues. people allowed this for becoming fan for million and billion dollar company.

look at go pro, they make terrible camera now because people will buy it anyways.

Interms of cost boosted put on for mini series is dead on. it is enought to get people into their "system" but keep the premium image and hopely they buy the premium down the road. very smart.

But Competition grew and it is time for them to come down a bit. or offer more unique

Carry your board how you want. Live and let live. It doesn't make a difference, and if people want to make fun of other people for *whatever about* skateboarding, they are just idiots.

I think Apple deserves a little extra for the design work they put in, but they have definitely started to gouge us excessively lately, though there are many marketing reasons why this makes sense. I'm not sure how Apple has confused you such that you don't know what you are paying for, their product spread is fairly concise.

Your inference is that art serves no functional purpose, that is a shallow notion. But even so, I propose Apple is highly functional and extremely performance driven through industrial design and engineering that is focused on the given single minded proposition. Flexibility and variability is inherently and fundamentally inefficient. By accommodating variation you introduce redundancy.

Focus on the user through engineered design is not unique to Apple and has nothing to do with marketing. Though results in brilliant marketing. Is it easy to sell great products, but don't get the sequencing confused.

You sir sound like you are drunk on apple marketing

By your measure, Microsoft is 'drunk' with their Surface range, Tesla is disrupting with their expanding lineup though 'drunk' and Enertion who is attempting to move in a similar vein must be lead by a 'drunk' also.

My point is simple. Engaging design is focused design, through precise engineering. Precision is inherently specialised, specific and therefore **expensive**. 
I'll give you the knock on Apple repairability, though the flip side of that argument is the positives of deep integration and optimisation. 

I am happy to argue/converse with you, but be a bit more mature about it, grow up a bit, somewhere beyond 14 would be nice.

Nah, I'm not going to spend time on appleheads.  I do that at work already.  I know how idiotic y'all are

It's like "Don't pray in my school and I won't think in your church"

Except apple

Again with the non constructive commentary that adds precisely nothing to the conversation. I am a ‘design’head to use your crude analogy.  

If you have nothing worth saying, consider saying nothing at all for it seems there is no hope for the lost.

It really isn't that much effort at all.
