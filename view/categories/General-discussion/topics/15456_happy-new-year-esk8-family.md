Happy new year everyone! 2017 is going to be a wild ride.

@JohnnyMeduse I'm working on an 4wd track driven snow e-board that will let you keep riding though the snow :P Hopefully it will be ready next year!

Happy New year! 2017 should be a very interesting year (hopefully good) and definitely good for DIY ESk8 scene. Looking forward to riding with ANY of y'all. Lol. ESk8 life would be pretty lonely without the interwebs, at least around where I live. Still the most fun you can have on four tiny wheels though! :confetti_ball:

I knew @Michaelinvegas would make this thread lol. Happy new year my dudes! It's so amazing to be around people I can connect my esk8 brain with. You know how hard it is to talk about esk8 at the dinner table? üòÇ I'm sure there will be some sick shit in 2017 and I will continue to expand DIY esk8 around my area. We're at 8 members now! I've definitely got some cool things planned!

HAPPY NEW YEAR!!!

Just about 40 and just learned how to esk8!  Well, more like learning.  Built first board as a combo of a three six with  single drive.  Enclosure is muy diy toolbox enclosure from ACE hardware that I kind of spray painted an alumumium color to match the 3-6.  Still learning and tweaking, but I did drop some coin on the Kickstarter campaign.  Happy NY to all!
