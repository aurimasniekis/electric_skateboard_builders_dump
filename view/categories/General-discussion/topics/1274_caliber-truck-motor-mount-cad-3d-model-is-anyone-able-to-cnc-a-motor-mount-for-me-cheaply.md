Does anyone know of any CAD or 3D model files for a motor mount designed for Caliber trucks. I've found a couple on thingiverse, but they are not adjustable and I am not good enough with CAD editors to edit them myself. I just want to be able to CNC or print a mount that can be screwed on to the caliber trucks, but I may have to resort to welding. Alternatively, if anyone has access to a mill and would be able to cnc me a mount at a reasonable price that would be amazing.
