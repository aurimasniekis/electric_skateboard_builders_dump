as I don't like chain drive, because it very easy to got dirty.  today I saw a chain protector on a bike, I think this could use on chain drive boards as well.

Looks like just split wire loom tubing.
Not bad, those are cheap.

What a super idea, now all dirt that gets into the chain will stay there and has no chance to leave :slight_smile:

Protecting pants:
- roll them up
- use something that tighten them to your legs
You don't need so stupid "inventions", they make life harder no easier, so what's the point?

No, there's no chance dirt with stay in the chain cause the plastic tubing gonna fly-off in high RPM :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:.
