I'm wondering if someone has made a skeletonized deck... something that has about as much hole as deck?  And yes I know it's awful for a deck because weakness and esk8s in particular because where do you mount stuff...just wondering if it's been done before

Several have been done out of metal. Landyachtz has a few sweet ones that have a colored film over a skeleton frame.

Trampa discontinued the HS11 and is sticking with the Holypro. And the electric holypro has holes everywhere

So possible but very uncommon, good to know!  (Doing preliminary work on a very special esk8 deck...if it ever comes out it will be something extremely uncommon)

This kind of pattern ![image|310x174](upload://akZOx9FEJj6pHIxf6Zy2kz0E3gC.jpeg) ![image|658x226](upload://hNs7sVTRZ4KBU0AhqRdAqeXIxl9.jpeg)

Exactly what I was looking for!  Gonna do something that isn't aluminum or wood though
