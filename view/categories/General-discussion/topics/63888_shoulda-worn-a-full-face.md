Be sure to get yourself checked out. Head injuries are f****** weird. I had a bad crash a few years ago, thought I was fine . day later started getting really sick. Late brain swelling. Just make sure someone keep an eye on you man

if i remember correctly the doctor always tells you to have someone wake you up in the night and ask you questions and see if youre still all there and not bleeding into your brain through the night unknowingly.   or give you a phone call in the middle of the night.

if you've got memory loss and nausea, it's a symptom of a concussion.  don't take that lightly, may be worth getting it checked out.

Damn dude. Hope you heal up soon. Did you go to the ER? Head injuries are no joke. Don't be alone tonight in case anything worse happens and you need to go to the hospital. I'm sending good vibes your way.  And dark, vengeful, mercilessly evil vibes to that useless waste of life that did this to you. I hope he gets eaten by a bear.üêª

Fast recovery, @Bobby! 
The other day two little punks on electric bike were trying to scare me, but the maggots didn't consider they were coming from my back side and I can't see them. When I saw them we were on a collision course, I jumped aside and the crash was avoided but the ligaments on my right knee are stretched.
As a result I am off the board\bike at least 10 days :angry:

Thanks for the well wishes guys. Ive been a part of this community for about 4 months and I make sure to check in and read at least twice a day. I consider many of you friends although we have never met and especially the ones I have met. YOU GUYS ARE THE BEST!!!. I Just ended up taking meds and passing out. My head was always ok, it was my face that got effed in the A.  Teeth almosst went through my lips.  Ive had several concussions and this didnt feel like one. Ill see how I do at and after work. Gotta save up for that full face because there is no way im leaving Eskate.... ever!

@Bobby Glad you're doing ok. The Ruroc Onyx is $183 shipped and has a GoPro mount on the visor. I'm not sure if it's the best helmet option for you, but it's a special deal for us right now. And riding with a GoPro might not be a bad idea.

I'm actually guilty of this. Almost every time I finish a new build I go top speed esting which is dumb as hell.  I SHOULD be getting used to the feel of the deck and the handling nuances.

**_As a general rule plan for the fall not the ride._**  

The ride gets a lot better when your skill level and confidence match your runs ü§ò

@Deckoz I never though of it like that... I like going fast and have wiped at 25+mph and the worst was when a car hit me from the side and sent me flying... but besides tht I have always put my hands and knees down or tucked for a roll. Also guys, as soon as u fall, ditch the remote for the board it's safer if u throw it than if u hold on to it and it breaks and cuts u or u scrape ur knuckles to hell

Honestly im not offended but i will disagree. I have fallen many times before and roll out no issues. Several factors were at play... it was night out, my light was broken amd in my hand, i was in a tuck and my biggest mistake was that inwas over confident. Ive ridden that path so many times, i got cocky and paid the consequences.... ive eaten shit going a lot faster and had minimal damage but yea... i wasnt being as observant and paid the price

It sucks to get hurt, but I find getting hurt and knowing WHY you got hurt is the fastest and most permanent method to learn.

I've done the same, I ride the same neighborhood every week with my brother. I found myself barely paying attention and hit some sand and turned into a bearded esk8 tornado and wiped out spectaculary üòÅ. 

Now I watch for sand subconsciously all the time, lesson learned.

Again no worries. Its all coming from a positive place. Just saying i dont think it was not being skilled enough, just someone who got careless and became to cocky with his routeüòñ

And by no means am I a pro. I recently had dual 6374‚Äôs and after blowing a focbox, i made it a single. I enjoy this much more and dont think i need the crazy acceleration the dual provides.

Sorry about your Wipeout.  I recently got a new helmet for eMTB and Eskate. It's hot in El Paso so I got the Fox Proframe. Super light and DH rated since those guys hit huge jumps and travel at high speed on gravity runs.  ![image|375x500](upload://AqM5Tjzn0XakMP2Wj9I1lzffk2P.jpeg)![image|375x500](upload://eb35010VBhnY6DJArHIKME4PE6.jpeg)

Plenty of vents to keep you cool.
