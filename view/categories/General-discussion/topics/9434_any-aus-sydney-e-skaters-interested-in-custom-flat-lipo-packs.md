Just to gauge interest, I have been soldering packs for a decent amount of time now and am considering offering it as a service for fellow e-skaters in the area (I don't want to hassle with shipping Lipos, we would have to meet somewhere in Sydney to make our exchanges though if it is possible to easily ship Lipos under a capacity I would be open). Would anyone be interested/what would you think a fair price would be?

I am quoting @barajabali
_Basically I would charge cost of material plus 20 percent labor so I am completely transparent._  

I think that is a nice model.
