I bought 50 degree caliber 2 trucks to start my board, but I found that my board added 4 degrees on top of that. So I bought a wedge kit from khiro to counteract that. I tried 50/50 (front/rear) and I felt I had to slow down in turns. So I tried 50/44 and felt a big improvement so I tried more combos and ended up at 42 degree front 35 degree rear. Now I'm much more confident in turns and actually look forward to them taking them at full speed. I can only go 18mph till I can up my voltage when I get my vesc but that's still a pretty fast turn. With these truck angles it feels more fluid as well like I have way more leverage, but at the same time there is more room for error like adjusting foot placement at speed. It feels better carving on sidewalks. I haven't noticed gain in turn radius if anything I feel like I can turn sharper. Now I might have to get myself 44 degree calibers because my wedges are getting out of hand lol. I run 12 degree wedge front and 19 rear to get 42/35 because my board ads 4° somehow.<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/2/20b7cb41c790611e628bc9f29664f796d5f9eca8.jpg" width="666" height="500"> what degree trucks do you run?

Thats tall for a 2 piece wedge and I'm afraid that it would become unstable at speeds above 20mph
When I was riding at 10-15mph, I was able to run soft bushings and semi loose 50deg trucks and it felt stable.
But when I started hitting speeds 20-35mph, everything changed. Now i'm running 44deg Caliber 2 trucks with ¼" risers front and back.
Riptide 90a double barrel bushings in front and 95a in back.
Front bushings tight and back bushings very tight.

@Namasaki although the wedges are tall it only adds about 1/4 inch to the ride height. I actually want to get 44 calibers so i can run a 1/4 inch shock pad for dampening and more motor clearance.  

Do you like those bushing it's their aps formula right? Not to much rebound? I was going to get their wfb formula because it has less rebound.

They are the aps cannon bushings and I'm using wfb 96a pivot cups

Lol my first time I hit 25mph, I was running 45 degree paris clones with the bushings very loosely tightened. The speed wobbles were real. I've since switched to a mtb, and now use mbs ats 12 trucks mounted on a 15 degree angle and they are more stable at high speeds (I run mbs medium bushings and tighten the rear bushings a lot more than the front).

A friend of mine who works at the local skate shop and who does a lot of downhill up to 50mph told me about running the back tighter than the front for stability. He says "turn with the front wheels and the rear will follow.

Ya speed wobbles can get scary. 
I hit some rough asphalt while going over 30mph and it caused excessive vibration that turned into a wobble. I managed to hang on until I could get it under control. 
The difference between 25 and 30 mph seemed huge to me. Took me a while to get the nerve to go that extra 5mph. That was with my Carvon hub motors. I haven't gone over 28 with my belt drive setup.

This is why I've switched to pneumatics. I have a smooth ride and I can run over pretty much anything on the road.

Your gonna see more speed and quicker acceleration with 10s

I'm going to try a Randal 42 baseplate with my calibers hangers I read it works with little modification

I've never ridden a board with pneumatics I imagine it has a lot of drag like when you let go of the throttle

I have a similar setup to @Namasaki (dual carvons).

I have a Randal 42 baseplate laying around.  I was going to try on the rear and keeping the regular funbox baseplate in the front.  Was going to see if that was enough to make things a bit more stable for higher speeds but still responsive enough at lower speeds.

@Namasaki have you tried a mixed setup with just the 44 in the back?

@TheWrongHombre I think you should give it a try. Idk if the parts are interchangeable for those two trucks, but I did try 50/44 combo and definitely felt improvement. It feels more responsive like I can use the trucks full range of motion. Where I felt the most improvement is in high speed corners you feel locked in and gets rid of the feeling that you're going to get flung off

Well, do I have good news for you!
The funbox hanger that comes with the Carvon hubs fits perfectly on the Caliber II base plates with no modification needed. So you can easily set up your Carvons at 44 deg. 
I did try 44 back and 50 front and it was better than 50/50. 
Then I tried 44/44 and that's even better. 
You could even add a small wedge and make it 40deg. 
I think if you go lower angle, you can run softer bushing and maintain stability. But I'm not sure because I haven't tested that theory yet. 
I'm I'm not sure that the difference would be much. 
Going from 50/50 to 44/44 didn't make a huge difference and I still have to run hard tight bushings.

I got some 50 deg caliber trucks, So do you think by just adding a wedge on the rear truck and decrease the angle would do the job, rather then buy a 44 degrees baseplate?
Thanks in advance

```
I suppose it will work if you can get a wedge with small enough transition. 
Getting a 44deg base is the optimum.
There are sellers the sell just one truck. 
I wound up putting 44deg on the front as well.

Sorry I just saw the conversation above, I didn't realize the answer was up there hha.. 
I ll probably experimenting with some wedges first, inorder to find the right set up, then I ll probably buy the 44

Higher degree gives more turning 
Lower degree gives more stability

@zool774 I have a khiro wedge kit it works well but it's pricey. It was worth it to me because I feel so much more comfortable riding my board. I didnt notice much difference in straights but in turns it's worlds of difference. A kit is also good because you can experiment with lower angle in the rear than the front since the front does most of the steering. Keep in mind you want double barrels at least for 44° trucks. If you want max lean look into riptide bushings.

I really like riptide 93a wfb for 44/38 angle trucks and I'm 200 pounds. I run 95a bushings in rear currently but plan to buy another set of 93a to try. I haven't tried aps formula yet and have a set on order. Riptides chart is pretty accurate for which bushing u should get. For comparison in my 50 calibers I used venom 89 barrel and 85 cone before I found out about riptide.

I was looking at their website, they really got a large variety  of different types and  different duros, I was almost overwhelmed by it haha. 
I think I'll go with barrels on top, 93awbs, and the chubby 88at the bottom,dront and back. 
Hey is the 10001 on your nick refering to a zipcode?

I would recommend trying 93wfb barrels just in the front to see if you like them and go from there. I tried the 88 barrel and it was way too loose and I like it loose. The type of washer makes a big difference as well if its flat or cupped. I currently run precision flat washer all around. Flat washer feel more leany and don't have that rebound at the end of the turn. Wfb and flat washer be careful with wheel bite.

i just run standard caliber II 50s and have zero issue carving through turns at 20+ mph on a 27" wheelbase. The trick is to get the tension on those bushings just right for your style.

It's preference I guess. I see my electric longboard as making everything a downhill. Lower angle trucks are made for downhill. Add riptide bushings and it feels lively and can carve with the best of them.

One thing I just learned is if you put gulf wax or parrifin wax in the pivot cups it makes it so much smoother and has the added benefit of getting rid of any squeks

Im using riptide pivot cups from 96wfb urethane just because of that effect. feels supersmooth and never squeaks again!

my caliber setup is riptide krank barrel 93 boardside, 87 roadside with precision cupped washers. the krank formula is pretty cool, because it changes the dura noticeably by pressure, so you can tune the basis setup quite well just with the kingpin nut! :slight_smile:

I'm running 50 front and 44 rear. By accident though. I also have 1/2 inch risers.
I was wondering how tight you guys torque down the bushings, because I've tightened them alot but would still like a stiffer setting due to the height of the setup.

I also have 1/2 inch risers and 90mm wheels but also have a very concave deck that allows me to really dig into turns without any issue. This is without a motor though, so I can only speak for under 12mph ultra-hard turns.

50 front and 44 rear is oretty cool though, im also used to a turnier front and a stiffer rear, also helps with the single motor drive steering impulses!

about your bushing: you cant really tune much by tightening the kingpin nut more and more ... youll eventually just split your bushings but they wont really get much harder. if you want a stiffer setup, buy harder bushing or trade stock caliber cone against a barrel, in any case: use cupped washers!

Yeah I was having issue with riot pivot cups so i waxed them and now they feel like bearings. I have riptide pivots in the bag for my new 44 cals. Wfb is self lubricating but I'll wax them to see if there's a difference

There are no issues with mounting a enertion 190kv motor on a 44 degree caliber truck right? There is enough room for the motor to not come in contact with the board or the ground?

Hi I'm almost finished with my skateboard however I just tested it and I had a normal sized truck that I modified to fit the motor mount from enertion and everything just fell off. What trucks should I be using for this? I looked for a while and don't see anything specific in terms of wider trucks to fit the wheel, the drive pulley, and the motor mount. Suggestions?

Hey I downhill longboard don't have the time to charge a bat but you guys hit some speeds that I reach I usually hit 65km on my longboard on hills I do daily but I what to go faster I have 2 50caliber trucks. Front truck is tight back truck is tighter. I what to get different degrees should I spend the big bucks and go for 30 deg back 44 deg front get it over with or can I chince out and just buy one set of 40 or even 30 and a 50 in the front
