Without a doubt Jason has brought a change into the DIY esk8 community with his level of expertise and knowledge. Doesn't he deserve some love and cooperation?

I bet a market analysis showed that more and more possible customers go the DIY route.
this is the last attempt to reach them.
If someone who is not sure either to buy or to build one by himself reads this, maybe he thinks he cant do it and buys one of the evolves.

Definitely agree, previously they were hyping the capabilities of their single inrunner motor and now they have seemingly changed that into a more rational one, even though Jason and the DIY community has "evolved" much faster. Its going to be a tough battle ahead with Enertion's modular based design, Jason can really set a new market for the esk8 community as a whole.

And with this, I have lost any respect I had for evolve. This is pure propaganda to convince people to buy there boards. Thumb control from my experience is much easier and more intuitive. Saying the trigger is more intuitive is bs,

Great job at getting the diy community, which has respected your work, to hate you. You gave a middle finger to us, and we will give it right back to you.

Thumb control personally has also been more comfortable. They have and are doing their marketing right, luring in customers through various biased opinions.

The funny part, is this is just more motive for me to finish my diy builder website. I would be done with it by now if I wasn't working on building boards myself also. By the time this tool is done, evolve can't say diy is much harder at all then buying a complete.

That was part of my point. Some feel trigger is easier, some feel thumb is easier. Making a statement saying one is factually more intuitive then the other is bs and a lie.

Also, saying only recently, 2 motors has become a better option then 1 is bs. People having been having great results with 2 motors for years. There's no big change recently that have made motors that much better.

Kah Bam. This topics going to fire up. @onloop if you chime in only respond with facts. We already know this is marketing from EV. as some of the giys have already pointed out. At the end of the day we all just want to have fun.

To add my point. So for $1950 Aus they don't think soneone can get an DIY board up. Maybe not in the time, but that is part of the fun. The waiting for parts is a bore though.

What part of their argument is valid?

- "Only recently has motor technology evolved enough to allow good performance from two motors" - Straight up lie. Nothing else to say about that.
- "The index finger is the most intuitive way to control and feel anything" - True for some, not true for others (like me who feel the thumb is better)
- "Making your own electric board sounds easy, but its not. It requires a lot of time, practice, tinkering, and money!" - Now there's some truth to this. If you do proper research, you can build your own board for far less then evolve, and with little tinkering. It really depends on the parts you choose to use. Generally speaking, it does take longer, and more money than cheaper pre-made boards. But certainly, anyone can build a board cheaper than evolves prices.

I see a lot more bs than truth.

there is a lot of crap on that page... but the DIY bit.. to me, its a no brainer. I can make a better board than evolve. I have the skills.
however some people might not have the skills or the inclination. Most people just want to hand over their money and ride whats given to them.

I come from a car background. its the same there.. I like to work my own car myself. Most people just want to drop the car off at the shop and pick it up all built.
there is plenty of people with plenty of money that will happily buy ready to ride boards.

I think the decisions have already been made for those people. evolve are fishing for the fence sitters.

its no surprise that everyone who sells boards are going to tell you that theirs are the best.

I also have used thumb control and trigger control extensively and find that they both work well for me.
I agree that it's a matter of personal preference, not one is better than the other.

in a situation where a jerk of your forearm might tighten your grip, the trigger isn't the better solution. At least with the thumb it is easier for it to slip off and around the controller. Now whether the board jerks or not is another situation.. So one can be better than the other in a safety or procedural type of way :wink:

Evolve said my GT should be arriving to them this week after which they'll ship out. My DIY is still pending space cell, ollin vescs, ollin motors, and enclosure. Ordered the ollin stuff about 3+ weeks ago and the space cell+ enclosure 5/20.

My point was the GT is the first board evolve has made that may compete with speed/torque/distance with a lot of our DIY builds. How long did it take? And the sidewinder trucks are pretty much proven to suck above the 25mph mark compared to RKP trucks. 

Saying most of what he says means nothing to most of us who know he cloned the truck design and straight  up followed the DIY community on outrunners in a dual set up.

Lol indeed I will @Jinra  Evolve said (in an email to me) they would be getting their shipment early this week, weeks ago. Hopefully mine will get shipped by the end of the week assuming they get the boards on time as planned. I have a lot of videos in store, although it may be a little longer until I do the top speed test as I waited too long to get the 97mm and now they are on backorder. Could get from evolve but then I miss out on the 83mm.

I will be posting all Raptor and GT videos on my youtube channel -- eSk8 -- my friend also has a Boosted coming back from service around the same time so I will be comparing all three as well....exciting things to come :p

I had gotten clones but someone with the board confirmed that none of the clones sold anywhere will fit due to the thick spokes -- they would have to be modded which I didn't feel like doing since I paid $60 for them and some people paid $27...would rather fuck up a cheaper pair later.

Hmmm...thats not a bad idea, modding the gear..one gear for clones one gear for regs, might actually do that instead tbh with this lead time being so long and Evolve will likely charge out the ass for them. How much did you pay for an extra gear? Can you link where on their website you got it

Edit found it: https://evolveskateboardsusa.com/collections/spare-parts/products/drive-wheel-for-83mm-and-90mm-abec-11-wheels

$60 for two gears, hmm...Found clones on eBay for about $28 shipped, so combine that together and its about the same price as retail 97mm. If you want anything between 80-97mm in another color it is as cheap as ~$30 after that. Not bad..

Please do post pictures and measurements if you successfully mod them.

They want to push their product and with that often comes a lot of marketing BS. Anyone who does their research will easily come to the conclusion that going the DIY route is not as difficult as it would seem. With a little know how, you can put together a board of the same level of quality for less, and get exactly what you want. On the other hand, some people are getting exactly what they want in an Evolve. 

I rode an Evolve Gen2 Bamboo for a bit, but ended up selling. Didn't like the sidewinder trucks or the trigger controller. Sold it to a guy who rides sidewinders and liked the trigger. To each their own. I started with an E-GO and thought the Evolve would be a nice upgrade. Turned out, after a few mods, I liked riding my E-GO more.

Hey kind of random, but I'm one of those fence riders you were talking about just a minuet ago and am needing a little convincing to build my own board vs buying the evolve. I was about to buy the Evolve straight up no questions asked after months of research and years of dreaming of a board like this. A few years ago got hooked on the idea when I saw the Zboard but it's been left in the dust. So I guess my questions are, if I pay top dollar for my own handmade custom wooden board can I potentially reach the range and distance the new Carbon GT can? Also that Evolve remote is so sick, is there a way I can use it on my potential DIY board? Finally is a wooden board going to be too heavy to have the speed, distance, and torque the carbon fiber delivers? cause lets be honest, wood will always look nicer and be more aesthetically pleasing.

[/quote]
Well judging by how doubtful most people here are of its range due to what they can currently reach with their own builds with a similar battery, I'd say no. But then again, that max range advertised on the GT is done via a slower mode that limits you to around 16mph with reduced torque. So in GT or Fast you could expect to get a range of around 22-25 miles I'm guessing. Will test when I get mine. [quote="riftboard42, post:32, topic:4918"]

[/quote]

Probably not without doing quite a lot of modification, even I don't think it would work as it is quite complex like the Boosted remote. I have no experience messing with remotes so I'm not the best source -- but someone else is trying to do the same with the Boosted remote and it looks like it is fairly difficult. Evolve remote has an LCD and an interface -- so I imagine there's a lot more to it and you'd probably have to write your own software.[quote="riftboard42, post:32, topic:4918"]

Weight of the board does not really affect speed/distance/torque. Ask @Photorph he has a wooden board from @longhairedboy that can hit 38mph with around 20 miles of range -- it weighs about 21 lbs I think.  If anything more weight means more of those things as you can pack in more battery power. I'd be worried about portability though.

Keep in mind, the US pre-orders for the GT will be opening up potentially in a few days as they get their first shipment. So be ready to make a decision if you want a board this summer. One thing to also note is wait time can get ridiculous, but it could all be worth it in the end. Personally I decided to go the complete route first and do my own build later. Mainly because I need something reliable to get to work on, and I don't want to be without an eboard all summer waiting for parts.

@riftboard42 My complete board is 21.2 lbs of solid maple wood, mainly because the board itself is huge and heavy.   I am pretty confident it can beat the evolve in range.  The last test I did I got 23.4 miles or something along those lines and that was with 23% battery left.  When comparing range you also have to look at the speeds you were going at.  The first test I did got less than 20 miles of range, but I was also going 30-37 mph pretty frequently and that eats batteries.  

Using a lighter board than mine and the same components (enertion R spec, ollin VESCs, enertion mounts, 12s4p battery with BMS) you can build a dual drive board to beat the evolve GT in any way possible.  You can tune the throttle response to whatever you want using BLDC software for the VESC...I have no idea how to do this yet but I hear it's not that hard.  There's also gear ratios and pulley sizes. 

I opted for a gentler start (less acceleration) and more top end.  Something like the raptor has more low end torque but less top speed.  So you can really get a board tailored to your needs if you build one yourself, or have someone build it for you.  My board is 440 watt hr.  I just saw something on ollinboard's youtube that has a **750 Wh battery**.  The DIY world will always be ahead of the commercial boards, there is no way they can compete in performance or range.  But what they do offer is ease...you just buy the board and be done with it, and if you have any issues send it back to them for warranty repair.  

The evolve GT is no doubt an awesome board, the best complete commercial board in the market most likely.  So you can't go wrong either way.

Their statement is true.
Wait for parts : check
Waste time: check
Get frustrated: check

Evolve (and Boosted etc..) are aiming for riders who just want to ride as hassle-free as possible.
Those chosing to go the DIY route generally know what they're getting into and like to tinker with stuff.
But doing DIY aint cost effective by a long shot. I'd love to see the budget people eventually end up spending on their hobby. I probably could have bought two Evolves with the money I spent on stuff to tinker with.

Depends on what you want. If you buy an Evolve and it turns out to not be your thing, you lose a lot of cash there. If you go the DIY route, you may end up spending more in the long run, but you'll end up with the perfect board. 

If you get an Evolve and don't like the remote, you're kind of screwed. If you go the DIY route and don't like your remote, you just go out and buy another one like.

Those few lines of text from Evolve are the most pathetic attempt at trying to move people away from any kind of DIY passion they may have.  Hopefully whoever reads that will gain even more motivation to build their own board.  Much respect to Jason, he was even congratulating Evolve in a recent vlog for how far they've come.  There will be people that simply don't have the time to build a board, which is fair enough.  For those that can and do want to go the DIY route, rock on! :D :sunglasses:

Going the DIY ESk8 route has been the most fun and interesting rabbit hole I've gone down in a looong time. As well polished as the Evolve is (or any other pre-built for that matter), it could never satisfy my desire to customize and my urge to DIY something. All things that would surely impact the resale value, I'm sure. Lol. 

I guess if you REALLY don't have time to spend researching, building and tinkering, AND have the $1k - $2k to drop on a complete all at once, AND have the ability to keep your hands off everything besides the remote, AND don't mind riding the exact same board as your neighbor, AND don't mind being patient for months (years?) for your "perfect" board to be released, AND don't mind being bored(less) for weeks (months?) should you have to send it back for warranty repair, AND don't want the ability to easily scare or humble yourself by trying to make it go as fast as you can handle, AND have a matching iPhone (no offense, but kind of what I compare a complete to, adjustability wise), then I say GO FOR IT!! I can't honestly say that I'm not a little jealous of those that end up with a Raptor, Scarlet/Phat Matson, Flux, Evolve and maybe a few others, but I don't fit ANY of my made up description above, so it would have to be a 2nd or 3rd or 4th board for me, and I've kind of already annihilated my initial budget and then some. :money_mouth: 

For roughly the price of a new Evolve, over the course of about 3-4 months, I've already amassed enough parts to build about 3-4 complete, working boards (running 2 so far), and have almost endless possibilities of configuring different setups on 6s-12s, single or dual drive, hubs or satellites, big wheels, bigger wheels, kicktail, drop deck, long range, short range, etc. This is just with the parts I have now, plus the ability to swap components if something breaks, if I get bored with a setup, or just need to repair something. Plus, I had my first board up and running in less than a month after placing orders for parts, through a combination of buying parts I verified were in stock locally/domestically, and avoiding potential problem areas that could delay my first build, e.g., VESC's, international purchases, pre-order items, etc. Don't get me wrong, I do plan to get VESC's sometime soon, and have pre-ordered some items internationally, but the waiting game is sooo much easier when you already have a working board(s) to play with. I don't mind extended delays to complete my NEXT build, but not on my FIRST build. Plus, most tried and true DIY parts seem pretty easy to sell, if need be. 

So, to each there own. I know there will be plenty of people out there buying up completes, and more power to them if it makes them happy. We can all still ride together (and hopefully keep up :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:), and be part of this awesome industry/community. But as long as there are people (and vendors) like us, and forums like this, no amount of marketing, technology or bullshit will beat the DIY spirit and make me lay down my skate tools and soldering iron. :middle_finger::muscle::nerd::hugging:

Just sayin' :v:

That's basically my customer. They want custom but they don't have $1500 for soldering irons, spot welders, heat shrink tube, wires, pliers, strippers, allens, wrenches, glue guns, nickel strips, screws, bolts, washers, fiberglass consumables, solder, connectors, meters, diy jigs, deck presses, and other bullshit required to build a board. And they don't want to spend their time researching motors, ratios, BMSs, cells, chargers, drive systems, remotes, and other stuff. They just want to ride and they know what they want and they want somebody else to build it, but they don't want the same board everyone else has. 

My other customer would be the enthusiast collector tinkerer who wants to start off with something they can ride now and be able to mess with and tune more later. 

Fortunately some of these people have money.

no, wood is not too heavy. I'm starting to make wood core with a layer of carbon fiber for strength.

If you want to build something yourself, standard build for a belt & pulley system is a motor of 190-200kv, 3:1 gearing ratio, and use parts known to work well. r-spec is a perfect motor, vesc is a perfect esc. That's 50% of the struggle of making a diy board right there done for you.

my thoughts are ~

1)  if you're so THRILLED & IMPATIENT to ride an e~board , get a "Ready~To~Ride"   one ,  then , when some parts start to give problem , you will contact customer service to rectify the problem . also takes a few days if not weeks for them to reply . but hey !  you already landed your feet on that self~moving board . 


thrill experience down to 50% .



2) after experiencing the RTR eboard . then you might want to embark on that DIY journey . 
tune some speeds and torque .

If that DIY verbiage drove you away, maybe you shouldn't be building your own board anyway.

I'm waiting for the Boosted 2.0 because I like their design. There's no way I can drill holes and hide wires under the grip tape and make it look good. At the same time, I'm waiting for parts to build my own board that will outperform the Boosted Board.

I think you are absolutely correct on this.  I agree they are fishing for the fence sitters.  It's all fair game in business and marketing, You can't blame them.  I think Enertion could really help pull in those in between people by offering a DIY kit.  A one click buy for everything you will need minus the deck.  One of the most difficult parts of building a DIY E-board is knowing what to buy in the first place.

Just a thought.

Maybe first constructive comment in this thread. Nice work mate, and agree. Based on the common commentary I read, I also feel the scene needs a more reliable/ robust VESC version and a higher quality/ more capable remote, and then it will blow things wind open in terms of parity of offerings (for those fence sitters seeking a bit more polish or reliability from the get go). For every thread reinforcing the virtues of getting in there DIY, to the fence sitter there is another that is fault finding mysterious VESC failures, or poor controller connection, functionality or form factor. Everything else is there. Also, rather than being butt hurt and whiny, we shouldn't forget e-skateboarding is addictive, and no matter how people first get into it, it'll probably lead to a bigger DIY community as the bug bites. I feel the purchase of DIY kit from non-community vendors hurts DIYers more than the garbage Evolve puts in their FAQ.

Don't sell yourself short. Two years ago there was no way i could press my own decks. You can do whatever you decide you want to do if you decide you want it bad enough.

That's what they had in thier 6S kit that a lot of us bought a couple years ago. Enertion is slowly moving toward mass produced completes, so its hard to say if DIY will continue to be their main focus in the years to come. For now its a huge part, and the new space cells with their monolithic boxes in combination with thier proven drive trains are pretty much exactly what you're talking about. they just haven't lumped everything into one package yet like they did with the 6S package back when.

That's basically my customer. They want custom but they don't have $1500 for soldering irons, spot welders, heat shrink tube, wires, pliers, strippers, allens, wrenches, glue guns, nickel strips, screws, bolts, washers, fiberglass consumables, solder, connectors, meters, diy jigs, deck presses, and other bullshit required to build a board. And they don't want to spend their time researching motors, ratios, BMSs, cells, chargers, drive systems, remotes, and other stuff. They just want to ride and they know what they want and they want somebody else to build it, but they don't want the same board everyone else has.

Been meaning to comment on this. This is exactly the thing that held me off from doing my own build. As much as the freedom of being able to choose your own shit and building it from scratch is enjoyable, it is not by any means quick (for a non-engineer type anyway) to just get into, and requires quite a bit of thought and research (and $$ for tools). Coming from someone who didn't even know about eboards before watching Casey, I can say that I wanted nothing more than to just buy a board ready to go and join the fun that I saw someone else having.

The nature of DIY though is trial and error. The problem with this is that I use these things like my car 80% of the time. I don't have time to play trial and error with my board when I'm going to work. I just need it to work and if issues pop up already be expecting them because someone else with the same thing already went through it. That's the power with eboard completes. You have a community of people that are essentially beta testers for you, figuring out issues before you even come close to having them, and being able to help you fix your own when they come up. It's quite awesome. Whereas with DIY it can be a hit or miss, sure, someone may have had your issue, but your specific one could've been caused something completely different due to the unique nature of your own build -- making it harder to determine the root cause. I guess it's just a matter of how much **time** you're willing to invest... 

I definitely plan on doing my own build in the future, but for right now I have a specific goal which is to ride the fuck out of something this summer and make videos for people to understand how to use these things better / which one is the best for their needs.

I find it curious that Evolve would include copy to sway people away from DIY. I mean I get it, but it's not something Boosted has to do. They figured out their lane and are sticking to it. Can't really be mad at that. I like having an EGO and Boosted in my collection because when I organize my meetups there are usually younger kids or inexperienced Eboarders in the group. Letting them have a go on one of those is actually a lot safer and gives them the confidence to hop on one of our DIY boards. I mean DIY building is fun and its more fulfilling than buying a complete but it is only a small percentage of why I find DIY fascinating. When you are riding with 7 or more people, all with DIY boards - custom fit to them by a range of variables (resources, style, weight, etc.) is one of the most thrilling experiences I've ever had. I couldn't imagine having the same feeling if we all had the same board because there isn't that personal history attached to it.

Variety is awesome in many different areas of life. With esk8, at least where I live I rarely see another eboarder. I could imagine variety being important in dense esk8 areas like cali and NYC where everyone is on a Boosted. If I lived there I would definitely be more motivated to do my own thing. Right now esk8 where I am still doesn't really exist. So any board alone is unique in everyone else's eyes :p

Thank you so much @Photorph for your reply it helped me answer several questions before I make my decision. Last question I could ask is how long would you estimate it would take me to build a board that is the best the industry has to offer?(I'm having a deck being made with an image I really love on it, so there is a two month period right there but I could have all the pieces ordered and test it on my back up board and mount them on the finished product once it's in)

I'll be honest, if you're building a board there will be waiting and a lot of trial and error involved.  I'm planning a build with carvon hub motors, and wondering how long it will take also.  

You have to get things from multiple places if you want the best components.  For the speed controller for me there is only one option, the VESC and ollinboards in my opinion and based on my research has the most reliable VESC currently.  So you have to order that and wait for that.  Then you have to pick your motors, and motor mounts.  First you will have to decide on belt drive vs hub motors, once you do that then you have to figure out where you want to buy those from.  Many folks here selling DIY parts.  Then there is the battey, then the remote/receiver, then other things like wheels/trucks/risers, etc.  Honestly building a board will take a lot of trial and error and a lot of waiting and tinkering.  So do it if you really enjoy building.  Some of these parts can take months to get to you (like enertion motors/mounts).  

The other option you have is to have someone build you a board, I know longhairedboy on this forum builds some killer boards and presses his own decks.  He might even build you a board on a deck you send him, so that way you don't have to worry about needing to have all the tools and learning the BLDC tool for the VESC.  He built one for me and pressed a custom deck for me, so far it's been rock solid and is scary fast.  

The easiest would be just to get the Evolve GT which is a very good all arounder, and it should be shipped to you late July.  And this board won't be custom, but it's probably the best commercial complete as I've mentioned earlier.  

I think getting a LHB build or the evolve GT will definitely be faster than building your own board.  But building your own board will make you learn a lot, get frustrated a lot, may end up costing more, will take more time. but in the end it's something you built and you will know it inside/out.  So your call really.

Building your own may take longer, be more frustrating, and end up costing more, but you will most likely end up with a board you really love. 

One of the best parts about building your own is that you can swap parts out until you get that perfect board. You don't like your controller, pick up a new one. You want a drop deck, no problem. Just get a rear motor mount or hub and your good to go. Wheels, decks, motors, trucks, batteries... all can be swapped.

That "I have built this thing all by myself and it is going like hell" kind of feeling is hard to be beaten.

And it is fucking addicting....
