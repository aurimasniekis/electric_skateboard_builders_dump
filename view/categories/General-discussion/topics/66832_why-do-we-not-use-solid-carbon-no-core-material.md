	Hey why is solid carbon not used in eskate, skate or snowboard industry?
I’m currently building a mould to do some vacume forming. I was thinking of playing around with composites, but realised everyone out there is using a core material. I’m happy to use a core if I can not achieve a solid composite deck, but I would have to sandwich core material rather than wrap it which will reduce flex to nill.
Anyone know why solid carbon is not being used in the industry?

It doesn't have very good rigidity. W/o the core material it's too flexible and if you get any scratches in it, it'll create a stress point and crack the deck. Once you add in the core, it becomes rigid and 10x stronger.
