I've seen a lot of carbon fiber and fiber glass on decks and enclosures, what places do you get carbon fiber or fiber glass from?  All the places I've found are really expensive so I want to know what lesser know places you get them from are

Lol, in the western USA, if you can't find your khakis, you don't have pants. In the North, if you can't find your khakis, you can't drive.

Back on track, what @Sender said. Also, "FiberGlast" is worth subscribing to for emails. They do 20% flash sales at _LEAST_ once a month. Those sales are when I get my "other" materials (vacuum bagging film, Peel-ply, and Infusion-epoxy, etc). But for the reinforcement fabrics like Cahbin' Fibah or Fibah' Glass, Composite Envisions is the Keanu Reeves of suppliers. Definitely check out the CE's clearance items before shopping for the fabrics you had in mind originally. 

If your'e looking for Infusion Resin specifically, and don't mind dropping $290 for a GALLON sized kit of epoxy (which you would only want if you're manufacturing composites, or suck at infusion as much as I did at first), CE sells "PRO-SET" Infusion epoxy, which is as good as it gets. 

Cabin Fiber is expensive, and not for the faint of heart/moneys:

Edit: Sorry for making fun, but I have no control over it

Thanks!  This should make it much easier, still need to work out making really complex geometry

Carbon fiber is not good at "really complex geometry". It can be incredibly difficult to work with, and when you try to make it take a shape it doesn't want to, it will unweave its self!! FML, speaking from experience. It likes curves, the softer the better (me too). It's very challenging to get it right, **ESPECIALLY** if you don't do your research beforehand (like me)

But don't let me talk you out of it by any means!! I _actually_ recommend you try it. As long as you can afford the materials that you **WILL** waste as you are learning/experimenting. 

Feel free to ask if you have questions, this is one of my favorite things to talk about, besides Lipo batteries and Idler-pulleys lol
