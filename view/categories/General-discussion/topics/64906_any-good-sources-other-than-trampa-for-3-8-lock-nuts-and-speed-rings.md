you'd have to look. Go to either a local hardware store or a fasteners specialist

3/8 locknuts are pretty easy to come by. Hardware store, online, etc.

But those speed rings :confounded:. For whatever reason my Trampa didn't come with any. Couldn't find anything that came close, ended up using a 3/8th drill bit to drill out the inside diameter of existing washers and a dremel to grind down the outside diameter.
