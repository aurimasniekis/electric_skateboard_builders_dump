I'm actually trying to do something slightly different. My 96-year old Dad came across a video of a motorized walker (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FSWf8vG0kI&t=18s3 at around 1:34) - and started jonesing for one. I figure I'll build him one.

In essence, the idea is to build something that's not that different from an electric board, except:
- shorter & wider - with handles (or attached to an existing walker frame)
- slow, probably single speed (1-2 mph) 

I'm thinking that the simplest design is to start with a piece of wood, and attach:
- unpowered wheels or casters on the corners
- a drive unit - ideally a one-piece truck/motor/wheels/battery unit - I'm thinking a hub motor on each wheel to allow steering by applying differential power

It's pretty clear that a drivetrain designed for variable speed, 0-20mph isn't quite the right fit.  I'm wondering if anybody might have some comments on the general design approach, and suggestions as to specific components that might be appropriate.

Now, if anybody knows a builder in the Phoenix AZ, or Boston, MA area - that would also be cool.  I'm not proud - I'd just as soon work with someone who knows what's available in the way of parts, and has all the necessary tools close at hand.

I think this is the place to start!  hoverboards are cheaper and only go about 5-6 mph....

@mfidelman1 Love the idea!

I would rather suggest something that looks like a trike instead. I think it will be hard to steer something that has two wheel front drive. You would also omit the hassle with a differential drive. 

I think the concept of for example @Pylonflyer's drift trike would be something to look into, without the plastic tubes on the back wheels of course and a stand-up-model instead of sitting near the ground.
Basic layout would be a big front wheel  and two smaller back wheels on a long baseplate for stability.

Here's the thread on drift trikes:

Why not make him a model where he can sit down? 
I would recommend to buy some hover board hub motors. You can find them on eBay as new spare parts really cheap! They have a reasonable amount of tourque and a low top speed.

You could also make him a seg way style model, but with four wheels so he does not have to balance.

There are lots of sit-down scooters on the market.  He really wants to stand up.  Thanks, though.

Use a brushed motor. They can go super slow with lots of torque. They are also super easy to wire, u can just use a potentiometer for speed control

Ahh... now that's a concrete suggestion I can use.  Any thoughts on specific vendors?

And... I was just thinking about stepper motors - another option for high torque, at low speeds.  Thoughts?

someone I know made this and I think it's super cool.  not slow at 27mph and far from legal probably anywhere but relatively cheap compared to a car!   I know not what you were thinking but I think the design is worth looking at for ideas

This is what inspired the idea.  This one uses a Rascal scooter drive train, powering the front wheels.  I was thinking of a powered skateboard truck under the platform the rider stands on.

Just lean. Skate trucks for turning.

A quick update.  My Dad ended up in the hospital for a while - which put the project on the back burner.  I did put together a really quick & dirty proof-of-concept prototype.  

Essentially, I cobbled together a wheeled platform, a Swagtron e-scooter (single, 6" hub motor + battery & electronics), and a standard walker.  See the photo for what the thing looks like.  (See photo.)

Basic conclusion - it can haul me (230 lbs) at 2-3 miles an hour, with lots of drag in the mechanics; so... the basic concept is sound.  Now, it's time to start working with individual components and build something more solid.
