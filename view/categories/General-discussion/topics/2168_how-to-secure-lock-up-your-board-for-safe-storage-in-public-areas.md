What do you guys do with your boards if you can't bring them into a certain place? I have skateboard locking racks around campus but might be too thick. Are there any good ways to lock it to a bike rack or something?

I won't even bother locking them unattended. Put it in a big and just bring it along.

I was concerned about this too
This was the best thing I could find
Won't deter someone with tools but prevents any casual passers by form walking off with it

Leaving normal board is fine, but not 1k++ eboard.
Even if the person doesn't determine or can't steal it, they can just break it into pieces or might as well steal them in pieces leaving you with a plain board and nothing else.

Same here, just knowing it's in my locked car makes me cringe. That cable honestly would do nothing. It looks so easy to steal still. There is no way to lock a skateboard up. However, the beauty of a skateboard is that you can bring them almost anywheres. I've personally never had any issue. The only possible way to lock them would be in a large enough locker.

This sounds like the perfect situation for that board that folds in half and goes in a backpack. 

Someone should hack a DIY board and make a sexy two piece out of it.

Like the others mentioned I take it with me. If carrying it isn't feasible, you can get a grab handle. Sometimes I just drag it by the front truck behind me. I've been looking into skate packs that can hold it, for times when I need to walk longer or want my hands to be free. If i know the folks at the store (my local hardware store sees me every week at least) they might let me stash it behind a counter. 

Like @laurnts said, not leaving an expensive PEV outside to be messed with!

Has anyone tried to lock his board using the ''hole'' for the handle?

Seems better than just attach a chain around the trucks..

As someone would either have to break the board or cut the lock / chain to get the board.. unscrewing the truck screws does not seem to be a very hard task for someone determined to get at least something out of your precious gem..

----

I have thought about electronic motion alarm, let's say if someone moves the board, the alarm goes off. Although I have not searched  for any available products in this category yet. 

Alarm might solve the situation, where someone would spot your expensive battery pack or your motor and would try to dismantle it. Otherwise not entirely sure what good way there is, to secure the components, so someone who finds them attractive would not try to take them away.

Just wire up a remote switch that will connect two shorted wires in the lipo battery. When you come out and find your board has been stolen, send the signal to start the fireworks. Kind of like exploding ink packs when you rob a bank. That'll show 'em. :laughing: 

Man, I hate thieves.

@Nordle  Well, that might be also be an idea for outdoor locking.. just cover it, so not everyone has a clue what exactly that is.. although, not sure how well this might work :slight_frown:

@Mobutusan then it should be designed not to damage other components! In case you do recover your board afterwards! Someone should measure how much time it takes before it goes off! :smiley: 

When I read on this forum that some bastard stole a board from locked car parked in a closed parking lot or similar, then I started to take this matter more seriously.

I have been working on a design that would make an easy way to attach to backpack similar to this only instead it would attach at a hanger by the trucks, idk about using velcro, no wonder the kickstarter failed.....

God I hate the awkwardness of trying to walk around or hold stuff with an esk8 in hand.

Here is a rough sketch of what I am imagining....
https://i.imgur.com/GdPfNdl.png

Problems include:
1. Bottom half of board swinging
2. board length may hit your butt, or awkwardly hit leg when running
3. secure way to semi-permanently keep device on backpack

I see dirty butts unless there is a sleeve ... But yes the swaying would be no Bueno ...also hitting the back of the legs .... 

Turned around would be the only viable solution to avoid the above

What material would you use for that strapped mount? 

Im thinking it should be something stiff. 

Some laptop / camping bags has ''hard'' back surface.
 I would imagine that it needs to be sturdy, so the board's weight does not lie entirely on the backpack. Ideally, the back should have a ''frame'' structure. One ''mount'' / support point for top of the backpack and one for bottom. 

Otherwise the board is just lying on your backpack / on your own back and pushing its weight against you

I Imagine something like this:

As there's metal already, you wouldnt need to modify it that much. Covering the bare metal would be a great idea to make it nicer looking, so it does not look like you are from army.

This, of course, is custom / diy solution but it seems people here are creative enough to make everything ranging from remotes to enclosures.

That's what I meant, just an extra hole for locking up your board! Outside edges perhaps can be made from metal, so that there's extra protection if someone tries to cut the board.

If it's inside enclosure, a lock might be the answer.. :D Im doubting that someone would try and have all the tools at hand, if you were just leaving your board for 30min outside of mall with a lot of ppl passing by. 

Though, it is hard to predict such circumstances and every place / corner / situation will be different.

That's why, I think,  place is important, so I wouldnt leave a board in a shady corner 500m away from people unless it is hidden / covered,  so nobody can know there is an unattended board..

---
Somone probably should come up with some sort of most used thief techniques and how to avoid them to predict various scenarios and how to overcome them.. 

Carrying a board, especially if it is a mountainboard, is not always that handy / comfortable. Not sure if a lot of people carry their mountainboards along with them...

----

The most tricky part, in my opinion, is to secure the motor. Unless there is some form of enclosure / box for it, it is quite open / available :frowning: 

Have not seen many diy enclosures for totally hidden motor and belt. It seems only commerical eboard makers tend to make these.

I used to stash my board in the bushes outside my school, because I hate carrying it around all day but my school just recently put these lockable skateboard racks in for us. Pretty cool idea because I can actually lock it in with a lock and not worry. I think the company that makes them is ground control systems. Hope this helps.

There is a review video below the product description, that shows how you can easily open the loop by wiggling it around. So not safe at all.

I may have found a possible solution: You need two locks, and with at least one of them you need to be able to adjust the length of the cable, so you can wrap it tightly around the trucks of your drive, then you use the other lock/loop cable to go around the first lock and the pole or bike rack, you are attaching it to.

But yeah be careful, wouldn't leave it for more than a few hours there. Certainly not overnight. I read somewhere, that the value of the lock should be a tenth the value of the bike, so these thin cables, wouldn't offer adequate protection for such an expensive board.

In any case, here are some tips for secure bike locking from kryptonite, but I am sure they can apply for Esk8es too:

1. CHOOSE THE RIGHT LOCK. The level of security you need depends on where you are leaving your bike, and for how long.
2. ALWAYS LOCK YOUR BIKE to a solid object that it cannot be lifted over.
3. LOCK YOUR BIKE in a well lit area with high foot traffic.
4. MAKE SURE what you lock your bike to cannot be cut.
5. LOCK ACCORDING TO VALUE frame first, then back wheel, and finally front wheel.
6. GET A TIGHT FIT! The less room inside of the u-lock or chain, the more difficult it will be for thieves to use their tools.
7. POSITION YOUR LOCK off the ground with the keyhole facing down.
```

I had an interesting idea for like a security bag you can put you stuff in (would come in multiple sizes for bikes-skateboards-etc. Zip object into bag-lock to poles and racks.

It would be a tough Kevlar and wire reinforced bag with sensors to detect Being cut open, extremely loud alarm. what I think would be most reassuring to have would be a cellular link to the bad so if it senses movement or disturbance the bag could call your phone and you could yell at whoever is touching your stuff I'm on my way or whatever. Maybe a hidden Integrated üì∑.

When the alarm goes off first thing it says is YOU ARE ON CAMERA STEP AWAY.
