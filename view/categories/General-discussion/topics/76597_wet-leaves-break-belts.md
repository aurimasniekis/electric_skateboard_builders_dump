Just broken 2 belts at the same moment having ridden through a woodland.... 

The leaves built up in the grooves of my pullies till the belts snapped.. I know @b264 had a similar issue with ice... 

No board fun this weekend now. üôÅ

4 belts broken, snapped in half, from snow building up on the pulley making it bigger around and tightening the belt until it breaks.  Need someone like @torqueboards or @Boardnamics to innovate a mount with a spring-tensioned motor   :smiley: or just use chains or axial direct drive for a winter board

Yeah, I ride hubs from my first day Eskating, but i would prefer chains instead of belts if i would ride outrunner motors.
I totally like the sound of chains, too hahahaha
I my opinion chains are much more solid and reliable then belts, but i never experienced that by myself, its just what i think.

Just seal that belt up? I suppose any drive train would benefit from being enclosed in these conditions?

Would some sort of belt cover prevent this? I'm just thinking about what I could do to my board once its running.

There were belt covers

Snow goes in the same hole the belt goes in

If you were going to cover the belt assembly enough to keep all snow out, you might as well put gears inside at that point.

I was just about to ask that, wouldn't it be a waste of time and you should just go gears then!

I want to try gears out, but I need to get my first build done so I can see what a decent belt driven system feels like. My only reference is my wife's boosted XR+.

Correction. He's a weird looking **Skunk**. Looks a lot like one of those pesky humans. I always thought @Skunk was one of our ultra minority, Animal American forum members. There are so few these days. Just destroyed my illusion of him chasing around lady skunks trying to be charming, but really just stalking and harassing them. Basically, the American stoner version of this persistently creepy weirdo. ![_SX425_|425x347](upload://sUkqHgymku0VLEgrNztoPw4Lnzu.jpeg)

Wait Wait Wait...I thought a bunch of you guys insisted belts were stretchy? Or was it that they dissolved in water? I can't remember..

Beer, they dissolve in beer.
Ask @akhlut and @sender what happens when they spill theirs over the pulleys.

Of course it does. Spilling good beer is a completely valid reason for a grown man to burst into tears.
I know I would if I spilled my Paulaner Weiss

I'm right there with you.  I have a a significant amount of beer on hand and I'm trying to behave.

The struggle is most definitely real.

And this stuff is tasty.

If you can get WeissBier in the US try it.
You may or may not like it but it is definitely one of the things you have to try.

And if you've never tried carlsburg lager. It tastes like a swampy lake smells. Weird but I like it.

I ride through leaves all the time with belts and never had an issue.  Of course snow usually isn't an issue either, just certain snow seems to do it.  It has to be a certain stickiness.  Not too wet or too dry.  I imagine it's similar with leaves.... certain leaves with a certain moisture level in a certain situation.

It's amazing how many different ways there are to break an esk8.
