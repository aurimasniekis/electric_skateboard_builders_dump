Just curious to see how the people ride with what hand holding their remote. Poll because they're fun and easy to condense answers.

[poll type=multiple min=1 max=4 public=true]
* Right hand remote regular
* Right hand remote goofy
* Left hand remote regular
* Left hand remote goofy
[/poll]

Really interested in who is left handed or right handed and does that affect the way they choose to ride

I ride with right foot forward, with remote on the left hand. It's all by preference, but i found it to be better to have your remote on the opposite side of your foot placement so in a scenario where you fall, the side where you will usually fall to is the side without the remote, so your other free hand can break the fall etc.

I was riding (until I started rebuilding it) a cheapish maxfind board and the remote would drop out constantly.  No big deal, it starts coasting, just pump the throttle to get it working again. Wasn't disconnecting to the point of needing re-paired but annoying.  Realized one day the I was holding the remote in my right hand behind my back right next to the iphone in my back pocket.  Switched to the left hand and most of the dropouts went away.  It ended up working better because it frees up my dominant hand.  Downside is since I ride regular, if I fall forward, I'm probably going to mash the remote between my hand and the street.

Yah, my remote tends to get scratched up pretty good since it ends up being used as a slide puck.

I just switched to keeping my phone in my front pocket ‚Äì I'm right handed (ride regular), so prefer the remote in my right hand, so with my phone in my left pocket, I can take it out with my left hand to check the time and texts while waiting at stop-lights. I'm using a brick-phone, so I'd rather that breaks in a fall than my nano-X remote :P

I tried riding with the remote in my left hand it's hard. To me it's similar to braking with your left foot in a car, if your not used to it you will need alot of practice before you can do it effectively.

I wakeboard both, snowboard both, skate both but more comfortable goofy.  Only esk8 goofy.  All to do with the power being below you not generated by pushing or gravity which causes weight transference that I just can't get the hang of regular.  You should see me coming out of a slide all wobbly and shit.  Usually ends in tears.

Someone should make a poll about riding style, ie: straight line riding or carving
But I ride right hand regular all the way

This is why I want someone to make endless ride happen. I'd love a mini cruiser with that feature to push around and my aging bod would be able to keep up.

It would be cool to make a gear drive with the motor mound being adjustable so if you wanted to push the board you could slide the motor away from the wheel disengaging the gears.

Heres an idea.  When you reach level three trust then you get the option to choose either regular or goofy as your title.  No hang on then I would have goofy up there.  No scrap that.
@brenternet your nipples would have definitely detached after my spectacular forward somersault after forgetting to engage reverse after a perfect 180 slide.
@Jake2k17 a clutch then?

Somewhat...I'm not very good at explaining but you know the grooves in the motor mounts so that you can slide the motor back and forth to adjust belt tension, use that for a gear drive so you could easily slide the motor away from the gear to make it like a 20 lb pushboard

You'd have some serious meshing issues with gear drive I reckon.  I'm too old for pushing now anyway lol
If my board shits out I'm in an uber.

Yeah I guess if you did that it would be easy for rocks and stuff to get in your gear drive. 
Also, my little siblings and cousins like to use pushboards, and when my little cousin asks to ride my board I use some out of context Enertion on them, "Your to short to push"
