I'm a really big fan of these motor mounts and the method they use for covering electronics... Genius.  I have a puck remote in the way, I have high hopes for it as well. 

This is really the only prebuilt thane board I would consider.

I'll post more pictures later today after our 2nd day with the Hoyt St. peeps and the BAEsk8 Group ride to Twin Peaks, San Fran's highest accesible elevation (925' feet). This will be a nice test for their boards and really see how they perform.

waiting on @sofu's review; optimistic that this Hoyt (or something built with Hoyt St. batteries at a minimum) will solve my international travel challenges.

![psmtmls|666x500](upload://rhgfcNOYOtqxG7fiEQTJHOEblYW.jpeg) 

We didn't esk8 in Barcelona or Dubai this year because it's too hard to fly even with "approved" batteries (means nothing, it's always up to the captain).

Exploratorium (Pier 15) 1:00 pm... but we just took off! 

...they will stop at this place "Flywheel" which I think is a Cafe over the Presidio, recharge and then to Twin Peaks. You can catch them there on the way up.

This afternoon we gather at the Exploratorium in San Francisco for the weekly Bay Area Esk8 Group ride and got the chance to take a few more images of the Hoyt St boards.

@pixelsilva

I made it! I had an amazing time. It was good to meet everyone and put faces to esk8 aliases. It was a big group ride today. So many cool boards Kalys, La Croix, Raptor, Hoyt, DIY boards. Also, One wheels, unicycles, boosted, halo etc. my 12s4p TB battery pack got tested and was able to stick around the whole time without bringing a charger.
 
The Hoyt board is just as nice in real person. I am really impressed with the battery modules and with @Jonner  downhill form and Coleman slide in the middle of the street. Savage.

Got a chance to try the Hoyt St today. It's vesc4.x based with dual high quality motors made in the states. Kelvar reinforced stator with Japanese bearing. I heard the motors cost more than $300 each and min order quantity of 1000.

From the 5 mins I rided it. Here's what I feel:
Pros:
* Pretty good acceleration and top speed. 
* The full bamboo deck is on the stiff side but with the 90mm wheels and 1/4" riser it's really comfortable 
* 180mm trucks can really carve, and quite comfortable too.  

Cons:
* I would really prefer a wider truck tho. It was a bit wobbly at high speed but it could also just be the bushing 
* Brake was a bit lack imo. It took some distance to a full stop. (PS I'm riding hummies, so I've quite the high standard lol)
* Bldc not foc. You already know the difference.

Overall it is a great deck. The quality of construction is really well built. A lot of very cool and innovative designs. Double deck, pulley cover, string loaded tensioner, etc.

How o the batteries work?

Do 3 of them connect in parallel? and make one big battery?

or you use them one at a time?

A video would be nice.

Yeah, the wood enclosure is conformal. They created that enclosure with a wood bending technique, probably vacuum formed or steam. Really light, thin, but stiff, like a wooden shell. The battery modules are built around some sort of quality plastic each and come with a set of lights. You attach them to the board thru this male pin connector that lays there on the underbelly (you can see the connector over the missing battery module empty space, below where the puck remote is)‚Ä¶

To clarify, the battery modules are CNC'd aluminum housing and each contains its own BMS. If the batteries ever get out of balance you can plug them individually into the rail system and charge them separately. Each battery is 10s1p 25R. They're looking at 30q units for people who don't fly much. 

Lots of other information I have from my discussions with them. I'll write it up when I get back home!

Ok so there are a few things I can't disclose publicly, so I'll do my best with what I can disclose.

Regarding the motors, I can't disclose their supplier, but they're based in the US, have been making super high quality motors since forever (just not for eskate, until now). From personal testing and research knowing the supplier, I can say that if the motors they're making for Hoyt St. continue their usual quality, then they are likely one of the highest quality motors you can get for eskate right now, which is a bold claim to be sure. They sure are expensive, and of course much much more testing should be done and at least one of them should be sacrificed for a scientific teardown, but they're very nice so far. BTW the previous $300 claim is from when @Aeroquiv and I were discussing how much they might cost, and is not legitimate info from Hoyt. They likely cost upwards of $200 though

As an aside, I tested my set, and they tested 176kv. only 4kv off their 180kv claim. They are supposed to be able to handle around 150A *continuous* when extrapolating from the supplier's data on their other motors. As an anecdotal benchmark, these Hoyt 5653s feel twice as strong as my SK8 6354. 

Like I said before, each 10s1p is enclosed in an aluminum case containing an independent bms and voltmeter. They have two recessed female contacts that you press onto two exposed male contacts on the power rail for each battery. It's a really elegant system. They're 25Rs, and you can balance charge each parallel individually.

![IMG_3757|666x500](upload://mWb7Ed5Eoe8zsfshWuPBn5I33Yc.jpeg) 

They're running vesc 4.12s on BLDC. It seems to be standard vesc hardware, but they moved the positioning of the shunts to the side vs. the old position on the top. No otherwise upgraded components. They went for reliability which is why they chose BLDC. The settings on their demo boards were quite low, which is why we advised them to turn them up for the highest speed mode, especially braking power. I'm told by Hoyt that their supplier is a "high quality esc supplier". They would not disclose their vesc supplier to me. 

Here's a pic where you can clearly see their antispark
![IMG_3758|666x500](upload://mNrv2DBQlTacHexqyrgTQ4YvPmq.jpeg) 

As for the remote, in my opinion the ergonomics are not that big of a deal. I have small hands and besides it being a bit fat like an ice cream sandwich, I like it.

Yo, do those motors makers would consider making motors for DIY guys too? I am curious how they would hold abuse with high currents and heat...

Also I am bit curious who is making 3 phase brushless permanent magnet motors that size outside China because so far I haven't found anyone making hobby size motors apart big size motors.

Afaik Hoyt only got the deal because Edwin is a close friend of somebody high up at the supplier. We've certainly been talking about running a group buy for these motors and have asked Hoyt to put in a good word for us, but the MOQ is 1000 and the motors are expensive, which means at least $200k upfront cost if we wanted to group buy... A tall order for as of yet largely untested motors...

BTW I edited my OP to include the continuous current it's supposed to handle. I'm not too sure on the figure because it's extrapolated from the supplier's other data; somebody needs to fully test it :P

At latest findings we figured out that epoxy temp doesn't really much affect anything its elasticity which is important because when motor can (bell) expands from heat if epoxy is not elastic it will brake its bonds

Also after looking into their website they seems to use same charger I use (generic one) and it has voltage switch 120V->240V but internally it does nothing I will upload pictures later when I am going to swap fan with noctua one in mine :)

Also does those battery packs has vent hole? Because if its air tight and cells goes venting it will be practically a nice bomb under you are deck :)

Great looking board with some dope quality parts, I got a chance to test ride it  and the performance just wasn‚Äôt enough for SF riding,. seems like they were having a few issues and the range was lacking comparing It to a Boosted, they weren‚Äôt getting that 22miles range they claim or at least 15miles range  it seem more like 7-8 miles.. Once they fix all the bugs  and hopefully make a 10s4p or bigger now we are talking and il Buy one quick üëçüèº

[/quote]

Tried to read everything you wrote (thank you for that). Do you know if they would make a single large pack, I would think having 30 cells and one BMS in one enclosure would make more sense to those who don't travel with boards. Personally I like the option of a larger battery, with another in the backpack and just buy one small 10s1p for travel

Oh also, "women get in the kitchen where you belong!" :wink::joy:
