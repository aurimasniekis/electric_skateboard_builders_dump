Do you guys think it would be possible to make your own ![maxresdefault|690x388](upload://xmjkOExSSCgBfUhJx7dPOI0G5UL.jpg)Super 73 electric bike/scooter?

Sure it's possible but that frame design is just ...

It's terribly weak.  It needs to be two triangles and not a quadrilateral...

I looked into this a bit ago.  Gave up once it got even a little hard.

Dude just get a real moped. A tomos with an a35 or a50 with a pipe and jetted carb will easily hit 40mph and go forever on a gallon of premix. Or if you really want to up the small bike game ante yiu could get an mb5 and have a TON of fun on a 50cc 5 speed bike.

Finally I opened a similar topic couple months ago since then I have done butt loads of researching I think I know pretty much how to build it it’s just lack of money.

Frame you can buy almost replica of the 73 model not the scouts which imo look better. On alibaba anyways

Use a more powerful middruve like a Bbshd or bbs02 instead of their hub. They used middrives on V1 

Battery stuff we are good at on the forum.

So only thing is if you want to implement the vesc instead of an traditional ebike controller. It’s has been done and there are easy ways to convert the ebike thottle to vesc etc

I dont really like that frame design either. Not only from rigidity but also styling points of veiw. Its just missing something .. the open area between the top tubes and the battery is such an eyesore

I can also agree on that the emptiness in the middle is strange especially when using a hub motor

But goddamn it’s cool af

I'm using one of these for my next build dual 63xx motors (haven't decided the kv yet) on TB 218 trucks 6 inch shooter tires with trampa superstar hubs dual FocBox 10s5p lg hg2 or dual lipo 5s pack. But for now it's just on paper I only have the board and trucks

Somebody should have told Norton that when they won all those Manx TT trophys back in the 50s....but ok the headstock is not braced, then again we are talking about a moped

...dammit I've just retorted on a two year old conversation

not a quadrilateral

I was thinking of doing this with an old Honda Ruckus. But once you get into the the really highvoltage it's another ball game and hardware is much more expensive.

Price is with everything but you can buy frame only and then put your own parts into it

My base idea is to use the frame and a mid drive from them and exchange to a focbox and my own battery and put it under the seat. Change to a twist throttle and hydraulic brakes instead

I see the pre-made version of this bike around. Bit expensive seeming unless u built it yourself.   I like the look of it and was looking into costs months ago. I’d likely get a frame too, maybe we could split shipping.  Or maybe it’s worth getting a complete from them. 

This could be made cooler looking.  Will be doing the same
