I have been swirling this idea around in my head for an all wood deck that has a similar built in enclosure like the carbon fiber decks. In order for the board to be sleek I need a opening through the entire deck, but this of course would reduce the strength when weight is applied. 

In order to compensate, an aluminum or carbon fiber stabilizer would be put on the bottom of the board around the opening. The top portion could be made from bamboo for extra strength. The extended enclosure is a separate section that is bolted on after the support and extends to the edges of the board for a sleek and seamless profile.

Here are some of my concept models:

**Exploded Top Deck**

Why not cnc that shape instead of doing the two part thing?
You could mill the whole deck with the chamber and then put a cover on top of it. Has been done a few times before i think. Same concept as a raptor 1 deck.

Then it´s really important for comfort to put a concave in decks. Totally flat boards are really hard to ride.

I couldn't think of a good way to get the bottom metal support in between the enclosure and the board.

Good Point, ill make some modifications to the model.

Tip: Put the access panel on the bottom of the board and not on the top.  
  
When it's on the top, it's extremely difficult to waterproof and even a tiny amount of damp sand will get water straight onto the ESC circuit board.

Is this something you plan to sell? if so, just make sure you make it big enough to fit a 10s4p or even 12s4p pack along with the other electronics. My biggest issue is size restriction with built in enclosures.

That's exactly why I suggest putting it on the bottom.  Because a rubber gasket will work fine.  99.99% of the time.  Then when water seeps through it your board gets fried.  If the access panel is on the bottom, any water that might seep through has to go uphill and naturally will then try to escape the enclosure.  Instead of try to tunnel deeper until it finds ESC board.

Don't get a flat deck without flex people.
It's boring and vibrations will kill your feet after a short ride. 

For reference I built a similar board with enclosure:

This is not hypothetical.  This is coming from someone who had an esc fry, because the access panel was on top of the board with a rubber seal.  I walked the board across a hazard, and when I got back on I had a little wet sand on my shoes.  Not dripping wet and not a bunch.  But it seeped through the gasket right onto the esc.  Lights out.  It's better to design it in a way where if the seal was breached, water is naturally trying to escape with the help of gravity.  So all access panels on the bottom and rear

I enjoyed your post about your similar build. Although I agree with you about the flex deck I'm willing to sacrifice some vibrations for a really sleek design. Based on your experience riding your all wood deck, were there any additional options to reduce vibrations to a tolerable amount?

> How many cells will that hold with 2 vescs?

I based the measurements off of the TB 12S2P 18650 Battery Pack (335mm Length * 140mm Width * 22mm Height)

12S would be a very tight fit, I think a 10S would fit much better with some room to breathe. 

> What about 107mm wheels?

The Honey DFR I based my pattern on had some sweet cut outs in the wheel sections. I think if I added those and some risers it would accommodate 107mm wheels. Ill add the concave, trucks/wheels, and bottom panel on the next round.

I found it to be so unenjoyable that I took all parts and built a different board with them. The deck is now just sitting in my basement to remind me not do the same mistake again. With pneumatics it might be ok but then you still have the flat shape which just doesn't feel too good. It was an interesting project though.

They use massive and soft wheels - that helps.

If you don’t mind me asking, in your experience pressing decks, is there a limitation to the number of plys you could laminate while still being able to transfer the shape of the mold to your deck?

I was wondering if lamination of like 20 or 30 plys of maple and a few plys of carbon fiber then carving the compartment  from the top and the profile of the bottom, would the deck be strong enough.

highest i've gone is 11 with my current mold. I'd like to try going higher to see what happens. 22 ply would be plenty to pack in a flat 18650 pack and twin vescs under a lid. Call it 24 for a margin.

.stl would be fine 
I was wondering what was your tought on the build process. 
Build the hole board an cut in the middle. Then build a wooden enclosure and an aluminium frame ? 
I wonder how to keep some fine curves, like the integrated deck of the raptor 1 tho achieve what you do with CF with wood is complicated
In your design have you tought of integrated cable managment it could be a cool feature to add. With hubs and this design of yours it would be one of a stealthy beast. 
Compared to the others i think the top opening is the best idea. All the switches and ports will be under the board so there will not be any water issue on the top since you can easily seal it an close the top.

Yeah but IMO in his design once you close the top there’s no holes or whatever you can place a waterproof griptape and the job is done. All the holes will be under the board in his design. Personally i don’t see much risks.

Yea I would purchase the Honey DFR board, cut the opening, make the router section on top and bottom for the top deck to be flush, cut an aluminum bracket or wrap something in carbon fiber for the bottom strength bracket. 

The enclosure could be done a few ways. The first is to make a mold (3d print or foam) and make layers like a skateboard and then CNC or just CNC straight from a solid piece of wood. Some attachments would be make to the board that secure the enclosure for a tight fit.

For cable management I assume your talking about @longhairedboy and how he adds bullet connecters to the bottom and makes routes for the wires on the top of the board to the enclosure. I like this approach, but for this design I have the 4 small holes in the rear of the enclosure, one for power switch, one for charging connecter, and 2 for motor wires.

Modeling the definition of insanity?

I put my switches, guages, and charge ports on the sides and bottom. Nothing goes on top. That's where your feet go. And crazy fucked up artwork. and mud and water. 

shit on the bottom gets banged up but doesn't present major fluid ingress risks. Charge port can go there because mine have swinging lids that can take a direct hit from a rock and use XLR connectors which physically distance and sheild the power leads from acute dirty moisture continuity. 

Fule guages get too fucked up down there, but almost nothing ever strikes the side of the box. The wheel spray passes right by it and nothing hits it. Seal around it and moisture ingress is a non issue. 

The rocker switches are the same. They can take a hit but don't have to. moisture ingress can theoretically happen within the switch but can't get past it, and to date has not  been an issue. They have simple parts and are less prone to vibrational switching mechanism damage than the push buttons which are hit or miss. I have some that fail immediately and one that's been on Ru for 2 years. But switches can't be on the bottom or they'll get hit, and the top is no place for them either.
