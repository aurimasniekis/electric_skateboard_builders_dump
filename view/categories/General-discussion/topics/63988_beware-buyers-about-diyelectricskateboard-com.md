Here products/torqueboards-2-4ghz-mini-remote-controller they sell their remote for $77.95 CAD which is not what the item is worth as you can see here https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B073GX83NH/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o05_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 . Now I'm not saying they are ripping people off but I just wanted to let my fellow Esk8ters to know about this so you can save money because not all of us have enough money to just toss around for some people that made a shopify store and grabbed the pricing out of their ass. and there are some other items on their site that the pricing seems off so beware do the research before you buy from them. And to be clear not all of their stuff is overpriced some are very reasonable but again some are way too much and seems to be source from somewhere else.
