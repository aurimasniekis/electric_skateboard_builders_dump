this is the invoice they sent me. if there are only two people, we are going to split the paypal and shipping fee in half, if we got more people order, maybe I can bargain for a wholesale price and we got more people to split the shipping and paypal fee.

OMG that is unbelievable, is it because yours are customized and mines are factory setting? because my sales representative never asked me to set anything lol. I feel like i will be the sales representative of this forum in the future when handling Chinese factory orders lollll

```
They should have sent you a parameter sheet and it's up to you to request any changes.
The default setting for over discharge is 2.8v per cell which is ok for Li-ions but not for Lipos.

The difference in price could reflect a change in money conversion.
I haven't ordered any recently.

@TunaTee, I am interested in a 10s BMS as well. Is there anyway I can get in on this as well? I am in California if that helps.  As @Namasaki said though, I was hoping that I could get one configured for a LiPo setup. 

Let me know what I need to do.

Thanks!

The two I bought the other day with 3v overcharge protection were charged at $39 dollars too.
I don't speak Chinese either. Looks like the price has dropped.

Those bms's are a bargain at $49
At $39 it's a steal!
The built in E-switch alone is worth the price so it's like your getting the bms for free!!

You are aware that the 10s bms will not work for 9s correct?

The representative just replied me that i can use 9s lipo on 10s bms. however, they recommend to use a 9s bms. I will ask them if i can order 1 9s and 1 10s :D

## \#19 Posted by: Namasaki Posted at: 2017-09-27T22:05:02.876Z Reads: 98

I would not trust that representative. They are sales personal not engineers.
The 10s bms will not work with a 9s battery because it will sense incorrect voltage from balance pin 10 and will go into protection shut down as soon as you turn in on.
```

Okay, thanks for your clarification. 
I will get a 9S. But I really like your implementation on that 5 pack 2s lipos though. Should I just a 9s and a 10s for future? lol
```

---
## \#21 Posted by: Namasaki Posted at: 2017-09-27T22:10:03.309Z Reads: 93

```
You would be better off just doing a 10s with a combination of five 2s or two 5s packs

42v chargers are more common and it is easier to sell a 10s bms than a 9s

10s is pretty much the sweet spot goto voltage for street boards

12s for mountain boards

Five of these batteries would really rock the house!

I am sure those will rock!
But it kinda exceeds my budget. I built my board about 800, so I will probably spend about 100 to upgrade it at this time? I am certain that i will gradually upgrade it to a beast lol.

These are a more budget minded and still perform very well with minimum voltage sag.
Good for medium range 12 miles
I've been using them on my boards for over a year and there holding up very well.

Good thing I am in NYC too. You can email me your preferred configuration to my personal email tom960105@hotmail.com. I will talk to the sales representative. Also, I will ask him if I can make some Chinese domestic bank transfer which should allow us to save that Paypal fee.

I’m tired of wrestling large bms into my setup. I’m going to try out a charge only setup and let the vesc handle cut off. This has worked for me many times before I started using a bms.

Also no e switch with that Banggood one!

you can  easily check if it works well and also there are many maybe even better than this one that isn't bestech and probably cheaper, do you care to explain whats an e switch?

Just because they all come from China doesnt mean they are all the same quality. @Acido antispark switch costs money so you're  better off buying a bms with the switch for a nice clean look vs antispark xt90s imo. Its just not worth it in my opinion to skimp out on a cheap bms. Plus 45 amps isnt enough max discharge for me. Now if you wanted to get a cheap bms to charge only for your batteries go for it.

paired with a vedder switch its a treat but you are entitled to your opinion, i have the besteh 80a bms for discharge yet have noticed no diffenrece between my cell voltage or anything else in my batteries with the exception of the bms size
