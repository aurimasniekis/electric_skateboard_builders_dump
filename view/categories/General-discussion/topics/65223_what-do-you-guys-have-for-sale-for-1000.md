With a total budget of $1000, can anyone out there build me a custom board? What kind of specs could I see in it?

Thank you

  a bit of diy will go a long way for keeping the price down and without a compromise in performance

you like duct tape!?  ive had a duct tape and glue board holding it all together from day one...but moving up soon.  for 1000 you can get lipos and a balance discharger and some vescs and youre killing it at that point already.

Had a board where I ran out of duct tape after one wrap around my board. Wrapped the rest with electrical tape and blue tape. I support it.

ok i have to say lipo and tape dont go well together for longevity.  a disaster.  but...a bit of fiberglass or carbon and resin on top of those cells and maybe better than a fancy bolt on box.  youre really sinking lower than me even it sounds.  but maybe in performance you probably rock!!

i can see johnny waiting in the wings i think ready to remind me!!!

Try gaffer tape. I have a roll at home and at work, and a bunch on my board :) Helps me get home when little bits fall off.

Is this an actual proposition or are you just curious to see if we want to do an "iron chef" of skateboard building and get ideas?

I have spare electronics I can put together for $1k. If you want a good deck and enclosure, youâ€™d have to pay extra for that.

buy someones custom board
[/quote]

besides $1,000 USD what else are you looking for? what kind of terrain do you ride in? How fast do you ride comfortably? what kind of range and how much do you weight?

when you say custom? what are you referring to really? a paint job? just DIY or a DIY with your requirements?

U.s. kits

$500 to 800 depending on wheels (urethane vs all terrain)
******************************************************

So heres the dealeo, 
1k is possible, but you are going to be limited I think to non allterrain unless you buy a Chinese diyeboards AT kit.

Also battery size is going to be limited because, well batteries are expensive to have them premade. 

I may have missed some of the vendors on here but overall you can see most VESC builds with reputable vendor parts will always cost over 1k and even most boards sold here will be over 1k unless it's a single belt and smaller battery pack.

I think the lowest awesome board I saw was a raptor 1 and that thing was priced like $1200 I think... @Mikenopolis weren't you selling that one?
 
Hopefully you find what you need. :slight_smile:

What I sold was a CarvOn V4 built in a Raptor 1 deck for just $1000 battery was on the older side so about 10 mile range. No escs though so roughly $1,200 to get it running

liquid polyurethane, epoxy and carbon fiber for covering batteries and gluing everything down                                         50



arguably the best board you'll make for 1100$

but you could surely do a pulley setup and make it even cheaper.  shouldnt be hard to get the parts all for under 1000$ and would take minimum soldering and time to get it onto the deck
