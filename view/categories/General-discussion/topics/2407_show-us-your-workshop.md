You can't build an eboard if you don't have a working space.... This thread is dedicated to the MAN CAVES we all spend so much of our time in. Please share your photos OR videos of your space.

here is a video tour of my recently renovated space...

This is weird. I have been thinking about, and planning to start this exact thread for the last couple hours. I was also thinking that the only shop I've seen in any detail was yours, and posting pics of my narrow, barely adequate section of usable garage space would pale in comparison. So, well done! 

Looking forward to seeing where the rest of you mad scientists create your monsters!

We just sold our house and are in the final days before we move to a new house. My shop space is going to shrink, but the new place has some potential for a bigger Vac/form station and a larger oven!<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/9/90f3609bc6f52c895d556987d94472cb649126b0.jpg" width="689" height="390"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/e/e56079cb164defd7dbed486f4a3f8650ce753855.jpg" width="689" height="390"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/b/be02fcc1e66407a4be969fa0b3c8f15ca45b957e.jpg" width="689" height="390"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/e/eb8a9ae95528e1aa49caaa98aaf9b2338df452fa.jpg" width="689" height="390">

My shop is a two car garage, and only one car parks in it. I'm always updating it, but this is my area right now. Just this past weekend i ran a separate circuit for my bench and put a 30amp breaker on it so i could use my spot welder while other shit is on. then i installed a 15amp protected utility strip across the front of my bench. so now i have two separate circuits doing things on my bench. One for charging drill batteries and power drivers and a soldering iron, and one for spot welding and glue guns and heat guns and anything else i want to plug into that strip. 

My press, which is right next to my bench:

(there's a 9 ply Scarlet in there)

and my bench:

https://www.instagram.com/p/BETZD-HBBhJ/?taken-by=longhairedboy

I made these wire dispensers out of metal coffee cans that had rubbery plastic lids. they work really well:
https://www.instagram.com/p/BERj96EhBhc/?taken-by=longhairedboy

and this is where i'm currently setting up VESCs; its my audo workstation but boards also fit on keyboard stands, so there you have it:
https://www.instagram.com/p/BCZZHSahBng/?taken-by=longhairedboy

I'm about to build a second bench and more storage space along with a new rack. There's plenty of floor where my truck used to park:
https://www.instagram.com/p/BCbr3yxBBsS/?taken-by=longhairedboy

and my four board rack is too small now:
https://www.instagram.com/p/BD9X0zLhBgB/

so my new bench area will have a rack on the end of it sort of like @onloop 's setup. I'm probably going to start some of that next weekend. Building an awesome shop is fun. 

Lastly i just moved the lady stereo out into the grage because i think the office is going to get some shelves. Plus it looks amazing out there and thumps cypress hill like a boss:

That's definitely yours. Still waiting on a replacement motor to arrive in the mail. :pensive:

The raptor repairs stole my rack space, so i stole @onloop 's idea for the rack based on one of his shop pics. I always liked his shop. I used wooden dowels and drilled holes for them in the 2x4s then glued them in. The table top is three feet across so plenty of room for gluing veneer and stacking it on the mold, then i just swing it around and drop it in the press. Also way more room for multiple builds and stuff to happen. 

I still need to panel it up and put shelves underneath and stuff and also run a shelf across the top with lighting on the bottom side of it and run another power strip and drop an electrical line for it. I'm probably going to run ethernet out there too because my wifi sucks balls out there. I can barely skype. It's coming together nicely though.

Our mancave as we indeed call it (females are generally encouraged to stay away from this place) consists of two office spaces I rent in a larger building. One is mainly focused on "dirty" mechanical work whilst the other is for the "cleaner"  work.

Room 1:

My bedroom workspace:

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/f/f65a5b84e6973c7f91abd9fa9f0ce3cc388e7682.jpg" width="620" height="500">

Board in it's pride of place, obviously.

If you look closely, a 3D printer is in the works. Should be finished in a week or two. Will be great for prototyping of various things. I'm building a Prusa I3.

Also going to build a nice adjustable 60V 10A bench supply. A nice vice is also on the list.

I have a whole lot of other tools at my parents place out in the country like a router table, table saw and drill press. Don't have a garage in my city flat so this has to do.

The CAD station (also in the bedroom):

The parts where the magic happens aren't shown to protect the privacy of other individual that is currently in them. 

Fortunately it doesn't complain about the bedroom workstation, as I've also installed a make up station. So all is well.

This is what keeps the other half happy:

Everyone's entitled to their fascination.

Reviving this thread, Harbor Freight had these work benches on sale for $75. I had been eyeing them for a while and pulled the trigger. Only thing left to add is a hot air station and a spot welder!

if you don't want to see me drilling a hole in my finger
[/quote]

Somehow I missed this thread. Funny story...

About 18 years ago I was building a deck onto our (wife and I) first house.  My wife was 8 months pregnant.  I was holding 2 1x4's together to make a rail (should've used a clamp) and screwed a 3 inch deck screw into my index finger, you could see the tip poking through my finger nail...pretty gnarly.  

Anyways I yelled for my wife to come unscrew my finger from the deck.  She came outside, I explained, blah blah blah, she used the drill to unscrew my finger...but she was smirking the entire time and it REALLY pissed me off.  She was 8 months preggers so I let it go.  About 2 weeks later I remembered her grinning at my impaled digit so I asked what was so funny about it.  She said "I wanted to say 'ill unscrew you if you unscrew me'".

I've never laughed so hard in my life 😀.

A bit messy, but gets the job done. I have a CNC machine I cobbled together last winter, drill press with XY vice, compressed air, tunes of course and internet access at the bench. Saving for a 3D printer next.

2 bays for cars, 1.5 bays for workshop, 1.5 Bay for Olympic lifting pad & home gym.. Either that or I've gotta have another section of the house for the pad, can't go snatching and dropping weights on joist floors. :(

so the table collapses, but the tops won't. 

Here's the only picture![primed|375x500](upload://1qxoe3MVSZU0Jv16qPfRZ16heeM.jpeg)  I have right now that shows it.

The base collapses and tucks away behind my work bench or saw, then the top just gets laid up against a wall out of the way. I can swap the tops out, I have one top that is a vacuum press, another that I'm making right now is going to have a router insert, but the main one I use is just a general workspace top. 

All the tops have 4 holes drilled into the corners that wooden dowels lock it into place on the table "stand" so it doesn't move around. My main one has 4 small holes drilled in so when I put my miter saw down, it can lock in too.

I'll show it to you fully collapsed and how the tops attach. I still have the plans for it too if anyone wants to build it. Only special tool ya need is a pocket hole jig, but there's ways around that too.

The plans came out of an old wood working magazine. My neighbor built 3 of them at different heights.

Getting an upgrade to my workzone! New table, and getting some more organizing space.

It looks nuts right now because we just got it in!

I see wallspace could be reorganized to shelve a 3d printer, they ain't that big. That seed spreader could be lower and shelve the printer above, in that environment I'd advise an enclosure especially with wood dust flying.

1st enclosure mounted to wall, then printer inside. For a chippie that's a piece of cake.

Ps. nice mancave

Nothing wrong with that Moon.... What I have a problem with is the whole "Ultimaker eco system" as in you buy our printer, our filiment and use our slicer and everything just works.

Reality - you get intrusive messages about upgrading the slicer software and when you do it's a buggy mess that destroys your projects because they needed to rush the firmware out to fix other issues in the last firmware.

I mean if you are gonna put VW's logo on your site and claim to be providing kit to top rate businesses I am sure you have to have solid products. 

There are other problems but in general it produces some lovely prints! ABS and Nylon are very easy to print with so its ideal for this hobby

Aww man, you have all the fun toys!
Can that desktop CNC handle metal? I think I can get the same model locally but I was never sure what it's capable of.

That's why I bought it. Of course has its limit being a CNC router and not mill. You have to go careful with the feed, but you can make fun stuffs. Stepcraft was the only one I could access in EU othersie you have other options too... Also the Chinese 6040 is pretty good and you get more volume and ball screws.

Thx man! Yeh DD is taking a lot of my time :joy:
This one I finished today. I have to assembly it though. I wanted a conversion kit for the MAD hubs. My next DD would be from scratch. I made the design and have the parts... Time to make it real. How are you doing with the DD?

If it can make a decent sized motor mount or 72t pulley that's good enough for me!

It can work up to carbons fiber and pretty hard aluminium like 6061. Can go up to 7070 but the setting as to be even more conservative for good tolerance.

I’ve been wanting a desktop router that can mill aluminum what do you recommend? Those drives look great

I did a bit of research depends where you are located and moreover how much are you willing to pay for it :grin:
Of course a CNC mill is more rigid and better for aluminium but the price starts from 3K for a pre-built one

Learnt from YouTube videos. There are free classes. One class a day for 2 weeks. Then made first enclosure and risers. From there is all experience and up to you. It's really well made and user-friendly compare to other CAD software. Plus free for student and makers (hobby level).
