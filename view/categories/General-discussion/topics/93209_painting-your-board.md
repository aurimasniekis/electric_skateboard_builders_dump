Lets kick this thread off and talk about all  the different ways we can coat our boards. My hope is that we can provide a useful thread of knowledge for the current and future upstarts in the growing custom builders market as well as the fanatical home builders with more money spent on tools than parts. :grin:

My main focus right now is water based polyurethanes. They can be tinted with most universal pigments and dry quickly with a very hard finish, a hardness that rivals a lot of 2 part paint systems! You can use a clear base and create any color you want with the aid of solids like titanium dioxide (white oxide) so you don't need to spend a small fortune in inventory.

So painters of the forum, lets here your go-to method of coating your board! What do you use, how are you laying it down, do you incorporate other methods like screen printing into the final product? Lets hear it!
