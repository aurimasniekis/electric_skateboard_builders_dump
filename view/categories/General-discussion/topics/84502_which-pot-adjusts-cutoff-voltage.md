This charger I have is set a little too high. I want to reduce its final cutoff voltage.
There are 3 trim pots. Anyone know which is which or have a schematic???
Cheers

Usually 1 is amps 2 is volts and 3 do not touch.

Mostly rojitor is correct, anyway look for kingpan charger 
This link has good info:

Thx, yep 2 altered the open circuit voltage.
I’m interested, how did you know?
And lastly, I’m assuming 3 has something to do with the cc dropping as it approaches cv??

```
just probe the dc output and see what happens when you try one of the pots. If the voltage doesnt move, its probably the wrong pot
