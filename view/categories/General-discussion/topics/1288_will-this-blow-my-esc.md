It depends on your gear ratio and top speed. It likely has a thermal shut off feature that will save it during hill climbing or other high output scenarios. If you decide on a VESC you will want to run it at higher voltages to get the best performance and cool running.

I build them so I find it quite easy to get them working. ;)

It is usually an easy setup once you have the bldc-tool running.
