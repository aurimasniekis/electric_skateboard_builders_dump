Hello all. I have been trolling this forum for some time now. I am about to order prebuilt trampa board and looking for someone in the UK who can build for me a custom Li Ion battery pack with BMS. Will really appreciate any help with this as I am really keen to start riding offroad. Many thanks

Haha, I am still not running. I am really bussy with my normal life. Almost finished all those packs. But am really bussy with university. In 1 months I have exams and esk8 & building packs take much time.

I have no affiliation with these guys or have any idea if they are any good.. But the site looks good and the photos look encouraging! I was looking at their site out of interest and this might be an avenue to try. If you do get help then report back on the forum to let everyone know your experience.

I think he can help him. But most battery builders are really bussy

Nah, I like to make them so they go up in flames in the mail :slight_smile:
 

Im full with orders and the hospital just delayed everything for almost 2 weeks
I could give you a timeframe in ~2weeks
The new welder I got keeps breaking the lipos every do often 

If you find someone to make you a battery, let me know so I can remove you from the "potential customers" list :smile:
