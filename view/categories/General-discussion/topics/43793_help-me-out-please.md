I had a bms and 2 lipos and had done a lot of research as well as @Namasaki helping me all the way. At the last stem after hours trying to do it, with his help I did it. Then I tried wiring the mains in series so I don‚Äôt have to use my harness, and I screwed up:frowning:. I connected the balance leads and fried my bms. I have tried so hard on this project and have spent way too much money on it. I‚Äôve beem through 2 vescs and 3 motors, and now destroyed my first bms. @scepterr generously gave me an offer to sel me his 12s bms for $30 and even wire up everything for me for $25. Great offer, really appreciate it. The problem is, I am way over my budget and I need $80 to pay him.  Don‚Äôt get me wrong I appreciate his help tremendously and understand that he gave me a fabulous offer. However I‚Äôm only 15 and I used money from working at a camp to fund this project, and I didn‚Äôt expect so many things to go wrong and spend so much money on this project. My first vesc blew its drv and my 1st motor came shorted. I bought another vesc and motor and it worked for a few days and thank something got stuck in the motor and i had to buy another one. @torqueboards generously gave me a motor for $80 shipped. I would appreciate any donations so I can have my batteries finished and start boarding around. 
This is my PayPal.me link: https://www.paypal.me/dgordon798

Any amount is greatly appreciated!

And thanks to everyone on this forum who have been so helpful through this crazy journey üòâ. Special shout out to @scepterr, @Namasaki and everyone else who replied to my threads.

Hopefully once I finish this project, I will return the favor and really try to answer more questions on this awesome forum.
Thanks so much in advance!

You've go some balls for asking for help at your age...I respect that, however when I was your age I would be shoveling driveways, babysitting, detailing cars, etc...Grab a shovel boy, you‚Äôve got a long road ahead of you

Also you‚Äôll probably have better luck looking to trade/sell something you own. I realize this may seem a bit harsh to you, however an esk8 is a luxury and not like a doctors visit/food (necessities). So sell your PlayStation/XBox, bike, camera, etc and you‚Äôll be there in no time

I have had few hard times in my life loosing my job because a company could afford me anymore and a year later loosing a job because the store closed and I have had to scrap up money from every where just to pay bills and now I have a pretty awesome job work on lab equipment plus designing custom skateboard board and longboards on the side and I have done this all on my own or with some help and encouragement from my wife. My point is you have to think outside the box to make money if you dont have a job.  Sometimes you have to sell off stuff you really dont want to but when it is the most valued item you own sometimes it has to go.  Hell there is always mcdonalds.  If you are 18 or older then you should start kicking the can down the street and apply for some jobs.  I hate when people just look for handouts instead of busting there ass to get what they want.  Nothing personal but stop looking for the handouts and start earning.

My honest suggestion to you is to think through if there is anything you can create to make some small $ or if you have something laying around that's wirth something, small steps! 

You won't have the money tonight or even tomorrow, maybe not even this week or month. 

Ask your folks for ideas on how to make some money. Maybe you could help out at home and earn a few bucks? 

If you don't come up with anything, then just accept the fact that easy money is a rarity for the majority of us and randomly asking strangers for cash is like asking for people to give you a hard time. 

You've probably already had your share of luck getting that motor for a discounted price, and getting a generous offer on the bms and wiring.. I believe this is where that kind of luck ends though.

In time you'll get there (as you obviously already have been spending some serious money on your build), and you'll probably even learn something from it. Good luck!

What I did in your age is fill out online studies (they pay you small bucks but hey its there to get). Got 2 hours up earlier in the morning to deliver papers, walk dogs DAILY of neighbors.

But anyway, you are 15 years old and are doing a hobby does easily exceeds 800.- FAST. Its just normal consequence that you run out of money at that age lol. Be patient, work your ass off, maybe learn what an hour feels like. If you push yourself and combine work, school and chores and it sums up to 75 hours a week, then you can ask for help. If you are not reaching those numbers consistently over 3 month then you are simply slacking. (ps: 75 hours are considered "normal" for ambitious people over here) and you being 15 means you have all the time in the world to accomplish your goal.

Ive waited months without riding because I blew up parts, Im 15 years old aswell, get a job or something, fix other peoples phones. I work at a club that sometimes make me work until 1am due to parties. 

I might sound like a dick but this is pretty infuriating. Coming from another 15 year old who works his ass off. I also have to part time at my parents restuarant with no pay, find one way or another to get money, don't just ask other people for stuff and try to make them feel bad for you. 

It is the equivalent as an adult living a decent life but then going into a crowd asking money to buy car. It doesn't work like that. People work their ass off to get the slightest bit of money and you're here trying to get free stuff. 

Its really pathetic honestly. Don't buy anything if you can't afford it, wait until you have the money.
