Things have changed overtime and I‚Äôll update this thread on Monday with the final deal we‚Äôd be getting. At the moment it‚Äôs seeming the well known wheel shape from lahambra or whatever they‚Äôre called will get to us at 104$ each person to get in and that‚Äôs for 4 wheel sets

This is the ‚Äúhouse mold‚Äù produced core we could use.  It would work with a pulley.  Using it would save the cost of having to make another mold for it ![image|281x499](upload://ugd488BOOa99IpQPhsXaKHlIDhO.jpeg)

Pay close attention to the core. A wide core is needed to properly support soft urethane.

In the beginning, a majority of longboard wheels were fabricated with rollerblade cores. Over time, the cores became the wide supportive longboard cores we know today.

Stoked briefly mentions this in their article about mids, a term that partly came into existence to describe longboard wheels with rollerblade cores.

Wouldn‚Äôt an offset core, like the kegel, free up more room for a pulley and clear wider decks (when using 90mm+ sizes)?

Centerset wheels have better wear, which is probably ideal if you're gunna be putting a lot of miles on them.

But I do think offset should be explored though.

People will probably be more likely to buy in if they don't have to buy a new wheel pulley set.

Almost all pulleys out there fit these two cores.  Why make a core that will have very little pulley support?

Those molds for those cores are owned and not available while the ‚Äúhouse mold‚Äù for this core is.  I can imagine people would want what would go with the pulley they have but not hard to design and get another made.  But I think there‚Äôs enough meat there and enough support 


But this would be more than a group buy as we‚Äôd own the molds so when the initial investors pooled the next 7000 maybe then another 500 wheels.

There are so many clones out there, I'd be surprised if you couldn't get your hands on some molds at a decent price.

while I'm interested in the idea of a new wheel company "belonging" to the community and can even invest $500 in this, unfortunately I'm already fully invested in the kegel ecosystem, meaning that all of my pulleys are kegel core compatible.

will it be possible for you to explore the same venture with Labeda instead of Aend?

Also, i'm sure there are members on here that are experts at CAD.
They can clone the core no problem and make a mold from that design file?

I'm not sure what you've worked out with Aend, but perhaps doing some smaller test runs of 10-25 sets to test out the cores and formula and get community buy in before going all in is the way to go.

Maybe you can get 30 people to come up with $500 each, but I'd be a little hesitant forking over a lot of money without any idea how good the wheels are.

If you're referring to Labeda, I'm sure everyone has access to the Kegel core, since there are so many other companies already using them besides Orangatang.
I'm pretty sure they have some house mold and house PU formula available to anyone too. The biggest question for me is what are the MOQ and upfront cost......

I do agree that you should stick to a certain wheel dimension instead of trying to please everyone because that's just impossible.

I have no issue with the investment (even if it requires a higher investment), but how to I get a return on my investment? Would I get a part of the total profit (for me the guy who does the contacts and the admin should get something out of it too, as thats a lot of time for which I'm not interested) or would I get an amount of wheels (as then I would have to sell them myself to get my ROI). Will it be a one off, or will I get funds when there are more sales later? Or am I supposed to chip in on any next batches too, ...

Interesting idea at least and it would differentiate my portfolio :smile: (i'm a silent partner in a firm, hence my questions.. and no, I'm not richie rich, I just pulled out from stocks and reinvested all in a friends existing business)

Edit: what would the additional cost be to for instance change from 91 later on to 105mm, 112, ... Would that require a new mold/new buy-in/...

Hummie again, I like the idea a lot but I have no interest in a 91cm center set wheel. 

The poll showed clearly that I was not alone in that.

If you want this to work you need to consider the majority and not what you personally need to work with your hubs.

assuming we can get a prototype 100 wheels made and 12 molds for 3000$, and that money was raised by 6 people at 500$ each, those 6 people would get 16 wheels each and each person would own 2 molds. When the remaining 84 molds we‚Äôd need for full production were bought by other people we‚Äôd be at the state where whatever the cost for the 500 wheel minimum was, let‚Äôs guess 7000$, an owner of 2 molds would be entitled to ten wheels for 140$. 

If the mold owner couldn‚Äôt come up with the 140$ for subsequent production runs of the 500 wheels the option would be left to the other owners to cover the remaining needed money and the other owners would get the wheels made.  The molds would still be owned by the original owners

Whatever you do with the wheels is up to those who paid for them.  Ride them.  Sell them.

 ill Check the poll again and see what was wanted and get a quote based on that.

Maybe a pulley for the core? Looks like Abec11 was playing around with something like that. Maybe it can be both cores compatible?

Or not.... Looks like this core....

I think centerset is probably best ultimately but offset works perfectly fine. You just don't have the added space to run a centerset 65mm or larger wheel. I wish I could run a center set but it just won't fit :cry: Especially, if you plan on going 91x80 lol.

Btw our 110x65 wheel will be cheaper than $140/set starting off. If that gives a bit more perspective.

Labeda says we could use their standard kegel core house mold and also their biggest house wheel mold which is a 90mm.  This is what Ollin boards is using to make the Popoca.  

 The minimum order is 1000 wheels and it will be 6.50$ each wheel.   So it‚Äôs the Popoca at 6.50$ each.  A bigger wheel would need molds made and that‚Äôs another maybe 8000$.


But if we go with just the house mold and built the bucks by smaller quantity at even 100$ each...that‚Äôs 15 wheels each.  Not my favorite size but at that cost I‚Äôm in.

Not sure if that would include graphics on the side or not but I‚Äôm happy bare.  We could argue about the core and mass color. 

I‚Äôd like to do it once just to do it and of course the awesome deal.  We could make it a minimum 100$ buy in. Easy.

This is probably a dumb question, but why not use abec/flywheel cores?

People will probably be more likely to buy in if they don‚Äôt have to buy a new wheel pulley set.
[/quote]

Because the ABEC style core sucks.

It's not very strong and the bearings get loose after a while.  Plus, it's far, far, far easier to drill round holes and use bolts to attach things, than whatever shape those holes between the spokes are on ABEC11 cores.

Kegel-style cores are better and stronger and leave more room for polyurethane depth.  All the new wheels are using them.  The pulleys not fitting are just growing pains that we'll all have to deal with.  But once we get all our gear switched to kegel-style pulleys, it will only get better from there on out.

You'd need to apply a bit of logic here too. Aend pour for ABEC, clones come from China. Aend will not allow us to steal the core from their main customer that they produce in house.

My concern is more about the wheel size... 91mm (??) That segment is already covered. If you see the Esk8 trend, wheel sizes are going up not staying in the middle. There is abundance of middle size wheels.

Orangatang - _**Kegel**_ is 80mm
Orangatang - _**Caguama**_ is 85mm
Enertion - _**R Spec Ghost**_ is 90mm
ABEC11 - _**Refly**_ is 90mm
Ollinboard - _**Popoca**_ is 90mm
Boa - _**Hatchling**_ is 90mm
Haggyboard - _**Se√±or Pepe**_ is 90mm
ABEC11 - _**Refly**_ is 97mm
Enertion - _**R Spec Ghost**_ is 97mm
MBS - _**All Terrain**_ is 100mm
Boa - _**Constrictor**_ is 100mm
Enertion - _**R Spec Crossover**_ is 100mm
ABEC 11 _**Superfly**_ is 107mm
Pramash - _**Lean Wheel**_ is 108mm
Slick Revolution -  _**Rough Stuff**_ is 110mm
Torqueboards - (**new comming wheel**) will be 110mm
Stooge - _**Rubber Wheel**_ is 120mm
Trampa - _**Gummie**_ is 125mm

In the segment between 80 to 89mm we count (2) two Esk8 wheels (one manufacturer)
In the segment between 90 to 99mm we can easily count (7) seven Esk8 wheels (manufacturers)
In the segment between 100mm to 109mm we can easily count (5) five Esk8 wheels (manufacturers)
In the segment between 110mm to 119mm we will soon count (2) two Esk8 wheels (manufacturers)  *
In the segment between 120mm to 129mm we count (2) two Esk8 wheels (manufacturers)

* Is worth noting in this segment that the two available wheels are just 110mm and there is actually a big gap with no wheel sizes filling the segment between 111 to 119mm.

So my idea is that we should focus on both upper segments, 110 to 119mm and 120 to 129mm wheel sizes, evidence of where Esk8 trend and wheel size are heading today. The new Torqueboards 110mm and Stooge 120mm wheels are clear sign of this.

You're absolutely right but the problem with a larger wheel size is that new molds need to be made, which means more upfront cost and a longer waiting time. This is because Labeda doesn't have any house mold larger than 90mm.

For a first time group buy of such magnitude and likely across the globe, in order not to further complicate things, I think Hummie should keep it simple first and just go with a house mold option. Once this is done, and things such as logistics have been smoothened out, then he can look at a different wheel size with a different design using a custom mold.

Lastly, while there already are a few options at 90mm, this group buy means that you're getting a Labeda wheel at a much lower price.

Just to clarify some things here (mostly for my own sake):

MOQ is 1000 wheels, or 250 sets of 4 wheels (best to do this by selling in sets rather than by individual wheels) at $26/set. 

If you target individual buy in at $104 at 4 sets of wheels each, you'll only need 63 different buyers (1008 wheels, 252 sets).

To summarize (someone correct me if I'm wrong);
Any interested buyer needs to buy a minimum of 4 sets of wheels at $104, but we should allow a buyer to buy more than 4 sets if he so wishes, at $26 per set.

If this is a go, I will probably try to organize a group buy for my country, this wheel is perfect for the Arcboard Aileron V2.

Hahaha it's Singapore, I didn't mention it as I didn't think it contributes much to the discussion. We are a closely knitted group there with various Whatsapp group chat, so me getting the group buy info out to them is relatively easy.

Plus with forwarder shipping, Hummie doesn't have to worry about shipping international, just ship to the forwarder's US warehouse and they can ship to us.

Shipping will likely cost as much as the wheels, and will someone be donating the labor and materials to do that for free?

What if there is a lost package?  Will the entire group refund that person?  Or will Hummie?  or ???  Who will donate their time to deal with that?

I think what we need is for some generic wheels to be made by lebeda and have them given a specific name so everyone knows what they are. Then have esk8 vendors buy most of the wheels in large quantities and sell them back to the market for still a reasonable price

Yeah. I want to let everyone know that all the groupbuy he organize he makes no money. hummies Decks, FSESC 6.6s, Hubs. He literally throw in all the raised fund into his hubs. He doesnt make much if any at all despite him putting so much time organizing with OEMs. I am not trying to turn ppl off, but I think there needs to be a mark up from $6.5 per wheel on this Groupbuy. He just told me that he wants to keep this non-profit, but I'm trying to convince him to see it as raising community funds for future projects. And supporting him to continue make great prodects.

$130-135 per set of 16 (32.50-33.75 per set)... would cover the US participants... 
$104 wheels
$19 for Large Priority Mail boxes/Shipping
$7-12 Time for organizer ($443-756 Total for organizing)

For EU/Aus members it would make much more sense for a single person to order them all in and organize shipping from a central place. 

I would also recommend forcing people to buy in 4 set lots (16 wheels). That makes it so we would have 63 lots and would reduce the amount of management for the organizer.

what a great opportunity this is.

Im down, as per our PM's but I think we need to agree on size. My only initial hesitation was I do not think there would be enough demand for the wheels that Hummie wants for his own projects.

We could get them made in 4 different colours and a buyer gets a set in each colour?  also some sort of DIY builder branding would be quality.

Hmmm you have popoca in black, Haggy in red, Boa in white, an upcoming wheel in baby blue (one of the current wheel out in the market but just in a new color of baby blue), Orangatang kegel in Orange and the upcoming Hatchling in yellow.

Abec11 is in green but that's a different core so it doesn't count.

So... The only choice for me to vote is green hahaha.

Or maybe you can include a blue as a choice. Not a light shade like baby blue but something blue. Else I'll be happy with green.

Making molds is much more difficult when using thermoset plastics like nylon. The initial model of the core is easy peasy, but designing the mold and accounting for non-uniform shrinkage is kind of expert-level cad work. You're much better off outsourcing it to protolabs.
