Hello, I have a battery on order from eskating.eu (10s2p) and I don't want to annoy them with emails since they are already behind (after the accident, big orders), so i'm wondering if anyone here have had an order with them recently and could tell me how long you waited to get your stuff (batteries mainly).

I'm currently on day 14 of the "shipped in 10-15 business days"

My order date, May 31 -18.

@fottaz is your man for this, he's snowed under afaik but get's the job done to a high degree of quality. It might be time to consider getting a second pair of hands Alberto!

I think we are chatting on whatsapp, I'm sorry that accident didn't help, and queue got big. We are improving battery production and hope to dispatch everything faster, I would say 2-3 weeks more + the 10-15 business days!

Yes we were. For all others looking at this thread, I refunded because I needed it faster, but I can strongly recommend euskating just on the costumer support alone they are wonderful to work with.
