According to Wikipedia "Louie Finkle of Seal Beach, California " made the first concept one and has a patent for it but was before motors and batteries were up to snuff.  Also preceded by a company releasing a gas powered one in 1975

Louie Finkle of Seal Beach, California is often cited as an originator of the modern electric skateboard, offering his first wireless electric skateboard in 1997[5][2] and filing a patent in April 1999.[6] 


Patent but no board ...Wonder who?

All fathers are now motherfukers. Just sayin‚Äô

I remember the first Esk8 I saw was at Sports Chalet around 2001? Back then, I had a $250 electric scooter for college called the ‚ÄúGo Motorboard‚Äù. I remember looking at the $5,000 price tag on their HUGE electric skateboard on display and thinking how I would never have something so awesome.

In the late 1990‚Äôs, Louie Finkle (aka Electric Louie) invented and patented the wireless electric skateboard. From handmade electronics, a 100% original brushed motor design, to the world‚Äôs first ‚Äòtorsion‚Äô trucks ‚Äì Louie‚Äôs first boards were truly revolutionary. Back then, most things had cords, and lithium battery technology was still in its infancy. Louie combined wireless technology, speed and power with stability and reliability. Exkate was born. The only downside? Price. Back then, an X24 set you back around $1200.
