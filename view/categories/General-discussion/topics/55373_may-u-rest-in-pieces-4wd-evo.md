He has ridden my board and gone up to 40mph on it and now other person that was riding my board that crashed  he road my board for a while went up to 30 on it and was chill thought not much of it accidents happen and no one got hurt but my 4wd is totaled completely

after inspecting 4  motors are destroyed magnets 
2 vesc pcb completely shattered  and other 2 ripped off the phase cables from pcb
battery only damage I can c is one battery is completely bent 
The dude fell and was use to his board and pressed down on the remote when he fell launched my board 60 hitting the concrete  pilar

Just fell off? Looked like he wasn't used to the deck/bushings/power and just over balanced, sorry about your board dude...

I don't even let people ride my gravity decks, I tell them the steering geometry and bushings are tuned  to my weight/stance & ridding style and anything more than walking pace would be dangerous.

dafuq that's like $1.5k in damages at least. 

whoever crashed it should be responsible, seems like they didn't know wtf they were doing. 

btw, ur not the only non boosted in dtla, you're in my hood right there by union station.

It might be nice if the VESC could do some sort of acceleration and amps cross reference. eg; Limit further acceleration when high acceleration and a low'ish amount of amps are detected (like when you aren't standing on it).

Looks like they grabbed a stack of acceleration _after_ coming off.

Silver lining. With the force demonstrated on that Concrete pillar, itâ€™s without a doubt that the board would have easily maimed a bystander. Luckily it was just a concrete pillar, and not an individual with a life ahead of them.

Sorry I'm a bit out of touch. You work for the motor manufacturers? Thats handy, just a quick cut and shut job and you're good to go.
It's a terrible shame the damage caused but so lucky no one got hurt. I've made the mistake of leaving my board switched on while talking to a mate at his front door. Tapped the trigger and the board accelerated into his front step smashing all the tiles from it!
Will you build a similar configuration or go dual this time?

You see..

Everyone is so caught up on the speed it hit the pilar.

But I'm pretty doubtful. Because the board hit the Pilar backwards, meaning the guy probably fell off and the board 180'd and rolled backwards on its own. No one here runs Current with reverse. So I doubt it hit the Pilar at 60mph... 

Just saying... It is the rear drop that broke off not the front.. lol your deck was probably compromised long before this... And no way it hit 60mph in reverse....lol

Since the @Ackmaniac Firmware has launched many People are using reverse. just a gues but the Firmware tweeks just made it safer and easier! I am running with reverse on every build because it is nice to go a bit back on a red traffic light ;)

why cant reverse go 60mph?
if you can Forward 60mph (noload) you can go it backwards

EDIT: it does not seem to me that the guy was driving frontwards and after the Crash the board spins 180 for going backwards. for me it seems as the board always goes forwards

Let's be clear the board did not launch into reverse , the video shows it but I know my board and the back left motor always got signal first then the other 3 so if u tried to do a burn out it would be the left motor . u can see the board not 180 but go straight to a burn out and launch to the right into the Pilar

You are savage man!

I kinda agree since your deck and enclosure has like way too many bolts to count. His has 8 and a piece of duct tape. Also I wonder how the internals would fair if they had been mounted to the deck vs it's weight resting on those enclosure pieces.

I don't get full throttle out of instinct? You fall off a board and you instinctively full throttle it lol. I feel bad the board got messed up but that dude should have never been on another board if when he falls he instinctively throttles the board. Also this is why I dont let anyone ride my board.

It is a bad idea to full throttle out of instinct. Instinct will guard us and not harm. So a normal instictful reaction would be to brake the whole way.

But never the less The guy somehow lost Balance. even at slowmo i cannot detect why. Someone an idea?

The thing is the deck hits a lot of things and vibrations which would just be basically hitting the battery. I don't know anyone who could "build proof " a board for a 60mph crash into a concrete Pilar in socal speed day I saw a 4wd evo by michal in Vegas crash it at 35 onto a edge of a parking lot and the enclosure and everything fly out

True.. it was a fast impact.. but I still think the deck was compromised before hand...  Sorry for your lost dude..

BTW don't let other people ride your board. Especially one with more power then they are used to... And not setup for them

It's one thing to share a slow carve build.. but yeah... Public streets, and a deck not setup for them. Whole lotta nope

Yeah , brining this build back to life is going to be tough lol . But in all realness a car at 60 is going to get damaged. A piece of wood launched at 60 is a goner. I'd always rather have my enclosure just fall apart and nothing break. But thats just me. 
The after math was hilarious we were all glued to the board and taking pictures to my sadden face and then a police guard walk up to us to c the commotion puts 2 and 2 together and asked us what happen. After explaining to her what happen she's like" you guys destroyed property damaged someone is going to get a fine " and were ah shit she calls her friend for back up and then she see the board and was like how do we even report this to much paper work and it's not vandalized so we're going to pretend we didn't see anything and you guys could just walk away okay ? 
and were like yep well take that we out lmao

Sad to see, sorry for your losses.

But I think we saw a downside of direct drive motors. Being outside the wheel, they can't take hard impacts. Put some polyurethane around it and they might still be fine.

Also shows the weakness of enclosures. With my hollow core decks, I've slammed them into curbs at 20 mph before with just a few markings on the board. Enclosures need way less forces to shatter and break apart.

Or maybe I'm just crazy? idk

If you wrap 75a polyurethane around that can, 12mm+ thick, a lot of forces will be absorbed. Those magnets shattered because you basically slammed them into concrete without any protection. Take one of these magnets, wrap it in low duro polyurathene, and that magnet won't shatter. But you would know because you put magnets in, right?

I don't think any board hummies,direct drives , satellite motors would have survived  at a 60mph direct impact. This isn't a matter of how well it's build to much speed for anything to be crash proof

don't get me wrong I've hit shit at 20mph and fell too nothing broke but let's be real if your board could go to 60mph and slams into a wall want to c those magnets u can glue them all u want they goners. I do believe that hubs would have absorbed some damaged but ain't nothing surviving 60mph smash into a pilar

If you smashed the wheel into it instead, I bet your magnets would be fine. Thick about it, the steel transfers 100% energy to the magnets. The polyurethane, if a nice 75a, would likely absorb enough of the forces to survive.

But it also comes done to magnet thickness. My carvon v2's had tiny magnets, so if the new ones are like that, nothing would of helped you.

That's true for plastic and other thermo formed enclosure. But fiberglass/composite enclosures do really well with strikes.. I have yet to see any of Eboosted enclosures crack.   And they have even held together broken decks..

I donâ€™t get full throttle out of instinct?
[/quote]

I'm guessing it's probably because @Exiledd_Top uses a finger throttle while Boosted uses a thumb throttle.  I use finger throttles and I can't use thumb throttles.  I will be fine for a while but then when I get scared I will push forward out of instinct to hit the brakes --- which on a thumb throttle is full acceleration.  It's like driving a car where the gas is on the left and the brake is on the right.  As long as you are consciously thinking about it, it will be fine, but as soon as you react to something with instinct, you will hit the wrong pedal

I ate street once and will never use thumb throttles ever again.

I'm the complete opposite I don't like thumb controllers. I like the GT2B because I used to race RC cars. 

The way I give myself better control and limit potential accidental throttle in using my middle finger "meat" to block the trigger. The finger always goes back in the position when I slow down so I have two finger controlling the trigger most of the time.

Isn't this one of the benefits of the fancy hi-tech pressure sensor boards?

I'm assuming you would be able to implant one of the sensors just to see if there is some amount of weight (greater than a few pounds) and output a signal. If the weight abruptly changes to nearly nothing, then disable the remote throttle, only allow for braking.

You would have to be careful if you enjoy board walking/dancing though. One wrong move could be deadly!

Just a thought.

grin tech does sell a sensor set and the owner, and of endless-sphere,  he made a board with it maybe 5 years ago now.  pressure sensors in the trucks.  with programing they get the bumps out and respond more to an average through time.  the pads on the board are quickly realized to be awful once the trucks are going, in my mind (I have tried that pads and they sucked).  he has some video of it and looks really nice.  ive never tried it though and maybe it would be harder.

H wobbled,paniced & 'fopped' off. Looks like a thumb stayed on the throttle? 

Increasing speed after dismount? Maybe the throttle did not increase but the load suddently was drastically reduced, once the UT gets back grip it would take off like a scalded cat which is exactly what happened.

Whether in reverse or not hard to say at the very end, all was lost at that stage pre-pillar anyways

User-error

What's more concerning is that could have been a bypasser instead of a pillar. A quick physical solution would be an cord tied to the ankle which goes to a loop key. 

More failsafes needed in this area

This guy definitely inspires me to work on a safety lanyard similar to a jet ski/treadmill. 
You lose speed control but Ive NEVER had the need to stop the board unless I was already on it. Besides the time I sent it rocketing into the woods when I dropped the controller...I pull my key every time I step off now...A custom stretchy lanyard killswitch on the knee would make the cops scratch their heads even more...hmm 

BTW that board sounded EPIC when it freewheeled, ha it turned like a squirrel in traffic!! It really  makes you wonder who it was originally aiming at :thinking:  It didnt hurt anyone or get run over by a train or a car, thats whats important.
