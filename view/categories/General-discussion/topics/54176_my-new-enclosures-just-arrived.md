Just had a package arrive with the new enclosures that @bigben made for me and I am super happy with them to say the least!

Looking forward to using this one on my new build.

I have unbranded versions in stock right now:

I was thinking this might be a good deck for a 4x4. Plenty of space in that wide enclosure!

Yes indeed :slight_smile:

Gonna have some fun with twin 6374s and then will likely add a second pair of motors in a few month's time

Looks great and high quality, but not cheap!
