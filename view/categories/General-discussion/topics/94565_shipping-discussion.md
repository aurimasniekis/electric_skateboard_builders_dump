So I dropped off my TB DD about 2~ weeks ago and still, no update shows as pre-shipment, I filed a claim with USPS, today Frisco Texas Postmaster called me saying that she had never seen the package, she said I should have gotten a receipt and the post office should scan all package's at the post office (mine does not...) she advised that my package could have gotten stolen and it could be sitting in one of the postal workers cars. She also said she could not do anything more (She was nice though trying to offer solutions and check up) one of them included maybe getting the post offices CCTV footage.

Don't know what to do RN, should I file a police report to see if the police can get involved so I can get some CCTV footage? (cause my post office workers are dicks and won't help with anything) (hoping my post office even has a CCTV...)

Package contians, TB DD 90kv + kegal adapters + abec adapters + TB110

paypal might have insurance built in for these kind of situation for both the vendor and the buyer. Maybe contact them?

what is going on here. Are YOU selling the drive, wheels, etc TO torqueboards.

I guess this is the first time you have dealt with USPS's flaws. NEVER EVER give anything to a postal worker with out it being scanned and given a receipt. EVER! Anything pricey should always be given to them and getting a receipt with the tracking number printed on it. You want them to go BEHIND the counter because that's the only time they are "tracked". If you drop it in a bin they tell you to do, then your package is not in a secure location.

You can be lucky and that this was an honest mistake. I hate USPS with a passion. I once had a package where the sender wrote the wrong zip code. I went to tell USPS but they can't do anything because the package was somewhere lost in the system. They can't leave a note with the tracking number to catch it. She said it would just be scanned and updating the site where customer check status. that it would be an unavailable address update and eventually be sent back to the sender after three failed attempts over 3 days.

Pro tip

When you mail expensive things you need to 
* get tracking
* signature required
* insure for double the value

Because this shit is never in stock, and your time is valuable.  These boards have so much of your personal time invested in them, and that's not an intangible value either.  If they want to lose it/steal it i fully intend to be made whole for the time, energy and capital i've invested.

Dumb question, but did you Google the location + lost packages?

Back when I used to ship ~10 packages/day for about two years, I had one package go missing. Upon googling the location it went missing at.... there were literally pages of Google results about shit going missing at that one facility lmao. Surprisingly, came to the dude a month later after I already sent him a new package.

I suspect yours will probably turn up, probably just in weeks to months.

It wasn't reviews. It was mainly keywords/tags that went to shipping forums.

There was actually a huge investigation at the specific office in question and they found out there was somebody in upper management running a theft ring haha. I'll try to see if I can find where it was in my old emails, Missouri is coming to mind for some reason.

Those motherfuckers have serious crime they're dealing with 24/7. Human trafficking, organ trafficking, large laced drug shipments, active serial killers, etc.

If a post Master fucks around, that's near immediate grounds for an audit/investigation into the entire office. 

Those positions pay fucking WELL(unless I'm talking out of my ass lmao) and have mad benefits. They typically don't fuck around because they don't want to risk anything and lose that.

Bottom line. You willingly handed a package over to a stranger and didn't get any sort of acceptance receipt.

The police can't help because nothing criminal has happened and the post office can't help because without any kind of receipt they officially don't have your package.

You just need to hope it gets there, you're unfortunately the one in the wrong here on paper. The post office probably just think you didn't drop it off and you are scamming them and the police can't get involved with no proof of criminal activity.

You just have to find someone who's willing to dig through their history (likely the post master) 

Are you able to provide the date of drop off? Time? 

Once you get that, in conjunction with CCTV footage is damning evidence that the package is actually yours... Hopefully expediting the process of finding it

Good luck my guy

Also, if you dropped it off, the CCTV has you there dropping it off, so go and see whoever you need to see and access the CCTV footage.

@Itsmedant Maybe you should read, ive alawys say this customer service is shit, just because post office is shit it does not mean that packages won't get delivered, also just because I never had any issues it does not mean that it is not shit, I could say I never had any problem with alextech so does that mean that he is not shit?

Unfortunately not last year I purchased a flat rate label at a USPS kiosk And then dropped it in the bin.. this was actually for a return on a blown vesc for torque boards as well. needless to stay it got lost and they're unable to reverse look up anything based on my credit card transaction number.

You can go to Home Depot make a purchase and then return an item just by swiping the credit card used... Home Depot has it together but USPS doesn't? wtf

I can't claim to know their system, and Im not calling you a liar, but that sounds funny.

I would assume that they do log those sort of things, but only enable those of high status ( within the postage system) to view it. Unfortunately it's probably one of those things where it's ' depending on the day'

I can't understand why it's not easily accessable :/

These issues should be escalated to correct these issues for others in the future. 

Once again, I know nothing of the systems, logistics or legal aspects of it, but it seems like it something that should be brought to court to settle once and for all. Maybe not for you, as your package might not be costly enough for the courts to care, but I wonder if they would care if the packages were more expensive/this happens more frequently

Hey guys, I just shipped a lacroix complete to someone but now it’s missing, I paid for the shipping online and then randomly threw it into a bin without getting any confirmation. Better call the cops!

Doesn’t that seem ridiculous to you @AlanZhou?

Grow up man, I know you are young but if you are going to be slinging around expensive parts, get a damn receipt, don’t buy it online, do it in person so the fault gets transferred to a federal employee.

It’s pretty simple how to make sure this doesn’t happen again. If I were the cops or the post office employees, I’d be laughing all the way to Idontgiveafuckville regarding your issue.

IDK what rules you go by, but I always mailed stuff at the USPS as a kid and asked for receipts, every damn year I brought in Christmas gifts to send overseas. My parents are both handicapped so I do a lot for them while they sat in the car. 

If you have a paid label, you can still get in line, hand it over to the person behind the counter and ask for a receipt. They scan, push a button and normally circle the tracking number

I also dropped 1 billion dollars in that bin and I have a record for purchasing the shipping label. Now it’s missing and I need it back from usps.

so with a PAID label, you have to provide an ID to get a receipt?!?!? If that's the case just stop buying or selling stuff. This is nuts!

Paying with a credit card and needing ID verification is understandable, but it's already paid

Then my point is still valid. Pay of it online, then go stand in line and get a receipt next time. Or every time if it's valuable

My USPS does this same shit.

But it never felt right to me not getting something in my hand confirming they recieved it, so I always stood in line.

This really sucks Alan, and I am sorry it happened.  I wish this lesson was learned on something much cheaper and I hope it all works out ok in the end.

Don't blanketly trust systems or people who are seemingly in a position of authority if your gut tells you otherwise.

I think you're all being a bit hard on Alan. As someone who never visited the post office to mail things before getting into ESK8, I can see how easy it is to do what the lady at the counter says and drop it off in a bin; I mean, these are government employees who deal with mail every day and presumably know what's best. 

Lesson learned from now on I'll always get a receipt and maybe even video the procedure from my phone camera poking above my shirt pocket (especially in high value items). I'm sure Alan will also get a receipt every time from now on.

Video is even a better idea, that way you can even send the video to the buyer confirming you have shipped it and if anything goes wrong it wont ruin your reputation.

**FACT 1:**  If your giving someone money to perform a service, they are obligated to give you a receipt.  If they do not offer a receipt, ask for one.  If they refuse, do not leave and ask to speak with a manager.  You are well within your rights and it's the proper way to complete a transaction.

**FACT 2:**  If you drop off pre-paid packages at USPS always ask them to scan them in and give you a receipt.  There is a national lack of "Give-A-Fuck" at USPS for some reason.  This is the only insurance you have, its not great insurance but at least its something.

Minor minor infraction 

Did I ever tell you the time my nephew lost his passport when he was 16 on holidays and it required my brother to travel 200ml while on holidays to get a temporary one. Afterwards the lost passport is found at the bottom of the kids bag

This is why youth is impetuous and wasted on the young, most wisdom is accumulated via experience, short cuts are not really preprogrammed

Only once. Like 15 years ago. But it was tough. I used to sell collectible GIjoes from the 60s and had this tiny ass radio that was worth like $400. I packed it small like a dumb ass and it got lost.  Shocker. 

Took a while, but I got the full insurance claim.

Had to prove value and such. A couple letters from reputable collectors and the like.  This is different though, very clearly worth the insured value for actual products, not the intangible value of collectibles.
