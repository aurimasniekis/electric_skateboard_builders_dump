@quanze If you don't have any woodworking tools, I can't think of a cheaper or easier way than buying a new deck with a kick tail.

Nice find Jinra.

An easy change to get kicktail, but it won't be quite the same as a real kick deck.  heavier, and you'll need some extra long bolts for the rear truck.  No big deal and definitely worth a shot.  If you have a $30 ebay blank, i don't know if i'd spend $20 to add a kicktail.  If you have a nice deck it might make more sense.

I personally would rather put the $20 towards a new kick deck and call it done.  One of my favorites is the [Omen Sugar](http://www.omenlongboards.com/products/sugar-1) - sweet deck.

GL!

Agreed, Better to just buy a deck with a kicktail than modify one. $20 isn't bad to add a kicktail, but it's not going to be as good as having an actual tail. For around $45, you can get decent generic deck with a kicktail. www.funboxdist.com.

I've already ordered Globe's Maiden: http://billykite.be/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/GLOBE-The-Maiden-37.jpg
I like that it has those raised bits on the sides for better control. Havent seen another deck like it with a kicktail which is why I'm resorting to adding one to it :confused:

I know this is 3 years late but i only just joined the forum...

Same problem, just thought of asking some street skaters if they have any snapped decks. Just trim it off, clean it up and bolt it on.
