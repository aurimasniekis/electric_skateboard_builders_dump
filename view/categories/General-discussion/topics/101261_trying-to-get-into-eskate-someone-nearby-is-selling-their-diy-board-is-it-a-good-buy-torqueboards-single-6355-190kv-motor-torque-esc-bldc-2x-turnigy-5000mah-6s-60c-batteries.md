Hi folks, 

I've been thinking of getting or building an electric skateboard for a few months, but money has held me back. Someone in a nearby city is offering their DIY board for sale, but I don't know if its a good buy and will perform well, or if I'm better off saving my money and doing my own build from scratch. I don't need a powerhouse right now since I'm just starting off, but I'd like to be able to upgrade it later. My main requirement would be that it not struggle up hills too much. 

He is asking $375, and says that it cost him about $700 to build. Here's the full part list he has given: 

1 TorqueBoards 6355 190KV Motor (https:///products/electric-skateboard-motor-6355-190kv)

1 Torqueboards motor mount (https:///products/single-bolt-on-motor-mount-set-only-black)

1 Torque ESC BLDC (https:///products/torque-esc-bldc-electronic-speed-controller)

Torqueboards 218mm trucks (https:///products/torqueboards-218mm-trucks)

2 turnigy 5000mAh 6s 60c li-po batteries (https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-battery-heavy-duty-5000mah-6s-60c-lipo-pack-xt-90.html?countrycode=US&gclid=CjwKCAjwkenqBRBgEiwA-bZVtoMljexVeUSM1Zke06iP-9hPq8vl5YAUygaYxBF0hFlGoIEhMGPUBxoCBiYQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds)

Torque boards nano controller (https:///products/torqueboards-2-4ghz-nano-remote-controller) 

What do you all think? Is this a good deal for getting into eskate and having a decent platform for upgrades? 

Thanks!

You know what, offer $350, you’d have a pretty nice little mono drive build. Plus some of those parts can be re used for the next build. This is all depending on how much use this thing has seen. Look at the batteries close. Are they puffy? Look at the wheels, are they chunked? Does it appear to have been driven in the rain?
Only other factor that I’d be aware of is how much do you weigh? Motor is in the small side for a single build. But you could always convert to a duel in the near future if it isn’t enough. 
Good luck!

@Lionpuncher Thanks for your input! 

According to him, it's only been ridden a few times; he thinks for less than a mile total. He says he broke his ankle (not on the board) and just doesn't have a use for it. Here's a close up of one of the batteries: ![68673698_10220248195020750_7091989611362123776_n|666x500](upload://jnXTrccXvWQbUJBfzIGTjAc1oi9.jpeg) 

I weigh ~160lbs. 

Unfortunately he lives about 3 hours away, so I want to be sure it's worth the effort before going to look at it / pick it up.

Huh, actually looking at the picture of the battery, it doesn't seem that its the same as the one he claims (5 cell vs 6 cell). Red flag # 1 I guess?

Yah, those are 2 5s packs in a 10s configuration. 

For a 160lb rider you surely will want to get another motor pretty soon. the 1 will get you moving and a good start to learn how to ride and get comfortable on it but soon you would be wanting more power imo. 

Looks to me like a great cheap start if you can get it for $350 and then spend another couple hundred in a month or two for drive train upgrades. The only think I don't like is the lipos, that can be a pain to take out and hook up to the charger every time it runs out of battery. They look to be in good condition from the outside though.

Ya it looks to be a pretty decent pickup so long as the guys not lying about the usage. But easily upgraded which makes it a win imo.

Id buy it. Definitely worth it. Idk what those wheels are, but probably worth a switch.

It's a fair offer. Just check the lipos are not puffy

Is this not concerning?
