Hi all,
I build e board spare parts as following
1. WowGo 2s esc
2.Very cheap bb vs battery
3. Maytech hub motor I guess
The range only 7 km! So sad
I think I need vesc to replace wowgo 2s esc

In fact, hy esc is more energy efficient than vesc, and the replacement vesc will be lower.

Your wording is incorrect, it's not that the vesc is not as efficient, but instead your pulling more power through the vesc most of the time which gives you greater aclearation

@Hoho0220  The max amps your esc can handle is 18a

Change the battery.  Boosted batteries are not very rangey.
