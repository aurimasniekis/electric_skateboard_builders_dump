The other day, some cat on here said he was planning to put a 10s5p on a board,
that's fifty batteries, the cell count alone complicates the whole build process. 
There has got to be a better way. 

I've been checking out LiFePo4, and it seems to be good tech. 

The battery folks love LiFePo4.

**They tell me,**
> _the flat prismatic cells are a more efficient shape for a battery than an 118650 cylinder._

* but the cylinders seem way more popular.

**They tell me,**
>_LiFePo4 cells can have very high capacity_,

* and I see 3.2.v 20Ah cells everywhere.

**They tell me**
> _LiFePo4 packs don't need a BMS,_

*  but I see LiFePo4 BMS being sold.

**They tell me**
>  _LiFePo4 batteries are less expensive,_

* and they sell them for less.

### So why aren't you using LiFePo4 prismatic cells?_

Did you ever hold a 20Ah cell in your hand.
I had a 38120 and they are heavy (and huge)!

The good LiFePo4s are the A123 26650 cells - but they are only 2500mAh and expensive

If you are talking about pouches i have never seen LiFePo4 pouches - where do you get some?

Yeah exactly these ones - mine didn't have the screw terminals though and were flat for spot welding. They are just 10Ah and I can only assume how big and heavy the 20Ah has to be ;)

I seriously explored these for quite a while but figured cylinder cells were a better long term choice. The prismatic pouches seemed flakey to source and expensive for the 12 I needed. It was hard to get the right dimensions with the right capacity, and discharge/charge ratings. Any A123 products seemed B stock and were pricey. 

I run an 8s lifepo4 setup with hobby king packs on my first build. They work well. 

Food for thought... 

My current build will use 26650 cells. They seem to have the specs I want and the cost is better than 18650 when comparing the pack build. <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/5/4/540ffcf529ce7eaa432cc797b0693e7346683a77.jpg" width="666" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/e/1/e1e746c253daa1bc568c6884fc77e53aacac7182.jpg" width="666" height="500">

I use a 15S lifepo4 prismatic pouch pack (no BMS) on my ebike... have done for years
I honestly don't know why everyone here uses 18650s even lipos are better in terms of power/space density.

I still use lipos because they are the best value.

I use a 13s 1p A123 20ah prismatic in my scooter and a 7s in my skateboard. using for over 1.5 years.
Both dont have bms. 
I have run down some cells to 0v and they revive like new. 
A123 is unkillable, most stable cells ever.

prismatics (the cell pouches) are hard to find in the dimensions you need them a lot of the time. At least that has been my experience. 

I would love to move to prismatics as a way to increase energy density and move away from the steel cans that add weight. But prismatics are expensive and like i said hard to find in exactly the right dimensions you might need. 18650s are dead easy to work with, extremely flexible for layout, and thanks to the vaping community the prices just keep falling.

@leroy this is why for me; the demand for 18650 cells has increased volume and availability. I'd happily use LIFePo4 if they were readily available at comparable prices. I'll eventually use A123 cells if a better option doesn't present itself by the next time I do a battery build.

Also, lifepo4 cells have a lower voltage than lipo and li-ion, so you'll need more cells in series for the same output.

I doubt it was actually 0v... I've done that to a A123 cell, it never came back lol. It was damaged somehow.

Does A123 even produce them anymore? I can only find them on eBay and they are still expensive. 

The industry will probably be switching to a 21700 or 20700 this year.

@Pantologist they actually added an 18650 lifepo4. I wasn't there there last time I was at their site a year ago... Not sure about how they are distributed or supply.

Interesting!
Unfortunately their new 18650 is not really interesting for us.
30A Discharge is cool, but 1100mah is really not enough.

i'm looking at the sanyo 20700 4ah and 15A cont. 30A capable. still compact. decent price.

tests online show them beating out 25r and hg2 in voltage sag, and almost double capacity at high discharge.

I'm new to all this but find it all incredibly interesting. 

As I have been trying to get a pulse on this industry and what is going on..  do you have an idea of generally when others might release theirs?  I ask in the hopes this is some sort of annual thing?

one of things I'm told by battery people is that the cylindrical cell is not as efficient  of a shape for 
batteries as is the flat pouches.
That's just what I hear,

Well, a box will easily fit a box's shape more efficiently while a cylinder will not. Makes sense.

I think the pricing is getting better.
I ordered a  19.2v 11,000mAh pack for $170,
I also got a 11s pack, but I don't remember what I paid or sold it for to be honest. 
I can get them assembled as I want, I can specify
"three rows of three" , 
which is really nice.

Just to debunk few myths about prismatic cells:
1. they "can be more efficient" but realistically they are not that much more than pack formed with 18650
2. prismatic cells require compression !!!! so your box has to stop expanding (swelling) cell. Cylindrical cell are perfectly self contained
3. prismatic cells are more problematic to cool because you pack them flat.
Reality of lifepo cells:
1. main advantage of using lifepo cells is that those are inherently safer to use, they will have a thermal run away but it's harder to achieve and resulting fire is not as bad as cobalt cells and definitely much better than lipo. 
2. secondary advantage of using lifepo is that operational voltage curve is very flat between 90%-20% making a control system much more simple.
3. third reason is that lifepo is actually lighter than cobalt cell (things tend to blur recently) but if you make a car than packaging is number 1 and weight is number 2, when you make a truck then weight is number 1 problem and packaging is number 2 so lifepo cell are chosen almost elusively in heavy weight vechiles (trucks, busses, tanks) 
4. fourth reason for using lifepo is that those tent to have less impedance on low drainage (up to 5C) than Cobalt. so you will loose less to heat - tends to matter if range is main problem.
5. lifepo is not using coblat which is rare metal (makes it expensive) and is _very_ toxic ... (so when you see EV car with cobalt cells on fire don't go near without respirator !!!!!) 

Any, absolutely ANY lithium cell REQUIRES bms ... without it you are asking for it ... if you will discharge any lithium cell (lipo, cobalt, ferrite) below critical minimum voltage you are in danger of fire !!!!!


and yes I design and make EV's :* so got few suckers like that kicking about for fun :P

ps. I would not advice to touch synopoly cells - those have 30% failure rate from **our experience** (compared to 5% for calb) they lie in data sheet (it quotes capacity for voltage drops that would literally destroy the cell) ... and price vise work out more expensive than calb (even tho calb charges more per Ah but hey charge for realistic capacity !) :/

That's 12S/8ah worth of prismatics above, and 12S/10Ah worth of 18650s below. 

I guess density depends on the specific pouches you use. Those pouches are older, but i may have found some that will give me the 12S/10Ah i'm looking for and will still fit in my box. 

But don't ever be confused about which cell format is more flexible for building. 18650s win there. I can get pretty much any shape i want out of them, even weird ones that allow odd counts like 13S. Pouches have to be worked around a little more when it comes to cell layout. 

*please excuse the messy 18650 pack, it was freshly re-packed.
