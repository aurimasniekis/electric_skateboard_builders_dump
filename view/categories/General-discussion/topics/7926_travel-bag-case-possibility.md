Just thought this might be something to look into?<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/b/b75abcde4a9d60e75ba0d653e4ffe388d64c0652.jpg" width="600" height="367">

I just walked into our advertising department at my office and noticed some cases that looked like it would fit an esk8. I asked someone where they get them from and I was given this site http://store.airbornevisuals.com/Bags-and-Cases-s/106.htm there's 24", 33.5" 36" and 48" at about $50.

My board is 36"x10" so the "Silver Bag for 36" MIGHT fit (not sure about the wheel+board height though) the interior measurement of the bag is 39"x10.5"x3"

I bought a rifle case for my dropthrough, with 83mm wheels and at 5" on the inside it barely fits. I don't think a 3'' inner height is going to cut it. :neutral_face:

83mm wheels, 180mm caliber fifty trucks and a typical 5 ply deck is about 4 - 4.5 inches tall, even taller with spacers.

```
make a pack that splits into ~99wh smaller packs or just a 99wh replaceable packs as the limits are 100wh or 160wh if you contact the airline 

*wh = watt hours

also look at this post for other "inventive" solutions :upside_down: http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/airplane-restrictions-for-batteries/7599

You could all ways purchase a yuneec or boosted bag. They have them on Amazon I believe.
