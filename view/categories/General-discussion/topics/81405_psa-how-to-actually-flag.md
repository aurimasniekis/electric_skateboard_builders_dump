Recently there has been an increasing trend of members flagging their own posts to signal the mods for closing a thread or editing an old post. 

Please, for the benefit of both the mods and members, avoid doing this. If you need to get the attention of a moderator to close or edit a thread, a PM or an @[name] is perfectly appropriate.

Flags are reserved for things that are actually inappropriate or in violation of our forum guidelines, so please use them as such. Thanks!

When I blow my unity up due to me being a tit I can't imagine anyone else fixing it for me ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ 

It sounds silly but what type of test do you do post OP to make sure the vesc runs well?

Yeah. That's the guy who was sitting on 250 vescs that needed a new drv. 

It's a shame @anorak234 is so trigger happy... ðŸ˜¢

Bump for this topic bc people keep flagging themselves to alert the mods... guys when you flag yourself it just adds a flag to your own profile and makes you look bad
