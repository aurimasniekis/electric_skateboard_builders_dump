Trying to create something a lil different. I've done a ton of research on magnets and electromagnetics. Just can't find a good enough explanation to obtain any real results. Yes I know how to build a small electromagnetic but can get it to repel anything. Question 1. is how can I get two electromagnetics to repel each other. 
2. How could I use an ESC to control the strength and polarity of an electromagnetic.
3. Is there away to controls the force of a permanent magnet so that two permanents repel at a greater force then lessen the force.
4. How big does the electromagnetic need to be in order to run it off 18 or 36v.
 5. My plan is to get two boards to repel each other so the top floats attached on an Eboard as a suspension 

Thanks for any input this community can give me. BTW yes I'm attempting a real to life hoverboard

Lexus tried it first and this is as far as they got. 

Not trying to be a downer, but I find it hard to believe anyone here could do such a thing. Im sure they had oodles of money behind this :man_shrugging:

That being said..... I look forward to whatever you come up with x)

@venom121212 you really beat me to it by a second :roll_eyes:

I feel like I remember seeing one that used magnets but it didn't have an onboard power source and was basically tied to the ground by the cable for power.

I would love someone to invent (or sell if been done already) electro-magnet snowboard bindings. This would enable real-world SSX Tricky shredding :-) 

DIY hoverboard using electromagnetism is almost certainly out of the pockets of non-corperations - unless you're a lottery winner...

So obviously I have researched a lot of designs and variations @Balta_6 what does me being one person have anything to do with it. Also I may not be a pro in your standards but I don't need that kinda title to attempt big things and ideas. 

Now I am not going with a hendo or Lexi's design. What I am attempting is to get two skateboards to repel each other, obviously connected in some way so they dont fly apart or spin around. The idea is that the board on the bottom has wheels and the top board hovers on top as to almost provide an interesting  suspension. Obviously the bottom would be a Eboard.

Also for those that think I need a million dollars to create electromagnetics. I can build 200lbs mags out of a microwave. The thing is how to get them to repel with a some kind of regulator to control the repel force.

Go for it though bro. I'd be very interested to see how you get on!

That's because they want  a back to the Future board. I'm not trying to attempt that. What I'm designing is much less complicated. Let's say the bottom eboard is made of copper. Strong electromagnets repel ferrous metals like copper also electromagnets repel one another. I just have to figure how to achieve voltage regulation so I can control when the board leaves the bottom board and how much force I can achieve. Ok let me finish building a proto and I'll post a YouTube vid for y'all to see what im trying to achieve. I think this would be an awesome way to achieve suspension.

Lol. I walked out of a shop last week because their bottom shelf was $100 an oz.

I get good nugs for $60 tops.

Okay so no Back to the Future skateboard yet... Sad :cry:

But except being cool for a project, you need to ask yourself why would you do that ?
Using springs with hydraulics is much easier and is assured to work great, maybe even better

Also with such "levitation", you need to still be able to use the board, so leaning on the side must be kept
And finally, if you manage around the problem of leaning, I fear it might only leads to wobble at low speed, the program trying to correct the vibrations, and small body movements. Or if you make you program to go past the vibration, how can you still control your board with slight ajustement (at high speed for example), because the program will just see that as vibrations
```

I will error on the side that you are correct about trying to control the vibrations and leaning and from Low speed wobbles with the electromagnets so that it is not unstable. but rt now lets just get it to float above the other board and stabilized. also i'm going to build some kind of box that is able to stabilize the two boards as i attach the stabilizers that will hold it together. If i don't use electromagnets i could go with a permanent float low tech solution but yet leaning will still be something to figure out..

The way i would do it (easy to do, not high tech but functional) is just 2 metal rods on each end of the deck that are attach to the bottom deck and go through the other one, through bigger holes to have less friction

I hardly think thats possible since even for a simple thing line the globe in the picture its not too easy to actually place it so it floats but it is also extremely instable. If you push it even a centimeter it will fall off. To make it more stable youd need a lot more power and i dont think youll be able to do that without a cable pulling behind you. The only thing i could think of is if you want to use the magnetic force as suspension and using it with railes to keep it in place

technical problems aside (of which there are many obviously), how the hell do you plan to steer this new fangled air-sandwich of a esk8 ? I mean, you have to lean heel to toe to exert a force on the trucks, creating an arc the wheels will follow (teaching grandma to suck eggs now). You lean into your air gap and what then ?

So this is not happening. I’m pretty sure magnets and batteries underneath them batteries won’t be good either. Not the mention the motors of the eSkate underneath the floating board won’t like these magnets and magnetic field either. 

Having said that, prove me wrong and show a scaled version.

Hehe bong water. Yuk.

So instead of electromagnetism I believe I'm just goin to use a ++ as a repel force. So as long as the top is attached in such a way so that it doesn't sway, the force from leaning should force the mag on the bottom to pivot. Ok so as soon as I have a scale mock up I'll show pic. Couldn't do much yesterday but fiddle with electromagnets and yes I can get the. To repel each other but not with great force. So 4-200lbs mags and 4 on the bottom in ++ or -- should give more suspension. Now for the air gap, it will be held closer than it wants to so keeping in floating no more than 3in. Of anything this will feel fun or a lil crazy to ride like my trike board.

Yeah... Sorry to ask but have you done your research ?
Using regular magnets and rails will works surely, but I'm not sure there is magnet strong enough to use in such application.
First lifting a mass of around 80 kg is not easy, and I don't think there is commercially available magnets that are that strong to be able to lift the upper board significantly (around 5cm would be good)
Otherwise, if only a very levitation is achieve, it won't dampen the vibration at all, and the 2 boards will jut hit each other at every bump

And then there is the problem of leaning, which is quite important
