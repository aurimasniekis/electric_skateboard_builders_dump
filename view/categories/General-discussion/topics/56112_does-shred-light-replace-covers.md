My shredlight rubber is worn so bad that it tear apart. They don't sell the rubber on website so wonder if  I can get replacement? ![20180520_153527|281x500](upload://bR6bcaDa4eidNPNRjBkEKcwTxbK.jpg)

I got a few spares from them during my warranty. Got 3 extra rubber sleeves laying around if you can't get directly from them.

I contact them but so far  they didn't get back to me yet. If you can send me one that would be very nice of you. Can you ship to Canada toronto?

Hmm sounds a bit weird that they haven't contacted you, did you use their [website](https://shredlights.com/pages/contact-1) to contact them, or email? I waited a few days for my first reply after I did the method in their website.

If you pay shipping i'd be happy to send one out.
