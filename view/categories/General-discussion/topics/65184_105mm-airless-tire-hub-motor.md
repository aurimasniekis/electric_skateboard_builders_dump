These look like the koowheel d3m motors with a different PU sleeve.

The same motors carvon is using on the Exos.

They are smooth and torquey.. 

These would fit ownboards esc (which is identical to koowheel)

Someome try them! Not a bad price!

Nice! The kit is also pretty cheap:
https://www.skullboardvip.com/collections/accessories/products/skullboard-kit?variant=13698879553593
385$ only without a deck.
10S2P 30Q is also fine which comes with the kit.
Looks a bit like the ownboard kit

Not sure that a durometer rating is typically given for rubber tires? From a quick google search, it looks like automotive-grade rubber tires typically have a durometer of about 70A.

Quick update:

1. I ordered Friday afternoon, about 1:30 PM PST.
1. The order was shipped out extremely early Monday (yesterday) morning, about 2:50 AM PST.
1. The DHL tracking is showing the estimated delivery as this coming Thursday, by end of day.

We'll see if it actually gets here by Thursday end of day or not. That'd be just shy of a week for shipment / delivery, which is pretty quick. For reference, my WowGo 2S got here in about 14-15 days, and my Ownboard W1S got here in about 7-8 days. I'll be sure to post back with another update once the shipment gets here. :slight_smile:

Hi @boramiNYC,

Thanks for your order, We will ship out asap.
I have never been riding a Meepo/Wowgo skateboard, so I can't compare it, but I have ridden a normal PU wheel skateboard, the airless wheels absorb vibration better. If you are like me, riding an e-skateboard to work, your feet will tell you the difference.:blush:

Thanks again for your order.

Hi @thiswasandy,

I am not as professional as you are, still learning.
But there should be a program in the ESC and motors, if they can match, they will work like a charm.

So I will suggest buy the ESC together for the best performance.
Thanks.

You know what I didn't even think of that. If these wheels were to use any standard core it'd put these wheels in a realm of their own. But what I wonder is would the core fit?

@SKULLBOARD would you consider making a set of these with a standardized core?

Ok, received the setup from Skullboard earlier today and just finished getting it installed onto the franken-Ownboard:
https://imgur.com/a/KrwCOvt

The current setup:
- Ownboard W1S with Samsung 6.0 battery and "no logo" grip tape
- Caliber II baseplates, 50* front and 44* rear
- RipTide APS 92.5A cone/barrel front bushings
- RipTide APS 95A cone/barrel rear bushings
- RipTide WFB 96A Caliber II / ESK8 Pivot Cups
- Skullboard front hanger with their airless AT wheels, with Boa Black Belly ceramic bearings in them
- Skullboard rear hanger with their airless AT hub motors

Not sure I'll have a chance to test the setup tonight. It'll probably have to wait until at least tomorrow. But I'll be sure to report back as soon as I get a chance to test ride this setup. üëç

Well, quick status update on those Skullboard airless AT hubs & wheels. Got them all hooked up to the Ownboard ESC yesterday, and took them for a super quick ride today. It appears that Laigaloon from Reddit is mostly correct - they'll probably need the ESC from Skullboard or a VESC. Without any weight on the board, the hubs seem to spin up just fine, and man do they sound beastly going full bore. When I'm on the board, if I rock the accelerator wheel of the remote quickly, like I would with the Ownboard hubs installed, the motors just make a weird quick on-off whining sound and do a slight twitch. If I slowly and super gently roll into the throttle the board will start moving and then I can start to apply more throttle and it seems fine. Came to a complete stop and tried the same thing again, and it exhibited the same issues. Completely letting off the throttle while in motion and then rolling back on it is not a problem at all. The Skullboard ESC appears to be physically the same as the Ownboard ESC, but maybe they've changed some programming on it or something. Just ordered the Skullboard ESC, so we'll see how that goes once it gets here. May end up just upgrading it to a VESC at some point, but we'll see.

Edit: To clarify, it only has issues if I give it too much throttle from a stop, like the amount that I would give it with the Ownboard hubs. If I roll into the throttle super gentle from a stop it starts going just fine, and then I can give it more throttle. I'm assuming it's an issue of slight incompatibility with the Ownboard ESC, so we'll see what happens when the Skullboard ESC gets here. Hoping it's not an issue with the motors themselves lol

The info we are all waiting for is how the quality of ride is ? 
If we could use these wheels with belt drive or CARVON it would be so dope !
Most of us don't use Chinese ESC but VESC anyway the important factor is the ride quality !!! 
Please update us on that point

Sorry all! The ride quality seemed to be fantastic from my very quick test ride. It definitely soaks up the bumps and cracks in the road really well. Big difference compared to the urethane wheels. Grip felt great, but again it was a very quick first ride, so I didn‚Äôt have a chance to test them at higher speeds yet.

Having a hard time understanding exactly what you mean with starting from a standstill. Is the acceleration really weak or is it ok as long as you are carefull with the throttle?

## \#70 Posted by: Narnash Posted at: 2018-08-24T08:21:17.242Z Reads: 353

```
TBH that squeaking/whining you describe sounds like an overcurrent protection of the ESC, it just shuts or drives a few of the phases while throtteling.

The same happens can happen when you define a hard motor overcurrent setting on a 4.12 VESC  (the sounds and actual results can depend on software version, too) with low values like 15-20A.
So this shouldn't be directly a motor fault but a result of bigger wheels with also higher resistance on the motors without accommodating these in the ESC settings (and If these are locked, yeah your basicly out of luck)

Can you make this happend ? I mean is it a possibility for you to use ABEC or Kegel cores ? If you need a MOQ for this please tell us and we will organise a group buy with the members of The forum so you directly have enough orders to support the production of theses wheels.
You have to tell us, this community definitely need these !!

I think I know exactly what you mean.

In my case if I did max throttle from standstill the motor accelerated for 2 seconds, then stopped for a second, then again accelerated 2 second, stopped again until I reached a certain amount of speed (like 15km/h) and then it didn't happen anymore.
If I was cruising 15km/h and pushed full throttle, no problems.
If I went under this speed, like cruising slowly around 5km/h -> full throttle and the same thing happened like I described above.
If I pushed te throttle very gentle, no problems.
Also no braking issues, could go for full speed and brake full throttle so pretty strange..

Really anoying actually, so I tried to find out why it was doing this, I changed the motor to a sk3-236kV and the problem was gone?
First I had a turnigy-125kV motor.
Used both motors unsensored so I still don't know why the other motor had this issue because I was sure that there was nothing wrong with the 125kV motor.

Here are some quick videos that I recorded for the Skullboard team, to confirm that it *is* in fact an issue of programming incompatibility with my Ownboard ESC.

Just started using 100mm MBS wheels on my belt driven board, boy what a difference. So decided that these 105mm would be even better in terms of absorbing shocks from road. 

I got the "Front Truck Kit" and the "Dual Hub Motor Truck Kit". I am going to use it with VESC. Planning to use it for my wife's board who weighs about 112. Should be enough power for her.

A four wheel drive is a possibility but the weight and cost of extra controllers is another problem. Anyone have any ideas on performance of these motors?

 a tiny motor will produce the same torque as a giant motor with same kv.   a motor's torque is based on it's kv (or kt).   the losses of the motor will be more for the smaller motor and heat up more and thats what limits its potential wattage but until the motor gets so small that the current no longer linearly produces torque, when the stator magnetically saturates, ,,until it gets that small, it will produce the same torque per amp based solely on the kv.  

those motor leads are not encouraging.  how thin are they?

Interesting, i didn't know that. These motors look fairly big for hubs. While the phase leads are discouragingly thin 20A doesn't sound too much even for those. Maybe i can put fans on the inside to cool them even more, or maybe some extra ugly looking heatsinks. 
Do you by any chance know what temperatures the motors can sustain, and some other way of bringing temps down? Would a rewinding help increase the wattage?

The 2 biggest issues I have with the Meepo and dozens of other variants are the ESC and the 90A cement donuts attached to the hub motors. Replace those with dual VESCs and 105mm squishy tires and you're getting closer to the ideal hub motor set up. Now THAT would be an interesting project to follow. Please do keep us updated on your progress. Thanks!

48 KV, if true, should make for *gobs* of torque, and 20 amps per motor should be good for pushing these things pretty far with a dual VESC setup, I would think.

Thinking about it more...

The 48 KV rating seems a bit low. That can't be right, can it? I'm sure it would make for great torque, but then I don't see how they'd reach their claimed top speed of about 25 MPH.

Based on their claimed top speed, if true (and I don't have a full board of theirs to test), then the motors would need to be more like 60 or 65 KV.

In other news, I got notification this morning that their ESC has finally been picked up DHL and is en route to me. Should be here by next Thursday or Friday. :+1:

48 x (4 x 10) / 60 x 3.6 x pi x 0.105 = 38km/h = 23.6mph

Not bad, with 65Kv motor you ahoudl get around 24mhp/39khm with 10s battery. They chose a lower Kv to compensate the wheel diameter and still provide good torque. The rubber tire should give a great grip. I will may get them. With a 12s should give you a great city board against bad routes.

Alright, tried out the Skullboard hubs + ESC on my Aileron.  This replaced the wowgo 2s hubs/ESC.  Already had a Wowgo 2s 10s2p Sanyo battery and just used that.

Miscellaneous: Paris V2 Trucks (back is just baseplate),1/4" shockpads, orangatang orange nipples bushings.

Comfort: Much more comfortable than the Wowgo 2s 90mm hubs. Rolled over cracks/bumps on NYC streets very well.  Was okay even on the shorter board.  Carving worked fine but I didn't fully test that out yet:

Speed: lower torque than the Wowgo ESC/Hubs, so getting up to speed and climbing hills was not as good.  Reached 24 mph, but took a little bit to get there.  There is also more resistance when pushing.  Depending on how you ride, the lowered torque may be a deal breaker. You may have better luck with a better battery and VESCs.

Battery: I haven't fully tested yet so I won't add details, but it seems like the battery depleted faster with this setup.  It could have been that I was really pushing the speed and up hills, so I'll have to keep testing.

Overall impressions: for now I'm happy, but it's still new to me so I'll have to keep riding to get out of my new toy honeymoon phase.  My feet are thankful and it's smooth.  It seems like it might make a good daily driver for me at least in Manhattan.

Any questions lemme know.

was there ever a motor that didnt work with a vesc? just asking, havnt heard of any.
if they have less resistance than pneumatics great, if it is not much more, i would still use them since they are less prone to damage and they are probably also lighter. but not sure about that part.

I bought the same hub kit from Dani here on the forum and then found Min's site to order the ESC, stoked to see what these can do.  

I have been >this< close to calling a friend in Ohio and having rear rubber tires made for the Raptor 2 for some time.  The problem is rolling resistance as you can imagine; higher resistance from friction, specifically, and the heat that comes along with that.

For these Skull (Jomo / Koowheel hubs) my only concern is heat.  

The hubs are 350W and are insulated in a giant piece of rubber that we know will deform as it heats up - what could possibly go wrong? lol we need @b264 to bring us back to reality :cool: 

In regards to using Vedder-compatible ESCs instead of the SB ESC: my concern is braking at >1 MPH in FOC - we have an entire thread on how in some cases brakes will grab at slow speeds in FOC (my @kaly does not do this, but my other board does).

Since the Skull Board cans are wearing real automotive car tire rubber, which will be nicely heated simultaneously from the hub on the inside and friction street-side (it's a feature!) the rear tires should be nice and sticky and VESC FOC brakes could just halt the board outright, Meepo V2-style.

I suppose we will find out in time.  The last cruiser prototype we tried with Jomo (Koowheel) hubs and VESCs, the board got slower with almost too-high torque, there was no benefit.

Got them and tried just a couple of miles. I got their ESC and a Sanyo 10s2p. Overall they are great. Good torque but as stated getting up to speed requires a bit. The tires are amazing. Butter. However at low speed, probably due to the tire design for water there is a little vibration. This‚Äôs weekend I‚Äôll try to get them on a dual Vesc 6 setup and a 12s since I think 10s is a little low for a 190lbs guy.

@Benjamin899 Yep, can confirm it's *slightly* wider than the Caliber II hanger. Also, the low vibration is not uncomfortable at all, it's just something that you notice as being there at first and then you don't notice it after a little while.

@Jedi Not positive which mounting pattern it is, but I can confirm the mounting pattern on the Skullboard baseplate is the same as what's available on the Caliber II baseplate, as well as the Ownboard baseplate, and matches up to the holes in the Ownboard deck perfectly. I'll have to measure real quick to tell you exactly which pattern it is.  

@DAddYE Awesome! Looking forward to hearing how it performs with dual VESC6 and 12s! I'm 200 lbs, and thinking about doing dual VESC6 with this setup, as well. Not sure yet if I want to go 12s, though, or stick with 10s.

testing TB 10S3P and Miami 12S2P with a front Avenue; will update tomorrow.

PSA: just in case any of you beautiful people are thinking about a little 'ready, fire, aim' like I did:

my bud here has a factory SkullBoards complete that presents _significant_ hub heat (as predicted), _heavy_ sag (as predicted) with the standard battery, and (uh oh) 'weird vibrations'.  


For this much-needed scientific test that nobody in the community is clamoring for ;) I threw a front Avenue RKP truck, Zealous ceramics, and downgraded from Riptide to Orangatang Purple Nipples to bring handling on the Randal-based clones back from theoretical to practical (they return to something... but it ain't zero).

Tip: file down the pivots on all these new 'reinforced' Chinese hangers; on the last 5 completes, all had burly seams from the casting process that literally dig into the pivot cup and turn the pivot cup, instead - turning ball-and-socket into mortar-and-pestle.  Guacamole!

will post more on "PROJECT SKEEVO" tomorrow :) make good choices!

I use @alphamail's Riptide risers on this prototype Evo with Rayne cork shock pads.  http://www.riptidesports.com/electric-skateboard/

I had new Riptide cups in this build, yet the rough edges on the Chinese hanger tore the Riptide cups.

I filed the hanger smooth, by hand, and then reinstalled the factory cups with a little graphite to stop the creaking.

Tomorrow, we will run the hubs ten miles on 10S3P.

Hey there guys! 
I was originally only going to pick up the skullboard rear truck kit + front wheels...But ultimately, i did not want to go taking apart my current set up which is working soooo perfect for me right now.

Sooo to rule out any esc incompatibilities and such, I opted to just buy a complete skullboard (s1 model). 
Charged it up to 99% last night and took it out for my first spin..... Tonight I charged it to 100% and took it out again. And I have the same report for both rides..
I definitely was looking forward to a nice smooth cushioned ride with those big soft rubber wheels, 
But that was definitely not the case.. At the moment, I do not fully know the cause of the issue - but I have lots of vibration vibrationnn vibrationnnnnn... I checked allllll the nuts and bolts and everything is secure. 
After riding the board for only about 5 minutes, my feet are tingly and toes are numbing. 
Definitely more noticeable vibration at slower speeds. BOTH front and back feet are getting the vibration. 
I was anticipating a much more cushioned ride, but that is simply not the case! 
It is noticeably loud. makes my wowgo2s on avenue trucks sound silent and muchhh much smoother in comparison. I wonder if it's the pattern of the tread, Making the sound/vibration.. or if it is the motors.. but I'm not 100% sure.  When i test the motors up off the ground, they spin smoothly without any vibration or noise..
With the board flipped over, testing the wheels - Visually they stay very uniform and there is not wobble to indicate that they may be unbalanced etc.. 
There is a VERY loud sound associated with carving in the front wheels. It sounds unhealthy. (This is on very smooth pavement in my condo's very large parking lot.)  I took it out across the street to much larger parking area by where  the asphalt is much rougher, and it definitely is tough on the feet out there too. 
The large tires did help absorb the large bumps and cracks when I rode through them to test it.. But i'm a little torn about that payoff, because with the wheels, i'm also getting much much more vibration, and noise, and rough riding ALL the time on the S1. The skullboard s1 did not make it up the same hill my wowgo2s does. 
(Both at the highest speed setting.) The s1 crapped out about 60% up the hill to a full stop. I pushed on the throttle til it just would not go anymore.. First attempt up the hill was at 75% battery. Second attempt up the hill was with 100% battery. Same exact result.   I rode the board until my remote buzzed stating that the battery was at 25%. At this point, there was very significant lag off the line... My total ride time was much shorter than my wowgo2s. and in comparison, my test ride wasn't even really pushing the speed and terrain as I do i standard rides... When i got home, i touched the rear hubs and truck to feel how hot it was.. couldn't keep my fingers on it for 2 seconds. it was hotttttttt... like worrisome hot... Also, Skullboard s1 was delivered with wires backwards on the hubs so the remote reverse switch is flopped.. It is a small deal but man.. good quality control is in the details!  I'm surely not impressed by the skullboard s1 full setup and those rubber wheels at the moment.. But perhaps this can change if I can solve the battery power and torque issues first, then figure out where alllll this vibration and noise is coming from. I'll try and get some video footage of the sounds and such this weekend.

Cheers!
Don Ta

I also came from a Wowgo2s setup (using Paris truck up front and baseplate in the rear).  Vibration at low speeds is present but more likely due to tread pattern, and I sincerely doubt that's what's causing your particular vibration issues!  Maybe switch out your front truck to isolate if it's coming from front or rear for now.  Check the tightness of your kingpins and make sure the wheels aren't torqued on too tight or loose (common with some of the value boards).

I have also experienced the torque loss compared to the Wowgo hubs but didn't check to see if it was overheating.  It just doesn't "feel" as quick.

I tested the hubs a little today, and in SF they feel a bit underpowered. I suggest for hilly areas to opt for a 12s setup.

@SKULLBOARD the ESC seems very similar to ownboard/wowgo one. They both support 12s batteries. Will your ESC be able to run on 12s without issues?

I checked a few times and the hub was a little warm, so I don't think the underpower was due to temperature.

I'd be surprised if  vesc didnt make these perform better. We had the same issue with Pulseboards Echo, when you run a generic esc like ownboard and it is not configured well, the torque is just average and when you run VESC you immediately see a bump In torque and overall performance, even better battery life.

dont forget, if the magnets get hot, the magnetic field is constantly getting weaker and hence you have to pour even more amps into the motor, thats a vicious cycle of heat^^

Sorry for the wait, my only cable that works was not with me. So, I have 
motor max 30A
motor min -20A
batt max 40A
batt min -20A
I'm not sure this is optimal though. But, it seems to work ok. When braking hard there's a momentary cogging/slipping in motors. But, braking force is adequate for me. And top speed is around 23mph.

Oh, and I'm currently running BLDC, so it's loud and there's the initial cogging.

Usually motor max is always higher than battery max. So if you try like that maybe start with 20A on battery max too. You will never draw 30A from you battery on each vesc with 20A on motor anyway.
If you want to run them in BLDC sensored better to use hybrid mode. If you run them unsensored doesn't matter at all. With the motor min and batter min you regulate the brakes, but should be already fine with the value I suggested. If you install @ackmaniac firmware you can play with acceleration and brake curves, to really customize the throttle. You can also add  a bluetooth module and have telemetry on your phone and change vesc setting through the app. No needs to open the enclosure anymore.

Yeh probably those motors are capable of more but being hub motors plus cover with tyre rubber doesn't help. Would be good to run them higher since they are 105mm and the torque will be affected. Maybe a 12s setup that gives more watt with less amp would do the job.

The amps to the motor will be the same regardless of the voltage of the battery and converted by the esc. Just as hot.  Why people say they have experienced cooler motor temp w higher voltage doesn‚Äôt make sense.

Be nice to know what temp the mags can hit before demagnetized.

I thought the logic behind is that the power is watt= volt x A. So if you have a max of 20A you can play with voltage to get more watt for the same current. Why do you think that doesn't make sense? I mean you build motor so I would like to hear from you. Thx

## \#244 Posted by: Hummie Posted at: 2018-09-08T17:14:19.420Z Reads: 203

The esc converts the battery voltage to current so u can have more amps going to the motor than came from the battery.  Only amps create torque in the motor. So u could have battery amps set to maybe just 20 but have motor amps set to 100 and it would only take max 20 from the battery yet have up to 100 going to the motor at slowest speeds. The conversion to amps happens based on the duty cycle which is same as the rpm so at slowest soled the most conversion can happen 
I think foc is a bit more efficient in the motor at least.  But if the rubber can take the heat and the magnets can too then doesn‚Äôt matter really.  What temp can the magnets get to is worth knowing. They will demagnetize permanently over the temp and also lose partial magnetism non-permanently on the way up to that temp. And the motor compensates w more amps needed and greater heat
```

I tried 20A for motor and the torque feels weak. Feels similar to the Wowgo2s ESC in acceleration. I think 20A is a safe estimate. I changed it back to 30A and the accel is so much better. I think I'll play around 30A for motor. 

Batt min also at -8A made the brake a bit weaker, I have it to -16A and the brake is stronger. 

If anyone's trying the same, I'm not riding in these setting extensively. Just a few miles at a time for testing at the moment, so use these numbers at your own risk.

I think u can set the regen higher than the stated battery charge rate.  If the difference is possibly decreasing the cycles of the battery vs having brakes n not crashing the latter sounds better.  The charge rate stated by the manufacturer is just one number but the reality is it depends on the cell‚Äôs SOC (state of charge) and u can jam more amps in at the lower SOC.  The indication of decreasing cycles is heat. If ur charging or discharging and getting hot they‚Äôre being pushed hard. Maybe add some airflow and I‚Äôve heard of batteries getting hot as the heat is trapped in the enclosure. Unless ur riding in the wetness much better for your stuff with an airflow to let the heat not accumulate. 
And then when ur braking it‚Äôs a short pulse given to the cells n not sustained.  I‚Äôve read many studies where cells actually benefit, and this is many chemistries including lithium, where you make the cells ability to store energy better with huge current blasted in with both pulses or extended charging as it smoothens out the formation of the dendrite growth which are the main culprit with decreasing storage and also internal shorting.  Not fully charging also is a big plus in this regard. 4.15 max and cranking the regen braking way up gets my vote
```

True that. These short regen pulses should not be compared with continuous charge rates. While charging the batteries with high current they will heat up and that is one of the biggest damaging factors. But when it comes to regen that is so short so it really can be neglected. And in the end breaking 1 meter earlier or later could mean the difference between under a truck or near the truck haha.

Unless ur Vesc is crap u should be fine at even 100 motor amps. Especially on foc it makes for a much better ride without sensors.  Try at least a minute and tell us what u think.

Dd you turn your remote on while holding the throttle? I had this issue with the nano x. That sometimes causes the motors to accelerate like crazy and you have to hold the throttle back so it stops. Thats my best guess

With Nano-x you also have to remember to do the ppm signal mapping with the remote set on pro mode and not slow, otherwise you get 85% of the throttle. Moreover every time you turn on the remote you have to do the quick calibration. If you don't do it that you will get really sketchy throttle and brakes.

The only problem I could think of is that you coild boil your motor when you up your max. motor amp to something like 100A ea or similar. Since you lack a tempsensor (so no VESC overtemp protection) and run most likely obove motor Amp limit. Sure as long you can touch it it should be below  ~65¬∞C, non the less if you run sensorless and up your motor amps keep an eye on your motor temps manually.

But I can confirm that a higher motor Amp max can solve coging issues in FOC.

After reading a lot about it I think is the failsafe. Basically when loses signal for 1sec it brings you where you were (I was starting at at stop light, so the throttle was max), then back to zero. 
I switched to the mini remote. :slight_smile:

I typically use a -20 throttle curve, but I have to play with it on each board. Start there and then adjust.

motors getting hot I assume you mean.   in my experience with hub motors the high motor amps make it smoother and can start from a stop without sensors.  and low speed torque.  but your motor has maybe double the poles of what I use so different.   but im talking about the motor amps up high.  that works well for what I listed above.

I need to hear what it a good smooth set sounds like, Skullboard is claiming that my vibration issues are "normal" ... I find it really hard to believe that THIS amount of vibration is normal. The whole skullboard campaign was advertised as "extremely durable, REDUCED VIBRATION, and anti-slip!" haha !

It might not make you happy, but the vibration issue at slower speed less than like 15mph is bigger than I first noticed. It's loud and rough until the speed reaches past 15 or so. Skullboard needs to release wheels without the tread pattern. It's not really necessary on a round profile wheel and causes unwanted vibrations and noise. However, the grip stays strong the best part about these wheels.

Thanks my friend, I do appreciate this.  I did not know our picture was being used (thanks for all who emailed me) and yes, that is our Skeevo prototype.  

I've never corresponded with anyone at DIYeboard to my knowledge, yet I am their customer for one of the three batteries we tested in the Skeevo... this is Shenzhen, they're sharks :) 

Great update! We're working with @SKULLBOARD on the hubs and will update with a new review in a few weeks.

After discussing with Min, we're taking the SkullBoard out to test on:

* Real-world rough pavement and bad streets (not smooth pavement)
* using an official Boosted Board (OEM Loaded Vanguard) deck 
* with custom, modified Caliber II trucks, Riptide, etc.
* in 10S2P and 12S2P

Our friendly suggestions to SkullBoard include:

* Check with the hub manufacturer on the tire installation process; in Min's defense, these tires look like they're born perfectly balanced - and then, in a second step - the tires look to be mounted on the rim / hub with a heated tool.
* Save the siping for a proper pneumatic tire. We know from cycle racing that siping and dimples on hard rubber creates road noise in the tire cavity; most high end tires have some kind of cavity noise reducing layer, inside.  The advantage of solid wheels (no cavity noise) is totally negated by the siping, which is deforming anyway since the tire is perforated underneath the siping.  Good news: new tread was already in path for SkullBoards :cool: and it sounds promising.

I can tell already from my experience with the hubs I have, the 'winner' will be 12S2P on the official SkullBoards ESC - presuming I can find a way to properly cool it.  Will update when they arrive!

After riding for a couple weeks everyday, I think it's possible if you just cruise below 15mph. But, my feet don't go numb. It could be commuting 2 years made me more immune to numbing or my usual speed. I'll try to video sometime this week. 

BTW, for anyone interested in my FOCBOX settings, I think I am settling at these numbers. 

Motor Max: 30A
Motor Min: -30A
Battery Max: 30A
Battery Min: -15A

I upgraded FOCBOX firmware to 3.1 from 2.14 and started using Akimaniac tool and saw noticeable improvement in accel curve. Some other numbers like higher motor max caused some glitches in control.

On asphalt, the speed range where vibration becomes noticeable is narrower so mostly it's fine. On cement surface the noticeable range becomes wider and noise louder. I personally have no issues from the vibration. Just wanted to show @donta42 if his/her issue is comparable. But, if you constantly cruise in speeds range where vibration is noticeable it'll be pretty annoying.

It honestly doesn't surprise me in this particular instance, since all of Skullboard's hardware looks to be exactly the same as Ownboard's. Ownboard utilizes, I believe, Crownwheel for their manufacturing and supply of parts, so it stands to reason that Skullboard probably does, too.

I've reached out to Crownwheel directly about a modified version of the airless AT hubs/wheels and they've told me that a completely new mold would have to be made because of the ownership rights of the current product. :man_shrugging:

wait a second. the kegel core seems to be part of the wheel. surely the wheel has to be a high duro? or any softness in the wheel  will break any non-metal pulleys?

In my experience, no matter the wheel diameter, if its a 85+ duro, it is gonna be a bumpy ride. Only way to make a ride softer is lower duro or flexy deck.

As for offroading, i doubt you can do anything on these that you cant with the mbs AT wheels or the abec 107s.

what am I missing?

SkullBoards wheels do fit Caliber trucks, and would necessitate an entirely new pulley.

Coincidentally, we're awaiting replacement rear hubs from SkullBoard, to mount on a pair of chopped Caliber 2's, for our Enertion Raptor 2.  

We're thinking about reviewing against real-world rides, like, riding across Facebook HQ campus from building 40 to main cafeteria - the roads suck, pavement is super coarse, and everyone is annoyed by you and wants you to street your face.  

I think the SkullBoards wheels might do well, there. :)

Yes, but if you have to replace all motors when the rubber wears out, the cost would be high. The rubbers seems they'll wear out at about 500 -1000 miles which is less than a year of riding for many of us. Better solution there first would be nice.

Awesome! Which VESC are you using again? I really need to pickup a dual VESC setup soon so that I can try that out. 

What kind of range and top speed are you getting now? Also, what type of battery pack (and what cells) are you running your setup with?

Just received a set of 4 (front) wheels, delivery was quick, great service and all, pleased to see bearings and spacers included, really nice looking beefy wheels. For now, they're just bolted on a EVO push board/ land paddle board, while I work on a way to mount a pulley.

However I must say that I'm pretty disappointed by the quality of the ride at pushing speed. (or maybe I had high expectations of smoothness). Definitely lots of rattling, vibration and noise, and resistance to roll. Nothing to do with the thread pattern, but with the holes in the rubber. If you're a heavy rider (90kg / 6kg board), the compression on the tyre is uneven due to the spacing between those holes, and you get that feeling of riding wheels with flat spots. 

The board by itself rolls beautifully and smoothly, but as the load increases, vibrations arise, and drag increases. Very noticeable when pushing as there is a partial weight transfer on the pushing leg.  
I believe those wheels would feel fantastic for a 60kg rider, but for heavier riders, the same tyre without those holes (making it homogeneous then) would be soooooo much better. 
Maybe better at higher speeds though, and with a motorized solution, extra resistance to roll wouldn't be that bad. So I'll give a second opinion then.

A more flexible deck (than the EVO!) could also dampen some of those vibrations to a more acceptable level. 
More testing to come. Just didn't want too many people to get over excited, like I was...

I had that idea about injecting filler into the holes last night as well. I just ordered some Permatex 82180 RTV gasket maker and some craft syringes. The stuff has a pretty decent working time and is designed to hold up in a lottttt of heat. I'll take some pics and vids along the way when I get it going this weekend. 
I'm also thinking about just filling in the tread cavities as well, maybe up to 80-90% of the depth.

I weigh 175 and still think the benefits outweigh the problems. At speeds of around 18 the vibrations are non issue. At any speed improvement in traction is significant. On any turns a few loose gravel and bumpy surface don't cause slips which is a huge con for any PU wheels.

Had a bit of tow-in behind a friends e-bike to see how it was at higher speeds than push speed, and there's still lots of vibration and noise at what I would consider a nice cruising speed. The resistance to roll is also very significant, when compared to urethane wheels. With that in mind, I don't really see how the two 350W hubs from the pre-made boards would do the job for heavy riders. 
Using significantly beefier motors with belts/chains would overcome that, but at the expense of power frugality. This will be my next goal. But at this stage, might as well use full-on mountainboard wheels...

On the plus side, going over some hard dirt track, grass or pebbles felt kind of good, behaving much better than urethane.

I‚Äôm just a chicken lol. No, I needed up riding it. 

I just did the front wheels. Vibrations are still there, a little less but for me never was a big deal since happens at low speeds. My main reason was for improving a tiny bit the rolling resistance which is too early to say but seems a bit better.

Here some pics (don't laugh):

I've another important question. It seems to me that the motor **can't handle well 30A**. __It stutters if you give full power when you start standstill__. 

@SKULLBOARD list it as 20A max. 

However, [diyeboard](http://www.diyeboard.com/10568mm-airless-all-terrain-wheels-dual-hub-motor-truck-kit-p-693.html?zenid=0f04vt4a29s3rkibhmslp1er24) list it as **30A**. 

Can it be that's because @SKULLBOARD is using the easy connector which can't handle 30A and Diyeboard doesn't? What do you think? @Hummie ?

I took it out for a spin last night after 24hrs of cure time. ZERO difference in vibrations.. But a slightly quieter ride during CARVING.. (whereas before, the collapsing of air holes on the warm wheels made a crap ton of noise.. cornering with a flat'ish tire)

This morning, I also tested the newly filled holes of the front wheels on my Avenue suspension setup, in hopes that there would be SOME reduction of vibration...I'm bummed to report that this was not the case. :( 
My wheels must be severely imbalanced.. When i crouched next to the skullboard s1 and simply rolled it back and forth with my hand, I could see the nose of the board shake LEFT AND RIGHT.   I CANT GET RID OF THESE VIBRATIONS...

I honestly don't think doing a DIY tread fill is going to be viable afterall.
permatex 27037 is going to be too "soft" for the exterior tread fill. for testing purposes maybe.. 
but It's not going to hold up against any form of asphalt for very long.. It'll tear up pretty easily on the outside of the tire like that... It'll work fine to fill in all the holes,, but that's not where the major vibration is coming from after all. :/

why any motor has a current max I wonder.   the only real reason in my mind would relate to the maximum magnetic strength that could be supported by the stator.  magnetic strength produced by the stator will increases linearly with increasing amps (based on the kv and kt)  up to the point the stator starts to saturate and then the current isn't producing much more magnetic field.

I don't remember the actual connectors but 20a limit on a connector seems very low.  maybe you could add some electrical paste or something at least.   best test would be to see if they're getting hot.   and even if a connector were rated for 20 amps it's probably a continuous rating and burst of much more should be ok.

I am barely started with building the board, but what I have observed that it is freely rollling w/o any weight on the board but rolling resistance increases when I stand on it. I can definitely feel the vibration when I try to move on it. I have got some flexible epoxy that I was thinking of coating the tires with, but seems like it doesn't work, so maybe I won't try it anymore.

Another thing to note is that diyeboards list the motor for these temperatures:

* Maximum Heat ‚Äì 50-60¬∞C, Max 80¬∞C / 122-140¬∞F, Max 176¬∞F
* Voltage ‚Äì 6S-10S   24-42V

And and this power:

* Rated Power ‚Äì 500W per motor
* Max Current ‚Äì 30A

the most flexible decks in the world can't help these hubs, friends.  

per my original review, I do not think anything can.  these hubs are simply not suited to smooth pavement.

my Skullboards hubs (front and rear) are for sale, if anyone would like to try them for a suitable project (they're very well-suited for a friction bike).

half of whatever they cost is fine, and happy to consider trades.

Guys, about the vibrations, what is the frequency of those ? I mean, if the frequency is in the same order of magnitude than the RPM of the wheels, it is most likely a balancing issue. If the frequency is higher it might be caused by the thread pattern.  And if it is lower than the RPM, could be some oscillation induced by the holes/rebound on certain surface types ... 
Also, take a look at the process FPV drone racers use to balance their motors and propellers, it would be nice to try to apply this technique to wheels balancing !

Made a bit of progress on getting these pulleys on and finished.

I've had to drill the hubs so that I can bolt through and secure the pulley adapter, I also gave them a spin and polish whilst i was at it (the factory finish of the aluminium is pretty rough)

![20181010_085847|690x335](upload://zziNAqvELgatLClBbFFPaEHl6qi.jpeg) 

And the rear where the pulley adapter bolts to (like mentioned above, machined flat to accept the adapter)

Finally, I got about all infos.

Ownboard have plan to sell same one of StormESK8. And they improved the surface pattern and changed core from original diyeboard one (that Skullboard sold first ). 

Original

They say the reason of vibration issue is surface pattern that looks like ‚ÄúA‚Äù. So they changed that (looks like bacon wrapped ) ![image|375x500](upload://r7TfuidhWRdYhE7Z59uBYRmDK93.jpeg) 

Which one did you get the information about vibration issue? ‚ÄúA‚Äù or bacon?

Hey bud, welcome.  

Speaking as someone who has also tried to make these tires work:

* "A-Type" (copycat Michelin bike tread) is only useful for rough pavement and dirt trails, underneath a zero-flex deck.  I think Ownboard is approaching their own 'Verreal AT' moment and will be inundated with RMAs on that release.
* "Bacon-type", I am told, are "much more improved", "much less loud" and "loss 15% range/top speed".

We are waiting for @DAddYE's review, yet FWIW, I think these will be adequate. 

The video shows the contact patch is smooth and centered (for now).  

When that raised contact patch wears down, the siping of the tire will be exposed to the surface of the road and some vibration will return.  

Rubber tires will always perform best on heavier, stiff platforms, like the Mini X.

Hope this helps.

Did somebody managed to take the motors apart?
unfortunately I managed to tear some of the cables while testing :frowning_face: 

The holding screw was losening without me noticing and then the cables wund up and teared them self. 
I got a picture but there is something wrong about uploading pictures...

Before destroying one motor I made some tests and here my results (used 1 motor on K2 Kickboard Cruiser (RWD, FW 110mm K2) with Flipsky 6.6 and 12S Multistar 10Ah):

* whole sensorport does work with the flipsky adapter

* temp readings are either off or the sensor is really terribly placed (also a reason to open the motor, replace sensor to one with known beta)

* sensored FOC looses sync with anything over 20A motor current (happening at ~15% duty)
* sensored BLDC doesnt loose sync with any settings (testet up to 40A motor current, then the flaw happend)
* sensored BLDC is really loud
* single motor and (scooter + rider) 75kg is

1. below 15A not really driveable

1. 15-25A reasonable if you kickstart, can get scary fast (even light hills ~10%), but needs it runtime

1. .>25A gets scary powerfull/fast for a scooter with 110mm wheels but also quite hot, unfortunately the ACManiac tool didnt record my motor temp readings (they were off anyway, but comparing the pitch at different motor currents would have been interesting), just from feeling with my hands after ~2mins at trashing at 30A motorcurrent it was something around 60C.

Did somebody managed to take the motors apart?
[/quote]

Ok, wasn't that difficult:
![20181021_104010|690x388](upload://6IT98JbPys9IohVpB74878H9Yi0.jpeg) 
That's my broken motor. 

I opened all visible screws and noticed the cover on the side of the cable slightly turning. Pulled it then apart with a screwdriver. To get of the cover from the stator (with the bearing on the cover) I put it into the freezer and pulled it apart this morning. Due to the higher thermal expansion of the aluminium I was able to take it of just with my fingers (tired I with screwdriver the day before, but did't want to come off).
![20181022_125109|690x388](upload://BBOuATzuTcewKtTJtYd7Nk9FmJ.jpeg)

* Star winding
* 28 Magnets, calculated a KV of 62 
* the screws on the outer side only hold the "skullboard" cover, but the holes are reaching inside. So if you want to get rid of it, fill the screw holes afterwards
* the NTC is only on the hall PCB and only connected to the stator by the 3 hall sensors, so really bad placement if you want to know winding/stator temperature (I am more afraid of burning the windings than destroying the magnets)

Bought these wheels from @diyeboard. Having the same issues as @evopanop where the initial acceleration doesn't work if you gun it using the wowgo ESC. It also consumes a battery pretty fast and doesn't have a high top end (maybe 20mph). Going to wait for the Flipsky dual VESC to try and see what I can fix. I do like the size and material of wheels as going over sidewalk cracks is much nicer. Does have a vibration from the "A" pattern in the wheel but I don't mind it.

For the sake of science, I've also ordered and just received a set of wheels from StormEsk8. 
They definitely don't rattle as much as the Skullboards ones, but they do require some vast effort to push along. I guess there's no magic, if it's soft, it's inefficient, and urethane would always be a winner on good surfaces. 

I got the nice surprise to see bearings, spacers and speed rings provided, despite me being a cheap ass and selecting the "No Bearings" option, and saving 20 bucks in the process. 
But saying so, I think the core of the wheel has been milled a bit too large on one side as there's a pretty loose fit for the bearing. Whether this creates or not alignment issues is yet to be seen.

Also the wheels didn't really appear too sexy in the pack, but a simple wipe of the core gave the aluminium the shine it deserved. There are some minor imperfections at the interface rubber/core, but I guess it's just the way the rubber creates small shards instead of a smooth cut when machined.

The holes in the core would make it pretty straightforward to adapt a pulley of some sorts, easier than for the Skull. I had one lying around from the Hobbyking pulleys/belt set and the holes didn't line up, I guess it would have been pure luck. I imagine they match the Boosted ones, though. 

I think that would work as a cheap acceptable solution for mixed terrain, provided the board isn't underpowered to start with  (and definitely not human-powered!), due to the softness robbing a significant amount of efficiency. The benefit is a care-free ride on shitty roads, gravels and pavement patchworks that are still plentiful in the cracked city I call home.

Can anyone recommend a VESC and remote combo to move my complete stock Skullboard s1 over to? 
To preface, this will be my FIRST experience with vesc and tuning. Please be kind :) 

And yes, i will do alllll the reading! Im currently in the "New VESC user?" thread (There are sooooo many other individual threads regarding vesc, i'm overwhelmed by all the different avenues and version numbers of hardware!) 

My jump to VESC from the stock skullboard esc is in hopes of gaining better torque, acceleration, and battery life. Also to address battery issues, i've already recently acquired a 12s2p torqueboards slim battery and enclosure - which will need a proper vesc to jump to.

Has anyone tried the skullboard hubs with 12s?  

Is there a dual vesc and remote combo anyone would suggest buying and trying for a newbie!?

Here is where i'm torn.. My skullboard wheels/hubs are so riddled with vibration at low speeds, i wonder if it's even worth it to "upgrade" all the surrounding components.. But the half of my thinking is - well, Ill learn some stuff -and have a vesc + battery for future builds. (Any excuse we can think of right, gang?) hahahah

I also am going to be switching to the Flipsky 4.2 dual with the Skullboard hubs and wheels.  The combination with my super stiff aluminum board works great with my 185lbs on smooth concrete/smooth brick boardwalk at taming the ride compared to 90mm PU hubs.

I was debating the change of the connectors, but I really have no choice since my combo didn't come with adapters, rather the connectors on the ESC are short, and buried under waterproofing.  It will be simpler to de-solder the connectors from the motors and change them to bullets and JST for the sensors than to chop the wires coming out of the ESC and hope to reuse them.

I too notice vibration when starting up, but it goes away for me at around 10mph.

I already have the motors opened up.  I was going to remove the connectors from the hall sensor PCB where they are currently soldered on, and simply solder on new, longer, appropriately gauged phase wires and sensor wires, and heat-shrink the lot.  The opening for the wire in the enclosure already has a grommet.

The part that sucks is that the sensor wires need to be longer than the phase wires because of where they connect on the Flipsky VESC, otherwise spaghetti.

@DAddYE @boramiNYC @rey8801 Hey guys I got these wheels and tried with a wowgo ESC. It had problem starting off, maybe what you call cogging? It also would brake at top speed and that was scary as hell!

I then got the cheaper Flipsky dual VESC. Been trying to follow along to emulate the same settings as y‚Äôall but having issues still with the cogging at take off. I think I‚Äôve solved the other issues I was having. Any advice on getting the sensors working? Seems like that could fix it. I did re-wire mine to match the 6-pin but can‚Äôt get the VESC software to pick it up. Any advice there?

Hi the oggi g problem during the start up can be fixed with a sensored motor. For the worong every motor type is different but you usually have up to 6 wires. The important one for position are 3. Temp, 5V and GND. The rest are for the hall sensors and doesn't matter the order. What I usually do it to see the position on the original jst Zh and match it with the order you have on the vesc. Most of the time red is 5V, black ground and yellow temp but can be different. Be aware thst some sensored motors are difective and for instance I have a hub motor (one side) were the sensored part doesn't work.
To me what is weird that you have the full brake at to speed. Clogging can be solved if you push the board for take off, the other issue is really dangerous.

The brake at full speed was with wowgo esc. I‚Äôm using [Flipsky Dual FSESC 4.12](https://flipsky.net/products/dual-fsesc4-12-100a) and haven‚Äôt had it do that yet. I‚Äôll play around with wires on the 105mm hub motors and the ESC to see if I can get the software to pick up on the sensors. Probably should have tried that before I soldered them together! lol... I just tried catching colors.

Oh and these 105mm wheels seem to NOT use the white wire even though it‚Äôs in the wiring hardness. I got the wheels from diyeboard.

colours were never correct for me. You should find the hall sensor order on the Wowgo esc (suppose that it worked there). Otherwise try the combination I told you before. Red 5v and black GND, yellow (some times white) Temp. Usually temp is next to the 5V on the vesc. Anyhow you should see written the pin order on the vesc. One thing you can do is to take the previous jst zh connector that you cut out. Maybe you still have short wires attached. Based on that you can try to see if it already matches the vesc order, in that case simply give the same order at the new ones, no matter the colours as long they go to the same pin position.

I have yet to ride airless tires (I pick my spending battles carefully). It's a cool idea in theory. And on a hub motor, also. But no factory in china seems they can build good hub motors, unless it's designed by someone outside of china and then just made there (like the raptor 2 hubs). It's hard to understand what you need in it if your not an e-skater yourself. For this price, I wouldn't have high hopes. It seem's like they cheaped out on the quality of materials (you'd have to to go this low).

Do you still have the old jst? Maybe you can take a picture and compare it with the position on 5he vesc. Because you talk about matching the colors, but I meant match the pin order. Maybe in your new jst PH (VESC compatible) the color are exactly the same but it's weird that both of the detection doesn't work. You can also simply try to measure with a volt meter the 5v and gnd pond and see if the 5v direction is correct. So if you place the red probe on the 5v and the black probe on the gnd you should read a positove value (of course motor power on). If you read a negative one than the pin order is not correct and in this case reversed. If you don't read anything then one of the two is either not 5v or GND.

 I was in the process of experimenting when I inadvertently realized it was going to be a failure.

I still have a pair of 90mm hub motors that work fine, but they‚Äôre a little rough to ride because they have no cushion, The hub motors are exactly the same as the Skullboard ones, just with different outsides. I was hoping at the end to have the motors hooked up to as FSESC 4.2 so that if necessary, I could adjust settings between the wheels, and change the outside of the hub motor at will (well, maybe not THAT easy).

Turns out that while the hub motors are essentially the same (stator teeth, pole count, windings look the same), the aluminum shaft is machined and mounted differently. I can still make it work, but I‚Äôll need to place washers on the shaft to not allow the motor to shift laterally between the bearings.

Moral of the story: while the Skullboard motors/wheels may appear to be essentially copies of other motors with a similar design, you can‚Äôt use all ‚Äúparts‚Äù as ‚Äúreplacements‚Äù

oohhh i gotcha.. You stripped the skullboard hubs.. took the tires and stuck them to your meepo sleeves?
Did you have to also strip the thane off of the meepo sleeves? or did you just stretch the tire over it? 
What kind of adhesive? Any more pics of the process?? Also still trying to figure out your hanger setup.

Yup stripped the skullboard Motor, swappable meepo v2 hubs (no need to strip the pu). Landyatch foam griptape was also a good investment. Liquid nails fuse it (adhesive), fused it. Dirt, Ice, gravel, grass is in the past![IMAG2728|666x500](upload://hP7bn8EtokzPuVwT5Cxy0hTfR1v.jpeg)

Since I had already bought these hubs I had to find a way to remove the vibrations. I used automotive PU adhesive that is used for sticking glass to frame to fill in the tread pattern. This is the end result. 
![20181211_002227|243x500](upload://ykA6GUH41LzpCbMkRnOy6JaQiLn.jpeg) 

I will be testing these soon and I have high hopes that this will be enough. Might also reduce the rolling resistance.
If this is not enough then I will do another layer on top of this.

Dude, you bought these wheels for the extra rubber traction. By adding pu adhesive, you're turning those nice tires back to regular skate wheels. Trust me on my mod these things carve great, so crazy I can carve on gravel now confidently (at your own risk).  The vibrations are not from the wheels, its the Motors locking up & restarting every half sec or so. Temp sensor maybe, but those Motors are definitely undersized.

The vibrations ARE from the wheels! I have them on a unmotorized board (yet), and there is definitely annoying vibrations in there. More annoying is the resistance to roll, though... Energy frugality is definitely not part of the specs for those wheels!

These motors are used in multiple boards including carvon a version of meepo, koowheel and a few others. none of them have vibrations. No to mention I could feel the vibrations even when just rolling unpowered. 
After quick test I think I can say I got rid of most vibration caused by the tread pattern. I want to test the range today as well to see if there is an improvement but I don't have any previous figures to compare it with. So I guess it won't be very helpful. A more complete review coming soon.

Ok yes I can feel  very minor vibrations from kick pushing, anything below 8mph you will  feel some of the thread pattern. Anything above 8mph doesn't bother at all, it maybe because we're on two different set ups. But the main reason I got rid of my Motor was because 1.they are weak, not enough torque 2. Sluggish acceleration (even on expert mode) 3. They consume a lot of energy (2mile range) for nothing. I popped my meepo Motors in, got my torque/range(14miles) back just more traction. Good luck not damaging your batteries with those things

So I went on a 3 mile ride. Here's a full review of these wheels without any vibration problems. 
Vibrations from wheel thread are completely gone. I used this leftover PU adhesive I had to resurface the wheels, so I did not spend extra to do this but if you plan to do this there is a black one available for cheaper.
https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FW61EW/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1
**Range:**
After the PU conversion on a 10s3p 30Q 9Ah battery these wheels will give me about 15 miles range if I am going slow about 10 mph average with some hills mixed in. Not that great results considering you'll lose more range if you are going at higher speeds.  
**Power**
I am using 2 focboxes in sensored FOC and 20A Battery Amp and 40A motor Amp. As people have noticed the torque is fairly bad and these motors heat up quickly. After just 3 miles and 1 hill these motors became uncomfortably hot to touch. Which makes me think 20A really is the max you should put in them.
**Hills** It'll be a slow climb on most hills greater then 10%. If you have a long and steep hill these hubs will likely stall after a while
**Comfort** Well now that the vibrations are gone these should be comfortable right? Well... maaaaaybe, if the roads are not too bad near you these will be comfortable for the most part. However i am not going to take these on shit roads as they feel about as comfortable as 107's to me, so it feels like you are loosing all that range for nothing. 
**Conclusion:** Not that powerful and a mediocre range and ride at best, these don't compare to true Pneumatics. However out of all the hub motors these are probably the best and most comfy ride you will find at least after you take care of the vibrations.

When I swapped my Meepo hubs for the Skullboard motors, the range dropped 50% with my Sanyo 10s2p. I can still get 10 km out of them, but I kick start and don't hit that many hills on my daily rides. I've got other boards in the works, but these will be sticking around for their versatility.

I hope the Skullboard folks take another whack at this and release a 2.0 version.

Have you ever ridden a 83mm centrax wheel? It feels the same as that, very similar formula and also poured by ande.

First, comes down to the diameter of the motor. Hummie hubs are far thinner than most hub motors. This means you get more thane for your size...

Then, comes the quality of the wheel. I feel safe taking hummie hubs over pretty much anything (as you'll see in the Barrett Junction Race in just over a month). Low duro, soft 78a wheels make a huge difference.

From the those who have ridden them, they all say the same thing: They can't believe how smooth they feel, and that it feels similar to a 107mm wheel.

Come to a major event soon and ride them. I think it'll change your mind about larger wheel size == more comfort. ;)

```
The vibration does NOT come from the tread... It is from the imbalanced mounting of the tires. 
Get down next to your board and just roll it back and forth with your hand slowly - Can you feel/observe the deck swinging or swaying? That issue isn't solved by filling in the tread - and that issue is really where the problem lies. 

Another test you can do.. simply cover the surface of your wheels with Heavy Duct Tape or something similar to mimic a smooth tire... and get down next to your board to slowly roll it back and forth with your hands again...The tire imbalance, if present, will still produce the same "swaying" in your deck. (I don't recommend actually riding your board like this..) 

Regarding filling all the micro holes of the airless design, I did this already and it didn't fix the heavy vibration issues - But it did make carving and cornering sound/feel different. The available outer membrane of the airless tire is very thin - and under weight, it's basically like carving with a semi flat tire. Not efficient and pretty noisy. Filling the holes all the way through helps the tire keep its firmness under heavy weighted turning. 

Also, there isn't a level of consistency through the mounting process from wheel to wheel, so different people are having different results it seems.

I really want to try rewinding these motors.  After finding all the information on how to do it, I'm still hesitant to take the motor apart to count the # of turns it has before starting.

Someone on rcgroups helped me make the calculations and the recommendation was to go with 8 turns of 18 AWG.  I've ordered the wire and now just need to look into replacing the hall sensors since I'll likely need to hack out the originals.

Seeing the PCB APS sells, I wonder if its better to have the sensors 120 degrees apart, or just the 3 of them in a 120 degree spread like they are on this motor by default.  If I can't figure out the sensor to get replacements, I'll have no choice but to desolder the originals from the PCB, work around them for the rewire, then solder them back in.  I tried softening the epoxy to get them out on a throw away motor, but that didn't work out.  I ended up having to chisel them out with a screwdriver and rubber mallet.

Anyone know how to get just replacement hall sensors? Can I just buy the APS ones and solder them in instead of the originals?

Fyi they are wound with 0.30mm wire, x10, 16T (still not sure on this terminology, but I mean 8 turns on the first tooth CW, another 8 on the next tooth CCW, skip 4 teeth, etc), wye termination, dLRK wound.

My 90mm Maxfind motors were 12T of bundle of 14 of the same wire, but were MUCH more fun to ride.  Incidentally, doing the math I found that the Maxfind iteration had way better efficiency than the Skullboard version.  No wonder this version has such poor performance.

I'm actually aiming to increase the efficiency from the Maxfind version. The rewire is on!

I tried the skullboard wheels on their own but with the Verreal generic ESC. I learnt quickly that the ESC needs to be programmed to the spec of the wheel. As a result of the mismatch I got cogging on take off (not smooth takeoff like the original wheels). Once going the wheels worked fine. The top speed was much lower than my original wheel and not as much torque. Also under load with the incorrect ESC there is some cutting out that goes on that never happens with the correctly matched wheels.
I took apart the Skullboard wheel and the original Verreal wheel and the skullboard stator is smaller in diameter and length than the verreal wheel. The skullboard also has a larger number of windings.
In summary I wanted a powerful board to be able to go uphill on grass. I combined my original setup with the skullboard wheels and together it is fast and powerful but due to these generic ESCs not being programable it is a hit and miss when you start combining parts with limited data on them.

I just ripped off the old PU off the original hubs and machined the Rough Stuff wheels to slide onto the outer hub. It works fine because the Rough stuff wheels have so much meat on the outside that there is no problem just having a tight interfearance fit. Everything stays tight. You need that meat as having thin outer PU tends to loose shape after a while. The wheels are not as true as I would like them to be but it does not really matter for the ride.
I had some guy do the machining who had never done it before and it was a learning process for him. But for someone who knows how to machine PU it is easy. You need to make the carbide cutter into a particular shape to get it to cut PU nicely. Also if I would do the machining I would have also machined the outside of the diecast sleeve to true it up. I would do it again, I just thought at the time that the Skull board wheels would work out but they didn't. In saying that I have plenty of power now in 4wd to get thru most grassy parks and hills. If I had all 4 wheels like the Rough stuff setup then it would be perfect. Might do it again if no other big 105-110mm turn up to market.

I did. The are 350w. I spun them up on bldc sensorless because the sensor wires connectors were silly. Used some old 4.xs I had kicking around. 20a battery max for the both of them. 

Tiny motor leads but ran smoother than I expected. Rode it in hallway, project for a buddy.

For those who reported the vibration issues, I'd like to point out that now that I've worked with 2 sets of motors and wheels, I've found most of them to be cut off center.  This makes the wheel/motor imbalanced, and I'm sure would cause vibrations while spinning.  You may want to take a look at yours to see if this is your case as well.

I had to use large strips of lead tape (for balancing tennis racquets) to correct it.

can you please elaborate?  like, how did you locate the counter balance point?

i got a set from @mishrasubhransu, they're wobbly as fuck.

Its the same method for balancing RC tires and propellers: You let the heavy side settle to the bottom on its own, then stick tape to the top.  With the 105 wheels its easy since the rim is completely hollowed out.  You keep doing this until the wheel when spun doesn't settle with the same heavy spot at the bottom any more.  Ideally, what used to be the heavy spot, and your new taped spot end up at 3 and 9 o'clock.

How about the bearings? They‚Äôre a little loose. I tried to tape them around and push them but at some point it will lose the tape.

In my case, I had one front wheel that the spacer was a little too big so the bearings did not sit completely in the hub.  Even with the nut tightened, you could move the wheel side to side.  This I fixed by sanding down the spacer until the bearings would sit correctly.

Unfortunately, these wheels are far from "precision made".

If in your case the bearing is loose from the hole being too big diameter, I don't know what to do to fix that.  Even though the price of one wheel is cheap, shipping will kill the idea of buying a single replacement.

I have  vibration issue on the Skullboard hubs also. I thought it was the bearings and was going to replace them but I think I need to check the trueness of the hubs first. I didn't like these hubs from the start. I have a 4wd setup with the skullboards hubs up front and the verreals up back. I do notice that the Skullboards do run much cooler than the verreals but the skullboards are less powerful and exhibit some other issues a little bit hard to explain but wheels skips under high power on grass surfaces which is anoying. The verreals don't do this

Thank you! for the citizen science  
  
Edit: Ahh okay - second thread already for this https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/rewinding-90mm-hub-motor/80491 
  
How did you do with the franken-hubs?:o  
I have the same Maytech 90mm 65kV 800W @ 36v rated motors, but there are mixed reviews everywhere<:P

I'm also planning casting my own various types and sizes of hub motors with different composite mixtures - it will either suck not bad, or will be a total shitshow :P time tells

I feel like they are good/good+ with the rewind, but I won't likely ever do it again :stuck_out_tongue: When I did it for the second time with sensors and 15 turns/2x21AWG the result was quite nice.  Top speed of 25mph, no overheating, great efficiency (way better than the stock Skullboard motors, I got 25 miles out of a 4P Samsung 30Q pack), but I kick started most often cause it doesn't have enough torque to get me going quickly given the weight of the board is 25lbs and I'm another 185.

I was thinking of doing another round with a few more turns (18) and seeing what I got, but nah.

@turbotrana

How did you get the skick revolutions wheels on the hubs?
Did you just manually drill through it?

If anyone decides to test these out, please share results.

I went another route:
