I don’t own a trampa and never tried those barrels but It looks like these which probably have more feedbacks as they have been around longer

If there was one upgrade that I’d suggest to every Trampa Vertigo / Infinity owner, it would be Trampa Barrels, hands-down. 

To me, they feel better than any combination of springs with Dampas and way, way better than MBS’ vague return (yellows).

Most importantly, they’re solid at 30 MPH, as @Trdolan03 said.

To make it clear. Although I own the Trampa barrels, I am still building the battery for my board so I have no experience on how they work.
I saw on Trampa's website that they should be installed in the truck's inner position and would also like to know how you guys have them installed.

Why exactly? I've used springs in the inner position, worked great. Is the wobble reduced that much by using barrels? How easy it is to steer compared to with the springs?
Kind of a shame the you're forced to buy a whole truck along with the barrels...

The e-toxx?
I have no idea. I don't know if they are the same as the Trampa ones.

It is my understanding that the barrels are an industrial product and were first used instead of springs by e-toxx. Now Trampa also supplies the same barrels. I could be wrong though.

Whether they are better than springs, I do not know. I don't have enough riding time on both to come to a valid conclusion and even if I did, setup preferences are highly personalized.

The elastomere is the same (also same shore) I guess from the same german company because @Duffman posted the link 1-2 years ago. 

But the retainers are different. Trampa uses M5 on bottom and top retainers. E-Toxx retainers have 2 threads and the top ones are mounted with M8 like springs into the thread of the baseplate not with M5 through the M8 hole. Furthermore they are adjustable like springs.

For someone who is getting into the EMTB scene, and wouldnt know better, the Trampa seem to be the more alluring option due to price, and lack of having to adjust(?). (also for my build, I will have a little plate covering the top of the board where my hardware will be, the thinner the holes the better, imo )

True, but we figured out that you can use the regular adjuster from the coil spring system. 
If you want to use M8 grub screws in the top retainer, mounting the barrels gets more painful. You can't slide them in from the side... 
BTW: It is quite easy to modify the top retainer if needed. Just drill out the M5 thread and cut a M8.
A simple M8 thread cutter will do the job.

We use the barrels without pre-tension. Winding in the adjuster, putting permanent pressure on the barrels, will damage them. Thy typical use case for these springs is riding trails and urban environments. In that case you want the board to turn with more ease, while being relative stable at speed. Non of our riders really use them with pre-tension. If they want a stiffer setup, they all go for coil springs with Dampas.

I released all information regarding these elastomers in this forum in 2017 and in the german forum in 2016, so there are no secrets about this product:

https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/4wd-heavy-duty-offroad-monster-board-vesc-c6364-sensored-12s30ah-10kw/20783/35?u=duffman

https://www.elektro-skateboard.de/forums/topic/4089-mbs-pro-90-4x-vescntm5060-12s/?do=findComment&comment=36589

We were riding a few prototypes of these since then and @Nowind and I decided at some point that we should make a product out of it. As you can see on the images, we also started with round retainers but they are hard to remove if you apply loctite to the screws. Therefore we went with hexagon shaped retainers to give you the possibility to use a wrench to unscrew these.

Unfortunately this is an extra production step and makes the product more expensive. As we order only small quantities, produced in Germany everything sums up to a higher product price than Trampa.

You have to decide for yourself if the R&D, the added features and the extra color options is worth the money.

And I believed trampa’s Elastomer is little bit longer than Etoxx’s as I’ve owned etoxx’s and currently on trampa’s. I love trampa’s on normal road condition but on the other hand etoxx’s was better off-road. Maybe due to the diff in length (i could be wrong tho)

@Trampa How is it you think adding preload damages the elastomer?
I'm actually running a split set up with springs up front, drilled yellow dampas, elastomers on the rear, all on the inside position with a small amount of preload. The handling is sublime with this set up, and it took me a good while to get to this configuration. I'm finding the small amount of rear preload, only about 2mm, gives a nice positive centering force.

2mm is probably not a big deal. Andy Brind put 7-8mm on them and they took some damage. Being the World Champion in Mountain boarding, he is probably not the scale.....
2mm should be fine. That is like a thick washer in between the retainer and the Baseplate.

Ah, I can see how that type of abuse could do it. I was a bit worried you were seeing some other type of damage caused by using the preload adjusters, as it says on the product page you loose the adjustment when fitting these. Good to know it's ok once you don't over do it.

Setup is a matter of personal preference and terrain. Hard to give general advice. 
I ride with springs and green Dampas in the back and without Dampas in front. Springs in outside position.
Front without pre-tension, back with some pre-tension. 
I do not go very fast and in consequence I get away with a loose front.
I aslo ride with barrels, front and back, no pre-tension.

On the carvers I drop the springs in inner position, but with dampas in back and no dampas in front. I ad like 4-5mm pre-tension on the springs ( which is needed on the carvers).
For city usage I ride without Dampas and springs in inner position, 5mm pre-tension.

Hey Frank,

Sounds like you and I run with a similar spring/damp setup. Personally I've not had any stability issues on springs at 55-60+ kph but am always interested in testing limits here.

Have you found any limitations with the barrels in terms of pushing speed? I'm going to pickup a set to play with but curious on yours and others experiences with these at 60+kph.

Of course!

I change my configuration often, but:

Drivetrain- I've got two gear drive carvers that I ride the most, both 4:1 gear drive on 170-190KV motors. 8" pneumatics usually, but also have 7" Inlines, 6.5" Urban treads, and Gummies I've been playing with. 10S6P and a 12S Lipo pack. 

Deck- I have a LaCroix Prototipo deck that's my daily rider, alt is a Holypro35. On my LC Prototipo I usually just run stock 30/30 but have been testing with 30/24 recently. Holypro35 I usually keep at 35/30. 

Spring/damps - For speed builds lately I've been running 4x red damps but recently pulled the front damps out and haven't really been impacted noticeably from hitting top speed. It helps that my riding weight is about 102kg, so I can still throw my weight into the board to turn even on stiffer damp setups. 

.... I also ride with full protective gear. The parental guilt is real.

Unfortunately I have not been able to play enough with my Trampa.

The weather has not been good enough to hit any of the trails I have in mind plus I first want to get comfortable with it on road and make sure it is as reliable as possible before I take it on a trail and end up having to tow a 18kg monster for 5km.

So far my impressions are that the barrels are more stable on road while having a lot more turnabily when used in the inner position.

Springs with green dampas set on the outer position feel more wobbly when I hit a bump on the road at speed making them more scary. Keep in mind I have not tried any preload so far and that my Trampa is geared for torque thus having a top speed of around 45km/h.

The funny thing is that while the barrels feel more stable at speed when I go off road the springs feel more stable as the board does not want to turn on its own when going over ruts etc. Plus it feels better when landing jumps.

I have a lot more tuning to do and I was hoping that I could get some information on where to start.

I don't need this board to be dead stable at 60km/h (I have my Evo for that) as it was bought to be used mostly off road.

My guess is you will love them for on road.

Considering your weight you could probably be able to use them in the outer position or at least outer in the rear and inner in the front to get a very stable but turnable board.

Rad. Thanks for the tips! 

I also ride my carvers in motorcycle boots, the heel on them makes for great additional leverage on turns and you can hook it on the edge of your deck as needed. I can feel an immediate difference when I jump on one with my vans on. 

There's nothing more hilarious than watching someone lighter try to turn my 4x damp setup under 25km/h. Like a boat adrift at sea. Hah

Maximum steering!! My only issue is how many times I have to jump to turn tight corners. I used the barrels last night. Amazing stability on top speed. 
Absolutely no vibrations and the ride is way smoother. I used to get bad wobbles on bumps going 30 mph cause my setup is pretty loose but no more. 

However I did not notice a significant improvement in turning. I still have to lift the front of my board to make most turns >70°

Thanks for the advice. I was able to drill the holes. It was quite easy to drill through. You were damn right about the steering. My turning radius has been reduced by almost half!!
I still haven't taken it to full speed but now if I lean far enough I fall over lol.
