So I went out and got wasted last night, got home at 4 am and set my alarm for the next dayâ€™s class at 8 am. Somehow I told Siri to set the alarm to 8pm instead and when I woke up, it was already 8.53. Class starts at 9 and I got up, brushed my teeth and grabbed my stuff and helmet. Left the house at 9. Normally it would take me a little over half an hour by public transport to my tutorâ€™s office which is about 6 km away but with my raptor 2, got there in less than 10 minutes. Saved myself from a huge ass whooping by her...

Best piece of equipment Iâ€™ve ever purchasedðŸ‘Œ Donâ€™t think I couldâ€™ve gotten there so fast with my own boards because a. Theyâ€™re in another country b. Not build for speedðŸ˜…

Mines almost exactly the same, but I have to walk another 15 minutes after taking the bus. This is why I hate rainy days so much

Same here, from home to work 20 minutes by car without traffic, plus parking which is a nightmare. Pubblic transportation is fine but still 25 minutes if you get all the coincidents. With electric skateboard 15 minuts of surfing plus the pleasure :sunglasses:...

I live in a mobile home park with a community dumpster. 
I use my Eboard to carry the garbage down the hill to the dumpster.

I do this with 6 packs... Although the thought of building a Mad Max style tanker trailer(keg) has crossed my mind a couple times... Lol

I am using a light wagon, so I can put my big ass german shepherd in it and haul her around.  She can carry my beer too :slight_smile:

Still building it. I just got a universal joint threaded to 3/8-24 so I can use some steel rods to make the connections. I'll post when it's complete.
