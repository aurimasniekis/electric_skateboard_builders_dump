Hey there guys and galls!

Up until now I've been doing mostly this
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/f/3/f316fd357dd81513a3434079b8e5dda01c1606c2.jpg" width="690" height="460">
and on various urban terrain within the city: bike routes, roads, pavements, lawns, mild off-road paths, rarely forest and some more serious up/downhill proper bumpy off-road.

And now im about to get my first Trampa and am between two minds whether to get a MOUNTAINBOARD or URBANCRUISER setup...

There's also the question of carbon ply-count: I'm a solid 70kg and haven't gone anywhere with this weight for ages now. Height is 173cm. I also have a permanent ankle injury and my knees tend to ache under to much vibration-stress. The plan is also to make a flexible segmented roadside enclosure, smth like @whitepony 's or @Kaly style, which will prbbly stiffen the deck slightly... I'm guessing 14ply would be okay (after @whitepony here: https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/trampa-street-urban-carver-whatcha-think-yay-or-nay/17067/82). But that's a guess since I've got no previous experience and no place to try it out prior to purchase?

Thanks in advance and please relegate me to a similar thread if this has been already discussed, I failed to find any tho, hence I'm writing this.

i find 14ply just about right for street carving, felt a little stiff at first, even with enclosure ... but after I tuned the truck springs, Im happy with that now (my weight is 82kg).

also had a 15ply mountain board and it couldnt have been thinner for rought terrain, because you use the flex to jump higher and it can easily bottom out on landings ... which you probably dont want with a roadside mounted enclosure!

so in the end its about what you want to do with the board. carving? 14ply! rough terrain? 15ply+

So I do know urban cruiser is the way to go. I'll do a mountainboard later to do some more serioius trails.

Thanks to @whitepony for the answer. But I'm still not sure about it since I'm exactly 10kg less than you, and so would I still bottom out on a jump of a kerb? 

So the question of ply-count sorta remains... Could you please have a say, too, @trampa ? I'd love you're expertise on that as well:
da raw data on meself:
weight: 72/73kg
height: 173cm
riding style: various urban terrain within the city: bike routes, roads, pavements, lawns, mild off-road paths, WITH jumps on/off the pavement kerb, (since in Poland noone seems to have came up with the idea of not putting large, edgy kerbs on bike route crossings :/ )

I know that I need bindings for the jumps, but - taking into consideration my weight and height - what ply count would I need not to bottom out with my roadside enclosure on one of them kerb-jumps?

15 Ply mate! 14 would be slightly to flexy I guess. Bindings can be mounted, so its a mini MTB. You could also mount the wider hangers and put some 8"ers on later.

That sure seems to be an apt comparison I gotta admit, bro ;) I'm compiling my order in a PM to you as I write this, btw ;)

Ha! Wunderbar! Vielen Dank! :D Aber mein Deutsch ist noch viel schlechter als mein Englisch und ich will das Board so schnell wie möglich kaufen und mit meinem Deutsch wäre es viel schwieriger ;)
