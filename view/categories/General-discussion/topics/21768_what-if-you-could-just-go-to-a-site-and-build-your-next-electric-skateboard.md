I'm building it. I've been talking about it for a year in certain circles, but i've finally almost got it going.

The idea is that you walk through a wizard in which you choose a deck, choose your wheels and bearings, choose your primary and accent colors, type up a breif description of aesthetics, possibly upload some napkin art to better explain what you want, pick your weel pulleys/ratio, and pick your battery pack. 

The first phase won't be very graphically intense but will be very usable and pretty. My ultimate goal is to have 3D models or at least well calculated photographs that can update with your selections for a visual preview of sorts. 

The first phase is almost ready for showtime. I expect to have something to show people within a couple of months. IT will likely be on my current domain but i've registered the  esk8.build domain for it so i have the option of it being a standalone site at some point. 

So far i've moved my shop and blog  to Shopify where they have crazy APIs that let you do things in a pretty awesome environment that makes wordpress and woocommerce look lame af. 

Now i've got some code going that will eventually allow you to build your custom esk8 the same way you build a Dell computer or Bustin pusher. Obviously The Conversation will still be a huge part of it but over time i hope this will eliminate a huge amount of back and forth as well as be able to tie into a ticketing system that will allow me to build more boards in a more organized fashion and do it faster. 

Pardon me while i attempt to turn this esk8 industry on its head.

Makes sense. What you're describing exists for several other industries. The "build your own" tool on most automobile manufacturers website comes to mind. 

I know squat about IT, but I suspect this will require a lot of work to implement with a simple and effective user interface. I hope you're able to monetize your vision and efforts so that you continue to push this industry forward.

If you think you'll need some user-testing, let me know. As long as you have the bandwidth and some decent security for SQL tables and such, you should be in good shape. I'd love to go through some test cases and see how the system reacts to unlikely combinations of requests, input, etc.

i wonder why they didn't go after the .build TLD like i did. Oh well. 

In the original founding spirit of the internet i won't be hanging on to domains i don't actually use. If i decide its not worth it to run those extra domains i'm going to release them.  I'll also consider hosting sites for free on them provided they are doing something constructive with it. 

@kibo I'm using Shopify as my platform, so any holes you find i'm sure they'll like to know about them. I have a feeling i'm going to be pushing the envelope a little on their APIs. 

All i need is for them to shove an arbitrary product with notes into the cart and shoot an extra email at my ticketing system when the sale happens. I may have to write a shopify app to get the level of access i need but i'm hoping i can get away with using the shopping cart's ajax API somehow. 

I'll have something for people in this thread to play with soon. I'm still doing basic styling on the UI before its ready for a non-cart-functional demo.

@longhairedboy oh man this is an awesome idea! I can imagine a systematic ordering system saving you a lot of time. 

It will also give those new to the building process a new way to explore the options, which I think is desperately needed. What do we tell people now, who want to learn about what components to use in a new esk8 build? We tell them to go and read 5,000 threads on the esk8 forum to learn for themselves! I suspect that a lot of people end up with a pre-built esk8 simple to avoid the overwhelming number of options and the steep learning curve associated with building their own.

A site that lists options could really help raise awareness of the choices available, and of course will help generate new builds that come your way! Looking forward to seeing it.

I think it is a downright terrific idea, and if successfully implemented, as you say, would definitely shake up the industry. If it was as huge of a draw as I think it would be, would you be able to keep up with demand? The lack of readily available components seems to be a huge limiting factor in the esk8 world.

my biggest issue right now is not having a build object. I work almost entirely out of emails which is not efficient. The biggest reason i started this project was so i could have the customer help me build an object that could then be linked to the sale, the build, the inventory, the customer, and the ongoing support ticket history over the life of the board. This object would always be the reference for what needs to happen next as it would contain references to every aspect of the build, sale, and ownership of the board. 

Also i want to use this to bring choice to the customer. More than just wheels and colors and battery size. We have a fucton of awesome vendors around here now. There are so many mounts and motors available, variations of VESCs, other ESCs that are based on VESCs, multiple kinds of remotes, and even peripherals like Shredlights and underglow sticks and things like that. 

I'm hoping to allow customers to eventually choose if they want DIY mounts over Enertion style mounts or 5055 motors over 6355 motors or AXLE VESCs or VESC-Xs and let them do some research before choosing. Possibly even save their builds for later. 

but for now i'll be happy just to give them something to play with and see what's possible while allowing them to see exactly what goes into a build and why it costs so much.

@longhairedboy  I think what you are trying to achieve here is a tool called ''Configurator''

Im not sure whenever you will succeed in creating one in the environment you chose (Shopify system?)..

But on a side note, maybe some other smart mind can help you out who deal with these things daily.. maybe @makevoid could give some tips or @rpasichnyk

So yeh, if you in the end manage to get a configurator which even ''compiles'' a 3d image out of the selected parts, that would be really sweet :)

I basically have the interface built already. ITs just a matter of getting it to create something that can then be shoved into Shopify's  shopping cart/ordering system and getting shopify to  see it and treat it like a product so it can be paid for and archived, then get it to trigger a new ticket in my ticketing system somehow. 

Shopify is a hosted ecommerce platform with a shitload of customization capabilities. They wrote their own templating language which is amazing btw and then open sourced it. They have a bunch of APIs and a whole coding environment built into it. ITs crazy. I can't believe i was actually trying to make it on wordpress and woocommerce. That was terrible.

I haven't even tapped the surface yet. Most people just go in, load up some products, pick a theme, and go. And for 99% of the cases, that's great. It automatically provides you with a cross platform shopping experience out of the box, s its quick and easy and done. 

but then there is all the other shit you can do... seriously i thought wordpress was flexible. I've written plugins and themes for it but it was nothing like this. I have found the light.

so i managed to atomize my components and create "invisible" products in shopify that i can then add to the cart individually once the parts are "picked" by the "configurator" and allow the person to have a complete itemized list of everything that goes into the board, including fees and labor, in their cart with a total. 

So now I have to get the javascript written to actually add that shit to the cart, but i'm soooo on the home stretch with this thing. 

this is kind of amazing. Shopify is letting me do whatever the fuck i want basically. 

I have something to play with ready, but i'm so close to having it tied into the cart and actually working that i might hold off on posting the link until its done.

That would be lovely, wou;dn't it? unfortunately the hard reality is that i can't fit 72 cells and 4 vescs in my box, so i'm not setting it up to config all wheel drive boards just yet until i can wire in some conflict resolution. 

to start off its only doing dual rear but i do want to allow alternate configurations eventually such as front wheel drive, all wheel drive, and dual diagonal. 

but i have to start somewhere so i'm starting with what people have been typically ordering from me.

You should offer complete sets of items that aren't build as a package. So someone who wants to DIY but doesn't know enough about the parts to buy can still build the board. And if you offered rough estimates of how fast and far it would go, it'd be awesome.

@longhairedboy if you can.. please make a ''battery size'' drawing tool.. so that people can see the expected range / wattage and other data (like charging info) while choosing the battery size they want (that is, if you gonna offer different sized batteries)!

I see it as a pretty cool feature on how to super quickly estimate how big battery you would like to have.. Ok for longboard guys this is not as a big problem as it is for mountainboard users with more wattage / power needed for cruising around..

Will try to keep track of this little spark I got.. maybe someone already has made something similar..

I know for ebikes someone had made a tool to place 18650 inside of triangle of bicycle.. it was kind of simple yet effective tool to count how many batteries how much space takes up..

mother of god.

 i have complete builds going into the shopping cart now as a list of selected components. 

I'm going to take a break from this for a minute now that its actually somewhat functional yet still rudimentary. It still needs to be polished and there are some things that need to be added in, like Shredlights which will be coming stock with every build thanks to a deal i just made with them, and i still need to wire in some validation for conflicting parts, but here it is. 

I'll let you guys play with it for a minute.  https://longhairedboy.com/pages/esk8-builder

If it suddenly stops working, just remember i'm still in there monkeying around with the code. 
Also i know the images are huge, i'm going to go back and optimize everything for fast loading later. I was just tossing in quickly photoshopped backgrounds to add texture. I hate looking at grey screens while i'm building things.

Pretty sweet. A couple of things I would suggest to tighten it up:

Deck- can't really see all 3 options (Scarlet especially) in the picture the way my browser is looking at it.

Battery- it would be great to understand the weight trade off for these options...either adding it into the choices or adding another function on the left next to the range

Summary- I like seeing the individual fees. The amount of labor (24.5 hours) seems excessive. Maybe because I haven't put the work in on one of your decks like you have. Also I am guessing that although you charge $50 for the deck, you may have some labor costs in there to press and build it. I'd suggest including those costs into the deck rather than having all of the labor in one line.

Great start though. I think it looks great and gets the point across about customizing it.

Definitely not trying to knock what you are doing. I appreciate the fine work that you do. Maybe it's as simple as not breaking it down to an hourly rate and just giving a lump sum labor cost. My initial reaction from reviewing it was thinking that seemed like a lot of time. I think it's similar to going to an auto mechanic and they add those labor costs on. You think to yourself "That did not take you an hour to change the oil and filter."

just an update. I've been working on this when i can which isn't much. I did manage however to add some indication as to which deck you're selecting by providing an image of all three cutouts with text saying what they are. 

also i just added the labor as a fee and dropped the hourly rate calculation. I think that was a good call @NummThumz

also i'm about an inch and a half away from having a pathway for uploading your own deck shapes that you draw yourself so that i can cut it out on the x-carve and you can amaze your friends. 

 I just finished rebuilding my x-carve so that it would have a cutting area ideal for cutting my decks. I added a new waste board, shortened the x-axis, and lengthened the y-axis. Then i put mounting bolt holes where the truck holes go on each of my decks. I press the blank, chop off the excess,  use the template to pre-drill truck holes, then mount it face up on the x-carve. It does the cutout then the wire channels. Bam. 

so if i provide a template with truck bolt holes and box placement as an Illustrator or SVG file template, you can use that and some info about the concave i provide via gradient shaded background to draw your own outline. 

draw your deck, upload the file, submit your order, bob's your uncle. if i like the shape i'll name it after you and provide it as an option for other customers unless you don't want to share.

That's really cool. I see the changes that you made to the site. The deck page is definitely clearer and I think the summary page makes sense. 

The design your own deck concept is a really cool idea. How much customization is possible? Is it basically the shape or also the concave, micro drops, etc.?  What about using an established board as a template that could be scanned (though that may create some copyright issues)? I had checked out your site a while back when I shopping for my next board. I saw that you had stopped building on 3rd party decks and wasn't into the designs that I saw, so I moved on. 

I really like this style of board. Would your new approach allow me to use a pic like this to essentially trace the design and then upload to you? I think that would be pretty cool and would allow a ton of flexibility to your customers if they see a design that they like.

Those kinds of shapes would be just fine using my concave. At the moment i'm limited to customizing only the cutout shape and using the only concave i have a mold for, the Scarlet. But if this idea catches on, I can get more molds made and boxes for those concaves and you'll be choosing from a few concaves instead of cutouts and then uploading your own cutout shape. I figured i would use customer requests to gauge demand and determine what concaves to invest in since mold fees aren't cheap. The first addition one would likely be a more generic concave like you find in this deck or in a more traditional landyachtz, then i would get into microdrops and that kind of craziness. 

ITs going to take all year to get this polished as it is, i'm sure. So I'm starting simple and getting the bugs out of the internal processes while leaving room to expand the option sets with not only additional decks but also other ESCs, motor mounts, bearing options, wheel options, motor pulley options, remote options, etc. 

Then there's accessories. Something i could add right away is what size t-shirt are you because those are already included as a free gift with the board. Then tool kits and shredlights and all kinds of other stuff. 

BTW shredlights are included in the price of my builds now, so the default option is to get them unless you tell me you don't want them. Thanks to Eric over there who likes what i do and gave me a dealer discount for using his stuff.

That's a really cool concept and works with the direction you are taking the website. I bet you won't get a lot of requests for different concaves. If you have the original Scarlet one, that is probably enough to start. As far as the microdrops (please forgive my ignorance because I know practically nothing about molds for decks), couldn't you use a metal insert to place on the wood that will become the top of the deck before putting it into the press? microdrops are really just small indentations that allow you to sense with your foot where it should be on the deck for better stability. I'd think an oval piece of strong metal no more than 1/4" thick could be placed at the front and rear of the deck to make those pocket indentations. Maybe with rounded or tapered edges to prevent digging into the board.

Btw, sorry for the sidetrack. I realize you are looking for feedback on your website.

guys. 

I have just streamlined a process from illustrator to my xcarve. 

I can take a chicken scratch drawing on napkins and as long as it works with my concave, box, and trucks template, i can have it cutting in like ten minutes. https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/uploads/db1493/original/3X/f/5/f5f6d0197bdfddd1fc477c468be4c3cf6e3ad46d.png

Last night i finished the template up and then jake and I made a mashup of two decks: Scarlet classic tail with the gothic coffin looking nose of a generic blank i got off ebay a long time ago. 

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/f/5/f5f6d0197bdfddd1fc477c468be4c3cf6e3ad46d.png" width="125" height="500">

We just sat there in illustrator and were like "make it like this.. no wait.. make it like that.." 

That's sort of what i want to do with my customers. So they can have things like this:
