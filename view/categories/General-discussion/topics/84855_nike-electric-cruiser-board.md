_"A lot of people using the Personal Mobility. But when you not using Personal Mobility, it's very hard to carry around. I designed the Personal mobility device, which is easy to carry and charge at the same time." "Most boarders carry their boards by hand when not using them."_

Smart driving? Like my $30,000 car that randomly brakes hard when it gets confused with obstacles on the road that's gonna be a great safety feature for esk8.

You can disable brake assist in the menu but it has it's occasional hiccups when on that could be devastating on an esk8.

Yah that's the only appealing thing about it.

And I'm not sure it's even that useful. Who wants to carry a board full of batteries on their backpack all day? Plus the backpack would need more batteries to charge the board? Do we get a backpack to charge the backpack that charges the board? But what will charge that backpack?!

Perhaps these comments are a bit deep :joy:. It's just a render of a tesla-esque skateboard with probably undeveloped "tech" on it. It's just some pictures really.

What market would they produce this for? Skaters likely won't want that and non skaters can't skate. Strange one. They should just put a stick and handlebar on the front and open the market up 2000% for themselves.

I know style is a personal preference but to me that thing is hideous. I would also be thinking the spoiler thing on top is meant to go at the back which seems like it would just interfere with your rear foot and the whole thing looks fairly tall.
Backpack charging seems redundant, for the backpack to charge it needs batteries, if your going to carry around batteries in your backpack why not just a hot swap-able battery pack ? Couldn't imagine the fun in doing a long ride and having to carry your board for a while to let it charge vs just swapping out for the fresh battery and being on the go again.

Agreed, That is why I'm excited that the majority of VETS on the forum are innovators and risk takers. just in the past year I have learned so much and elevated the products we resale or make in house, diversification will drive the DIY industry.  I promote Quality products, serious customer service and support only rivaled by a few. I love the ability to source products from the small guy ( I'm a small guy) and find ways to help those that help other with free test products and discounts you can't get anywhere else. Everyone will criticize for whatever reason, it's tolerable. We see who does what and why and try to aline or team up with those serious about the industry. We sell enertion products and are the Central Texas RA for Raptors seeing the same drive for quality and service. From a business standpoint, a forum is a tool that benefits all in the right scenario.  From Us as vendors to the individual that gets guidance through a build thread or a discussion about a part he/she wants to use. Having both on a Forum has made the connection easier and help & support more available.

Many design flaws, but fresh out of the box thinking. The twin deck design could decouple the deck from vibrations.  Always good to see students make a project happening. Heads up!

In the spirt of constructive criticism, it doesn’t look very practical, would not ride the same as many other boards and is a bit high of the ground. Could be good to break the mold and it is realy cool to see such a large company that has an effect on culture to be interested in esk8

I'd like an explanation of the two-tier design, it looks like the top half of the board is supposed to tilt, yet the trucks look like they also tilt to steer...
Is it a functional part of the design to have the top of the deck connected by two little points or is it an aesthetics choice of jaehyuk Lim?
If it's just for looks, it's not to my taste, and I believe, depending on implementation, add considerable cost weight and failure points to the design.

In general, artistic mock-ups like this one I don't care for. they seem to have a common theme -- trendy product, a 'look' that functionally interferes with the purported operation, prominent copyright markings for something that has plan for actually being built... It looks like the intro design for a kickstarter that takes the money and runs, except for the nike part...

As for the post about constructive criticism... opinions are like elbows. I've seen very well done constructive criticism in very toxic environments and very helpful awesome forums that wouldn't know constructive criticism if they were sleeping with it's mother (Modern Vespa is a great example)

I'd suggest that product designs and mock-ups have their own tag or sub-forum called 'vapor-ware' or 'what-if'

it's just a prototype, a virtual one at that.  i bet it's someone's senior year design project or master's design thesis.

just like cars, prototypes have all kinds of cool, imaginative features.  then the thing comes out and everything's changed to be in the real world.

same this this board.  i bet cheapo hubs, standard trucks, no backpack charging -- just another shit board.

Exactly, you are asking bunch of builders what they think about this. we can see straight through the BS. 

@onloop don't get it twisted this is the most supportive community i have been part off. We were just giving like we see it.

I agree... i see members giving out free advice, tools and even parts to others.  I can think of a lot of examples but a personal one happened after eating shit. @topcloud hooked me up with a helmet no questions asked... just to save the rest of my ugly face.  I kinda like the look the more i see it but more for a scooter than a board

The good:

* Ideas around portability are nice (I use a "pool deck" because a 40" long board is way to f'ing long for me to lug up and down stairs to the train and I'm only like 5'4" tall so it's a pain in the ass to carry anywhere else too)

* The design aesthetic is very clean

* Separation between the board itself and the electronics means you could re-use the same "frame" (thinking cars) with a different deck on top (some designs appear to show this for driving a cooler around, an idea we've been tossing around at my office too)

The impractical:

* Wheels appear to be mostly hard plastic with thin rubber outside?  We typically use urethane in part for shock absorption but also imagine those thin pieces of rubber would wear out super fast.
* The tail appears to be made of plastic this is very likely to crack also when the tail is sliding to pop the board up into your hand or to stop/hard turn you're going to break or scrape the heck out of that nice clean plastic tail.
* I don't see any sort of charge port anywhere perhaps can be assumed it's hidden on the bottom but would be nice to show where that is and/or how this is meant to interface with a backpack
* Even with a relatively short deck most boards are bigger than your average back pack, how does that back pack look on a person? Is it like a hiking/camping back pack? is that better than carrying the board? (agreeing with others too about why carry the charger and batteries etc. why not just make the batteries swappable... I've been doing this myself for a while it's not the cleanest looking or easiest on the end user but it is more practical).
* Idea of some sort of sensor that could let you know or somehow control the board in a way that doesn't kill you is idealistic.  Moving at high speed and accurately detecting small things like rocks that are tiny but maybe big enough to cause you problems isn't really feasible.

I'm happy to see someone working for Nike giving any time to even think about this but agree these are very early looking designs and would need some serious overhauls once met with reality.  This isn't anything against the designer, my own board had to be rebuilt a few times and I started off just following the beaten path, but if we are going to put out a concept then it should be open to scrutiny and some criticism where justified.

I can get behind this. I'm beta testing Nike SBs now on jake. I'm still wearing AF1s most of the time and VANs when i need to feel everything. Jake says the SBs are a lot like VANS in the feels but are more comfortable. And i noticed they don't seem to fall apart. Vans fall apart quickly. Thye may in fact be the perfect skate shoe if that's the case. 

Mine would have a red swoosh and sole, deep grey fabric, and the winged logo on the tounge. 

they'll never do that, though. lol

Nike sb's are the longest lasting shoe for a pro scooter rider who kills vans in 3 weeks.  I get 3 months out of the sb's.  Kids a shoe killer.  
As for the board well that backpack idea is a winner for sure.  Wouldn't it be nice to have some big business invest some time and money just like the guys at Mattel have with the solar raptor.  Personally I love the concept but damn this place can be brutal at times.

Geez peeps just freaking relax. It's just a concept. Someone has put a lot and effort into creating something cool based on a brief. Probably a uni project. Unless you have personally ridden it how can you really judge it's ride quality anyway? Yes we can have a good guess based on the images but it's a concept piece. See concept cars.
It's not Nike (I don't think)
The dude might not be a native English speaker.
If it goes into production and you see people buy them is it going to upset you?
Anyway
I assume that the double deck is for storage of the bag.
It looks slick. Something for the masses of people who have money burning a hole in their pockets.
