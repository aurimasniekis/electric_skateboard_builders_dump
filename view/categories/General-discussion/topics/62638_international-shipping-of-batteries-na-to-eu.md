Hi everyone,
I have a question regarding a topic that has been mentioned a few times but I have not found an answer to it.
That is the international shipping of batteries.
I am currently living in Canada and build myself a board here. But soon I am moving back to Germany and am currently trying to figure out how I can bring my board with me.
The Battery I am using is from the DIYeboard 10S3P kit and is rated at ~230Wh.
The common allowance for lithium metal batteries is 100 Wh/160 Wh so I wont we able to bring it on with me on the plane.
I am planing to take the board with me and sending the battery via ground shipping.

Or do you think I should just by a new battery? I know the DIYeboard cells are not the greatest and I might look into slowly improving my board with other, better parts. But I can't find a 10S3P battery in europe for a price that does not shock me :smiley: 

Does anyone have experience with shipping a battery that way?
What would it cost to send it via ground mail and how long does it take?

Actual question is if you're going to be able to sell your old one for a half decent price.

You can't use ground shipping since there is not much soil between Canada and Europe. And shipping it on a ship would take ages and will be quite expensive since you just need to send a single battery.

You're only option is lying about the capacity and taking it on the plane or shipping it with express post. I belive UPS don't have problems with taking batteries.

But, DIYeboard batteries are not the greatest,  you could have a 10s3p with 340wh made and I can definitely recommend @koralle He really knows what he's doing : )

I'm aware of the lack of soil between Canada and Europe :smiley:
Just considered shipping via ship as "ground shipping" in contrast to air.
Back in Germany I frequently ordered parts from china and I'm pretty sure they came via ship. So I thought that would be a viable option.

I am not sure how I feel about lying about it. I definitely don't want to take it on the plane with me. It's not worth the hassle. UPS might be an option.

And like I mentioned. I know the battery I currently have is not great. But beeing able to use it for a bit longer until the winter or so is better than having buy a better, more expensive one.

That might be a last resort.
I am not sure how the airport security will react to a split unlabeled battery pack :joy:

So it seems no one has shipped batteries "intercontinentally" :confused:

The thing is, I would risk "losing" the battery, since I would have to leave it here anyways.
I don't know/want to risk the consequences that shipping it via air or putting in in my suitcase would bring.

I just found "International Surface Parcel" by Canada Post for about 20 CAD.

https://www.canadapost.ca/cpc/en/personal/sending/parcels/compare-services-international/international-parcel.page

That could be an option. 20 CAD for a Battery after 1-2 Month is better than no Battery. :smiley:
