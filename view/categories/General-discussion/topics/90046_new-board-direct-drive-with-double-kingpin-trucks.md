@Topcloud I assume you've known about this board for awhile? :rofl:

:grimacing: 

Fortunately for you, the elofty drives are pretty durable but the rest of it.. good luck :+1:



e: youre wasting your money at miles board, look at their other offerings. 3AH battery, SINGLE hub motor, shitty china deck, trucks, wheels and ESC for 499.... You can do better on your own, or at least get a meepo for that price.

you dont want this board, its going to be a big disappointment. Stick with a meepo with the sanyo battery if youre looking for a cheaper chinese budget board :+1: 

If youre bent on buying the direct drive set, @topcloud is doing a group buy

Personally, if I were in the market for a new Chinesk8 complete, I‚Äôd wait two more months.  

Most of the next-generation boards are your choice, belt or hub, in a real carbon fiber enclosure or deck for ~$1299 to $1499.  

@Tetsu visited Ownboard this week, check out his post (or their IG) for pics of what I think we can expect to see everywhere this fall.  This should be a good year for esk8. 

In regards to the drives and group buy, we‚Äôre rebuilding the test platform this week - once we have working brakes on Unity, we will ask Lofty for tiered pricing at 25 and 50 units (we presently have 100 minimum qty. pricing). 

They could say no, and that‚Äôs perfectly understandable as they have bigger customers, yet they seem willing to work with us.  I‚Äôd have to say overall Lofty Shenzhen seems like a good company. 

Hope this helps!

Does that mean the group buy is delayed? :D 

my bank account has put up the fort again, after Ive funneled my money into these last two builds and needs time to catch its breath :joy: 

fingers crossed for summer

E; woops

Thanks for your efforts. I don‚Äôt have enough skills and don‚Äôt have big tools like lathe. So I can‚Äôt help them about developing their stuffs but you guys can. If you want to cooperate them, PM me.  I can show the emails of CEO ( or manager?, I‚Äôm not sure)  @EOVAN. (Of course they also have open channels like wechat etc) And I recommend you to use video chat, because he‚Äôs not good at English. 

But this will have possibility that make problems like ‚Äúpatent war‚Äù (between Enertion and Torqueboard) etc. This kind of problem has both pros and cons, sometimes prevents innovation, and sometimes revitalize the market. I hope latter situation of course but.

I feel most Chinese companies‚Äô sence of patent and intellectual property rights etc are now changing but still very different from other countries. ( I have to say Japan had same time for a while after WW2) .
