The evolution of electric transportation is moving at a rapid pace. Now a team in Germany has taken on the task of designing an electric helicopter. It is the e-volo green helicopter touted as the first electric passenger helicopter. The team’s vision is to make the world’s safest sports aircraft.

Very cool. It appears they are spinning half one way and half the other (or something like that), negating the need for a tail rotor.

Drones do that too. My son and I found that out accidentally by returning the blades to the wrong motors on his micro drone. We wondered for a time why it would just spin in circles and act erratically. After some pizza and some Transformers movies we figured it out.
