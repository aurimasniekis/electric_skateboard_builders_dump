Hello there! 
I an doing this post to share tips, knowledge, useful informations to help whomever like me is scared to death to see their house burnt down to the groud.
I’m doing myself a 12s6p li ion out of NESE modules to avoid bad soldering as I’m surely not a professional, and I’ll be able to check my battery each few weeks easily.
What do you guys do to prevent a fire in your home while storaging the board or charging? 
Personally I’ll keep it in the basement, and I’m thinking to build a big box out of plasterboard or drywall as its FireProof... will fire blankets be enough for a Li ion fire?

I don't leave it charging unless I'm in the same room awake. Other than that, not much.

Ok now a really dumb question but I don’t really know as lots of lads on the forum were scared to a fire of a battery not connected, and not in function, let’s say you leave your board turned off, is it really possible? If I have my battery in the board while not riding could it really take fire?

I think it's happened but not sure if to anyone on the forum, when it does it's really rare and means there was likely a fault in the battery pack. You should always be ready to get it somewhere safe if it starts making weird sounds but you really shouldn't need to worry.

Untouched and properly cared  are Li-Ion batteries not unsafer than any kind of electronics.
 
1. Don't leave the board with charger alone, check for unexpected hot components after charging and riding once in a while. 
2. Motors, ESC, BMS and batteries can be hot but especially the later two (three) shouldn't be to hot to touch. The ESC can be checked by software (bluetooth app), a regularly hot BMS should get improved cooling (and or battery status checked) and a battery shouldn't be more than "just warm" basicly.
3. Hot connectors or wiring are often indicators for bad build design/quality and loose connections (which should be avoided).

You shouldn't fully charge up and never fully discharge the battery (40-50% charged or ~3,75 V/per cell  are ideal for storage) when you plan to leave the board for a while in the closet (storage). You should also make sure that you don't have silent drain on the battery while powered off (easiest is a loop-key).

Thanks! Lots of useful informations, one question about the silent drain, I’ll use a Bestech BMS 80A, should I use a loop key anyway?

The E-switch from the bms should be fine, but nothing wrong to check the battery voltage before and after when you happen to leave the board for 1 or 2 weeks once.
