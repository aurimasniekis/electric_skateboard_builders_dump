I recently swapped to my raptor 1 to 97 mm abec 11 wheels.  I was curious if they make a solid replacement drive pulley to overcome the taller wheels for more down low torque.

Also is there a setting that adjust the gain of the transmitter to make the controller scale more realistically.  I added some dead band and that helps but hoping to find a more linear acceleration of the nano x controller.  The thing is awesome but I just find a quarter throttle is about all the throttle range covers.  End points are set appropriately but seems like the range of the throttle is off.  I come from the world of drones so the setting are familiar but BLDC is somewhat new to me.
