Hi guys! I am working on Paris style truck both original and clone one. I would need to make new M8 threaded and online I found that the mitch should be 5/16 - 24 that in metric is M8 X 1.25mm. Then when I tried is not correct, it looks more x1mm pitch. Does someone perhaps know which thread to use for these truck? Thanks a lot!

Damn I will try again. I thought so but I tried with other M8 nuts that have the same 5/16 24pitch and they don't work. While with the one the truck come with works on multiple trucks. Thanks for checking! Appreciate
