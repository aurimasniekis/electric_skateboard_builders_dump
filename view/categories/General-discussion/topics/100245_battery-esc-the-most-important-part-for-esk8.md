This article was written to quickly learn about skateboard batteries and ESC for skateboarders who don't plan to build their own skateboards and compare the battery and ESC of commercial boards.

**Battery**

Batteries have an impact on performance such as torque, speed as well as durability, life-cycle and safety. The quality of a battery pack also affects the significant of voltage sag.

However, it is an overwhelming experience for beginners trying to understand the battery of an electric skateboard. When a beginners gets a battery parameter, they see the terminology of "amperes", "ampere hours", "voltage watts", "10s2p", "18650 units" and "continuous discharge"that simply makes no sense to someone without a working knowledge of batteries.

So, I will directly compare the skateboards which using Samsung and Sanyo batteries which are the most common batteries on the market to explain the parameters of the battery. First, I will show you a table as following:

||Evolve GTR|Ownboard Carbon AT|Yecoo GT|
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|Battery Brand|Samsung|SANYO|Samsung|
|Capacity|14Ah|14Ah|15Ah|
|Range|19 miles|19 miles|21 miles|
|Discharge Rate|30A|20A|30A|
|Voltage|36V|36V|36V|
|Connection|-|10S4P|10S5P|

*Note: all of the skateboards in the table are all terrain skateboards*

According to the above table, battery capacity will affect the cruising range of the skateboard. The larger the battery capacity leads to the wider the cruising range. However, for the battery brand, it is worth mentioning that compared to expensive SANYO battery , Samsung is the better choice when they have same capacity. Battery capacity is definitely one of the most used specification when a company markets their board.It is also a more reliable reflection of the range than the marketed range, and it also shows you if a company is inflating their board’s range.

For voltage, industry standard is 36V. If the voltage is too low, the board will not have enough torque. If the voltage is too high, the motor/ ESC can not handle it. So almost of all skateboards on the market have the same voltage that I needn’t talk about it with more words. The actual issue I’ll discuss is voltage sag mentioned above, which means the speed will be slower when the battery power is low. If it is reduced, the Board will keep going on high speeds even when the battery power is low. The voltage sag is related to the discharge rate. The high discharge rate made the voltage sag reduce.

Series and Parallel are the configuration for how the battery cells are connected. How the cells connect impacts the Voltage and Amperes Hours. On the market, The battery cells is usually connected as 10s2p, 10s3p, 10s4p and 10s5p. It’s the business of the technician.

 

For the same brand of battery, there will be different models, as far as I am concerned, I think the Samsung 18650 30Q is currently the most cost-effective battery on the market, which can be satisfied by most skateboarders. But Some skateboarders who pursue high-end configuration will use the Samsung 21700 50E, which has high performance, but the cost-effective is worse than 30Q so that 50E can not suitable for common  skateboarders.

**ESC**

ESC(electric speed control) is another core part of electric skateboards. It mainly controls the speed change of the electric skateboard. An excellent ESC electric skateboard will be very smooth when accelerating, and when the bad ESC is accelerating, the speed of the skateboard will suddenly increase, which is very easy to cause wrestling. I only recommend Hobbywing ESC. Hobbywing is specialized in aircraft control panels, and the research on controllers is very good, so its ESC is temporarily irreplaceable in the electric skateboard industry. Most of the best skateboards on the market, such as Ownboard, use Hobbywing ESC.

**Conclusion**

Battery and ESC are the two important parts for a electric skateboard. Battery is the main power source and ESC is work for controlling the speed. Only when these two parts are selected correctly, will there be a comfortable skateboarding experience。The above content is personal opinion, for reference only, if there is any error, please correct me.
