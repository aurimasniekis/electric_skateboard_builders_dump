Use this thread to discuss ideal (or dream) builds that you'd like to create one day.
This could serve as a hub for those looking for inspiration with a build, or just a way to doccument your crazy ideas! 
So come one, come all, and share what you wanna try and throw together (eventually)!

Think someones doing that exact build.  Sure I've seen it somewhere.  
I'm kind of riding my dream build right now so not sure what else to dream about.
I would like a light weight mountain board that could still flex but have the electronics integrated so no top mount without worrying about damaging on jumps.
Someone make a light weight, flexible, integrated mb deck that still has flex.  Well you did say dream didn't you? :joy:

Right now I'm converting my Carver into a 4WD with a second Kaly.NYC gear drive for the front. 

Mostly just as a masturbatory engineering exercise, and for board options at Barrett Junction. I have the feeling it'll be too heavy to be viable in the long run.

I really don't care what Boosted does, but it would be cool to see them put something out on the market that is more geared towards experienced riders. I still wouldn't buy it, but its better than the underwheling boards they have on the market right now :man_shrugging:

I know people will disagree with this, this is just my opinion

I have checked out both of their sites (@psychotiller and @longhairedboy   , both are great. I'm currently on my sixth build, a boosted clone :joy: 

Not many people know about the esk8 community, but most in the bay area are aware of Boosted Boards. When I talk to them and from what I have heard, it seems that Boosted represents the esk8 community, and that makes me sad that a 7 mile range 20 mph topspeed board is the "best money can buy". If you go on youtube, many thumbnails are often "Better than a Boosted Board", or something along those lines. I just feel that if Boosted came out with a much upgraded board, people would be much more encouraged to start riding esk8s, and also see the esk8 communtiy in a different light. 

In a counter point to what I just said though, upgraded consumer boards could possibly make people more aware of the laws against electric bikes and skateboards, and that would be bad lol

Much like evolve then.  Its just about dollars with those guys and if its not broke then don't fix it.  The only way they will ever upgrade or make a more capable board is if people stop buying them and thats highly unlikely

I want a board that has torque enough to rip the soles off my shoes, top speed 100mph, 1 million miles range, 40 inch deck, evolve supercarves, 7 inch tires durable enough that it can survive being thrown off a 20 story building, weight under 15 lbs. and must have rave lights and build in sound systems

I see the difference. I upgraded the hell out of my Evolve GT, but I’m not sure my new board is a viable “consumer” product. It will throw you off the back at 20 MPH if you are not careful with the throttle. Maybe Evolve and Boosted are useful for the entry level. 

Jury’s out though, either one of those companies could come out with a hot board. Boosted just raised 60 million dollars. My big complaint with Evolve was lack of standardization for upgrades. So I burned it down.

That is a good point.  I can't imagine anyone jumping on any of my boards without any experience.  Boosted are actually cool for entry level be honest.  I've been ragging on them for years and rode one for the first time 2 days ago.  (please don't judge me too harshly)  It was fun.  Yes I said it fun.  Going for a lie down.

I hate to be that guy, but I don't think we'll see wireless power to vehicles until it's built into the infrastructure. There's nowhere near enough energy potential carried in that type of radio. And given how many god damned potholes there are where I live, I'm guessing my great grand children might benefit from that technology at this point.

Now with that said, I think advances of energy storage technologies are going to make a lot of the concept of wireless power not worth the infrastructure investment. The sun is a much more powerful & plentiful source of radiation than anything we're emitting into the environment. And even still, something like solar on vehicles doesn't work as you'd never have enough space  collect enough to justify the cost/weight- it always will make more sense to charge based on a renewable source


A good example I use at the day job is that when it rains, you've got options on getting water to drink. You could potentially run through the rain with your mouth open (radio/solar charging of vehicles), or you could setup rain collectors that store the water for usage over time, in whatever storage container you choose (stationary solar panel array feeding into a battery/charger). 

I live in the PNW and pay about $0.06/kWh for local renewable energy. I'm already at the point where I can ride hundreds of miles a month and pay pennies for my commute.

.... I might be a little stoned.

Didn't mean it that way. I meant that the board only needs some micro amperes to get powered and that this power could be delivered via radio rays or summer heat
Wait a sec...
If the board only needs 0.00x mA we can just use some batteries and drive till we die

Dreams don't have to be realistic, right?

The dream would be as lightweight as possible, sealed drivetrain, a shitload of torque, and durable.  I'm wanting something that you can do grinds and ollies and jumps go practically anywhere.

I've already got a Kaly/Trampa build and I love it, but it's not lightweight enough for what I dream of.

Oh yeah.  Thing is we build skateboards and the guys selling them have trouble going over $2000 for a retail cost.  These guys with a similar electrical set up can sell for 15000.   Water craft see?  Jetskis are expensive and the market is already up there.  Better business tbh.

In the achievable one, I'm a simple man. I want my fucking e-skates to be finished already! 

Damn bitch ass CNC / forged parts and arduino shit are giving both me and wallet a heartache (headache is overrated).

Edit : Here are the unobtainium 1 & 2.

Possible now with Google glass. 

There are other products picking up where Google left off. You would need to develope an app for it or it may just work cause then Google powered watches just work.

Edit: just checked and Google has brought back the the glass and has been developing it more. So you could have all the Vesc data on HUD and even have GPS and other nice functions like a camera etc.

Not sure ill go with my original post.
TB DD would be rad. 
But im still craving some 6365 maytechs. 200kv if 10s, 170-180kv if 12s.
Not sure if I'll use my tkp surfrodz or pick up a new set of rkp.
Definitely want focboxes. 
Probably 97mm wheels.  (Save the moe wheel dream for a faster build)
The list of thing to buy never ends.
@torqueboards wanna donate some DD? Lol

Thought I'd share what I'm dreaming for my next build:

Landyachtz 40" Switchblade deck
Bergmeister wheels
Surfrodz RKP trucks
Dual helical gear drive
12s 4 or 5p, using the Vruzend DIY battery kit
And instead of going with a regular enclosure, I want to put everything in a hard-case on top of the middle of the board like mountain boards often do. This would allow me to safely mount my trucks in drop-through fashion, and have the cool bottom graphic of the board visible!

So, what's keeping me away from building this right now?
1) Money :smile:
2) WE NEED A GEAR DRIVE FOR SURFRODZ RKP TRUCKS!!! I'm sick of pebbles in my belts, and don't want to buy 2 direct-drives just for extra torque.
3) An adapter for the hypothetical gear drive and the Bergmeister wheels.
4) I don't know if I'd get wheel-bite or not with this, because all I've seen are Evolve trucks being used to combine the switchblade with pneumatic wheels...

Have you given your parents the full disclosure?

Do they know what a beast that is?

If yes. I don’t know if your parents are cool or irresponsible.

the first one i don't have the balls to do and the second one isn't too bad. its just my dream one, i wouldn't do it this young. My parents understand the danger of eboarding and I wear a helmet, wristguard, and kneepads. don't worry, my parents are very responsible. but thanks for the concern :grin:

I want a board that cruises forever at 5 to 10 mph with a crazy reactive lighting system, and perhaps even an on board LED projector so that I can project sharks swimming along with me. I also want to load my race board to the gills with sensors and employ data logging and  machine learning to improve efficiency, safety, heat managent visual and tactile feedback and more. Oh, and one with wire wheels and airbags that will do the hooptie.

Well I'm on my way to my first dream build. 
30-35km 
40km/h
I'm thinking on a color scheme or topic for it, it doesn't have a name jet, and may be with the colors of a WW2 combat plane
