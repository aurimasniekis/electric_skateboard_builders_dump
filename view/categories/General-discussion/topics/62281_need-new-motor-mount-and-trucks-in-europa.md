The issue about these mounts is that they are not mirrored left and right. So esthetically it will not be symmetrical but still working. Let us know with pics how are they mounted

@Marvedjensen any updates? I am in a similar position as well, so it would be great to hear from your experience. Someone used a spacer in a mount pretty similar to yours.
