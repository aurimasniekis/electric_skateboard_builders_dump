I'm starting a petition in Florida to explicitly allow electric skateboards anywhere a bicycle is allowed. 

The argument is that electric skateboards provide a smaller footprint and the same or similar speed capabilities as a bicycle while paving the way for more personal electric vehicle alternatives for commuting and short distance travel in an age where fossil fuels are waning and people are looking for more environmentally responsible and enjoyable forms for transportation. 

The petition is here:
http://www.thepetitionsite.com/303/796/798/give-electric-skateboards-the-same-rights-as-bicycles/

and i also have a shortlink that redirects to that as well:
[esk8.me/petition](http://esk8.me/petition)

I would encourage you to start one in your state if you don't already have laws on the books regarding these things. My objective is to get ahead of it so that we have good laws instead of knee-jerk reaction laws to some kid doing something stupid and getting himself killed involving an esk8.

It looks really good.  I would change "paved trails are accessible." to paved access or paves pathways, trails sounds like Park and you may not want to allude to that.  I have co-workers in Naples and Miami, I could get them to sign it when you are ready.

I think i've re-read it enough. @mmaner had a good point so i revised based on his thoughts but i think that was the only potential issue.

Be clear, articulate, and direct. And brief. It was hard for me not to ramble on but instead to stay to the point while trying to relate it to a common concern that people can get behind even if they don't have any interest in skateboards or esk8s.

Even if I signed the petition, would it not be better if the majority of people who signed this were from Florida? This is trying to win over the hearts and mind of the Floridians.

Aren't ebikes limited to 250W where you live? And only legal with pedal assistance no direct throttle?
At least thats the case in most EU.

ebikes are allowed anywhere bicycles are, thier restriction while on paper are essentially unenforcable. The important bit of that is that they are explicitly mentioned and allowed. Esk8s are not. Esk8s are not recognized or categorized or even have any level of awareness surrounding them. 

Its time to shit or get off the pot. Either then need to be legal or not.

unfortunately for that approach i build muscle boards. Loud, obnoxiously fast muscle boards with huge motors and giant batteries. And typically they're aggressively styled and have ridiculous colors and artwork on them.

Have you read the laws? In a free state anything that is not explicitly banned is legal. In my state a skateboarder is classified as a pedestrian and not allowed in the bike lanes.

i've had several people, including actual lawyers, interpret them for me. They all feel that the way it is written, they're by default banned instead of by default not an issue. But because they're so new, it hasn't mattered yet.

so i was looking over my facebook post on this, the one that i boosted. Started getting some comments. 

Some of the cyclists hate the idea, which is ok. I get it. 

Some poeple are getting hostile though. lol

This one dude John Rice (that's his facebook name anyway) didn't realize who i was, he works at jimmi johns where i used to go to lunch every day. He was ranting like a 12 year old boy who just got pwnd by his little sister in some FPS gaming clan competition. called me lazy and a loser and all kinds of fun stuff. 

hahahaha. We'll see what happens next.

I would say good job ... but that guy just lost his job! Nevertheless, he did deserve it - he could have said what he thought with less emotion and then left it when he saw he was going nowhere with his 'point' ... but he didn't and ranted from behind his keyboard ... and got fired.

he messaged me on facebook privately to continue spewing the vitriol. I'm not 100% on his firing either, but he definitely got a talking to of some kind. 

I told him to feel free to assault me out in the open like a man so we can finish this. 

I think people forget that there's a human being behind the screen, and that those people are real and exist in the same world, and often the same place that they do. Don't say anything to anyone online you wouldn't say to their face. For all you know, you see them everyday and they know who you are. And they're fucking nuts like me.

s. 316.2065(11) 

 No person upon roller skates, or riding in or by means of any coaster, toy vehicle, or similar device, may go upon any roadway except while crossing a street on a crosswalk; and, when so crossing, such person shall be granted all rights and shall be subject to all of the duties applicable to pedestrians.

Even regular skateboards are illegal on property controlled by the government, unless explicitly permitted, not sure if that means sidewalks.

Frankly I think drawing attention to the issue would make an outcry for enforcement of a law that is generally ignored if you're not destroying property or blocking cars.

[/quote]

So you're suggesting that "shit or get off the pot" may be a detrimental approach to this situation?

I've often considered this. I've often wondered if we should just wait, let them become common, and then let the people gradually just change the law the way we always do. I haven't been actively promoting this recently because the temperature i took was kind of high when the more close minded cyclists in the orlando area got wind of this. 

maybe we take over first and then make the accommodations...

I'd love to, but he has a room full of qualified people to edit his daily life. 

Yeah, it's a tough call, but until we start getting ticketed, I think it's better to let the cops feel like enforcing anti skating laws is for situations where people are doing tricks on public structures that cost lots of money to repair. The approach of a 'right' to skate, to many, sounds like a right to vandalize public property.
