As some of you know, I've invested in a laser cutter for the primary purpose of designing and cutting griptape.  I hit a snag on the vendor I was using, they just informed me it will not ship until mid-march at the earliest because of laser tube issues they are having with the model I opted for.

In the meantime, I am doing some hand cuts and gathering artwork for when the eventual laser cutter actually gets here.  I am getting some practice and learning the fundamentals of cutting with a laser from a local resource, an HVAC company believe it or not.  So I should be ready, when I have the hardware in place, 

I have not even started thinking about prices yet, at least not seriously.  Pu sImply, this is just something I've always liked & enjoyed doing and its damned near impossible to get elaborate cuts by hand.  If you have ideas, something you think would make a cool griptape design, specific artwork you would like cut, etc. let me know.

I really love geometrical patterns, and I believe others do too.

The Darth Maul is a very good example of that

I have actually been hand cutting hexagons for awhile now.  I really like them too :).  When I get the laser cutter up and running I'm going to package them in different colors and sell it as a kit with a guide and everything.

This is a board I've been working on for awhile now, if I could just get some free time to and decent weather I'd finish it and show it off here.

If I had that laser cutter, I'd definitely cut something Escher inspired!

I would be interested in antihexagons.  Imagine the hexagon pattern except make them really small and make the spaces between them really big.  Now imagine the inverse of that...  So basically hexagon-shaped holes all over.  While you're at it, I want the hexagons that were cut out as well.... for a different deck ....  :slight_smile:  and just like that, no waste

@mmaner how dou you cut the grip? the one i'm using is very rough and the glue is a nightmare, sticks to everything, cutting just the outline after gluing was exhausting and there's lot of the residue on the side of the deck that i still have to remove, i can't imagine cutting the amazing patterns you did, but hey, maybe my grip is crap

I usually draw/print whatever I want in reverse, trace or paint or whatever on the back of the grip tape and cut it from the back, when I am hand cutting anyways.

You have to convert the image into paths, set the dimensions for the outside then send it to the cutter,  YOu have to pay attention to power, speed and passes mostly.

I recommend you go to the dollar store and pick up a new pair of scissors and a 100 pack of razor blades before cutting.

I threw the scissors and about 10 razor blades away when I was done with mine

Hey there Mike.

This might sound random. But some boards(loaded) have logos on top some people like to preserve. Possibly adding an option for a 4.25" circle cut out from the center like original grips on these boards. 

Obviously not limited to loaded, but... Would be nice to think about topside logo incorporation with the designs. Just figured I'd mention my thoughts. Looking forward to seeing some designs.

This is where you can have fun with vectors. And multiple shades of griptape. To come together to make a graphic. Ie dark medium coarse black base, with a very coarse black for the dark yellow section of nimbus and a light coarse black for the light yellow section of nimbus.

I like the idea of multiple colors if grip for gradients and shading. That will definitely be an option when the laser cutter is in place. 

For hand cuts I don't think it would come out great, at least it would be a PIA to get perfect. Vinyl is easy, you just cut it to shape on the side that shows, square off the inside and overlay the grip.  It would probably be a good idea to spray some clear coat iver the vinyl and let it cure for a day before applying the grip.

I think custom grip tape is the only thing I haven't seen for sale on the forum by a "maker". We have mounts, wheels (well... group buys anyway), decks, enclosures, batteries, motors, VESCs, risers (3d printed models). Thanks @mmaner for filling that hole :slight_smile:

Great idea to provide a service like this. I really liked the idea of geometric pattern tape but didn't want to go with Hexagon because it seems like everyones doing it, so I went with something different.

Green griptape inlaid with silver or gold griptape that looks like PCB traces.  Complete with fiducials, vias and header ports.

Hell, maybe even use a VESC 4.12 layer as inspiration.

The honeycomb table has clamps, as there is no lateral force the grip sits perfect.  Obviously you don't want to use it fresh off the roll.  I cut 42in pieces and weight them overnight..  That WAS the issue when I tried using a draw knife attachment with a CNC machine, you need a vacuum table to do that.

Be sure to properly ventilate that laser cutter. I went to a USDA meeting this weekend and we reviewed a case where the laser cutter emissions killed a family and their pets. Likewise many people don’t know that 3D printers emit nano particles which penetrate the lungs and cause severe breathing problems with elevated exposure. Not trying to scare anyone, just be cautious.

Grip tape art is great considering the batteries cover everything else xD 

Anyway, I love the art style on one of my snowboards, somthing like this would look pretty sick imo.

Just put a link to a short video of it... only got 3 items in when painting the gripe tape before someone bought it so I never fully finished my vision but then I started on a one of a kind custom holographic carbon fiber style paint job on one of my decks that i really like how it came out! It goes from black to the carbon fiber print coming out as well as a silver skull EMERGING from the darkness!!!! Lol. What I love about the layered holographic painting technique i used is it always looks different in different lighting!!!!! I do not want to hijak the post n I will post how i did it later but Here is a link showing it for anyone that is interested that is reading now...

The painy is layered in layers so that there is 2 coats of clear and then a coat of clear with black dusted in it and then when dries another coat of clear over it and that is what adds the holographic effect where it looks black until the light penetrates through the layer with black in it making it so the pattern and skull only show when light hits it! Pretty cool effect and here is a link showing how i did the carbon deck

That's been the trick, finding the right wattage and speed to make clean cut but not burn the edges.  I cut 2.25in hexagons out of 20 feet of Jessup Pimp Grip in black on Friday, and it was perfect. But it was on a 2 million dollar cutter at a friend if munes shop.

Yup that's the trick, cutting without anything distorting or charring/burning. If the machine has it, try running with the compressed air on the cut. Helps with flare-ups

Man a $2mill cutter that's awesome! I'd love to worth with something like that he's very lucky :)

The Mrs is still out and about but when she gets back I still want to run to the office and test the scraps I got today. My daughter wants a Bendy on her board haha

If the air isn't blowing directly on it you can adjust it at an angle so they fly to one side, then set the artwork to run those cuts first.

Otherwise on super light material you can only shoot 10 psi or so

1st Test = Ran at 50% speed on a 60w . Size 1" and took 3 seconds.

Could probably lower the power, it cut through this like butter. I cut through the back rather than the grip but I'm sure you did the same.

I'm thinking if I do a full sheet I'd probably push pin it to a board, small shapes it wouldn't be necessary to cut nice and even/flat . 50% isn't slow enough to go through 1/4"+. I can run a few passes at a higher speed but with speed compensation on the turns you probably won't save much actual overall time. At higher speeds there also may be some accuracy loss, nothing huge and not always really noticeable but I'd prefer it to be perfect

I'm using an Epilog Fusion 60w. The bed is only 32" wide though so if I were to do something that fully reached end to end on something larger you do two passes, once in the machine with bypassed font door sensor, turn around and do second half.

Honestly this cut through so easily you could do it with a 45w mini no problem

Here is 75% speed 100% power. Size 4" time = 22 seconds. I used color mapping to cut it inside out, as that auto feature was removed in later versions

If your cuts start getting wobbly at too high speeds, you can always slow her down and drop the power. But this still looks crisp at 75%. If you got yourself a 45w you'd just drop that speed to 56% to get near the same result and test cut a few pieces going up or down in speed and leaving the power the same. 

For this example going off my last setting you'd do (45/60)75speed= 56.25speed

Its by no means an exact formula to achieving the same result on a wholly different machine (not to mention all tubes are not created equal, power will wane as it nears the end of its lifetime, if all lenses/mirrors are undamaged/clean, etc), but it is a easy way to get a testing starting point when sharing settings :)

No problem man give me a holler if you get stuck or have any questions :smiley: . With setting tests its always easiest to just take a piece of scrap, choose a starting point for your settings, and test like crazy. The more stuff you do the easier it is to guess closer the first test.

I'm going to try and design something big in a two piece design now for the build I'm working on. Glad I stumbled onto this thread! Can't wait to see what you come up with

This is the most recent board I started painting... so far i sprayed it with black APPLIANCE EPOXY because it is amazing at making the grip tape look better ... hold up better... n clean off way easier!!! PLUS I cut a AUTOBOT stencil and started painting it and will be hand painting circuits and electronics on the grip tape also in a U.V REFLECTIVE orange paint that glows under u.v light and looks like it is all lit up!!! Will post on here and my channel... buffalo eskate!!!

Any ideas on transferring the tape to your board for easier application?

My current plan is to cut my tape pinned grip down to a plywood board, remove the pins, add second board to top to hold together, flip, apply transfer tape and remove from board. But at that point I still have to remove all the sticker backing without it coming apart.

I made these last night, the one with the painting I chose so if you want the Afro artwork file I'll shoot it over to you lol The one I chose I sized to a 26" x 10" cutout, and I'll just use scraps to cover the ends. That way everything fits nicely in my 32" bed

You can use a vacuum table if you can find one to hold the grip in place while you remove the backing.  The other option is to mask the front with a medium tack adhesive tape, flip it, remove the backing by pulling it away from the grip parallel wit the grip, meaning you keep the angle very low.  You still have to be careful as the grip will pull away from the mask tape.

That's another thing I was worried about. I have transfer tape for cutting/applying vinyl but I haven't tried to stick it to the grit yet.

Our lasers have downdraft tables but I think there is too much air leakage in the machine to really get good suction. Running 2 5hp blowers on the roof of my office, I can seal up 4 of the machines and just use one with non-covered holes taped, but I still am not sure it will be enough to peel on

EDIT: Whelp I wasn't thinking apparently. If the transfer tape I used for moving vinyl is too weak I can just use actual adhesive vinyl lol. Guess I finally found a way to get through that last roll of hot pink!
