so i¬¥m PISSED at this cyclist right now!

I was doing...oh...about 9-10kmh on a straight bike path when this asshole decided to cross a busy street and ride his bike perpendicular into the bicycle path and nearly collided into me from the left.  I was not expecting this since the street he crossed is very busy and no sane person would do such a thing. I mean his front wheel was about 20cm away from me when he decided to hit the brakes. FUCKING IDIOT!

geeeze....

true...**but** only if youre the only person around. 

as soon as i do stupid things i also put the health and saftey of others around me at risk...no? 

in my case the cyclist decided to cross a very busy street risking not only his health but also that of others. he got lucky he didnt get run over by a car...and i got lucky he didnt bump me and cause me get thrown off my board.
this was wreckless behavior.

my point is: wreckless behavior is dangerous to everybody...theres only so much you can contribute to your own safety. unfortunately the rest of it is out of your hands.

not true, because you decided to ride in an area where other people are, you‚Äôre not forced to ride a dangerous 2kW? skateboard in such an area. i‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs illegal too if your board does over 6km/h. Also that stupid üö¥‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è als could have been just a kid.

dude, read again and try to understand why i wrote this. its actually my answer to Deckoz post that says "The only person responsible for your safety is yourself"

my answer is written above. read again and this time try not to take my words out of context.

i was going a very relaxed 9-10km. i know that because i have installed a speedometer on my board. i was not speeding on a crowded bike path either, on the contrary it was empty. that cyclist came from a direction where you normally never expect a cyclist because its not an intersection where this happened.

it wasnt a kid because he had a beard. kids are smarter (given proper parenting) not to ride a bicycle across a 3 lane street with tram tracks going on each side of the street...in fact most people are smart enough to not do this- smart kids have a strong survial instinct. its mostly adults that do that kind of stuff. if i see a kid i go really really slow...because thats what any responsible and reasonable person would do.

[quote="Nordle, post:60, topic:67181"]
you‚Äôre not forced to ride a dangerous 2kW? skateboard in such an area.
[/quote]

no, im not forced to ride a 2kw esk8...i do this voluntarily and i'm perfectly aware of the dangers and hazards that come along with it. thats why it ticks me off as a responsible person when people act like jerks and do stupid stuff that risks another persons health. in this case my health was at risk.

so just in case i havent made myself clear enough this time around.

you are responsible for your own safety and for the safety of others by acting responsibly in a shared space.

"you are responsible for your own safety and for the safety of others by acting responsibly in a shared space"

These thoughts are not directed at you. I'm not saying you did this.

Hey there @slick I feel you frustration.
When we have a "by the grace of god moment" it release lots of chems into our blood adrenalin. 
Add that to need to let your frustration be felt or vented can lead to much worse situations.

Its not you fault. If you had of been 5 mins longer or shorter in the shower breakfast on the phone etc  you would not have been there. Someone else might have, and been seriously hurt.
I see moments or events like this as small miracles that happen everywhere everyday.

Another scenario all be it an unlikely one. The fool on the bike had just spent 10 years recovering from some accident not his own fault, doctors told him he would never walk again. Only through guts and determination and much pain he had recovered enough to go for his first ride. 
His parents, girlfriend and his dog all have tears in there eyes as he sets off.

Later he nearly hits you.  He did something stupid, poor judgement hadn't ridden in 10 years, there were no trains around then etc we will never know or in your case want to. lol

He is still in the wrong, in Aus he has right of way lol, it's not your fault.

There are no answers.

I have a punching bag, I lay into it till I feel better. When you get fatigued you loose you technique and you can hurt yourself. If you don't have any training it's safer to use your elbows and knees.

cheers
