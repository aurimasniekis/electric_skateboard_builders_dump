Of course @longhairedboy would notice me riding in my combat boots ðŸ˜‹ that brought me to the question of what do you prefer to use for a riding shoe? 

I came off of being a snowboarder most of my life so it always seemed natural to me to have a boot for the ankle support. I like to think that my boots help with the ride stability at high speeds and feel less confident boarding in shoes without that support.

I always found it interesting that the majority of boarders ride in shoes, why do you all prefer the footwear you use when you board, what advantages do you feel you gain from it?

If you ride in Austria with those you would be instantly classified as "Nazi" :laughing:
Back to the topic. I use my board as my daily commute and I usually only wear normal shoes, I personally don't need any ankle support. :joy:
Just my personal preference...

Vans, because they're awesome. They just allow more board feel vs other shoes.

Using the worst thing possible, namely fila "running" shoes. No connection with the board (got used to it), but I can easily ride 30 km off-road without breaking a sweat and wish I could go twice that distance.

No shoes is my preference, but not something i do every time. I prefer to feel the road, the board, and everything. Unless i'm riding really fast and then its vans, but derp speed (<20 mph) gets the barefoot. I group ride in shoes to avoid arguments and set an example, though sometimes those shoes are flip flops because fuck you. Vans because they don't lose grip and i can sense everything better in them than other shoes. However, they tire my feet quickly. 

I actually get less foot fatigue barefoot than i do with Vans with inserts, Nike Air, or even those floofy generic running shoes. Not talking about Vans inserts, either. I got the high dollar Dr Scholl's "i stand all day at my industrial job" inserts.

I ride 20 to 30 miles at a time on trails and back streets like that, so burning calves and sore feet are too familiar.

not particular shoes but i prefer relatively rigid sneakers with some amount of drop heel to toe.  don't know why, i just like the feeling of being on my toes on the board.

also rigid sides so feet don't move around inside the shoe as you're carving or coming to a stop.

so these [nike free rn](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81vSOYyLyWL._SX480_.jpg) i wear nearly everyday are not great for riding since they're neither rigid or have any drop.

For where I grew up, its just the color of the laces you got in your boots! (Hasn't been that way in a while though)

Alot of the skin head punks back in the scene wore boots with white laces or red laces, depending on their "stature" in their gang, or something they did to earn the red.

My boots, I threw either black or grey in there just to avoid shit when I was hanging in that scene. Now, I really DGAF, if I think red laces look cool, I'll throw them in.



but @Lunasi, I can ride in either, I prefer riding in a higher top skate shoe. My currents are the TNTs though, I really like them for being a lower top, and they are bright ass pink which is pretty rad IMO.

These are my main boots with some Dr. Marts mixed in every now and then.

![boots|500x500](upload://mwbnIDE0uupxvw5uo4xaHPae15T.jpeg) They are called Jump boots, its what our countries paratroopers wear.

The ones I have have a steel toe and a steel shank running down the sole. I call them either my "snake stompers" or my "shit kicker" boots.

Now I still get "avoided" every now an then, I was in D.C. the other day and had my boots on and a jean vest with a misfits patch on it, and some lady chased me to tell me how dangerous it is to listen to that music and she was worried for my soul, it was hilarious.

This response is based off my impression that boots, while comfortable, are not as flexible and kill the feeling under your feet. 

I like to be able to wiggle my feet and feel my board. There are lots of sneakers that give me a really detailed feel of my board and it's concave. All the boots I've tried don't do that. With sneakers/shoes, I can bend my ankles freely. I can foot brake effectively. With boots, I lose perspective of the road when foot braking and they restrict my movement when getting low. This is just my impression. 

Then you wreck wearing sneakers and your ankles get **fucked**. Therefore, high top sneakers are king for me. I'm sure there are suitable boots, I just always wore sneakers and every time I tried anything else it didn't feel right.

yep. Van's high tops with all that padding on the ankle is what i have. They're saved my skin there so many times i can't even count. 

i need my ankles too. My stance is such that i never stand flat footed completely. My heel and toe on my left foot (front foot) are mostly in contact but my heel and arch is where the weight is, and on my right foot i'm on the ball of my foot (which is in the gutter of my concave) and my toes are feeling the edge of the deck. When i carve right i can tuck down and push on the edge of the deck, when i carve left i can shift my back foot down and push on the opposite edge of the deck while my heels finds the other gutter, allowing me to carve hard enough at speed to slide just a little to make the turn then lock it back in on acceleration.  Boas don't really want to slide, either, so i can really lean on that shit.

Back in the day I installed some 12 hole doc martens on a pair of quad skates and was the man.  All my pals had hockey boots and I had the big boppers on there.  Now I wear converse all stars for that non existent placebo ankle support but at least you can feel the deck.  Could not imagine boarding in a pair of docs.  Still have a pair so going to try it for science.

I prefer low shoes, I have a slight obsession with Converses, so usually I wear that. The problem with boots is the slightly higher heel, so the feel of the board is odd (maybe you get used to it?) Shoes seems better just because if you tuck, a bit of ankle movement is needed.

This weekend I met a guy who rides with Vibram toe shoes, I guess that would be a good fit if you want to really feel the board. Might give that a try since I have a pair, my concern would be emergency foot stop or run off...might break off a toe.

On this same day there was also the guy who ate it, scrapped up arm and leg, but also was limping back to the parking lot because his shoelace ripped off when he fell and tumbled. So I guess boots might've held up better?

yes, there is. the vans inserts aren't as.. serious i guess... about vibrational damping when riding over long distances. I think maybe its because the dr scholls were designed for standing 9 hours a day and the vans were more designed for skating, which is much different pushing on longboards or in skate parks than on long distance rides on an esk8, and happens in bursts or sessions.

If I have a choice, my two favourite sneakers to ride in are my Adidas EQTs:

...or my reebok furylites:
![image|690x426](upload://zqbNPnwI2XojkbdQigr8xzJI9Y8.jpeg) 

But because I use my board to get to work, often I just end up wearing whatever Iâ€™m wearing for work... which is how I ended up riding in a brand new pair of these yesterday: (would not recommend)

I wore vans back in the late 90's, then I went converse for the next 20 years. I finally got a pair of Vans "TNT Advanced Prototype" for better padding and vibration dampening. The sole was so grippy I don't think I would need grip on my boards

For me with my boots I just feel like I can set a power stance and get better control of the board, helps when I hit a big crack going 30mph. My first esk8 was also a leiftech so the support really helped when using the freebord bindings.

Is it possible to have a pair of shoes in your backpack so you can switch them after your ride? I assume most people have backpacks or some sort when using their boards for commute.

Oh yeah, for sure I could fit my work shoes in my backpack. I definitely considered it.

But my ride to work is like 5 minutes... plus a few minutes of turning everything on, putting on gloves and helmet at each end. Changing shoes would probably mean Iâ€™d spend more time switching between work and riding attire than actually riding! Riding in dress shoes isnâ€™t THAT bad, just not ideal.

Think high tops. 
Normally vans sk8 hi pros.
But I've got PFFlyers that work well too.
Anything that covers the ankle and allows me to feel the concave of my deck.
Especially on fast turns, i like to be able to wrap my toes or heal around the deck.

I personally have landed on Nike SB after trying lots of skate shoes and insoles...my insoles are still a secret sauce yet posted here somewhere deep. the Nike SB's hold up longer than vans and other skate shoe brands, at least in my experience. they didn't look very durable to me but the proof is in the pudding, they last the longest and are very comfortable and lightweight. I need to get another pair here soon, I'm on my third pair already after finding the model I like. Insoles for eskating are wonderful and most skateboarding insoles work perfectly fine. For super long range eskating I prefer a more vibration damping solution made for the job.

Footwear is my biggest pet peeve.
1. Must be able to run fast in them to bail properly.  Either run it out, slide into second base feet first, or stick a foot and then risk sticking the head like a lawn dart.  When possible, running is always the best way to bail.
2. I prefer proper skate shoes (Vans, Fox, DC, etc.) but I can run it out in my rubber-soled dress shoes when I skate to work, dress slacks and all.  Running shoes don't give me the same feel with my toes because the sole is rounded.  What do you see downhill racers wear?  What do you see in skate parks?

With that, if you can bail safely in boots I'll judge you more favorably than those wearing running shoes, slippers or sandals.

Tangent comment: I swear by Superfeet insoles, more for walking and sports in general than skating.  The ground is flat; feet aren't.  Solid structure that matches the flat ground with our curved arches is the way it should be.

Because its normally too hot to wear shoes. I have only lost a little toe skin in two years, mostly due to noob mistakes I would not do again.

If its winter I wear skate shoes. I feel much safer in shoes and can go around corners faster without my feet feeling like they will fly off.

Sanuk Men's TKO Loafer, Brindle

https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N5JO971/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_ccu.BbP67QQVG

The whole brand of Sanuk is incredible. All their soles are made from yoga mats and some other materials. Most comfortable things you can wear. Fits like vans/Tom's but with a cloud attached to the bottom. I currently have 32 pairs between me and my wife and I'm proud to say majority are mine haha

+1 for anything Adidas skateboarding - they're generally my fav. Specifically love any SPZL shoe by them. they have soles like indoor soccer shoes which makes them great for feel but still capable of taking a beating. 

Also +1 for converse allstar hightops 

when it gets cold cold I wear vans MTE hightops

edit - I recommend getting some Dr. Scholls heel Gels for long rides.

Gazelles have been my standard downhill shoes forever. I have tried others but none can tick all the boxes like gazelles. They last a long time, give true board feel ,  last well with regular foot braking, protective top (leather materials rather than cloth) comfortable and look cool.

Deck shoes, mainly Van's sk8hi's. Gotta keep those ankles from turning into slide pucks. 

First thing new riders notice is their feet getting numb because there feet are still full of weak sauce from never skating before. Ride more! The numbness goes away. Flat shoes with very little padding is what you want.

Repeat after me! "skateboarding is not snowboarding", but riding in docs is still dope as fuck!  :metal:

since its winter and cold, and my board is a commuter.... 
i work outdoors for extended periods of time, on those days I wear a heavier boot with insulation and thats just what i happen to be riding with that... but theyre stiff and not as responsive as shoes which i prefer.. 

snowboarding is similar yes, but different as we have bindings which help the board respond quick to to carving cues.

I bend my rear toe a lot when I ride, take into account that I ride a lot faster than most do. Just cruising ... sure, you can get away with locking your heels in and carving but high speed riding is way different. 

Check my stance here, if I rode like a snowboarder through a turn like that at 30 mph the rear end would start oscillating.

Exactly this. But I think it boils down to the type of board I'm riding. A street/PU board I really can't ride with anything aside from my Vans. 

On my AT boards or for commuting, I wear my very well broken in motorcycle boots with ankle supports. Has saved my ankles a few times in bailouts and overall I feel like I can get into a better "power stance" for 25+
