Waiting on the remotes from the group buy I started to play with the numbers and found some really nice sealed motors and vescs 4.12.

I'm wondering if there is a **magic** number on these things...that will break your will power, but not your wallet! ;)

To get a custom run with all the right specs I would need to get at least 50 motors.
Non Final Specs:
6354 motor with silicone wires, 4mm bullets, jst-ph sensors.
KV: 200 
Max. power: 2450W 
Battery type: 6-10S (12s should be fine too)
Diameter(mm): 63.4
Length(mm): 57
Shaft(mm): 8 with keyway
Weight: 558g
Idle current: 1.3A
Motor Resistance: 0.053Ohm 

Color: all black or Grey/silver
Branding: minimal logo

Estimated time: 2-4 weeks after cleared payments.
Price: 
6354 ............ $54
Vesc 4.12 .... $77 (includes $1 to vedder)
Shipping US .... $7 (1 motor) / $15 ( 2 - 3 motors)
Shipping Int. .... $23 Econ/ $32 priority (up to 2 motors)
