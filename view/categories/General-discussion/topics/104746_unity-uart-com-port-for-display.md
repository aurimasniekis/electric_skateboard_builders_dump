Has anyone used the open ports on the unity for anything? It looks like the Com port is SPI or i2c. I cant find any parameters in the terminal to program them. What can they be used for? I have a OLED display that is a 1351 7-pin SPI that I would like to use to display battery voltage. Wondering if I can use the Com port. ![Unity%20Pic|666x500](upload://czoyZQw8SM0xbpMdSiR4SkUsKgd.jpeg)
