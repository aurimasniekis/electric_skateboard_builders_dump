This is all of the nominations for the [Best Build of 2018](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/best-build-of-2018-nominations/79465?u=mmaner) as of 10:30AM CST 1/2/2019.  

The only rules that have been applied are that each build must be completed by Midnight GMT 12/31/2018 and each build must have a build thread (I've been very liberal with this one, if I could find anything related to the build its been included).

Poll's are limited to 20 options, so I've broken this down into to categories, Pro & Builder.  Pro is for people that build boards professionally for profit, Builder is for regular folks that build boards for themselves and friends/family.  If I have miscategorized someone please let me know ASAP, I've done my best to figure out who is who.

There were a couple of build that didn't have a name, at least I could not find it, so they have been listed as (build unnamed), if you have or no the name of these boards let me know and I'll get it posted.

After 7 days I will end the poll and the winners will get a nifty 3D printed trophy and a some swag.  If there is any interest I will create another poll with the winner from each category for an overall winner.

I took my board and @anorak234's board out of the poll since we are both forum leaders, seamed like the fair thing to do.  Heres the link to each build in ase you wanna take a look.

I will take time to read and see itch board before to vote ;) 

**Good luck folks** :v:

EDIT : @mmaner  so you prefer the Kushboard, Kushboard Jr, or the Kushboard Titan ? :P I really like the Jr, beautifull setup and finish, but as I prefer pneumies, I agree to vote the Titan ^^

That build had a bug inpact on the community.  I learned a shitload from it and still reference it occasionally.

That was so frigging difficult to choose...

1. I don't have the knowledge skills to know the nuances/problems encountered  that had to be solved.
2. So much talent skill displayed.
3. Trying not to be bias to my favourite people and parts used.

I failed miserably...my sincere congratulations to all nominated....

There's thousands of users on this forum, 120'ish votes. Y'all go vote, show some love. 

BTW, this is going to be a yearly occurrence from now on.  Next December I'm going to start a wiki thread where all the submissions will go as individual messages which will include pics and text, the poll entry will link to each message individually.

It will have the benefit of having all the data in a single thread so users can scroll through it and be notified of new entries plus each submission will have only the pertinent data and not all the conversation that happens in build threads.

Lastly, vendors are donating prizes.  Good prizes too, I'm.so pumped!

Moe literally fabricated every part of his board people. He designed, made by hand and perfected a 100% custom, completely off the charts different to everything else here board.

These votes are extremely confusing to me but I suppose everyone has an opinion.

For some it is about power, for others about comfort, for some others looks etc.
Most have a formula in their mind with all of the above as variables but different weight coefficients.

Agreed. After voting I thought hold on a minute. I simply voted the prettiest board and not the best build which this poll is about, in which case you should really read each and every build thread which I haven‚Äôt done since I don‚Äôt like all the decks.

Whipping round the forum buying up the trending parts and assembling it all does not compare with designing and then machining all your parts from scratch.  Building it and then breaking records with it surely must qualify for the best build.  Come on chaps lets reward a true innovator  @MoeStooge
You get my vote.

That‚Äôs true, and if innovative design was what we all were basing our votes on, his would hands down be the winner. That‚Äôs what makes voting so difficult. Each nominated build should win for its own reasons. In the end, I just picked the ones I liked the most. And this year, it‚Äôs been about the mini cruiser for me. 
Also, huge shout out to @Sender for the city slicker build. Was one of my all time faves. Should be in the build hall of fame, along with a bunch of others.

It's all good, just keep it fun. This thread wasn't meant to say anyone's build was bad, just name the one that the community thinks is best. 

I mean, I feel like my 'Hazzard' build is the most fun I've ever had on a board with the small wheels, low center of gravity, and it looks awesome. But it's not the fastest nor the most innivative so I'm sure it wouldn't have won. 

Regarsless, I think it's the best build of 2018. But how many people think that about their own builds?

I definitely hear you about the boards. Mine is not innovative at all. However I will say that this was my first build and first eboard so going from the push boards to this that would have killed me if I hadn‚Äôt worn a helmet. It has definitely lived up the the crazed lunatic that is the joker.

Plus this was my first attempt at blending colors with my posca pens. I have some new parts to it either they have gone on or will be going on soon. Including riptide pivot cups and bushings, popoca and custom x braces from @akhlut that I just finished doing today. I‚Äôll be posting pics on my Instagram tomorrow of them.

Hey my friend listen there is no malice here toward you.  Its just friendly banter.  Consider yourself worthy of it rather than take offence.  Its testament to how familiar people feel with you that allows the ragging.  Revel in it and start telling us to go fxxk ourselves.   I love the graphics on your board and its a great build.  :sunglasses:

I like how you split it into builders and pros. In future years maybe this could grow into more categories. It‚Äôs cool that this is gonna be an annual thing. 

Can‚Äôt help but think there was probably some awesome builds in January and February which were forgotten by the time nominations started. 

Maybe the nomination list could be a work in progress throughout the year this year? It‚Äôd be an awesome review of the entire year, and reminder of some of the awesome work completed by members. Build of the year chosen from 12 builds of the month?

We could even do a 2020 calendar üòÇ

I think that is getting to specific. I could see most innovative, best looking or on the reverse side most ratchet but would have to be self nominated for the ugly side. Because even the ugly girls need some love too.

Then it will turn into a thing where every board that wins has pneumatics and no tail.

Most of the time when I ride, I want a short board with a tail, without pneumatics.  Sometimes I want a long heavy board, but not most times, because I'm not going more than a few miles.

So then this contest turns into a "bling festival" instead of "best practical machine".

I strongly encourage at least some categories.

I'm all for categories, but best practical machine is very subjective. I think street, hybrid and AT should be sufficient?

I think tail is the most important of all of them

With tail (at least 13cm / 5.1" from bolts)
Without tail

Because these builds differ significantly with different challenges

I look at it like this.  160 votes, 8% of the vote...that's 12 people that think your board is the best board that has been built this year.  That's damned cool in my opinion :slight_smile:.

I was never in it I was at 1% from the beginning but it was my first build and definitely not the prettiest on the the under side with the ying yang mounts but from the top it look damn good. and I didn't blow up my DRV or blow any parts so win win.  I have idea's for another build but have to convince my wife to let me spend more on parts.  Would love some surfrodz and sixshooters to give me a nice smooth ride so maybe next time.

Congratulations to all those nominated, just being here means you've got a badass board.

Both winners will be receiving a small trophy, which I 3D printed and painted.  Plus the Builder winner will be receiving a small prize pack with some items from me and from some vendors here on the forum.  

The Pro winner doesn't get a prize pack, as this win will obviously increase his sellability 100 fold :).

See you guys later this year when we do it again :slight_smile:.

I know this js no big deal, but it is truly flattering to have people vote on my build, and I really appreciate it everybody!

Though, I still think the amazing ground up build by Alpha by @ashe or the insanely influential Master Evo by @Deckoz are my favorites!



Now lets make 2018 builds look like amateur hour in 2019!!!

Ouff forgot to vote I wanted to Look at each build first, I'll probably still go ahead and so so. 

Suggestions for 2019's:

What if there were categories beyond boards Like a category for innovator of the year , best customer service , best bro/sis etc and the winner can wear the title like it says for regulars?
