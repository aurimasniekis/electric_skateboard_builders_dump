I would be down. I'm surprised there is no facebook group or other organized esk8 thing in Philly cause I see DIY's, Boosted's, and other E-boards in Center City and University City all the time. I'm currently having inconsistent issues with my battery pack and may need to get a new pack but I'm in Center City and when my board works right I can get around 7 miles range

Mornings are best for me.  I can either take the train down or drive.  Only mention that for possible starting locations.  Ride and grab some breakfast or lunch?  I've been craving lunch at Jack's Firehouse.

Hey guys.  I'm no eboarder but I own an electric unicycle and I'm about 30 mins outside Philly.  I can't find a single EUC rider in my area or Philly.  If you guys want another rider one day let me know, I'm always looking for people to ride with.  I generally go on long rides and understand you guys need to charge and stop a bit more and that's fine.  If anyone wants to ride let me know.

Chris

I am also looking to see if there are any ESkate builders in Philly as well. Please let me know! I am a rider and attempting to complete my first build. Please let me know if any of you guys are still around.
