# #S#P enclosures e.g. 12s4p based on spin state?

I couldn't help but think back to my old and seldom used chemistry degree when seeing these enclosures for batteries are often denoted by a spin state. Is there any connection there or a fun tongue-in-cheek nod to electron spin states?

Granted, it's been awhile since I've done any NMR, but old refresher table for spin states found on the google makes me think it's more of a marketing ploy - yes?

S= Series, P=Parallel

It's a denotation of the way that the batteries are connnected, series adds their voltages together, while parallel adds their amperages.

Thanks guys. I should have thought more about transferring energy and less about electrons from a chemical standpoint.
