This was made a while back. I saw it on the Boosted Reddit. I love the Tesseract! That is the board I want to make an eBoard. The Boosted electronics looks awfully weird on it though.

Yeah it's a ton of money, but hopefully, I can get one used and make it look "new" again :P 

Which one do you want exactly? The truncated tesse right?

Personally I like the look of the truncated one better but I feel like I would really like the kicktail. I use the kicktail a lot on my current board for tight turns

Yeah for me it is either the Truncated or Cantellated one. The regular one is pretty ugly lol. 

There is a guy selling complete one on Craigslist nearby for $150, but he has failed to respond! So mad :angry:

I just got my truncated tesseract. It is sexy. Kinda wish I bought a kicktail though.

Holy! ;\ I might get a deal for ~$100. 

Did you ride it yet? I'm not sure if I would even like it since I am used to riding a Vanguard. Looks nice however.
