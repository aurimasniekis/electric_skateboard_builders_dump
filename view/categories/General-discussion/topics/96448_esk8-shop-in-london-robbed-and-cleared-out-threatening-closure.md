this is such bad news for Wick and the whole London/UK esk8 community :frowning:

I have so much respect for the guys at Wick and what they have done, I feel sick hearing this news

yup, but tbh its unlikely they will be caught.

I fully expect the police to leap into inaction, the few officers available will be too busy handing out penalty notices to raise revenue. not much profit in solving robberies.

the rest of the force in hackney are dealing with acid attacks, stabbings and shootings
