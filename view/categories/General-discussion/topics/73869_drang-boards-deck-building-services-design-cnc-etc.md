Okay, been riding electronic boards now for about 1 year. It is about high time I create my own skate deck with accommodations for battery components.  With the CNC machine, it is very simple work.  I plan to do this with a number of boards in the coming weeks.  The Eskate market still doesn't have a good kicktail longboard deck.  That is what I want most.  That being said we can build boards for anything.  Let me give you a basic run down of what Drang is, and does. 
We are a shop with a business model that works VERY well for direct to end user sales, and great for shop sales, with a bit of doubt being cast on traditional OEM price structure where we need to cut the price down to 25-35% of retail price.  That's a bit of a stretch for us and must be planned well.  I'd rather not do OEM however it's the evil we can't seem to escape. 
 Don't want to get myself in trouble saying that, but we do want to change the culture of this, because Factories really contribute SO much to this experience.  Now, we have a very capable shop with the following equipment: (I am going to post pictures in this thread later, but with interest of time, I'm posting this now.)

6 pneumatic bladder presses capable of laminating at over 100 psi with either male female molds, or female only molds. This allows us to press new concaves with or without heat.  We laminate with Bamboo, Maple, Carbon Fiber, Fiberglass, ect.

2 Hydraulic presses operational, and 2 more being built.  (used for conventional lamination in male female configuration)  Some boards must be laminated with M/F molds, because of steep deeep kicktails, or drops.  

Fully modular female only molding system with accommodations for many types/depths of concave, rocker, drops, wheel flares, w concave, kicktails in any configuration, assembled by hand for one off or small group runs.   Basically this means you can think up any concave configuration, and we can create it in an hour or so of assembly.  

CNC build molds/CNC fixture hold down jigs for cutting/drilling/routing boards on the CNC table. We have between 20 and 30 molds ready for production.  I'll see about relaying info on these (screen shots of each mold) surface in design. 

Full hand building tool set, Routers, Sanders, ect, for cutting decks using flat wood templates after drilling truck holes.  Flush mount rig for any deck,  Wheel well templates for many different wheel well designs. 

Legit spray booth for coating boards with vertical exhaust.  

DTG printer hacked to be able to print onto wood plies before they are pressed as decks.  This allows for one off graphics or group runs. 

Laser engraving services and grip tape cutting.  

Vinyl stencil plotter

5'x8'x10" CNC router, (10hp motor) with vacuum suction hold down table. We cut boards in 4 different zone on the table.  

Full design services, Rhinoceros 6 CAD capable 

Full graphic design services, Adobe full suite available (Illustrator and Photoshop mostly)

Industrial glue spreader we don't currently operate but we want to if we get into doing "mass production".  

More to add later.

Please keep in touch and update us as much as possible! I am currently working on starting a company building high performance boards part time and many others are already doing what I aspire to do. I would love to work with someone who could make custom decks in the future like @longhairedboy, but I really don‚Äôt want to have to press and cut decks myself or each individual build will just take too long. I currently am using a 38 Switchblade as the deck for my flagship build because I love the way it locks your feet in place in the drops but I want to make many designs.

@redemberboards is already in the game, but I think there is more than enough business to go around. Eskating is only gonna get bigger from here!

moonshine contacted me talking about thier new waterproof process and i was like "take my mold and make me some decks" and they were like "bro, we're not on that scale" and i said "don't fucking bro me fine then don't make thousands of the most awesome concave ever and profit from it while solving my issue" and then they started asking more questions. 

i don't know man, they bro'd me. not sure how i feel about those guys now.

Honestly it‚Äôs frustrating to work with companies without any foresight. Just because the initial order might be small doesn‚Äôt mean that there won‚Äôt be a larger order in a few months. For example, tone I hear from local plastics companies when I ask to buy 4‚Äôx8‚Äô sheets of ABS 1 or 2 at a time is ridiculous. When I tell them what I am doing they seem to think it‚Äôs some kind of joke.

[/quote]


its a custom soft dome w-concave with a camber to the hump, nice deep gutters for the heel and ball of your foot and it lends itself nicely to several cutout shapes, some with snub tails. I've been told it slides well. 

I'm looking for somebody to take my mold and press my shit for me and deliver nice 11" x 44" rectangular blanks i can stack up and carve whenever i'm ready into whatever i want. Or to carve them for me as well, that's fine too.

That sounds like up our alley, depending on all things obviously.  I'd like to speak with you about it.  Questions I'd have are is this a CAD designed mold?  If so it would be easy for us to program to cut for you.

Well the main point when discussing this board is this:  E Skates have huge wheels, and tons of riser compared to most non powered boards.  Most non powered boards already don't have huge rudder style tails on the back, and what the ride height change does for boards with kicks is to demand the kicktail be bigger longer and slap a bit earlier. I recently put my dasher 36.5" deck on my funing electric, and it was OH SO MUCH FUN!  That was with 70-75mm wheels and no risers, and it rode basically like a longboard which I loved.  This was about a year ago, and I rode that set up into the ground, dragging tail and riding wheelies all over town![dasher%20side|690x354](upload://jeOd2LzZK5E5EpaK03q9SvvMQG8.jpeg) ![Dasher%20complete%20render|690x367](upload://x7vobr68i3QcOJpQqvFZ6iRvhdm.jpeg) ![2017%20dasher%20multishot|690x366](upload://qQQWAr7I5aXNPEKEN10dx0w95KJ.jpeg) ![2017%20dasher%20p%20shot|666x500](upload://5w7c3rcJIDZIIzumHIxB6RHe25d.jpeg) ![Dasher%20complete|666x500](upload://pq89SR8xEqwQdEzSfTEPkbGBX2t.jpeg)

Gonna be doing testing to figure out what breaks.  I'd love to see what some others have learned.  We hand apply glue which means more of it stays between plies, instead of being squeezed out and I don't care what anyone says about how squeeze out should happen, it makes a stronger board having more glue left inside the laminate obviously. So we'll see what sort of routing can happen in an 8 ply, 9 ply, and then in composite laminates with FG or CF on the outsides of the deck.  I'm sure our laminates can take much abuse, as we rarely see a broken deck.

Your at the right place honestly. If you want something bullet proof and good speeds and range you should build from scratch.

So what are you looking for here? Guidance on what deck you should make? Or just displaying your skills?

There are a few esk8 decks out there but none that have a kicktail that would be a good place to start.

I want to put a board on the market.  Obviously v1 will be what I ride for a while, and that's my selfish interfacing, but I want to find a place in the industry where our business can thrive.  E Skates has so much new stock for good reasons, (hills at the push of a button) so naturally I am drawn to it.  I love riding, but I can't be a hill rat, my life revolves around my work, and it is the best way to have fun between shifts.  I want to get into advanced propulsion.  

Step number one is to build myself a badass set up from scratch, and also to offer Drang's services to the people in this thread.  

IF I were to get what I want right now in a board, it would be 30mph, and batteries that can take me at least down town, and back maybe if I'm lucky, which is 8 miles away.  

I've been talking to Adam0311 for a bit now, and building decks for some of his builds (one can be seen here https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/easy-custom-deck-options/49555/8 )

This is possible. You could get most parts delivered in the US and all you need to do is read a lot about esk8s and assemble stuff.

For the decks - what's stopping you from making a kicktail deck where the bottom of the deck has a milled out section for electronics? I sent you a PM a couple days ago and I linked the jet spur deck made by @whitepony

Yeah - I am not an hardcore longboarder like some of you people here.

But as a community you would get a lot information and you should be able to build a great deck with the given info.

You can create polls on this forum btw, so u could create the thread - what's features make up the ideal commuter deck. And then ask a bunch of questions in the poll, wheel base, concave, length, kictail length etc, material choice..

Although admittedly you might have a large spread of answers because people are so different and esk8 usually means sacrifices.. not many people have the opportunity to work with an actual deck maker. Exceptions of course, treenuttee and lhb

And then ride it yourself and have beta tester

Nothing is stopping us.  I'd like to let people know that any CNC built mold we use of which the deck can be held to the CNC table (via vacuum hold down fixture) can have anything carved into the bottom of it.  I want to get people who want to make orders, and get started.  

The coolest thing about Drang is that we've built probably a few thousand completely different decks, from the concave geometry to the shape.  ![1a%20all%20shapes%20neo|690x298](upload://4UAObxHQYCLkQcDDCNb1uAkv7oU.png) We have probably 150-200 hand shaping templates, and have maybe 300-350 CAD designed shapes we've used at least once on any given mold. ![CAM00234|666x500](upload://r1Sj0xO8GEDzZvPUSSZxcCWMtI3.jpeg) ![CAM00313|666x500](upload://uxRU7PzCHuLb7BEUlpLMhOjZgnA.jpeg) ![CAM00238|375x500](upload://3pH0QFEGbT8YoWEs72ikdvlyGef.jpeg) 

These are old pictures, but I'll try to get crazy about sharing on here.  What I think I'd like to do most is get a bunch of people who want to go in on a design together, then build those boards together.  Adam0311 makes really nice battery cases, and we're already working on the next version of his deck which will have bottom routing for lower profile (maybe up to .25" savings) so I'd love to work with him on that, and assembly for the time being.

I'm proficient in CAD design, and we can cut any molds with which to laminate various components.

The custom deck they built me is extremely versatile. Super stable at speed, can handle 30+mph, carving is a blast with the concave , a nice wide kick tail so its very agile around the city. Love it. Actually building a couple more for friends.

I‚Äôm sure Drang can do it for you. The link Jared @drangboards attached earlier has my order sheet specs. I have a 10s3p with plenty of room. 10s4p would fit easily without changing the wheel base (possibly a 12s4p as well) and you could bigger by increasing the wheelbase. I think my wheel base is a only 24.5 lots of room to move it back. It‚Äôs a great deck and very comfortable for long rides. I‚Äôve done several 30mile days on it.

As Jared said, I‚Äôve got them working on another deck with the same specs plus a cnc cutout approximately 8mm deep for the battery/esc/receiver. I‚Äôm actually thinking about a deeper cutout with cf or fiberglass layer to add strength for a potential double stack battery on future builds.

 Feel free to jump on, I‚Äôm sure @drangboards would appreciate maximizing their efforts with volume orders.

Just out of curiousity (at least for the time being), could you do a hollow deck so batteries could be stored on the inside like this?
https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/haya-integrated-deck/68132

Also, could you maybe use a CNC to remove 1/4in of wood from the back of the deck so an enclosure wouldn‚Äôt need to be as large for more clearance?

It would be cool to get some group skates together, and even group build efforts.

I have this CAD re-built deck I've been working on.  I was going to try to press the board home-diy and CNC hog out a battery recess in it over the next few months. It's based off a 3D scan of the Rayne 34" Darkside V2. I was just going to do a one off build over the next year for myself -  Not sure how this would all work if it were basically copying Rayne's board for another business. If there's no such thing as a longboard patent then I'd be happy to share the STP file for it. 

It currently has enough to fit a 12s3p pack (with some funny wiring), a DieBieMS, and a Focbox Unity. The dropped center in the deck might present some motor mount interference issues though... tbd on that one.

That is really cool that you've done that.  It looks like an very solid design, with all aspects considered.  I'd like to say that we'd be down to do that, but by principle I won't duplicate any concave.  If you ask my opinion on that concave specifically I'd have changes I'd make as well, so that's another strong reason too as to why no copies will be built.  Here is a mold I'd really love to make into an eskate.  It is a longer board slightly, but the mold is much less aggressive specifically in concave angle.  When decks start to get extra risers, and taller wheels, the concave angle must be lowered.  I'm sure that Rayne deck would work great for an eboard, but I'd just rock slightly lower angle of concave.  I might be speaking out my ass on the concave angle of that deck because the only one I've ever stood on was maybe the 2014 model or earlier.  Rocker however is something that will really weaken the board when routing out for batteries.  This one is a no rocker board with .375" drops, Wheel base is 25-27.  Flush mounts are used to get a wider riding stance which is really nice for E boards as the forward and aft acceleration is much greater than with non powered boards.  ![PNG|690x381](upload://cCIWLZ2apOqUUewB5xlP3bKjioC.jpeg) 

There are so many other shapes we can use with any deck.  CNC fixtures allow for any shape to be cut out of any mold.

Are you Q? 

I think I might need to renew it, or check the license to see if Mr Nelson included this amount of time still, or more appropriately how much he wrote it for.  

I think I only have the Batray mold file, but I might have more.  I am very interested in producing our version of it.  One thing I might be able to say specially over the winter which will help make the boards reasonably quick time in the press is to use the Nelson mold which has extra geometry in it in my opinion.  Might be able to pull boards out of the press at 2 hours and have them come out somewhat regularly. as long as the same person laminates all of them and that would be Jordan, who has laminated decks for us for 6 years.  He's glued by far more boards than all of us, and even though we're good, he's really good, and we have a very low rate of breakage as long as geometry doesn't conflict with deep flush mounts, and wheel wells.  We also have a low rate of delamination.  The same dialog must be had with the interplay between wood and composite materials to press time to resulting geometry.  I might want to keep all the geometry, as I've never stood on a batray but I imagine esk8s want to be wider the wider the axle gets, and that means lower angle molds.  

I really love getting PMs, but I would appreciate all dialog to happen on this page, so that these questions can be answered to more people might be seeking these answers, both for people who want to build boards them selves, and people who want to sell them, and we can all together gauge this as a reasonable possibility for a sustainable business being added to the mix.  

The most passionate of my wishes while I'm not working on other things is the idea of making an e board that is has a list of cool new ideas.

I for one would like to see new paths taken in place of rehashing old designs that did not succeed in the open marketplace.  It is important and wise to build on what has been done before but this is the eSk8 builders forum, let's do better, cutting edge things in place of going backwards

Maybe Nelson has already sold their old presses, but he offered them to me for a good price, last year.  If he still has them then we could use them and make molds on the CNC, but we'd love to be able to get the presses if they are still available.  We do have presses, but our female only molds might not even do the exact geometry if the deck is 9 plies thick.  If it was thinner with composites used, then we could probably get our presses to make the geometry cleanly, between the drop and the wrinkles in the concave ect.

I've spent 8 years going backwards in a well enough funded environment in order to build our capability as a shop.  We're still not in the $15 skate deck industry, and we're not in the $30 board industry truly.  Longboards are always more, and we can go down as qty goes up. As that happens other things become the issue than with building fewer boards.  Our business would do great selling one offs, and small groups.  Pressing some decks takes us 5 or 8 hours of press time depending on the lamination.  If we can get our glue spreader running we could run some real decks but we have to believe that lamination might not be as strong, but we need to ponder the differences between normal skate decks for tricks and aerial maneuvers and making strong decks with varying flex using varying materials.  Thickness plays the biggest roll in stiffness yadda yadda.  

If you're still reading, do you have designs concepts or ideas you want to see in powered skateboarding before fate has already set it in it's place?

As you know Jared, I am not a deck guy and I know what you are up against.  In my mind, price is far less important than feel, functionality and quality and you do get what you pay for.  I do not think I have a non powered deck in my quiver that costs less than $100.00. That being said, a purpose built line of eSk8 decks would be worth far more than that due to the additional engineering and functionality.  Even at $200.00, a perfect deck for a build with other top quality components that approach $2000.00 or more, the deck only represents 10% of the total cost but represents far more because it is **THE MAIN USER INTERFACE**

Thoughts on design:  eSk8 represents a different discipline where the riding techniques are still morphing at a fast rate.  Tucking and cornering under powered acceleration and deceleration warrant different deck designs than boards driven solely by gravity.  I am not claiming to know what those design elements are but it is time to find out.  Some mistakes need to be made to make progress...

Here Here Brad.  I am stoked to say the least, and have kept my stoke through these 8 years.  It is certain things are changing rapidly until things get homogenized in a good way to all function the way they should.  Innovations though are totally important.  

Regarding the license, I have the license still as long as we don't determine non use as  under use.  Not sure if Rich Laid out the under use clause or not, but If people want nelson boards the dialog there will continue.  Manufacturing with Drang might be not be exclusive in the contract, so other shops might wanna get in on that party too.  That being said I truly believe Drang to have the quickest and most economical way to get the molds and CNC fixtures built until that's not available anymore.

It makes skateboard decks really uncomfortable and that hurts over longer distances. Concave is useful for the feel of the deck and for turning, anything but a flat deck in the middle hurts badly over any amount of time, forget about W, bacon and lumpy type of concaves used in downhill, they just hurt and do nothing in eskates, but a nice sharp rail and edge all along the deck helps with feel and turns for sure...I prefer a wider deck, like 10 or 11 inches wide, so the concaves can be very mellow, remain comfortable and still be effective..

Just like push boards, everyone rides esk8s they‚Äôre own way. I carve my ass off on my esk8s, I actually build them so they‚Äôre fun to carve on. Just like @squishy654 said an aggressive concave gets uncomfortable on longer rides, but a mild concave on a wider deck with good grip tape (and dialed in bushings and trucks) and you can carve it up and have lots of fun while still being comfortable.

Depends on the concave and how aggressive it is. It‚Äôs a bit of a blanket statement to say concave = discomfort. I find concave like that on the Batray to be very comfortable because they actually hug your feet and allow you to exert minimal strain on your soles in order to turn the board. Concave also locks you in and allows you to relax your legs instead of constantly fighting against the vibrations trying to slide your feet off the deck. I own several decks on both end and of the spectrum, and the decks with the more aggressive concave tend to be way more comfortable for long rides.

Yay, I'm stoked there is a discourse happening.  So we have many decks, and the Nelson board, *(as long as Mr. Nelson is down to keep the contract going) will be presented in a group buy.  The retail price of the decks will be a bit more than the cost Nelson sold them for.  They will be CNC built, with an enclosure of some sorts.  Could do various types of them, but each one requires I charge the customer for design time.  We'll need to make about 5-600$ to make the mold, fixture, and do the programming for wheel wells, flush mounts, and the battery area.  

Kicktails on this mold are nearly 10" long if we need for huge wheel eskates.  
![image|690x375](upload://s3S2cdN1hhzKXO7XQ2uWbvdzhj9.png) 
I imagine that the concave is a bit aggro for some, specially the larger feet people or people who ride with their feet in a sideways position.  I tend to stand more towards teh middle of the board when I"m trying to go faster . This dialog is very valuable, and I want to continue it.  

If anyone is wondering...  Most any shape can be cut on any mold.  When we are hand building boards, we must make a wood template for the router to trace each shape, but with CNC built boards, any shape is fair game as long as the blank and the mold can support the shape.  Here are a few other shapes I rendered with the Nelson mold.

![image|690x405](upload://aolUbcaBdYKeU0RaMsdP6nkIgDA.png) 

This mold would make a VERY good cut out board, or a drop through board shape even, as long as teh wheel base was clear of the drop, and intended flush mount area.

Here is the rant and insider information about us here and now.  

The culture which creates the average price of skate/long board building is mostly set by over seas, or Mexican factories purchasing everything including labor in bulk and thus prices there are simply lower, Even Though they can often ship the raw goods from the USA and ship decks back for less than most small state side factories can make them domestically!  There is something wrong with that picture. 
 Shops in the USA and Canada are even at or near that level, with ultra efficient machines, and large teams pumping out a hundred or more decks per day.  Drang has been moving towards economizing the purchase of wood, and glue, and maybe even using our glue spreader which saves about 10 minutes in the press process.  We have found that until we are purchasing at least 1 full semi trailer full of maple, and 275 gallons of glue at once, the price of decks really just can't be compared to other factories who are completing 1000 or more boards per month.  Comparing the cost of man hours in the USA and cost of business, to that of overseas factories shows us we're not going to be the place to go to get the cheapest decks.  It will never be the case unless the cost of living in those other countries goes up or the quantity of boards we build per month quadruples.  I doubt shipping tariffs will ever really bridge that gap alone. 

I'd be so happy to see the day when the the culture of longboard manufacturing innovation becomes more amiable towards the survival of the factory in general, and specifically our factory.  We have sold 8 ply formica decks for $45, in bulk which basically means we're working about 1 hour theoretically on each board, for a total shop rate of $25-30.  Utah has a lower cost of living than many states but that shop rate isn't able to support a shop of our size (which isn't that big).  Here at Drang we are all owner operators who  live off of very low pay and put all our time into the building of the shop.   We have sacrificed quality of life for this for 8 years, so I hope you'll understand our desire and need to make good profit building high quality well designed boards.  

Retail price was $140 for the Bat Ray.  With our process of wheel well cut outs, flush mounts, and with the addition of a battery route, retail price isn't likely going to be lower.  It will probably be higher. There will be the ability to maybe do group discounts, and probably to sell to shops. (Though I can't remember if there is a legal clause for that).  Our contract with Nelson also includes compensation for Nelson. 

I did just receive word from Mr. Nelson himself, and it seems we're still on board.  So side note, we'll be releasing a group buy, with a minimum maybe even a kickstarter, and boards will be built and released some time around the new year.  

IF you are looking for a more affordable deck option, we'll be able to sell decks that don't take as much and we'll likely be able to be very reasonably priced.  We're between a little shop and a big factory in capacity.

I think the esk8 market is a great place for you my friend. Many, many people on this forum have spent thousands on building the boards they want to ride. Cost is always going to be a factor, but paying $50-$75 more for a deck that combines a great riding experience with esk8 accommodations like a routed battery section (or possibly routed lanes for phase wires) is a no brainer for me. I suspect many others will feel the same.

I just got a reply from Evolve, about the making of a local winter time race event.  I think we want to set it up so that we can have classes of races, for dudes like Moe, and anyone else on a rocket we can get out to race, and then standard boards, 20mph goers, and what not, and then a push race.  I think the funnest would be a tow race, where e boards pull longboarders around the track haha.  

I'll be emailing Evolve after the event is set up.  First thing is to discover how much money we need to raise in order to get a day, or evening at the track.  We have multiple local tracks here where we could hold the event.  I think there isn't a better time to do it than during winter while our winter jones is going on.

Who else should I email about this?  Red Ember, Long Haired Boy, Carvon?  Everyone?

Well, I'm back from an hour at the drawing board.  We have SO many molds which would make amazing eskates, but these are two which came to the top of my mind.  This is a cat I can skin in various ways.  I think we could sink batteries deeper into the deck by using the CNC, and adding a layer of carbon or fiberglass onto the bottom of the board with a vacuum bag, but for now, I'm assuming the first few we do will be wood only, and thus they have minimal bottom flycuts, both about 3 16ths of an inch deep, which turns out to make for a nice flat section on the bottom of the board for battery cases.  You might ask why i don't want to just use a concave that has 5-6" of flat in the middle, and the answer to that is because boards like that are not to my liking.  I think these boards must be better at performing during scary moments, swerving hard, ect, because that's when your life is on the line.  These molds have been designed first for DH and freeriding.  They'll work great even with another .25" or more of riser and large wheels.  

One thing to mention with both of these molds is that w concave can be added anywhere inside the middle 24" or so inches of the platform in any height and width (up to about 4-5" wide).  Our molding process allows for this.  We use one sided molds (female only) and have 6 of these presses.  We do have 2 hydro m/f presses, we use on boards when needed, but both of these molds are very amicable to pressing without the male side. 

Another point to mention is that we can use any shape with either of these files, and to a degree, wheel base can be adjusted.  Below are pics of each mold surface in CAD.  If you want a full top mount, cut out shape, ect.  All can be done.  The sky is the limit, but the main point is that the ground work has been laid. 

Well, here are the two.  This first one is a board we've been making for about 7 years called the Droptop.  It started out as a longer deck, and we've brought it down to something like 37".  The mold has changed over time. The owner of Pantheon boards and I had a discussion about this drop style which I give him credit for making.  I am a gentleman and I said I'd never do this drop style in any wheel bases that he offers.  Right now we have an agreement that I'll do stuff over 31" and he'll do stuff from what ever his ember is, up to 31".  Cheers to him.  The wheel base is 31" and the riding platform is over 26" depending on how much of your foot ends up in/on the drop. 

.625" drop
Between .5 and .625" concave depending on width of the deck.
baby kicktails if you want to make the board wider.
![drop%20top%20mold%20srf|690x374](upload://cqDUUjuGKhDXSkhXo2X5BzrE5p2.png) 
Here's a shape with slot through truck mounting config.
![droptop%20eboard|690x374](upload://o9fUB4cFWgBRoBvGjXsmmYgIuyw.png) 
The battery area as pictured here is 6" x 26". 

The next mold I want to show you is one I cut last week.  It is a 5th or 6th iteration of a board we made back in 2012 called the doobie.  This mold can have any wheel base from 30" down to 26" with the use of flush mounting.  Mild rocker, elliptical concave, and microdrops, roughly 24-25" effective foot platform. This mold has sizable kicks, and I encourage it.  I don't know how many of you have ever ridden manuals on your eskates, but I'd guess it is very few given what I've seen out there board wise....  On the right size kick, this experience is a must for me both for acceleration and braking.  This kicktail is 7" long at the outer WB, and 7.5 at the inner.  I imagine it will feel great with huge wheels and risers.   

![2019%20doobie%20mold%20srf|690x374](upload://1iO70IGS71iVM0DxiCrnpVwMIqO.png) 
![doobie%20eboard|690x375](upload://ie7PlhLWfM29rHIhKXDHEFGjAun.png) 
The battery area as pictured here ranges from 6.8" wide to 5.5" wide and is 25" long.  

The eskate I am going to build for myself will likely have the above deck.  I'm going with very low angle rear baseplate and something at or above 50 for the front. Have you ever manualled a board with 20 degree rear plates?  When you're at full tilt, the truck in rear is at about a zero ¬∞ angle, and it is SO easy to control at speed.  

Come at me bro.

Gonna talk about single units for now, as reselling is a whole different ball of wax, but it is possible, specially if we're doing a bunch at once. So if someone were to buy say 5 or 10 boards, we'd be talking about a sliding scale price matrix.  Discounts for shops are available, and we can even talk about doing more if anyone out there has demand for such. Prices can be really low for these, but as a 'factory' we've always struggled living off of and resupplying the shop with OEM business only.  

Per deck clearcoated, bare, with maybe an engraved Drang logo somewhere, (Doobie mold) in 9 ply configuration would be about $150 gripped n shipped inside the USA with flush mounts, wheel wells, and battery cut.  We can talk about custom battery enclosure dimensions.  That would be the price for basically any shape in this mold with those routes.  Smaller decks will fetch a lower price.  This doobie is 42" as pictured. 

The Droptop is a deck usually done with no wheel wells, or flush mounts, so that price would be $140 gripped n shipped (domestic price only).  

Different ply counts and materials used change the price.  We can use carbon fiber, fiberglass, or specialty veneer, of which we have a grundle. 

Overseas shipping can be as low as 50 and as high as 120 if you want DHL to bring it to you in under 4 days world wide. Usually 1-2 days to canada, and some other countries. 

Any out of the box ideas?

I'd love to learn more about this, how can you apply enough pressure top side if you don't have a male mold?

And how can you add "W" concave, the female mold needs to be modified to achieve this?

Yep. Skunk we can do that.  Any shape is doable, w or no w concave, laminate after routing which would be really nice on the eyes, and we could keep the plies down to maybe 7 wood plies only.  

Just made a quick video on how we add w concave to a mold and still get stellar laminates.

Awesome just figured out how to quote posts.  Might be better this way.  Yeah, cost reduction for sure, size and weight reduction, and it turns out having a soft male side of the mold allows for better laminates because wood isn't always the same thickness through each ply, and asking it to become uniform in thickness causes issues on decks I guess.  Come to find out Powell Peralta uses a similar set up, (much cooler and more specialized.)  Our strength is that we can do any concave any time.  Wait till you see our modular mold system, it can do almost anything.  Not all bends like this method, but most do.

That stands for wheel base. It really means the distance between the inner truck mounts. It doesn't represent the Wheel base, as different trucks will give a different true wheel base.

K cool, next step of the journey, thank you.  If anyone has a low angle baseplate made up that would be cool. 
 I might just makeshift one I guess I need axle height, but risers can be whatever.  CAD file that would be cool.  I might know a dude. BRB (tomorrow).  If Drang puts an E board out "quote unquote" then it will be this one first haha.  I am doing another one with a DIY kit, as a pure experiment.  

Offroad wheels on a 18"WB sized skateboard mold with full double kicks.  

I really need to get my funing running again too.  The leads on the charger while it was plugged in, and touched then it immediatly stopped working.

Fuck I wake up and there is so many new things here.  Seeing some sick looking decks,  Ive never been a fan of the slide through mounts prefer the drop through but to each there own.  And we found out @Skunk is a noob in disguise for not know what WB is... LOL sorry dude.  I feel like a slide through with a drop down deck would really only be able to have motors mounted out the rear depending on mount length and how deep the drop is cause if it is a flexy deck could tap the motors while spinning I may be wrong just what I'm thinking. Maybe just the drop/slide through.  Unless  motor mounts/ motor fit in a wheel well.

Also what about an extra layer of wood instead of putting carbon fiber or fiberglass over the bottom let that beautiful wood grain show you cant hid is away. On the plus side @drangboards you wouldnt have to worry about a graphic on the bottom as the bottom would be covered by a enclosure with the battery compartment set on the bottom of deck.

@drangboards it‚Äôs great to see yet another innovative company on here! After I finish my first esk8 build using a traditional longboard, I want to build another more nimble esk8 with a smaller kick tail deck. You have some big competition with jet boards and the Haya deck, but I would pay good money if you offered a 35-36‚Äù kick tail deck that had a built in enclosure and was made out of a combo of wood and carbon fiber.

Can do my man.  I think the grail for this approach is to laminate composite fibers on the top, then route the bottom, and then vacuum bag composite down onto the bottom to keep strength as high as possible. That will be just a bit down the road as I still need to buy vacuum bagging materials, and put together a frame I have for two sided vacuum bag.

If you used enough composite on the lower layers, it may offer enough strength in the 3 channels here:
![20181121_013353%20(copy)|345x173](upload://6hALCHDwFQkFuXLm40v1XEPdatw.jpeg) 

So maybe like 14 layers {top to bottom}: carbon, maple, carbon, carbon, maple, maple, maple, maple, maple, maple, maple, maple, maple, maple, maple, carbon, carbon, maple, carbon, carbon, carbon, maple

That would probably be just as strong as vacuum-forming composite on the bottom, but be ***much*** cheaper to produce.  As long as you focused a lot of composite into the lower part (closer to the ground) of the deck that isn't cut away.

Adding CF on the top does like ten times less structurally than adding it on the bottom.  The top layer is under compression and the bottom layer is under tension -- carbon fiber is only strong against tension.

I just think that adding a lot of it in the lower layers, even ones that will be partially cut away, will strengthen it greatly and reduce the need for vacuum-forming the bottom which will add so much cost.

I think concentrating the composite in the upper layers is a mistake that can be avoided :slight_smile:  It should be mostly in the lower layers, with some in the top

It is very similar to the deck we built you adam, a bit longer, a bit more concave, which I'm beginning to wonder about, and a bit of rocker, with a lower angle kick which has a longer transition arc.  

I think adding the bottom carbon, and then routing after that would still be a fine idea, and the production time would be reduced by about 30 minutes tops.  But I repeat.  One layer of carbon whether on the bottom or the top isn't going to do nearly as much as it would no both top and bottom.  What carbon on the top of a deck does which is something not many eskaters have talked about is torsion.  Less torsion equals fewer lives lost.  

Side note everyone, specifically Raptor 2 owners.  There may be something in the works.  His molds work great with our molds, and we are planning on building a raptor deck some time between now and after the new year.  I want to do all of these projects, so I'm not shutting the lights on any of the others, including the Nelson Longboards resurrection, and any other DIY board.  

I am still endeavoring to get you guys a shop tour, and also a post with images of all the mold files we have CNC fixtures for, which can be eskate modded easily.  

Stay tuned in and wait for the drop.  Feel free to post here any questions about your project.  I tend to prefer posts here to DMs in many cases.

My only concern to adding carbon top and bottom is vibration...I had a Raptor 1 (all carbon) and while it was a fun board in many ways, it vibrated like crazy. Not a big deal if you‚Äôre running a cutout deck with pneumatic wheels or 97mm+ abec wheels, but on top mount kicktail decks which generally run 90mm or smaller wheels the wood decks dampen vibration way better. 

Also, carbon layers top and bottom with carbon enclosures could create signal issue for the remote.

This is a good point.  One more reason for all the carbon to be in the bottom layers so it gets removed where the holes are routed

Flex is nice. Here‚Äôs a really nice flex board I‚Äôd love to make too. I kinda want to mod my boosted v2 eventually with this deck because everything would interface the same and with the low top speed a bit of flex will be great. 
 With even mild wheel wells this deck would have no wheel bite. This shape will have much more torsional rigidity since the shape is over 10‚Äù wide in the middle. 

https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/uploads/db1493/original/3X/6/5/655f400812d9b7f140dd0d72843c6cce8c040512.png

Skunk those are one of the other downhill freeride boards with a kick called the dendron by Chris Anders.  This would probably go perfect on the enertion raptor 2 system. It has an identical wheel base. I‚Äôd want to bring the wheelbhase in but it can‚Äôt be on that design. So I‚Äôll render that maybe tomorrow.

For split enclosures flex is somewhat ok depending on how you do the cables going from the battery to the vesc. I have heard that long battery lead to the vesc can cause drop outs. But if you shortened the board to a 20‚Äù Or less that could be nice

I‚Äôll be the canary in the coal mine on this one. Gonna make myself a board but I‚Äôm not entirely sure when I‚Äôll be able to personally afford the set up. Maybe I‚Äôll just start by machining a deck and making the build around it. I really want the batteries to be oriented long ways on the board all parallel with the mild rocker. This way the board can be very thin. I think the first board will not be like this though. If I‚Äôm routing a flat section on the bottom instead of a huge channel then the batteries can be sideways. 

I‚Äôd much rather find a dude who can set up the batteries and all electronics. Maybe I can offer that person a free deck in exchange for that. The case is another part I‚Äôd rather not build. I can supply the carbon fiber and resin but I just don‚Äôt have time to be the one who does it. Have been talking to adam0311 about doing this and we have plans to do it for the dasher he has ordered with us which just got pressed. I‚Äôll be making cuts very soon on the first dasher.

Another brand we build for is F.S.Boards.  They make awesome boards which would be very good for eboards as well.  Particularly the Montauk Monster.

I want to empower the DIY guys too, allthough it would be sad to cover up his graphics.

This next one is a DH board we make for James Webster, he really loves it, and I think it would make a great e board too.  ![27266950_10211434518921051_92750534_o|690x354](upload://aEbsSF9mIA5ke85lfFGN1cxUt1c.jpeg)

I'd LOVE making a slalom board with motors dude!!!!!!  Rear trucks being at near zero would probably make for a nice thrust.  Ton's of risers are common place on slalom boards, so good ride height could clear some big motors and wheels. Or maybe it has hub drive wheels.

I'm happy to consult with you.  Also keep in mind, that online tool is for custom one off builds which do not have CNC fixtures created for.  The molds and boards I've been picturing here are all mold and most fixture supported, so that means we can hold the board down to the CNC table in order to cut it the deck, wheel wells, flush mounds holes, battery accommodations, and the profile of the deck.  We are not really set up for doing hand shaped decks with battery routes.

Been talking to Onloop about the raptor.  

I think it would work on this model, and W concave would help save a bit of strength on this doobie mold.  Tried seeing how close I can get the battery to line up the truck mounts.  The raptor design would be great to make a board for with less or no drop in the mold.  

Here you can see it with the Battery tray on the board.  
![image|690x380](upload://sMwtq3YEUyMIw8VZL1Gindu89Eb.jpeg) 
An here without.  
![image|690x377](upload://fxn8jvHERQXLGbSsn99EsXBKw7q.jpeg) 
This model doesn't show any w concave, because I don't model that in CAD together with the board, but it would give us back some wood for support.  This deck would need to be 12 plies thick.  Roughly .75" thick or 19mm.  We'll see how that does, probably at least on 1 set up.  There might be some other molds which would work just as well or better than this one.  

There is about 3/16" between the top of the raptor riser, and the mounting base for the deck, so between the .31" raptor riser, this would have 1/2 inch of 12.7mm of total truck rise.  I guess 90 or 100mm wheels would be chill on this setup.  I am thinking of maybe making the deck with a longer tail, maybe 8".  

![image|690x375](upload://7Mqi4tU3Qgcjft8bAxhD0isgSC1.jpeg) 

I think I'll carve only the areas that need to be carved on the Raptor.  

I'm excited about the possibilities we have to make decks which can work for retrofitting onto other kits.  I can't wait to do a boosted mod deck, as well as this one for the Enertion Raptor 2 set up.  

I also want to make a set up that will be able to have a custom longitudinally aligned batteries which are buried deep into the deck along the concave.  

I am completely obsessed right now.  Sad to say but I have to do more actual work.

So here's a sketch.  This would be my ideal concave and deck configuration.  This is a set up which is 15 batteries across.  Batteries take up about 2.5" length, so in order to get 75 batteries, it would need to be about 15" long + or -.  I imagine we could get more batteries in there though.  The strips can be made to accept a bit of flex too, and maybe with composites, we can cut the deck thickness down a ply.

The only problem with that is you're creating the need for a specialty battery.
Flat packs are pretty standard and can be bought from a multitude of battery builders and suppliers.
With this setup someone will have to order a drangboards configuration battery custom.

[/quote]

Carbon fiber is not signal friendly for remotes. At all. The only reason that the Evolve Carbons or the Gen 1 Enertion Raptors work at all was because they used fiberglass lids, and Enertion discovered that a bit late in the game and had to issue new lids to mitigate drop outs. Fiberglass is radio transparent, so the signal was essentially unobstructed. 

Don't put carbon fiber between the receiver and the remote. The signal may be obstructed more than desirable. That means don't wrap your deck in it and then put the receiver on the bottom. If the receiver has a whip, route it up through the deck and under the grip, or something clever to mitigate the signal blocking effects of the carbon fiber.

When we started talking about carbon fiber decks I had thought about interference.  Then noticed @longhairedboy is on top of it.  Definitely something to really think about.  Carbon fiber looks cool but 1. takes away from the beautiful look of grain and can cause interference with the remote and receiver.  Fiberglass would be better cause you still can see the grain and doesn't cause interference.  If someone wants the carbon fiber look just make it a faux carbon graphic.  That would give the person the look they want without the problems

I prefer a footstop on a flat nose.  And yeah, front trucks as far forward as possible.  And the tail needs to be 6.5" to 8.5", no shorter.  Short tails are annoying, especially on a 15lb or 25lb board.

Theres another good option if you need a kick tail on a deck which have none. There are corc wedges out there used for yoga. They are pretty cheap and easy to prepare to fulfill your needs. I found them today and i will try it on my baffle 37 after the foam i used as a tail was not lasting for very long.![Kork-Yoga-Keil-lang-YOGA-STILVOLL-e1487256114210|500x500](upload://5Q4cltu06jUtEqM7sJihkLP6zEG.jpeg)

Do you UK dudes want to get Psychotiller enclosures, or do you want to put me in touch with the person who can make em out there.

No.  There are pictures posted of other decks which have been cut out of this mold, but none yet have been built to be eskates.  There will be 1 at least this week.  Gonna just keep it going after that.  I'm looking to build a replacement deck for my Boosted set up, probably after my warranty runs out...  Then we're going to do some enertion decks.  We're working on a group buy of this 42" deck with the EU folks.  Adam0311 is also first on the list....  The monster truck deck is another one this week.  And plenty of DIY kits.  The thing is, this planning phase is the part of the process that takes most of the time up.  After that, it's just draw a few lines, program cuts, and make it real.  

I still need to get my vacuum bag running, and I'll be able to do some full composite wraps.  Stoked on all of it.

Besides it being a little long too.... lol. But kicktail 110% a must.

Well we can seal the top with a flexible plastic sheet(think polycarbonate) and a flat rubber gasket. Screws at the right places will maintain that pressure, ensuring a tight seal. 

Pretty difficult to do that with a bottom mount enclosure. Also avoids enclosure damage from impact from rocks etc.

Water always finds a way in.  If it can't get in now, *wait a month* and it will find a way in.  Having the door on the bottom means that, due to gravity, which is irreversible, the water will tend to want to escape the enclosure through the failing seal, instead of fill it up.

If waterproof is your goal, having a door on top will not get you there.

The electric surfboard has to float, so, I'd say probably not.  But you already know that.  You're trying to smear me because you sell top-lidded decks.  Gravity does not care about looks.  Vibrations don't care about looks.  People outside of Southern California care about rain.  Surfboards don't take the vibrations that skateboards do.

Y'all can listen to the person with nothing to lose either way, or listen to the guy that *sells* decks with top lids saying that top lids are better.  Your choice

Easy with the thin skin buddy, nobody is smearing you.

Water pressure is greater under the board than on top, pure and simple. Riding through puddles or wet roads will drive water into a bottom mounted enclosure much more than the rain falling on top. Needless to say, very few people ride in the rain but many people ride on wet surfaces.

  I would wager that you need to build a few more boards before you go around crying out the _only_ way people should be building boards.

I imagine you should try using electric skateboards as your *only* transportation and sell your car, before you start saying I don't know what I'm talking about.  I rode to work today in the snow, over salted roads.  You?  I have two boards right now I can ride *in the ocean* if I wanted to.  How about you?  I guarantee that's no accident and it took a LOT of trail and error and broken stuff to get to that point.  I'm trying to add to the conversation with things that help -- you're trying to protect a good, but not *as* good, idea *because you financially benefit from pretending to not understand*.

You're only talking about preventing ingress.  I'm saying sure, preventing ingress is GREAT -- but if you really want your stuff to work as a commute tool outside of SoCal, it also has to deal with ingress if it occurs -- and for this aspect, a door on top is no good.  Assuming the seal has failed, it needs to be failed *on the bottom* so that water runs out the broken seal instead of filling up your enclosure.

Well, 
1. I don't feel confident of getting a good seal with the motor wires going into the enclosure at the bottom. 
2. Servicing is also easier with integrated deck, it's like lifting the hood of a car and working on the engine as opposed to flipping the board upside down, cleaning the mess on the enclosure and opening the bolts...
3. Sand dirt, salt water(when they salt the roads) doesn't get inside 
4. Damage is limited if you hit something or a rock flies onto the belly
5. looks cleaner

I think that may be a good idea of a thread about planning out some different boards cause it seems like this thread has gone out of what you had intended it to be which is no fault of yours.  As you will come to find there are very different personalities and thought processes from members on here.  You will learn who has the best intentions as you get to learn the people here.  Most of us are good people who want to see new and exciting things come from companies that have been in the skate world for a while but are new to the eskate world.


I will say @chaka is a good guys as he is with ollinboards.

The only one i agree with is 2. 
All the others are subjective. 
1) plenty of ways to solve. 
3) same as one
4) no matter what's on the bottom ot wil get damaged.  A strong enough encloser hold up and can be replaced cheap. 
5) option. 

Im not against top lid at all. But it's not what i want on a mid size kicktail deck.

I don't mind thread runaway to a degree, but I ask you since I am the noob here, for you to make it substantial.  In order words, post pictures to make real arguments.  I think there is room for a full enclosure deck but most decks don't need to be as thick as they get.  

Here are the threads we're gonna have to start.

Hummie compatible decks/enclosures
Raptor 2 compatible decks/enclosures
Adam0311 compatible decks, there is already a thread for this, but we might do a new one?  
I do want to make one of my own design, with the batteries being placed in the concave, lengthwise and with custom battery assembly.

That list can be updated as we go.

I'm all for coming to see the shop.  I am also all for working with other people, and I love the input of someone who has real world experience building.  

That being said input from every rider is valuable.  So let's just keep talking.  I'll post more as we go, but I also have another job that keeps me busy.  For now, I realized last night I have another deck that would make for a really nice compact deck.  

This one was done by Jeff V. of Pantheon longboards, and myself for a 3rd party, and our own use.  It is a mellow downhill concave, with drops, and flat profile when cut out with certain shapes.  This mold would make a REALLY good eboard too, with a shorter platform. 

Mellow rocker, microdrop (for a total of about 7/16" of an inch.  (11mm)

This board has a 28" WB, which would be less, and it has kicks longer than what are cut here.
![image|690x363](upload://3o1FODiIjmwZfRJaeiU3adyDR4I.jpeg) 

With a kicktail you can only get about 6.5" length, but on a shorter eskate, with less riser and smaller wheels this would be very desirable.

It looks like the Hummie battery enclosure might cramp the 26" WB a bit...  The wheel wells would interrupt the corners of the enclosure.  IF we moved the wheel base outward 1" on both front and rear it would fit better.  GOSH I need to get back to work.  Help me make this my full time job guys haha, I love doing it!  

![image|690x382](upload://tsrDLCYU5zweh0jm1Of8zGLyXqk.jpeg) 
I made this enclosure 585mm by 145mm by 12.7" deep.  I think it would work with a thick board...  Looking at 12 plies.  This channel is just a bit curved, as it follows the rocker, and the concave.  I think Moon has told me they need to be flat.  Can't some of these battery packs bend a bit?

Here is another mold I'd love to make an eskate with.  This mold IMHO would make a perfect skate deck stretched.  The wheel base would be great somewhere between 25" and 27.25". The concave is mild. and the platform is without rocker or drops.  Tails could be 8" with a 25 or 26" WB.  I honestly like flat boards more than anything else, (they need concave though).

So since 585mm doesn't work for this board, I shortened it by 2" or 50.8mm.  This makes the battery opening 145x534.2mm and a peak depth of 12.7mm.  This is the deck for the EU group buy.  39" long, with newschool truck mounting, 10" wide, 8" tail, rocker, Moderate DH concave, (I suggest we use a w concave to keep some more structure, and give some good traction for the feet.  

![image|690x375](upload://zvPSum1V2NpfZ38Lc0EV5qapcHa.jpeg)  

This battery openning goes as deep as 9 plies, so I know we can't go quite that deep on this mold, but we can figure it out from here.

145mm is pretty tight.  Can you get a couple more mm on that?  It's not too narrow, but by the time you put two cells with insulation everywhere and try to run a 10AWG wire next to it, even like 2mm more would be awesome ;-)

We can do a wider one yeah.  I'll do that work once we're a bit closer.  I just noticed I had the enclosure route going deeper than the target of 12mm.  I wouldn't have believed that to be strong enough, but now with this edit, it is definitely deep enough.  if we add w concave we'll be able to take it from 4 plies deep in the center up to almost 8 plies going down the middle. I think this is going to be an awesome deck. 

We can certainly make it wider.  Don't hold your breath on that edit, I'd rather we just continue as though the battery opening of this one is wider.  We can dial it as we go.  Modeling takes more time than programming it for cuts.

The deeper the better seeing the cutout goes almost right to the rear truck.
This means forward mount motors will be above the enclosure possibly. So the lower profile the better.

Skunk here's why I'm saying you wouldn't want a taller kick.  When the deck is leaned back (this model is with 100mm wheels, and healthy riser), the angle of contact is 31¬∞.  For a deck like this where we're not trying to get off the ground, we want about 25¬∞.  raising the kick angle isn't a good idea.  Promise. 

I had already planned for using a tail protector too.

My concern is with the motors having clearance if you intend them to go under the enclosed and get a good angle on the trucks for turning you going to need a big riser. I‚Äôm guessing 3/4 of a inch min to keep the motors off the ground. I‚Äôm not exsperianced enough to work this out on paper or moc it up in auto cad. Can some one better than me draw it up to show Drang what my consent is/ work out how high the risers will have to be?

Edit: unless the intention is hub motors then this will not be a issue.

I'd say that with this deck the angle of the motors might be just a bit less than with say boosted, which is my only point of reference, but it should fit with under .5 riser.  Not sure about ideal wheel diameter yet, maybe 100 is a bit big, but we'll figure that out.  One of my next plans is to get the CAD models for the various components, and see just how well it will fit.  The motors will be near the battery cover in this drawing, so that might be out other pinch point.

I imagine the angle can be lowered on some set ups.  Gotta find CAD models for what we need to know, and we'll know before making the first one.  .75" riser shouldn't be needed.  If the angle of the motor can be tuned, we should be good, it just won't have as good of an approach angle.

Yep, we just gotta solve for what clearance will be with those.  What the common angles are, motor sizes ect, and go from there. The first deck I proposed in this thread had a longer wheel base by 2" so that additional inch was meant to give a bit more clearance than this one being at 26" wheel base.

Looks like we have plenty of room and won't be needing any sort of motor wells.  I think if 100mm wheels are going to be used then the riser should be almost .5" for wheel bite purposes.  I think I'll be rocking 85mm wheels, with .25" riser or more.  

It looks like the motor needs to be about .25" above the axle plane rather than .5".  The following image shows the contact point of the motor on the enclosure.  This is at 20¬∞ of lean with .3 risers.  If I move the motor to .25" above the axle plane, the motor will clear as long as the enclosure doesn't rise up above the original surface until it clears.

I downloaded a 6384 motor, it looks like we can get clearance with the motor being 2.5" from the axle, and .25" above the axle off the road.

Ok I just wanted to see roughly what size trucks would be needed for the 6384s.  It seems with the right wheels, 6384s would work with 230mm trucks...  

Is this enough information in order to figure out if we're on the right track?  Or is it back to the drawing board?  

For those non adjustable motor mounts, what is the most popular mounting location for the motor? 

![image|690x364](upload://sEARrjhSXmRZnA8nXpodddxsIAu.jpeg)

![image|690x258](upload://98H3Dr1TK7A1yvZUuFSLLD1vCrX.png) 

20 degrees of lean is quite a bit, and with 100mm wheels, that would not be quite attainable due to wheel bite.

To clarify, the kick tail would work best as it is, if it was being ollied.  Most skate decks have exactly a 36¬∞ pop angle, but if the board has double the wheel base, that angle doesn't want to be the same.  it will ollie better with less aggressive kicks.

I don't think much of anyone is doing ollie's with esk8 boards. Only point in a kicktail on esk8 for me is 
1) locking in my rear foot
2) lifting the front just a bit when hitting somthing with a big lip
3)helping to pick up the board without completely bending over.

@drangboards so i just dropped a deposit on a steel press frame to replace my broken wooden one and have decided to keep pressing my own decks. Eventually i'll add all kinds of fancy pneumatic/hydraulics and buttons to it but for now i'm sticking with bottle jacks. 

however, this coming year i will be looking to design/have designed new molds for new decks. Would you be interested in making molds for people that already have presses? 

Basically the problem here is that @treenutter is becoming a threat to me and now that he's making so many awesome decks i have to respond in some way to maintain my masculinity. I tried just getting him to move down to Florida by making it really cold and dry where he lives with my weather controlling powers but he refuses to move to where the humidity is perfect for veneer all year round. So now that i won't be able to just invite him over and eat him to absorb his powers, i have to make more decks.

It's your project, and your shop! Do it your way, because clearly you know what you are doing(more than most here) and are doing a great job.  9/10 of the people here complaining have never pressed their own deck, or even produced something themselves before.

We can do this.  The materials to make molds will depend on the solidity of your press.  We use MDF for molds, because our presses are inherently stiff.  Other materials I'd have to figure out with you.

Agreed.  Pretty soon I'm going to start a thread for that specific deck.  Likely we'll be doing other group buys for other decks too.  If anyone wants a custom, with it's own needs, we want to do that too.  All I do all day is custom CNC cuts.

Hey @drangboards, If I were to design a new deck in CAD, would you be able to make it(it will be a very few pieces)? Or do I have to design around the moulds that you already have?  If latter, then how do we go about it?

IF it was designed in CAD, we would need to make a male/female, or a female only mold depending on the bending requirements, and then we'd have to make a fixture to hold it down on the CNC for cutting. 
Mold cost can be as low as $200.  

Fixture cost can be as low as $200 

Tell me what the mold would look like.  There is a chance we already have something that can work for your needs.

Jared, what‚Äôs the kick angle on the boards you made me? It‚Äôs absolutely perfect imo for a 37‚Äù deck. That deck also handles 85mm wheels on loose 50 degree caliber trucks with .5 inch raiser, no problem. On tighter trucks I ran .25 inch raiser without wheelbite. 90mm wheel would almost certainly require .5 inch raiser.

Guys, I've been pondering deeply what I want to ride first.  I love the microdrop doobie mold, but to be honest, I'm not keen on making a 12 ply board for myself.  I realized what I really want is to have a huge skateboard.  I want a nose to be able to tick tack over stuff like train tracks, and to be able to let the balls hang with the wide stance riding.  This board is what I am pondering for my hopeful Raptor 2 setup.  

Before I go any further, please don't think I am putting another idea down in order to raise this one.  I am not doing that.  I am making another board which will be awesome AF, on top of the other designs I'm also doing.  

This deck for me would be the perfect raptor deck.  I am not sure if it will be able to be mounted onto the bottom of the deck, due to the concave.  but I might actually glue wood onto the bottom and then route it flat. Or just use some choice washers or something in order to keep the battery mount nice n flat.  I don't like the idea of cutting through the main structure of the board.  (I'll do it but I'd rather do it this way).

![image|690x375](upload://57JCsCOAO2hFg7Qi6xgeu40RmOh.png) 

This deck will be roughly as thick as a 9 ply deck, but it's going to have fiberglass on top and bottom along with a bamboo/maple hybrid layup, which will create a VERY stiff configuration.

For those interested in the Adam0311 38 Dasher the price is 145$ plus shipping with no bulk discounts of more than 10 bucks. 
Specs:
 
Just shy of .5‚Äù (12.7 mm) Drops begin coming down at 23.5 on center on the deck with a nice flow you can stand all over.  The kicks are 6.5 long at 18 deg.
W concave in the platform about 19 long which will help strengthen the deck because the middle ridgeline will not be cut.   
Max width 9.9‚Äù with a mildly rounded top rail which can be made more round for those who won‚Äôt want as steep of concave. 
Concave- 2‚Äù flat bottom elliptical medium height. (3 out of 5.) about .5 give and take due to the directional shape. 
8 ply in this case. (Any layup available) 
Enclosure-flat route through 1.5 to 2.5 plies (can do whatever here for other customers too) 

I plan to have it cut tomorrow. Might machine a fixture for doing this but I don‚Äôt feel like vertical fixturing the pieces I‚Äôd need to do it by machine so it will be by fiixtured by hand some how and cut on tue cnc with a big 2.5‚Äù flat end mill in small passes stain and clear coat.

Besides the enclosure the deck is hand built. Hand drilled hand cut hand cut wheel wells and as always hand glued for your long term driving habits and don‚Äôt worry about riding it in rain because even if you get through the clearcoat maple is just hard and our laminations are great.

Ok the battery enclosure is cut, but now I have a wild idea.  I want to lighten the deck as much as possible.  8 plies of wood with CF top and bottom and FG in the middle is going to be very stiff.  I want to cut some cool stuff into the board. Change my mind. 

I just accidentally sent this to a memeber who messaged me, and it's not letting me post "it" again...  I guess it's an anti spam. Maybe adding this text makes it go away.

I found the best way to fixture this down with a 2x3 and some screws.  About to go for it. We'll see how well this works.  I'm using a 2.5" end mill called a flycutter, and have 3 paths programmed at variable depths according to where I think it should be.

While all you were out partying I was having my own little party.  Got 3 boards prepped for batteries.  The two Adam boards were not as precise or repeatable as I wanted them to be, so I won't be doing more hand built boards with bottom routes for enclosures.  These two were the canaries, and the both died.  Well, they'll do great and we'll learn from them, but the process was not nearly as awesome as I wanted it to be.  Either way, here they are.  Adam0311, I'll get these prepped and ready.  The second board some how came out with more concave than the first...  That's why the routes are deeper.  We'll see how they turn out.  Warranty is real. 

I used the same depth of cut for both, and one came out way deeper (the one with more concave).

I'm sure they'll both live long lives, but if not, Adam, we got yer back.

Onto the next projects, double kick, and doobie mold.  We'll see how those work.  

That router bit doesn't like maple.  It burns no matter what speed and feed are used.  Next time I'll use the .375 cutting bit which has a nice up spiral end mill.  Oh well, sanders for the win.  Good night mo Fers.

@drangboards After brainstorming and thinking about it a bit more, I actually think a board with a recession for the battery (Hummie deck style) would be better than a board that has an entire enclosure built in. I think a board with a built in enclosure would sacrifice a lot of strength/cost/customizability.

It would have to steer into the lean.  Maybe 10 degrees of rake on that so as it turns the wheel base effectively gets smaller as the tires change steering angle. We might see a concept, he is pretty enthusiastic about a board with real world ride ability on chunder.

It has more if anything.  The mold was completely untouched since last time you ordered Adam.  It could be that the deck got more time in the press, or the humidity was significantly higher in the shop when it was pressed, so it may have a bit more concave, and drop than the first one.

The second deck some how got cut much deeper so the battery case will be wider and a bit longer.

I like that too, and I want to make it, because the current evo isn't long enough for my liking. 

I'd say if someone wants a board pressed, we're ready.  We have open presses, and can begin right away.  

Both group buys which are being started, will go down, but I do so much custom work, I can throw you in now.

Welp, made some progress on a few fronts.  A buddy wants help setting up a little crazy project using mountain board hardware, and he brought another set up, it's a 20 battery set up.  The monster truck board is going to have 28 batteries.  I have no idea who made any of this stuff, can anyone help me with this?  My buddy is going to tell me where he got it all, I'm sure on Amazon....  Aside from that, we pressed a 12 ply doobie mold which will be used in the 39" deck for the first group buy.  I don't want group buys to be perceived as the only way to get a setup through us.  It will cost more to do anything one off, but once I've amassed the designs, and machining techniques, might be able to lower that cost. We're still very affordable.  We are going to do a few group buys for skate decks meant to be powered however...  

Here is the battery for the mountain monster.

Gonna have to rise this one up more, and who knows, it might not work at all.  
The wheels might just hit until we rise it up 3"  Taking bets as to how many riser we'll end up riding it with...

This should be something I should be able to positively seal.  Even if it's a bit messy to take apart... 

Doobie mold 12 ply.  It feels very solid, and I'm stoked to remove a bunch of material off the bottom of the board.  I'd like a very battery heavy set up, like the goup buy will be.  I should have something machined inside of this next few days on that. (probably more like a week).  Check out these pictures of the doobie mold.  I am so stoked on this for electric skateboards, because it has a HUGE stance on it. Even with your feet between the wheels, it is still a nice wide stance inside the drops.  With one foot back behind the wheels on the kick, it has ton's of room, and will guaranteed transport it's riders into another dimension.  There isn't an inch on this platform you can't stand on.  Exactly what I wanted to design here.

This battery is paired to an identical motor and truck set up with the same size wheels.  I am unsure as to what we're going to put this set up on, but I'd love help getting through this.

Next move is to press the FIberglass Bamboo/maple hybrid layup I've been on about.  It will be as thick as a 10 ply deck or a bit thicker, but it will also be about as stiff as can be with that layup and size.  Without cutting into the bottom of the deck, in order to make molds for enclosures do CNC fixture for that purpose with all the appropriate geometry.  The vacuum bag is only days away from being real, which means post CNC composite laminations. 

We just acquired a seemingly nice vacuum pump.  Well, it's a fridge.  Not getting any information about it yet in searches, but it's medically certified whatever that might mean.  I bet this would have the kind of pump we can run in continuous mode without using any air like a venturi would do.  Nice and quiet operations.  Here are some pictures in case someone who's an expert in refrigeration is also into DIY Eskate.

```
Before routing a significant amount off of the rails top and bottom the weight is 5.8 lbs.  I'd rather put the board back down on the table and cut more out of the middle, because it feels stiff as nuts, and take more off the wheel wells, and also the tail pockets.  That all might bring it down to below 5.5 lbs, then after routing all the rails healthily, and adding back on plenty of clearcoat maybe the final weight will remain below that 5.5 or even 5.25 lbs or 2.38136 kg.

That is a good question!  Well as the tradition goes, it must start with the letter D.  Any suggestions on what to name it?  

The final specs are:

L39" (99cm)
W10" (25.4cm)
WB 26"-29" (66cm-73.66cm)
Tail 6.5"-8" (16.5cm-20.3cm)
Mild Rocker
W concave
Microdrops
Flush mounts
wheel wells 7.5 ply deep 

Here's a shot of the concave.

Here is a board I think would be cool to do replacement decks for the Boosted Mini X.  

I am trying to get this one built for a team rider to race Maryhill downhill this year, and another one of you.  I'd like to see this come to life.  It is a shape that will work only if composites are being used, or else the board will likely not want to make the bends without warping.  The wheel base as shown is 21ish inches, and the length overall is around 30.5 inches.

Slalom molded decks are going to hopefully become popular for eskate due to the forward riding stance.  Low angle trucks rear would rock on this one, but it would be even cooler to run two motors in the rear with a very narrow track width.  (Motor in front and behind)

Frenchy, yes.  I need to either recreate this mold once again, or make the totally new one.  This one would be more stable feeling, as it actually has little W concave beezies going on for your front heel and rear toe.  If you want to buy the deck and have a cut made on it, then I'd say let's find 10 more people who want the same deck and the price might be somewhere between 120 and 150 for wood and more for composites.  I am getting the hang of making decks with over stiff cores and then removing material.  The 12 ply is very stiff, and we'll know about the 11 ply maybe this weekend.

Everyone has a different idea of what aggressive is This board has under a half inch.  It is going to be modified just a bit to be a bit lower angle, but other than that, the depth is great. You really do want to stay on the board under grip.

Been not posting for a while, busy at the other job, but I'm still very much here.  I want to build one of these for the slalom board.  TKP rear trucks, probably mounted at about zero degrees, and under a kick tail (wedged rear platform).  Really would win every race on this sort of set up for a few main reasons, more grip being the main reason.

Yes, and you can even do front RKPs on a high angle, some people ride 65¬∞ plus.  Riding a board with a low rear angle is an experience I'd guess at this point .1% of esk8 riders have.  I have it and it is absolutely the only way I'll ever ride fast again.  Even cars with rear steering don't use more than 10% steering of the front.

I don't like TKP trucks above about 22" wheel base, they get very swervy at the limit, and grip is very low but it is still very fun.  You'll need to tighten the rear bushing when you go lower on the angle.  Might think about going with an RKP truck in the front with adjust ability also.

I've hit 38 miles per hour so far on this setup but it's definitely more of a Carver and if you don't know what you're doing at those speeds it's a little crazy.
But yes I do want them on one of my shorter decks.
Just took the rear base plate off it's only slightly Dwedge compared to the front.

I'm rocking 23¬∞-47¬∞ with a 27" WB RKP both so it may be a bit different for your trucks, but the thing you want to do to get the feeling I am so stoked about is to lower the rear a bunch, and raise the front to get your steering back. (AS NEEDED)

So the adjustable baseplate at an extreme angle will need custom mounts unless both motors are forward facing. Motor doesn't clear this part of baseplate.

But its a no go on this deck with these motors. 
Took them off and put my rkp back on.

me too!  This deck in particular I think is nice, because if I hold a manual out at around 20 degrees, the rear truck is at about zero, so manualling at speed is more about courage over skills.

Hard to say. 
Last time I had it on reverse Kingpin the board was topping out at 31.

I did some changes in my gearing and motors but then had to take the RKP off for maintenance and put the tkp on.

My top speed is now 38 but the rkp just went back on today so ive only done that on tkp.

I wanna brake 45 and I feel like that's when I'll start to really notice how these split angles are working.

More changes to be made.  Lol always

Well it's time to come back into this realm.  Another build has begun.  This one is paid for, so we're moving forward, and the due date is under 4 weeks from now on the first 3 protos.  We're doing three flex tests.  The exact concave is going to be decided at some point in the next week before we cut the first mold.  Here are the renders my good customer adstar, (on the eskate news page) did and some of my renders of how that mold would need to look.  

![mtnbrd%20render1|690x388](upload://kFpiBAzXpZYtoA5Kih2G6S6quQJ.png) 
![mtnbrdenclosure|690x353](upload://rOrebXgsgR1PvBVfVhLnGwhr347.png)

![mrnbrdbottom|690x353](upload://ik8w1dNMyANmsx5hF3RWptBWSBq.png) 

![image|690x380](upload://6fgkrCMv1okXaEl4UXXxOYBZH58.png) 
This is the first render Adstar did for me.  It doesn't contain the entire mold, and has some really optimistic bends, so we're working together to make the mold now.  

Experimenting with concaves right now, and talking about the difference between some of these options, keep in mind the size of the platform, and stance of the rider... 

![MTNBRD%20render%202|690x367](upload://uyLk66tOPuI0rs9hWxWpdgAfYtT.png) 
![image|690x376](upload://crMnj3uk6zVjpL3atCIW7NYq6CW.png)

![image|690x379](upload://pYX5WpH9Vhep8fI6NrLJ8I0R4xf.png) 
These are all pretty close to each other in geometry, but how it all bends is slightly different from one to another.

12S6P!!!!!! We'll be doing some sort of a group buy, so if you want a range monster mountain board, with nuanced concave, keep tabs.  

Here is the post where Adstar is finding more peeps to get in on the group buy in esk8news, https://forum./t/ramm-board-slr-anyone-interested-in-a-prototype/6528/29

I've got three boards that I can easily carry with one hand and do my grocery shopping with. 

I want a board to go on adventures with.
I don't plan on carrying it I plan on riding it.
And if i do it won't be a problem.  Almost every job I've ever had has had a 70lb repetitive lift requirement. It ain't be that heavy.

I"m most leaning towards this tab type although I'm told I'll need to make the truck mounts flat which will take a second model to be made.  We're been going between drop styles, into the tab, and I like all these options, and want to look at the possibility of doing it asymmetrically, like this, or doing something slightly different than this now.  

![image|690x380](upload://8oyphhsX23VamZCdElQ0nqWJBtD.png)  

We were tossing around the idea of doing with a lower rear angle, but I don't see the turning radius being good enough to REALLY want it. To get a more directional ride I think this concave would do well along with harder rear bushings to keep the board happy at speed.  How much speed?  I don't know, as I've not ever ridden a mountain board.  

I think moving available front foot space forward, and giving the back a harder ramp for rear heel toeing should give the board a bit of directional stability.  Sending it to Adstar for review and contemplation.

I would say definitely run a split.  I am running channel trucks with a 12 degree split and it is awesome so perhaps mid 30's front and low 20's rear.

Yep, this is being designed to be a long range cruiser board, nice and surfy, and as @Skunk mentioned suitable for day long adventures. With the 21700 12s6p Samsung 50e cells(my preference) this will perhaps do 100km+ on a single charge. 

And hello @drangboards, made it back to the forums I see.
