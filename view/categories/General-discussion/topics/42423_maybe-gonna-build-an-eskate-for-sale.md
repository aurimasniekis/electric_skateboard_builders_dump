I've got enough parts sitting around to build a pretty nice dual motor eskate with either eBay ESC or dual VESC, a 6s 8k mAh pack with flywheel clones on an Arbor Highground or Arbor Vugenhausen. With the eBay ESC I would sell for $500, with dual VESCs $600.

Is there in any interest?

If you build it, they will come.

That's cool, I like building as much as I like skating so this is win win for me.

It's sad seeing perfectly good parts not being used and enjoyed

Someone would definitely buy this if you build it. Same price as those cheap chinese boards and it'd be better in every way.
