I couldn't help searching for anything interesting on their site with your hints at intrigue.  Their bamboo-x construction looks strange like the boards are now made for way fewer laminates than typical and one thick black one in the middle.  Hummm

Yes. They're doing some interesting stuff there, and it looks like they did the decks for Evolve's bamboo series, which i've found have some interesting properties. 

Also i need some thane from you for your older hubs. I'll PM you.
