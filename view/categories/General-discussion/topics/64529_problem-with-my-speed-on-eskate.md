The vesc might be limiting your amps.
Check that.

Are you sure if it’s a brushed or brushless motor?
600w is not that much, 12v too.
Let us know a bit more about your setup.
Which controller you use, which kV your motor have, it’s single or dual motor, the 12v batteries in series or parallel, how is your gearing, which wheel size you drive?

600 watt is definatrly enough. The motors from meepo run on 500w I believe.
