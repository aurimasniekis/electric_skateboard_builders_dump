Okay so I know that the deck being lower to the ground makes it more stable at speed, and wedging/dewedging the trucks also makes it more stable. My understanding is that you can't wedge a dropped truck, so what route would provide more stability. I ask this as I'm slowly shopping around for a second deck to add to my repertoire

This may help.  Seems problematic though. 
Feel you with the whole aus thing bro.  ðŸ™„
Fyi though. My set up is double drop with 218 and is stable as all fuck.  Up to 55 kmh.  Bushings are a defo must though.  Good quality and the right duro.   Kind of a try and see thing.   What works for me might not work with your riding style.   When the set up is good you can ride out a wobble but if not then itâ€™s change you undies time.  Iâ€™m still struggling with a fast carving machine.  Seems to be one or the other atm.

I think you want the 35 in the back with 50 in the front.

I'm currently in the middle of transitioning my build from a DIYeboard kit to a full DIY build, and while I'm doing this I am slowly figuring out what bushings suit me

Yeah mate itâ€™s like that and no one can really help because it so very much depends on your style of riding.  ![image|666x500](upload://iC0OtfneDEWZ0iowlbDy3oA3LEW.jpeg
This thing is my toy build that started life as a Chinese prebuilt piece of turd.

Be putting up a reiteration build thread soon so all the pics will be there.  Basically all thatâ€™s left is the deck but the missus canâ€™t tell the difference ðŸ˜‚
