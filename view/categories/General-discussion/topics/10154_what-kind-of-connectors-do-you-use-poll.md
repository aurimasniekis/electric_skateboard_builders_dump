Hi!

I'm doing a poll to see what kind of connectors people are using most of the time for the e-board batteries. Shameless plug: I'm doing this in order to know what kind of connectors I should offer with my next product, an inexpensive high-power switch. But in addition to that, this would be useful information to others as well!

Cheers,

Vlad

You might include 5.5mm bullet which is very commonly used.
I don't think anyone uses 3.5mm bullets.
Some people are using XT90 connectors. You might include them as well.

I voted XT90. But I also use HXT8.0 cause I share batteries with my 10+ hp rc boat. Way overkill for these lower power boards. They work though.

Just an idea, you could just have options on your site (store) and have the top 3 connectors on their (xt90,xt60,5.5bullet etc), might take a little extra effort but is good service imo.
