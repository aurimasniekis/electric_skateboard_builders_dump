"best" and "most attractive" are not the same thing for me. I'd bolt right through if I didn't want to look at the screws.

Unfortunately I can't (or I don't want) to drill my thin carbon deck so I'm also with @rojitor on this one (like Secretariat in Belmont 73' for the Triple Crown and without a whip) ....  ®Velcro by 31 lenghts!
