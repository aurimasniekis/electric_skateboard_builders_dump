Could you please expand on what the purpose and/or what the general discussion of this post is..... and there are several motorized Mtb boards and riders in this forum that do very similar things.

Look man, I hate to be this guy... but as someone who spent weeks of reading before joining and months of planning before even posting... you seem to have put in ZERO effort to even understand what this forum is about or contains. You joined 1 hour ago and have 35min read time. Please spend more time reading and searching before making posts. As someone who had to sort thru all the pointless posts like this, its just frustrating... maybe im being harsh. But please help yourself and just read some.. This place have pretty much everything you need to know, but YOU have to put in the work to learn.. anywho, rant over. Best of luck, happy reading.

Cmon man, all he‚Äôs saying is that he wants to fly on a Mountain Board! Personally, I love this idea! Anyway, this video is the biggest I‚Äôve seen anyone go on an Electric Mountain Board. I‚Äôd like to start hitting some massive jumps, let‚Äôs get this on Nitro Circus. Happy riding!

I hear ya man, just keep in mind, a lot of people that are new to this are totally in awe of what most of us have learned to do. Some people don‚Äôt know where to start and in 10 years most of us who are here regularly and constantly are going to be gurus. I mean look at @longhairedboy,, @hummie, @sender, @mmaner and so many I didn‚Äôt list have never once told me to figure it out alone. This forum is for those that are in awe, inspired, or motivated by this amazing hobby/sport/way of life. Be kind my friend, always allow knowledge to flow. This guy joined because he sees something he wants to love! Let‚Äôs hype him up, not tear him down. NTM this is the general discussion thread, there‚Äôs plenty of other places he could‚Äôve posted this erroneously, like the build thread.

I was totally new and in awe and didnt know where to start.. so i read and searched. Not just here but everywhere on the internet. I wasnt saying he should do anything alone at all. Just use the knowledge thats already posted.. its here and he can make anything he wants happen...if hes willing to work for it. Sorry if my post seemed bashing,(not my intent) It just seems so many people want results with little work.. I lost my cool, and valid point it is gen topic. Sorry fellas so off topic and OP.  That said, Idk if flips with an EMTB is plausible, I mean all that extra weight makes it really hard to manipulate the board. Definitely could get good air time tho. Fly high!

This type of toxic behavior towards the new guys has become normalized around here and it needs to stop, best way to end it is with quick and firm recourse.

Nothing new to me, I moved around a lot as a kid and had to change schools often. My brother and I were always the biggest kids in our grades and raised to not look the other way when other kids were being bullied so we had a tendency to regulate on the bullies within the first week. The principals loved us!

@J95hicks please don't feel like I am building any grudge against you, if you ever met me in person I would probably buy you beer and have a laugh about the online antics.

@Jaeson found very good words @J95hicks understood his mistake and apologized. Thing is done and good. Your comment was unnecessary. You preach from being kind to new members, than be kind to regular members as well. Being a good example makes more sense than to speak up loud but being not a tick better with it...

Okay, im not gonna lie. Youre right about the new guy stigmatism and toxicity. I felt the same way when i joined. And so you moved around alot and where big. So was/am I. Went to 9 dif schools growing up... heck i got kicked out for being the big kid and not knowing my own size(private school thought i was too physical for my size) so that gives you the right to be the judge. Did the principal give you a metal too? I tried to keep it clean at least, and thats hard cuz im a sailor and I curse like one lol. Okay, now i got my jabs in we can call it even @Chaka lol. Like i said, no skin off my back, I got pretty thick skin. Cheers to that beer man

This is getting nowhere. We could be doing this all day and night and the only guys giving likes would be @mmaner and @dareno . 

I have to go to bed. Your mother said she wants me to rub her toes and you know how bitchy she becomes when she does not get her way.

@dareno is right. @rich is the Mikhail Baryshnikov of eMTB

this guy has set up a sick ramp/landing situation! Nitro Circus is most definitely more my speed...:star_struck::exploding_head:. I think it just requires the ideal environment. a course set up specifically for eMTB's would be almost the same as flowing trail bike courses but minus the advanced terrain. the idea of staying smooth and flowy, transitioning to some big air's, just requires the right lines... I intend on building a eMTB that has a small lightweight battery that is for supplemental power and electric brakes. I will thoroughly enjoy the walk back up hill. snap in a new battery, next race. I just got on this site through a friend (havent found him yet on here lol), I told him my idea and he said this is the mecca of DIY eboards. so here I am. not a whole lot of liquid funds to blast on toys for myself with 4 kids, at the moment, so I will start on this project.... uhhh... in the near future.

@mmaner I mean.... you asked. 

I gave the toon a fair shot, my oldest was watching it until I wised up. I have a 12 yr old daughter, a 3 yr old, a 1.5yr old, and a newborn... it really pertains to the eldest lol... unless of course I wanted to start filling my toddlers brains with nonsense. Graphics are done by a talented kindergartener. The context is done buy a group of adults... goes right on with family guy, Simpsons, etc... its to doop parents into thinking adult situations are for kids too! "they can handle it!"...."dont be so close minded."... im not saying its a good show or a bad show, not much of a witty toon guy anyways, im saying that its not up to TV to expose or not expose my kids to shit! I think that a little knowledge goes a LONG way before my kids watch anything. Straight up :

 * In the episode "What Is Life?" a brief scene shows the Ice King (a character that liked kidnapping princesses) reading what appears to be a nudie magazine on his bed. There are also heavy undertones of procreation in this episode, including claims that the Ice King's lightning bolts made him the "father" of a robot they revived.

* In "Burning Low", Jake explains to Finn the "15 Tiers" of a relationship where tier 1 is "hugging", tier 2 is "smooching", tier 5 is "looking at her fifteen-feet beautiful stomach" and tier 8 is "touching her horn for the first time" (however this was said thinking of Lady Rainicorn). Then Finn asks about tier 15 and Jake says "stay away from that!".

* In one episode, Finn and two other people are naked with logs covering their crotch. The log moves up and down as the characters walks or move. The original design had beavers instead of logs, but this was changed due to CN censorship.

* innuendoes!: Cake increasing in size and explicitly shaking his giant butt ("Bad Little Boy"), Finn putting spaghetti in PB's mouth ("To Cut a Woman's Hair"), Finn following a female getting into a shower ("Marceline's Closet") and some characters playing "games" in a bed ("Love Games"). Also, Hunson Abadeer's design looks like human genitalia, as the own crew recognised.

* Jake made a "special" video for his girlfriend Lady Rainicorn as seen in "The Pit". In one episode, she's pregnant, and in another episode we see their five children.

* Finn and Jake play to put the finger in things in the episode "Five More Short Graybles". Even BMO does a suggestive gesture while wanting to "stick their fingers into 'these holes'", refeering to the controllers.
* In the episode "Blood Under the Skin", Finn crosses the Swamp of Embarrassment, where there are a lot of curtains with a lot of people having a shower and with their parts covered (some offscreen). Finn is called a pervert and he repeats that he is not, and a man says "My most private parts seen by a boy!" and "my privates!", that are said twice in that episode. At the end he comes completely embarrassed with a red face.
* The episode "All the Little People" is full of suggestive content; this includes Finn investigating about how the little people interact with others. This episode was banned in CN Latin America.
* Lady Rainicorn and Jake is set-up for "seven minutes in heaven" by Finn. He places them inside a closet.
* In the episode "Breezy" there are a few innuendos which include the implication of LSP made it with Finn (she says things like "I know all about your dirty deeds" or "I didn't wait infinity for a dip in the kiddie pool! We're taking this to the deep end!") or Breezy calling herself "a virgin queen bee".
* Ricardio the Heart Man threatens to cut out Bubblegum's heart and make out with it. He is also an implied rapist.
* In some episodes looks like Jake enjoys with his feet being licked ("Another Way"). Even in an episode ("Freak City") he says to Finn that "he's too young to understand" that.
* In the Tree Fort where Finn and Jake live, can be seen on a wall a ripped image of an apparently naked woman. However, according to a crew member of the show, it represents "a woman in a crappy snapped bikini".
* Verbal innuendo is somewhat more frequent and includes references to prostitution ("I wanna watch you two do things... for this bag of money"), penetration (VCR tapes go into BMO's "butt", Ice King saying "holes are holes"), genitalia ("someone hit in the boingloings", "only good babies get sassages", mention of the word 'virile'), seduction (Tree Trunks and LSP trying and calling themselves "hot" or "sexy"), rape (the whole plot of "Hug Wolf"), bondage ("I kinda like bein' tied up in these cords. Kinda freaky!"), etc.
* Some songs also contain references to "having babies"; one of them has the following lyrics: "Come on! Give it to me! Don't flaunt it if you're not gonna give it up!" 

Its not Rocket Science. the producers of this show have an agenda, and its not considerate of kids at all. rating this show PG made me interested. This is the same list I gave to my daughter of why we dont choose to watch it. NEXT PROGRAM. we can't even pretend the options are limited.

F. what did I get myself into??

First off, let me thank you so much for having the patience and intelligence to format a clean written response... Even if it is just the parts you copied and pasted of the parental guide from IMDB (user-submitted) that you thought would reinforce your argument best. 

I'm assuming you didn't watch the rest of the show because 99% of these character flaws are heavily dug into and explained through back story and progression. 

Ice King kidnaps princesses because the crown drove him mad at a time when he had just lost the true love of his life. 

Not gonna touch procreation... It just exists. Nature, science, art. It surrounds us entirely and I choose to explain the appropriate parts as I see fit. 

The tier speech could have been an argument point for me if they made a pleasureful joke about tier 15. Reinforcing to stay away from it is fine by me. 

Yes... They censor nudity. PG. 

Butt jokes aren't to everyone's taste :man_shrugging: moving on. 

Finn feeding princess bubblegum spaghetti? Dudes courting her in order to ask for a piece of her hair to save Jake from an insecure balding witch. PB is the main love interest of Finn at this point and correlates well when he immediately ruins his perfect date to get back to saving his bro.

Finn going into the bathroom to see if the coast is clear, showing extreme embarrassment, and exclaiming how they need to leave is a more accurate description in my book.

BMOs gesture of putting their fingers in things is contextual in that they are reading old nursery rhymes thinking they are ancient spellbooks. While reading little Jack Horner, the line "stuck in his thumb, pulled out a plumb, and said oh what a good boy am I" specifically. BMO had a new video game called super good boys and made circles with his hands above the controllers. 

[quote="DeepSeaSwan, post:80, topic:92677"]
‚ÄúMy most private parts seen by a boy!‚Äù
[/quote]

The quote is actually "My most private parts, *peeped* by boy!" again, with embarrassment being the tone. They are in the swamp of embarrassment after all. I am comfortable with and would encourage any parent to discuss their private areas and the threat of real perverts in the world. My son asked what a pervert was during that episode and we had a necessary talk about this beautiful world that some sick people exist in. 

All the little people explores being over-controlling as Finn is given God like control over miniature figurines by one of the most dubious antagonists, magic man. He quickly learns how messing in the relationships (both romantic and friendly) of others and being inconsiderate towards emotions ends up with his own miniature character being depressed and alone. Another strong moral lesson to be learned. 

Very clear seven minutes in heaven reference. I flashed back to the first time I played and had no idea what I was supposed to do with the girl. The episode immediately pivots to Finn and pb going into the closet and ditching the party instead because the game is lame. They go on a best friend's adventure instead while the rest of the candy kingdom freaks out about why they've been in their for so long, debating whether they are dead or just passed out from lack of oxygen. 

I agree that the breezy episode went too far with some of the sexuality aspects. I don't play that often. 

Ricardio explicitly explains things are consensual...
https://youtu.be/C6Wdf5PjFwU

Jake likes being kissed by the nurse clowns to fix his boo-boos which Finn thinks is super creepy. It is.

They are teen boys living in a tree house. Yes, they have a ripped poster of a bikini babe. They even call them bikini babes. 

Jake goes money crazy trying to get rid of all their gold and makes two people sleep on the opposite sides of the bed as they usually do. Bmo is a robot, it's a butt joke. The whole plot of hug wolf is rape?! Is a werewolf that hugs instead of mauling people. Entirely appropriate and not rapey. 

PG stands for parental guidance as it should. This is episode by episode and not representative of the entire show. I don't let my son watch any TV shows without me watching them first or at least with him.
Definitely lots of undertones, can't argue with that. It seems to be the trend in.... Just about everything these days. Go back and watch Shrek lol. Good luck with your build, I hope you don't let your opinion of a tv show carry any grudge against me and my choice of avatar.
