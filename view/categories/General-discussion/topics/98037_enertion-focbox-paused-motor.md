Hi, I have been using Enertion Focbox. Recently, I found sometimes the motor suddenly paused. After replacing to a new Focbox, the problem went away. I am wondering if anyone had the same problem. Does that mean the VESC is bad?

When you say "paused", do you mean locking up, or just not responding? If it's the latter, then it might be a faulty receiver cable

I meant the board just stopped. After about half or one second, it started to run again.

Does this problem persist?

Yes, it is very repeatable.

Also, after it recovered, it ran faster than the commanded speed, feels like the VESC knew it paused and tried to catch up.
