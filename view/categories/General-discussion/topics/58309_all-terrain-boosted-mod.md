Does anyone have pics of a board AT mod or does anyone know if the evolve at kit or the TRAMPA tires fit on the board board?

I saw this video, but at least u need good 3d printer with 3m teeth profile. by the looks of it he fitted a large bearing to the pulley to get support from the truck. Which is caliber 2 from V1. V2 use different .
also u will loosed lots of speed. he is using like 3:1 ratio and suffer from torq. i mean the motor is way too small. for this job.
lastly enertion do not make that 5 inch wheels. it was prototype. closest I can find is these, http://www.diyeboard.com/6-15050mm-70a-airless-allterrain-wheels-with-hubs-pulleys-p-587.html
and they are 6inch wheels

So there is no kit for plug and play. it jst too extra mile. to make it work.

What he said ☝️

I really wouldn’t do it. I mean just look at how tiny these Boosted motors are. Get a set of Popoca wheels and call it a day.

To be honest, the boost board looks amazing on its original wheels, looks bad on pneumatics.

Trampa boards look amazing on pneumatics, a Landy Evo on wide trucks looks also nice on pneumatics.

if you want to ride on grass this is not a bad option.

You can also order a custom wheels from them. I'd ask them for Popoca wheels.

Try the MBS 100mm AT wheels. Just 3D print a new pulley and try to fit that. Not the absolute best for off road, but a great enduro option.
