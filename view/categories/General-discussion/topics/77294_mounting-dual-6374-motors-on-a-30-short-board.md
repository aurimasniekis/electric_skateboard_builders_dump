Hey guys. 

So I've decided to buy a 30inch short board deck bc I like the way they handle. I was wondering if it we're possible to have a dual drive on the board with 6374 149kv motors. Will they fit? Bc they seem kinda large.....

Thanks in advance

depends on the width of the hanger not the deck. Also the type of mount ect.

Overkill tbh.  The trucks have to be too wide for most traditional kickers and a 30 cut away just looks meh.
Better off with 6355 for the difference in torque.  Just adjust the gearing to suit.

:arrow_up: You definitely want dual 6355

Yes it's possible. However you'll need a longer truck, something like TB 218mm or e-Caliber. If you want to use Caliber 2, then you'll have to mount in diagonal to accommodate the 74 length of two 6374s.
So, **in most cases**, the motor diameter is limited by your motor mount, and the length is limited by your truck axle length.

Thanks for the input guys. What about a dual 6364 (190kv)?

What truck? Caliber 2 fits maximum 55 in length.

I'm not exactly sure what are the trucks available. Can any accommodate dual 6463?

This sounds nuts. Build it please and show us a video where it shoots out from under you. 
Because it will definitely do this. If you full throttle like I always do. To find out what Iâ€™m getting myself into.

I'm looking at doing exactly this with the 6355 duals. and 218 TB Trucks

You don't really need the tb trucks for those 6355. Unless you want wider belts.

Do one motor in front and one behind

Does the board have a tail?

If you really want to do this --

with tail:
one motor in front of front truck on right side
one motor in front of rear truck on left side

without tail:
one motor in front of rear truck on left side
one motor in back of rear truck on right side

But as folks have suggested, Caliber2 with dual 6355 will be better.  This is still a ridiculous amount of power.

I'm tempted to try this setup intrigued to see how it would handle, especially breaking and cornering at speed

@kobra918 
And as for bigger than 6355 on short boards it's a waste you will never 'enjoy' full speed with dual 6374s,  might even get you hurt - be careful with any monster you make :wink:

So a dual 6355 would be torquier than a single 6374?

Normal caliber trucks will fit dual 6355

Alrighty then! I guess I'll go with the dual 6355s then! I'm not sure which motors to buy. Unfortunately turnigy aerodrive has only 260kv 6355s motors  and I find torque boards motors too expensive (I don't want sensor motors). Any recommendations guys? (190kv or lower preferably).

Honestly, the difference between the 190kv and the 170kv is minimal compared to turque and power of the two. 
Anything duel at 170kv pushing enough amps will be a rocket. 
Say with the new unity or a duel set up of the Maytech 6 would allow you to have a 12s5p and enough amps to max motors on 60a x 2

Thanks a bundle @Skunk and @hyperIon1. 
You say these are 170kv. How many turns do they have. And what are 'legs' (sorry noob here). Are the motors rated for 12s? Because I want to use 2 6s lipos in paralell as a power supply.

Leg or nipple
![Screenshot_20181207-161020_Samsung%20Internet|281x500](upload://gXK8OqYxELrRWUvuUmizg4ij103.jpeg) 
So its a 6355 but that leg is a bit longer.

Yes 12s

As long as I can fit it on caliber twos I should be fine. Also I noticed that it's $85 per piece. This is cheap for a sensored motor but I'm trying to cut back so I opted to use sensorless ones. So unless (hopefully) your price is in CAD I may need other recommendations

@hyperIon1 the escs you sell though, will they work for a 12s lipo setup?

they are new, we only tested one on the bench for set up and detection.
I run 6365 on my board and i love them.
as for ESCs rated for lipo all but the mini flip.
the duel maytech 50a is rated for 12s lipo
the singles are as rated for 12s lipo as well
and I have some maytech 100a ESCs coming
