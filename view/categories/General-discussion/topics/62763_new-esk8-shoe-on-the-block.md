Sorry.  I labeled the picture so I figured it would be visible on the forum.  The Pro versions are better since they come with the soft insoles that are removable unlike standard vans.  The high top part is also padded in case you take a tumble.

Actually 2 months of skating is great.
Sliding repeatedly a shoe against a piece of abrasive such as grip tape definitely classifies as extreme use in my book.
When I skated we mostly used airwalk shoes, they lasted ages.
Then someone said that converse all stars were so much better as they gave you a better feel of the board.
So naturally I went and bought some with my pocket money. I tore through them in one session, ONE FREEKING SESSION. I was so upset, I continued skating in them covered in duct tape for months.

Well Converse got bought out by nike and shipped out to china to be made. If you had some old school USA made ones they would have lasted. 

I still have 4 pairs from back in the day that are USA and they are still in one piece.....granted one pair is about 12 years old and held together with some duct tape now....but its all connected so ONE PIECE!

I use Adidas EQT shoes with the ultra boost sole. It's like walking on marshmallows. They really reduce vibration while riding, but it does take a little getting used to the dampened feeling when steering. I tried the adidas Superstars and the converse with the cushioned sole but I couldn't ride in Vans, that sole is like cement.

That is not good. If they are that bad then I need to find some other skate shoe that lasts.
Having to pay 70-90€ for skate shoes if they don't last is not good.
At work I am either in trainers that I have stopped running in since they have accumulated more than 700-1000km or safety boots. Most of these can last years if they are good quality.
Having a shoe end up like the one in @Holyman92 pictures after 1 month of light use is completely unacceptable.
I may need to get me some shoes from the same brand I buy my safety shoes.

These look like they could get the job done. I don't know how the safety toe cap would affect my ollying but this is not a problem with my eskate :smiley:

They look like Chuck Taylors. I still think rubbing canvas against grip tape is a bad idea plus it grips less compared to suede IMO.
This type of shoe should not cost more than 20-30$, everything above that is paying for brand marketing.

It's hard to compare a skate shoe to a  eskate shoe but I used the PF Flyers for skating (like in a park with ramps doing tricks) and tore them apart in a month.
But you can get them on 6 pm.com for like 20 to $30 a pair.

Doc Marten makes a leather high-top that is intended for work industry use. So it has the slip resistant bottom and acid resistant soles. They're made with sealed seams to prevent chemical deterioration I've used them for warehouse and kitchen work for years and they take quite the beating but you're looking at spending $100. I might try those.  Especially because you can get them in a steel toe high top made of leather.

Oh I'm sure.  I wore nothing but Doc Martens till my late twenties. I've definitely thrashed a good Grand worth of their shoes. But I was really surprised how much their Workforce shoes held up. I wouldn't be comfortable riding a skateboard in Boots. I feel like I'd be fighting the leather too much around my ankles. And with how thick the souls are it messes with my depth perception.
Hell I used to sleep in my combat boots but still couldn't ride a skateboard on them to save my life.
Nowadays my skate shoes are typically whatever my last pair of high tops were with strips of Leather Shoe Gooed all over them

what the hell are you all doing on esk8s? How do you wear down your shoes that badly when you are not doing tricks? Back in the day, my Vans last maybe two months at most. 

I just wear shoes, just whatever I'm wearing at the moment which is a pair of beat up cheap Adidas or one of my many pairs of Converses. I need to get that shoe cushion @caustin recommended

a shoe specific to esk8 isn't a bad idea at all.

I esk8 every day and out of a literal herd of longboards with a litter of electrics, and access to a local skate shop where I can ride any commercial board, I choose @trampa 

![c%25XdmsYITPShwfJyZuo2sA|375x500](upload://bXU9grXvIKVncf2MtkJdBhAbiMO.jpg)

I think the Trampa platform can do anything - if I am wearing a proper shoe that reinforces lateral heel stability for my 6' 2", 190 lb. frame.  I do not suggest what I call Air McYeezys lol without bindings on a Trampa.

Here's what I wear:

https://www.amazon.com/Footprint-Insole-Technology-Kingfoam-Orthotic/dp/B00PUHIHIA

I think FP Footwear's insoles are so good that I wear them every day, in every kind of shoe I have (even my dress shoes).  I always wear their skate shoes while flying, now.  Big fan, I wish I knew their supplier.

That being said, I hack Nobull Project Trainers for esk8:

https://www.nobullproject.com/collections/mens-trainers/products/black-ivy-trainer-mens

The Nobull Project shoe upper is made of a new fabric called SuperFabric that holds up exceedingly well (crossfit levels of abuse): http://www.superfabric.com/pages/SuperFabric_Footwear.html 

So for me, my ultimate esk8 shoe are the Nobulls and I spray my shoes and grip tape with this: https://www.amazon.com/Tarrago-Hightech-Nano-Protector-Spray/dp/B003U47QBY

Wipe down with a damp cloth, instantly dry to put back in my suitcase, etc.

My two cents :)

Hello @topcloud, you've taken almost every part of my comments in completely the wrong context and managed to be offended by them. That wasn't my intention at all but I can see how it came off that way. No beef here my friend, just a guy who has space for open cup headphones and limited time in his life :heart_eyes:

Mostly envy in my posts.

Why not just use Loaded Pushin Cushion and wear any skate shoe you want? ;)

Also the best skate shoes are Van Gilbert Crocketts Pro Mids with rogerbros brake soles. :P
