Hey guys! Sorry if it's a little dull but I'm planning to use belt covers on my next DIY but I'm not sure if the most common belt covers will match my setup (caliber 2 truck, Torque Board new motor mount (two pieces clamp, reversible), Torque Board 16/36 teeth gear ratio, 15mm wide belt). My belts never last long due to rocks. I was looking at this cover but there are no dimensions on the item details:

I made some covers for 12mm belts and 90mm wheels for my TB motor mounts. I can edit the file and send them over for 15mm belts and your wheel diameter if you'd like.

I'm not sure if their new mounts has the same dimensions as the old ones.

What wheels are you intending to use?

@torqueboards could you advise, Dexter?

I'm now using 97 but i'm gonna upgrade to ABS 100mm all terrain. I guess I will go for 100mm so it can also fit 97mm. I also have the old mount let me compare the two

Belt covers won't help you.
The part of the belt that gets hit by rocks is the part closer to the ground on the wheel pulley.
Only an enclosed system would provide any protection.
I have come to find out that the only thing belt covers do is add time and effort for when you want to change a belt.

I mean it really depends on why you are printing them, I just think they look cool.

also @nuttyjeff I realized I have the V3 mounts with the round motor part instead of the V4 lol.  Do these work for the reverse mounts as well?

I think the one you have is also reversible! It's the exact same mount except that the newer one comes with a two pieces clamp. the spot where the cover will sit is the same.

I got tired of removing these small rocks from the inside of the belts. For me the cover helps a lot, but as you say, stones keep scratching from underneath and since I ruined one belt every week commuting, I made this sweet design :grin:.. The stones gets pushed away..  made ~400km on the same belts since that :grinning:

If it works for you that is great.
On my commuter board I use no belt covers nowadays with no problems and I ride on streets that are anything but clean.
On my mountain board however, the underside of the enclosed pulley cover on the wheel is full of marks from the contact with rocks.

No idea, but probably not. I made it for TB mounts. Given the appropriate dimensions of other mounts, I can design different motor pulle6 covers for ya'll to print (:

I use Nylon PA12, but PETG or even PLA should work fine. PLA might deform if your motors get too hot though.

Yeah, a pulley cover is certainly doable :slight_smile:

You'd have to drill through the mount and thread the hole to mount the cover though.
