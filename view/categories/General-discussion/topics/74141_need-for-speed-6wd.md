I need the esk8 gods advice for 6wd.  I lost a street drag to a GXR. 

Dualee rear sounds strange, but have you seent it? Have you ridden it? 

I’d kinda like to try a quad rear (plus two front obvi), hear me out. Think typical rear dual, rear facing, than add another dual rear, but front facing. 

Should I just suck it up and buy another two vesc6 and put them up front too and get big motors?

Sincerely,
Goes fast, but not fast enough

What if you put 4 drive wheels on one axle?  Or put pulleys on the inside and outside of each of the two back wheels?  So each wheel had two pulleys and two motors...

I’m not really sure here... did you lost again a GTX or a GTR... 

Because the solution could be different depending on the outcome... for one I would say to change the motor gear, for the other one to put a twin turbo v6 on your board...

For this project, I'd honestly go with a standard 4WD, 4 vescs, and a massive battery that can push a ton of amps... Consider high C lipos even if you want it to just race and not go extremely far.

More battery amps are going to help more imo than just adding more vescs and motors to the same tires...

Regardless of how many motors and vescs you tack in, the battery is going to max out at some point. Adding 2 more vescs to an already 4 vesc/4 motor setup just means trimming your battery max to meet your batteries ability to push amps per vesc... And you end up with the same overall wattage/power, albiet with slightly better efficiency *maybe* or maybe not due to the additional drivetrain friction from two more belts/gears and motors.
 
And if you want speed, gear for speed... Just throw more amps and cool your vescs with massive heatsinks!! 

That's my advice. A better battery, push a ton more amps at each wheels vesc, pumping those motors to their max wattage. If your wheels don't spin out, consider then getting two more motors, mounts and vescs if your battery still has headroom to push more amps. If your wheels are spinning out though, for however long they are spinning out, you have reached your max potential power output unless you add more, softer, grippier tires... 

Good thread. Can't wait to see where you take this. We need more excessively overpowered builds for me to cream over, not just the standard 12-13S high discharge lipo quad drives or 13S12P 240A battery max quad drives... Lol /s those are standard... Come on guys!!!

PS, since someone asked, more amps won't increase top speed.. more amps increases torque which requires more cells in Parallel. More 
cells in Seriess (higher voltage) and gearing for higher speed will give you higher speed.

[/quote]


@Arzamenable  @Mikenopolis switching from 4 -> 6 motors gives 1.5x as much thrust/acceleration (or about 50% more acceleration but roughly the same top speed).

if you want more top speed with the 6 motors but the same acceleration as 4 motors...

1 / 1.5 factor of increase of acceleration = 0.66666

^with 6 motors instead of 4 motors, multiply the current gear ratio by 0.666... for ~1.5x as much top speed, but the same acceleration as 4 motors.

[quote="Arzamenable, post:1, topic:74141"]

[/quote]

...but if in fact you just want more acceleration but the same top speed, just slap an extra pair of motors on your board. you could also reduce your wheel size (by 0.666x) or increase your gear ratio (by 1.5x) for more acceleration without the extra motors, but these options would reduce your top speed (by 0.666x). another option to achieve the same acceleration you'd get by adding 2 extra motors (without adding 2 motors) is multiply your present motor current limit x 1.5 (but this would increase the motor and controller heating by a factor of 1.5^2 = 2.25x, and have no effect on top speed).

I'm not sure if it's been mentioned but you might want to look into pneumatics or even buy some race wheels from @MoeStooge  for some better off the line grip. But to awnser your original question I don't think 6wd is your solution. 4wd and put your vescs in a aluminum case totally exposed to the air like @sk8l8r did on his evo build, some big motors, and tattu lipos is probably your best bet.

I’ve never had heat issues, both sets of vescs have a large exposed aluminum heatsink. Maybe 130f is my personal heat record. 110s f average I think. 

I don’t think I can be persuaded away from sixshooters.

I was recently thinking about how to make my 4wd mountain board even faster. Top speed is fine but as fast as my board launches off the line, I need it to go faster. 

I’m not sure that 6wd is the answer though. There are many larger motors available. Like massive..

Run more current motor and battery’s wise, increase battery size, introduce active cooling, that’s will I’ll be doing anyway

Well you get more with more settings, but even with the same settings, its just different consumption of current :) For e.g. just to move board from standstill it requires more power than with smaller motors :) not like by small margin but by a lot :) Also with same settings I lost half of range so it means motors consume more power (internal resistance is much lower which means in any way it consumes more current)

EDIT: yes it feels kinda day and night you press a bit of throttle and it just pushes you back on the board. Some people were even scared to ride it :D

I’m confused. Ur saying with ur 80xx size motors they’re taking more power for the same acceleration off the line as the 60xx and also less efficient on the straight?  I’d have thought the bigger motor would be slightly faster off the line w the same settings and also more efficient on a flat continuous.

I don't know who spread the idea that bigger motor the more efficient it is... Because on the same idea it would mean you can pick up 200200 motor and ride without much current :smiley:

Torque in motor is proportional to the air gap flux, number of conductors in the slots and current in those conductors. Assuming the air gap flux density stays the same, then a longer stator will mean more air gap flux and your torque will increase. At the same time, a longer stator will slightly increase the total length of your wire, so your resistance will increase and that will cause the torque to drop slightly, but because your motor is longer, it also has the ability to dissipate more heat which increases your rated torque. So the overall effect is a longer motor will increase torque, assuming every other parameter of the motor stays the same.

So talking same current and throttle position bigger motor will product more torque. 

But because 80100 are much bigger and has more and bigger bearings, bigger magnets and etc it has much more resistance to spin so current consumption is higher to start it moving so efficiency drops, but because you have more torque it kinda counters it and in the end you have more torque but higher current consumption and oh boy its 3 AM and my head doesn't work anymore... :D

I don't know if my paragraphs even makes sense... :D

Bigger bearings can take more amps but u could work it so it wasn’t much difference.  

Magnetic cogging of a bigger motor is there but disappears under power or at least is no longer a resistance 


The copper losses would go down for sure with the bigger motor and often the source of most loss but maybe the big motor has more iron losses.

I am tired of arguing with a guy who does excel sheet calculations vs real life differences... :D

So for e.g. 2kW on 1cm stator will heat everything up and will start losing its torque, and 1m stator will not even heat up a bit and will not have any loses. So which will produce more torque?

I had graphs comparing same current settings on 6384 and 80100 and graphs are like day and night riding style didn't changed as I was riding even slower at beginning as I was shit load scared to even push :)

Here you go 80100 vs 6384 running at ±80A mot/bat nothing else changed pretty much apart 1kg difference but that's like eating lunch :slight_smile:

at the upper end of the speed range, if your current is limited by the battery current limit (and if this battery current limit value is lower than the motor current limit), you'll get more torque with the larger stator because the same number of electrical watts will produce more motor current at the same rpm & kv.

but if the battery current limit and the motor current limit are the same value and neither stator saturates, you'll get the same torque with both motors regardless of stator size (but the smaller motor will draw more battery amps to produce more ohmic heating, but the same torque)

Saturation at like 0.2 duty? It's zero speeds man I doubt that it reached saturation...

the less iron, the less current it takes to magnetically saturate at the same kv...

So in the end bigger stator produce more torque at same current?

if the same motor current magnetically saturates the smaller motor and not the larger one, then yes.

So bigger stator will always not saturate faster than smaller one...

your bigger stator also could have been lower kv, in which case the same motor current produces more torque before saturation.

I measured it's almost on point to smaller one :)

Edit: 178 vs 182

```
km or size constant is defined as the torque(Nm) per sqrt(electrical watt)

so divide the torque in newton meters by the square root of electrical watts and you'll always get the same number with the same motor can and stator regardless of how you rewind for different kv as long as you keep the same copper volume.

Yes but we are talking that bigger stator same kv produce more torque

ultimately the larger stator (same kv) can produce more torque, but only because it takes more motor current to magnetically saturate the stator.

U could have a bigger motor with same kv but the stator be designed badly for high torque and thinner at the tooth ends and then the bigger stator tooth ends could saturate first.  Unlikely.

6 shooters are definitely a good choice. Since vesc heat isn't an issue at this point I think it's a matter of how many amps your battery can give you. I'd recommend getting some tattu lipos and turning those batt and motor max settings up higher.

wiki: "Saturation puts a practical limit on the maximum magnetic fields achievable in ferromagnetic-core [electromagnets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnet) and [transformers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformer) of around 2 T, which puts a limit on the minimum size of their cores. This is one reason why high power motors, generators, and [utility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_utility) transformers are physically large; because they must have large magnetic cores."

I’m at 35 battery A, 70 motor amps. Using FOC x4 on 200kv motors. 15:42, 1:2.8 ratio. 

I suppose I should be on lipos if I want more. 

Folks here got lipo recommendations?

Motor controller popped for now. I’ll find some lipos and get better controllers. Thank you all. 
@Kug3lis where are your giant 80100s from? Maytechs?
