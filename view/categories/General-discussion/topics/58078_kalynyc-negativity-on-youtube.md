So I'm not sure where to post this or how to title this. Please change or let me know how I should name this.

I stumbled onto this video which was posted in December 2017. It is titled "Electric longboard with the shortest range and poor signal/handling" with the following description as of June 6th 2018

 **"Do not purchase from Kaly.NYC his quality or parts and customer service is horrible. Don't pay cash or Paypal Family transfer so you don't get scammed by Ernesto. Shady guy! Sells bad refurbished esc and poor quality parts. Does not stand behind his product nor offers any warranty."**

As I watched the video I remembered it being a video that was **originally** used to show that the KalyNYC board has a 23 mile range (a positive video) so I assume this person just renamed the video and description which now shines a negative light on @Kaly so I thought I would bring it to all of your attention. Ernesto, not sure what the issue with this guy is, but this is slander and needs to be pulled down.

I remember reading on Reddit or some other place that this guy who has been slandering Ernesto, also borrowed some camera or sorts of equipment and did not return.

@Mikenopolis @Kaly Ernesto is far far from being scam, and he is one of the true honest builder out there, 

[quote="Mikenopolis, post:1, topic:58078"]
Sells bad refurbished esc and poor quality parts.

That is funny because that guy who as post this Video is Vitali, and you know those bad refurbish ESC are mine and he as no problem buying them from me...

That thread is laughable lol. Dude tried to call out Kaly and he got downvoted HARD. 

However, youtube is youtube, not the forum and he can call that video whatever he wants.

I know that!  Just a PSA

Those comments were all made before the title and description were changed into negativity. It was originally a range test. 

Thanks for changing the title @JohnnyMeduse

I know this guy and met him a few times. For all his projects he was kissing Ernesto's ass all the time for help and parts. From what I've seen he is trying to get free stuff for putting up YouTube videos (please look at his videos praising the Chinese boards he got for free) and once he couldn't get stuff he threw a fit. He is a little baby. He also cut other people's videos without credit or permission to creat videos. Do not trust this guy.

I actually watched this video a few days ago and was confused as it basically shows how awesome the board is...also because @Kaly has a stellar reputation. Probably what annoys me the most about the internet (I know I sound old now), almost zero accountability for shit talking.

This is why I'm so hesitant to ever sell stuff.

And its always the people who want to get free stuff that will turn around and stab you in the back.

I worked with a skate company few years back, and probably some of the worst damage done to the brand was by some of the sponsored riders who decided they didn't like the product anymore.

I have personally witnessed his interactions with @Kaly as I and many of the riders in NYC frequent Ernesto’s shop, because of his excellent reputation, stellar customer service and generally great personality, and this guy is the fullest of shit person that I have ever met. Many of us in the NYC Collective (not that I speak for them all) know that Vitalie is a scammer himself. Glad the eskate community can see through bullshit, call it out when necessary, and see the real.

Son of a bitch! Looked into his channel. And he renamed another one of the Kaly videos with that bullshit lie again. 

It’s so stupid because the video title is now a click bait, but the content is positive and shows the awesome builds.

This is such a poor way to... well do anything.

What does he think this is going to accomplish?

Youtube doesn't work this way.
He's just going to tank some of his channels most valuable videos.

Hello everyone 
Thank you for your support. 

The issue with Vitalie was that for a year he was praising my boards and then wanted to get finance by me for a baja board project and that’s when things went south. 

He thought that I should compensate him for posting videos of my boards on his channel, that was not going to happen because I don’t pay for videos and less under a threat of bad publicity, that to me is extortion. 

I contacted YouTube and was able to remove 2 videos, the rest YouTube informed me that the content of the video don’t have anything offensive and that those not violate their policies. 

On the tittle. 
The only way should be to sue him on libel but that is a long battle. 

Thanks everyone and this guy is just a sour person that praises me on his videos and them changes the title, man what a lame person.

At least Tishawn is a awesome person & customer

About this guy, what a cok sucker literally :banana: 

He must have been getting a lot of bad karma, not only on reddit but in life, these kind of people just disappears one day and nobody cares about them, what a poor way to live the life.

Please post more often, we miss your build threads!

before I unsub, he said that he is going to put foxbox to mellow board motors, and 100 batteries to baja with vesc 6 something like that, and never been featured on his video. I think he borrowed those, anyways
55mph lol, he has no balls to do that. never seen him doing even 40.
then he was posting other people's board and EVs and what not, so I unsubed.
just full of bull crap.

@Kaly we don't do ads or youtubers either. Let your work speak for itself, the haters gonna hate, and everyone else will love you. 

we're also putting an end to "special projects". they always devolve into who owes who what and why, basically what you're describing here.

it could be argued that you are now a public figure, a brand, and in that case, libel laws would not be in your favor... unfortunately.  Let the sphere of public opinion do your justice...

You are right on the special projects.

Fuck this guy. 

@kaly (Ernesto) is the reason I didn't buy a Boosted or an Evolve. When I started last year, he helped me build an Urban Carver by providing parts, guidance and advice. He's been nothing but friendly, helpful and generous. 

I'm going to bash this idiot in the comments of his video and report it as spam. It's the least I can do. It's the least we can all do in fact.

I'll argue that brigading is more scummy than what this guys trying to do.

And there's no point.
This guys not going to be getting any traction with this. Its pretty transparent that its a personal issue.

Brigading and that sort of retaliation will often cause more harm than good.

All you need to do is when it comes up is, vouch for KalyNYC builds. If people ask about this guy that swears they're crap, explain it to them.
