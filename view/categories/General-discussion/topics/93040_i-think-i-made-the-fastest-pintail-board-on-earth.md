Been moving, pretty busy. I think I can make this claim. 

The ride I made for my non diy buddy is real fast. It’s not just capable on paper (or esk8 calc) , but it’s actually in the right hands do damage on earth.

I dunno, fight me, I think I’m right.

He does high 30s on double kingpins with slop bushings. I tell him daily, “this is how you get cancer”. 

My top speed is high 40s, I catch him on straight flats, but he gives zero f’s about traffic, turns, or lights.

The only other **pintail** esk8 I have come across is the teamgee so reckon you're bang on the money.  Big claim and I expect a lot of testosterone will be displayed before this is over but I bet none of them read the bloody title.  Looks like a beast and sounds like a proper board.  Nice job

:open_mouth:

I love DKP but mixed with high 30s is a no-no

My newest is DKP with slop bushings front with 23 degree RKP rear, and I'd do high 30s on that

Look, humble dude here with a buddy who Needs esk8 as a form of therapy. 

If it’s top speed you want, we will go find a radar sign and force him on stable trucks. 

If it’s all round  maneuverability, I’ll fix my damn Rylo and track a real fast run when I get my 4wd raceboard moving again. I’ve been on a bendy trampa lately because... I’m lazy. 

Also, I’m trying like hell to drag him to Colorado

But that’s the point. I can smoke my buddy on a track. I would wager actual money that he in the top 5% on a rando street course. 

His average ride speeds are stupid. I trail behind watching close calls and wishing I brought a neck brace and acls crash cart to a “casual” sunset run.

And yeah man, the EUC is literally unbeatable with the turn radius, the carves, but the most important part you don't really have to carry it when you go into buildings, I've honestly stopped riding boards ever since I got myself an EUC.

All good as long as all goes well. You yang, you cool. Things go easy. You have enough time to learn your lessons. According to Murphies law shit happens just to people which take care about everything. So you should be good. Just be grown up enough to understand that you have responsibility not only for you, also for people living with you in one house...

One last thing, wtf is that?

I hope there is some kind of isolation under, not only the shrink tube from the cell.

It wouldn't matter even if it broke through the shrink tubing as long as the nickel is spot welded onto the negative side of the battery

Yes it's spot welded to the negative side, I just put fishpaper their to prevent heatshrink from melting when soldering

Don't worry about the bent nickel I intentionally bent the pack to see the strength

Ugh. I absolutely HATE pintail decks.  I like a wider stance and to me it’s silly to have the thinner parts of the board right where I like to have my feel.

All in all though, that’s a sweet ass build and I wish I had someone fun and fast to ride with like you. My girlfriend rides with me, but if she is going >25MPH it’s a miracle.

All critics are only constructive ideas people can use or not. That’s how I see if people comment on my stuff. All there to learn from or just ignore if I think I know better 💁‍♂️

All jokes. I can understand not wanting to go crazy but it’s fun riding with people who do.

You can say what you want I just don’t like that folding method. If just one strip is not in place, vibration can push the corners into the cell and short it out.

Don't worry....

The welds are Soo strong, it pulls the terminal up then the nickle strip rips...

Fiber tape will also be added to reinforce the pack

I speak about the place between the rows where the nickel folded. I don’t like that technique. Doesn’t matter how strong your welds are. Cutting corners is super important when doing that.

Have you seen the pintail I have, it’s huge and wide as hell, I literally can’t decide on how to space my feet out when I’m riding it.

I mean, it’s all personal preference. I like to have a stiff deck & concave to my deck too (like the bustin robot) or foot pockets like a Switcblade. Pintails tends to be more flexy and I have never seen a pintail with a concave or foot pockets.

Basically you get the classic look but give up some of the modern advancements in deck pressing. And IMO if it’s an esk8, I get the latest tech of everything so why not get the latest decks too.

That being said, pintail builds kinda reminds me of a “classic car” vibe. Not the latest tech, but unmatched retro style. I just am not a retro dude.

I don't understand how that works or where it goes, I've never seen a photo of it mounted.  

Plus, DKP front and 23° RKP rear is pretty hard to beat.

Let me know when they start to wear out. I've got lots of them. In black also.

When I first made them I wanted to keep the nuts from digging into my deck ln my evolve gtx and to reduce vidrations directly to the baseplate and deck. I've seen a few evolves with overtightened bolts and split decks or cracks developing in that area. After that I sort of added some stuff to make the arm part of the dkp have feedback throughout the curve of the turn just by rubbing against the semisoft material. I've sense updated the design to be more accurate and consistent where the kingpin arm makes contact with the "dampener" lets call it. I just need to print and have someone test it. I like how carvey evolves feel because of the trucks and wanted a simple solution to wobbles at higher speeds (like occasional overspeed from a hill) without doing a bunch of work like reworking the drive train on an evolve or losing that carvey feel from dkp.
