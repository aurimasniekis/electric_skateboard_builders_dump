I promise I searched before asking this. I understand that larger wheels help go over rocks, cracks, and philly potholes. But I was wondering if it helps the stability any. Like with speed wobbles. Or does it make a difference at all. So if I was riding at the higher speed I typically ride (so far not over 20mph), would larger wheels cause me to have a lesser chance of speed wobbles than if I was doing the same on my normal wheels. I'm switching from 97mm to 150mm and am curious.

Ya mean 105mm? No what helps with speed wobbles is better bushings. Get some riptide APS bushings. Those things are the bomb...

The larger wheels will increase your speed quite a bit so they could make speed wobbles worse just get some good bushings or tighten your trucks to prevent speed wobbles

I got them so I can have a smoother ride. I still will be kick pushing to start and also keeping my same speed limits more or less. I'm still trying to get the motor/pulley connected, plus I'm replacing the busted deck with a slightly longer one. So I haven't had the chance to test it and won't until probably next week at the soonest.

The one issue I've seen with tightening the trucks (the last group ride was faster than my norm) is that it's harder to make turns. I do have a kick tail but turns I was used to making I couldn't lol

The right bushings will help with speed wobble and not force you to tighten the truck too much for turning
Might also consider wedge and/or diff baseplate angle

I'll look into that, but while we're on the subject, I'm still having issues finding the proper belt to fit. So far I've bought 3 different ones. None of which fit properly. I'd like the same width so it still fits the motor Pulley, but longer to compensate for the wheel pulley. The one that sort of fits length says 5m-450-20. It's too wide to fit the Pulley and a little bit too big to have the right tension. I suppose I could make an idler, but I'd rather get the right size. The current belt doesn't have any numbers on it. ![20180124_203327|666x500](upload://6XrXkW5xPuyJUTdk2JzdyOcnNor.jpg)

Coming mostly from a freeride/downhil background, the wheel of choice for higher speeds or more stability/safety isn't the diameter. Its the contact patch with the road, the correct durometer and bearing position. The faster you want to grip corners the more lip and contact patch you need. 

Those wheels surely are nice for straight, low resistance since there is almost no contact with the street. But as soon as you need to transfer you body commands to the street the amount of contact you have with the pavement is where it's at. 


You also mentioned tightening your trucks worsened the turning for you. Instead of mushing the bushing together, get yourself an angled riser (5-10$) at a skateshop. reduce your back angle to 30-35 degrees. Run  2 duros harder bushings (barrels) board side and you should be fine. Steering is almost exclusively done over the front truck. Harder bushings boardside don't necessarily  mean less turn or lean, just more force needed. Tightening the bushing too much so It cannot work properly will reduce your turn significantly though.,

Cut two belts, staple the ends together wrap it around. Mark it. Count the teeth. Multiply by 5mm. For belt length. Order the right length.


Now you have a broken belt to measure any build you build.. :O

Otang Nipples are some of the worst bushings I I've ever ridden even in camparison to the generec ones that come on caliber clones.... Super unstable. 

Riptide bushings are the best, I'm stable at 40+mph and I can still make slower sharper turns. I got the almost precision kit from Miurskate. It was the best thing I did to my board.

Generally you want softer bushings in the front than in the back. You also want to have the rear truck tighter than the front truck, this keeps rear steer from being a problem. The reason you want different durometers in the front and the back is to avoid oscillations.

If my understanding is correct, and I wouldn't swear in a court of law that it is, wobbles present as small turns at the pivot. 

What I do know is that the easiest way to work.out of a wobble is to carve back and forth.  The second option is to slow down as quickly as possible.  I've also found that a small turn and acceleration will dissipate the oscillation.

Carving deep on a long wheelbase board where you are in the middle.of trucks, not on top of them, like the LY Evo leaves a bit to be desired when returning from the lean. Harder bushings roadside make the return more 'elastic' for lack of a better word. 

Don't misunderstand though, this isn't science just my personal experience with this specific deck.

The belt type depends in the pulley(s) type.  That belt is not htd5m, so it won't work with htd5m pulleys which is what I sent you the models of.

alright wicked. I like that when poeple just try shit out and find something that works for them !

For me though it is the opposite (and also maybe I am just falling in line with the habits of long-boarding in general). 


 "The boardside bushing is like your steering wheel, you want it to react and get compressed as fast as possible because that's where you're transferring the energy in order to turn. The roadside bushing should absorb imperfections on the road and return the truck to its original position, therefore it does not need to compress as fast as the boardside one. Summing it up, softer boardside." 

Fuq me man. This is a thing damn ? :) When I read it I was like:" he must of meant it the other way around"

Usually we run harder bushings (barrels) boardside so our precious precision trucks keep the geometry and don't change to much. Giving us more control and reliability, while also slowing down the return of the lean, again for stability and control.

So you go EXACTLY the other direction and say, gimme some snap, gimme some liveliness and some action. I dig it.

No idea why I am so hyped about this, but if I would ever show up with softer boardside bushings I would be an alien, no kidding for me unheard of.

I dig it.  It's weird, it's just the Evo for me though. All of my other decks are setup opposite. The Evo is just weird. 

Honestly I almost tossed it when I first built it cause it road like a big fat turd, but after experimenting with different risers and bushings and loosening the trucks more than I generally am.comfortable with this is what I came up with.  

Now it's a frikking monster. It's the only board I have that I'm semi-comfortable at 30+ mph.

All the belts look like

**250-5M-15** synchronous timing belt
which means 250mm long, 5mm teeth spacing, and 15mm wide
and 250/5 = 50 teeth total on the belt

So just change up those numbers for what you need after counting how many teeth you need.  Use a pen or marker so you don't miscount

Its got 3 pieces, a piece with a arim, a piece for the inside with no rim and another piece with a rim.  You can add/remove the inside pieces all you want.  I guess you could run without the outside rim but I wouldn't.  18mm is for a 15mm belt.

Oh, that makes sense. The whole thing should fit then. Is it a problem with the pulleys being this close? Remember, this is not the same Pulley I will be using but it's the right size. The teeth don't match up. And on the other truck the motor mount fits closer to the center of the truck. ![20180125_112033|374x500](upload://2uz1DhdLARcPjM7iopvlEfm6ewc.jpg)![20180125_112110|666x500](upload://fz4Vhw02xUo08vArXUgpbRO7l6R.jpg)

For the most part, but you want enough space that there is plenty of tooth contact on the motor pulley.  You just have to test sometimes.  On my 'Glory' build (LY Evo) there isn't what 'appears' to be a lot of space and tooth contact, but there is apparently enough as it never slips and is a torque beast but I'm running 25mm pulleys and belts with dual 6374 motors.

For me 83mm is the same as 97mm wheels. O.k. on 97 you can go over bigger rocks and bla bla bla..😀

But I'm riding my 83mm wheels sometimes in super bad roads. I'm riding over brunches no problem. Actually I hadn't found road I cannot ride with my 83mm wheels. 

O.k. closer to topic: so bigger wheels have nothing to do with making you feel less speed wobbles. I can suggest you from my own experience. At the beginning I had super soft bushings, even how hard I tightened them board still was curving machine. At 44km/h speed wobbles was scary as fuck, but I managed to fight them of by leaning forward and giving nearly all my weight on front wheels, leaving back leg just very light on board. Other thing is when you have wobbles you can make them stop is curve to one side and they will be gone. 

But the most amazing thing how you can still have good turning board but without speed wobbles is: buy  good bushings like riptide, get harder ones. I use 95A. Next is: front truck make loose and rear like 2-3 half turns tighter with skate tool. And experiment: start from super loose front and go up to your desire feeling. Just make sure rear trucks are tighter than front. With this set up your board still be able to turn as you like, but no wobbles.  Of course work on your stance and power of legs too😉

Hope it helps..

These bushings are badass.. ![61e12656764a832329f838bb2dcc18dbfd1b3975_1_375x500|375x500](upload://e7lkUDWzkNqL15p3sdRnVYEVPf3.jpg)

I definitely felt the difference between 76mm and 97mm. Philly has some crappy roads. And it's pothole season. Ive been looking at those bushings. A few others said I should get some.

yeah! 

Experiment and find your way whats suits you best.

Tomorrow I'll be testing new stuff too: barrel/barrel set up with those Riptide barrels 95A.

I'll probably need to make some mud guards with my wheels. 1 thing that was confusing me is which riptide bushings I should get. I know which durometer but there are a bunch of different shapes to choose from.

Get standard size barrel, there are also tall barrels in shop, don't take them, standard size is what you are lookin for. Now you need to decide go with barrel/barrel set up or with barrel/cone?! I tried barrel/cone set up and now I'll be testing barrel/barrel set up. Barrel/cone is less stable in theory, I'll test tomorrow and will see.

If you need help with bushings talk to Brad from riptide in the "bushing set up" thread, I mean you can't get any better than talking to the guy who makes them!

He is the pro Sapphi, I'd let him make that decision. 
Have a read of the topic and give him what you can. Likely he might save you money in not having to try a zillion combinations to get your setup right. We really are lucky to have him here helping.
Brad has already seen and liked my post suggesting you ask him in his "bushing set up" thread so I think it is fair to say he is happy to help you.

Not gonna lie, machining that out of AL is gonna be hard and expensive.  The endmill alone is $30.  The 3/4" aluminum block is gonna be spendy too, $35 a shot for an 8"x8"x3/4" piece of 6061.  Then there's the machine time.  This is a multi-operation piece.  roughing the outer shape and pocketing the inner circles with a larger endmill, then moving to the smaller one for the teeth.  Just gonna be a long time.

Oh, and weight.  It's gonna weigh about two pounds all by itself, which is the opposite direction of where you want to go. - lighter

have you considered those versapulleys?  At $6 seems like it would be worth a try before moving on to a super custom part.

to answer the topic tittle, a park deck has tiny wheels cause a low COG is stable, big wheels go over rough terrain better than small wheels but are not more stable on a groomed surface...

Foot fatigue and vibrations are annoying. Though wheels would be one of the last things I would change to counter that. First would be decent skateshoes. There are a lot out there. I love my oldschool high top vans pro model. Good dampers already in. Next step: Get some proper vibration dampening insoles for your shoes. Usually found in  specialist trekking stores or in random skateshops. Secondly put 2 brake soles underneath your shoes, prevents destryoing them and dampens it even more, will still give you enough feel (some are crappy and usless and are super slippery). Added bonus you stick on your griptape, mine are just old racing slick tires chopped and sliced then put under my shoes.  

If all that isn't enough try vibration dampening hard foam. Lay it under the griptape. With all that you ride on a cloud even with 82a + wheels.

I love my Gilbert Crockett Pro Mid wish they still made them... I gotta sand the sole even and replace it with a Roger Bros soon... I wish I had put an alternative sole on when they were new so I'd have a perpetual fresh flat mating surface Everytime I needed a new sole

I have a couple nice pairs of skate shoes. I switched those when I first had vibration issues with the hub motors way back when. I specifically want bigger wheels since it's pothole season and they're everywhere. Actually I got 2 flat tires on my car on Tuesday... Roads are crappy right now. It happens every year from the Salt and snow.

I come from an online skate/trick skate background. My trick skate wheels were always more similar to skateboard wheels but I could slide/slip easier. Way less grip but I used it to my advantage. My other pair of skates were your typical thin skate wheels but they were way more grippy and smooth riding. They were great at skating rinks or even using them to street skate to the skatepark. I was thinking that would transfer well to the commuter board.

It's not that it's that much trouble, it's that it's going to create it's own set of problems.  Maybe the ideal solution is the 3D printed pulley, but using steel bolts for clamping instead of those larger 3D printed pins.
