The hypocrisy here is great. You copied a 10 year old trampa design and somehow made it look worse and pretend like you came up with somehing new :rofl:. Pretty hilarious

Around the time you get over trampa and stop acting like a bitter ex girlfriend after you got dumped :slight_smile:

Just stop bud. You're being a dick, border lining vendor bashing, which is not allowed on this forum. 

@Kaly has consistently produced amazing products that are in high demand in the esk8 world.  

If you don't like it, just move along. Your comments are not needed.

I don't want to be a troll, but I too fail to see the fun in this. My first thought when I saw the deck was "this looks very much like trampa". The design is cooler than trampa but the similarity is clearly there.

![50|690x318](upload://ufhseoxDUIQYtUMMtCxSPm0G557.jpeg) 

In fact, there's a lot of similarity. If the HolyPro deck didn't exist and they released it today, how many people would claim their free Kaly deck?

But camber and concave doesn't always go hand in hand. Someone already pointed out in the clone deck flex test video how the deck in flexing only in the middle :slight_smile:

Not true. He opened a thread pretending that Trampa would claim design on his deck when hes the one who copied trampas design in the first place.

Fair enough. Still, even if trampa did do the same kind of upgrade to their deck, I don't feel like Kaly would be in the position to call them copycats given how much inspiration he has taken from their design.

That's not the point I'm arguing.  Im saying that for years people have asked Frank specifically for these changes and he has refused to implement them.  @Kaly did, I don't see how anyone can get upset over that.  

Lets not forget that the construction is different even if the appearance is similar.  Also, in any industry iterative design is just a thing (thank you for that @DerelictRobot) .  If someone can take a specific design element and make it better, its not infringement, its outhinking your competition.

If Frank all of sudden decides to add concave and reduce the flex, I think any logical person would see that as infringement as those upgrades are already in place and he literally had years to implement them but didn't, assumedly because he didn't think they were marketable.

This thread is amusing.  We all love trampa quality but most of us don't like their policy. Apple has proved that their market strategy works...they also proved that works only for a while. 
Trampa guys have been screwing up things to all vendors in the way to put "THEIR PRICE" starting with vesc and ending with their last compatible nut. A well respected seller is releasing a new product and i read a lot of "copycat crap" lol.
Trampa got what they deserve.  A good competitor.

First of all, our decks are not made of carbon - gf - epoxy. Epoxy-Carbon-GF splits on the first impact since it is hard and brittle. Trampa decks are made of a raw material that we actually make and weave ourselves, since it is not a material you can just buy anywhere. The material itself, it's weaving patterns and moulding technique are the magic. We can weave every layer differently to achieve the beautiful flex and torsion properties that make our decks so outstanding. 
A Trampa deck will swallow the worst impact without splitting. You might see some scratches, but that is about it. This is why we give a life time warranty. We replaced some decks that have had bad accidents, simply because we want our customers to know that buying a Trampa deck is a worry free invest that will last your life time. 

A clone might look similar, but that is about it. The magic is in the material itself. 
Concave is debatable and hinders the deck to flex over the entire length of the board. 
Some users made themselves simple flexible wedges to ad concave and that solution seams to be by far the better way to ad the desired foot stance area concave. The underside stays flat to mount a wider tray, the flex is not affected and the wedge can be printed to meet your individual requirements. I will invest some time into R&D of user specific concave wedges. Would be a nice feature.  

For the ones with a printer: 
https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3145193
and
https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3227325

Finally we have our production line back to normal, after a moving to a new facility and installing all machines on new beds. New, special electric HS 11 style decks are on the way to us, no holes, perfect for under board enclosures. We stretched them a bit and added some width, be surprised. 
We did a lot of deck R&D since mid of last year and we hope to show you some results within the next couple of weeks. We never stopped moving forward!

[/quote]

I find this doubtful.  You may have a custom weave manufactured for your sole use, but I just cannot see you guys having an entire facility for weaving.  There is far too much caustic material required, the licenses alone would be millions anywhere in a european country.  Maybe its just a translation issue that you made that claim, I hope so.

[quote="trampa, post:43, topic:84406"]
The magic is in the material itself.
[/quote]

This is where we, and a lot of people, disagree.  The absence of concave and being required to use bindings, as there is no other way to 'lock in' is why a lot of people do not use your decks for street.  The presence of concave and the ability to 'lock in' without bindings is why @kaly's deck is so valuable.

That's the point though isn't it?  Add ons wil never be as strong or true as a manufactured/pressed deck.  @kaly's deck gives you all of this without having to re-do it every few months.
