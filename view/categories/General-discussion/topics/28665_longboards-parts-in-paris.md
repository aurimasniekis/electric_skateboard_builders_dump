Hey folks,

I'm looking for any longboards parts in Paris. Do you know of any longboards stores there?

My interests are on the following parts:
- Loaded Vanguard (I prefer flex 1 or 2).
- 80mm Orangatang Kegel wheels.
- Caliber II Fifty.

Thanks!

Thank you guys, I've contacted him.

Would love to hear more options as it doesn't seem on his site that he sells Loaded Vanguard deck and 80mm Orangatang Kegel wheels.

Thanks.
