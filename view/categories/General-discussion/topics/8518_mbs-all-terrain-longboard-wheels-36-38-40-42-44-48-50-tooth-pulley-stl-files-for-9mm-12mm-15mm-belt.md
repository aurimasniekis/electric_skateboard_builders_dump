I did a thing again. I'm too tired to do the whole screen shot and pictures and editing but these are 6mm from the 46mm outer hub ring to wheel instead of 7.65mm that clones and ABEC flywheels are and the back of the cone is 52mm instead of 58mm. You dont have to cut up your MBS wheels to use pulleys now. Enjoy.

Haha, these things are awesome, kudos @JuniorPotato93 !

@E-Boarding what motor pulley are you using with the 50T MBS, and are you happy with the gearing ratio? I am still pondering what T/T pulleys & ratio to go with for these MBS

planning to use 13t : 50t to get top speed of about 32 km/h, this is just calculated, broke my both VESCs, have to wait for new ones before I can test :(
(If speed is to low or belts are slipping, I switch to 14t or 15t motor pulleys, don't know yet)

What size belt do you use for 50T?

305mm with enertion motor mount and 13t motor pulley

but be carefull with 50t you have very less clearance and after a while when the wheel gets smaler, you may need a smaler pulley, 48t should also work with 305mm belts.

@JuniorPotato93 What application are you using for the pulleys? I need to edit your file in order to adapt into my next build.

Sorry for the inconvenience but someone will have a motor pulley to print in 3d 15mm / belt.

Thanks for the great gesture @juniorpotato93 I'll print them 40t (or 44t) in Nylon, tell you later how it goes.

You truly are the master pulley artist. Thank you good sir. 

Question: What size (i.e. length) HTD belt would you use for a 15/40 (15mm) setup?
