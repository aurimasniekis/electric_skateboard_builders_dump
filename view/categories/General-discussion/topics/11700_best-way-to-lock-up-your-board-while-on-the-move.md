I plan on using my board daily to get to school and back. What is the best way to secure your board while you're not by its side? I thought about using a bike chain lock but it's way too easy to simply unscrew the trucks and snatch the board. If i don't find a way, it's not worth me buying it in the first place. That's my situation...

Any ideas?

Thanks,
Cal

Try drilling a wide enough hole on your board to allow for a bike lock to fit through. Ideally for one of those large chain locks. That way if anybody tries to steal your board, they would be required to saw through the board.

note- make sure you don't drill the hole too close to the edge of the board as it could snap while riding

something like this (obviously you will drill a more circular/suitable hole but you get the idea):

What about the Motors, Escs and Lipos?

I would say that a lot of us keep our boards with us at all times. Is there a room like the school reception/office or a friendly electronics teacher that would let you keep your board in their room during school hours?  Otherwise perhaps find a theft proof kids Snowboard bag and then bike lock that?

thats a risk you'll have to convince yourself to take, the only way to completely prevent the board and/or its parts from being stole is to (A) lock it all up in a box, then lock the box with a bike lock or (B) unassemble the board every time you ride haha (obviously both are inconvenient and impractical)

but I would recommend keeping the board with you as often as possible, or ask your teachers to store it during classes (what Luke said)

You know, that's not a terrible idea. In fact, that's a great idea. I could bring a screw driver with me to school, then put the trucks in my school bag, perhaps inside a box to prevent damage. But then i would be left with the VESC and the lipos, two of the most expensive parts.

Edit- nevermind, just forgot that the motor is soldered LOL

What if i bought special screws that come with a special screwdriver, something that a thief wouldn't be able to get his hands on. Though i'm not sure if they even exist

You could use one of these bike alarms. Alarm goes of when someone tries to move it.

On second thought, if i can get one with a remote control to stop the alarm from inside the school, this may be a good idea. It would need to be really freakin loud though. The place where i would keep it locked is about 250 meters away from the school. Ideally as loud as a car alarm..

Actually, just watched this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsiL4tndk3M
This would be great. Thanks for your help.

Why would you wanna stop the alarm from inside the school ? What if it does get stolen ? Don't u wanna go check out u board or chase it ?

You could also put a GPS tracker on it to track it if it does get stolen.

Im thinking of installing a GPS tracker to my board, do you recommend any type in particular? It would be useful if the lightbug tracker was available to purchase

I normally keep my board with me or at work its safe to leave it where ever. When i take the board to school i leave it in my locker because it fits. When i leave it in public (like at a bike rack) i use a d shaped lock and run it through the deck. All my components are screwed down or in a encloser. All scews and bolts have locktite red so have fun with your screw driver. Plus i don't leave it locked up for long.

Is locktite red that strong? I've never used locktite before.

They claim its permeant, but just hit it with a tour h for a sec or two and its loose.

Raptor has a handle on it so I suppose it could be lcked up through that. Or you could put a handle  on your board to enable lockng. Personally I wouldnt leave it out of sight. Though I dont think that many ppl would know if it were an Eboard unless they looked closely. The things are dam heavy, so youd be able to chase them down if soneone tried to carry it away.

Not a crazy idea to tuck one of these in the enclosure. https://www.thetileapp.com

@CRABOLSKY Isn't the range on those like 45 metres since it is bluetooth? Maybe a tracker that is connected via cellular

Oh really? I thought they had a gps chip in them. But now that I think about it there's now way the battery would last even a day if it was talking to a satellite!

You could try putting velcro between the enclosure and the board. When you need to leave the board somewhere lock it up with the holes YusephJ mentioned and then just unplug the motor and remove the enclosure.

I have a tile and its next to useless. If you are more than 30 feet away you cant ring it or locate it. Their is no gps, its based on other users locating it when you mark it as lost.  Would 100% NOT recommend for finding a lost eboard.

can you not just carry it with you everywhere? That why I converted to boarding over biking because I can take my board everywhere and it never leaves my sight

another idea, instead of having everything in an enclosure on the bottom of the board, keep your lipos and VESC in a breifcase with your remote as the cases handle. you'll connect to the motor via 3 long cables. just an idea if you want to protect your batteries and VESC

Yeah i think the best ideas are already discussed here.
To guard the components you either have to:
1) take them off
2) hide them (in a bag)
3) build theft proof / tearproof enclosure

Also additionak devices like gps and alarm are also welcome (relies on other people and tech reliability when tracking the signal if the worst has happened

You'd need to be able to hide it fairly well though, also, a GPS might not work so well if the person decides to take the trucks while the GPS is connected to the board!

if u loose the truck only you are happy.....loosing everything is something to think about..
if you are using some sort of enclosure that is not see through than gps it...
