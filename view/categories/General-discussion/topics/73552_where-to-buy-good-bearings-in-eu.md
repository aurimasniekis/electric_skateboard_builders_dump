Hi! I would need some bearings, do you know where to buy qualitative bearings? I only found SFK or NSK bearings and the ones I need are like 15-20 Euro each!

Thanks guys!

Bearings for what? Your wheels or motors?

Then amazon/any other online marketplace is a good place to start. The site you linked is also a good source.

yeh I need a source where  I can find datasheet ecc. General bearing for a motor is a bit risky.

thanks, I need something in the range of 40-45mm ID x 7 width x 58-62mm OD. Difficult you have them if not for a particular purpose.
SKF easy to find them but 30 Euro each is a lot!

yeh I see like for instance 6809 bearing is good. Probably ZZ to be stainsteel sealed and C3 to have more clearance for temp. Then the price goes up up up :grin:

Yeh with bearing there is always the problem that they can be cheap quality or fake in case of famous brands. That's why I asked here in case someone knows a good quality one but at reasonable price. I will check the one you posted. Thanks!

What bearing do you need? Some bearings are just expensive and you can't avoid that. It just depends on what you choose

I use this website when I design stuff, that way I know that the bearing that my design uses is affordable

Thx. I would need something like 6809 ZZ, possible C3 bearings. 8 found one from the German shop. I asked for the datasheet to see rpm and load.
