I reality all you would need to do to turn this into a beast is switch out the motor, esc and up the voltage ... The rest can stay

3Ah 6S LiPo battery for 63$ is shit... Just get batteries from [HobbyKing](http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/index.asp). I did not found a lower price anywhere else! Maybe someone found a better place to buy LiPos?

Vesc and any of the Turnigy Sk with 190 -260kv will change the game

Edit: but stock is limited for these...I see you asked in another thread about motors.... @chaka has motors available soon that are 170kv and 200kv respectively  

Also you will need to up the voltage .... 

You can go 10s or 12s 

Two 5s lipos for 10s

Or 

Four 3s lipos or Three 4s lipos or two 6s lipos for 12s

@Michaelinvegas  This may not be the place for this but what do you think of this build setup:

Deck: 36" blank bamboo drop through
Truck: caliber 2
Wheels: kegel 80mm
Motor mount: DIY caliber mount
Gears: DIY kegel kit (16/36T ratio)
ESC: DIY VESC
Transmitter: nyko nunchuck plugged into vesc
Battery: not sure need help
Charger : also need help
Motor: either the sk3 or ollinboards (thinking 245 or 200 kV)

Would you recommend I wait for a backordered sk3 or is the ollinboards a good option?
```

I'd run Ollinboards no less tha 8s cause the kv is 200 

Hobby King is always on back order lol

Make sure u play with this calculator to see the effect of kv on top speed ..

Depends on ur budget 

Most use lipos = 2x 5s packs 


Others 18650 DIY 

Or purchase a space cell or tb's battery solution

I was thinking lipos but my battery knowledge is not extensive. What kind of c rating and maph should look for. And should I get multiple lower s batteries and wire them together?
