*- Are you interested in growing the DIY e-board industry?* 
*- Are you a motivated person with an entrepreneurial spirit?*
*- Are you interested in establishing a secondary income stream?*

As it currently stands I don't have anyone reselling enertion products anywhere in the world.. mainly because I didn't structure my business to work that way & mostly because the people who have contacted me so far have never backed up their intentions with actions. This is probably also due to the fact that I didn't have any framework in place for people to understand how they might proceed.

Since the state of California has now made electric skateboards legal this industry will begin to rapidly grow. More & More people will want high performance, custom made eboards to make their daily movements more efficient. The DIY electric skateboard will eventually become the normal way people acquire an electric skateboard. Of course people will still buy the pre-built in-a-box options but eventually people will realise they can get a better product with better performance if they have it custom made to suit their individual needs. Just like now, if you are enthusiastic about skateboards you buy parts and make your own skateboard, with the deck you like & wheels you like. Eboards will be exactly the same.

The enertion brand is going from strength to strength and I have been focusing all of my attention towards making reliable & professional grade components that have really low failure rates. I think people can see this in our products and they now associate the enertion brand with quality. But not everyone has the skills to build their own rig and there are many people who simply don't want to order parts from across the other side of the globe and risk the problem of not being able to build the board when they get the parts. 

So I have been thinking of ways to enable a B2B cooperation with keen builders across the globe. After careful consideration I think there are three steps to getting involved with the enertion brand if you are serious about making some cash doing what you love.

**》STAGE1. Become an "Enertion Certified Eboard Builder"**. Someone who builds custom-made boards for my website customers. Example. Someone in the states buys gear from me and then can't work out how to install it. So they go to you and pay a "build fee" based on the hours of work you do.

This is the starting point if you are interested in becoming involved with enertion, as there is little risk or financial investment on your behalf. It's also probably a good way to see how things naturally evolve. You can learn what products you like best and become more knowledgeable at a steady pace. But you don't make money from selling my products and I'm still offering the customer the support & warranty. You just build boards for people and charge them an hourly rate.

IMPORTANT: To become certified you need to build an electric skateboard for yourself... using mostly enertion parts. It needs to be a quality build! You need to document the build process and create a build thread here: www.electric-skateboard.builders showing your handy work. I will use the build thread to evaluate your skillz & if I like what I see I will certify you as an official "enertion eboard builder" I will promote you and your business on our website which gets well over 20K of hits per month from people looking to buy/make an eboard. I'll also email our customer base advertising your services.

Being an Enertion Certified Builder you are also expected to get involved with the community here at www.electric-skateboard.builders and help people with the questions they post... which turns out to be a great way to promote your services to people who run into problems.

**》STAGE 2. Become an "Enertion Certified Builder & Reseller"** This is when a customer wants you to do the whole build for them. You buy the parts from me after they have paid you a deposit. The customer is yours and they don't buy anything directly from me. You now offer the support directly to the customer. You communicate with me if there are problems. I give you a discount code so you make some profit on the parts you resell & you also charge a build fee based on the hours you spent.

This option has minimal risk also. It is also probably better for the customer as they deal with a local expert from start to finish to get the build they want. You become a one-stop-shop. But you can't do this if you don't prove yourself with option one first. I would also start advertising you as a "Enertion Certified Builder & Parts Reseller" on a special page on my website which will generate lots of leads. Now it's up to you to see if you can build some really nice boards and build a reputation. If you can't succeed at Option 1. Option 2 is not a good idea.

**》STAGE 3. You are a "Certified Enertion Stockists".** You have most things in stock ready to sell or use in customer builds etc. You must buy parts in bulk from Enertion as there are minimum order quantities set by me. Your profit margin scales up with your order size, the more gear you sell the more profits you can make. This option is available if you are successful with option 2. There is more money to be made for you and more risk. As I like to say..You need to put your money where you mouth is!

NOTE: To reach level 3 you must progress through each stage starting from level 1.

No, this is for anyone interested.... At this stage I don't have any intention on offering custom made builds for people in australia, i simply don't have the resources to do that... However eventually i will limit the destinations so that each certified person doesn't have to compete with each other... you don't want someone popping up next door trying to undercut you. It all depends on population density & demand.. But that will take few years before that happens. First in best dressed!

I've got at least 5 people who really want me to build them a board.. I've just been to lazy, but maybe I'll actually think about following through with their request.

At this point I'm also assuming you don't want a 16 year old building board's for your customers, but would there be a way to get a slight discount if I were ordering multiple full setups (like propulsion kit, motor, vesc, etc) to build board's for people I know personally?

I totally understand if that's undoable, but I was just wondering.

It's cool to see how far you've come with the whole business!

I am very interested. I am still new to building electric skateboards but have lots of experience with electronics through my robotics team. Its funny because I was thinking when I get some more experience building electric skateboards I would get into distributing them due to the interest people have taken to my board. So I got real excited when I saw this post. Anyway I would love to be a part in the growing electric skateboard industry. It is truely exoting. I will post a build thread when I finalize my board. I agree with cmatson if you don't want high school students distributing your product I understand. 

Thanks Hans

@locktight  @cmatson age has nothing to do with this.

To qualify for Level 1 & Become a Certified Enertion Builder all you need to do is demonstrate you can build a quality eboard. You basically just need to buy some enertion parts and build a board. The minimum of parts would be.

1. Space Cell
2. VESC
3. Motor Mounts
4. R-SPEC Motors

Use whatever deck you want. Caliber trucks is ok, ABEC 11 Flywheels is ok.

@cmatson... technically you have already 90% qualified. I suppose I need to see your final build, I know you're nearly finished!

Then I can refer customers to you who need help to build their boards, i'll use a link to your build thread so customers can see your skillz, it's then up to you to convince them (if they contact you) that you can build something to their liking and get them to pay you for your time.

HOT TIP: make a really awesome board, take really good photos and make a really nicely thought out build thread demonstrating your process and showcasing your results - your build thread becomes an Advertisement of your building skillz. I would also suggest you come up with a Business Name that is unique and memorable. Maybe gets some stickers made up to put on each build you do. Then you can keep adding photos of your customers builds to your build thread to further showcase your work.

So basically it's your business, I'm just sending you clients looking for someone to complete their build using enertion parts.

You can continue to make enclosures, In fact i will recommend people use your ABS vacuum formed products to ensure the components are well protected. It makes the board look heaps better too.

Eventually i will have an enclosure too, but it will be different to what you're doing. Probably carbon fiber.

I'd love to make another e-board to expand my knowledge. But first I need to work more at my dad's company and maybe get a bit older. At my age the only problem is that my friends love the idea of an eboard but they don't have the money to make one. Would love to join in the future though. Good luck with the business!

I am making good progress with a full Enertion board project. On the mechanics side everything was simple, I put that down to ample Lego/Meccano experience as a child. On the electronics side I have made more progress after investing time, effort and cash into a soldering crash course and getting the right equipment.

My original plan was to get this project finished before the end of the summer (in Switzerland) and cruise around with a few business cards in my pocket to hand out should I get any interest. VESC & logistics delays means that the plan has been delayed overall but I still think I should be ready in a month or so. My plan is then to try and promote it as a lux (=expensive) Christmas present to be delivered by Spring. No one is going to be boarding here while there is snow and ice on the ground!!.

There is a big market here for rich boyz toyz (too many bankers!!), so potential for EBoards too I think. I'd be interested in being involved but would want to represent Enertion in a geographical area that included at least the whole of Switzerland on an exclusive basis. Interested?

```
the plan is to have a certified enertion builder in every country (and eventually every state/region)

Someone on the ground that can help people with importing parts, building there boards and getting service done.

Just like a bike needs to be "serviced" I also think eboards need a tune up every now & then. 
1. Replacing belts.
2. Wheels & bearing replacement.
3. Firmware upgrades.
4. Battery replacement.
5. General tuning.

And most importantly sales & support. 

This stuff might seem simple to most of us. But in the future there will be people riding skateboards who don't know anything about building one or how the work.

```
will this mean that there might eventually be US distribution? (and other countries of course)

Also, I agree with the serviced idea, with one thing to add:
maybe rather than just having one head guy for every region/country, you also have a list of minor people who can help with the smaller stuff. For example, if you have a list of people that you have "certified" to be able to replace peoples' belts, wheels, bearings, etc, I think it could make the overall system even more fluid. 

A guy in florida might not want to have his board shipped to California because of a broken belt that he can't figure out how to replace(lets just say your head rep is there for an example) when there is a local guy who can replace the belt in 5 minutes. Bigger things like battery replacement and sales can be left for the head guy, but I think his job would be a lot easier with the local guys helping out here and there.

Just a minor suggestion! it could be as simple as a list on your website of all your "minor" certified builders with their city location and email.

I think the 3 levels that I defined sort of achieve what your saying.

Some people with more time money and motivation will naturally filter through and become larger, they may also start supplying to the smaller guys who might be in the local area. (That's probably a few years away though)

Some of the small guys might end up having such a great reputation they expand beyond their original goals.

We won't know until we give it a go!

I think it needs to be clearly reiterated that each individual can make this what they want it to be.

I am simply putting down a basic framework so people can map out what they want to achieve.

I will be here to help, offer guidence, help develop import strategies- of course I need to make sure I am offering support to everyone and everyone is supporting me back.. But i think the most successful people are the ones who carve out their own niche. 

They will tell me what they want/need to grow and it is for me to work hard to make it happen.

For the younger guys who want to get involved in spare time after school and on the weekends that's perfectly ok. You must clearly define your abilities and what you can offer to the customers. You might only have the capacity to serve a 15km area. So that's what you focus on.

This concept of distribution will evolve naturally as the market requires it to. I am prepared to be flexible and adaptive to local needs in each country.

The most important thing is that it is builders of eboards that are the leaders of the industry. WE certainly don't want a bunch of suits involved that are NOT on the ground working with the people. 

The major goals are;
1. Customers get a better deal, better service & better builds.
2. Builders of eboards get some bonus income.
3. Enertion sales increase, I can improve my offerings. Economy of scale.

This industry needs to be nutured and carefully developed over several years. Let's take it step by step.

I'm interested in all of these options. I'm in the process of setting up a store for bits and pieces such as belts, bolts, wires, adapters, and volt meters, as well as my own custom eboard decks with matching boxes. This past weekend I set up a development site for the shop as well as my blog. The mold i had CNC'd for my decks will be arriving this week. I was planning to also sell custom completes using enertion equipment anyway, so this would be a bonus. I'm still a little ways out from opening for business and  still trying to work everything out. Setting up shop is hard!

COOL... I thought you'd be interested. Setting everything up is a big job. Actually it is a job that never finishes... there will always be more things that can be done/improved. 

So somtimes the best thing you can do is dive in and start...

When i first started selling just mounts, I had my website setup with products using images that where all just digital renders. I was selling stuff before I got the stock. It's risky but once you have people who paid you for something it's a huge motivation to deliver in a timely manner. 

If you wait for everything to be perfect before you secure your first sale you could be waiting a long time ;)

I sent you an email before you went on holiday asking specifically for something like that. I'm glad that it's now a possibility.
Can you please let us know:
- Where/how do you register for the scheme?
- I'm assuming the partner discount will be available to order parts for the reference build once you've validated the application? (As is usually the case in this sort of partnership agreement)
- It would be great to have a generic contract drafted just so that we're clear on terms and conditions around warranty, returns, etc (including timescales).

Hey mate... sorry if i missed your email bit crazy at Enertion HQ last few weeks.. 

So It's not really a scheme and you don't need to register per se.

**This is about individuals putting up their hand saying "I build eboards"**

If you can display your eboard building skills using enertion parts by making a build thread showcasing what you built, that is all you need to do.

Achieving LEVEL #1 is technically a vetting process for me. You show your commitment by doing a build with my parts and making a build thread. This shows me your are a serious person wanting to give it a go! Simply make it known you want to build boards for people by writing something in your build thread like:

> Do you like my build? If you want me to build you something similar message me

*Basically if you don't build an enertion eboard to show your ability, you don't get certified, which means i don't advertise you or list you on my website, However even if you are not enertion Certified doesn't mean you cant still say you will build eboards for people, i just wont be sending customers to you.*

So once you post the BT ill review it! & if its well thought out and looks professional your AUTOMATICALLY CERTIFIED & I'll list you on my website as a certified builder.. and direct customers to you who want boards built.

Where you take it from there is up to you. There really is no need for a contract or terms and conditions at this stage. As this evolves I will document any necessary information.

**The one thing that ill say is to progress through each level from #1, #2 & #3 there will be some milestones that must be achieved. So to go from level 1 to level 2 you need to build 5 customer boards and post them into your build thread. Once again this shows me you are serious, I don't want time wasters, I want people that have proved they are committed. Afterwards then you get the discounts and can start buying discounted parts to do all future builds with. Also the more deals you do the more your discounts increase, eventually you end up at Level #3 and you are stocking parts & buying bulk at the maximum discount levels..** 

If you have specific questions use this thread to ask/discuss so we can all work together to make this a win-win for all involved.

Don't get me wrong, it makes total sense for you to gauge individuals before giving them more privileges. But as a business owner myself, it makes equal sense to take guarantees and ensure we've agreed how we're going to handle various situations. 

Here's what I can do for you: use my existing UK ltd company to create a distribution centre and a web presence selling your products from the UK and covering most of Western Europe. I have some experience in eCommerce and in distribution/reselling programs in the IT hardware industry.

The problem is that a loose agreement like the one you describe raises some questions, for instance:

 - If customers return products under warranty, can I swap out their part once I've confirmed the fault and return the faulty unit to you?
 - You're building quite a lot of brand equity in "Enertion", to what extent are you willing to let us use it to market your products? Is my business at risk if you verbally agree a certain type of use but then realise that it creates a problem for you later. I'm potentially exposed to litigation without the means of proving that I had your approval.

Bottom line is, I'm wondering whether you'd entertain the idea of a more robust relationship within a distribution agreement framework. It looks like what I'm asking is a little different to what you have in mind. If you're interested, we can discuss terms for an option #4. Possibly offline if you prefer.

*By the way, if you use Google Analytics on your platform, I'd be interested to know if you've had any sales attributed to a campaign called "EvanAndDad". This would be people like LockTight who found your site through a video we've made.*

@EvanAndDadProd

I 100% agree with what your saying. To be honest, the reason there isn't a level #4 with official terms of trade defined is i haven't had time to think it through. 

In a way this current model was targeting the hobbyist/enthusiast looking to earn a bit of extra cash. 

I will confirm that I have been talking to a few other individuals who want to establish a more formal agreement. Lets call it; Level #4. However it is something that needs careful consideration.

At level #4 Both parties will be investing lots of time, money & effort setting up businesses and systems to enable growth and to ensure a high level of support can be delivered to customers all over the world. There is much more risk so we both need some assurances in place. I'm fully with you in that regard.

Basically I need to draft a letter highlighting what you can and cannot do with my products and brand, what warranty you get and what price you can buy parts for. 

This will take time. If you like you can email jason@enertionboards.com some case studies of other similar and successful agreements and we can borrow some ideas and build this up to be somthing that is fair and reasonable for both parties. 

Also I am very interested in learning more about the evolve business model. It's seems to be working rather well.

Please don't hesitate to contact us for further assistance.

Kind regards Jason.

@onloop just an throwing out an idea, but a good way i have seen to get people to advertise your product is you could give people who purchase your products discount codes and if they tell someone about it they can give them their code to use for a discount. if someone uses your code you could get a certain percent off your next order, credit for enertion products or some other form of incentive. this way it encourages people to advertise your brand for you.

@locktight this is essentially how an affiliate marketing system works.

It's great for people who want to be brand ambassadors and spread the word about enertion online. People who have blogs or who are very active in online communities & social networks are best setup to take advantage of this type of partnership.

With this option there is no building involved (but you could also do that as well). You can start by simply writing an article or review about Enertion's products on your blog, include a link to purchase. You can then earn some commission if the referred customer makes a purchase.

I am looking into this as I think it is a great way of becoming involved with the enertion journey without getting your hands dirty in the work shop.

Also, It could actually be an effective way for certified builders at level #1 to earn additional revenue from the customers who contract them to build the custom made eboard.

These system are very much software dependent. Finding the best affiliate marketing software is critical to build a robust and easy to use system.

Commission is normally around 4-10%.

I wonder about the difference between selling components to hobbyists more or less under the radar and selling complete configurations with the subsequent need to comply with regulations such as CE, FCC certification and whatnot. 
I know for a fact that you cannot market anything in the EU without a CE certificate, which implies risk analyses, validations and a lot of yada yada yada. 
And what about liability ? What if some poor soul burns down his/her house and the cause was a short in a SPACE cell that hasn't passed any certificatons ?
Or if some idiot drives his/her board into traffic, ends up a paraplegic and decides to sue the builder for not correctly informing him/her of the dangers/risks ? Not so far fetched in the US.

I'm not meaning to criticize anything here, just thinking out loud and inviting other's opinions.

That's a good question. I think the individual listings on the components covers that though, right? 

Mine are more boutique, but the raptors are more assembly line. I have no idea if scale of production even plays into it. 

I'm in the process of acquiring liability insurance as well as a proper LLC so i guess that's another thing to add to the list.

Not to discourage anyone, but this is the exact reason I don't like to sell completes. I have first hand experience with being sued. I will discuss via pm. Not public.

I'm not familiar with US regulations but I am very familiar with the EU ones so I'll shed a little light on that topic.

In the EU, in theory all components sold separately need to be individually CE labeled, which basically means they have passed a review to verify they comply with EU regulations. I just checked a few parts from Hobbyking in my spares box and all of them are CE labeled, because they came from the EU warehouse.
Now, even though each individual component is CE labeled and compliant, I can easily build a dangerous and non-compliant assembly that could hurt/kill/poison people, damage property etc.
So if you're selling assemblies in the EU, your assembly needs to pass CE validation as a whole, and *that* is even more complex than for individual components. You'll need a risk analysis, all relevant design data, and you'll need to make a user manual in the user's own language, with a plethora of disclaimers. And it costs €.
Long story short: if you sell assemblies in the EU they must comply to reg's or you're liable as hell.

i'm going straight to the horse's mouth. I just submitted a request to UL so we're all going to find out what's what as soon as i hear back from them.  All of my other processes have been public and transparent, so why not this too? Its kind of important.

@longhairedboy @trbt555 @psychotiller and anyone else interested in being a seller of completes; I used to own a small bicycle shop in the US, I ran it out of my apartment. I had to carry insurance in case someone took a repair from me and then got hit by a car. Even if an accident isn't "your fault" in the US it's common to get sued if there is even a weak case that your device\product was related. It can escalate very quickly and destroy your financial life. It's unfortunate that this is the case, but it is still true. @onloop I suggest that you require proof of insurance for a business before you allow resellers to sell completes in the US. That's what all bicycle wholesellers do here.

that's actually a solid idea. I've been shopping for liability insurance for a while and haven't been able to get anywhere with it, people either won't return my emails/calls at all or they drop me in mid conversation. An LLC will protect your personal assets from those kinds of suits though. But if i can't nail down liability insurance very soon, i'm probably going to have to suspend listing my own completes. 

Also, i'm curious about how much liability can be shifted to the customer if these boards are shipped "some assembly required", meaning shipped in a non-complete, non-rideable state. It would be trivial (for my builds anyway) to have the deck, front trucks, and rear trucks as separate items that have to be bolted together, then plug in three or  six labelled wires and you're good to go. 

I'd rather not step back and only do DIY parts and pieces, but i will if i can't get some clear answers on this stuff. I may have to pay for a consultation or something. blech.

Selling a complete eboard can make you more liable  for any injury that occurs. But it's more to do with wether the product you sold was to blame for the injury. If you sell a kit that fails and it can be proven that the parts in the kit are to blame for the injury that occurs you are equally liable. So it's more to do with how good your product is an wether you can prove it was or was not related to the product.

Liability can also be judged on the training, information and instructions you provide. Thats why every product you buy has warnings printed in the instructions manual. Have a look a any kitchen appliance instruction booklets to see the common warnings about death, poisoning and electrocution.

You can also limit your liability by getting the customer to sign a document that clearly lists the dangers and risks. That's why when you sign up at any gym they make you sign something saying you could die.

When looking for insurance I suggest looking for insurance brokers and tell them what you want. They will find the insurer for you. 

The other thing you might consider is forming a company, the company is its own entity and this will seperate your personal assets from any legal matters that might arise do to an injury claim.

Hot tips
1. Write a small list of the risk involved with using the product. Get customer to sign it 
2. Call an insurance broker and get liability insurance.
3. Make some instructional video/documents  showing how to use the saftey features. The brakes. Wearing helmets. Wear protective clothing.
4. Form a company.


For all certified enertion builders you will get access to these documents and instructional videos etc.

Hi I was very intrigued by this post, I am currently in the process of building an eboard with VESC, Enertion Motor Mounts, and R-SPEC Motors, but am not using a the SPACE Cell battery, I am getting a custom battery; 36V 10Ah with battery indicator and reliable on and off switch. Would I still be able to complete the first step and become an Enertion Certified Eboard Builder? I am very interested in this and think that the Eastern United States would be a great addition for you!

If not thank you very much for your time!
Jared

I am interested for the NYC area market. I have two companies both fully insured (not cheap around here), one may be a good fit. Just have to check with my broker about reselling parts or completes.
