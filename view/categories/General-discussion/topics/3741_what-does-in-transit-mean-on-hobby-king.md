You need to ask them. It could be that the product your purchasing is currently out of stock and it would take sometime to get them shipped. Happens to me alot.

In transit is what hobbyking puts when they have ordered something from a supplier and are waiting for stock to arive at the warehouse. Basically, they are selling what is headed to the warehouse.

As for which motor it is, Obviously the origingal poster is trying to hide which model motor it is so that no one scoops it out from him XD

Its this motor here

@longhairedboy, I can sell this kit to you for a dealer price, then you can mark it up as your kit.

Or take your deck and make it a GIANT switch blade knife.
