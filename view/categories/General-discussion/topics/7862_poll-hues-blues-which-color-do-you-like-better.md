If the trucks were the same colour, I would go with dark blue.

The choice I would pick isn't there. No matter to me. Mine is getting a few coats of heavy duty easy off and some polishing paste.

*edit* voted dark blue

I kind of like the color of the light blue one, but I like the matte finish of the dark blue one more, so dark blue wins out for me.
