I do have to admit, the deck looks pretty clean. But, we'll never know until it's tested.

Man, why would they make such an ugly longboard.  Geez, you would think with all that money they pump into design, they would have come up with something that looks a little nicer.  Maybe its just me but that thing look horrendous.

I associate Lexus and their brand with the "luxury" crowd; the antithesis of long boarding and skating in my view :)

It looks good!  Some interesting styling with the mini fish tail and what are those, aluminum grab plates or something?

Indeed they are. Should've just gotten the fellow who makes these to make their deck, he works for toyota's F1 team...

They are trying to target the younger demographic with their F-Sport line. That's the only thing i can think

 Since when is 211â‚¬ expensive for a complete Board? My Carbon fiber deck did cost 300â‚¬ for just the blank deck without tape!

This deck costs 199 euros ($211) and is available now from the automakerâ€™s dealers in Germany.

I'm reading it as the deck costs 211. Maybe I'm interpreting it wrong.

i like the design too. 
But i think you can get a similar board cheaper. You pay a lot for the name ;)
