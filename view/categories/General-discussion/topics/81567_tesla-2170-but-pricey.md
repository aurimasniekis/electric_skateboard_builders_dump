Well its finnally happened. 

Super tempted to buy 1 for science. Id really like to know how good these are. I still havent seen any hit the wild yet.and i have been on the hunt.   Only a few full batteries

Seems expensive and its just prob a normal 21700 cell lol :rofl:

Id agree its ebay. Prob fake but id really like to see these finnaly turn up. 

Apprarently tesla uses a tight glue that makes it super diff to take apart at a cell level

Batteries designed for electric vehicles are unlikely to be optimised for eskate use. They want much higher energy density and don't need the power density. Consider a 30Q. 3Ah and 15A rated continuous (5C). The Tesla P100D. with 100kWh doesn't need 500kW continously. So they tweak the cells for capacity rather than power (edit).

eh? capacity = range does it not
you mean they tweak for capacity not power output..?

Neither do we, a cell used in a Tesla is perfectly fine for our case, ideal I would say, they take huge burst of current great and still have a big capacity

The Tesla cells are a custom high discharge cell designed between Tesla and Panasonic , built by Panasonic at the Tesla Gigafactory.

Hmm if there was a cell so good why not release it, because their cell isdnt a game changer, Tesla optimizes their cells for capacity

Buuuut. A reliable 2170 with 5ooo mah at 15 amp price depending would > 30q.

For us rangist.

It's all about the cobalt.  They need it all for themselves.

There's probably plenty of cobalt around the world. Just not many established mines yet. 
This is about to change though.

About 3,5 $ per 21700 cell. 
Good for doing what @mynamesmatt had in mind.
Lets say that someone buys it disassembles and then resells cells at 4,5$ for forum members. I would be interested.
About 1000 cells will find its owners within this forum il less than year at this price.

You sometimes see real Tesla packs being taken apart on endless sphere, I would keep an eye out there rather than eBay

On snaps. I missed that in ebay. Theres a full batt too. 

If these are selling  its only a matter of time till someone sucks it up to sell the cells.

These cells are probably 10 amps continuous considering used one in the Model S before recent updates.

2170's should offer an increase in cell capacity. That is: 21mm wide x 70mm tall. That's 3mm wider and 5mm taller than the previous 18650 cells used by Tesla in the past, but now, that size increment translates in 15% more energy density than in previous cells. This will translate in an increment of energy storage and at the same time a significant battery weight reduction with an improvement up to 40% efficiency in some cases, depending on the type of electric motor (kWh) Tesla will use.

According to Tesla:

> “Cells used in Model 3 are the highest energy density cells used in any electric vehicle. We have achieved this by significantly reducing cobalt content per battery pack while increasing nickel content and still maintaining superior thermal stability. The cobalt content of our Nickel-Cobalt-Aluminum cathode chemistry is already lower than next-generation cathodes that will be made by other cell producers with a Nickel-Manganese-Cobalt ratio of 8:1:1.”

There is future in Cobalt mining then! I remember during the old days of printed Photography and dark rooms, Kodak used like 85% of all the Silver produced in the world for their photo paper emulsion! It was insane. They were the largest consumer of Silver in the planet.

Now that a grrrreeat idea! Will be awesome if we could conform a group buy for this purpose. :yum::+1:

Looking forward when they manage to cut cobalt completely, luckily in the next iteration of the cells

Cobalt isn't the future. Cobalt production is a byproduct of copper and nickel ores. And it's mined in Africa using partly child labor with labor practices considered questionable.
