I've been lurking for awhile and started planning my build over the last few weeks. Any project I do always starts off as a spredsheet and I thought I'd share the [final product](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LaLQ8KkxJ-Qdk7Ale1DMewKdeQdmgHqYSS1uMPSX-5Q/edit#gid=0)

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LaLQ8KkxJ-Qdk7Ale1DMewKdeQdmgHqYSS1uMPSX-5Q/edit#gid=0

The sheet includes parts, prices, links, and top speed. The math was taken from http://calc.esk8.it/ which was inspired by http://toddy616.blogspot.ca/2013/07/electric-skateboard-calculator.html?m=1

I've opened it up the public so feel free to throw your plans on a new tab to copy the sheet and roll your own. 

Enjoy. *edit added embed thanks to @Jinra

Looks good so far :) Added my notes in the suggestions box. Feel free to look over my sheet if you're interested. It's slightly outdated.

You forgot an enclosure and connectors. Also the cost/mph calculation is wrong.
