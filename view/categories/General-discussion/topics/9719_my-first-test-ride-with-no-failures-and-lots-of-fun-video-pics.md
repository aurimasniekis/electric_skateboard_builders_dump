Hi Everyone,

I finally had a test ride with absolutely no failures.

My setup is :

* APS 3.2kw 240kv 6374
* 9mm HTD5 belt
* 2 x 3s 5000mah Zippy Compact
* VESC
* HM-10 bluetooth
* Turning 9XR remote for now
* 3D print mount, gears

I rode it around 5km, my batteries were 11.9v each at the end (Correction: Batteries weren't full in beginning I just noticed). My gears and belt tension is not perfect yet. Also I had to stop and start a lot because I rode it city.

Yesterday, I had a scary near-accident though. It was my stupid mistake. I used VESC Android App for actual ride, although it is not advised for real driving use.
It got out of control going full speed, luckily I jumped off while it was still slow. It hit to a wall, broke gears and stopped.

I used a quadcopter controller remote for a while too originally... so bad, uncomfortable, and not portable.
