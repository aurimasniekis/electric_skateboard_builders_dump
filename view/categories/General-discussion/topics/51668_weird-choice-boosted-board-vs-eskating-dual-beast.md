I want to buy an electric board and have narrowed it down to these boards:

Boosted board V2 Dual+ with the extended range battery and Eskating.eu dual beast (link for those not familiar https://eskating.eu/product/eskating-dual-beast-landy-evo-7020watts-10s4p-30q-fully-assembled/) with a 10s4p battery.

I know that these boards are completely different The boosted board is a polished product that is lightweight, reliable, best remote and has decent performance but it also has a short range (even with the extended range battery) and I would prefer bigger wheels. The dual beast has more power, looks almost like a finished product (compared to other diy boards) and seems to be made from quality parts. I like the fact that should a part fail in the future I am not tied to a specific brand to procure spare parts as in the case of the boosted board and I can also program the escs to my liking. Finally the seller is in Italy and since I am in Greece (both EU countries)it makes shipping etc simpler. The biggest con is the weight which is 11kg with the 10s battery (and 12kg with the 12s5p) almost twice the weight of the boosted board.

I have also considered other boards such as the evolve GTX but it seems to have reliability problems with the remote and the battery seems not to last as much. Finally it uses proprietary parts like the boosted board.

Can you guys help me choose? Does any of you have experience with the eskating dual beast or its components? Final cost for both boards including shipping, taxes etc is 1500€ .

Finally another question. The boosted board has a 200Whr battery and the Evolve GT a 234Whr battery. The boosted board claims a range of 12 miles whereas the evolve gt 21 miles. I honestly can't see how such a difference is possible (considering the boasted board uses less powerful motors) unless Evolve runs the battery down to lower voltages which is never good for a LiPo or any type of Li-Ion cell.

Get the Dual Beast from Alberto!
It´s heavier because of a much bigger battery and much more power than the other boards, also bigger wheels weight more ;)
Also if you have any questions or problems @fottaz is directly there for you ;)

Get the Beast :slight_smile:

Evolvs 21 miles are bullshit :) with 234 Wh you would get like 20 km:) 

Simple question: what do you want from your board? Do you want short distance commuter to travel to store and back, recharge, to work and back, recharge, to school and back? 

Or do you want beast that can conquer any hill, push a car or two, run to work to home to store and back again on single charge and still have 60% of battery left? :O 

Both of them are made around really nice and comfortable deck, both are made of quality parts...

In case something goes wrong and your board will stop working, it will be much easier to repair the Eskating beast than sending bosoted somewhere (IDK if they have reapairer in europe yet)...

I would go for the beast :) The only ting I would change are the 97mm clone wheels :( ABEC11 75a would be the way to go :)

You'd have to have a very specific use case to go for the 'boosted' board. If you fly very frequently and have to have a light board then maybe, just maybe you could justify it.

The Evo on the other hand... It's better in every other regard. The battery alone has over 6x the fucking capacity! Idk what debate there is to have ;)

Wow, instant responses.Thanks guys.
My commute to work is 10km but I intend on using the board for fun also. Most of the times I have to take my car since I need to get out of the office mid day to go to a client and some other times I use my Brompton.
20km round trip means I will have to pack the charger if I get the boosted board.
I really like the dual beast, the only thing that holds me back is the weight which is even heavier than my Brompton. Of course battery capacity comes with a weight penalty as was stated.
So far it seems the beast is ahead in the race.
Keep your opinions coming.

Having similar thoughts...

I do love my Trampa. It's performance exceeds my current ability by a fair margin, and with the ABEC 107s it'll even tackle riding over short grass pretty well. Probably get 20-25km out of a charge. However, I rode it to the tram stop one day and carried it in on a tram for the rest of the way, _this felt like a lot of hard work_. At 12kg it's a lot to lug around.

Not that I'd go for the boosted... Subconsciously I believe I'm using this to justify board no2, a lightweight DIY.

I put in a few additional parts such as: a set of replacement belts, a set of 100mm AT wheels to try in addition to the 97mm ABEC clones on the board, an extra fast charger, handle etc.
Now for the long wait till it comes.

@taz Thanks for making this thread. It's been very useful for me as I'm close to pulling the trigger on the Evo but can't decide on battery - which battery size did you go for? and which remote? 

I think the 10S4P will be enough for me but I think that if I'm spending that much, may as well go all out for the 12S5P.

Tbh, I'd jump at a pre-built single motor landyachtz evo with a 10S4P under 1000EUR. Would be perfect for me as a beginner but the current price difference makes sense to go for the dual-motor kit. Probably huge overkill haha :)

I went for the 10s4p. The range and performance are already more than enough for me.
The 12s5p would only increase cost and weight, without me needing or wanting the additional performance and range.
I went with the eskating (maytech) remote, I hope I made a good choice.
This is my first eskate but I used to skateboard when I was young and I am familiar with all the batteries and electronics since I am also into RC models.

Whaaat @taz ?? Are you kidding me??  Alberto's Dual Beast all day, baby!

![image|500x500](upload://qXcbzIG7ntMw8Kps5a9T5nB4Zck.jpg)

Most esk8 companies should be like his. He is in far away Italy but his products appear at your door like they were comming from around the corner. Best fast shippment and product quality I've seen in all esk8 world. I will buy anything from [Eskating](https://eskating.eu/) with my eyes close. :+1:

Now I have a few questions. 

1. WTF have I gotten myself into? Are you guys fucking insane? This was one of the scariest experiences of my life and I have done some weird shit. People are riding these things without a helmet?
2. How the hell am I supposed to stop this thing if the brakes fail? I know how to slide a skateboard but this is not happening with 97mm soft wheels. Don't tell me foot braking because by the time I reduce my speed I will be posing as a hood ornament in some chick's SUV.
3. What is that odor that comes off my pants and underwear and how do I get rid of it?

Seriously though it looks like they are really fun once you get used to them. I thought that since I am comfortable on my skateboard a big eskate would be easier. This is not the case.

I will write some more when I get that brown thing off my clothes. I don't know how it got there since I did not see any mud while comfortably cruising around 🤔

Yep, that's it.  But with practice, it's usable.  I can foot break from 20mph in about 50 ft.  You can always roll out, but that hurts and you look like a twerp 😀.

Thanks guys. It feels really reassuring to know I am not alone in the madness 😜.

I have a couple more questions:
1. I got speed wobbles above a certain speed, I was relaxed and had my weight forward but it seemed strange to get these on an Evo board when I don't even get them on my normal skateboard close to these speeds. Unfortunately I have no way of knowing what speed that was since (see question 2) 
2. My metr.at  app fails to connect to the Bluetooth module, I read about incompatibility with some phones running Oreo 8. I have a Samsung Note 8, is it one of the affected phones and if yes is there a solution?

You can dewedge the rear truck and look into different bushings catered to your weight and riding style. 
Bushings: Riptide!

Venom bushings also have a really good rep

As for wobbles, I always try to get lower to the deck and constantly carve a little (so you move like a snake). These seem to be popular advices to avoid the wobbles.

I think its essential to learn this, after not foot breaking in years I've spent months using only my foot and feel safe at 30mph knowing I can foot break slow enough to run or roll if I had too, its really helped my confidence at speed no more 'omg I'm going to die if my breaks fail right now'  :)

So I have made 20km with the board so far. 10km was this morning coming to work with a backpack.
I definitely need to make changes on the bushings on the board since with the stock bushing it turns like a boat. I have ordered riptide 83A, 88A and 93A WFB barrel bushings to play with.
As per Alphamail's advice and my own findings I need to loosen up the front and stiffen the rear.
The range on that thing is insane, after 20km my battery is at 87% :dizzy_face: (granted most of the way to work is downhill)

They have a good rep for being inconsistent in their quality control. Sometimes you buy them and get really good bushings with extreme amounts of rebound. Other times you buy them and get bushings with below average rebound. If you want consistency, just get RipTide KranK bushings.

[/quote]

Getting lower to the ground in itself doesn’t help with preventing speed wobbles. The side-effect of getting lower to the ground is that **it forces you to place more weight on your front foot.** That’s the actual bit of advice. Put more weight on the front of the board instead of the back.

Just google for speed wobbles - you actually find a lot of youtube tutorials on this. Mostly for "normal" downhill skating, but everything also applies to esk8. Maybe it helps

Thanks. I used to skateboard when I was younger and still do from time to time so I am familiar with speed wobbles.
This deck is completely different from a normal skateboard and the fact it is powered makes matters different. For example when I release the throttle at over 30km/h (around 19mph) I get speed wobbles no matter how gentle I am with it.
Anyway I am sure one part is the board setup and another myself. So I have ordered bushings to cover the first and will do lots of riding to get more familiar and comfortable with it.

Another update.
I crashed 😜 due to speed wobbles.
The visor of my helmet is scratched (no other damage on the helmet after thorough inspection)
I also ripped a little my motorcycle jacket and have road rash on the right side of my lower back (still can't figure out how that happened 🤔)
![20180615_192357|666x500](upload://7PAFdWX07s71mpoR0EMnZixGaLr.jpg)

The speed was around 25km/h so too low to even justify the wobbles, so when I got home I inspected the board carefully and found out the following.

The board has 2 sets of angled riser pads one of which is from a soft rubbery material. 

![20180615_192436|666x500](upload://rfjQH5YuB3LhjbejmBuC9u1scoB.jpg)

![20180615_192422|666x500](upload://4mrjL2CFUfWRSkTLrfHDVY2B6QW.jpg)
The trucks where not tight enough on the board and the whole baseplate was moving aroung making the board extremely unstable.
I tightened down the baseplates on the board and went for a quick spin and it was night and day difference. The photos are after tightening down the baseplates.
Unfortunately the roads where I did the test did not allow for a proper evaluation (hills with bad quality tarmac) but the first impression is very positive. Still there is a lot of tuning to be made.
