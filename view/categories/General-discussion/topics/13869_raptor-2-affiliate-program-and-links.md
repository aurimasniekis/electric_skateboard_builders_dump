Hey, since the Raptor 2 has been out for a couple hours, a couple people have used my link, but it isn't showing up. Does anyone know when these referrals update? Wouldn't want to lose $100!

Unfortunately, we can't pay the affiliate payment until everyone has the boards delivered. otherwise if people cancel we lose money.

Enertion help info actually says from after 90 days from the buyer receiving it. Shouldnt as you say the payment should be made from when they have it. Waiting another 90 days is a long time. Given the delay of shipping already by over 2 half months.

@Dedbny

Unfortunately, this has always been a stipulation with the affiliate program's Terms and Conditions, ever since it began.

The goods news is that hopefully we have more boards going out to customers very soon!

@lowGuido @ArmandR Hi Dean,  I recieved 2 payments the last being 2/8/18. After much hassling about payment. Supposedly some change in how the process was to be done. I had to request it directly with Jason.  

Now as you say the link to affliate program is dead. Ive emailed Adrian CS. Will see what he says. Im sure I still had a few buyers, but no pending payment. 90 days to clear from ther delivery date.I think I joined like 2 years ago. Way to much time to give them before they need to pay. If the sale goes through and they send item they should pay. It takes them forever to forfill R2s. 

By the way. Nice uploads on Youtube.

@Smithster Hot Topic. I dont believe Ive received any email about the program being discontinued. When did you get that email?

Suspect remaining payouts will not be honoured. Theres no way now of knowing what payments are left. I do have some emails of purchases. One recently as this year.

@lowGuido 
Sorry about the affiliate links being temporarily down! This was caused because Jason lost several credit cards while in China, one of which was linked the to affiliate website, LeadDyno.

I'm currently in the process of updating our subscription based software with new credit card details, so the affiliate links should work again within 24 hours. From Adrian Enertion CS

@lowGuido  My Affiliate link is back up and running. No new payments due.  As per previous comments it takes forever as the buyer has to keep it for at least 90 days before payout can be made.
