I am in the process of naming the decks as a way to distinguish between each one and every deck needs a name.

First is this drop down top mount deck.

My wife’s family came up with The Off-Shore, The Charter and The Low Tide. I like the low tide but it doesn’t give me that warm fuzzy feeling that makes me think yes that is it.

Second deck that needs a name is a fishtail style cruiser that resembles a 80’s/early 90’s deck.

I think the double paddle may have to be it’s name cause the pintail that I have is called the paddle out.

This isn't an American only forum bud, and even then some people still didn't agree with it. Let's just leave it at bomb or nuke and not get specific
