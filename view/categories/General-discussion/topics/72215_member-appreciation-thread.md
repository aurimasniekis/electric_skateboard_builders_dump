I'd like to thank @onloop for confirming that  production boards cannot satisfy my thirst for power lol

I'd like to thank @mmaner for being an all around bad ass and for coming down to skate with us.  

I'd like to give special thanks to a local rider and friend @Rod12579 for always being there for me and for helping us as a group make more and more crazy builds 
 @torqueboards for providing me with bad ass parts with the quickness to build the most bad ass diy boards!

@longhairedboy for be the OG, making cool boards and inspiring the rest of us
@Namasaki for keeping me friendly...when I don't really wanna be (sometimes)
@psychotiller because I frequently ask for some messed up shaped enclosures and he always comes through
@Sender for doing incredible CF work and keeping me on my game

If I forgot anyone, it is not meant as an insult, your just not important...joke, im at work and really want a nap, so yeah.

I especially want to thank @Kug3lis for helping me on my most mentally challenging thing I have ever done with my esk8.  figuring out how on earth to wire my lipos into a bms.  That my man,  is the single most helpful piece of advice I have received so far!

And @b264 for making sure an apple is an apple and for being the forum's grammar checker.
@mmaner - can generosity become unhealthy ?
@treenutter - I still regret not taking up on your generous offer of building a redemberboard for my first esk8-build :purple_heart: bringing balance, maturity and wisdom - a worthy leader
@GrecoMan - a great personality - but you need the chat and the chat needs you
@wafflejock - has any other member given as much real-time help as him? bring the chat back!
@bigben - beautiful work on this side of the pond and thanks for the enclosure!
@okp - still rockin you mount. TY!
@Eboosted - beautiful work that has spread to lots of builds

@Deckoz - already mentioned, but here's another mention
@Mikenopolis - maybe it's your cheeks?
@banjaxxed - you and @Sender are the guys it'd be great to have a few beers with   
I was gonna tag @AlexTech for stirring things up bringing some drama to the forum, but his name won't pop up lol. 
@onloop for hosting this forum, writing those "howto" threads that I read over and over and by that getting me into the DIYing of esk8
and the list goes on

@Eboosted Pretty sure it's physically impossible for Alan to say anything bad about anyone, also builds the sexiest boards on the forum

@Namasaki Wouldn't be suprised if your initials were BMS  

When ever I wonder if a motor will be powerfull enough for me, I just think , "would @b264 be able to ride across town on this with 50 lbs of groceries in his hand?" And then I have my answer. 

Thanks guys, the forum wouldn't be nearly as good without your, and neither would my boards :+1:

And @SeanHacker @trancejunkiexxl @Sender @sk8l8r for just being awesome

 
Oh whoops some of those folks aren't forum members.  Nonetheless, they deserve appreciation just the same.

I never realized pollution-free living was not only very possible, but also ridiculously enjoyable.

Where to start? :smiley:
 
from the top of my mind

@Namasaki Is of an understanding spirit, and a very nice helpful guy I'm sure he's a massive blessing to the people he's around.

@b264 Is  Basically, Basically, the esk8 guru. b264 has helped me countless times and inspired me to learn things beyond esk8 he's very influential in a good way.

@Deckoz Where you gone man :cry: you're our kickass safety gear wearing 13s building  blue power-ranger.

@Kug3lis  I may have annoyed him with my noobisum and other things (:joy:)
but that didn't stop him from basically doing his best to stop me from blowing things up and buying terrible parts.

@onloop I got into esk8 because of your videos then one thing led to another and i binged ur esk8 stuff So big thanks man and keep up the good work.

@hornet90 I would like to thank you for being Irish :joy:

@longhairedboy I think you're like a crystal plated teddy bear your lovable, tough and on the inside you really care for people Now back to esk8  your builds are epic and your posts are good reading.

@okp Your esk8 content is like a fantasy caught on camera, And I love how you dealt with free board
you could made a big brand name in some sort of french designer stuff.

@mmaner Always loved this guy unbiased, nice and helpful don't know why he wasn't made a mod sooner.

Thank you also @rich for your detailed build threads. We have a kind of the same set up and it’s very helpful in a lot of ways! Thx also for your videos! That one today made my day!
Thx to @okp for the best gt2b mod I can imagine😅 and your videos just make me to jump on my board and have a blast...
Thx to @moon and @rey8801 to organize some group buys which saved me some money (ok actually you guys made me to spend money😅) but I really appreciate that you both took the time to organize all the stuff

I would like to add @Michaelinvegas for all the money saving group buys and gathering the BEST event this past weekend. Having been to so many group rides, a gathering of mostly DIYers is just awesome. I don’t think I want to ride with majority Boosted and Evolve groups any more. 

Forever thank you to @BigBoyToys for the help with my early builds. To this day I search for his guidance in old posts. His passing has raised safety awareness that saved some potential injuries and death. 

Also thank you @jlabs for affordable parts. And the best safety gear group buy that must’ve saved a few lives for sure.

I would like to add @Michaelinvegas for all the money saving group buys and gathering the BEST event this past weekend.

Thanks for the mention. I'm humbled by the company you put me with.

Ugh...there are so many here that I so very much appreciate

Let’s go way back.... @onloop thanks for emailing me to invite me to the builders forum. Without this place, the rest of you would never be in my life.   

You all have become very dear to my heart ❤️ Especially after this weekend. I can’t wait to meet the rest of you. I have made so many new friends because of this site....and have made great ones as well.

I’ll just single out Jason....But to my brothers (and sisters) on here.... You know who you all are - BIG LOVE ❤️

FFS this is a long list.

First off, all the people who have bought x-tings and other stuff from me. You have my never-ending gratitude.  

In no particular order:

@onloop for paying for this forum so we can all think together

@michaelinvegas for showing us the best time ever last weekend - if you weren't there I'm sorry (it was the best set of rides ever and an amazing group of people - it was a freaking rock star convention and I was humbled to be amongst them)

@johnnymeduse and @blasto my Quebecois friends for always being up for beers, waiting up for me on rides (cause I'm slow), putting up with my questions, and being generally awesome people.  you guys are giants whose shoulders we all stand upon!

@longhairedboy for his general level of insanity - you are an inspiration to me to give up my stolid ways.

@kaly for too many things, but his sense of humor is overwhelming - never stop laughing because it's contagious!

@treenutter for his impeccable craftsmanship.

@alphamail for his inexhaustible wisdom.  

@mikenopolis for his generosity.  One day he might let me return a favor!  Seriously, next trip to lotus of siam is on me.  And what's with giving me that helmet bag?!?!  I should be giving you stuff!

```

@mmaner for...well the list is too damn long.  I guess the best summary is that he freely gives of himself to others and that we are better for it.

@sender for his wit and innovation - always doing something different in a new way.  I need to sit down with you and mmaner and polish off a keg of beer together one of these days.  I need to get down to AL over the winter or something.

@deckoz because of his willingness to help me out and push me out of my comfort zone.

@okp for his videos - keep them flowing!

@arch for letting me pick his brain in NYC and having a great time riding together.

@mikenyc because he's generally awesome.

@rojitor for all the effort helping to bring aulakiria's beautiful spot welder to us.

@evoheyax for enlightening conversation

@ackmaniac for the super sweet firmware

Vendors like @jlabs, @psychotiller, @thisguyhere, @torqueboards for making hard-to-find stuff easy to find!

And the moderation team for keeping this place running smoothly - it would be a nightmare without you!

I know I've missed people.  I'm still tired from Vegas!

Basically, everyone in this list and more are responsible for the following image:

Thanks to you guys, i can now cry in the bathroom knowing there's hope for a better future in which i'm not trapped in a cubicle but instead can live my dreams of building cool shit for people and traveling to meet everyone. 

But especially thank you @Lunasi and @treenutter for being such awesome and close friends and helping me realize that all of this isn't just pointless, that i don't have to be swallowed in my own madness, and that there's a greater mission we're all a part of.

@sebike, not sure why this is so confusing but let me explain so that maybe you can understand.  @chaka is Jeramiah, the owner of Ollin Board Comapny. Jeramiah became very busy and no longer has the time to be on the forums.  After being away from the forums for quite some time, we realized that it was important that Ollin get back to the forums and contribute to the community.  I am Melissa, Jeramiah's wife.  Although I have a day job I also work for Ollin Board Company on my off hours. Most have never heard of me because I usually worked behind the scenes packaging, placing components on VESCs, answering emails and other odds and ends. We decided that I, Melissa, would create @OllinBoardCompany and begin to be more active on the forums once again.  I will admit that sometimes I get asked questions that I cannot answer.  In these scenarios I do go to Jeramiah and ask him how I should respond.   Some day I hope to be as knowledgeable on esk8 as my husband but until then I will refer those questions to him.

I hope this helps clear things up for you.

@longhairedboy, that would be awesome if you brought the family! I know Jeramiah would really like to meet Jake.

@Michaelinvegas, much love, thanks for all the support you give all the vendors.

Thank you for clarifying that Melissa, although my confusion was rather me being silly than me being serious. It was my odd way of expressing that I'm happy you guys are finally back on the forum!

Thanks, I appreciate that!  Soon I will learn who everyone is and their personalities and will be able to tell when you are being silly :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

This community as a whole is pretty generous. 10ish months ago my friend got into a bad accident and lost his new board to the wheels of a car. You guys hooked him up with whatever spare parts you could send for little to no charge to get him back on the road again. I think that was pretty cool and that definitely shows something about you guys.
