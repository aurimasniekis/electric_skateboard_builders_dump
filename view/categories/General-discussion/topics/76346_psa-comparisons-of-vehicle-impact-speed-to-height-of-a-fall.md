Today I started to feel the results of a fall a couple of days ago, I really feel like I fell off a house... decided to check, turns out I was pretty accurate, 

"10 m.p.h. at impact is equivalent to falling 3.3 feet off a desk
15 m.p.h. at impact is equivalent to falling 7.5 feet off a ladder
20 m.p.h. at impact is equivalent to falling 13.4 feet off a 1 story bldg.
25 m.p.h. at impact is equivalent to falling 20 feet off a 2 story bldg.
30 m.p.h. at impact is equivalent to falling 30.0 feet off a 3 story bldg.
40 m.p.h. at impact is equivalent to falling 54.0 feet off a 5 story bldg."

I think I was about 15-18mph when I came to instant stop - apparently between falling of a ladder and a 1 story building.

I can't help but wonder about the survival rate of someone doing 40mph and hits say a concrete wall, a even a nice soft car.

My pads really helped but not so confident anything would help much at 40mph ... well maybe a full Iron Man suit.

@b264 "sub 30" seems like a pretty good survival tactic :smile:

Sub- 30mph (48km/h) is definitely my modus operandi.  *But I want to get to top-speed as soon as possible.*

just the feet... never gonna feel like your flying that way!!

just keep add hummie hubs till you run out of body space


EDIT: I do live in hope @Kug3lis has a custom iron man suit planned even in a far off future ;)

Just as addendum, we all know that force=mass x acceleration...

 I'm a 280# dude that had a bicycle accident back in early august at 25mph. I couldn't make a turn and came to an abrupt stop against a railing. I ended up breaking my humerus, radius, ulna and a metacarpal. 
so far, I've had 3 surgeries, I have 3 plates, something like 16 screws, they had to remove about 1.5" of my ulna, and fuse 2 of my wrist bones to my radius. Assuming everything continues to heal the way it has been, in early January(5 months later!) I'll start PT and learn how much flexibility I'll get back.

So the take-away I'm trying to put out is the bigger you are, the more risky even a moderate speed becomes.

 falling off a board you can slide out and just suffer a sliding injury with maybe road rash.   Look at pro cyclists Sprinting at min 40mph and they come off and often jump back on with a burned up ass and hips knees and shoulders.

Going off what you said yea all these people racing bikes or falling off a board and being ok are skinny.

the saying is "go big or go home" 
...I didn't go home that night.
if it hadn't been a abrupt stop, it would have been a touch of road rash and a lot of cursing. 
But since it was, instead a silent shocking moment, looking at my arm doing it's impression of an accordion!

you can't always be sure you have the luxury of some sliding, this is why I feel like I fell off something today so much... near instant stop

https://youtu.be/wWkAFQmL-wU?t=109

I would have loved for some sliding :)

EDIT: that said if I slid I would have hit a fence post

I only break 30 when thereâ€™s little to no chance Iâ€™ll hit anything if I fall, i.e. thereâ€™s no cars within a few hundred feet and itâ€™s a nice straightaway or slight curve with few obstacles. Donâ€™t really carve too much above 30 either.

Interesting findings. But we don't go from 20mph to 0mph because of roll and slides that happens right? Every time I watch the NYCeboarding videos I cringe, if the fall don't hurt you, a car might run you over while you are down.

I have only gone past 30 three or four time during testing of new builds, always done on smooth bike trails with bush and shrubbery on both sides, generally I stay under 20mph

Unless you run right straight into a brick wall without braking, a fall from an eskate will greatly reduce your speed. I don't have concrete numbers, but as an example, a tennis ball leaves a racket at 80mph, but by the time it bounces and reaches the other side, its only going 30mph, and a tennis ball is far "bouncier" than a human body.

So if you're going 30mph, fall, hit the ground and slide, you're probably going 15mph or less, depending on how long you've been sliding. You can survive a 7.5ft fall. What's interesting is that you can't survive a 7.5ft drop straight onto your head. So a 30mph fall from an eskate can still easily kill you, depending on the area of impact. But otherwise, if you hit, slide/roll and then hit a body part, you'll probably survive.

i've successfully run out an inconvenient cease in board momentum at 20mph. Angle of impact and redirective forces are certainly at work here.

I get fucked up if I try to run it out. Messed up foot n knee that took a long time to heal.   My greatest falls are when it comes out of nowhere and I donâ€™t have time to think.     rolling it out is risky as well.  I remember that 60mph dive in that promotional video for that sword board or whatever it was.   Heâ€™s a pro and went right into a belly slide and got right up.  If he had tried to run or roll it out I bet heâ€™d get seriously fucked up

We need suits covered in tiny ball bearings like chain mail in the form of teeny ball bearing races. That way any way you fall, you slide it out on your suit of balls.

I'm in the same boat, broken both ankles before multiple times skateing. Last time my truck broke at 20+ I got it down to maybe 15 before having to bail.... not sure the term 'run' is quite what I did.... more of a 'freakish hunchback looking dismount of flailingingness' 

@Mobutusan would be really cool to have some bearing pads, use your knees and elbow like slide pucs :slight_smile:

The most screwed up thing is how I skate now is that in my 30s I stopped leaving ground for more than 'Ollie's off kerbs n sh*t' for 'safety' !

eSK8 seems to have unleashed my old skool 80s inner child in my mid 40s :blush:

Had plenty of falls sub 20mph on boards and 2 above 50mph on my bikes.  The underlying comparison between these falls was the surprise factor.  One minute hurtling along the next laying thinking what the f***!   I can attest though the fast falls do feel like you fell off a house.  Especially the one where I headbutted a mercedes at 50mph and then somersaulted over the top.  Split vertebrae due to compression.  Definitely felt like I had nosedived into the ground from a five story building.  I now regularly do 40mph on my board but only when there is nothing for me to run into.  Rather have the road rash than the sudden stop.  The trouble is that when you have say a 1000 cc motorbike or a dual 12s board at some point both will feel slow to you and thats when the trouble can start.  Pad up and hope for the best. The rush keeps you alive though don't it??!!

I was going to the shops a couple of weeks ago and my neighbour came up alongside me doing 60km/h  I felt like I was just cruising till he told me how fast he was going.  Trouble is he told the wife the bastard.  Still working out my revenge.

Yes, this! :heart_eyes: Kind of like Black Panther's suit that absorbs, stores and releases energy from involuntary body slide breaking. Future tech right there. I want one.

Are friction capacitors a thing yet?

I've been reflecting and thinking about this a lot lately.   I'm almost 49 years old and weigh 240lbs.  I have two boards now.   One does 20mph the other can do 35 but I have it limited to 25mph. The fear of serious injury is real.  I pad up everytime I ride with no exception.  Losing weight will help in the event of a crash.

agreed! I fell hard about 11 months ago and was a fair bit heavier, a year of eSk8 binging I have more core and def. carry less fat - I really noticed the difference this time.
