just saw one of the kids in my neighborhood ride past on an eboard!

Looked like a single hub motor Chinese board similar in looks to a carvon EMC- either way, he was actually hauling pretty fast (with a helmet) for what I would have thought to be an underpowered board.

Many thanks to Ted and all the team, Frank, **BiG Up TRAMPA !!!**

Guess you work hard again this new year, wish you the best for the compagny, the team and your project.

I wish you will work on something like that, into your deck (or almost the alf of a battery pack into, master covered by flexy and strong carbon cover), and you get all !
