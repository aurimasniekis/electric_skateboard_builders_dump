So I've been riding my standard longboard for a while now and I'm slowly getting into the eskate part as well.

What guys of backpack do you guys use if you need to carry your board around? I'd like to use it as an ordinary backpack as well, so space for a laptop and some other junk would be useful :slightly_smiling_face: 

Thanks!

I haven't tried this since my board is pretty heavy to begin with, but I imagine that an external frame backpack would work best since they're more modular and adaptable.

Yes, a frame is a good thing :)

Plus there is a new player on that market but the thread title was just the brand name which wasn't self explainatory :D

The front wheels are MBS AT wheels (You can get them worldwide) and for the rear hubs motors I made sleeves based on the front wheels by myself. https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/diy-wheel-casting/6546/76 But please don't go offtopic here :D
