Its a funny shaped beast.  What battery are you trying to get in it?  
It tapers from 130mm to 110mm on the street side and tapers from 170mm to 130mm boardside.
Its depth is 45mm
Its overall length is 200mm boardside and 170mm street

6s LiPos. They are 150 x 50 x 50 basically. I think it might fit! Which is that, meepo?

mate if I could edit that pic I would with pretty dims all over it but alas i'm computerly challenged.
2 will go in if you use a thick gasket and keep them in the middle.  Bms if its a small one will either sneak in the side or up the front.
