where is the best place to buy inner tubes in usa or online? i need 8 inch ones to replace on my trampa board. i tried a couple hardware stores, home depot, target. i also tried harbor freight but their 8" tube was a different size then what i needed. this kind of makes me fearful to order online and i dont want to order directly from trampa because shipping over the pond.

any recommendations would be greatly appreciated! thanks

Plenty of 200 x 50 tubes on ebay. Scooter version will do.
