What's the best build of 2018?  Let's post links to build threads for a couple of days the have a poll. I'll start it off with my fave...

![bcac7cace13683dc64c929214fcf279db1c2a37a_1_690x295|690x295](upload://zakrMg6o4OHE5qy15KkrMUV2Wma.jpeg)

This board is innovation defined by both LaCroix and @Sender, true DIYit has a massive battery, super powerful motors and drive train and sexy as hell. I've ridden this deck, carvy and fast as mondo comfortable. Its first time I've thought about strong arm robbery üòÄ.

EDIT:. The poll is over here...

Thanks Mike, that means a lot to me!  I love this board.  I appreciate @Arch and the crew making such a bad ass platform to work with! 

There have been some bad ass builds this year all around.  From @mackann and @Battosaii 4x4s to all the sweet Hummie builds!  


I can't wait for 2019!  So many cool products coming  out to work with.  Gonna be a blast.   Who knows what we will all be rocking in June at the Rendezvous!

Seriously, all jokes aside. The people on this forum constantly amaze me with the builds you put out. I'm gonna stick around for a while (I hope) and I'm excited to see what comes out of 2019.

My vote stays the same though, I love that lacroix beast. Makes me wish I jumped on the group buy.

There are definitely better builds out there, figured I might as well throw in my first dual drive board though.

Thank you this was my first big battery build, my other battery's were small like a Ego 7s3p and a 10s3p for my Raptor. 

They are all 20awg silicone wires, I used different colors for organizing it, I had to upgrade the balance wires because I use a 8a charger and the 22awg wire is rated for 7a, I used 2 12awg wires to connect the series and a .2x25mm nickel strips for the P groups.

I don't really like rules but can we at least have a build thread for each nomination and say it has to be finished by midnight 12/31 GMT?

I'm 01/01-02 I'll post a new thread with all of the nominations, links to the build threads and a poll.  Then let the poll run for 7 days and call the most poll votes the winner. I'll make a trophy and gift bag for the winner.

I haven't publicly announced this build yet as it is not finished yet (I don't like creating build threads now until I'm done my build).

But just a sneak peek. It features:
- 12s5p of 5000mah zippys (25ah in total or 1110 Wh)
- 4wd hummie hubs
- 4x focbox
- DieBieMS (wired in parallel for higher amp discharge)
- Modified hummie deck
- Phycotiller enclosure
- Metr Pro Bluetooth Module
- A bunch of custom 3d printed parts, including an electronics tray (similar to enertions) so I have screw mounts and parts are easy to replace if needed (and going to cnc mill a mold for pouring a silicon grommet to seal the enclosure instead of the foam that's there now) 

All is all, expecting the build to be between 13.5hp (10k watts) to 15hp (12k watts), depending on what the focbox's can actually handle without throttling. Top speed should still be around 30 mph.

It may not be the sexiest build, but it's range and power are not an issue.

Weight is about 34lb only also (considering the 4x hubs and battery size, I thought that was pretty good).

Total cost to build was just under 2k USD.

Nicest looking deck would be the only one I‚Äôm interested in cause I just want to win something and I know mine isn‚Äôt the cleanest looking/innovative.

If you keep wet sanding at 2000 grit then give it a good buff with a buffing wheel and polishing compound and it will look like a mirror. I polish alot of gun parts it's a labor of love lol

six hours in the vibratory tumbler (green pyramids and simple green).  then using a muslin buffing wheel with fine compound, then a bare wheel without compound to shine it up.  This is already 1000x better than mill finish.  

and i totally get the labor of love thing - i just want it to be as perfect as i can make it.

I've also prepared battery modules which @moon knows already (gonna come back at it this week bro) and after need to send some to @longhairedboy for torture. 

As for the build itself, specs is : 
- 2x Escape VESC 6
- 2x Franken DIY DD/Hubs (I summon @b264) 
- 2x 12s2p
- 110mm wheels

List goes on. Hopefully I can make it to some races next year üèÅüèÅ

I will, promise ! It's incomplete but on first pic there's already sorta hubs mounted with the frame. 50mm motors. 

Short story these wait for air cooled aluminium flange for better heat dissipation, 18awg rewinding for moar powa (instead of stock 24awg multi strands) + hybrid axial flux on top of radial flux. Moar torque per amp.

Since there‚Äôs already been a few self nominations - I‚Äôd like to throw my name in the hat. Not for best build of 2018, but perhaps a contender for ‚Äúbest first build‚Äù, or ‚Äúbest novice build‚Äù.

https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/scream-bhuja-mini-carver-proteus-caliber-ii-caguamas-dual-flipsky-6354-unik-core-series-dual-mount-diy-samsung-30q-10s3p-unity-wooden-firefly-remote/78914

Not a lot of experience with any of this stuff prior to this build, and managed to complete (with varied success):

- wooden firefly remote build
- 10s3p 30Q battery build
- spot welder build
- ghetto vacuum bag carbon fibre enclosure
- custom griptape
- carbon fibre layer on deck
- modified caliber trucks
- didn‚Äôt burn house down, no fried vescs, only one fried bms

All of course with the benefit of the collective wisdom of this forum. My family and friends were completely puzzled at how I might have built this thing with no one to help or instruct me other than some strangers on the internet. They all thought it must be a kitset build, or that I‚Äôm some sort of crazy genius.

The most I get asked is "is it motorized?" And " how fast does it go". City dwellers usually have seen eskate tho so it might be different in your town.

Definitely the same here.
Just wait the day when I see myself in one of the funny russian YouTube Videos or an Instagram story...
Really every single ride as min 2 people making a video from me.
Min 3 ask what it is, how it‚Äôs called,what‚Äôs the price and if I made it by my own.

Having only been around this forum and looking at Esk8's for the past 4 months or so this thread has been really cool to look at and hear the different opinions of builders throughout the year. Even though I had pretty much read every one of the build sheet for this year's nominees I have absolutely enjoyed seeing the comments regarding them. I look forward to getting my build done hopefully this month and to see where this forum goes in the upcoming years!!

Nice man, I always loved how all the body panels on that car are bolted on even the rear quarter. I just don't fit very well in an AP1 but I fit in an AP2 they have slightly more leg room most people won't notice but me at 6'6" I noticed haha, I work for Honda btw. I like Honda's, I daily a 07 Element with a TSX motor, Ktuner ecu and I modefied the stock trans to be a 6 speed so its a little sleeper but my my 240sx is my racecar.

It was 2wd from the factory I'm going to keep it that way cause it's more reliable. I got the motor from the junkyard for $600 and the Ktuner plus tune was another $800 but for that I went from 170bhp to 230whp really cost efficient power upgrade haha. I spend more than that on single parts for my 240sx.

I love my element it has space for everything in the back and it doesn't drive like an SUV and more like a sporty car

it really wasn't a heavy swipe at all haha.. 10mph collision speed but the fender and door needed replaced and hood, bumper and rear quarter blended. the rear moulding on the rear quarter requires the car to basically be disassembled to remove it to not have a paint edge...lol pain in the ass.

Here is an example my auto cross wheels are CCX Classic wheels 17x10 all around $907 each wheel plus shipping and taxes... That is only the wheel you have you buy tires and take it somewhere that won't scratch your new wheels to install them. Also not including alignment and corner balancing at the race shop haha and those are just wheels.

Sorry to don't even post half the board or part I made, but the prototype takes time and asks so much time...

2017 was so awesome, 2018 was crazy, I can't imagine what 2019 will reserve us !?

You Sir have just brought a good news for me :beers: Thanks for the info, it's tiresome to find a properly sized roadster these days! I almost don't fit in the new MX5, can't tell if I fit at all in the old ones ; was convinced I wouldn't in a S2K either. Need to try this out now!

@Deckoz mad props for being this skilled, on the last pic the car looks brand new again that's crazy.

@Riako Thanks man! Yea I've spent too much time on these, need to get the blades running!

BTW that's **huge**, I wasn't much on the French forum lately so didn't know you were in so many projects at the same time! That's huge, love the Amadride dual VESC box (actually all your builds pics ooze of quality, I had to pick what got my eye first haha)

It's 70 x 40(/45)mm stator to stay in the Gummies.

I will start a build-log soon cause I'm gonna need your helps guys ^^ 

I made the MadBox for FocBox, V6, ESCape and FSESC6.6 (on prototyping).
https://amadridefr.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/duo.png
I'm working on a single multi-compatible shape and then just have to change the pattern of the heatsink.
And the dual ESCape maybe soon :

That's huge, keep up the good work ! I'm an extremist of the heatsink for ESCs and thermal patch (I think some topics around here have been lively in the past :laughing: ) so I really wanna see how good the thermal patch is haha

And Upvote for the extra big bearing, bigger is better !

Exactly. And when you don't, you have a better idea of how to be successful. And when you do, later that same knowledge can be used for something completely different unrelated, for a small common point. And your brain builds this mini encyclopedia of relatable things, soon enough things you've never done before, you will know how to do as soon as it comes up, without second thought. 

Knowledge is power, not because of the knowing, but because of similarity linking and reasoning. Do all the things ;)

I never anticipated the transferability of the things I have picked up in this venture into other facets of my life.

Like you said, as these connections are made it makes doing other things easier.  Building blocks of knowledge and know how.

I need to figure out how to strip paint off an old libtech snowboard. Apparently the top sheet with the graphic is fragile, but so rad I must take this project on. 
Your DIYness is inspiring. Keep up the awesomeness @Deckoz...

As much as you I guess ^^ (see even less!)

A lot of this was for French friends and customers/riders.
The reste is just prototyping (dreaming) with 3D print at home :smile: (like for my hub motor it could take around 2 years for a project to get all the money, but I don't care, I just do what I love with passion and time especially ;)  )

Actualy I just got the two last board, but yes I got a lot of spares amassed progressively since 2013 >.< 
1st board made in 1 and alf year at the time ! ! ! :grin:

Need to get descent on shittier boards first.  It does go well with skinning.  The increased strength from the skin would offset the loss of the battery cutout.
