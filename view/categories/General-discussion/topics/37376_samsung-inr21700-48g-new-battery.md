Now that's what I'm talking about ðŸ˜ƒ
3P of that....sexy
Cycle life ain't so sexy though at high discharge, still pretty good though

Very interesting, are these already on the market or when can we expect them?

Reads like a 10Ga cell: 3500mAh and 10A continuous discharge. But it's in a larger package compared to 18650 - what's the benefit then?

Edit: nevermind - took the capacity from the wrong table (after 500 cycles)
