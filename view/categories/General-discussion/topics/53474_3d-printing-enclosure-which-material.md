Hi 
which material did you used to print your enclosure?

I thought about pla, petg or nylon but nylon is a bit overkill.
I don't like abs for some reasons.

Thanks

PETG is the most common

I did it in petg. Tried in ABS but the long sides are really a problem even with enclosure.

If ABS is warping... go with lager brim and even tape the brim down to heat bed and rock and roll.

I do print with ABS but the enclosure has to be printed vertical to increase the strength. The problem is not first layers or the brim. But the 3mm wall that after a while starts warping and it ended up with the nozzle touching it... This the result in the morning ![IMG_20180317_081949|690x388](upload://LG7nWAjjif4r8vMV3Lt7fNEs9L.jpg)
PETG much easier for longer prints.

You sure that printing it vertically will increase strength? I would have guessed the other if you see the layers as the weakest parts (which is surely is) :thinking:

True, but judging the # of z layers in that preticular pic, it didn’t get very far before it failed.

I hate when you return to your printer only to see a plastic hair ball.

Indeed that was the worst case. In that case the problem that ABS doesn't like the raft. So the print didn't fused well with them. Later on I tried again with just brim and it went further but aroubd 5 cm it failed again. I do print ABS stuff, but when I know that I can decrease the pulling force on the surface due to holes in the STL file. Like this raiser ![IMG_20180328_063936|690x388](upload://j7ytFTuCD3b9lnlI4tt1QgBarv6.jpg)

To print abs, mix some abs with acetone, smear the bed with it. It looks a mess, but it will never detach from the bed due to warping again. I fill an old glass coffee pot up with acetone and chuck scrap bits of abs into. Its also great for glued bits together. Also for thin walls, use minimal shells and 100 % infill, its much much stronger than multiple shells with filament all orientated in a single direction. Getting of the bed can be fun, nice sharp scraper and brute force.

ABS slurry, nice.

Acetone vapours in an enclosed space is alse good for finishing ABS parts,preferably on a rotating bed

I tried ABS and my enclosure snap in half (70% infill).
I print again with PETG and 100% infill

Here is my final result

Main reason i love abs is because of acetone. If i redesign something i only need to reprint a specific section, cut the bit out and glue the redesigned bit back with acetone. Its as strong as the rest of the part. Oh and acetone something of course. Its so versatile.

Did my first enclosure out of abs your right about using acetone mixed with some abs as paste but it eventually gets gross.  Right now using a pla one, I had planned to make a mold but after some practice with that I realized the walls I modelled are too thin and won't work well in a silicone mold so I just glued the pla parts together and sprayed the whole thing with some filler spray and sanded it down then covered with regular paint so far has held up better than the abs one.  I tried nylon like 8 times but always failed like half way through the print, it'd be ideal if warping and slipping in the extruder wasn't an issue.

I also use ABS juice to stick ABS, PETG on the glass. If you do not use the clamp how do you keep the glass on the heated bed? or do you print directly on aluminium? Now I got some PEI sheet and I will try to use those without anything else.

PLA is a lot my abrasion resistant, but i sometimes leave my board in the car, and on a hot day it will warp :( plus ive tried every glue imaginable sticking pla to pla. It always fails. I need to try petg soon. Fibreglassing a 3d printed enclosure is best idea, which ill do once ive settled on my final design.

The chrome metal handles on your clamps are removable. Everyone leaves them on not realising the noise they make :laughing: I used to take them on and off they got fed up and bought these.

Yeah true on the warping luckily mine is typically just outside or hanging on the wall so hasn't really had any issue with that.  For gluing them I just used some gel super glue I'm pretty sure... that did an okay job and I designed my enclosure with a split where a screw can hold both sides together so it's supported by that screw (also think the filler and paint is helping quite a bit just to keep it all together).  Think PETG does sound like an ideal compromise and possibly lining with fiberglass, my original one I just lined with gorilla/duck-tape which by itself helped quite a bit. 

Regarding the clips they do make quite a bit of noise, but personally built an enclosure around my printer so don't  hear that so much but can also flip them up onto the glass if you aren't using the whole print area and they stop rattling around.

Just pull the handles off the clip

“Buildtak” people... does wonders. No tape, no abs juice no enclosure even.  For about $10usd give it a try. Get mine from micro center 

While at it get the buildtak spatula 

Try printing igus... its a lubricant and can imagine how hard it is to get it to stick.

PETG is no picnic to glue either.  Also what does the bottom sides of your prints look like with all the abs juice, seems so thick your print size/scale would be off (nothing against what works tho, just curious).

(could only view with phone earlier, now at home)

Just like I'm curious to know if anybody airbrushes out their ABS prints with acetone on a turntable (<not record/45 player)???

I use E3D Edge. This stuff is by far the nicest filament to print with out of my experience using PLA ABS and PETG. I used it for my enclosure, and it works fantasticly.

Check out their website. This filament is equally strong in all orientations and will not delaminate at 100% infill. It is very stiff until it yeilds, but from my testing will not easily crack. It also can have solvents used as glue. I haven't tried acetone, but I used acrylic cement (just a plain solvent) and it worked great.

I also used this for my wheel pulleys. After months of use, no signs of wear besides from pebbles.

If I print it flat it's not as strong as iI would print it vertical? can you explain me why? :sweat_smile:

IF you printi it flat it's easier to print and also abs will work. It is recommended if you want ot use it as a mold but by doing in this way your layer would be parallel to the skate and so to the weight and gravity increasing a lot the chances of layer separation. IF you print it vertically then your layers are perpendicular to the main vector force and so way stonger...Print it like this ![IMG_20180406_210110|690x388](upload://rgdMaMMdkvN4z1NxTFfN0Rilct4.jpg)

I disagree. In that orientation, if your deck flexes at all, you're very likely to crack the enclosure. That oritentation is also very bad for bolts that go through it, tightening them too much will easily crack the print and delaminate through the bolt hole.

I printed mine horizontal, with thick 3/4 inch side walls 100% infill, and it is holding up well. No cracks, and the enclosure is 20 inches long. It's so strong that it prevents the deck from flexing, and it only dips 1 inch below the bottom of the deck.


Bending perpendicular to layers is strong.
Compression and tension perpendicular to layers is okay ish.
Tension and compression parallel to layers is great.


Shear and bending forces parallel to layers is very very bad.

Just keep these forces in mind when deciding what orientation to print. Some enclosures will benefit from one orientation, while others will be the contrary.


As a general rule of thumb for printing structural esk8 parts, print at a high heat to ensure complete adhesion, and up your extrusion multiplier slightly to ensure good Infill and adhesion. I highly recommend using 100% infill, but also 4-6 wall layers. It also helps to increase your later thickness and width at the cost of surface finish. My enclosure is 0.3mm thick, 0.5 mm wide, using a .35mm diameter extruder.

I have never broken an enclosure, even after slamming my board directly into a concrete wall at 20mph.

As you said depends on the deck. Mine is a stiff deck and the main stress is applied vertically on the enclosure. That's why print it in that orientation will improve the strength. Anyhow in both the orientation you will have a weak point. I agree with what you said about infill ecc... I will also say that filament like PETG at 100% infill is still flexible, which helps to absorb vibration. Moreover another important factor is to fix all you component (at least the battery to the deck) otherwise I doubt a 3D printed enclosure will last enough longer.
