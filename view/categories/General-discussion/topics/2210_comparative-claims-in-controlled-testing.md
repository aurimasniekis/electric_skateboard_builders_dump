The e-skate is missing some standards here...too many commercial claims without context or benchmarks. I think the solution is controlled testing with the proper equipment. Mellow and Inboard both have testing rigs...Mellow has said that theirs will be used not only to test their build, but also measure the claims of other boards. 

Math is great, but can only get you so far. Does anyone else out there have testing rigs/dyno's?

I'd love to see numbers like:
- with 70kg load, can reach 44 kmh on flatland, and maintain for 2.5 hours within normal operating termperature of xx C.
- with 70kg load, can start from 0 kmh on 10% hill, reach top speed of 30 kmh and maintain until battery depletion within normal operating temperature
- can brake 100 kg load on 10% downhill in 10m ;-)

all they (inboard) need to do is make a video of it going up a hill...  the real world is a pretty good test

Sorry, I'm all about the scientific method. 

No, but really, my real reason is to see how each matches up against the others. The comparative video you did with a Dual and 1WD Raptor was nice. Either side-by-side or in the same situation with same rider.

They've all done videos of boards going up hills. Not convincing. The run-up is often cut out, they go up in a diagonal, or they use the skinniest guy on the team...

However necessary, I have to say I agree to @onloop for testing. Scientific method is a matter of justification for getting numbers. Eventhough all the scientific test are successful and the numbers are okay, the purpose of those test are for end users are for real life applications. It's a good test, but I doubt it will happen and as end user I really don't care much as long as it works.

Eboard landscape is changing quickly. I'd like to see gizmag or some other publication do an updated comparison. Ideally a comparison that combines scientific testing with real world/real conditions. Same type format you'd find in a car or motorcycle comparison. I am tired of seeing videos of a 160lbs dude roll up a slight incline as supporting evidence of a boards hill worthiness.

But manufacturers/sellers do put out numbers wattage being the biggy.  But it's not a standardized test and they don't even say continuous power or burst.  People latch onto the number like it means something but it's obviously bunk in most cases

No one wants to run a bunch of motors to the point of burning them as a test of max power but it wouldn't be hard to make a valid assumption based on the motor temp at different wattages put in and conponent's abilities. If there were real numbers put out we could know if it would get up a hill with a certain weight or not. We can't compare anything really

If they were accurate, and real, then they'd tell you everything.  A real continuous wattage test.  

Given that there isn't a standardized wattage test, and a real world test isn't standardized and not replicable, the next best thing, if not the same thing really...wait for it...wait for it...knowing the motor's components and airgap.  It's like we're on a Ferris wheel and keep coming around again.

Well thats not really possible. There are also many varieties of incline / slope. I could climb a 40 degree incline that is 30 cm long if I have 5 meter initial path to accelerate. But does that mean my board setup can climb 40 degree looking from other people assumption, probably not. There are so much variables that could make your experiment / test invalid.

For a valid laboratory test, there has to be minimum 10 trials with 3 variable factors that needs to be determined. Independent variable, dependent variable and control. Independent variables are the things that you can change, dependent variables are the result you are searching and controls are other variable that should stay the same.

Now to begin with people already have different weight and different hill. Despite of that, there are different battery type, motor kv, propulsion system and misc board construction part.

The test can work if we are only test per brand basis, ie: Raptors Dual. However once parts are being replaced, wires are changed and things are modified those numbers are not valid anymore. The difference eboard common setup safely varies about 20% better or reduced performance one with another.

And trust me no one here would bring a ruler or measure the incline slope of the hills they are about to climb. Even if you are about to buy an electric longboard, I assume you won't do that either. And clearly if you live on a mountain, you will opt for an all terrain high gear ratio mountain board and before that going to take place, ebike would be the better option to buy. And even if your eboard setup fails to climb the hill you want, you will change your pulley / propulsion setup. Thats why if you already think of hills, better get satellite configurations. And if the gear are already maximized for torque, then kick push it like normal board.

The point here is the number are not that important. The only possible number I could think that would make sense are not hill grade but torque rating in newton meter. It's more controlled and easy to compare motor performance. But beware that the small brushless outrunner motor we have has various torque output depending on the rpm. It's made to deliver the highest torque at maximum speed (If I recall correctly).

Stepping back from all of the numbers, electric longboard is just a longboard made to increase coasting time and without kicking. No one buys a longboard and ride uphill.

So why do we care what manufacturers of complete boards are claiming ?
They'll claim anything that makes their product sell.
I think if you hang around our community for long enough you'll soak up enough knowledge and insight to debunk the claims for yourself, without some useless regulation. Just my $.02.

Well, it's a bit ironic, because Onloop himself has blurred the lines. He sells mass-produced completes. "Mass produced" is a bit of a stretch to say since he's a one-man show (mostly), but there are models that you can choose that are made in multiple copies. Enertion is the same as Boosted and Evolve, except he sells kits and parts as well. In terms of customization, Enertion gives even less than say, Mellow Drive, because you can get a Raptor deck in all shapes and sizes as long as it's rigid black carbon. :-) 

@laurnts, we agree. Numbers can lie, but gather enough of them controlled conditions, and they tell a better story than "my board can do a decent hill." 

[quote="laurnts, post:12, topic:2210"]

I do. My e-skate isn't a longboard but my snowboard that gives the same feeling not only when there's no snow, but when I go flat or uphill. That's what I tell people who say I'm lazy, btw: yeah - you try pushing your skate at 40 kmh uphill. 

Also, you forget the brake. I accept that I'm a perfectly irresponsible father and bad longboarder who can't slide so can't really bomb hills, but I love taking steep downhills while being able to control my speed. My 10 year old daughter, who can't kick or footbrake well, followed me down a succession of 20% curves and we both had a ball. We kept the speed down low on the knife's edge between safety and thrill.

[/quote]
That's backwards. Highest torque for all electric motors is at V=0, which is why a Tesla will slaughter sports cars out of the gate, but lose ground later on. The torque curve then drops gradually until the field weakening phase, where it drops drastically until it hits maximum rpm. The beginning of the field weakening is called the max rated speed.

I agree with you that torque tells a better story than hill grade, although the latter includes a bit of legal liability in there, i.e. the product can climb steeper hills, but will probably overheat and kill your motors. Still, a easily understandable and more precise middle ground might be nice. When I just see "Climbs hill grade 15%" I assume that they mean "it can carry the max rated load up that hill for an indefinite period of time without overheat, regardless if there was a running start or from a dead stop". I'm pretty sure though, that that's assuming much too much.

So, back to torque. Mellow published their torque curve. It's a calculation, which still makes it a claim, since it was done before they setup their testing rig. The fact that torque doesn't change until 40km/h is mind blowing. You know how you have to brace yourself when hit the throttle? When I did a testride of the board, even up near 35 km/h, I'd get that exact same kick. Crazy.

Mellow torque curve: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1800147378/mellow-the-electric-drive-that-fits-under-every-sk/posts/1352482?lang=de

I'm curious about torque curves of other motors perform so I'll make a new thread though...

@onloop 
I am sorry, but in almost every post you make you seem like more and more of an asshole. I understand that you made this forum, but when it comes to some issues (like wanting actual performance numbers) you seem ridiculously stubborn, and refuse to change your mind when there are many people saying the opposite. 

[quote="onloop, post:8, topic:2210"]

[/quote]
Numbers do mean something, literally everything can be defined and compared using numbers. Why do you think automotive racing teams spend so much time with their motors on dynos before they even put them in the car? Its because when its on the dyno they get a hard number on how much performance they have, VS on the road it can be very subjective and there are hundreds of variables that can change each run.

[quote="onloop, post:8, topic:2210"]

[/quote]
yes numbers can be made up but that's a thing i like to call fraud/lying, which is a dick move, and when it comes to selling things (such as esk8 parts) there are actual laws against it.
[quote="onloop, post:8, topic:2210"]

[/quote]
WTF are you talking about? If we have two boards, with accurate numbers for their performance, then it is very easy to compare them on certain aspects and decide which one is better. Like other people have said, saying a board can go up a "decent hill" doesnt mean shit. If you can say that one board can go up a 15% hill at 10Mph for 5 minutes with a max motor temp of 80Â°F, and another can go up a 15% hill at 15Mph for 3 minutes with a max motor temp of 90Â°F. Then it clearly shows that if you have long hill then you want the first one, but if you have a short hill/want to go faster then you want the second one.
[quote="onloop, post:8, topic:2210"]
real world testing is the ultimate test.
[/quote]
I'll give you a half point for this, you can do all the lab testing you want, but it does come down to when the urethane meets the road. That being said, if you do thorough testing in a controlled way, when you bring multiple board out to the real world and compare them. Most of the time your real world testing (if you are doing the exact same test with each one) will match up almost perfectly with the lab testing.


Sorry for the rant, but it really bugs me when people straight up refuse science and reason.

I agree, when you break anything down it's just numbers on paper, but numerical figures alone are not proof of anything. A motor can have higher effecientcy and higher torque claims on paper. But it doesn't prove anything. Making a calculated decision from those numbers is nothing more than guessing.

Claims should be proven/tested in a way that allow untrained observers to clearly see the subject executing the claim in its simplest form. Numbers are not important anymore. Because the observer can see that test subject X completes the circuit before Y. So X is faster.

Observing the act alone is emperical evidence of a said claim.

We don't need numbers on paper we simply need undeniable proof.

So I say, please show me videos of performance don't tell me your numbers.

[/quote]

I am not saying this is right or wrong, but I have to agree within magnetic terminology maximum torque is produced in a near stall position of the rotor. However necessary the fact that we are having this hill grade discussions is because they doesn't seems to work that way when being put together with an esc. Otherwise no one would have a problem starting standstill on a hill / ride it to the slowest possible speed. I really believe that the rated speed is the moment where the motor could provide the maximum torque in real conditions.

One way of another speaking about Tesla, they stated in their website that they are using 3 phase AC induction motor. They are not normal brushless dc motor. Their motor runs without magnets, so it doesnt depend on motor magnets strength to output torque, pure mega current draw from their battery packs.

Increase in torque means increase in current draw or how much current it could deliver. The motor cogs (pulsing) because the ESC can't determine which phase it should power the motor. But I also doubt that sensored motor have 0 cogs at low speed (never tested it).

---

Btw please stop discussing about numbers vs video. This is more destructive rather than educative. They do need each other. You can have all the numbers but without no one ever made a single video / proof it's ever rolling its meaningless. Same to video, without number people can't compare or relate to other builds.

The answer to the question of Comparative controlled testing is who is able, would like and or be able to do just that. Without it the eboard community can live without it, us making whole bunch of this is a proof that we can build without numbers. As for the same time, we need this forum because we can't find, relate and be exactly convinced that the selections of parts we bought does work on the environment we would like to ride

```
From my own experience, motors seem to peak in output at about 70% to 80% of the max rpm. Performance at zero is insignificant to me since I always give a good healthy kick before mashing the throttle but I do feel a definite surge when nearing the top speed on my boards. Smaller motors seem to surge more than their larger counterparts. Maybe the larger motors would give a more pronounced boost if the were more heavily loaded?

This is not really a discussion about basic specs though.... you wanted to discuss testing various brands of esk8 using dynos to get a set of data results.

Nominal voltage, watt hours, motor kv, wheel size, motor size, peak watts/amps etc... this info is not scientific evidence of the performance. 

My point here is... why invest time and money into doing these scientific tests using dynos when you can grab two boards and walk into the street and have your answers within a matter of minutes.

"Nominal voltage, watt hours, motor kv, wheel size, motor size, peak watts/amps etc... this info is not scientific evidence of the performance". Yes it is.


when does a motor produce the most torque and why.  People are disagreeing. I though the sole determinant was the steel stator and how big it's teeth are, bigger be less likely to magnetically saturate.  Torque equates to magnetism. Will more teeth make more torque or bigger teeth.:laughing:  many small or few big. I wouldn't have thought it was speed dependent.

**Basic specs written on a page is not evidence of performance!**

Emperical evidence must be observable & undeniable.

For example. Max top speed based on a paper calculation of the above specs will not actually be what happens in the real world....

Unless of course you factor every single variable into your equation
Some of the variables include.
1. Wind resistance 
2. Rolling resistance
3. Wheel hardness
4. Temperature 
5. Esc effecientcy 
6. Motor effecientcy
7. Mechanical losses
8. Motor core losses 
9. Control algorithms 
10. Field weakening characteristics.
11. Bearing friction losses.
12. Rider stance 
13. Rider height.
14. Rider width.
......
......
......

The list goes on and on... no one is going to perform this level of scientific study anytime soon... Unless maybe someone on here does a thesis on electric skateboard performance for their degree in electrical engineering. It's probably not going to happen.... 

So simply stand on the board and ride it as fast as it will go and check your speed. Now get the other brand of board and repeat the test.

**Its really simple....  step away from the computer and ride!**

I like numbers too! Very useful when making comparisons. 
In stand alone tests though they almost never match up . 
I think Jason's point is you can see successes and failures in video comparisons. Also, you can easily call bullshit on obvious editing. Not so with spec sheets.

[quote="onloop, post:32, topic:2210"]
For example. Max top speed based on a paper calculation of the above specs will not actually be what happens in the real world....

Unless of course you factor every single variable into your equation
[/quote]

But if all the boards are tested the same way, in the same conditions (using a dyno), the other variables don't matter as they will apply to all of them. So you can have one board that has a rated top speed of 20mph and another with a rating of 30mph. 99% of the time, if you put both of them in the same conditions, the one with a rating of 30mph should go faster since all those other variables are acting on them in the same way.

[quote="onloop, post:32, topic:2210"]
So simply stand on the board and ride it as fast as it will go and check your speed. Now get the other brand of board and repeat the test.

Not all of us can afford to drop thousands buying and testing different boards. For people like me who are still trying to save up money to buy/build one, testing like what is being discussed here can help us make decisions on what parts/board will fit our requirements the best.

Totally agree on this, but if you spend some time reading some members post. It's pretty clear if you aim lower price, you need to get single drive kit, motor from HK, cheap TX RX and lipo stacking. The cheapest possible solution with the most output you can possibly get. However on those part make sure you have one best part to begin with, ie VESC / motor. So next time you have money, you can upgrade. One solid thing I have to say is that eBoard is not cheap. You can't just force your self owning something you can't afford. The chances people do DIY is they want to proof something, make something better or make something happen. If you aim to get cheap, I suggest get a ready made board from alibaba / aliexpress with 1 year warranty and upgrading from there. First you have a working board, second still upgradeable within your budget.

Numbers and real performance can't go without each other. One prefer numbers, one prefer real life condition. This discussion feels very childishly finger pointing stupid while the truth is that both need to exist, just for the sake of ego. 

It's time to make some popcorn and keep reading how it goes lol.

Sorry, you are wrong. You need to test in the real world. lab performance doesn't translate into real-world results.

If a board, or just the motor, is attached to a dyno how do you accurately simulate load? I want to know the result with a rider onboard not just a paper result of an unloaded test. Also, the load is variable depending on incline, wind etc

In theory, a tiny little 42mm motor could spin at the same RPM & Perhaps deliver a similar torque curve as a much larger 63mm motor. So to get meaningful results your dyno will need a load generator that simulates rider weight, also it needs to somehow introduce a slight increase in load as speed increases to simulate wind resistance.

The easiest option is to establish a standard real world test, like the 1/4 mile sprint for cars.. e.g. 100kg rider weight, 100m sprint from stationary start. This is easy to record on video. Every supplier can replicate it fairly easy with little expense, its fairly obvious to the viewer if it has been faked, it can be replicated by anyone. It's testing torque & top speed performance.

Hill climbing is what I am personally interested in, none of these mainstream brands seem keen to show us hill climbing performance... come on inboard & mellow... one video is all I ask.

Like I said at the beginning... real world tests are better... everyone needs to go & ride.

_if you don't agree with my statement that's fine too..._

Hey, I'll be doing real world testing and comparisons as soon as get my raptor dual shipped.  I have an inboard M1 on the way, and already own a boosted dual plus.  

The video will include objective tests in controlled conditions  (like max speed, range, hill climbing ability, and acceleration), and subjective tests (feel, fit and finish, ride quality, durability, design).  I'll also include things like customer service.

So all this meaningless argument from your computers is not necessary.

Wind? Non-consistent inclines? These variables are exactly WHY real world testing is inherently unreliable in comparisons. What to do with them? Eliminate them, so they don't adulterate the results. 

How do you quality check your products, Onloop? Real world? Is a defect going to slip through because there was a strong back wind, or you decided to take the left side of the hill with the helpful depression, instead of the right side because a car happened by that day?

@Calhoun I totally agree with you. There are ways to simulate load. A proper piece of test equipment needs to be modified/engineered to accomplish this. The best way to begin testing is to create a baseline and then introduce variables. But first it is important to remove all variables to create that baseline. Once a good baseline is set, you can scientifically test the results of each variable vs. baseline. You can test individual variables or combinations of different variables to accurately test different configurations. Without a baseline to test against, there is no solid reference. That's how "**Real world testing** works!! Otherwise you are just playing with a prototype and fooling yourself. If there is no reference, you really can't even call it "testing". Am I right? 
I appreciate what you are doing here and it is good. You are stirring up the pot. Challenging the status quo. That challenges all of us to elevate our game. I am  very much in support of changing the game and upping the ante.
BS testing claims just piss me off. I work for a company that makes the wiring harnesses for Brammo Motorsports. In fact I cost estimated the first revision of wiring harnesses and had a hand in the redesign of the harness for the Enertia when the company was still pre-revenue. Brammo spent a lot of money dyno testing and testing with other specialized rigs,  custom made for testing EVs. They are now quite succesful and their new location is set up very well in Ashland, OR USA.  https://www.brammo.com/integrated-solutions/case-studies/empulse-r/
If you call them up, they can answer any questions you have about anything from dielectrics to gear ratios. Maybe Brammo would be interested in adding some products to the lineup. Maybe a dyno tested brushless motor?  LOL  They are a super chill, progressive company. I believe that PEVs are the future.
Thanks for starting this thread up, Calhoun. :thumbsup:

Make no mistake, @onloop, this is an excellent https://youtu.be/JgKPCrG5Nyc

But you made it, and sell one of the products in it, so it is by definition a marketing video. If you insist on using non-impartial means of comparison, then be ready to be doubted. All the variable factors you mentioned could be in play on any of those runs, so what use are they. Did you slam the throttle? Did your knees buckle a bit on the Boosted? Do you have a financial stake in the results? 

But yes, I am indeed writing from the point of view of what you call "eboard noobs" and "crazy people", also known as "forum members". A wise man once recommended taking part in online forums in his instructions build the perfect DIY:

> Please be open minded & willing to learn... be willing to ask analytical questions & be understanding... people are more than willing to help you if you listen.

Even with my limited info (from reading your forum, ES, and owning mass produced boards) I am still unsatisfied with the incomplete, biased and unusable numbers/claims to compare what's out there, or even to be convinced to go the DIY route. Some of you know I'm enthused about Mellow, but yes, I even after doing my own real world demo of their prototype, I still take their claims with a grain of salt and want hard numbers. 

Onloop, your attitude and name-calling closes the community to outsiders, noobs, non-technical people, and more. If this is your goal, perhaps consider screening new members. 

**No one sees a problem if an e-board seller claims their product has "enough torque to go up ANY hill"?** 

@Ulfberht Thanks for the kind words. I'm just a consumer who sees DIY as just another product... One with perhaps the most unreliable manufacturer of them all: myself. Just like many forum members here, I love seeing what's out there, both mass-produced and DIY, and I search for reasons and arguments (for myself) to invest in my next ride. 

There is as yet no perfect, all-around lightweight, super performant board, so I need a quiver. Multiple boards cost money. And so, yes, I'd love to know clearly how each matches up before I spend.

The website is called electric skateboard **builders**

It is not;
electric skateboard testers.
Electric skateboard science.
Electric skateboards performance data.

Its for everyday people who like to build eboards and share their experiences. I also like to think it can be about celebrating the riding experience too...

You can sit behind your desk and argue about specs and test equipment with people on forums or you can build an esk8 and go for a ride and have some fun... Its really up to you. But I prefer if the majority of forums members where the later and I would also bet that the majority of forum members here don't care about the numbers as long as a product works well in their use case.

I honestly think this level of technical discussion you desire is probably better on endless sphere in the motor section... 

I totally understand that you as a consumer wants as much information spoon fed to you as possible so you can make the best decision. But it's not going to happen unless you go out and do it, which i think would be totally awesome!

For me however i am more of a do'er not just someone who is willing to wait around for answers.

The only way your dream of an unbiased testing facilty will happen is if an independent  third party decides it wants to invest at minimum $10 or $15k on dynamometer and design a set of tests for electric skateboards and publish the data publicly...  of course they will also need to cough up the funds to buy at least the 5 or 6 top eboards on the market so they have test subjects.. it could take about $30k before one result is produced.

I think you need to accept that The various brands selling electric skateboards will never invest money in this kind of advanced equipment or the the time it takes to compare their product with competitors, let alone release the data publicly. Even if they did people like you would say the data coming from them is biased because they have a vested interest.

So after spending $20k or $30k to setup your test lab you still only have a bunch of numbers that lots of average people won't really know how to interpret anyway... 2nm of torque at 6000rpm doesn't make much sense to most people. In fact the first thing they will likely ask is for some video evidence. Or simple things like how fast does it go, how long does battery last. Etc.

I know this because my customers tell me this over and over and have done so for the past three years that i have spent designing, building, testing & selling electric skateboards... rarely do they ask for dyno charts. In fact i think you are the first person. They do however want video!. I suppose video is more digestible. It's an extremely effective method of of communicating information  and explaining what otherwise would be technical, complex and confusing to the average consumer. Most people don't know what kv, Current or torque output means. But show them a product finishing a sprint quicker than another one and they know that one was faster.

So I personally think you don't need the dyno. Save the $15k just go buy some eboards, go to a velodrome, take a stop watch with you and a video camera. Have some fun riding and making an educational video and do your best to be objective as possible....

I can guarantee the riding video will get more views than your list of numbers produced from various bench tests..

I am just as passionate as anyone else so when a topic comes up that I have an opinion about I will likely express it... sometimes the tone I take might offend others, If so i appologise. But I will not back down if I outright disagree with somthing. I will always express my opinion. 

Anyway.. go and get your data it won't hurt.

I'll be out riding and testing in the real world.

Peace.

Onloop my first post is so far up now that it's been forgotten. Read the last few lines again. 

I spoke about a dyno only as a means to obtain impartial figures that can then be translated to more complete specs widely understood by everyone, whether you make or you buy. 

All builders make claims, but... 

I don't care about torque, I want to know how long it can climb that hill with my fat ass on it before burning up.
 
I don't care about max range, I want to know what load and speed that was measured with. I am not an idiot and know that starting and stopping will influence this. 

I don't care about top speed, I want to know how long it will hold before diminishing. (this is actually trickier to explain without getting into how battery voltage influences speed, which is admittedly technical.). 

I don't care about having re-gen braking, all electric motors can do this, I want to know if it can bring my fat ass to a complete stop on a 20% downhill without bringing my lithium to a slow boil. 

I'm technically a builder since I've ripped part my crappy E-go so many times and Frankensteined it back together. Small fish, I know, but it counts. But what I don't know, I read about. And those things are above you and your clients may not want to know, but I do, so here I am and here I belong. 

Feel free to make a video that shows all the above, but I can guarantee you that I'd rather read about range, than sit through vomitous 40+ km, 2 hour gopro footage. 

Disclaimer: I don't actually have a fat ass.

The numbers are for the builders and manufacturers. I have a car but I never know the max speed or how much nanometer torque it has. I dont know if it can brake within 5m on 100kmh.

So if you plan on selling it in the end, look on your customer. They only wantto know how far, how long, how cheap? All people doubt about hill grade anyway. If it can climb thats a plus.

Most noob consumer still think its a toy, expectation is quiet low. If it doesnt climb, thats understandable.

However its understandable that we need some guidelines for specs capability. Not for most, but its the next step towards LEV legability. Thats the reason why we need CE testing and driving test. Its for this and its not cheap to do with independent company. About 1K usd ++

@laurnts, if your choice of car decided whether or not you could make it up that last hill or kilometer without having to walk, yes, you would be worried about that type of performance. 

Are you really trying to convince me that car enthusiasts don't care about top speed though? You've never heard the line "0 to 60 in x seconds"?  

Here's another quote from the Raptor page (the previous one was the" any hill" class above: 

"0 to 45 km/h in 3 seconds." Performance stats given just like a car right? What more do you need? Except for the non-minor fact that the driver represent 5% of your car's mass, while you are 95% of the mass of you on a skate? 

Nm = Newton meters

I want the info, and i know how to use it to compare boards. The real source of the controversy in this thread is that some of you, builders though you may be, do not.

Ninja edit: change of "many"  to "some". ;-)

I don't understand what's wrong with a comparison video by an independent customer?  If I'm comparing 3 boards doing the exact same thing, you might not get dyno stats but at least you can say for the same weight and at the same place X board will go faster or climb faster than Y board.  Is that not enough?

Well ur speaking about car enthusiast. I have a car and I am a car enthusiast. When my car was bought I didnt put alot of attention wether it can go 0 to 60 in seconds. I dont buy a race car and so its not important. Even if I do I dont think to bother doing that either, since I bought for cool and not to race.

If numbers is so important, why does f1 and car manufacturers still have test drive circuit? They still have test driver and they still implement aeodynamics sensor on test race? Simply because dyno doenst tell all performance. Its just guidance number for experts, indeed. To set new records and to understand how the system work. Youre right in that.

So thats why I encourage you to build one and or buy eboard first. Get them tested in independent test facility like RDW in the Netherlands. That will provide you the solid numbers you need. Do you think I didnt know or contact them earlier? Yes I did and I also contacted Dutch ministry of transportation as well. No matter how many times you test at home, who gona validate that? Who are responsible for the numbers and if its using correct international methodologies.

If you are so deep with building performance board, start by investing. I am also trying to make budget or performance board. You are not the only one thought about that. But before I spend 1000 euro to transportation test facility, I asked my future customer. They said what I have is good enough. So why do I need to bother doing test? Logically this is true.

I also wont rellying data based on members post here if I want to make claims over my longboard performance when I manufacture them. If you are so into it, the steps taken to it is completely a mess. Unless youre again trying to save money on development. But if your attitude towards saving money is build up right here, why should I trust your board when I know its going to be cheap components in the inside.

I also like mellow board so much thats its simple with hub motor. Boosted also very nice boards. They sell thousands without exact numbers claims, they did their own testing. If it sells, it sells. Our board just ressemble their board with better componnents while have the price cheaper. So no doubt it can overperform it.

I am in line with your thoughts, about numbers and calculations and engineering. Thers no doubt about it.

The reason I'm in this thread is because enertion claims their motors better than typical motors from hobbyking.  In fact they even claim hobbyking motor are unsuitable!   There are a couple hobbyking motors, scorpion for sure, that will blow away enertion motors.  They simply are more efficient machines and won't burn up as quickly.   Enertion makes these claims with no real comparisons just a twenty minute video of onloop telling idiots that his are better and they eat it up.  No real information is given throughout twenty minutes, we're just supposed to believe onloop tried them all and has come up with the best, and he's selling it, and it costs double.  No one who watches that will know any better as to what makes one motor better than the other.  If a seller or manufacturer really wants to reveal what their motor can do they will ** reveal what the components and airgap are**.   No surprise there it's the same with anything

: 

Are the windings done with typical multistrand stuff or single strand
What temp can the magnets get to
What strength are the magnets
Are the magnets curved and what is the airgap
How thin are the stator laminations
How big is the motor
How much does the stator and copper weight

These things above determine how powerful a motor is.  Electric airplane hobby guys test the crunk out of their motors using a thrust meters and thermometers and watt meters. It isn't hard to do and since the motors are the same and a skating steep hill simulation can be done. Check out rcgroups.com if you're interested.  It's not a dyno but still can reveal torque abilities if u throw a big enough prop on the motor 

Stator laminate thickness makes a huge difference in efficiency <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/f/fd630a5ba872ef472405aa0d6e3e2bfac118c3d9.jpeg" width="666" height="500"> here you can just see the difference between a .35mm stator laminate and a .2mm<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/1/1953c27fbde024e6b0d0070005ac1149e759847e.jpeg" width="666" height="500">and here u can see different windings.  Thinner multistrand has more resistance and u can't get as much copper in typically and it will be lighter.  These are a 235kv and 200kv motor. 235 ironically with the thinner winding
Other mechanical things such as are there two or three bearings and are they press or slide fit. ...that's about it.  There's no magic aluminum or special steel that is going to help make a motor stronger or more durable. . Every manufacturer used the same aluminum and steel and it works fine and isn't an issue

Having testing equipment is unlikely and informal video demos made by sellers are questionable but what the motors are made of defines it's engineering and its ability.   This is not arguable.  If any motor is able to not burn up give a certain amount of amps it's for a reason, efficiency or higher temp magnets. That's it. 
I went to a lot of trouble to get the best components in the hub motors I had made.  I know what is in them to say the least.  When another seller makes rediculous claims I'll call them on it

It's cool. I bow out of the debate here, because my questions have been answered, more deeply than I had anticipated:

Not only do any of the builders here **not** have a dyno or other testing rig, but many elements of the community, Onloop included, don't see a need for such a method of analysis, nor for more complete or detailed claims other than the customary single number for max speed, range and climbing ability. 

I actually love watching comparison and performance videos and will keep doing it. I totally have nothing against it, I just think there's a better way...so you don't need to hope that someone somewhere decided to film the exact two or three boards that you wanted to compare.

I've purposely stayed out of this discussion, as I see both sides of the argument.

Take the information we gather from cars using dyno testing.

One of those being mpg. That number means NOTHING. I bought a Subaru Impreza a few years ago. Was rated for 32 mpg city and I'm lucky to get 18 mpg city. I met someone with the upgrade version of my car, the Impreza wrx. Besides many other upgrades, the most noticeable difference is that it has turbo. That should kill the mpg. It's only rated at 22 mpg city, while the guy I talked to said he got more like 15 mpg city.

At the end of the day, these numbers are calculated on dynos, in perfect conditions. These conditions don't exist in the real world, so like @onloop said, these numbers are meaningless.

That's not to say the numbers don't indicate something about the mpg I should expect to get, and for that reason, I don't think they are completely useless, but you can't use them to justify buying a specific car.

Now again, I think you could get some useful info. But many data points are useless.

Ive been stalking your build @Hummie and your claims are pretty solid. True well at some points we all have to agree that manufacturers can claim anything. Thats why some means something some dont. But yea if we want to engineer and improve, that numbers are very important otherwise you wont know what to expect next.

Anyway I am arranging some test with the test facility once my build is complete. Not sure if speed test or torque test is a part of it, I think its only electromagnetic radiation as I recall. But guys I definitely look up into the numbers if there are. However I also want to see side by side comparison video. Thats how the numbers and performance can relate.

What test are u doing?  For magnetism testing u can get an LR meter that measures inductance.  For 20$!  Really cool tool.  See if there are motor shorts as well as reveal kv and if all the phases have equal inductance.
I think it would be nice to use a thrust tool that the plane guys use.  Add a giant prop and pull many amps at as slow a speed as possible and see what heat it hits.  But almost none of the sellers/manufacturers reveal the temp the magnets get to so could be a bunch of ruined motors when things start getting above 80c

It's a mandatory test to get a vehicle running free on a public road and it's a MUST rule by the Dutch government. This test will need to be executed by a trusted and or appointed test facility that will make a valid report that this electric motor will not caused any disruptions and risk to the public. Theres nothing about speed and torque, but yea not sure if they gona use dynamometer to do this.

But really I think we could just ask this number back to the company / factories who produces them. Like you @Hummie who produces own motor should do the test to check the kv and performance. This should have been done by the chinese companies as well tbh. But again even if they show me their numbers, I will take them as peanuts. Some real test needs to be done recorded within video with some comparison.

@Hummie btw do you have / know how to disassemble turnigy SK3 motor? I am curious whats in the inside to compare with the chinese hub motor i have.

Not gonna lie, I was expecting you to use the one that you made. I must say I was pleasantly surprised by the fact that you were able to use a bike dyno. :slight_smile: 

From what I could tell that was a really good testing method, the only thing I would nit pick about (and it would help you anyways) would be that instead of having a person hold down the board, as that could affect the traction and therefore the horsepower reading, to either have some weights to put on there, or to strap it down to keep it against the drum. I would imagine that would help greatly with the issue that you were having with the mono drive.

Also what you were talking about with the other guy near the end, getting additional info out of the vesc. It would be interesting to see how (if at all) that would affect the HP calculations.

All over 10/10 great video :smile:

thank you @onloop for doing the dyno test. It doesn't tell you everything, but those results sound too perfect. bb with those little motors should have the least horsepower of the 3, bigger motor mono should have more horsepower than bb, but less than the 2. And the 2 r-spec's should give more horsepower than the mono. So the numbers aren't completely useless. They confirm more or less what we already knew, but couldn't put scientific proof behind.

@onloop LEGIT!
I really like how you went and got this done. People were asking about it, so you stepped up and checked it out.  Dyno testing won't give you everything, but it does give you a good point of reference to work with. Now when you compare these reference numbers with "real world" performance, it will give really helpful feedback when tuning. It is not exactly the numbers themselves that mean something, but learning how those numbers directly affect real world performance. 
I used to rebuild and hot rod Hondas and Toyotas. My buddy Corry owns a shop in town, so we were able to Dyno test after each mod we did. Exhaust install...Dyno test...Header upgrade....Dyno...ECU mod...Dyno...It was really cool to see what was making extra torque and BHP and what was pretty much not worth the extra $$$$. Dyno gave us good reference to see if our tuning was heading the right direction. 
Kudos for posting, dude!!

Hey @onloop, take this post as an more illustrative response to the question you asked in your post on speaking out or shutting up. It got a little heated here too, names were called, but I did change your mind and good things happened. People love the video, and I saw that you even posted it in that infamous thread to show that you do in fact do unbiased, objective testing.

> And is really fun to do this stuff too.... i love my job

Added bonus...you admit to having fun doing it.

Agree to disagree...this is a forum after all, not a support group, right?

Back to your video: HP is only one of the things a dyno can measure. I want more. I want to know what simulated load any given board is capable of moving, I want to see who accelerates fastest in a given time with a simulated load, I want to see max speeds at peak voltage, I want to see max speeds at 50% SOC, I want to see who has the strongest braking/shortest braking distance with a simulated load, I want to see the max grade of a downhill that your brakes can take you to a complete stop, I want to see torque at low speeds, I want to see torque at high speeds, I want, I want, I want. Sorry to be so needy.

I agree!  A datasheet with all of this data would be awesome. I always bought t-motors (slightly expensive motors) for my quadcopters because they had a page of data on the motor performance. This allowed for more comprehensive system planning. 

See the example below:

Nice contribution, Harpie. I especially like the last line of the graph, which explains testing conditions. If you want to get super techincal, you might define intial/room temperature, but that's nice.

@lox897, if you don't care about being able to compare boards and prove or disprove claims using controlled testing, why did you click on the topic? I'm willing to bet that not he, but his company pays for this forum. $99 a month is not an unreasonable business expense for the many additional purposes he uses the forum for: e-skate promotion, education, advertisement for Enertion and Enertion after-market support. That's good business sense. There's also a bit of negative advertisement when his speaking his mind crosses the line into personal insults, but I think he's adult enough to defend himself.

I'd love insight into your respective workshops, but comments like yours make this place feel like a kindergarten playground instead. Yes, we know the ball is yours, Onloop, the forum is good so let's keep playing.

I really dont know what is your goal honestly. So much data for what? I recall you wanted to create a business your self? Why not start investing buying enertion motors and other motors in the market and do your homework? Seller could say what every they want. I have my business I say anything I want, valid or not valid. The consequences are in in the business, but as consumer / end user, you are the one buying. If you can be cheated and you don't know, company has no disadvantage over it. Only end consumer fell the pain.

You've been here for a very long time. The last time you posted no one even replied. Data is so important for the business, but not all of them for the market. ie: who the fuk care about ip65 and or kv or c rating. All common people do not understand this at all and you want to tell this people this code in their face and expect to buy? I bet you not.

Please stop attacking and jacking replies for shit. I know you want your data, but no one is going to shove their ass to do your laundry work. Its your laundry anyway, enertion and others are selling anyway, why the hell people need to start collecting things for you? You like Mellow, then be patient and wait for it. Understand their data. Build your own compare your self. Be contributive instead!

My goal was in my OP. It would have been more sensible for you to go back and read that, instead of wasting time reading my profile and post history, then angling to insult me. 

What would I do once I have some numbers that let me rate and rank boards? I'd use that data to simply buy or build the one that I like best, as you so "fuk shit jack" eloquently suggested. 

The "common folk" are ALREADY having IP65, KV, MaH, aH, Wh (not C rating though) being thrown in their faces. I agree with you when you say they do not understand this at all.

You misunderstand my exploration; I am interested in numbers that would eventually describe the physical limitations and performance in a way that anyone can understand. I do this already when I loan my board to a newbie, telling him to brake well in advance of an intersection, because I know it's not something he could estimate from his experience.

At no time did I ask Onloop to do it. He protested strongly as you did, then went and did it anyway, and then roundly congratulated himself on it. Good on him. Once again, spend your time more wisely and read the OP to convince yourself.

Please don't be negative. I am a full-time electronic engineer where tables and graphs are some of the highlights of my day. If I get my hands on vescs one day (and some time) I will gladly throw together a motor testing rig with some arduinos controlling the vescs and logging some sweet data. This could also be handy in testing different software modes on the vesc.

I am not trying to be negative, I'm also supporting this thread. I personally did videos, test, opening up a motor and review them. But if members are asking other members to do it, arguing while not taking serious actions, only keeps on replying. This I do not agree. Now what is left is do is build the rig, do the test, post your data thats how you support this thread.

Good job @laurnts . If everyone wanted a dyno test, I am sure @onloop would do it for everyone. But if it is just one person, why should he go out and pay money (I assume it isn't free) just so you can get the test. He has got a business to run. I am not being harsh to you guys, I am just saying you need to look somewhere else for dyno testing. 

Peace.

How would i interpretate the data to get the motor specs only using the real time data of the bldc tool. In my mind, i would need a baseline motor, where all the specs are known

Only time I've ever seen anything like that it had one motor bigger than the other, you run the big motor at known speeds and then record the output on the other motor/generator and it will reveal what the little
motor is capable of

Maybe if you short two of the "other motor" phases and then connect it to the one on the bldc too using your contraption, the "other motor" will give a consistent resistance.

Ah, I can see how you thought that. Nope, I was sort of screaming at the heavens in general. 

Although, since Jason himself said, with respect to that dyno testing session, that he had fun doing it and totally loves his job, it wouldn't have been presumptuous. 

Nah, my request was to anyone out there who not only builds, but tweaks and/and or measures for comparing with others or for performance enhancement. I'd love to read a study or figures like those consumer reports for washing machines, giving a line up of different builds, even and especially DIY.

Thats a cool setup. You should already be able to measure some amount of information. A bigger 'dyno' motor will help extend this information to the limits of the motor under test (MUT). 

I will order some vescs soon, so i am not yet familiar with what is available on its communication lines. Nevertheless, it should be feasable to get voltage, current and rpm from each vesc connected respectfully to the dyno and the MUT. An arduino can log these parameters while controlling the pwm inputs to both controllers.

From here you can devise all kinds of measurements. For example: maximum torque for different rpm values. This could help you optimise your pulley setup. You could also measure efficiency vs rpm to find the optimal working point of your system for maximizing battery life.

I would start by generating a constant braking power on the dyno and then varying the throttle from 0 to 100. Repeat this for a range of load conditions while logging the rpm and power going into the MUT. This already would give some neat information. 

I am not a motor expert, hence the interrest to experiment. Theres alot of possibilities in what we can measure. Some measurements might not be helpfull, others might take the hobby to the next level.

Are u going to use two motors set up with two vescs?  Maybe u could run it off one battery? 

If you have two vesc running both those motors then you'd be able to do a lot of measuring of regen under different loads.  Maybe that's your plan
