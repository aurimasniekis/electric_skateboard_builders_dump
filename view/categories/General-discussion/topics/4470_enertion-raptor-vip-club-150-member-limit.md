This is an exclusive club only open to the first 150 raptor owners (at 94 currently), it rewards the early adopters with an upgraded warranty, wholesale prices on the latest technology releases and the latest news on product developments before anyone else.

- The warranty upgrade is a 12-month instant replacement warranty covering all parts on the raptor.
- New technology will mostly be related to batteries, drive trains & hand controllers.

As a Raptor VIP Club member you will be given the opportunity to provide critical feedback to help enertion build better products. You will be able to directly email Jason with product questions & support inquiries. You also have a chance to be selected as a beta tester for future complete eboards we plan to release.

This is from what Evolve did with the GT.  They sent beta boards all over the world for testing for a month per person.  Which I think is better than what Enertion were doing which is in house testing.  In fairness Evolve could afford to do that.  The deal I believe was for the testers to buy the production GT,  discounted possibly.  So if Enertion do that ill be the first to put my hand up as a beta tester as I did ask them early on about it.  @onloop.

Exactly, I've been so jealous of the GT testers. But also really angry that Jeff couldn't find any decent reviewers that are not biased to have a go at the board for a month and let them make **good** videos (once it officially launched). So far most of the beta testers have made some decent ride videos, but they lack serious information and the testing they've done is poor. They need an impartial third party...hopefully I can be that for Enertion in the future :)

@Mr_Mahal The testers were Evolve loyal customers hence why the poor vids and reviews. Its going to be biased. They want the riders real world feedback to assist with the development of the production versions. Your videos may be less biased as yourve owned or going to own other brands. 

I can say that 1 of the GT beta versions remote died,  1 motor started to make grinding noise due to covers rubbing with  fixing.  Then both motors died alltogether. Lucky Evolve make those backpacks  so its easier to walk home. I was still riding my Raptor home.

I assume this was the time you went to see it first? That's why beta testers are so valuable : p But yeah I know they are loyal customers. It just doesn't help entice people not within their eco system to join in when you can obviously see the bias and almost none of them ever talk about the cons.

I think its all on hold for now as baby probably arrived. I believe theres still room for the VIP.  Enertion cant make or distribute them quick enough. I wonder whether the ship has left the harbour. With the masses lining up for Boosted 2.0. Evolve GT and bamboo.  Glad I have my Raptor though. Might be some more sales on in the future.

Its all about timing. Raptors are there and hopefully vid like @Photorph will open up the Brand as I still dont think anyone has any idea how good this thing is. Its a weapon.

Heres one from NIK

My channel is called electric longboard.  

https://m.youtube.com/channel/UC6w5jwWeYy_l0OGjYqVL1Ow

I have the raptor and I'm going to test it before I do a review, so I won't be posting a review right away.  I may post small videos of the tests I'm doing.  I already posted one, it was literally my first time stepping on the raptor and just like a 1 minute ride I did since it was getting dark.  I really love it so far!  They must have done something different because this throttle response is excellent... But I need to ride it more, I've only ridden like a couple of mins total so far.  

I need to buy some tools to make sure all the nuts and bolts are tight.  I also need to buy a new camera, my GoPro is working fine but my main camera (canon 80d) broke..  So I'm waiting on a few things and to do testing before I post a full review and comparison with boosted and the LHB.  I'd say in 2 weeks the full review and comparison will be up, in the meantime I'll post some clips here and there.

Okay I have a pretty scary issue with my raptor not sure if this is the place to get help but as I'm accelerating the board with 87% batt and then the board cuts out and the battery display turns off but the switch is still on. I can turn it off and back on and it comes back and still reads 87% and as soon as I go to accelerate hard or semi hard it shuts off again... a few days ago I was drag racing with it down to 35% batt and it held up fine. Any ideas? I'm 185lbs and have the raptor dual that I received last week with a few missing screws for the lid, no threadlocker on the 3 aluminum to carbon fibre screws for one of the mounts which I corrected as soon as I received it and the board also came in two packages labeled skateboard with the full price and so I paid the full dutties and taxes for both board + controller twice once for just a board and once for just the controller. so that sucked and now this... help?

Let me know what turns out as a solution. I know it has something to do with the safety voltages you put in your vesc settings, but I haven't managed to solve this problem.
Push starts and moderate acceleration is how I do it now. I only seem to have it starting from standstill...

ok cool glad I'm not the only one but yes push starts and gentle acceleration is what works for now. I just wish I knew what to change on the VESC.

@El_Cid Could you also state which type of CAPS you have on your vesc? Mine is one big of 3300µF. Could have something to do with it as well I guess...
```

---
## \#34 Posted by: El_Cid Posted at: 2016-07-28T16:38:38.113Z Reads: 108

```
Hey so between my two VESCs I also have a single 3300µF cap I have also verified that each vesc is only pulling 25A max from the battery and even then with a fully charged battery if I accelerate anything more than a gentle roll it will shut off the battery and wont turn back on unless i switch it off and on again. I also tried to set the vescs to only pull 15A each and even then it still did this... It didnt do this when I first got it. the first few days it preformed beautifully and i rode it with confidence.. now i'm scared to push it too hard across an intersection because it might shut off on me half way through...

Allright that's usefull info.
My board is running again. Just the issue with full throttle.
Which like you, I didn't have the first couple of weeks. But I'll be playing with vesc settings to see if it's related. I'm hoping my warranty vesc has different caps so I can test that as well ! I'll keep you posted.
