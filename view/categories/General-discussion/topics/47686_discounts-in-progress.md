I wasn't able to find a thread other than the Cyber Monday thread about on going discounts, so I figured I'd start one.

I just saw this one from .  They have $20 off 6374 motors, figured there was someone out there that could use it.  Info below...

nope, just got a discount in my email that I didn't know if a lot of people got, so I figured I'd share.  

On another note...since you've never posted a build, only been here 3 months, it seems you speak a little above your pay grade.  I want to share that 80/20 rule with you.  It essentially means that 80% of the effect is caused by 20% of the cause.   We can further extrapolate this to mean that knowledge and expertise comes from 20% education and 80% practice.  

Try getting some more practice before you voice opinions about every damned thing.

Chill bro. I am not damning things. üç§ I never posted a build thread, yes, but it‚Äôs not like I am telling everyone what to do on their builds. üç™

That's kinda what you are doing.  Hell, maybe I'm wrong, but it seems to me that you enjoy correcting people on the finer points of construction, the things that are almost always preference rather than performance related.  I'm not trying to bag on you, just ease up a bit, you will get a lot more cooperation and learn a lot more...that's what we are all doing here right?

all he said (in this thread anyways) is that if they were 6355 he would get them...i dont see the big deal.
Granted i haven't looked at his post history and rate etc but i dont see why that  would even be relevant in this situation

Yes you was harsh with him but I think it was necessary. Since he is on the forum he always would do some unecessary comment. Pretending he always know better.
Many have tried to prove him wrong but he wouldn‚Äô listen and be passive aggressive. Anyway don‚Äôt apologize maybe this time he understood.

@mmaner do you or anyone else have a feel for the quality/reliability or general goodness of this kit?

@torqueboards have you done a bunch of testing?

I love a good deal but I hate broken or fiddly parts.

@deucesdown it's all in 7075 Aluminum. I'd say if you have problem with bolting on set screws. Don't get it but other then that. They are solid. There are in total 3 support brackets and 1 support bar.

We're just looking to get some stuff off the shelf to make more space for new stuff.

I was in Nashville this weekend, there's a store in Opry Mills called SUn & Ski that has caliber 2 trucks for $29 and, more importantly, has bushing packs for $0.92 a set.  I also got some Triple 8 Slide Gloves for $14.
