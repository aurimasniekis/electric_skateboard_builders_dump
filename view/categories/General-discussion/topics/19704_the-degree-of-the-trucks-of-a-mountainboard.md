I wanted to know about the decks used for mountainboard. Whether 30-35 degree is needed or can a 15 degree bend where the trucks go do just fine? Anywhere i can get this info would be highly appreciated links and pics encouraged lol

I read somewhere that the trucks turn better at (bigger/smaller) angles. Not sure which,  but will try to find where I read that from.

I posted something similar this week with regard to skate trucks.: http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/mounting-of-trampa-skate-trucks-on-flat-deck/19637

If you look on the Trampa site, you will find some information. It looks like 35 seems to be the standard for mountainboards. They have a couple of 15 decks, that they actually fit mainly with skate trucks.
I have a Scrub Regolith that I use for kite landboarding, and the angle is limited, with spring trucks. Not sure it makes a big difference, but your center of gravity is by essence lower.

You can use skate trucks for MTB, but it ain't that comfortable.

The tkp extra long skate trucks are for a deck with 15° nose and tail.
Spring trucks need a 35° nose and tail.
Mbs and trampa sell both of them
