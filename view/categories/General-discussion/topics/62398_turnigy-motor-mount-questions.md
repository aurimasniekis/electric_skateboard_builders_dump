Was looking at buying the Turnigy motor mounts from HobbyKing: https://hobbyking.com/en_us/motor-mount-5.html but wasn't sure of a couple things. Firstly, will these fit on the TB218mm trucks? I plan on running dual 6374 but don't feel like spending $60US per mount for the TB stuff. Secondly, will the mounts fit 63xx size motors?
Another one: has anyone managed to fit the new SK8 6374 motors on TB218mm trucks in dual? I know the can for these is longer than 74mm so wasn't sure if they would fit or if I should step down to 6364 motors
