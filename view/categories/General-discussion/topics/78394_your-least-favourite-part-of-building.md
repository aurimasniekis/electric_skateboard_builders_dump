I for one hate soldering :slight_smile:  Even with helping hands, wires don't stay together. There is always too much or too little solder. Even with ventilation, the flux and rosin smoke gives me a headache haha

Aligning enclosure and deck holes is also PIA.

On the other hand, I really enjoy the mechanical aspects. Like aligning pulleys, motor mounts etc etc

I wish I had a friend who enjoyed what I don't like and vice versa. Would be perfect lol

Stuffing wires places. I have the habit of leaving wires a bit long for "servicing" and build changes. Really just ends up being annoying when I try to close the lid.

When you get new parts for a build but you can't make anything  because you dont have all of the parts so they just sit on your desk... and you just think abiut how fun it is going to be to actually ride it... :frowning:

now i¬¥m waiting the snow to come back to have some fun with studded wheels or snow chains. 
and the nice thing on the winter, you can push your vesc to the totall max of your battery output limit... last time i was driving, the pcb temperature was higher on the beginning or the ride than when i came home :rofl:

I have a similar issue.

I ride it off in the basement (parking garage) then after I get on the elevator, I ride down the carpeted hallway on my floor to dry the wheels off.

Whenever they get stiff and squeaky.  Last winter I had to hammer one bearing off the axle.  It all depends.  They can be fine for months then there's one nasty spot that full of salt and water and I hit it just right and it gets everything then within a couple days the bearings start going to trash.  It's worse if you set the board down and don't ride it.  If you keep riding it, it seems to be not be quite as bad, but still bad.

fibreglass, anything to do with it, from handling, cutting or opening packages that have fibreglass in there. 

It's got better recently as I now wear gloves and use the vacuum cleaner before handling but I still somehow end up with the itches.

Totally worth it in the long run as nothing beats a fibreglass enclosure but still annoying.
