I didn't know e-tox had these! I saw it said 70a, how soft is that? Is that comparable to the yellow dampas?

I always compair them stability wise something between yellow and red dampas bit with a way smaller turning radius.

Gosh, I don't know. Hmm... I guess someone who thought that because they sound similar and do the same thing that people would get confused? 
I mean, c'mon, that could be anybody.

Tempted to get a set of these. I'm using springs with custom poured 50A dampas but was wondering how will these feel. Anyone used both springs and Elastomeres able to give some input?

You say to use elastomers in the front ?,...  isn't it the back that causes wobbles

Care to elaborate on this, sounds very interesting? 

I'm running elastomers in the back, springs and drilled yellow dampas on the front, gives me a nice mix of stability, damping, and reasonable amount of turning depending on how much I bias my weight balance. I'm a light weight, 55kg, and springs with dampas didn't work for me, same with elastomers all around, couldn't get a good turn. If anything I'd like to reduce the diameter of the elastomer on the rear, maybe it could be turned on a lathe, but as I said I'm probably lighter than most folk. Either way having experimented with all the parameters the trampa trucks offer, I couldn't see myself not using elastomers in the future, really transformed the ride for me.

Are Elastomers easier to lean and turn than with springs and the yellow dampas? I'm on the 50A ones and find that i can't lean and turn as easily as with my caliber truck build. I run my boards relatively on soft bushings.

Here's the thread to the 50A dampas.

Elastomers are easier to turn than springs with yellow dampas, trying to illustrate it here but hard to show, but it takes more force to initiate the same deflection in the front with springs and yellow dampas(center drilled out by 5mm), than it does with elastomers on the rear![Dampas_elasotomers|592x499](upload://dtedcF7S03ty7kEXD8hyiStq0fR.jpeg) 

And BTW, speed wobbles start at the front, unless your reversing into bumps, just amplified by the rear.. que channel truck debate :popcorn:
