I was browsing Muirskate and noticed that they now have the 29" Jet Potatoe (2016 version) in stock. Since there has been so much interest in @RunPlayBack's [thread](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/runplayback-29-jet-spud-deck-single-carvon-v2-hub-motor-space-cell-vesc/1050) and @whitepony's [beautiful board with the bindings](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/carbon-jet-spud-freebord-bindings-single-vesc-10s3p-lg-hg2/5805), I thought others might be interested. Here's the link to MuirSkate ...

And, they also have the 33" Potatoe which you can find here ...

ah, so this must be the successor of the discontinued spud then? might be even cooler because the spud really has a MASSIVE concave and the potato looks a little more moderate! :slight_smile:

Yes, I believe it is the replacement to the Spud. Lovely looking board, and in a really tight package.

Nice find! Looks pretty much the same as the original except for the graphics?
