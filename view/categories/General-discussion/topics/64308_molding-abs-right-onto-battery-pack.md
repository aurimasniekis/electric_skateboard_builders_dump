do you guys think it would be alright to mold an abs sheet right over my battery pack? I was thinking about putting some 8th inch foam on top of the pack to protect it from the heat. Making a mold would be a pain/I dont wanna go buy wood. this seems like a good way to get a super accurate mold

You would not want to do this as there would be a lot of heat buildup and the box wouldnâ€™t be flat.

Well I mean I don't want it to be flat, I want it to be the shape of the battery and bms

Well if that is what you are going for then I guess go ahead with your method. I would however add about a 1/4in spacer on the side of the batteries just to gain a little air flow to keep temps in check.

Yep I agree, also adding something will help keep the heat directly off the battery

Just use Styrofoam or cardboard, why play with fire if you can avoid it.
