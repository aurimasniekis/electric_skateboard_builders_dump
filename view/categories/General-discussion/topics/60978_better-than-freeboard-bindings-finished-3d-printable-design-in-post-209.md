Given the events that took place in the Freeboard bindings thread, I’m inclined to open a discussion and start working towards a lighter, more comfortable design with the community. There are a lot of people more qualified to take a stab at this than I am, but I’m in need of another project anyways and welcome any input. So - what are we looking for?

You talkin' 'bout Foot Hookers? :grinning: Carbon fiber and aluminum construction= lightweight, more appealing aesthetic design, some way to mount optional battery gauge on Hooker of choice, more ergonomic and padded design, easier angle and height adjustment mechanisms, and that's all I've got right now.

I certainly wouldn’t mind a more comfortable design, but I’d settle for just a lightweight version. The current freeboard design does have room for a battery meter.![image|375x500](upload://lXxph1YMyVOyZZSWwI1Z3Hd5QPI.jpeg)![image|374x500](upload://wmv3uaX91pBunva44NbbuaNV7vG.jpeg)

* A short ratcheting pole to adjust height, which also allows the angle to be set, or threaded bar to rotate to desired angle/height
 * Choice of mount plate- all 4 skate truck holes or tri-mount incorporating only two of the skate holes and third hole further back drilled into deck
 * Ability to ratchet off the foot assembly part to switch between natural/goofy quickly
* padding inside of the hooker
* optional OLED/power/cable management

Diy - 3d print / threaded bar/resourcefulness and inclusivity for all

With the possibility of someone sending me a binding to scan and upload, I tried to get some time in the school shop. Long story short - we don't have a 3d scanner anymore.

In light of that, I've used my preliminary cad skills to start working on my own binding system, heavily based off of freebord bindings to start and then I'm sure it'll evolve from there. So far I've got the lower portion and fitting piece designed, with a 3 bolt system that allows vertical adjustment and some extra long screw slots in a semi-circle formation allowing for rotational adjustment. I'll take some measurements of my shoes tonight and get working on the top half tomorrow.

So has there been any updates on this?

Still hard to believe nobody has come up with a design or solution on how to make similar function bindings.. or whoever did it has kept it to themselves..

I imagine it shouldnt be that difficult (to come up with working design) and then print it with strong filament and in worst case, reinforce it with steel bars or other reinforcement

Otherwise it is a shame only open type bindings are the Freeboard ones..

I’ve got a working model ready for 3D print but it’s super angular since my cad experience is limited. It works though, I can get around to sharing it tomorrow. 

If anyone with more cad experience or bindings on hand wants to take the file and smooth it over I’d be more than open to it.

Sharing to the 3D masters
napkin, but don’t have time to make somethng better than ths right now

You have a post maybe 70mm tall on legs (in pic it’s a base) Instead imagine having the base as one of akhlut’s x-things mounted onto the skate truck holes.

There are 3 lines of ratchet notches(2 may be better) running up to the top allowing you to have a foot mount which has a large ring which goes onto the rachet pole, the ring would have 2/3ratchet clips built into it.

Depress the clips which have springs in them of course and you can swivel the mount regular to goofy and also adjust for height

@banjaxxed  Idea about a metal rod, which makes the binding adjustable looks good.. 

Though, do u have any ideas from what material to make the actual binding? Would it be possible to bypass 3d printing at all and use something already existing?

Same problem im facing with mud guards.. would be cool if something was easy to be made with existing materials and resources.. otherwise it goes back to 3d modeling and 3d printing once again

I could make a rough paper projection of what it could be.. but what we really need here, is exact dimensions and the form / mounting structure..

@banjaxxed I also imagine something, where u can insert steel/metal bars into, to make it more sturdy/durable, as im not sure how strong regular abs/pla plastic might be.. 

As these are the most regular used ones, since PETG takes some tinkering and not all beginner level printers can print it decently, I guess..

As far I know freeboard bindings do that just fine.. check some @okp videos

Not sure, if @Riako uses s2 bindings a lot, but if u do, can u comment on ease of use, when jumping with these bindings?

Personally, that would be part of the goal - create bindings, with which u can make jumps while also be able to get out of them easily and not glue your feet to them..

I will post some of the original S2 Binding pictures here..

I think what we need here is the same 'platform' - Adjustable metal 'base', which supports the 'L' type structure and holds it in place.

Seems, like some pre-machined or close to that metal parts might be needed.. Hard to say whenever metal part can be replaced with plastic ones here..

---

I even found a guy saying slipping of feet occurs, so he came up with a solution to make the bindings more 'sticky' / locked in:

https://adrenalinefueled.wordpress.com/2010/07/09/s2-binding/

--

I even found the metal plate for sale seperately here:

http://www.iboardnz.com/store/product/33/s2-baseplate

So, in theory we could use the original plate (if same purchase is possible in usa / eu shops) and then just 3d model / print out own 'feet holder' part..

Dont want to sound cheap but I see this as the easy way to chop off 40$ off the total price.

I assume wont be really viable for outsourcing 3d printing to someone commercially but for these who have access to 3d printers, final cost should be determined based on how much filament it might take..

Either way.. the math here is that plastic part costs more, if the shipping cost of just the metal plate inside the user base continents, doesnt make buying the complete kit more worthwhile..

Thank you for posting these.
It seems like the topper can be 3d printed. And the base part createvely designed.

Their base part is a simple metal sheet, laser cut and then bent around 90deg. Very simple.

So what is the main issue with these?
Is it the price or something that they don't deliver? Something that you wished was there but isn't?

Looking for the most info here.

For me.. it is just price mostly, the rest of mountainboard bindings can be sourced for close to 15-20 usd, I think. Not saying new condition in all cases but decently lower than 60usd + shipping..

Secondly, I think the design might offer some disadvantages, as it does seem rather open.. Here I see the opportunity to make it somewhat more 'sticky' / locked in, than the original design.. 

At least that was the issue the guy on the website was tackling, that the feet got out anyway.

---

So yeh.. if this was 3d printable.. in lets 1-2 days time and plate bought seperately / machined or 3d printed, would save some money on shipping cost + item price, for sure..

I understand 60usd might not be much for many better / deeper pocketed esk8 builders.. but non the less, if it can be made on your own and possibly better while also saving some coin.. why not

---

To me it is mostly about availability.. and ~70 Eur for bindings alone, definitely is not the area u want to spend extra money on, if some of that coin can be used for better battery / motors, for example.

unlikely, it would shatter in seconds unless you CF skin or at the very least bath it in epoxy.  Nothing is gonna be good though unless its injection molded or metal.

also, not correct.  it may be laser cut and bent on a break, but its almost 6mm thick so its not sheet metal.

I'm not trying to b e argumentative but you gotta have more info before you make assumptions like that.

The reason we don't buy from Freebord is that they are assholes.  The dont like electric skateboards, they were really rude in public to @okp about an IG post, they said they didn't wanna sell to us.

Good feedback @mmaner

I guess Freeboard distributor hate against esk8'ers is another reason to create something on our own..

Though from what u are telling it starts to sound like this wont be an easy job at all.. and someone would need to take up for it, make the models and create everything out of metal or sturdy plastic (possibly machine job involved)

Or a solution needs to be made, onto how to create sturdy enough 'Top plate' to withstand the forces and other punishment it might take.

A 2 piece model milled from aluminum would be better than the 1 piece using a brake to bend it, the bend is what makes it junk.  Im working on something but it's gonna be a bit, covered up at work right now plus testing a new drive system and a new ESC.

Of course, I'm basing only on pictures, never seen this thing live.

I disagree on the topper though. I never meant to copy it as is, but adapt to 3d printing with it's pluses and minuses.

Just in case a few more pictures and looks like @Riako was onto something a long time ago (2016 thread by whitepony on endless sphere)

 ![Buttons8|500x375](upload://9xFrRG6Rls9ZEodrYc20KVNJoYl.jpeg) 

Also one more angle of original S2 bindings:
![completeDaBlues|570x308](upload://kztnkYvQhT7RChR4V4CcnXwZUbd.jpeg)

---

Also found out original S2 baseplates is 17 USD / single piece (on website I opened).. 

So ordering 2 sets of plates alone is no good, if whole kit can be got for 60 usd + shipping..

So not sure how this applies to local distributors but seems like it wont be a way to go anyways..  (+ mentioned hate and disinterest from themselves against esk8 in general..)

---

And last but not least..

Seeing these parts, makes me think making it out of metal is the right way to go.. maybe these stock parts can even be modified to be used as bindings..

That's interesting about the use of plasti dip, although I would spray it on only where I want it instead of actually dipping it. That stuff is tough, but I'm surprised that it actually stays put with your foot sliding in and out. I'm going to try this soon and will let you know how it goes.

This is veeery first try.
Just rough dimensions and assembly idea. (printing now and see the result)

The idea to connect it to the base is with 3 bolts and carbon plate spreading the stresses (both sides). This way the bolts will not stress the printed part (I will run FE later)

For now I'm going with the concept of the original bindings and the base plate is flat sticking out (this may change)
![bind1%20v2|690x325](upload://18A27Qt41dZpMsLB7z0iugODIEq.png) ![bind1%20v2_2|690x325](upload://iPmT8F2Ce0MInA2nTh0T9MpHajF.png) 

I have some additional questions:
1. Does it use the truck mounting hardware or the holes are drilled wherever is convenient?
2. The original base plate, aluminum or steel?

[quote="mmaner, post:64, topic:60978"]
the bend is what makes it junk.

I'm curious as to why?
Does it bend outside when you ride?
Other stuff that I'm missing?

The original base plate is steel, a very low grade of steel.  The truck mounting hardware is used to fasten the base late to the deck.  

The bend uses a lot of space but doesn't serve any purpose other than to provide the angle.  It's a waste in service to cheap costs.

If you dont have rotational adjustment in the top bit that means you also have to adjust the bottom bracket too to accomodate regular/goofy swaps other wise when you swap the bindings will make your feet turn inwards instead of outwards.

This is the rough model of what I'm thinking, combining milled aluminum parts and a 3 printed binding.  The binding itself will need some sort of strengthening, like an epoxy bath or CF wrap or something.  I just don't see any 3d printed filament lasting under the kind of stresses we would put on it.

Guys, thank you all for the inputs.

Just to understand the procedure: suppose I want to use one of these, so I replace the existing hardware with longer bolts and screw this on top? Using bigger washer I suppose?

Could existing users measure the following: 
1. The height of the vertical metal part.
2. The spacing between two adjustment holes - basicaly the resolution of the vertical adjustment.
3. The width of the vertical metal part.

Freebords site lists the weight as 1lb for the whole set, is this the case? Is it considered a lot?

So, this can proceed in two ways:
1. Either do a variation of the existing bindings with identical basic design and adjust to 3d printing/aluminum base.
2. Another idea is to use vertical pole made out of carbon. Will need redesign of the base plate, still manageable. Will greatly reduce the weight! (Honestly this is more interesting, as variations already exist)

What do you say?

@Mobutusan asked in another thread if we're planning anything in this area.

I can understand the attraction, but it's not an area for which I have anything new planned in the near future.  You never know though...  If enough people want something then we listen.  But for us the demand would need to be in the thousands not hundreds.

We did something like this back in the day - circa 2002 on a kids board called the Ambush Scout.  
No good pics on hand unfortunately...
![Ambush%20Scout|601x500](upload://aoXfG0i1av75aq6CSv5LcUDumeg.jpeg) ![Ambush%20Scout_1|300x285](upload://a7BNVbIaZNeQUOCaTkpxhOBI791.jpeg) 

As far as design input goes it seems like what you're planning here is basically right.  The challenge I found was finding the right balance between functionality and comfort.  

If you just want a bit of extra "security" then I'd focus on something small closer to the toe edge of the board like a glorified foot stopper so it doesn't hurt the top of your foot when your heel lifts a little when you do a toe side turn.

If you want to actually get your board off the ground you need to come up close to the ankle (centerline of board), but it can be quite uncomfortable there due to the rigidity required from the design, so lots of padding is key in my opinion (ergonmics can't do it all).  Just do a bunch of 3D printed protos because the balance between comfort and functionality is much easier to feel than envision.  

Of course I'd like to see more people make the jump up to actual bindings like the F5.  Apart from the obvious objective to sell more :partying_face:, I feel they allow you to take your riding to the next level (even on-road).  You can jump up and down curbs and they prevent you from getting thrown inadvertently (rock or braking mishap).  I can certainly understand how they freak out non-mountainboarders though.  For anyone in the habit of jumping off boards in motion bindings are just a bad idea in general.  

Hope that helps...

No not while riding, they keep your feet locked nicely and comfy. I haven't used the F5 without heel straps so far but in general the problem is more when falling. Almost everytime only one foot got released and bad injuries could happen. On a street/urban build I would use bindings only and avoid falling :wink:.

I use heel straps on MTB where I want more control for jumping and extreme leans. Furthermore I often fall with the MTB because of mad riding. I like to have my feet 100% locked so I feel safer (but falling sucks).

For my Urban Carver I still can't decide if I shall use bindings. 

Without bindings you can stand on the deck wherever you want or the stance you like dependent on speed. With bindings it looks bulkier but you can e.g. lift the front for sidewalks or jump up/down. Also it's perfect for carrying. Especially with pneumatics it keeps you on the deck on changing terrains or bumps/cracks/holes instead of the famous flying superman. But without bindings it's easy to bail.

F5 w/o heels is best on the Colab

https://www.colabmtb.com

their mold has 'gas pedals' (where you place your foot is flatter with heel-side concave)

I think the ultimate answer on a cambered deck (e.g., not for Coleman slides) is a hybrid we haven't seen yet - a full binding up-front, S2-type in the back, which would allow me to still hop over stuff, jump to rotate, etc. and still allow me to bring my feet together quickly if/when I bail.

http://www.mktadvisory.com/beach/concept.htm

Another design criteria I just thought of. Whatever the shape of the part going over teh foot is, it needs to be designed in a way whereby a shoelace knot would not get caught in a fall/dismount, basically curl it up at either side so a knot would not get leveraged between the shoe and the mount

Small update

I've spend short time refining the design. For now it seems like 8mm vertical adjustment resolution is looking good with 5M bolts, 4 stops.
Weight (for one unit) less than 200gr (with 100% infill)

The aluminum plate is "hobby grade" CNC friendly, can be made with 3axis machine.

Preliminary analysis shows very low stresses, will refine it in the near future.

I have the carbon tubes available, will print it soon.

Alright, here it is. Basically, it uses a rubber grommet that gets clamped by the bolt and expands to grip onto the hook. This kind of design would be VERY secure if you actually tighten it. It also allows for infinite variability to tune it exactly where you want it to be.

I also used a 1/8th inch plate for the base plate (considering 3/16ths, may be necessary) as this can be easily laser cut very cheaply.

It uses these parts from mcmaster:

https://www.mcmaster.com/93330a671

https://www.mcmaster.com/92210a302

https://www.mcmaster.com/91770a197

https://www.mcmaster.com/9600k102

**The BOM is very cheap for this.** I'm guessing if someone wanted to make a bunch of these (and use up all 100 bolts that come in the box) it'd cost around 15-20 USD each. (wild guess)

The only two custom parts would be the hook (3d printed) and the baseplate (lasered)

I'm also 100% confident in those 1/2 inch thick standoffs.

**Total aluminum mass: 60g**

**Total steel mass: 11.5g**

Plus whatever's 3d printed and the two grommets.

**For the 3d print I would recommend this:**

THICCC shell layers, like 5mm thick. On top and bottom layers too.
Low infil, like 50%. But in a 3d honeycomb (good for all stress directions, see simplify3d for slicer)

I put in literally 0 effort into the actual hook, so someone who actually wants to make this can cad it and post here.

**This is mostly an idea**, but it'd definitely work, I've used systems like this before. I'll let you guys take it from here.

And cmon @banjaxxed , you thought this'd take me a day to source parts? ;) I'm a pro :kissing_heart:

I like that system. It's a completely universal mount, for which you can 3D print any kind of bindings, including something like I [sketched up](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/better-than-freeboard-bindings/60978/33?u=janpom) above, so that you don't need to use a spoon. :laughing:

So now we just need someone to machine the baseplates and we can go home, right?

The bigger we make the 3d printed part (for more foot coverage) the weaker it will be unfortunatley.  I dont expect there to be any problems but in a hard bail they could snap.

I love the latest design but I think we could easily get away with slightly more foot coverage.  I can print in Nylon or glass fibre reinforced Nylon or even carvon reinforced nylon if we needed to for extra strength!

I just guessed at the angle of contact on my initial design and it didn't match any of my shoes by a lot. So, I took some measurements and tried to add adjustability to the angle for varying shoe types. Rather than the adjustment by vertical screw I was thinking of a wedge concept where you tighten it's grip by working your foot further in to your liking. The base is currently PETG and the plate is TPU with like a 15 percent infill that gives a hard rubber feel while still flexy enough it won't noticably damage if bent quite a bit. Different bolt length can increase stiffness but may give enough leverage to where if you stomp it the base could break. I need to pick up some hardware to actually test it though.

What about composites tho? You can literally wrap an old boot with plastic wrap and laminate a ~semi-unidirectional strip over it, and then maybe make a dual-bolt adjustment system, kinda like this ![image|690x414](upload://eMqovV7heErZgFzlrtkMchvfTgz.jpeg)  regulates the distance and somethings somethings. I had done couple of working sketches myself, turned out very neat and functioning (toothing my horn here) but did a little jury-rigged full-strap tests with an old buckle belt I screwed down into the board - right straight widow-maker the thing was :S  tho I did only couple of jumplings and what not on a basement floor, maybe I just didn't get the hang for it

Basically this, piece of 8020 1" profile, and the piece slides up/down for adjustment.

With updated (and aluminum) base plate. Also, the printed piece should be updated for better interface, and smaller part overall.

Will see if I can test it today.

What do you think?

So, here is the update:

Yesterday piece was a bad print, today it's slightly updated - smaller part overall, and closer to the final design.
I've mounted one on an aluminum plate for testing, first off two things:
1. there is a readily available endcap, so no need to reinvent it. Also, once adjusted, the 8020 profile can be cut as needed, this is the cheapest part in this whole thingy.
2. you're not going to give me hard time because of the slotted bolts, that's what I had :slight_smile: 

![20190425_124850|666x500](upload://slsEOGAvNxP57ii6BqJVrOFLOrp.jpeg) ![20190425_124907|666x500](upload://me4Q7aOsjP3ND731M3h5juHiBHi.jpeg) ![20190425_125248|666x500](upload://1z5AikcaZEHEw9ZNhhVdUT9gYHS.jpeg) ![20190425_125255|666x500](upload://8R1wv8p0nrAHDYPtzI5HP7tqsYh.jpeg) ![20190425_124842|666x500](upload://jc6ECOHERBrJfmAA4IxXkkpD5ep.jpeg) 

So, I've mounted this upside down, and stood on it through a belt:
![20190425_125354|374x499](upload://v7ucLPgBNJ5Nj5rsn8zN061jEO4.jpeg) ![20190425_125544(1)|375x500](upload://7r8suTuiIuSkJ3kDJqgI0q9Zwyz.jpeg) ![20190425_125544|374x499](upload://zC7vsnbA0nXv8Ssu0DmdrTRlH4K.jpeg) 


Let's do some calcs here:
Let's say we want to jump with a board. MTB board is ~20kg auw? 
So, 10kg per binding, let's double it - 20kg per binding.

I'm 87kg and was completely standing on it before the belt slipped (can remove some material).

This is with PLA and 60% infill.


It's safe to say - you've got yourself a binding design, I believe it's sub 10$ minus the print.

Enjoy,
Dani

I missed this threads progress till I saw @danile updates on Instagram. 

Great job!! 😍 I need this in my life. 

Here’s some input that might have been helpful earlier:

-They gotta be tough. I routinely pick a 30lbs board up by a single binder and do short runs/jumps on foot around traffic/obstacles. Two hands needed for Baja (50lbs+)

-I have countless holes on the top of some of my bindings because it’s a great place to mount lights. 

-the L bracket adds important mounting placement length if you do not want to drill into a board.

Perfect, thanks!
When you take your board by 1 binding, does it flex a little? I mean the black plastic part?

You can interface directly to the 8020 profile, can be a sturdy mount for pretty much anything

Also, 50lb is no issue at all.

FB foot hook = 104g

FB hardware = 15g

Single binding = 307g / 10.83oz

![20190508_113703|666x500](upload://3kDxT6eNu3zR9c8Ve4XZtQInBF8.jpeg) 

 I've only ridden with bindings and I put a lot of force on them. That area is the only one I see being the weak spot. Otherwise this looks solid and I eagerly await its release!

I don’t know, it looks plenty strong enough if you use PETG I doubt you could break it, we will be testing of course!

Danile has a lot of testing, experience and qualifications in this area, there it a bolt at that point, the layers are running the right way but of course he is going to share the design which would allow you to compensate as you like

Have a look at his blog for convincing

This area is kinda free edge, so not stressed other that the bolt.
In addition, this is in compression, even if it fails it's no big deal.

That being said, material can be added at any time. We are 3d printing after all

I did the first pair.
The base plates need little redesign, the holes were too big. So I ran additional pair of smaller 4-40 bolt on the opposite sides.
These aren't structural and hold the profile from rotating on it's axis.

Other than that 1/8" thickness seem ok.
Here are some shots:

Ok guys, have fun!
This is alive on Thingiverse: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3619398

Following are the instructions from thingiverse:

There are two parts to print - left and right binding pieces.

One aluminum plate to machine, I've added a .dxf file for this purpose.
Any aluminum sheet 1/8"-1/4" (3-6mm) will work, simple 2D machining

And one 1"x1" T-slotted profile to get (2-2.5 inches long).

These profiles are widely spread and there's a very good chance you might find enough around you. In case you don't: https://8020.net/1010.html


I designed it to be cost effective with minimum "fancy" parts.
Besides the prints and the base plate, everything else can be sourced for free (in most places) or really cheap.




Here are additional stuff needed to complete the build:

1.    1/4-20 3/4" bolt. Each binding piece requires 4, so 8 bolts total
    Any head shape works (see pictures), my favorite is button head.

2.    1/4-20 sliding T-nuts. Each binding piece requires 4, so 8 in total
    Examples:
    https://8020.net/3204.html
    https://8020.net/3382.html

 3.   End cap. Each piece requires one, so 2 total
    https://8020.net/2015-plain.html

 4.   1/4-20 1/2" FLAT UNDERCUT bolt. One for each piece, 2 total.
    You will have to tap the central hole in the T-slotted profile for this bolt (standard practice) and do the undercut in the aluminum plate (see pictures)

5.    4-40 FLAT UNDERCUT bolt. Each piece needs 2, 4 in total.
    These bolts make the T-profile stay in place and not rotate (see pictures). These don't take any loads.
    The aluminum plates need to be tapped for the bolts with undercut.


The pictures in this thread are self explanatory.

And, as always, if any questions arise, I'm here, just a @ away.

If you feel like I did something right, consider showing your appreciation: [paypal.me/DaniLevin](https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/my/profile)



Also, special promotion, only for the weekend :slight_smile:

Whoever buys my [deck](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/wts-very-unique-deck/92989) will get a complete pair of bindings with it (you can even choose blue/orange color)

Enjoy,
Dani

This is great. How about organizing a "group buy"? One person would collect all the metal parts - base plates, T-Slot pieces, all the hardware and distribute. I guess it can be pretty cheap when purchased in bulks. The parts are lightweight so shipping should be reasonable. 3D printing everyone should be able to arrange for themselves.

I'm guessing ~15-20 EUR cost of parts for two bindings. 10 EUR shipping. Make it 40 EUR shipped total and there's room for making a small profit as well as a donation to @danile, which he surely deserves.

Who would like a set?

@janpom @banjaxxed guys you are awesome!

I'm so glad to be part of this community and I'm happy to deliver a product that receives such love

Thank you!  


For more technical stuff

I'm not planning to start production of these, but I do have access to profiles and aluminum to make several plates on a small scale. There are several in the process of making, because I just have to see @Arzamenable with pink bindings :slight_smile:

So do contact me if you need parts and we'll see if I can help you. 

For even more technical stuff:

In US they have the 10 series, which are 1"x1" t-slot profiles. These are the most wide spread and it makes perfect sense to design with them. https://8020.net/1010.html

What is the leading series in EU?
Is it 10 series like in US, or the metric 20 series, which is 20mmx20mm profiles? https://8020.net/20-2020.html
Or even 25 series?  https://8020.net/25-2525.html

Let me know so I can do the adjustments now,
Dani

I can do that, just need to know your (EU) preference for the profile. Everything else will be derived from this

If I could manufacture a batch of plates. 
Pairing them with short profile pieces and making kind of "short kit" where you'll have to assemble everything together with minimum work involved: several taps, making the phase for undercut, etc.

Will there be interest?

I'd definitely be interested. I'm just not sure if shipping to EU wouldn't cost more than the kit itself. We may need to organize something ourselves here in EU. On the other hand, it's relatively lightweight, so maybe it wouldn't be too bad and if the (stated) price is less than 25 EUR we wouldn't even need to pay any import tax.

Hey guys

I'm getting the quotes for the plates from manufacturers.
For that I'll need some kind of estimates about the demand.

So, let me know if you are interested and in how many?

Also, what do you think is a good price for these? 20-25/pair?

In US flat rate shipping is 7.35$, I can put a lot of plates in one envelope.

Looking forward for the responses,
Dani

I was leaning to something with irony.
Freebords kinda didn't like us to use their product, because they are exclusive or some shit of this sort. Now it uses the 8020 t-slots which is probably the most wide used engineering thingy there is.

Im voting for @banjaxxed given name  **foot hookers** :D 

This word combo sticks in mind quite good.

Though maybe since @danile created them, they should be called Dans foot hookers or DANS? 

I guess a more specific word combo might be useful, if they slowly get to spread further, to distinguish them better

Didn't take all the time I should to read all this thread, but from what I see, I love your work, research and developpement !!!

Awesome :+1: 

Just to give some inspiration maybe,..
   
I have worked a bit on binding before summer 2017 : 
https://monlongboardelectrique.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/img_20170817_131844.jpg
it is supposed to be sandwiched in carbon fiber etc.   
Also, I would use the trampa L to make the support ^^ (v2, I want to invert the direction of the "L" to get the rotation holes position on the deck and the height one on the hooks!!

https://monlongboardelectrique.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/koosh.png
I like the little lips design.. and would want to insert light in it maybe ...

thanks, Alan!  
not at 1st,  
 _sorry, also I miss information I guess (I just scroll over images here  :sweat: thats all :blush:)_  
but, if I understand well, yes ! Of curse, Dani’s pole mechanism could definitely be used with my design! After some rework ^^   
but if he/you like it, I could share it to @danile or try to integrate or combine them. 
(It's an old design, if I rememeber well in 2017 I was trying to move from Sketchup to something else. I think it was made under 123Design .. that was not that easy to use. Now I'm working with Fusion 360. I will try to upload the file ;) )

Nice work!
I was thinking maybe releasing several versions of the top 3d printed piece, with the same interface to the vertical profile.
That way everyone could have their favorite flavour.

How hard would it to have a 3D gear interface between 2 pieces of 2525 profile or even between the watercut base index the profile?

Looking down on the gear it would have 15deg segments and I guess locked down together from a bolt running through the top with a 3D printed knob on top to make it easy to loosen/tighten?

The teeth mesh and the bolt runs through the top of the first bit of profile, both gear pieces, then the base

When bolt loosened you can twist profile that the foot hook clamps to, when tightened the gears mesh and static

Thinking aloud on how to get a rotation given height adjustment is already done

Sounds like adding a mechanism to where it isn't now.
I see how it will make adjusting the piece to your liking angle super easy. But at what cost?
My understanding is you adjust it once (maybe twice) and then ride without touching it. Is this the case?

For this purpose you have the circular slots on the base, like in the original FB thing.

So, I didn't have a board suitable for using these bindings since all my builds we're drop thru style. I was planning on building something, but a member was selling a nice little single drive jet potato board and at only $500 I had to pull the trigger. I plan on eventually using my elofty drives and unity on this board :) 

Haven't had a chance to ride much with these bindings, but they look nice 😁

You guys are amazing. Seeing the speed at which an idea goes from theory to working prototypes these days always boggles my mind.

Maybe ive missed the boat on throwing ideas in the hat, but coming from a mountainbiking background, one possibility has occured to me.

Rather than using the T-slot extrusion for the upright, i imagined a cylindrical post, and a quck release seatpost-clamp type mechanism integrated into the "foot hooker"
This would offer tool free infinite adjustment of both the angle and height, on the fly, without having to loosen any deck hardware.
For most people i suppose the fit and position of the foot hooker would be a one time thing, but for others the flexibility to tweak the fit, or adjust it for another rider, would be beneficial, I'm sure.
