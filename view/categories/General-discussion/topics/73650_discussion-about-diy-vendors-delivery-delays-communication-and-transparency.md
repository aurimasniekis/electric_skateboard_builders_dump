I had a post on reddit about DIY vendors, more specifically just one of them.  Someone had started a discussion about that post in this forum.  I was unaware of this, saw it last minute.  Before I even got a chance to see it on this forum it was deleted, I didn't get a chance to comment.  The point of my original post on reddit was that DIY vendors need more accountability, and need to own up for things like ridiculous delays, false promises, no communication, poorly made boards that require multiple repairs and are in the shop more than being ridden.

It wasn't meant to offend to any one particular vendor, I've dealt with 3 or 4 DIY vendors.  It  was a general statement about how DIY vendors in general should behave.  I didn't post names.  Someone in the discussion here asked if I have proof, yes I have 3 years worth of emails...screen shots, many customers of theirs who have reached out to me and shared their horrible experiences as well.  It even got to the point where certain people were so discouraged by these vendors that they totally left esk8.  Will I post that proof?  No, unless the vendors deny something or want me to post it...then sure, I can.  

Let's not filter any content that has constructive criticism.  I've been in esk8 as a consumer since 2014, and have been following this whole industry very closely (including the DIY scene since the days enertion came out with just motor mounts).  I've been promoting esk8 and good vendors, and in fact I even encourage many other customers to buy boards from various DIY vendors because I was falsely under the assumption that they deliver what they claim.  When I find out things aren't what they seem, it's only fair I mention that too because I don't want more future esk8-ers to have a poor experience and leave the esk8 world.  

I also want to mention that I have had an excellent experience with certain other companies who started as DIY builder on this forum, and so have other customers.  So it's not all bad, a few companies do deliver quality on time and live up to their promises.  I'm just being fair and honest here.  

**EDIT**: original post below if you want to read it...

**What the issue is**

There are about 2-3 esk8 builders I know who are either not great at building boards or have terrible business practices.  These builders are generally all nice people, but in reality the boards they build are just garage projects that may never get delivered. Most of what they sell will have issues, and unfortunately many customers have just paid a lot of money for a paper weight or boards they never received. These are high end builders that sell boards for $2000+. The general public who hasn't bought boards from them will think they are awesome boards, but will not think of what has happened to all the other boards they have sold. The reality is, the boards you buy from them have high chances of having an issue and are potentially not safe, or you won't get the board in the first place. Unless you can do DIY fixes and know enough about building boards, you should not have a board from them. It's not like buying a boosted or a lacroix that get delivered when the promise, and work as expected.  MORE IMPORTANTLY, my main issue is that one of these vendors just lies and this needs to stop.

So I'm at a moral dilemma here, do I tell people to avoid purchasing boards from xxx person and potentially hurt their business? I don't want to effect anyone's livelihood, specially since some of these builders are great people. Or do I just keep quite and continue to let people spend 2000+ to end up with unusable boards or not boards?  So far I have not mentioned names, but anyone who does a search can find this information easily.  Some customers have been vocal, but their posts have gotten deleted or buried.  Others have stayed quiet and just given up on esk8.

**Why haven't we heard more about this?  (More people on this forum need to speak up, some of you know all of this also)**

Simple. People who buy from the are usually older and financially well off people. They usually don't post online much either so you won't hear about it much. And just like me, the people who do business with them don't want to hurt their business either so they won't be posting negative reviews about their boards on reddit. Then there are others who buy a first board from them, and don't even know what to look for in a board and have no basis of comparison. Lastly, they don't sell a lot of volume so let's say if they sold 10 you will have 6 people who don't post anything, 1 or 2 who will mention all the issues and 1 o 2 who will say it's a great board. But it's those 6 that are quiet that really need to speak up.  There are others who just wait and wait for a board and deal with all the BS.

**What do I think?**

There's a fine line between your hobby/passion and a business. Many cross that line and try to turn it into a business. To do that, you really really need to know what you are doing. You have to have the electrical engineering knowledge, software knowledge, skateboarding knowledge (trucks, bearings, wheels), production knowledge, proper QA/testing, and business knowledge. One person cannot have all that, that's why you need teams for a business. You hire others in the aspects you are lacking. A person working out of their garage trying to accomplish all that alone will not work out well. Some of the builders are extremely sensitive to criticism as well.  Rather than being sensitive or deleting criticisms or trying to debate this post, just admit where you lack and improve there.

**Why am I posting this now?**

I realized I could have died, I had a board with failed breaks.  I had another board on order from DIY vendor for a year who kept lying to me non stop.  Multiple people have messaged me telling me their negative experiences and similar stories from some vendors.  Two people told me about their boards just being lemons and falling apart recently.  Other builders never delivered boards even, and I still see posts daily about people still waiting for their boards with no communication from vendors. Some vendors have went radio silent, with customers trying to reach them on so many platforms with no luck.  This should not be happening in any industry, and this only makes the esk8 DIY builders look bad.  Why is no one stepping up to stop this?

**Does everyone have issues with these DIY built boards?**

Of course not, keep in mind that for all the issues one will have there will always be another person with the same board who isn't having issues and is doing fine. There will always be those one or two people who vouch for a company or a builder. But when it comes to safety, there should be more consistency.  There shouldn't be only 1 or 2 happy customers with many unsatisfied ones.  

**Who should I not buy boards from?**

I actually won't be mentioning specific people.  What I will say is, look at all the boards sold from a particular person and see where they have ended up. Don't just take the word of one or two people vouching for a person. Also you want customers to do the praising of the board you plan to buy, not the company/vendor praising their own product. Look for a builder or company who has sold a good amount of boards, and one where the feedback from all the customers is consistently positive. Seems fair and obvious right?

I want answers, but hopefully solutions...not debates.  

Also those who have not purchased boards from these DIY vendors cannot make claims about their boards or service.  I have purchased boards and so have the customers who have messaged me with their negative experiences.

I have a feeling people are a bit exhausetd since last time this came up... 

However, if someone is interested in getting a "pre-built-DIY-type board", I suggest they try to learn as much possible (for example on this forum) about what things make a board reliable and well built. And, if someone has a reputation of building great boards and has done so for quite some time, that probably means something... 

And DIY vendors for me is vendors selling parts for DIY builds or someone who only puts available parts together, not contributing much to the uniqueness of the finished board. 

The builders that have their "established" brands (even if they are doing it small-scale compared to the meepos etc) shouldn't be named DIY vendors.. 

Not many esk8-brands/builders (if any) can offer boards that don't need repairing down the line, and board is in no way more likely not do break because it comes from a bigger brand.. But, you are probably more likely getting great service from the smaller established one-man-brands, as they put a lot of pride into their brand and boards. 

I also believe that you are a lot more vulnerable as a smaller brand as things tend to get personal (especially for the customer, but maybe for the builder as well) if things go wrong or not as expected, whereas with a bigger brand your expectations are different. I believe that one is more likely to accept that the bigger brand has "its way of doing things" good or bad, even if you think it sucks...

Ok, then let's call them builders with "established" brands.  

It doesn't matter if you are small or big, plain lying for a year is unacceptable.  Claiming "your board will delivered next week" for one year week after week is just wrong.  

Selling a board that has to be sent back after riding it one or two charges means there are other issues that need to be worked on.  It doesn't matter how willing the small time company is to fix their boards, if it keeps breaking down after each repair eventually they will give up or the customer will continually have to pay shipping fees and cover fees for parts.  Not to mention they won't have a board to ride.

Of course, I believe this should go for those buying from the bigger brands as well. One shouldn't buy a Meepo and expect it to perform as a ... ehm.. what bigger brand perform well??

I'm not putting all DIY vendors/companies in one bowl, that's why I specifically said 2-3 builders.  I also mentioned I had great experience with one DIY person who is now a company.

Boosted, evolve, etc...they deliver board when promised.  That's already way ahead of certain DIY vendors.  Boosted does not have blatant lies.  Boosted boards work for the most part and a small percentage have issues.  Evolve has crap batteries, everyone knows that before buying.

DIY .... you know for what it stands???
you also know before that not everything is perfect and that you should have some understanding from what you get. It´s not a plug and play.

And just to say, boosted made me to go DIY because of how they handled me as person...
don´t want to say there CS is in general shit, but i´m a bit really pissed that my board broke after 250km and the CS is totally overstrained with it...

Blind pride being hit is the same thing as being sensitive to criticism.  True pride would be to make customers happy with quality builds, and with honesty/transparency about when they can deliver boards and what actually is happening.  And also by not going radio silent on customers.

Funny thing is, some of these builders know about all this.  Customer X took his board from builder A to builder B, builder B said "wow, builder A has no idea how to make a battery pack and these welds are horrible.  Let me re-do this for you."  

What I'll never see is builder B saying that about builder A publicly, even if it's the truth.

that happens also with the big companys.
just saying.

I just had good experiences with local diy vendors, so i can´t tell anything else.
If you support your locals you can´t get wrong in my opinion. Let´s see what time will bring.

You know, DIY and ready product are a big difference.
We build board, we work with them, we learn who shit works, we create new stuff etc.
Not all of it is great and work in first run.
Not everything get ready in time.
But in the end I´m proud of what I created.

You can´t expact that a single man army have years of research on custom build boad...
When every bord is unique it´s possible that some things work better than others. 
If boosted would sell every single board in a different configuration, you think they would work always without issues? they even now don´t do so....

that´s why it´s imortant to understand what you buying.
you should understand the basics.
how to set up a vesc, how to fix small issues, how a good battery pack should look like...
if you can´t than you just not the right person to buy a custom made board.

this is NOT about all vendors.  Firstly I am talking about vendors who sell completes only, not parts.  As I clearly mentioned I have had excellent experiences with certain vendors selling completes.  But a few who are well known here, most of their customers have consistently bad experiences (very few do have good experiences with them).  

Why no names?  Because I don't want to effect anyone's livelihood, rather I want those vendors to improve themselves.  And at least admit they have been not so honest to many customers.  I'm in the US so it's US based vendors.

[quote="dareno, post:16, topic:73650"]

[/quote]

Telling people to do research before they purchase is not scare mongering, at the end of my thread I simply stated that ask most of the previous customers from a specific builder about their experience before purchasing a $2000+ complete from that builder.  That's 100% fair.

Here's the big questions you need to ask yourself Mr Photorph.

1. You appear to share this opinion entirely with yourself. The rest of us understand that being an esk8 vendor is a challenge, accept the inherent problems and move on with our lives.

2. Is it not clear to you that spouting this nonsense on Reddit will do nothing but smother the innovation, development and choice this community bring to esk8. You are damaging the reputation and livelihood of builders who gave you all of the "amazing innovation" that the major vendors are currently incorporating into their Chinese decks.

3. Why do you need internet validation? That's clearly what this is all about. You're here again, opening up a discussion with yourself in a clear and simple attempt to create drama and feed your ego. Calm down small son, we don't really need your input.

End of thread, see you next year when you need more upvotes and bring this all up again.

2. Yes, you have a point here.  I love what these builders are doing and some of them do have innovations that I like.  I don't want to smother innovation.  I just want builders to be honest, that can't be hard to do but it apparently is.  

3. You don't need my input, but there's potential customers who buy boards with an idea in their mind that their board will get delivered on X date and their board will be amazing.  Those customers end up being disappointed and those are the people I'm posting this for.  Not to "feed me ego".  It's not to give input to you.  It's to give insight to future customers to be more vigilant rather than just clicking pre-order.  What kind of validation are you talking about?? I have no idea, I'm not getting paid to do this nor do I enjoy typing all this out.  I'm asking for solutions, not looking for replies or "feeding my ego".  

You know what would be a lot better for these vendors?  If they just start replying to all the ppl who have emailed them that they are ignoring, if they start being honest, if they improve and test their boards before shipping and using customers as beta testers.  If you think asking for all that is feeding my ego... then I don't know how to reply to that.

80%..... that's a pretty bold claim. 
This is an extremely one-sided discussion.
Even if what you're saying is true and 80% were unsatisfied. I'd be willing to put money down that 50% of those customers are idiots. Who either didn't know what they were actually ordering. Or didn't take care of their purchase.
People who just expect it to work because they threw money at it.

I can post my proof if the moderators okay it.  I'm talking about complete boards that were bought.  Very few people buy complete boards form DIY vendors as they are over $2000 per board.  How do I know about it?  Customers have told me their stories, I post on reddit all the time and they have messaged me there.  You can also see some stuff publicly on facebook groups.

Who are the 80% of the customers? You've spoken to 80% of the people who have bought from every single professional esk8 builder in the world over the last 5 years, collated their experiences and communication in a spreadsheet and have that data to hand for us to review? Lets see it then please.

Aside from basing your assumptions on personal experience, which seems to be what is happening unless you can give us this mystical factual data you've accumulated, who made you the esk8 detective hell bent on stopping people from being defrauded by vendors you don't want to name?

I bought an Evolve GTX and it developed 7 separate faults, I paid 2k and didnt ride it for 3 months and I was charged to return it 4 times. Shall you and I set up a personal crusade against all major vendors and warn everyone not to buy from any skate vendor for the rest of time because of my single experience? I'm ready to go, lets fake some statistics and get the ball rolling.

you're right, that number is made up.  But consider this, with the exception of 2 people or so...almost every other customer who I have contacted has not been happy.  So yes that number is talking out of my ass in a way, but that's the rough ratio I got from what I have seen.  Unless these vendors have a lot more boards sold with many happy customers who haven't said a word...that number may not be far off.

Do you even understand how consumerism works in the slightest?

10 people buy a product
1 person has a problem and shouts from the rooftop
1 person returns it and leaves a review saying it wasn't for them
1 person has buyers remorse and creates drama (This is you)

the other 7 just use the product,k eep quiet and get on with their lives.

You're even more simple than previously anticipated, you are basing your "evidence" off the first 3 people in that example. Wowzer.

And all these customers you've talked to who are unhappy. they were all 100% honest on the entirety of the situation with you....
Yes they spent a lot of money on a skateboard.
But some people are idiots.
While I believe there are things a vendor should uphold.
They also shouldn't be financially responsible if someone mistreat something and just expect someone else to deal with it.
Since we're just making up numbers :roll_eyes: I'm going to say 80% of the people you talked to are idiots and aren't telling the whole story.

And every one of them did everything in their own power to fix their own belonging.....
I had a pre-built board break within 2 months the vendor fixed it and it started breaking again so I took the initiative and fixed it and that part hasn't broken since.
I also have a DIY board from a vendor I trust a lot and something he sold me broke the first day.
Because that's what happens.
None of these boards are reliable brick houses.
Things go wrong. They're not going to fix themselves.
Some people would much rather complain then actually try and fix the problem.

I feel like moderators will delete this post.  Fine.  it won't help anything, i'm active in the local esk8 community and online.  It's better that DIY vendors just admit their past mistakes and be honest from now on, that way I can recommend them rather than advising potential customers to stay away.  

I have 3 vendors in mind.  There is one particular vendor who is totally dishonest.  The other 2 are nice people and I respect them, but there are slight issues with their boards or delivery times that they need to fix.  

If you are a vendor and you've been blatantly lying to your customers about your board being ready to ship, you know who you are.  If you're a vendor that hasn't delivered anything and are ignoring customers, you know who you are.  If you're a vendor who has customers sending boards back to you all the time due to issues, you know who you are.  To all of you... go ahead delete this thread, it doesn't effect me in any way.  But for your own sake, do better and people will be much happier with you.  

In person I’d be friends with all of you including the 3 vendors I’m talking about, but I’d still say the same about where improvements can be made.  

Good night all.

I thought you seemed like an ass hat then, but wow... I had no idea! How exciting!

I love how you put all of this on the Vendor, like the customer has no personal responsibility.  Fucking moron customers throwing $1000s at people to build them stuff, but they have no clue how it works, how to maintain it, or what goes into building it.  They need to own that shit.  

This isn't fucking McDonald's, and no the customer sure as shit isn't akways right.

Harsh words, why?  I never said the customer has no responsibility, it's hard to do that when they paid and have no board.  The customer is not always right, but you won't even know if they never got a board.  Or if many customers are having the same issue...then maybe there is an issue?

I'm not an esk8 god at all, I'm just a regular person who likes esk8.  I never claimed to be anything.  I've never built a board, that's why I buy pre-built completes.  But I do try to look out for other esk8ers who are putting their hard earned money into a hobby they want to like.  

Certainly, you can meet me and I'd tell you the same and show you what my experience has been.  I'm confident you would agree with me in person.  As I said, I'm friends with everyone in person and online.  And I always try to make sure no one gets screwed over.

The issue here is that when you generalize 'vendors', when average joes who know little about esk8s come and purchase a board in future, they will avoid some if not ALL vendors. It somewhat tarnished that genre in general even if you didn't point out any names. Hope you understand.

Should I respond here or in the PM you sent me?

Why do I have harsh words?  It is because you are negatively affecting our community with your Shenanigans, and it just doesn't feel like it is "all in good faith"

If you haven't noticed, many of us truly love and care about this community.  It means a lot to us.

And for us, it isn't JUST about hopping on a board someone made for you.  It is about learning new things, trying things others haven't, making friends with people all over the world, you know expanding the mind in our own little niche way.

Do some of us get defensive and even aggressive when someone defames it?  Yeah I do, but I am kind of an asshole.

It is also how you come across.  You do all these board reviews, reddit posts, social media pushes.  Why?  Then slide in some light slander and made up "facts."  It truly does feel like you like to hear your own voice.

Yeah @longhairedboy is a scary and he also has the best warranty in the business and has only been doing this shit a couple years. Amazing.

@psychotiller can be really intimidating and WILL blow you off.... only if you are a dumb ass and annoying AF.  But will also answer stupid ass newbie questions with elegance and grace.  And he makes bad ass shit that I use every day.

@LEVer is taking too damn long on his shit, but it is awesome shit. Do a charge back if you can't handle it.

@chaka did take a long time to get his shop fully set up resulting in delays.  Again, if you can't handle it do a charge back.  He is making fucking art over there.  Sorry it didn't work out.


I mean shit man you are so damn vague, I know it has to be some of these dudes you are talking about, right?  

The thing is this shit doesn't build itself, it takes crazy bastards like these to innovate and even occasionally let us down to get us where we are now.

And guess what, these dudes are fucking Legends that everyone is modeling their stuff after anyway.

Well so you are mentioning names.  Really one 1 of those 3 I have a main issue with because he is dishonest.  The other 2 I have no personal issue with, just other customers who do that messaged me.  @longhairedboy  is a great guy, very funny too. I’m not talking negatively about him as a person at all, but the boards others had issues with.  I’d ride with him anyday.  The Carvon guy I don’t know personally, have spoken to him a few times in email....but I know a lot of ppl who are pissed at him about their evos from his kick starter and him ignoring them.  

Psychotiller I don’t know.

That leaves chaka... and Matt on fb already posted his story about it in the esk8 club group I believe.  So I don’t need to say much cuz that says it all.  Dishonesty is something no one should tolerate in any community.  

I love this community also, I’m not defaming anyone by stating facts.  Nothing I have said is an “opinion”, it’s just events that took place and facts.  

Have you personally bought a board btw?  I know you are an awesome builder.  Have you bought a complete from anyone?

Some prebuilts are great, some are not. Same applies for DIY and DIY vendors who build completes. 

A well known brand for example could have 100 out of a million with issues. As with a DIY build could have a couple issues out of a 100. I just pulled that information out of my ass but you get the point... i hope.

If you intend to be a business. At least try to act like one. @Photorph isn't alone in the way he feels about the vendors. I respect a lot of what they do but I also think some need to get their crap together. Being part of a company run by 10 people, you'll never hear us give excuses as to why our shit isn't ready or ghost on our customers entirely. That would burn our company to the ground given that our customers are government entities. 

 A chargeback should not be the solution, what if I paid with my debit card? The bank isn't going to do anything about it. These businesses should be accountable for their shit.

That is my PERSONAL experience with SOME vendors. Check the polls on the vendors that won't scam you list. It's pretty obvious which ones have issues and which dont.

Since @Sender mentioned names, I guess I can explain more.

I've bought from 3 companies who stemmed from DIY builders, and have spoken to 4.

1) @longhairedboy - back in 2015 or 2016.  I was his FIRST customer, and I raved about him (you can ask him).  He was and is a cool dude, made me crack up all the time.  He's honest and tries his best.  I did have issues with his board, it was shipped back to him multiple times by me and the person who I sold it to.  The guy I sold it to is still riding it.  The reason I include LHB is because I think his boards need to be built better, if no one else is going to say it I am.  His other customers have messaged me about their frustrations, and I kind of feel guilty in a way because I'm the one that recommended LHB to them.  So LHB is the type of guy I would hang out with and be friends with, but I also have to be honest and include the fact that most of his boards end up back at his shop multiple times for repairs.  A few of his customers have sold their lhb boards after a lot of frustration.  One guy messaged me about how he put so much time and effort into it and in the end he gave up esk8 because of lhb.

2) Carvon: I don't even have to say anything here, no personal experience but you will find many many people who haven't gotten their boards.  Jerry has stopped all contact with them, and just not replying to them.  These are people who trusted him with 1000s of dollars of their hard earned money, and in return they get years of waiting with no response.  A chargeback does not always work, in that sense he's basically scamming them.  Seems like he wants to have a negative reputation?

3) @chaka - My old friend Ollin, where the hell do I start.  It would take a 10 page essay to talk about the lies here.  But I'm not he only one.  I have 3 of his other customers who will corroborate the exact same story I have.  In fact the main impetus for this thread was one of this customers contacting me and telling me what has been happening to him.  Then another customer who basically has a paper weight now.   Forget about him as an esk8 builder, he may be a great and an innovative one.  I'm not denying that.  But let's talk about the lies, and just doing whatever he feels like.  He refunds people he doesn't want to sell boards to, or strings people along for months and months.  He has delivered about 3-4 boards, and I believe 2 of them are hardcore fans of his and he helps them out all the time.  He upgrades their board, etc etc.  Everyone else is just waiting and getting lies.  I don't understand the business model.  Don't sell stuff if you only want to give it to certain people, and definitely don't lie.  Seriously Ollin are you trying to burn your company into the ground???


Here is a company doing business the right way:

-Lacroix: extremely professional, deliver their boards, boards are high quality, and they are honest and responsive.  The GOLD standard, why can't all you other vendors just do business the way they do??  How hard is it to not take years to deliver things, to be professional and honest to your customers, and be responsive rather than ignore them?   This is so rare in this DIY gone to selling completes, there should be more than just Lacroix here.  But since it is rare, I would have paid twice the price of my lacroix to get it because there is no competition on professionalism and service.  And this is why as you all are already seeing, lacroix will be the most successful company.  They already have more sales than chaka or carvon and they are the newest.  I wonder why?? hmm.

I've also heard positive things about Kaly, but no personal experience.

At least now you aren't talking about the DIY community as a whole. Thats an improvement I suppose. 

All I did was mention all the Vendors. 

@OllinBoardCompany
@longhairedboy

How you had it before, it could be anyone including @psychotiller and @Kaly.  And if you think that doesn't effect them by burning DIY altogether with your beat around the bush shit, you are mistaken.

You think these dudes are rollin in doe or something?  I know what they charge and I know what it costs to make.  And there isn't much difference there.

Well 3 things:

1) I sold my LHB rather than trying to learn it.  I'm not the one who is wanting to fix things, it's his other customers who did.  They didn't want to learn, they bought a complete board to have it work w/o it breaking down.

2) uh, I never got a board from ollin after waiting a year so I can't learn much about that.  

3) people from carvon pre-orders who are mad...well they are down about 2 grand each with no board and no word from some Jerry guy they keep ranting about, so not much to learn there.

Basically it boils down to if you want things done your way do it yourself. 

I wouldn't want to offer these services to you guys on here because there is a bit of a blur here between corporate business and friendly "one of us" sort of thing.  Also its not just DIY builders that have these issues... look at Enertion themselves, open or empty promises, delays, component issues - and these are guys that have chucked serious money into RnD! These boards are high performance machines and we subject them to a lot of abuse, they are going to break down.

Maintenance is different from welds opening up and a board breaking down every 20 miles.  From an LHB customer.  

Here is a customer of Ollin btw.  

"ended up being a bit of a lemon. Not only did I get the smaller motors but the "arsenal" trucks bent on me and the axles were undersized leading to wheel wobbling which is fucking scary at 30mph. I think the "spline mounting" of the gear is a mistake - lathing a cast truck body not only seems to take material off the axle from slipping, but as soon as the truck bends (which... is the first time you stand on it) you're back to out of alignment. The motor mounts were slippy, I had to take them off, clean them, and apply loc-tite to get them to stay on the milled truck.

I love the large packs and the uni-body construction is really interesting - but one of the packs had no glue or anything holding it down so it would slide/clunk back and forth when you picked it up haha.

Maintenance on the thing was virtually impossible. No connectors anywhere except for the phase wires - everything was soldered together inside. Motor mount had tiny little hex head screws rocked in so tight that they stripped when trying to remove it. Nearly every screw holding the metal plate into the deck was stripped both on the heads of the screw  *and*  in the wooden body of the board itself (you know, tighten it down and it just spins and spins lol)"  

I don't have too many more comments from ollin customers, almost all didn't get their board and were lied to.  You can ask Gary or Matt if they are on here.  I think walgreens loves his ollin, so that's one person that is happy.

I missed this, just read this entire train wreck of a thread, I've got my CF 6374 190kv soap box out and mountin up...

> I didn’t post names.

You should.  WIth the allegations you are making bu not posting names you com off as dishonest and vengeful, like you have an ax to grind.

> I have 3 years worth of emails…screen shots, many customers of theirs who have reached out to me and shared their horrible experiences as well.

Throw them up in dropbox or google drive, give people a chance to respond.  I think you will find the majority of these people are not capable of maintaining a custom machine just like they would be incapable of maintaining a 32 ford coupe. Go buy a fucking Kia.

> It even got to the point where certain people were so discouraged by these vendors that they totally left esk8

The they have no heart, enough said.

> Will I post that proof? No

I wonder why that is?

> When I find out things aren’t what they seem, it’s only fair I mention that

Now this pisses me off.  Who the hell are you?  The esk8 jesus title is taken (@Deckoz),  as near as I can tell not a single person here is asking you to take on the mantle of arbiter of esk8 justice.

> Simple. People who buy from the are usually older and financially well off people. They usually don’t post online much either so you won’t hear about it much. And just like me, the people who do business with them don’t want to hurt their business either so they won’t be posting negative reviews about their boards on reddit. Then there are others who buy a first board from them, and don’t even know what to look for in a board and have no basis of comparison. Lastly, they don’t sell a lot of volume so let’s say if they sold 10 you will have 6 people who don’t post anything, 1 or 2 who will mention all the issues and 1 o 2 who will say it’s a great board. But it’s those 6 that are quiet that really need to speak up.

This is by far the worst example of assumption and logical fuck-tarddedness I have ever seen.  You MUST be a politician to come up with some epic planet size bullshit.

> A person working out of their garage trying to accomplish all that alone will not work out well.

Once again, dumb as shit.  Every single major innovation that has occurred in history has been driven by one person, one dude who wanted some shit he didn't have and couldn't find it in himself to live without it and said screw it and made it.  You need read.

> Some of the builders are extremely sensitive to criticism as well.

Some people are extremely sensitive to lies and bullshit, I'll give you that.

> Multiple people have messaged me telling me their negative experiences and similar stories from some vendors.

I want to see that, or Im calling you out as a lier.  There's so much bullshit you've thrown up in this thread I could plant a frikkin garden.  There ain't no one messaging you looking for help or asking you to advocate for them.  I am just gonna assume you are trying to leverage this false reality you are trying to create into a youtube channel or IG followers or some other goofy job.

> Two people told me about their boards just being lemons and falling apart recently.

You say crap like this and its null content.
1.  you wont prove it
2.  its only a miniscule part of the story
3.  in combination with all the rest of the crap above you prolly made it up

> this only makes the esk8 DIY builders look bad

Are you fucking kidding me right now?  You have personally  caused the set back the cause of esk8 when it comes to new builders and its acceptance as an alternate means of transportation.  You.  This is your fault.  You did it.  Fuckin ass hat.

> when it comes to safety, there should be more consistency

I think the real issue here is that you need to learn about maintenance.  If your gonna run your board through the mud and then into a wall, you are obviously gonna have to fix some stuff.  That's not a manufacturers defect, thats a @Photorph defect.

>  I actually won’t be mentioning specific people.

Yeah, we understand.  Because that would mean your crap storm will be proven totally unlegit, a fallacy and fantasy.

> and one where the feedback from all the customers is consistently positive

Because that has ever happened.  If you sell 3 things, someones gonna break it with a hammer and then cry about it because they think they are special.

> I’m not defaming anyone by stating facts. Nothing I have said is an “opinion”

Bullshit...

> The reason I include LHB is because I think his boards need to be built better

@longhairedboy makes some of the best boards that can be made.  How do I know this you ask?  I've ridden some, as in more than one.  I've purchased products from him, more than once.  I wanna see your statistics that define this "Opinion" you have.  Oh, you don't have any...why doesn't that surprise me.

>  His other customers have messaged me about their frustrations

Lets see the messages.  Is it from the one guy that ran his board into a river?  Or is it the other one that had a chipped wheel and screamed for 2 weeks that he was robbed?  You cant make allegations like this without proof.

> One guy messaged me about how he put so much time and effort into it and in the end he gave up esk8 because of lhb.

Lets see the message.  I bet you 100 bucks he did something stupid...if it even exists which I'm really starting to doubt now.

> My old friend Ollin, where the hell do I start. It would take a 10 page essay to talk about the lies here.

I've not purchased a lot of products from Ollin, but I will say with my limited dealings that company has always been above reproach and more than happy to resolve an issue.  Oh yeah, they make good shit too.

I'm gonna close by saying a couple of things...

1.  Get back on your meds & go see your doctor, your obviously in a downward spiral.  
2.  Unless you provide proof of your allegations I'm going to lobby the other moderators to suspend your account as you've broken at least half a dozen policies in your crap bag of a post.
3.  There's not many people that I have a hot anger in the pit of my stomach for, but your god damned sure on that list now.  When you come into my house and start throwing lies, there are consequences.

DIY boards that are from legit people like @longhairedboy are built with much more care, better materials, and all round are a much better product than any of the "commercial" ones

I never ridden one or saw one irl but from what I have seen on here they seem to me that they are the best option to go to, if your looking something to daily that is not a toy and dont want worry about it breaking down


You can not expect anything not to break down, it will some faster some sooner
If the board has problems from the start return it right away and get a board from a different seller

This is called stereotyping just in case you didn’t know, and this is the reason that even some of our @moderators lost their shit when you posted it on reddit. 

As someone who is still forced to take general ed history classes I can tell you that this kind of thinking is responsible for a lot of tension in society, and has a habit of spiraling out of control. When widespread, it’s also responsible for a lot of war.

While the issues mentioned in your post may be valid to a certain group of DIY builders, admitting that you’ve only bought from 3 or 4 and then writing a post that implies this is something that goes through the entire DIY world only hurts the community.

In my opinion the market has tons of little tune up's whether DIY or market board. One of the first things that attracted me and fascinated me with the sport was the technical aspect of it. I have owned a couple company boards and built a couple of my own DIYs and the reliability on my DIYs has been much better. Honestly one of the main differences to me is that people in DIY don't mind taking out their hand tools to give their board a quick fix. Now take the average boosted rider for example, most of these guys would probably prefer to just send in their board anytime there's an issue and just want it to work perfectly (dream world btw). The reality is company boards are plagued with the same issues as DIY, screws coming loose, battery issues, remote drop out issues, trucks snapping in half, enclosures breaking... all common issues we face whether DIY or bought board. The thing I like about DIY is as soon as there's an issue I can generally diagnose it and fix it myself. A common theme with people who own company boards in my local ride group is that the DIY'ers are at most every ride and company board people are always complaining about how they have to wait 3-5 weeks to get their board back. How does it feel sending something in for someone to repair where they don't even tell you what they repaired and then sometimes give you a high price for the replacement parts? It's no different than apple repairs, the companies will get your board back then explain you need new parts outside your warranty. Though I respect where you're coming from I don't think DIY has been any more a test market than the numerous kickstarters that have plagued the market with poor quality products. E-skate is in it's infancy and I would say we're all trying to figure out what the tricks and keys to this whole sport are still.

Done, lets see it.

I heard a story once about how there's 2 kind of kids.  The first kind of kid wakes up christmas morning to a bucket full of crap and gets mad and angry and cries.  The second kind of kid starts digging in that bucket with zeal and purpose.  When asked why, the kid says "With this much shit there's gotta be a pony in here somewhere".

I'm gonna take a sick day and start looking for the pony.

Problem is you use your Reddit street cred and yell through a Megaphone.  You really do have an impact on our entire community. 

Everyone here stands on eachothers shoulders! We are a god damn community of cool ass mother fuckers.

I have a Lacroix. I LOVE IT.

Do you think Lacroix would exist without Kaly? 

Do you think Kaly would be Kaly without Trampa? (Though I don't like Trampa and am psyched he is moving away from them).

Do you think that Haya deck everyone is so psyched on would exist without Ollin?

Fuck no.  Like @Lunasi said, this is in its infancy and we are all learn from eachother.

Then there is you.  Doing shit all.

I have no "street cred" on any forum, I'm just a regular person like anyone else.  Lacroix, Kaly, etc all great.

All that has nothing to do with dishonesty and is not an excuse for lies from Ollin.  @mmaner is getting some proof in PMs from OTHER customers besides me.  

Since you all think it's just me trying to ruin the DIY scene, that's the last thing I want to do.  I've repeated myself so many times, I want vendors to be honest and straight up.  If this is coming of as wrong or I'm saying it the wrong way, I apologize.  But I've made my intent clear, no lies to customers giving their money to these vendors.  You all are standing up for the vendor, well I'm standing up for the customers who buy from them.

[quote="Photorph, post:58, topic:73650"]
@longhairedboy is a great guy, very funny too. I’m not talking negatively about him as a person at all, but the boards others had issues with.
[/quote]

I'm just going to come out here like i always do and drop truth bombs. 

I've never built the same board twice. Not a single board was like like the one before it, not even now. But all of them are welcome to come back for upgrades and refreshes and yes, routine maintenance. Almost exactly half of my boards have come back for one reason or another. I am soooo not ashamed of that. Here's a bulleted list of reasons why some of my more notorious builds have come back:

* guy tells me his board won't turn off, i say send it back. I had recent;y found an issue with my eswitches and knew what was up. he says he wants to keep riding it. I say no, bad idea, he says its fine.. he floats the fets on his eswitch which heat up and short the BMS killing the board completely after causing a small and very contained fire inside the box which suffocated immediately. This after he's managed to smash the shit out of it which caused the whole thing. Broken phase leads and signs of neglect and abuse everywhere, never mind that he raped my artwork. I replaced his deck, got Jerry to throw in some carvons after a good wait like you do for Jerry, and the motherfucker ended up with an AWD carvon build on a brand new deck. Tell him i said hey, i know you talk to him. Pretty sure he's where you got MY numbers you were throwing around like you knew shit on your own. 

* CoCo Chanel is on its way back for a new remote and some Carvons on the rear that he got second hand. Always down for upgrades, and even cross-grades and retro-grades if you want it. 

* Natural wood stain with circuit patterns came back after they let their friend borrow it who promptly cartwheeled it into a curb and smashed it all to shit, including some of the electronics when the battery slid forward after breaking the silicone and heat shrink seals. New deck, checked battery, needs new FocBoxes, still on the bench waiting for ESCs and a response from the customer. 

* More recent witchblade GT on SR wheels with a black and red hex pattern and white mountain design came back for a new remote. Interference in their area that we've not seen before. We swapped it for free using a remote of their choosing. 

* Tron board wanted all manner of shit that was unsustainable and i did it anyway, and he ultimately ended up with a complete replacement based on a deck that was a motherfucking christmas present to me by the first bullet point. Much to my mother fucking chagrin. But more to the point, the replacement was to replace the replacement. I built that motherfucker three boards and he sold the last one which was made from parts i may never be able to acquire again. Don't let me find him in the street. 

* Sword Board was a fucking Fiasco and I will never do a co-op build with NGV ever again, their parts are crap and just blow up and melt on a moments notice. So much shit went wrong and upside down on that. I'm just glad i have nothing to do with it now because none of that shit inside is mine anymore. I like Stanly though, he's such a character. 

* YOU got the very first one. Of course its going to have problems, its the first mother fucking one sold. but i took care of you. I replaced your shit, fixed your shit, and went upside down on your wants and needs. Why? because i love all of my boards. I could give fuckall about the customers, its the boards i do it for. My blood is in them.  

![00|666x500](upload://5IrbbqKo9VXAc6c7Nkqfrz1LOSm.jpeg) 

Say hi to your board, and that sassy little chica who was shredding the shit out of it in Vegas a few weeks ago. that's my crusher next to it. I'm never going to lose track of that Black Metal Scarlet and i hope it comes back again because i'm the only one who knows how to whisper to it.



Every board i build is better than the last. You got the first and couldn't hang with the growing pains. The first five almost bankrupted me but that's what i get for totally misreading my worth and trying to compete when there was no competition. There is still no real competition. Every commercial board out there is getting people ready for one of mine.

I'm back bitches! I wasn't supposed to come back for at least a year but I need to set the record straight and dispel some of the lies from @Photorph 

> Here is a customer of Ollin btw.
"ended up being a bit of a lemon. Not only did I get the smaller motors but the “arsenal” trucks bent on me and the axles were undersized leading to wheel wobbling which is fucking scary at 30mph. I think the “spline mounting” of the gear is a mistake - lathing a cast truck body not only seems to take material off the axle from slipping, but as soon as the truck bends (which… is the first time you stand on it) you’re back to out of alignment. The motor mounts were slippy, I had to take them off, clean them, and apply loc-tite to get them to stay on the milled truck.

I remember this board it was @FredSaberhagen , he tore the board apart, documented it and sold it off for parts and not once did he ask for any service. We did send him new trucks before he had any issues with breakage. Funny thing is we are giving warranty service to the person he sold some of the parts to.

Photorph also continues to lie and say he waited a year when in fact he was refunded around 6 months after purchasing the board. Still a long time but what we are doing is not easy or even very profitable. The truth is we tried our best to dissuade him from purchasing a board from us from the very beginning and referred him to LHB. After he purchased from us we continually tried to get him to take a refund when the delays in production began but he chose to try and strong arm us through social media. 

Photorph also brought up the case with Matty OH but he failed to reveal that Matt was refunded long ago for his purchase and was going to be notified when we had boards in stock ready to ship. This is a huge omission and speaks volumes of Photorph's intentions here.

It is no secret that you feel scorned, your actions speak loud and clear but you are crossing the line. I have heard from other customers about you telling them to ask for refunds or telling them that I am unstable and bipolar. Pretty harsh accusation to make to someone you say you want to be friends with.

I am far from perfect, it's true I am not the best businessman in the world but I build a damn fine machine and I am proud to be part of this community. You wont break our the bond or friendships that have formed with your fear mongering. All you are doing is excluding yourself from this great community of builders and riders.

I guess you have accomplished one good thing... you brought me out of my forum hiatus!

We @moderators doesn't support any act of post that doesn't support future builds & creativity. You can mumble, complain, etc somewhere else. There are plenty of places to spam these days :smiley:

That is what he made before on Reddit and honestly even if I agree with what you say, in this case it’s good that @Photorph came here by his own (more or less) and started this topic again.
In the end of the day the involved people had an opportunity to tell her part of the story and now as min we here know both sites and everybody can decide by his own who to believe more.

This type of post have lasted quite a while since the beginning of this forum, it was much worst back then when all vendors are less experience with less capital and smaller markets to deal with. I am not saying that it's fault proof, but definitely better. More vendor, more options and better parts more or less.

I am here not as mod, but as a long lasting member of the community. Personally I don't defend anyone or any vendor as human, we do mistakes we are not robot. Per say 3 from 100 happy customers still quite good customer service. You might hit the lucky jackpot, no one knows.

I know that everyone here in the community, experience builder and so newbie deserve the best customer service and after sales. We want quality parts, delivered fast with no troubles. Trust me we all want the same (both vendors and builders). No man wanted to start a bad business (unless they are scammers), thats all.

The problem I've seen by far is that there are points where demands are overwhelming compared to supply. Esk8 is a relatively new market and new business, it's on a very early stage around 2 - 3 years back. Not so many players especially in the DIY market established high volume capacity. Most vendors are still working manual in their garage. With all due respect, without them there is no esk8. When you're on the early bird, when VESC didn't exist yet, you would be thankful that Enertion & Chaka are the very first to bring it in. Although I personally experience bricked a VESC after 5 minutes. That truth hurts, but no way I could justify it. They are DIY vendors working in a garage after all. It's a risky play in a new market. **With all due respect, I also encourage all vendors to provide their highest service to builders as that what kept us here. Reading & looking out for something new.**

@Photorph I have personal tips of purchase for you. **Before simply adding cart into their webshop, you can always say Hi to any vendors here, ask questions and check their response.** That should ruled out few vendors for you already. One way or another, good things comes with great patient. Trust me as a builder my self, I know how it feels to wait for weeks (even worst months) to get our parts delivered to our front door. Yet I think next year, more player and bigger vendor with bigger budget going to flood the market. More options to choose. If you wan to go the safe side, my best bet is to wait and watch. Enter the market when you think it's ready and not when it's not good for you.

**DIY was meant to be cheap, eventually end up as high cost hobby.** You need multiple parts, spare parts, tools, etc. Even if you're excellent electricians / mechanical engineer, this is a challenge on it's own. Thats the fun part of DIY :smiley:

None of these are offered as pre-built unless you count @psychotiller custom builds...but its what I want, so I build it and it awesome and fast and dangerous and I dont give a F$#K! :slight_smile:

Correct. It was brought up by a guy who got all hot headed, then we all dogpiled the guy who posted to reddit but didn't post here. The whole thing was a disaster.

Exactly the opposite of this thread, which is a wild success since the original commenter DID start the post and we retorted in a somewhat mild fashion compared to the drunken post vomit that was the last thread.

Once again, I disagree.  Vendor bashing is not allowed because if users inability to mage the dumbassery that ensues.  I originally argued against that policy, but time and time again it turns into a bitch fest that only bears a passing resemblance to the original posts intent.  I can show you example posts, or you can search them out, but it ALWAYS happens.

I’m sure you met my sensei and brother @Kaly in Vegas, him and @Mikeomania12 taught me a lot about diy so trust me when I say that board is in the better hands of @BOOSTEDO than on mine. Dude would treasure that girl like she’s he main chick his girl has become the side chick. If that board was in my hand, I would have blown it up one way or another with some crazy set up, and YOU of all people should know how much of a demand I put on my boards.

That said though I knew it was a present from @archee so I asked and got his blessing. In hindsight I probably should have asked you too :sweat_smile:

@Photorph is back in contact, and we are discussing the issue.  Maybe we can boil it down to specifics which can be verified and then investigated or show to be false.  Either way, a conclusion to this thing needs to happen so its not open ended.  Answers solve problems.

I’m still here, Jesus.  I have work and I sleep also.  I’ll reply to everything, give me a chance.  

It seems like the vendors want to gang up on me, I’m literally a just a regular consumer.  There is a lot of effort being put to discredit my claims, yet if you look at replies it shows that what I said is true.. but there were just reasons given for why things happen that way, and then it went off topic with everyone trying to find negative things to say about me rather than owning up.

@longhairedboy I said you are a great guy and as you know I vouched for you and informed many people about as a builder that bought boards from you.  But you are digging through my insta and posting pics calling me a Disney character?  Seems relevant to esk8 and the issues I’m trying to discuss, real professional.  I never once said anything negative about you as a person.  I mentioned the fact that your boards end up back with you.  I also had the carvon guy and yes zpoole message me and basically say they had bad experiences with their boards.

@chaka matt, gary, and myself have the same story. None of these people asked for refunds, they wanted honesty.  Not for you to hold their money and then randomly refund them months to a year down the line.  I apologize for calling you temperamental, but you can at least admit that you are and you do pick and chose who you want to get along with.

@carvon is just MIA.  He just has $1000s of dollars of ppls money with no contact with them and no certain delivery date.  Their kick starter was a year ago.

Sure, I have no skin in this game either.  I don’t have a board from any of these people.  

I’m here trying to be ambassador for esk8, it’s the only hobby I have.  And I don’t want stuff like this to happen.

I don’t want things that are happening currently to continue.  I want more of an approach where vendors admit mistakes and improve, rather than gang up on customers and continue doing what they do.  I don’t want people’s money held up with vendors not responding.  This is ridiculous,  no other industry takes free loans for long periods and ignores customers.  No other industry is unwilling to admit faults and improve, and then attacks the customers.  Noting I’m not a customer anymore.... just being a voice for the rest of new comers.

I’ve been as civil and reasonable as possible.  I didn’t even post screens shots and names of other customers and what they said.  Only did that via PMs.  I’ve been nice to all the vendors, only discussing issues relating to esk8s and business practices.  Most people responding here against me have not experienced their money being held by someone for long periods while they were stringed along and lied to or were just plain ignored.  This kind of behavior by vendors only negatively hurts their reputation and the community as a whole.

This is the Walmart mentality that I was alluding to earlier.  Each and every product you buy that is esk8 related is a small batch manufacturing process.  This is not Walmart, this is more akin to old school auto shops where mechanics made parts from other parts or from stock metals, it takes time and it wont be great until the 3rd or 20th revision.

I know I was hard on you, and I'm sort of sorry for that, but I think you brought it on yourself by doing 2 things.  One, you dumped all of the vendors in one box when you actually only have issues with 2, maybe 3 of them.  Second, you tried to do it by collateralizing other people anonymously.  You cant decide to attack an entries communities structure and have zero proof and not be objective.

If that's what you want to do, go for it, but it will not be a rewarding experience.  Mostly because none of US have asked you too.  You have 4 people that have an issue yet you claim the vendors cant do busy well AT ALL.  

That does not work in the real world and you will be called out by trying to push those types of fallacies.

@Photorph I never lost my temper with you at anytime, even now as you continue to make libelous claims about me and my company yet you call me tempermental? You have been actively seeking out and privately messaging my customers making false claims about the reliability of my builds and defamatory statements about my character. All of this because we gave you a refund? 

I honestly think the only reason you are attacking the entire builders industry now is you are envious of how much we all enjoyed each others company at the first ever esk8 convention in Vegas. Why else would you be trying to start hatred where there is none with comment like this one you made to the ArcBoards team.

[/quote]

I was literally just thinking that the other day in the context of the whinging that goes on in this forum (not just this thread). If the rampant “customer is always right” culture continues the way it is, we will soon be limited to buying only what we can get from big box stores because they are the only ones who can actually afford to indulge the obnoxious whims of modern consumers.

I remember working as a salesperson at a reasonably large electronics store. Customers would bring back TVs that “didn’t work” and expect me to just hand over a replacement or cash refund on the spot. I’d politely try to address the issue (usually just a setting or connector). They’d invariably get all hot under the collar about their consumer rights, conveniently forgetting that the store actually has rights too. If nothing else - the right not to be ripped off by a customer (intentionally or unintentionally).

Here’s the crux - any business that hands out refunds or replacements no questions asked isn’t doing it to provide great customer service - quite the opposite. They’re doing that because taking the time to deal with your whiney ass (i.e. provide actual customer service) would actually cost them more in missed sales and bad PR. The equation is much different for a small business selling a high cost, low margin product like electric skateboards.

I’m not surprised some esk8 dealers hand out refunds instead of continuing to deal with unreasonable customers. If I was an esk8 vendor I’d be thoroughly vetting who I did and did not do business with.

So was it a joke the many times you claimed me to be bipolar? Was it a joke when you claimed to have waited a year when you only waited 6 months. How about when you claimed to have never recieved your board and carefully left out the part where you received a refund? Your story simply is not adding up. You are clearly trying to damage my company and livelihood.

I didn't wait 6 months.  I ordered in August 2016, somewhere around April or may 2017 is when I got my refund, that's 9-10 months.  The one year figure is for the other customers, that is what they told me (I can't verify their order dates and refund dates).  

YES I did receive a refund, I've mentioned that in other places before.  I also said in this thread that Matty got a refund also.  That's not the issue, the issue was that why did you drag along these customers for months or up to a year and promise things but then just ended up refunding?

The bipolar part is when you treat specific customers good, and others are lied to.  It's like you have two different personalities.  

I don't want to damage your livelihood, I want you to succeed honestly.  You are damaging that yourself by  your actions in the past.  Why not admit it, and just make things better in the future?  I have nothing against you, I just want you to have better business practices.  I'd even get a board from you in the future if you just delivered what you promise on time, and I'd still have no problem advocating for your products/innovation and recommending you to others if you just admit past issues and fix them.  Why are you stuck on thinking I'm trying to damage you?  I promise I will shut up and never say anything about you if you just treat your customers right...all of them right, not just a few of them.  As I said if you did that I'd buy a board from you and be an advocate as I would for anyone innovating and doing things the right way.

within the field of psychiatry different personalities would rather be called dissociative identity disorder, and what you're mentioning here doesn't resemble that either.

My personal TLDR:

* @Photorph wants to warn potential esk8ers what they are getting themselves into when shopping for DIY e-boards. Makes some exaggerated claims but they have truth in them.
* .builders community takes out pitchforks
* Vendors come in and tell another story
* Things get really personal with people he knows
* Me no like

It should of gone like this:
* @Photorph wants to warn potential esk8ers what they are getting themselves into when shopping for DIY e-boards. With a few examples.
* Some .builder members come in and acknowledge that delivery times, maintanance and spending time on troubleshooting are a real thing. And probably also mention that buying a DIY board will almost certainly mean troubleshooting yourself OR have longer downtimes due to repairs by the vendor. As maintenance is something that can't be avoided.

I think the wording, warning, bitching, crying, whatever you want to call it is way over blown. I've nudged people to Damon, Dave, Bara, Jamie and a bunch of other makers over the years because I know they take care of their customers, but as a disclaimer I also ALWAYS tell them that this is a DIY community of people where we often tinker with things in order to perfect them. They aim for the highest quality and workmanship in order to promote and maintain their brand and have tinkered to the near perfection they sell. The customers gets taken care of because word of mouth in this realm speaks volumes.

Then you had loads of contact with many people all expressing the same doubts and feeling the same way.

Now a few people have contacted you and you're not sure if you can trust the comments they made?

Do you have the figures of how many boards were sold and delivered vs how many ppl never got a board?  For carvon it’s more like no one has gotten a board so that 80% figure is a conservative estimate.

For Ollin do you know how many boards were built vs how many per orders there were??  I’ve seen 4 boards being shipped max, based on his own instagram.  Of those 4 boards 2 users are active online.  Are there more boards that were shipped??  Only Ollin would know.  But even if 3 people contacted me and didn’t get a board and there is me as well, that’s already at least half or more ppl who didn’t get boards vs ppl who did.  

LHB boards, do you know how many he has sold?  I followed every build he has on his insta (as best as I could).  Most people have either sold their boards or don’t have it for one reason or another.  Lhb himself posted about 5 boards and their fate.  So how is it not a fact that most of his boards come back OR were sold off?  Find the percent of people who had an LHB that never came back, didn’t have issues, and are still with the owner.  

That is all I was saying with that 80% estimate...  it’s better than you dismissing my claims without doing any research.  I cannot have the hard numbers, so I have to do my best to estimate for all those vendors.  Do you have better numbers??  Tell me how many carvon evos were delivered vs how many were ordered... tell me how many ollins were pre-ordered vs delivered, tell me how many LHB boards were sold vs how many are still with original owner in original form.  You can’t!  I am not back tracking anything. And yes even 1 person reaching out to me is a lot... but when there’s 3-4 with the same issues that is “loads” to me given the volumes we are dealing with.

Have these vendors commit to
Improving and admit their mistakes, and promise to not lie to customers.  I’ll be the better person and stop and admit defeat.  This thread can be deleted and I won’t ever speak of them again unless they ignore customers and take their money again, or lie to them.  

As I mentioned earlier, I’ll advocate for them again like I did before.  I’ve vouched for all 3 of these vendors before until I found out all this, specially with Ollin and carvon in terms of customer service/lying.

Or you all can keep debating and discrediting me, and keep looking for faults in what I say or keep classifying it as BS.  Which helps nothing.

I average 10 to 12 custom boards per year. (i'm not even going to bother mentioning everything else i do lol) They don't go on insta if i'm too busy or its similar to another one i built or i don't feel like it at the time or i'm just trying to get it finished or a number of other arbitrary factors.  Almost exactly half of them came back for a number of reasons including but not limited to actual warranty work. Most came back for upgrades or part swaps or some other kind of tuning specific to the individual. Most of my customers start upgrading them as soon as they figure out they're able to with different settings or additional affects. 

Now how is it not a fact you ask? Well, you didn't ask me, and you don't know ALL of my customers. therefore...

Also i do ArcBoard's US warranty work. I know how they're built and they're solid.

Also i follow your posts. I especially like the one where you're hugging that dog, its adorable. And the teddy bear with the Raptor 1 is great.

Just my personal experience with @chaka .... last year he released his revolver drive and I preordered it. Later I got a deal on a raptor 2 spot for 1164 usd and I jumped on that , and I told Chaka I would like to cancel my order since I wouldn’t be needing it and esk8 funds were low after buying that spot. Money was back in my paypal after 2 or 3 days. 

In my opinion, when buying a custom board or part, since it’s custom, there is definitely not as much $$ going into r and d compared to a big company with a dedicated engineer/designer(or team of them) so there is a risk and people should know that, but I was still willing to support that then. I don’t think knowingly telling the customers that their board will be shipped next (however many weeks) when it definitely isn’t is ethical (as I’ve been the biggest critic of Jed for saying that their boards are being assembled and packed when they haven’t even designed many parts for it), but by going custom your heart should be prepared for delays and stuff breaking down. That’s where the great after sales service of many vendors on here comes in.

"I’m just going to come out here like i always do and drop truth bombs."  Right.. 
guy tells me his board won’t turn off, i say send it back. I had recent;y found an issue with my eswitches and knew what was up. he says he wants to keep riding it. - not entirely true at that moment we didn't know what the issue was, the next day the board smoked and was shipped back to you


 I say no, bad idea, he says its fine… he floats the fets on his eswitch which heat up and short the BMS killing the board completely after causing a small and very contained fire inside the box which suffocated immediately. 

This after he’s managed to smash the shit out of it which caused the whole thing. Broken phase leads and signs of neglect and abuse everywhere, never mind that he raped my artwork. -  when I ordered the board I asked for specific remote.. not the Steeze you sent in .. I asked for reason.. and yeah the board hit door because I accidentally hit the stupid remote I didn't want in first place.. the resin you put on your wires cracks during shipping..on board you build in 2017 and same goes on board you build in 2018.. in fact.. this time you didn't put grip tape on it and I could just see it but since I put a foam on it.. I didn't care about the esthetics but I do questioned the design




 I replaced his deck, got Jerry to throw in some carvons after a good wait like you do for Jerry, and the motherfucker ended up with an AWD carvon -  I did.. and you should already know to bypass the BMS and you still run it through BMS on discharge and the BMS blew after 8 days of riding.. I messaged you about it.. I asked you if you have spare BMS but you said you don't.. nor you said send it back.. 8 days of riding.. and you even told me that now you run Carvon builds bypassed so why did you run BMS on discharge on my built.. knowing fact we where there.. I don't see the logic

now let's talk about Carvons.. while that is nice gesture to you it was more fixing the problem you created yourself..  On my first board.. we had issue with Torguboards mounts as they slip.. when I told you this is the case.. you told me yeah you know that .. I question why you keep using it.. second.. you told me that Cedric OKP might send you new mounts but it's going to cost 760 extra .. i paid.. and why wouldn't I.. I want my 4200 board be running so 700 extra is nothing right.. on which you write me after I already sent the money the mounts don't fit.. and that you give up and you leave the business blah blah.. then you say Jerry owes you set of Carvons that might salvage the situation..  so after spending 5000 I had board that in continuity run for 1 month... first in October 2017 i sent back to you after 1st week, then second in Mid November 2017 that lasted for 2 weeks  .. sat in your shop till what July August 2018 and then worked 8 days.. because I ride too much.. I'm too heavy? I don't know dude.. I ride all other boards as well I love the madness behind the builds but the execution is poor..  and even then I still try to get you business..  Archee

build on a brand new deck. Tell him i said hey, i know you talk to him. Pretty sure he’s where you got MY numbers you were throwing around like you knew shit on your own.

and the fact that half of the board come back is a sign there is a slightly issue.. you as businessman can't have that.. in that case you need to learn and adjust.. because that's not what keeps you in the business..  which you always wanted..  I know I'm extreme in this environment.. and that's why I shifted to other type of boards and even Unicycle but right of the box there are issues.. and I'm not the only guy that had those issues.. 
broken 3rd printed pulley after first ride, motor magnets after 3rd ride. shipped bad charger, shipped remote without charging cable,  replacement pulley with wrong size.. yeah all those things can be avoided by just checking on the shit.. and it won't probably make much of a difference but put it this way from customer perspective, you see continuity here.. and I would you to see our point of view

I like @longhairedboy and all of this was not mainly about you.  I had to throw you on here because a few of your customers contacted me.  But you are here, being honest...openly admitting that half your boards came.  I have respect for that.  I have nothing negative to say about you, rock on.  Thanks for being a part of the conversation and admitting that there were growing pains and issues.  That’s the only thing I said about you and you admitted it.  Now you are free to take shots at me if you’d like about anything, including me resembling a Disney character.

The other vendors however...they need to do better.  Lying and ignoring customers is not to be taken lightly.

yes..  I agree.. I was not easy and I'm not easy.. as stated I'm extreme..and somewhat I still love the boards (except the deck) since I can't ride it for long but that is something to be considered the risk.. the fundamentals didn't change right?  All I'm asking is people to improve the things that are wrong and perhaps learn from the patterns.. and to your defense yes.. it was 2wd originally and you didn't want 4wd build.. but you did take the money for it and built it..  what I asked you to do is to put parallel plug so I can run separate battery.. not necessarily to increase range but to ease on the BMS .. you said you couldn't... or didn't want to do it.. and here you go.. after 8 days riding.. the BMS blows because it's just too much for it.. for me it's all about purpose...  if I had that plug there.. extra battery with its own BMS is in and boom.. no issues..  and for 4wd setup.. I don't see any other way.. maybe to bypass that but on 5p setup that's a huge stress for batteries if we going to keep the amps open for the motors like that.. and while all this discussions started back then I was still very positive.. in fact I'm still very positive . I really want you guys do well because if you the entire community has benefit from it but you can't be running these business like that and ignoring all the red flags.. and then when people address that get all pissy about it.. like Jeremiah, Jerry, Jason.. if you build board for yourself and ride it.. sure.. but if you go public, take someones hard earned money and then don't deliver for what 2 years to some now... hmmm..  I text Jerry now and then telling him hey this guy is complaining on FB.. not to make Jerry feel bad but to maybe address the situation.. to get the change to correct maybe the broken link.. or be more transparent.. we know it takes time to make it right.. and some might be faster than the others.. but silence is not helping.. remember your situation with Gary.. .. so that's all..

I don't think you guys understand what's going on here. There has already been a change of direction. The Fiasco with your board, zach's board, nate's board, and .. oh wait those are literally all the fiascos... wait, how could i forget swordboard... have all taught me to not do whatever the customer asks and not follow their lead at all whatsoever because they don't understand what they're asking for and can barely be managed. 

We are now building basically identical boards with paint, gearing, and wheels being the only customization options, and only after you ask me nicely. 

There will be no more weird shit to fail. There will be no more "That's what they want, i told them it was a bad idea but they want it anyway."

Direction changed.

well you tried to sell ready sell boards but I find it very difficult.. because we all like different things.. maybe that's why you went back and allow the customization of the look rather than the guts..  maybe you should have 3 different styles.. 3 different bases of boards that you have and just go with only final touches .. color variation,  wheel variation etc.. but in terms of shapes.. yeah I get that you can do so much but me and you talk about numerous times of getting decks from Jamie and that would allow you to outsource that part of that business.. I'm sure with the Carvon builds you have have full hands but even Jamie was not against that idea so you could have in terms of internals same board but design wise 3 different things..

I'd like a board with hot swappable range extending batteries, next to a massive 2S voltage boosting pack (10->12S), a 200A BMS, quad drive, half carvon and half belt drive, custom lipo pack with RGB led turn signals activated by the remote... It needs to ride low, so drop-through, 10S10P flexible pack, 80A battery max per motor, standard kegels... 3 awg wires, bamboo in the deck! Viscious grip tape, paint it all black please. Clear heat shrink on the phase wires, rewind the carvons for higher top end, please... I love keyboards and I was thinking about haveing a built in 20% mechanical keyboard so I can reprogram the vescs on the go... I need to be able to change my battery max per motor to 100A when I connect the extra packs you make me. Can you drop through avenue baseplates?

Zach went out and got a grinder from Walmart and managed to mount classic enertion mounts on Ronins. 

The boy gave up because he couldn't stop destroying batteries. There wasn't a weld in this world that could survive him.

So....................Takeaways: 
1. Do your research and buy products with business practices that satisfy YOUR expectations.

2. Know the definition of innovation and realize you are investing in it, and it just may take more time than YOU had anticipated.

3. Account for hidden stats. Some people are just insatiable. 

4. This site made me buy a Hoyt puck when I have a perfectly working remote!

5. Give Photorph a break, he seems to just have a different kind of passion for this esk8 life. 

I appreciate this online Community, This is where I get the knowledge to avoid depending on someone else to fix my problems. I get there will be some side eyes when someone appears to vaguely bring shade to a positive environment. IMHO, I think the guy inadvertently sympathized with those who just couldnt chalk up a loss.

Uhh, I'd easily give any custom board a 50% chance of breaking down within the first year. The fact that @longhairedboy is willing to speak openly about the repair rates on these speaks volumes for where his intentions lie. I doubt most vendors would want to speak of return or failure rates so openly, because most consumers wouldn't like the reality.

Shit breaks. Enjoying life is about 50% setting your expectations properly. 

As feedback to the vendors/leaders in here- I'm glad that the BS 'customer is always right' mentality isn't given weight over logical discourse. I know nobody involved in this and it's pretty easy to gleen who is just needing attention and who is actually willing to engage in meaningful conversation to put this to rest. 

@Photorph The idea that you've volunteered yourself to be an "ambassador" speaks pretty loudly of transparent attention seeking behavior. Nobody asked you. How "passionate" you come across reads like you're just enjoying the attention. This isn't helpful to you, nor the community.

Carvon we will never see, and ollin said what he had to say even though it didn't resolve anything and my issue was still there.  So there is nothing else left to be said.  @moderators1 go ahead close this thread or hide or do whatever you think is appropriate, so ppl like this don't keep adding things that have already been said .  I said all I had to say, so did all the vendors who will say anything.

@vanarian you arrive with magic sauce just as i finally figure out why and how welds break to the point of accurately predicting and preventing it. I'm on the fifth iteration of this particular stacking pattern and now that i've got it bullet proof... 

yes please let me try whatever you're doing.

Basically unforeseen flex inside the pack. I was failing to see that there could even be flex happening in the places it was happening, so it would cause damage i couldn't really see a reason for. I've known how to build flexible packs this whole time but i was mis-diagnosing the cause of the damage as vibrational stress, which now that i think about it was pretty dumb. The solution is simple, just no longer weld series connections at all ever. The battery in my current board was modified this way and i've been doing everythign conceivable to break it and no matter what i do it stays balanced and charges fully. 

What makes it so challenging is stuffing 60 cells into a package as compact as mine.  Welding series connections saves time and space, but when the pack flexes it will cause ripples that will tear and pop nickel in places that doesn't even make sense some times. 

its just insane to me that the pack flexes at all the way i have it floating. Lesson learned.

@longhairedboy  Have you tried a the superglue method that @PXSS use? I tried in some old cells and they are extremely rigid taking almost all stress from the nickel

Would only work for the parallel groups of course, but could increase the reliability even more

yeah..I'm sure or they complained to their credit card companies and got the money back .but  dude.. come down from the throne and become normal.. why is it so difficult to understand.. well all routed for you guys.. and because we didn't say anything and watched doesn't mean that didn't affect us.. I'm not saying this to harm your or other builders business.. so please don't take that stand.. quite the opposite I'm trying for you guys to see it from our perspective.. and at certain point is no longer a money issue.. .. and seeing that the damaged image is very hard to repair..  this is what? a 5 year old franchise that somehow few of the people thing they are the royalty and rest are peasants.. while Chinese companies slowly infiltrate the forums and markets and will drive you away.. it's been happening for last 2 years.. so if the end client relationship doesn't work, money will be the secondary..  You might not charge 20% fee as Enertion does but that's a policy people accept when they buy their product.. ultimately I know you all want to make it right and to satisfy everyone is impossible but I have seen this very much in kayaking industry as well.. Paddlers loved to paddle.. they didn't really have business mindset.. very difficult to change that because the next person might not be another enthusiast .. it might be someone who just wants to have product for their money.. on promised time.. .. help yourself as well.. cheers Archee

@Nanorider Here's a fact...every kickstarter ever done that was over 20 bucks lasted at least a year.  You complaints about time are irrelevant and unfounded.

@Photorph I've contacted the 4 people you suggested to the best of my ability, not a single one messaged me back.  They either don't care enough to get some resolution or it's  not a big deal.

For everyone else...

This all started calling out all DIY vendors.  Turns out the only people @Photorph had issues with were @longhairedboy, @LEVer & @chaka.    @longhairedboy has answered every question thrown at him and @Photorph seems satisfied.  @I think @chaka has answered everything asked of him, gave quick refunds to those that wanted it.  

@chaka & @OllinBoardCompany has decided to ignore this conversation.  I honestly cannot say I blame them.

Point by point here are my issues with the arguments in this thread...

1.  I've explained over and over that kickstarter campaigns take a long time, its normal and to be expected.
2.  Sure some people made incorrect, even bad, estimates on delivery timelines but I haven't seen any evidence of theft or even dishonesty.
3.  LHB had some welds break, 3 years ago when everyone here was still trying to figure out how to make a good battery.

This entire industry is in its infancy, these are experimental small-batch products, this aint Walmart.  Understand that and you will be a happy customer 99% of the time.  Keep acting like your ordering from Amazon, then your feeling are gonna get hurt and vendors are gonna stop selling to you.

In closing.  I think you (@Photorph) owe the vendors here an apology for the way you handled this.   I really can't even imagine a worse way of trying to let people know that you have some issues with Vendors.  There's a reason why your supposed to look people in the eye when you argue.  By trying to keep everything anonymous you looked dishonest and petty and were incredibly offensive.  When you finally started talking TO people, instead about ghosts, questions got answered.

I still feel like you should be banned for this.  You haven't said anything in this thread or in PM's between us to make me feel any different.  The only think you achieved here is to make our community look a little worse than it did yesterday.  We will recover but I doubt you will ever be welcome here again.

@Photorph wants the ban, he predicted the ban on his initial reddit post and it would do nothing but validate him even more.

Don't ban him, he can pop on every now and then and read about the amazing things the talented builders here are putting together and know that he is excluded. I feel like a ban would achieve more for him than for us at this point Mike.

Not my fault those others didn’t reply.  I am done with this, and that’s probably how they feel as well.  It’s not worth the effort to them, because no one admits their mistAke.


I’m not sure what your definition of dishonesty is,  but to me telling someone you will have your board shipped next week for months and months is dishonest.  

In the end lhb responded, but my problem wasn’t with him mainly (that was the problem for other customers who never got back to you so I guess they don’t care anymore).  Ollin didn’t apologize for lying.  And carvon is still radio silent while they hold the money of so many with no product still for a year...who in their right mind would do business with carvon when they didn’t even reply after all this. (I just saw another thread here of ppl feeling like carvon scammed them, and yet you are here still attacking me saying it’s made up and has no basis).

I’ll be better and say I do apologize to the community for being vague initially because it’s not the community that was at fault, but what I have said in here is true about those specific individuals.

Close the thread, ban me, delete it, or keep it open, or do whatever.  Doesn’t really matter, do whatever you think is right.  As I’ve learned, my input means nothing here anyway.   

No mic drop pic as others have done many times above.  Someone else will keep this going anyway if you don’t close it.

"I have read your comments towards LHB and honestly if you were to purchase from us we would decline service to you based on what you said. I don’t mean to sound harsh but we really don’t want to spend our time with customers who leach the industry dry with their litmus tests on service quality. It hurts the level of service the industry can bring to all customers as a whole. Our service is not for everyone and we do not aim to scale our production up to the level of boosted or any other mainstream brand simple as that. We made some mistakes in the past and we have corrected our course and are once again devoting the main focus of our company to the DIY market."  as I said come done from the throne mate..

@mmaner 
Please close this thread but do not delete it. 
Some valid points all around. 

**My 2Cents:**

This is an infant movement that can’t be call an industry yet and all this type of issues will happen in the development of a new sector. 

Something to have in mind, the auto industry is over 100 years old and **the auto repair sector alone** is a $ 63 BILLIONS a year dollars industry, even on a mature industry things will fail. 

As builders we are in a partnership with the buyers, most of the complete boards are just price $200 to $400 over the cost of the parts, we are trying to innovate but will only happen if is together. 

In short for cool ass boards we all need to carry the weight. 

P.S. 
it is just my opinion.

I think the thread should remain open, it is good to talk about delays or when certain builders ghost their customers. It helps bring things into light and resolve the issues. Sure there has been some name calling here and there or excessive use of the ellipses ... :wink:  but the conversation has been civil and can continue to be constructive. If the thread is closed it will just get buried and the topic will move to a less constructive venue.
