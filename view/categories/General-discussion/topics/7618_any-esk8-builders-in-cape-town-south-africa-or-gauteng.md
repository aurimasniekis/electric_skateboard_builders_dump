Parts are extremely expensive to ship to South Africa,  maybe we can have a group buys or share info on available parts in RSA,,,,

looking for Enertion mono kit, love the blue look with black deck, Deck I can source locally, I need a motor maybe 190kv , batteries, vesc and remote, I think Hobby Mania in Cape Town can supply the motor and batteries   , Mono kit are about R3000 with shippment from Aus, maybe some tax post office bullshit as well

the vesc and mono kit, must be the most expensive to source
