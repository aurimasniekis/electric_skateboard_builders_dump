Right now none, but when I get my bottom mount pack I'll be using the stock mbs ones that are about 1/4" thick.

I took a a piece of 3/4" oak and cut it out on a bandsaw to match my baseplate. From there, i just covered it in epoxy to seal it off from the elements.

Any hardwood will do.

You can cut it anyway you like, just tape some 60 grit sandpaper to a table and clean up the rough edges. It took me less than an hour start to finish
