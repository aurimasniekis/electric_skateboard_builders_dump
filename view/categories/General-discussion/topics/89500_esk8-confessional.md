So- what dumb shit do you guys do? Gimme the dirt.

Things you know you shouldn't do but you're a lazyass and/or need to skate more than you need to fix your problems?

I'll kick it off:

_Bless me Skatan for I have sinned. It has been 2 years since my last confession._

My board has not been turned off for 6 months now.

I burnt out an integrated (eww) antispark on one of my FSESC6.6s and just said: 'eeeh screw it, it's fiiiiine, I'll get to that later" back in October and well, I am incredibly lazy with my own boards and thus have just left both ESCs on since. I'll fix it, eventually. Maybe.

I would almost always rather use coarse thread sheet metal screws than inserts and machine screws.  They don't look as good but I can mount up and ride in minutes instead of being all careful and shit installing inserts.  This makes @Sender cry regularly :slight_smile:.

I store all batteries at 100% charge.  (if they're in a board, that is)

Because if the board isn't ready to ride, it's not doing its job and is useless to me...

Forgive me father, for I have sinned. 

My build has been sitting in a corner for over a month since I'm waiting on a friend to make 2  parts. I've been riding a China board since and it's not nearly as refined.

I put a ton of holes in a nice deck for old enclosures.

I rode my china board home in heavy rain on psychedelics after a rave with duct tape waterproofing. Completely submerged in puddles at some points but it still works. Cuts out sometimes; no idea why so now it sits in the trunk of my car in case fires happen.

I ran a very questionable VESC until I ordered a new one recently, after installing the new one I ended up shorting the old one trying to connect to batteries for testing while the back of the VESC (exposed) was leaning against the motor :man_facepalming:  I guess at least it's completely dead now and I won't use it again (will still try to recover it at some point but right now it's here for "parts")

https://photos.app.goo.gl/9q1yTy4eLkb9huRM9

I really need to shorten all my phase wires by about an inch they're sticking out all gnarly, also need to extend my little series connector it's being yanked to it's end

https://photos.app.goo.gl/X3YVw3kzeqHPbQ2YA 

In the past have used 3d printed boxes for holding lipos on the bottom of my board without the lipos attached to the board itself (hanging) I tried probably 5 variations of that with them all failing at some point before I decided to just go with backpack straps holding them on so far so good but we'll see over the long term how they hold up.

Also used my own home-made remote which was pretty dangerous for about the first year but praise sk8tan I survived the bug fixes :metal:

I screwed up (hah) my deck while trying to install the usual threaded inserts because the holes I drilled were too small. Somehow I managed to get the inserts out without damaging the deck further, in the end I just drilled all the way through and mounted my enclosure with normal skate hardware.
It seems to hold on fine with just the 4 screws.

A long time ago I used a Dremel tool to cut a keyway slot into an SK-3 motorshaft. It took forever, made a mess, I do not recommend... When I installed the motor pulley, it didn't quite fit.I could have dremeled out a little more, but meh. So I, I, I HAMMERED IT INTO PLACE :tired_face:

That pulley remains attached to this day, with zero chance of removal I think!

I don't think it's immature, commute time for a lot of people is long (around 30 min on average in the US) wanting to cut that down and at the same time reduce environmental impact and/or have more fun on your commute which you have to do day in and day out seems reasonable.

Yesterday I was waiting at a pedestrian crossing on one of the busiest roads in my city.

I thought I‚Äôd use the time to chuck some stuff from my pockets into my backpack.

As I put my remote hand through the backpack strap I caught the throttle of my remote and my board shot out across the road in front of a car.

Luckily:
1) the car didn‚Äôt crash, no one was hurt; and
2) the driver reacted pretty quickly and swerved around my board, so no damage

I was so fcking embarrassed though. The driver was pretty pissed off but I apologised profusely and wore the lecture from the kid about being careful üòÇ

I sandwiched two batteries pretty tightly between two boards using wood screws. the last screw I heard a pop, I never did reopen it to check to see if it was the battery. but I've charged it several times since and it's gone pretty far since and I don't see anything leaking or catching fire...
.... also tried screwing a Walmart bike headlight into the front of the board and went in a little bit too far and blew up the battery. looked liked 4th of July in my garage.

When I plan out building or refurbishing a board, I go in with a plan.  A master plan.  A grand plan where I see myself having all the right parts.  A plan where I think I'm going to be super meticulous and detail-oriented.  A plan where I take my time and measure twice, thrice, four times and sweat the smallest intricacies.  A plan where I am super organized and clean in my workspace, where my tools are laid out perfectly.  A plan where I think I'm going to take amazing pictures with bokeh backgrounds, documenting everything.

And then I really build, and it's all fucked up, somehow I drilled a hole at a wrong angle and crooked, my tools are lost in a pile of rubble and e-skate parts and packaging, I have to run to the store to pay too much for a tool I just need to have right then and there because I can't wait and order online, somehow I have loctite all over my carpet and clothes, and I'm bleeding. OH GOD WHY AM I BLEEDING.

And then it's done.  Good God, that wasn't that fun.  And now I have to program my VESCs.  What. The.  Fuck.  I don't get it.  I read and read and read and read and for the life of me I can't figure this shit out.  Max current... errr... lemme search the forum.  Please for the love of God let someone have done the exact same 12s4p setup with same kinds of motors and wheels and gearing and someone who loves the same shade as blue as me have written up their VESC settings...

:(

Oh and I also ride my Boosted board most of the time.

Don't know how bad this is (actually I do), but I've been riding in the wet/rain for the past few months knowing that there is a big ass gap on the back of my enclosure that is everything but waterproof

Last time I opened there was a bit of water near the VESC on the sensor wires, but it's fine, when everything heats up by riding hard it will dry

i once modified a cheap deck by chiseling a cavity for the batteries in, so the enclosure was low profile. i weakened the board so much that i added aluminum spares to the deck and called it good. It was stiff as a brick. I hit one bump and the lack of flex cracked the nose where it meets the inside edge of the front truck. 2 aluminum beams later and a bunch of bolts going through the entire deck, it was fixed. I still have that piece of crap deck buried in my garage somewhere

Because then I'd need to wait 2 hours anytime I wanted to go somewhere.  Why not take all the wheels and tires off your car and drain the oil, then just spend 2 hours working on it whenever you need to leave?  That's why.

If they aren't charged and ready to go, then they might as well be in the dumpster because I can't use them

I operate the same way. I think using the boards you have at the ready regularly makes this insignificant in the long run vs the convenience it serves. 

It's really only an issue if you're letting your packs sit for a long time after a full charge. Almost all of my boards get used daily, so it just doesn't matter.

I use all my boards about ten times a day.  Any time I go to any place, I'm on a board.  That includes work, grocery shopping, going to get dinner, going out to a bar on Friday night, taking the dog out for potty, or just riding around because I want to.

If the battery can't be held at 100% charge, then it's defective in my opinion.  I often wonder about things like an electric car - certainly they charge to 100%, right?  They're also cyclindrical li-ion cells.  So, yeah...

Oh, your fine if you use a full battery atleast once a week, that won't affect its lifespan hardly at all. I dont want to hijack the thread, but thats a good point about the cars.

Nah, they do partial charge day to day, full charge only when needed for trips. Plus they define 100% as a lower voltage. The ones with smaller packs where that's not feasible have much more degradation.

I have 2 Sony Vaio laptops.
One is 10 years old and I have given it to my oldest daughter, the other I am still using is 7 years old.
Both still have their original batteries which show a minimal amount of wear.

The reason?

They come with software that allows you to choose the maximum charging state 50%, 80% or 100%.
I have them both set at 80% and this greatly prolongs battery life.

All the other laptops I have seen have dead batteries between 1 to 5 years.

I wish BMSs would allow us to set the maximum charging voltage to 4.1V

The only prebuilt I've ever owned was a Haloboard I got for $400 because I wanted to play with hub motors. 

The deck got ran over by a car 3 days later and I shed zero tears because it's a terrible deck and should feel bad for existing. However that hub drive is still running over a year later, living life in a board I built out for a friend and probably 2k+ miles on it at this point. 

That's more reliable than any R-SPEC hub motor I've seen.

Yah this is why I've gone with backpack clips to hold my batteries on (also tight space on my deck, and I just don't like the idea of transporting and stressing out my charge circuity) it takes less than a minute for me to clip the batteries off for charging or to throw in my backpack when running around with the board, but I was mostly being facetious I realize most people go a different route.

Also I have backup batteries I can swap out so could in theory charge while I ride (charge them in a "bat box" so relatively safe)

The batteries are in 3d printed shells though admittedly I didn't make a lid for them but I generally just use the train here if it's anything more than a drizzle.

Making a lid from TPU would be a nice addition for some water proofing/resistance.

Oh also the balance leads stay tucked in the shells nothing is exposed outside except XT90 and bullet connectors, everything else is in enclosures (one for VESC, receiver, and bluetooth)

Conformal everything that doesn't require an external connection, also use grease on all plugs, interior and exterior to prevent wicking. Just a suggestion, as I'm considering doing something similar on my emtb, even though I kinda waterproofed the vesc encosures, I know water will find it's way past heat shrink and silicone.

Ok, I made a really crap bracket to mount my vescs, it pulley bites at max lean, but I don't care as it makes me feel like a lean god when it grinds, and it appears to be softer than the pulleys, forgive me sk8tan.. There's also a dirty big gouge on 3 if all 4 mounting holes on the back if each of these enclosures, nobody but me knows they are there, but I see them every time I look at it.. But probably never fix it.. ![IMG_20190407_225518|666x500](upload://qqyE0puSIITYPTsCfgyi0O9X53F.jpeg)

Guess it's not really much off a confession since most people on here seem to suffer from the same problem. But changing your mind about your build at every given opportunity. Making up my mind about what to get was definitely the hardest part so far :joy: 

Second, Buying stuff I'm unsure I'll actually use if the price is tempting.

For the record, Sk8tan does not forgive.....he is a punishing God that will exact his revenge!!! Just in the past few days of posting my confessions he has given me problems with vesc tuning, had me take out my enclosure THREE TIMES only to find out I had a shitty solder job underneath some. It was connecting  and disconnecting given me the false reading. Ob and i drained my battery during my ride to the point it shut off while i was accelerating causing me to eat a big bag of shit!!!!  Lucky for me i was padded up!!! I thought Id be forgiven but sk8tan don‚Äôt forgive,he get even!!!

It must have taken great fortitude for you not to call dibs on his stuff after the funeral. 

So....dibs.

Seriously, though, a very experienced and well-known guy in esk8 died recently in an accident where a helmet would have no doubt changed the outcome. I know I'm not a better rider than he was and chances are you're not either, so food for thought.

Just adding to the list here...

I built an over $2500 board and used it for a total of ~10-15 or so miles before hanging it up to rot... Depending on who you talk to, that's considered a sin! Haven't had time to touch it since :frowning: 

oh and I *guess* I ran about 5 red lights/stop signs because I was too afraid to brake once... Trying to brake at 45mph(downhill) in city streets isn't exactly easy on your 3rd attempt skating!

Hail Skatan, my last time confession was never. 

I have an entire hummie build, deck, hubs, dual escapes, diebms, every freakin part i need. Couple thousand $$worth of parts tools and supplies.  Sitting for months staring accusingly at me, waiting for me to get my shit together and assemble it.  Also 80 brand new 30q cells sitting in a box for months waiting for me to get my shit together and build the spot welder kit I bought and which is sitting in parts in a box nex to the batteries.  

Basically my shit needs a **lot**of getting together.  

Also I actually like riding my shitty Maxfind M2.

-not stopping for harbor police (not real cops... right?)
-using machine oil vs higher quality greases
-not using hand and arm signals
-punching car bumpers who are stuck in middle of intersection
-esk8 ride rage vs cars
-night riding without lights, sometimes on purpose 
-not stopping to answer questions for curious looky lous 
-riding in the rain (hawaii sins)
-riding after happy hour
-not wearing a helmet üôÑ
-antagonizing local security guards
-swerving into bird scooter riders going the wrong way
-using lots (LOTS) of gorilla tape
-way too much epoxy in my attempts at composite laying
-not clipping my nickel strips round 
-I soldered on li-ions (once, old hawaii sins)

I can‚Äôt help but feel that I would want to a rider to chat if I tried to talk to them. 

I found @mccloed randomly out in the wild before I knew of his work with @psychotiller. Luckily he couldnt run too far and I had home town advantage. 

When I did catch up, we chatted a bit, he says, ‚Äúoh yeah, I designed and printed those lights on your board‚Äù.
