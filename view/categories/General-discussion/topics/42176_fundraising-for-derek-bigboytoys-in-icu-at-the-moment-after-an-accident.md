The fund raising is locked and secured until we have more reliable information. I'll proceed accordingly to the community position with true respect to the family.

Thats really shocking news, hard to find words..

For those of you who don't know him as Derek, his username is @BigBoyToys here.

He was one of the heaviest guys here with really crazy strong and fast boards.

Thoughts are with his family!

Derek, I don’t know where to start.  You were one of the most helpful contributors and one of the friendliest people on this forum.  Thank you for teaching us to push the limits in ways we never knew were possible, thanks for your endless contribution to this forum, thank you for everything. My condolences go out to his family and those who knew him personally.  This forum will not be the same without you bro.  RIP.

Friends, it is with a sad heart that I am writing to share this update. We received confirmation that Derek passed away as a result of his injuries.

We will keep these threads closed for now, until have approval of the family to disclose additional detail.

Please keep his family in your thoughts, and rest on each other for support in this difficult time. 

Above all, celebrate the wonderful person that Derek was, and bring with you the best of his good energy into all that you do.

All, 

Thanks to @MoeStooge @psychotiller and @okp we now have a way to contribute to Derek's family in a meaningful way. Please use the link that @okp created and the funds will be given to the family to show our community's support for them.

If Derek ever helped you, shared advice, or shared your passion for riding, please consider sending some support to his family during their difficult time.

FYI the information posted by JESS was completely false and very offensive. I dont even know who she is? My son passed away suddenly and unexpectedly after an eskate accident.We are devastated!  At 9am on December 29th he was doing well and the Drs expected that he would be transferred to Kaiser within a few days and most likely recovered in 8 weeks,per their report that morning. Later,There was a sudden change which was due to a medical error which resulted in his death. We are comforted by the kind and loving remarks on this forum as well as your desire to raise funds in his memory.

Hi @vmaseuli, my condolences, but due to do previous incident with the unknown person, I see you just joined, is there anybody here that can verify who you are?

Every time I think about this, I tear up a little.  Derek was one of those guys that, when you met him you felt like you knew him since you were a kid.  Can we stillcontribute to the fund or is it closed?
