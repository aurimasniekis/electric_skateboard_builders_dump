Who knows what is the distance between the holes for fixing the motor? Can I use SK3 Tutnigy 63mm motor?


What is the inside diameter of this bushing?

You need to ask Frank @trampa bro, if it is not on the web page. He knows all... I have seen plenty of sk3  63XX motors mounted on Trampa's though. I'd be amazed if it didn't fit.

edit:
The [Trampa page](http://www.trampaboards.com/caliber-ii-axle-connectors--carbon-fiber-motormount--p-13681.html) says it will suit 30-44mm motor mount diameter...

Pretty sure that mounting pattern will support all motor mounting options.

And the mount is suitable for any square and circular cross-section longboard trucks?

I've never used it bro so I don't know what it fits...
The page says it suits a Caliber II

I'll send you the dimensions tonight. Still on holidays and kids are jumping around me.
You can mount most motors. 30-44. Should fit most trucks.

This motor mount is for 33 or 37 T wheel pulleys. No way to use it with 66T, also you can't mount a superstar hub on longboard trucks. I think you need a street/urban carver :wink:

No you can't. The axle is to short, truck is not wide enough. Wheel bite will be an issue, even if you manage to mount the wheel to a Caliber II.
