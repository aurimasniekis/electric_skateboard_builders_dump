They new [Evolve F1 Abec 11 107mm](https://evolveskateboardsusa.com/collections/wheels/products/evolve-f1-street-wheels-black-107mm-74a) wheels are out now! They are also priced okey in my opinion compared to other 107mm abec 11 wheels!

As always, I couldn't help it and bought them :sweat_smile:

Hopefully this is a good middle ground for me between 97mm flys and pneumatics. Hopefully I don't just go right back to pneumatics after buying them.

edit: The top speed at 200kv 10s is going to be disgustingly fast. Be safe my 12s friends :p

That is not a bad price.. very fair (knowing the OEM cost). Iâ€™m surprised that they are selling them individually, I thought they were only for their complete boards.

the abec11 reflex formula is this weird stuff, really amazing. The black metro 97mm reflex ride much nicer, imo, than the green non-reflex stuff. This was the case for me before electrifying too, with 76mm gumballs, the pink reflex stuff had better vibration absorption and rollout (keeping momentum) and feel.

At this point my eyes automatically glaze over when I see ABEC11 reflex, and i wake up a few minutes later with email notification of a purchase.

The problem with the Rough Stuff Wheels are two: the dam durometer (85A) is like riding over granite; and they cost like Â£59 Pounds last time I checked... Good, right? ....Naaaaaahhh! There is poison there, delivery ended up costing Â£79 Pounds!! So in all, they end up costing Â£140 Pounds!!  :dizzy_face:

I added them to my list
http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/list-of-abec11-style-esk8-wheels/31063
They come on 5 different colors.

They look like they have the thin spokes (like abecs) but I saw other picture where they look thick-spoked (like the MBS wheels)
Does anyone know if the Evolve-ABEC-pulley fit them?

**Lean Wheels**

Large 108mm wheels from Pramash, the guys that built that famous lean boards. Designed for long distance push. The wheels have a rounded profile and the same 8 millimeter bearings as the regular wheel bearings so you can use them on any other trucks. The label on the wheel is misleading, says 101 mm (which I think is from the outer rim) but they are really 108 mm and 76A duro.

I took a short ride to the store and back(super short, 1/2 mile roughly maybe less). These are buttery smooth. The roll is noticeably better than my 97mm flys(genuine).  

They **are not** smoother than or as smooth as the 7" pneumatics, but that was to be expected. They roll over rocks sticks, and small bumps like they aren't even there. On smooth pavement,it feels magical. 

However, when rolling over sidewalk cracks(like the small gaps between every section of sidewalk) it still make the de dunk de dunk de dunk sound; which isn't bad, but it's just noticeable compared to pneumatics(normal imo). 

I didn't weight them, but they are almost the same weight in my hand as the 175mm 7" evolve pneumatics. They are noticeably heavier than 97mm flys. They also have a noticeably larger contact patch than the 97mm flys(12mm wider according to specs, and it shows). 

I'll report more on range after my 25 mile roundtrip commute to work tomorrow. 

tldr: They're great, and are noticeably better than 97mm flys.

This is odd. Evolved not thinking straight with the color scheme they chose for the cores on this one. Dull yellow wheel cores... while their bushings are orange as well as their old 83 mm cores, WTF? Or is it that ABEC bite this one with their wierd tutti frutti way of chosing colors? :rolling_eyes:

Not only they sell motor guards, but nose guards, all sorts of drive gears & wheel pulley kits, also the incredible honeycomb cut grit tape in various colors (the same Kaly type everybody was crazy about not so long ago); they also distribute this particular ABEC 97 mm violet Flywheels with black cores branded exclusively for Board Bumpers and they also distribute the amazing Onan X2 booster drive system among other products.

What you call a "web page" is actually a web app.  A web page is a collection of static HTML & CSS files that don't change.  In a web app, there is an application running on the server generating the pages when they are requested in real-time -- instead of just serving them off of a disk, prebuilt.

It does seem to be working now.

I tested them offroad today. This build is 10s 6354 230kw dual.
I have to say that I am impressed and also dissapointed. 
There's a difference between doable and comfortable.
I rode on everything. Crappy pavement, stone pavement, wood,dirt, grass, mud, pebbles and deluxe super smooth and polished concrete.
I wanted Less kw but the motors were not in stock.
For my taste they are too fast and too little torque. They are capable to ride on anything at all and  that's impressive but they are way behind pneumatics. I recommend them but always as a second option.

What wheel pulley do you use? 36T is already "tight" on 97mm wheels alone...on 107mm I'd go at least 40T on the wheel pulley and 14T on the motor. You lose quite a bit of torque (but gain top speed) on bigger wheels with the same ratio.

I know...these beasts have enough of everything to enjoy while riding. 40T on the wheel side would improve the torque a bit. And like you've already noticed, some lower kV motors too. 10S is more than enough imho.

I agree on everything you said. 40t would be much better and I would  be more comfortable with 190kw. I don't need that much speed but I had johnny's pulleys at home and I didn't want to wait for motors in stock. 
Since the build is more than I need I regret Nothing. It's a very good board.
The wheels are not as nice as pneumatics but are really impressive anyway.

I am simply loving these new 107mm wheels, abec11 has really hit one out of the park with these. Round edges shed rocks and the reflex urethane is so comfortable and grippy. The size does add a lot of weight, and they could even be narrower, but the width does inspire confidence and have me looking at higher wattage motors to really take advantage of them.Of course I'm doing long range rides and these are almost necessary. Those large off-road tires have puncture issues in my area with goat head thorns, and I really want to keep my setup in the "skateboard" class and not an AT board so these 107's allow me to be as mobile as AT wheels and cross railroad tracks and any cracks with ease. As for how the rolling weight effects efficiency? I don't know yet, but larger heavier wheels will feel more sluggish on anything and will want more power to go along with them. Great job Abec11, keep up the good work.

WHAAT?  The width is what I like the most.  I can sail right over even rough railroad crossings with no fear.  Because of the width, if I hit the tracks at an angle, the wheels never fall into the slot

```
Narrower wheels are more efficient but at the expense of grip, I am attempting super long range rides on a single charge so the narrower profile would be better for me and I believe they have an abundance of grip already.

The battery is 6 balance board batteries, for a total of 27,000mah at 36v, the range of this skateboard is 52 miles and I ride it 50 miles.

The toes stop is from Riptide Sports, who make some awesome bushings, they are sponsoring my attempts at 100 miles and sent me a few toe stops to try out. That is the "Outside" model and I really like it. It allows me to feel where my foot is without looking down and locks me in. The Outside model helps when you ride switch, and the Inside model looks great for downhill, I put the other one on my parking garage racing setup. I have liked it so far, I was worried about tripping on them but it's not a problem and I think I will keep using it.

It's got to be the bearing/bearing seat tolerance.

Assuming you have spacers in between... they may be oversized slightly. But I don't think that's it..

Not easily, but definitely not as tight as it was before or on other wheels, I've tried different wheel spacers no difference. Everything as is, was working fine up until like a week ago when I started to hear a ratcheting noise, slowly eliminated all variables other than the wheels. 
I've been riding these wheels almost daily since getting them a month or so ago, on my commute to and from work there's a bridge I go over, at the top it has expansion joints with what looks likes train tracking sticking up a good inch over the road surface, 2 or 3 of those 8ish feet apart. Every commute I hit those tracks at about 20ish mph. That's the only thing I can think of that could damage the wheels. That being said I've done the same route on MBS for months longer without issue.

However I've been runing my dual 6374s with Abec 11 107mm and no sound comes out of it at all. 

I'd suggest to remove the wheel pulley only adjust 3 centered bolts with Loctite on the tips, do not tight them too much and them mouth the remaining bolts with Loctite too. When you mount them in pairs there is a never ending adjustment that could develop this sound overtime.

If you use grease between the hub and bearing it would rotate inside the hub even more, I tried to use PTFE tape between the bearings and hub and it has helped some but the sound isn't completely gone.

[/quote]

107s for speed, and grip.

Gummies, while the extra 22mm of wheel diameter helps roll over cracks, they have less dampened feeling then 107s. And 15mm less contact patch.

Gummies go on a sub 20mph carve board that you want to roll over everything. 107s on the 40mph speed board that needs better dampening and grip.

Since we are talking 107mm flywheels/superflys, how do you personally go about breaking them in? The grip on my new unbroken-in 107 superflys is way worse than my old classic 81a 90mm flywheels. After 30 miles or so of carving, they are still butter slick... Not feeling it.

I was thinking about throwing some slides at them, but don't want to chunk the reflex Thane. I might just suck it up and keep carving them lightly for as long as I can until they are properly broken in... But for now, mine are super unpredictable and not that grippy while my 90mm classics, while hard and rough, would grip very well and drift super predictably in comparison.
