Purchased a dual motor fvt esc. Programming options with fvt software was total garbage, so I returned it to China. Had to open a case with PayPal to get my $189 back. Shady Chinese seller! Purchased trivent on Amazon![Screenshot_20181014-101210|281x500](upload://oBIatWI288fbCw4K8xvHE9ns6Jn.png)  
Burned out after 2 weeks. ![IMG_20180928_120628748_HDR|375x500](upload://g6BUmr14BQpCgsWiexJkw13Au3g.jpeg)  
Purchased two flipsky 4.12 on Amazon, and one lasted a week, and the other lasted one ride. I'm getting really tired of dealing with shady sellers and crappy speed controllers. I've been building ebikes for years with great luck on controllers. You buy a good ebike controller, it works without issues. Any advice? I'm about ready to go for one of these cheap eBay controllers found in all the Chinese skateboards. They must work better for them to use them in all the clone boards right?

Same for esk8 for the most part. But you're buying the cheap ones. 
The ebay ones are plug and play but not really programmable.

I've never had a problem with a brushless motor. Hall sensors can burn out pretty easily, so I tend to go sensorless when possible. Hub motors for skateboards seem to burn out quickly from what I've heard, but like I said, I've never had a problem with a brushless dc motor. What ESC do you use?

Been running one of the turnigy 6374 for a few years... the bearings are probably at their end of life but what motors have been so bad to you?

To OP as others said you need to buy from reputable esk8 sellers,  has the older ones is a bit hit or miss but better than amazon ones (I've had a few from diy but only failed from my own errors).  Otherwise can go to enertionboards.com or get one from @longhairedboy or @psychotiller or think @scepterr all stock them I'm pretty sure.

Yep I know what motors are out there but. 

SK3 is like 84mm long, no sensor or keyshaft
@scepterr have shaft problems
And the rest are maytech
TB  - USA only really - add 20% for tax on their motors and like $50 to ship...
APS - Just bad

mm gotcha I didn't see grinding down the shaft with a dremel as a big negative really and haven't had any pulley slipping issues so I guess I don't see the big advantage with the key, regarding length I never really checked but only doing single drive so not been an issue for me, but I understand that's not great.

[/quote]

I’m not one to toot my own horn much, but I havnt had a single issue with my 6374’s and over 100 sold. I upgraded some key aspects of the motor and added a a shaft with flat spot and a keyway. They are also sensored.

Yeah I know about your motors and the factory that makes them..

But still its very long and I am pretty sure the screws that hold the can are not great. (not really an issue)

But yeah out of all the motors SK3 based motors or Maytech are great. 

Anyway a bit off topic now

@Kug3lis i like to see your complaints

The picture was of the trivent. The flipsky looks a lot better, as far as soldering and components, but lights stopped turning on and no current output. No visible burnt out parts on the flipskys. They just won't turn on

I mean he bought their motors.

Changed original shaft

He also mentioned he doesn't believe they covered the motor when cutting the shafts.
Which is just kind of asking for trouble cutting metal next to a bunch of magnets....

A new topic on Motors would be great. The above topic is on electronic speed controllers. I started this thread to get advice on speed controllers.it would be nice to know what speed controllers you all are using. What speed controllers have you used without any problems over an extended period of time? Any tips on how to increase the longevity of a speed controller would also be greatly appreciated. I have a dual 6374 motor setup with a 10s battery, anti spark switch, and chain drive. Everything works properly except the speed controllers. Without price being a concern, I need a reliable proven speed controller or 2 for my setup. Thanks

Well lets say the ESC advertises FOC and 12s

Just do BLDC and 10s and your already off to a good start.

FOCBOX
Flipsky 6.6
ESCape
VESC 6
Ollin board ESC

Theres plenty of good:

ESCS
Decks
Trucks
Wheels

[/quote]

Understand that all my advice in general is not of my own but of all the collective information I’ve read on this forum. But from what I can see 

1) operating the speed controller *within* its advertised limits not at 

2) Heat sink the fucker , the cooler it runs the longer in should last in general lifetime wise 

3) Ensuring that all the solder points are solid and nothing , like the capicitors, are Susceptible yo vibrations

4) ensuring your connectors are secure so there’s no possibility of anything being shorted god knows how 

5) heat sink the fucker

The search function is your friend. 
Buy from esk8 sellers
Stay off Ebay/Amazon 
This info has been covered more then a few times. 
And this is coming from a esk8 noob.
I haven't even finished my first build.
There's TONS of info on here about just about every esc/vesc option available.

true but these threads are good once in a while. Like a “state of the community” type of thread with the subjects being Esc’s. Now if someone searches for a similar thread without the next 2-6 months , they’ll either find this thread or can be directed here.

So it looks like focbox is the way to go. Should I run in BLDC mode to add to reliability and longevity? Increase in sound doesn't bother me at all, since I run chains.

Focbox in bldc, 10s, 40a bat max, 60a Motor max and as long as you don’t disconnect the CAN while switched on or piss on them you shouldn’t get any issues 👌

Just out of curiosity, which vesc settings and voltage you was running on the both which broke after just some days?

> Is there any reliable VESCs on the market?

@jayx probably is thinking "no" at the moment. he keeps blowing shit up, but then again, he keeps doing things like running 13S and towing people on home-made carts. I was one of those people this morning. Sometimes its fun to just hang on and scream.

If you buy all the cheap stuff, you will keep re-buying it, and it will keep breaking.  Just get a Meepo or come back when you have a $1k budget.  Otherwise, you will end up spending more in the end.

Even the expensive VESC's will blow up in 5 mins with wrong settings / incorrect procedures. They are far from plug and play. 

But if setup right will outlast all your other components. 

I agree with the above advice though running FOC will kill most all 4.12 vescs / especially the low end ones.
