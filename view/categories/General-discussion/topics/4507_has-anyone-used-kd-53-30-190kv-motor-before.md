Just wondering if anyone used the "KD 53-30 High Voltage Brushless Outrunner 190KV" from Hobbyking before?
http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/__51866__KD_53_30_High_Voltage_Brushless_Outrunner_190KV.html

It seems like not many people are buying this motor.

wow that is a good price for a 10S 2000W 190kv  brushless outrunner. I wonder what thier life expectancy is under skate conditions. 

@DeathCookies How long have you had yours?

Shit... i did not read carefully enough...
I have this [motor](http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/__51869__KD_53_20_Brushless_Outrunner_195KV.html)
Rated to 6S....
I dont have this motor that long... a few month and just 2-3 test drives. But i can tell that it has enough torque ;)

@GrahamZhu nice find; these could be great in a 10s dual config! I dig the gold\orange color of the can!

Bought two of this motor two days ago. After reading the replies, I feel safe. Lol.
I guess it will be sold out soon.
