I was googling for a 12s battery and found this:

https://m.dhgate.com/product/diy-12s4p-43-2v-12ah-518-4wh-electric-skateboard/424274730.html?f=bm%7CGMC%7Cpla%7C1670756630%7C64004387279%7C424274730%7Cpla-296557785071%7C103006019%7CUS%7Cecodream%7Cm%7C2%7C#pd-103

Anyone know if this is legit?

Worthless, a kilo of shrinkwrap is 80 cents and thats around 30 meters, nickel is 40eur per kilo thats if i remember about 70 meters, wires are dirt cheap from china especially if you buy them bulk

anyways materials in china in "bulk" would be less than 10$ for sure
