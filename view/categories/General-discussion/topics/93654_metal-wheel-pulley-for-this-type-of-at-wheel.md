I'm not sure of the name of these AT Wheels I have, but I'm looking for metal pulleys for them ? Can anyone help since I can't search for something I don't know the name of !! Thanks in advance.

If you don't know of any metal pulleys, but use these wheels, what type of pulley do you use that you've found reliable ?

I'd have never found this listing, as even copying and pasting the advert title into ebay UK and selecting 'Worldwide' doesn't throw it up. Shipping is over a month, so I'm still open to suggestions for quicker obtainability in the UK.... otherwise I'll order these :grinning:

Just speak to @dickyho directly and you can decide what shipping you prefer. Make sure these pulleys fit your wheels
