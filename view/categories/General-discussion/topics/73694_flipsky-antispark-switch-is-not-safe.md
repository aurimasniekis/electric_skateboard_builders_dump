So, I'm replacing the switch on my antispark from flipsky, it turned itself off and I lost control of my board and as a result was hit off my board by a car... I'm okay, was wearing my helmet and knee pads so road rash is minimal, however my 1300$ Lenovo Think pad is having to be sent to the service center due to not powering on anymore and I cracked my helmet from hitting a curb, and my backpack is now trash. Great way to start my school day. Be safe out there guys.

The switch they send is too soft and it's defeated by the vibrations in the road

Can you show us how it was installed? Is this the smart switch or the basic one?

It's installed top side and the whole ride the board was turning itself off, I thought I was stepping on it so I got off and sent it over a bump and it turned off

I'll post it when I get home, I'm in school rn, and will be until arpund 7pm my time (it's almost noon)

I'm not sure because I didn't buy it, it was given to me for free as well as some other parts from a local eboard seller

You believe the button was depressing when you went over bumps?

No, I know the button turns off when it rides over bumps... 

This is the off position

This is the on position...

there is a light, when I hit a bump the light turns off and the button returns to the raised position

ahhh so it's a physical problem, maybe it's a batch issue? I remember Raptor 1 came with these types of latching buttons back in the day, had that same issue, which is why they use toggle/rocker? swtiches now

Thanks for the update on these. I had a fear of using this type of button switch for this exact reason. 

I've used these [rocker switches](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07CMY5WZ1/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o04_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) in the past and they've been working well.

My brother got hit by a car once, he says it sucks. Glad you're ok. Meditate and you'll be fine in what, like 15 minutes?

I have the same latching switch on my antispark switch from @eLDoska and havent had a single problem over 500 miles so must be a batch issue

Just wire it up so off is on and on is off, easy way to turn the board on is by dropping it hahaha.

I fucking keep saying we need **soft-latch switch** to end this random power cut madness ! 

@Nordle has been on it too (need to get back on my thread and my fucking schematics then get it troubleshot and done by a competent engineer).  

It's incredible **nobody** so far has proposed a standalone soft-latch switch for DIYers. And yet we get 80km/h capable fucking boards

This is a latch switch I believe... it's just too soft and vibrations are able to overcome it

if u look it physically locks into the on position and then when it's off it's raised up

Yep yours is a mechanical latch-locking switch ; a soft-latch is like your smartphone button, it is always up and as a press = ON / hold few seconds = OFF function. Vibrations couldn't undo this type of switch cause it is not mechanical anymore.

I was thinking about getting one of these. Which one you have? V2.1 smart switch or V2.0 pro switch? I will likely to swap to a rocker switch tho.

This happened to me today... riding on the bumpy sidewalk... board just lost power. Thought I had broke something and noticed that the switch turned itself off. Currently fixing by taping that shit down when riding until I can swap it for something else.

They have a latching switch and it is too weak. If you own or are thinking of buying one please rewire so that the latching position is reversed with pressed in as off and out and on.

what a good idea.  I had this problem with rockers though too.  Anything that is subject to vibration can momentarily become undone.  
Get this I have a nasty switch I pulled off of a cheap chinese esc and wired to my bms.  It is great.  Soft latch.  I have ridden that thing over all kinds of horrible surfaces, the kind that make your teeth chatter and still it works. The only thing worth salvaging from that pos. Even the sun shines on a dogs arse occasionally.  
Really though there is only the loop key that is bullet proof.  Sooner or later that thing will fail and put me in the neighbours yard.....again.

I had the same issue the spring is super weak. just swap the on position to out. it works. Also me anti spark failed and got stuck on. Key loops way better. Less to go wrong

I swapped the switch come with it to a rocker switch, works fine so far. 

But loop key is definitely the better way to do it.
