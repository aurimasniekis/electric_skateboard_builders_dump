Hello All,
As the title says, I am wondering if anyone had been able to source a 10mm replacement shaft for the torqueboards motor. I know that APS motors come with them but not sure if the C clip ring/ other features would fit on the torqueboards motor. 
Thanks,
Thomas

Fits TB stator lol if I didn't destroy the bearings on my failed TB motor I would show you, but it's a snug fit
