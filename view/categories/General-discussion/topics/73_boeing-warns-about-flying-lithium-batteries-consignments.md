Boeing Co. has warned airlines that flying bulk shipments of lithium batteries in the bellies of its passenger jets poses unacceptable fire hazards, likely setting the stage for significantly tougher international packaging standards for all such cargo.

On Friday, the Chicago-based plane maker for the first time issued a formal, across-the-board message explicitly urging passenger carriers world-wide to stop accepting large quantities of the ubiquitous power sources as cargo until more-protective packaging and enhanced shipping procedures are in place.

This news also affects some customers waiting on their enertion battery orders. However the enertion battery factory logistics manager assures me they will be able to continue shipping SPACE Cell batteries soon, however they have new rules to conform to which has halted shipments for a week or so whilst they make changes.
