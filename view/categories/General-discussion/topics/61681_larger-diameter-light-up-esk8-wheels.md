I just saw leiftechs video of their new light up wheels and they look so cool.

I wonder why no one makes them in 83mm+ for us esk8ters I think this would look really cool and make us much more visible to cars and people at night. What do you guys think?

Firstly, you want the car to see and swerve away from YOU. I’d rather the driver doesn’t swerve away from the board and accidentally hit me as a result.

Secondly these wheels are made out of a cheap urethane. It doesn’t matter for LEIF because grip and wear characteristics don’t matter for their wheels.

I'd ask @LunarKim about light up stuff.  He knows quite a bit about it.
