Hi. We have a local guy (Australia) trying to sell a newly developed board. Just looks like every other Aliexpress board out there. Any thoughts?

I couldnt find the same board on alibaba, but I am pretty sure it is a rebrand...The hubs are same as the Actons, similar decks are all over alibaba....

He asks about 900$ for one board, from china you can buy it for 500$ including shipping and taxes...

That generic remote kills me every time. Those hubs are off the same manufacturing line no doubt.
