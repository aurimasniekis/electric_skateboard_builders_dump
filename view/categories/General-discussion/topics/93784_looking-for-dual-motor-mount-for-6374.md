Since almost every truck is a different design, we need to know what trucks you are using right?

I can personally recommend mounts by  @marcmt88
After having 2 mounts fail (DIYE and some random ebay one), this one just feels much firmer, is easier to align, and dual idlers are fantastic for belt grip

I‚Äôve got a set of BKB motor mounts. Made for caliber/Tb 218‚Äôs. Never used. Black anodized, sexy as all heck. I would sell them to you for cheaper than new.
