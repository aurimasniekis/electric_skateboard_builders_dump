Guys / Gals to keep the photos only thread clean while still fostering discussions I thought we can have a separate discussion thread. Link you photos to here if you want to discuss them.

Photos go here.

@suntorytime Yeah, here looks like that a lot but it's horse droppings.  We have horse-drawn carriages and cars and electric skateboards coexisting like a 19th & 20th & 21st century mashup

Sometimes on my  commute there is huge buffalo shits everywhere to dodge. They are like 10 inch diameter. Whats worse is after the cars run them over then its spread everywhere and its hard not to run over some of it. :nauseated_face:
