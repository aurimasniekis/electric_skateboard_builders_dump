I've always read through posts saying you should always use appropriate sized wheels on your longboard but I never did because I thought it wasn't worth the extra money,  I was racing my mate next to the beach and I hit a a gutter or pipe of something , I went from 15mph to 0 in a split second, 

whats your worse accident ? [video](https://youtu.be/d7o5D_K-GB4)

My worst accident was my first ride on my first build. I hit 30 mph, and blew out the esc. This caused the board to jerk, which threw me off. I tried to run it off, but it's just not possible at 30 mph, So after maybe 5 steps, I tucked and rolled. But again, I was going too fast to tuck and roll, so while tucking and rolling, I was sliding on my arms and back.

All in all, I tore off a lot of skin and was in a lot of pain for weeks, as I was wearing just a t-shirt. Now I ride with hoodies almost always and gloves. I've fallen once or twice a lower speeds since then and I can get right back up without a scratch.

I've had a couple close calls. 
Once going 33mph I hit some rough pavement that cause a lot of vibration which caused me to go into a wobble. I managed to ride it out but it took me off coarse do I was headed straight for a center line reflector. I thought that I would eat it but my front left wheel just hopped over it and started me wobbling again. I rode it out and was able to slow down b4 hitting the curb. I came away just a little shaken.

I was skating on my electric and came to a complete stop. Stepped full off my board, then slipped and fell. Luckily I was wearing all my protective gear. Otherwise it would have been a nasty fall. It often hits you when you least expected.

my advise !


WEAR PROTECTIVE GEAR ! YOU ONLY HAVE ONE OF EACH BONES GIVEN . 

so protect them .
...and also have LOTS OF CALCIUM .


1) FULL FACE HELMETS ~ that protects your jaw from dislocation , broken jaw , chipped tooth and so on .
2) ARM BRACE ~ from broken wrist like mine . imagine eating and doing things with only ONE hand with only FIVE fingers .
3) SHIN & KNEE GUARDS ~ the ones on above your feet .  


*just after stitches were cut off . 2 months after surgery .

*with stitches . after surgery . ONE metal TITANIUM PLATE & THREE horizontal 15mm long screws + FOUR vertical 15mm long screws

*too itchy . disobeyed doctors orders ~ "not to opened by myself" . not yet operated . just RE~ALLIGNED the bones BACK INTO ORIGINAL POSITION . doctors says they cannot operate on me as of yet . had to wait another ONE week they said .

*ambulance and a crew of SIX came to my rescue . TWO of them was under study . meaning they just started attending to their FIRST emergency call .

*just came back from work . fell at lift lobby . called ambulance . and waited for at least 10 minutes (maybe 20) . so i snapped with my left hand . basically theres TWO BONES in yr arm . mine was ; one is dislocated while the other one is broken .

I broke a my wrist a month back. There was a bridge and when I got to the top there was a small gap that I didn't pay attention to. So I accelerated, but as I did this my front wheels hit a small curb between the bridge and path. At that point I was on my way flying onto the concrete . I landed on my wrist becouse I did not let go of the remote. Guys if you fall just let go of the remote it's worth it. I got a cast later that day. The next day I was back on the skateboard with a cast lol.

I've had about 4 average falls at about 30 km/h for reasons unknown but suspected nunchuck fails. Thankfully I'm pretty good at running off of falls and slowing myself down to have only ended up with mild hand and knee grazes. 

Here's one:

I went down a little over a week ago. I was speeding on a bike way when I hit a bump and a crack and got jostled and it didn't throw me off but it sent me off course and straight for the guard rail. I couldn't turn away cuz I was barely hanging on and I couldn't brake in time cuz I was going too fast ( abt 28mph when I hit the crack) and I didn't even want to hit the guard rail so I just sat down kicking the board out in front of me. The asphalt went through my back pockets and ground my wallet and a skate tool that was in my other pocket. (That skate tool really saved my but). My board shot across the lane, hit a curb, flew upside down across the other land and landed in the bushes. I just got two little scraps on my hand and forearm. I jammed my left wrist though and it's still sore. 
Now I wear wrist guards, elbow and knee pads when I'm going fast.
The Crack in the road:

Since we're sharing! First time trying to break 30mph on my board. Loose trucks, went over a bunch of twigs just laying on the floor and got speed wobbles... Rolled when I hit the ground, Nothing broke but road rash on arms and legs for days!

So, one thing that i've noticed is that crouching down low seems less stable  than standing with knees just a little bent.
Just seems that the lower you go the easier it is to fall over. Except when taking sharp turns at high speed.
Ever tried to go fast sitting on your board or riding it on your knees? Thats really scary.
I've tried it but I couldn't go very fast. It felt like I was gonna tip over any second.

Fractured my arm. Had it in a sling for a week because it wouldn't move. Aswell as scraping up a large portion of my body.  
The fracture was self diagnosed as I didn't think it was a "big deal" at the time lol now my shoulder clicks when I move it.  30mph downhill brakes were too strong and they threw my off I ate cement big time

I never thought this would happen to me.... I can handle my board pretty well. Long story short, was riding and there was a huge crack in the road. Normally I avoid those, but two things happened. A car pulled out and my attention went to that, I was also in the middle of dodging a a wide pot hole. I didn't quite make it because the car diverted my attention. The board hit the crack and I was off the board trying to run it out.  After two or three gazelle like leaps, The momentum caught up to me and I fell.  Tucking and rolling was not an option, didn't have any gear except a helmet on.  I hit the front of my helmet on the concrete and slid.  I just lost a whole bunch of skin on my hands because it was one of the few times I wasn't wearing gloves. Here is a video just to see some of the damage to my hands. The blunt force impact to my wrist hurts pretty bad. And I'm missing a chunk on my thumb, but I'm glad my head was perfectly fine. Here is a short video showing right hand damage.

http://youtu.be/qdRd5d532wE

Been about 1 1/2 months, still healing.   I'd say in another month or so I should have my skin on the palms back to normal.

LOL wow the last clip I actually used in my very first YT video at the very last second...so funny...the other clips, not so much :( 5:08 was scary as fuck. I want to share this video everywhere because a lot of guys in this video weren't wearing helmets and could've gotten cracked it open easily.

They all need brakes.  

Those are some rough clips. Can't help but watch. 

Today riding my board with the battery unplugged , battery unplugged, vesc slammed on the brakes.  Luckily I was going 5 mph.  I've had it happened before it's the receiver wire falling in and out of connection.  Same thing as before.  I thought I was crazy before but nope it happens.  When the board is powered it will do whatever it wants every couple minutes.  Super unsafe.

this is more in case of braking/power loss
The Brakeboard as an emergency brake is a good idea, but i dont want to spend that much money on a thing that i maybe never use.
Also i heard that the handling of these trucks is not that good.

I've got what might be a broken heal from losing brakes with power loss but I think it's really my own fault and if the electronics are well protected (potted!) it shouldn't happen. Even when both my low voltsge cut off happen using the vesc I still have full power on the brakes

had a few discussions on a facebook page . a rider told us that he was lucky that knew the techniques of sliding to stop and other ways of stopping .
one day he said , his evolve make a funny sound , by the time he could figure it out , he heard a "tearing & ripping" sound and can felt it on his feets . now he lost all controls on his board . thats when he applied his knowledge of sliding stop . good thing he didnt use the 200mm rubber pneumatic tyres .
as for me , i too have torn a belt before , good thing i was just picking up speed . only abt 4km speed .

Only been riding esk8 for about 5 months and had two falls of note.
1st - completely user error. While riding about 5 mph standing straight legged and looking at my buddy behind me, I jerked in surprise when a car unexpectedly came around a near by corner...my jerk caused me to accidentally full throttle...the dual raptor launched me like a catapult assaulting a wall. Made good use of the helmet, but no injuries. My buddy laughed his ass off. Wish I had a recording of it. 
2nd - electronics failure about two weeks ago. Shorted Vesc and possibly motor. Accelerating from stop light hit 15mph or so, sudden brake lock up, shitty superman imitation, then I'm sliding across one of the busiest street in Los Angeles (PCH) on my shoulder and elbow. Really lucky, cars going my direction had enough room to avoid me. Decent, but not terrible road rash on elbow and hands. Seriously shaken confidence is the biggest outcome. Fixed my board yesterday, but I have yet to break 20mph. Bought gloves, in the market for knee and elbow pads.

Also check you truck setup....

Too tight? Too loose? Front? Back? Both? Depends on how and where you ride ...

This can really effect your ride confidence...

It happens...if it ain't right it ain't right ...

If the trucks set up feels good but a little tight...that's ok...
With time and practice...the bushings will loosen up....

As you progress your speed and carving will increase...and will help break in the truck bushings

Raptor. motor attached to slave vesc suddenly went full brake and board shut down. It appears to be the results of a short in the vesc AND phase wires shorting just past the heat shrink as they enter the motor. I believe this happened to @Xusia as well. Both first batch boards.

Yes, this is a problem and while this seems to have been fixed in later batches of motors it should really be checked VERY thoroughly. I can't believe how horrible my motor was, almost no insulation and wires could move absolutely freely at the entrance. CHECK YOUR MOTORS FOLKS!

Happened to me too. http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/r-spec-shorted-phase-wire-problem-solution/6474

Thankfully I never ride extremely fast and have only one motor and the break power of this was not enough to throw me off. The first time it happened it sure tested my brains reaction time.

my first build with an off the shelf hobby ESC and an Arduino with wii nunchuck. I was still working on the arduino FW and had a bug that would apply full brake sometimes if it lost connectivity. I had just grabbed some fresh Chipotle too. RIP delicious burrito.:burrito::bomb:

My left motor cogs/locks up momentarily on acceleration. It just states doing this. I‚Äôll be moving 3-5 mph and then it stutters. Feels like it‚Äôs braking, but just stuttering. Any idea why? Bad motor?  I was riding it with a loose motor mount and lots of vibration.

Man you guys are insane... 

Anyway, I went over a speed bump this morning at 30 km/h and this happened:

![20180202_134638|281x500](upload://bATuKrdOQe8dxJ5hF3ytmkq8h0a.jpg)

I obviously fell of my board, majority of the hit was on my back, but I was wearing leather, so only a scratch. My right elbow is roughed up too... The thing is I hit my head... And it all happened so quickly, it's been hours and I'm still a little freaked out.

Dudes... fucking board broke... I really was not expecting that at all.

Anyway, reading your posts made me feel better. Stay safe yall.

some of the worst accidents and injuries i've had were from 2 or 3 minute slow rides to "just over there" during which something incredibly ameture would happen, such as getting thrown by an ant carrying a grain of sand or suddenly my wheel gets stuck in an imaginary hole in the pavement, or i'm just too retarded to balance that slow.

I fell last week going slow on a sidewalk... A small rock stopped my board dead and I kept going. If I was going faster I would have gone over the rock like it's all good.

I went with a 36" flexy deck and these trucks that turn so easy ![trucks-gullwing-sidewinder-ii-10-polegadas-cruise-carving-D_NQ_NP_15194-MLB20098061463_052014-O|500x311](upload://mbM5Wa9BM6yn1AUphDjtGJvI39c.jpg)

I was getting wobbles from like 35 km/h and when i reached something like 60 km/h I tried to stop.
Everything was fine buy my elbows lost there skill with elbow pads on
