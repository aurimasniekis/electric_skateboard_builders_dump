It's their any guarantee on time (or idea of the timeline)? I might just go with focboxes for my Barret Junction build, as i would save me $700 lol.

Well the shit show continues for enertion...

@barajabali I was just told by your customer service team that they would be shipping best case mid to late January... Why would something in stock not be shipped for over a month?

I ordered hours after you posted they are in stock and ready to be shipped.

I want to love enertion, I really really want to. I love your engineering team. Brilliant guys! I just want a good enertion experience. If I had known they could be a delay, I wouldn't have bought so many and just spent it all on offical vesc 6's, which In the past, I had delivered in under 3 days from the day I ordered.

Thank you for reaching out @barajabali. At least enertions customer service is good now!

The reason being I knew these were coming from china and they are still working this week (I think most everyone is, haha).

But all is good. We have worked it out. Thank you @barajabali and @CarlCollins for the quick response and resolution!
