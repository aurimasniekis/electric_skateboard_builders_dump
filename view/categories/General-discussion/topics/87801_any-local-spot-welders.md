If you don't find anyone, consider purchasing a spot welder.

If you are like me, putting it off (maybe?), thinking about borrowing one locally (seems so...) but wanting to build a battery... think about what you would pay to have someone weld your battery for you. If I were best friends with someone, i'd do it for free, otherwise i'd expect them to at least pay for materials and a little bit on top to make it worth my time. That money that you might end up paying to make it worth someone's time or use on their machine could go towards (close to fully) you having freedom to do what you want with _your own_ equipment.

It's a lot like a soldering iron. I put that off for a while and life got 10x easier when I did get one- maybe you can relate.

A boss level spot welder can be had for $80 + shipping. A minispotA can be had for $60 + shipping. If you have amazon prime, you can pick up a sunnko for around $150 with free shipping. I picked up the $60 minispotA + $15 shipping, and a $40 lipo off  amazon and it does the job for me. If you already have lipo batteries, then it would be the cost of materials + welder if you don't go the amazon route.

If you do end up just trying to go local, I wish you luck... i'm sure there is someone, might just have to do some digging?
