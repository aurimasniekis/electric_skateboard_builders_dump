@claudiofiore88  
Yeeeeahhhhhhh, glad I joined this forum, thanks for adding me.

I'm a college student studying in Champaign, IL this summer. But I do frequent Chicago as I am from Arlington Heights. Would love to do a group meet-up on LSD. That'd be so sick!

Yo Im in Chicago. In live in buffalo grove. Did this happen yet or are we still planning? Also my friend is getting into electronic skateboards but he doesn't have a board. Anyone willing to loan him one for this ride. Otherwise I will probably build a second one for him.

I'd be in too. 

LSD bike path is a bit of a nightmare on the weekends though unless you're north of Montrose. 

What I'd really like to do is ride very early in the morning around the downtown Loop on a Sunday when it's completely empty or on a holiday when everyone is out of the city (like Labor Day).

I live in Hinsdale and work downtown near Willis tower. Also if anyone is looking for homemade LiPos, check out http://www.chiboards.com/shop/. They have a good selection, but they're a bit expensive. I'm free all day Fridays and Sundays for a meetup, possibly Grant Park or nearby

Thanks for looping me into the thread Greco, and yah I'm in Oak Park so a 20min train ride from downtown so would be good to know when people are meeting up.  Unfortunately, weather has started to go south so looking at balaclavas and other ways to cover any exposed skin, but anyhow always down for cruising around if I have free time and a charged board.

Haven't finished my board yet, but when I do I will be riding with you guys. Also, can any of you Chicago locals possibly meet up and help me program my vesc? I've watched all the youtube videos, but it's still confusing. Not the best with that type of stuff.
