Hey guys!

I first got on this forum over 2 years ago and built a board back then. It has been working pretty well since then, but I think it is time for an upgrade. I am looking to go to a lion battery pack and possibly add on another motor. I want it to look a lot cleaner and easier to charge

Here are my current specs:
* 6364 245 kv hobbyking motor
* 6s 25c 5000 mah zippy lipo
* torqueboards vesc
* torqueboards motor mount
* 36t abec kit
* caliber trucks
* knock off amazon flywheels
* tupperware container
* imax b6 charger

What do y'all suggest I do, as I am sort of out of the loop in all things esk8


Current board:

yeah probably. the only downside of it is that its all metal and doesnâ€™t absorb much impact

But even if you do deck swap you want a short kicktail deck right?

Maybe grab a pair of 6355 motors so you can stick with your caliber trucks.  The 6364 wont fit dual unless you get wider hangers and most people stay under 200kv. But that will make the stance wider so keep that in mind. 

Then you only need one tb mount/ vesc /pulley and a battery.

I might have a riptide deck I'd let go for dirt cheap.  Its similar enough, and wood. Lol

But you can also get oldschool kicktail decks for like $32 shipped from Skateshread.com

Was gonna say since hes got a small enclosure space a 10s2p with 40t would be nice.

Was thinking just that a 10s2p of 40t (not 30t). A 40t 10s2p pack would be very simular in capacity to a 30q 10s3p at 8000mah

If you want to get the shit scared out of you, I would go for this setup (same as I have) Battery: https://www.eboardsperu.com/product/10s4p-battery-pack-for-loaded-vanguard/ ESC: https://www.enertionboards.com/focbox-speed-controller/focbox-unity-dual-motor-foc-controller-esc/ Motors: https:///collections/electric-skateboard-motors/products/electric-skateboard-motor-6355-190kv

I think you might have to swap to a bigger deck though ahah

I could build a pack with any cells you choose but in your case i would recommend Samsung 40t cells.

hey yall trying to get back into this and finish up the rebuild (since my lipo battery is on the verge of exploding). Im trying to keep the budget pretty low on upgrades. Do you think a 10s lion pack would be too much? Also any recommendations on a pack?
