Hi, I bought the flipsky-like VESC https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07GFB55NV/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 and am trying to  find the motor connector. Is the cable connector OK? https://www.ebay.com/itm/3-5mm-Male-Female-Bullet-Brushless-18awg-Motor-Ext-Lead-200mm-Suits-15-amp-ESC/131648388314?_trkparms=aid%3D111001%26algo%3DREC.SEED%26ao%3D1%26asc%3D20160908105057%26meid%3D74155346be7b424a88bb76b6eeaf7e8e%26pid%3D100675%26rk%3D1%26rkt%3D15%26sd%3D131648388314%26itm%3D131648388314%26pmt%3D0%26noa%3D1%26pg%3D2481888&_trksid=p2481888.c100675.m4236&_trkparms=pageci%3A23ee49c4-d8c0-11e9-b5b2-74dbd18021ba%7Cparentrq%3A3bc085aa16d0a4ea9b3c5f37ff9eb8d3%7Ciid%3A1. I noticed that it said 15AMP, but I am going to setup  motor current MAX as 80A. 

Not sure if motor current and the current passing this cable is the same.

I would not do 80A max on the 4.12s. they throw over-current faults even lower than 60. 

and you would buy female bullet connectors for whatever size comes on your motors.
