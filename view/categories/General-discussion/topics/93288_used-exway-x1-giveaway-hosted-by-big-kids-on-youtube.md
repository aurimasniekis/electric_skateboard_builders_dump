Itâ€™s the fact that your new to the forum and flooding it with random threads we donâ€™t need. Sure Iâ€™d like a free exway but the point being is stop making unneeded threads.

@thebeardedboy

The general consensus is you seem to be missing is that you keep opening new posts at a 1 post per question/thought rate.

I appreciate that you've started asking your questions in the noob thread.

Remember this is a builder's forum, not reddit. There isn't much need for topics for free giveaways. If there was one topic about giveaways and you posted this one under that topic, fine. 

TL;DR

Don't start a new post for no reason.

I had the excuse to buy a meepo because of Sonny and now I would not part with it because when all is said and done it does exactly what it says on the box and keeps on doing it.  Unless you spill beer on it. When you get bored you chuck the whole thing on another deck and carry on.  I would rather ride anything than nothing.  Any cheap ones near you?

Tbh, I actually really enjoy my teemo board. It has a decent range and it gets me where I need to. Nothing sucks more then not having a board to ride. I had to get my hands on a temporary board till I start building my next one

I'll give you a like for that.  I'm a bit slack in the like department lately.  Consider yourself blessed my son.  

To be honest I can't say I like the meepo because it slows down when going up hills and thats a cardinal sin but it always works and its all I have to ride till Dexter pulls his finger out and gets me a new charger.  @torqueboards   I'm riding a meepo mate.  Its humiliating.  What have I ever done to you?  Hey?

Hills is the only major problem I face here and there but I donâ€™t have too many hills to worry about. Canâ€™t wait to start my emb build so I can get off the teemo and pass it to the lil bro.

Please don't delight in my misfortune.  I have a bench full of fire breathing monsters and I'm hamstringed due to laziness.  Fix that?  Na.  Got the Evo.  Fix that?  Na. Got the Evo.  Fix that? Evo is fucked.   Got the meepo.
