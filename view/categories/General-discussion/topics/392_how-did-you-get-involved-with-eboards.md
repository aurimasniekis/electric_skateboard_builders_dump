I found out about eboards when I saw my friend's brother building a rc hovercraft that didn't turn out that well... Anyway, from there I had a look online for some fun electric projects and I came across an eboard video. So I searched up hoe to make one and came across endless-sphere and then came to this forum as well a bit later on.

lol, seems kinda creepy/unrelated 

maybe change it to how you got involved with building eboards? that would be a little more on topic, as this is somewhat random...

**like for example:**

 I built my first eboard for a science fair project, because it was the only way my parents (I was 14) would let me spend my $$ on something so "stupid and useless"

I bought the wrong stuff multiple times, absolutely destroying my original budget goals by close to $250USD, and basically got the "I told you so" from my parents.... finally I built it, and here I am 2 years later still spending money on the "useless" idea!

On a side note, I wish I knew about ES and eSk8 when I first started, but for some reason I only found out about it less than 6 months ago...

haha random questions today indeed!

unfortunately eboards somehow steal all my money, so gaming has to take the backseat most of the time...

My bro and I went in together on an xbox one and a 2 games (madden, and call of duty), but that's about it... I never really play it either. on the other side, Gaming PC's are just too much $$ to build, and I'd rather be outside anyways. 

I enjoy relaxed competition with some friends, but I wouldn't really consider myself a gamer :video_game:

Same situation with me. I'm supposed to be getting presents for mum,dad,brother for christmas but e-board has taken all my money.

I got a PS4 and cod but we can't play with xbox one people...

Do you know much about gaming pc's?

One day i found my 1991 Ray Underhill ( Powell Peralta ) deck in my closet. I've been holding onto that thing since i picked it out of a catalog for my mom to buy in late 1990. I wanted to do something with it but i wasn't sure what exactly. Maybe i'll put some indies and 60's on it and try to learn some tricks again. Or maybe some 70's and make a nice pusher out of it. 

The following Monday i was at work telling a friend about it, and he suggested i strap rockets to it. I was inclined to do so and even doodled out a nozzle system that would allow me to use model rocket engines mounted under the board but directed out under the tail.

All in jest of course. 

Except people have really done that and there are plenty of youtube videos of actual rocket sticks, or so i found when I began googling my ridiculous idea. It was during that googling that i found some electric skateboard videos, which ultimately led me to Enertion, DIYElectricskateboard, and Alien. I ordered my first kit from Enertion in September of 2014 and I've been hooked ever since.  

Since then I've bought three decks, multiple ESCs, tons of odds and ends, and i've even started down the road of making my own decks and building completes for people. 

I still have the Powell deck in my closet and it still doesn't have anything mounted on it.

I think i saw an ad for evolved. I  then began researching and found none of the eboard companys made a board that could do what i wanted. I have been into longboard dancing for a while now and had all the stuff i needed to build boards already so why not build my own. With the internet .... you can build/fix most anything even if you have never done it before. I remember the days that we had to buy manuals or books lol. Enertian,diyelectricskateboards, endless sphere, ect, had tons of info and people willing to help. Internet = win. 

Pc gaming since the 90s. Original cs was bad ass. I suggest building your own rig if you want to get into it. I prefer a logitech mouse and mechanical keyboard. You cant get all console games on pc but some of them come to pc years later. I have over 200 games on my steam account! So your average gamer haha.

Ha! You're going to have to plan something special for that board, given the role it has played.

I wanted to travel to work faster and traveling uphill at 20mph and passing by everyone + saving 5 to 6 hours commuting.. Godsend!

Catch the early train, Leave for work later, No need to take a bus ($2.25/one way).

Pass all my co-workers up the big hill.

It's awesome....

First found the Zboard, then found the Boosted.

Luckily, both weren't selling at the time and/or weren't in stock. I wasn't going to wait 6 to 8 months so decided on building my own.

Hi TorqueBoards, I was just wondering if you got my reply about soldering beforehand? UBEC is the only thing I need soldered before if you can do it. Otherwise don't worry about it.

I originally got one of those fake hoverboards and it didn't seem very useful for commuting anywhere so I found out about eboards and decided to make one. I found about endless-sphere forum and then this one.

In regards to Pc Gaming, as controversial as this statement may be, I have to say that PC gaming is superior in every way to console gaming with the exception of one thing. The only way it is inferior is because it often does not get polished products, even from triple A companies. However, thats actually more of an issue with Companies rather than the platform itself. From a capabilities perspective, a PC can do everything a console can do and more, for probably cheaper as well. Even if you really want that sofa experience you can always hook a PC up to a tv and hook up a usb gamepad. If you want it to be easy to carry around so you can bring it places, you can always get a mini tower.

I have wanted a motorised skateboard ever since i first watched the B.R.A.T patrol when I was a kid.
but it wasnt until recently i saw what evolve was doing and I wanted to keep my snowboarding skills active over the off season that i decided i would start making my own. I had already built 3 electric bikes so skateboard seemed like the logical thing to do.

I have always been a "board" guy. Started skating when I was around 10. Got into wakeboarding and snowboarding around 15. I have always thought about a powered skateboard. It seems that only recently (last 5 years or so) motors and batteries are powerful enough to actually get you somewhere at a reasonable speed at an affordable price. I took a break from car modifications and saved up the money I needed for my electric skateboard project. Really glad I found this forum!

I was looking for "last mile commute" solutions earlier this year. Found out that there is a very active and helpful community of DIYers. Got motivated and started learning how to skate/longboard in last July at the tender age of 55 (Probably the oldest dude here). Now will start my first build with my son very soon. Cheers to all !!!

I got into this addictive mess when I saw the Zboard demos on Youtube. WOW, I thought...Those look cool. So I did what I always do when I find something I like. I eye-guzzle every shred of information I can get my paws on until I find what I consider to be the ultimate. I'm a classic "purchase justifier", so everything has to have a good reason for being selected. The more I looked into the different offerings, the more I kept wanting more. Then I found the Enertion website. BOOM!! Mind blown...I kept looking and found DIY...Sweet, a stateside vendor!!...Decided to start ordering some parts and get my build on. Collecting hobbies is sort of my forte. I can tell this addiction is going to be one hell of a ride!! No pun intended...

also, i would like to point out that this is definitely a part of my midlife crisis. My boards are basically my dumb blondes and corvettes. That keeps my wife happy... -er. She's still worried about me killing myself on these things, but like i always say... if you gotta go... go doing something you love, and i'm not going to feel or look this good forever, so NOW is the time to ride fast.

I'd spent the last 10 years of my life absorbed in bike racing and then got some mysterious injury and not only missed the thrill of speed but no longer could even ride to commute.  
Weird how the info sneaks up on you but as soon as the possibility was found on the web I was all in 

Now I add to the commute for fun and still get the thrill of racing the bikers.  It's not a fair race anymore. I fly by and turn around to see them all out of the saddle chasing. Awesome. 

The only games I'll play are chess, a lot, or asteroids or pacman.

I saw a gas powered Goped at a county fair when I was around 10 (currently 33) and always wanted to build one with bigger wheels that I can take off road. Early 90's is when I started skating and only had the money for cheap popsicle boards but always wanted a longboard and some bigger wheels. In 2003 a friend found a Tom Shanahan Powerboard at a garage sale and we made some deal, I think I traded a vintage sony turntable, so I ended up with that. 15mph, six wheels, four of which I still have, 115mm, and more fun than I had ever had on a board! The rear axle melted on it and it didn't last more than 60 miles. I kept it for about a year but didn't have the resources to fix it. I actually quit skating in 2008ish because I realized everyone I knew with a board was either a junkie, a child, or had children, no body was in it for cruising and having fun, it was all just flips and grinds in a single place and talking about how much they hate EVERYTHING (because skating is what you do when you can't afford drugs). In 2010 I took a "vacation" (nervous breakdown) to Albuquerque and Roswell NM (from Ohio) and discovered that longboards aren't just some novelty thing to own, so after some much needed sunlight and downhill therapy, I went back to Ohio and started buying longboards.
"Hey, look at that retard with the big-ass deck! Do a kick flip, retard!" There is no place for me in Ohio, so now I'm in Vegas, and after two years of research and blowing up ESCs I have a board that makes me happy. I can remember the exact moment I saw the Alien Drive motor mount in 2014, my entire life did this epic carve to get back on the path I didn't realize I had chosen 23 years ago. Most are into e-skate just for entertainment/hobby, this is a lifestyle for me, this is almost a religion.

I spent most of my 20's directing music videos for every rapper around at the time. I also shot some commercials, was nominated for some MTV/BET awards and was in a Sprite commercial once. I eventually got jaded by the entertainment industry and of being pigeon holed as a music video director so I started my blog RunPlayBack as a way to share my DIY video experience with others and to create a conversation for anyone who shares a passion for storytelling and filmmaking. As a native New Yorker, the creative scene got pushed to the side by the finance bro's and that eventually led to an opportunity to work with a tech startup in Ann Arbor, MI. With a much greater quality of life and plenty of space to ride, I got into eboarding to sharpen my DIY skills and to also have a way to create video content that doesn't involve storyboarding a treatment or waiting to get approvals. I think eboarding to me is about capturing the emotions of riding more than anything.

Also esk8s make killer camera dollies. With a solid gimble or even just a steady hand you can capture some killer action footage of other people on bikes, skates, and boards.

I was visiting my now ex in Australia. She said they had to walk everywhere because they didn't have a car. I replied with walking is for chumps and decided to skate. But she told me there were a lot of hills and that would suck to go up. So I said. " don't worry. I'll just put a motor on it." Then I googled how to do it. The rest is history.
