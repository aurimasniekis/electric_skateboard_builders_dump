I have a Mac and I love it but I come from a graphic design and photography background and macs are they best for media related stuff. I feel like enertion should have built the Mac software before they released the unity especially if they are putting on the website that it is Mac compatible. 

They said that they don’t have cost effective way to work on the software.... What??? Maybe just buy a Mac and start building the software because you said there would be a Mac app and Mac software and yet the unity was beta tested without a Mac user being on the bet team and now neglected. @Kug3lis made a Mac tool but I’m not sure it works fully. I went out of my way to build MacOS on a virtual machine that would be totally free and sent a full link to how to do it to @Deodand. Which I understand that he is more focused on the firmware aspect but someone should be able create the software. They have one for the focbox.

@Deodand Ok this what the only post I made in this thread. And there have been multiple people who have complained about the lack of Mac support on something enertion said would have Mac support. People have linked to @Kug3lis post on the unity thread but even he wasn’t sure it would be perfect. Enertion should not rely on the community to do your work for you.I don’t want to load boobcamp because that is just a workaround and those are just band aids. How can you say that there is a iOS app on the website when there isn’t. I even built and tested out a virtual Mac build thought I was doing a nice thing by sending you the link.

Answer me this why didn’t you send a unity to a Mac user to have a beta test done?

[/quote]

As a developer it makes sense. In order to release an App for IOS/OSX, you need to pay the $100 developer fee a year and that's on top of getting a Macbook (though an iMac is better for fully focused os development) that's now $1000+. Sure you *could* work on a virtual machine for MacOS, but knowing Xcode, it is *not* going to take it very well. It's already an annoyance to get it working at natively (damn you playgrounds!). 

And this is not anything new. When the VESC Tool first came out, [it did not have an OSX version](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/vesc-project-com-is-online-public-vesc-tool-download/32268/9?u=jc06505n) until it was [compiled](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/vesc-project-com-is-online-public-vesc-tool-download/32268/11?u=jc06505n) by @rpasichnyk. Same for the Ackmaniac tool. It was up to @rpasichnyk and @Kug3lis to compile it for OSX.

Yes I understand it can be expensive for the average person but they listed it as being Mac compatible and talk about a iOS app and then rely on the community to do your job. But with a virtual machine you can atleast start the work I was able to do coding on the virtual system I did without a issue.

You really don't understand the way the small businesses on the forum operate man. We don't have infinite resources so we have to focus our attention where it's needed most. We aren't doing small bespoke orders, we just shipped out like 500 motor boards in various forms, pretty much on time and the vast majority are working well. 

Rather than focusing on that you just have to come complain about a mild inconvenience during an early launch of a product. All of us are working insanely hard to make sure everyone is happy and cared for, so it doesn't really help when you complain about a problem that already has a workable temporary solution in place. Then other people are nice enough to come in and explain how difficult it is and you just ignore them"This thing here could have been done better". Of course it could have, we are like 4 people making a thing, nobody invested millions of dollars in us to hire a team of app developers. **People have just gotten so used to buying things from giant companies they come in with the same expectation from a small business and it just isn't realistic**. There will be a Mac tool. You know what will help us develop/pay for that ios tool? Sales. It's a chicken and egg problem for startups try and understand.

[/quote]

I meant for the Mac OSX (i don’t believe anywhere in my post i instituated the notion of virtualizating Xcode and only Xcode... hell I mentioned doing so for OSX  and then running Xcode from in the same sentence...) I assumed that the entire point of using a Virtual version of the Mac OSX was to developed natively for OSX. You can only do so natively (with swift or Objective-C) via Xcode...which *can* work with what @briman05 has mentioned.  

[quote="mikenyc, post:44, topic:78773"]

Agreed? It’s a point I use to answer anytime someone asks why it’s not:

https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/enertion-ios-app/75984/2?u=jc06505n

Anyone who can use the search function can easily find out why any variant of the VESC tool is not on The App Stores. 

What Im talking about in my post on this thread is the cost it takes to develop for apple officially, the potential annoyance of doing so with a Virtual OSX , and how the community has been compiling OSX software for VESC software for a while.

Apple is fine for the normal everyday person. However if you ever want to do anything different or cool forget it. Apple are rich prics that will only let you use their shit.
[/quote]

*Apple isn't even fine for the normal person*, becuase their practices make it much more expensive to innovate for consumers, which means we're being left behind as China pulls ahead because they can innovate quickly and cheaply without the Applecuffs on their hands.  *Those cuffs are put there by the millions of people who keep buying them as fashion accessories.*  It's pulling the entire tech sector down with it, slowly but surely.  I just told a customer Friday that if they wanted any apple anything in their new software project, I'm adding 100K to the price and they said they had to because their consumers have iturds.  Well, companies innovating in China don't have these added costs.

Enjoy, your decisions have consequences.  I hope you like third-world countries because you're very slowly turning yours into one each time you give money to apple.

I personally will not support a company that has to put a frikkin circus net around the building because too many people are jumping to their deaths. 

Apple litterally bought an entire city, if you don't work for Apple you have to leave your home as you cannot get basic services. If you do work for Apple there are no basic employment protections because, well, China. So some people barely make enough to eat much less provide for a family...hrnch death plummet to concrete. 

I mean, can you imagine death being a more palatable choice that going to work?

That's why I don't use apple. Beyond that the quality of hardware, marketing propaganda, closed O/S and huge fees to sell software that uses the apple platform. It's frikkin awful. 

I'm putting my soap box up now.

I don't get the hate :p maybe it's jelousy?

I had the Samsung Note 8 and iphone X last year and this year Samsung Note 9, iPhone XS and Huawei mate 20 Pro so I'm familiar with both systems. Android kinda feels like a early beta. 

The iPhones just work and does a great job of integrating everything and little is done half ass. For example with face id on the x everything was integrated nice from the beginning and I could sign into banking apps and everything with it. On the Huawei with same sensors it's done the Android way with implementing it half assed. Sensor hardware is amazing and quicker than Apple but software is lacking. I can unlock the phone with it and get some passwords but mostly it can't be used to authenticate on apps. List of shit like this is long. I use both but I really do prefer the iPhones when I'm not in the mood for fiddling to get even the most basic shit to work. 

Should I bring up Notifications, Icloud, memory leaks or battery efficiency?

Feeling a bit hostility man. Though I do want to write a fantasy franchise sometime in the future. One that deals with people channeling the power of mythological gods and beings. A bit of Supernatural Mets Percy Jackson. 

Back on topic. Maybe I’ve gotten something wrong here in my previous post. If so it’s better that we sort any misinformation I have on my part and may have gave onto others. So hopefully someone would see the rundown of my points and correct me where I’m incorrect: 

1. In order to officially release a product on the App Store one needs to pay a $100 annual developer fee. 

2. In order to develop native iOS and OSX applications one requires a MacBook which can run up to $1000 *or* OSX 

3. One can obtain OSX through the means of a Virtual OSX , and *then* from there, can use Xcode. 

4. Xcode is at times a finicky piece of shit even on Apple hardware (though that’s what happens when you have shit loads of storyboards) 

5. My main idea of my first reply to @briman05 we’re about the whether or not it was truly cost effective to develop OSX applications, especially so when equipment is needed to be gathered. 

6. I then later extended upon the history of VESC configuration tools in the community and how it was often up to the community to compile it and release it for OSX , not the community. 

What I’ve said above has nothing to even do with writing code. It has everything to do with how one can start up writing official native OSX applications , the cost of it, and how the community deals with the VESC tools being GPL lisenced.

Ah see this doesn’t help me. All it tells me is that something (or all things) of what I wrote is wrong but you’re not pointing out what and why. And I can’t see it cause everything I written is well... true. There **is** a $100 annual fee, there **is** a way of using Xcode via Virtual OSX , and Xcode **can** be finnacle even when run on Apple hardware, especially so on intensive projects. So running it in a Virtual envoirment May not be the best course of action.

It's my personal opinion that there should be a $50 surcharge for apple software if you want that.  So each Unity costs $50 more if you want apple stuff for it.  ***Because I don't want the rest of the world to have to pay more and wait longer for innovation to happen**, just because some uninformed folks decide to feed the beast.*

As someone who works in the software industry, and with all due respect, fuck apple.  They are dragging down our entire industry by making it expensive or not possible to innovate, and they are doing it intentionally.  It's no accident.

Buy apple trash, play apple games.  Just don't slow down innovation for the rest of us.

Yes , though not in the same sense as @rpasichnyk ( I do server side queries and work with SQL Databases). But even then I’ve played around with Swift since it’s my favorite language ( haha but Optionals and Extensions are God, and the resources to learn data structures with playgrounds is something I wish would be taught in Uni Classes since they’re so intuitive and forgiving to use). 

But the things is , none of what I’ve said has to deal with writing code it self. It has *everything* to do with the needed equipment and *small* capital to do so. And if it does , please tell me as I may be ignorant in this regard.

I was raised with Apple - call me spoiled. 

I work with PC and android applications because the robotics program at my school requires a basic knowledge and all applications for machinery are run with the school’s PCs. So I can use most interfaces pretty well. 

I have an iPhone and a Mac and I like them because they do what I need them to do, but I agree with @mmaner that the way apple treats employees is awful, even if it is improving. My family still adheres to apple, but we don’t pay for the add-on services unless it’s music (my dad got some affordable package deal years ago for 25,000 songs on a family iTunes account, so we use that for most music and then Spotify for newer music and sharing playlists). 

Lately though, I haven’t seen any products that have been truly innovative, even AirPods (Apple’s bestselling product this holiday season) are just existing tech that was revamped to work seamlessly with the Apple ecosystem. Their stock is reflecting that lack of eye grabbing innovation that they used to rocket to the top, and as someone who has a large portion of my college fund invested in them I’m quite concerned.

I completely agree, and the Apple Watch is a true example of that, being a better product that sells better.

Yet, Apple used to be the first to the market with big things like this and the fact that they have laid back and tried to be the “Fast follower” has caused wavering faith in investors and the general public, and a subsequent drop in stock.

I myself am happy to jump on the first to market bandwagon, and I’d prefer that Apple go back to being big and bold in that area.

Ah I see , but my post isn’t talking about compiling until the second paragraph, and that paragraph only takes about how it’s the community who does it and not usually the makers. My first paragraph just talks about what it means to develop *native* OSX/IOS applications. This is my fault of not asserting that I’m talking about making OSX/IOS applications in general and then pointing to how makers releasing everything else but a OSX application isn’t something uncommon.

They kinda still are if making it proper first is your definition of innovation. Innovation just isn't as big when they made the first proper smartphone. There where smartphones like sony with the p-series and blackberry before iPhone launched but they released something that was way better. 

Faceid is a good example where a lot of companies made attempts to make it work with camera and software. Nothing new again from apple but what's new is that they made something that works properly and is a good replacement for the fingerid. 

Apple watch was also nothing new but it was just made properly and worked so it got big quick. 

Icloud was not new but it's without comparison when it comes to beeing user friendly and backup even the smallest setting, photo, app and so on.

Airpods.. Not new but when they first make it its without all the hassle and fiddling to pair Bluetooth it just works. They got good battery life, decent sound and are small. Excellent mic quality for handsfree use. 

I wouldn't call Apple innovative but when they sell  something it works and it often has a more polished user experience.

Because most big titles release on ios first.

Because ios actually has tablet optimized versions of apps.

Because apple smartphones and tablets get 5 year software updates.

Because the resell value of all apple devices is way better.

Because allmost all apps are pretty much the same on ios and android.

Because iphones have the fastest cpu's on release and 6-18 months ahead.

Because android/ios tablets and smartwatches don't even compete in the same world.

Because the mac/ipad/iphone/watch actually have nice integration and continuity.

Because Apple laptops and tablets have the best battery live in the business.

Because Apple laptops have the best screens in the business for color.

Because I like the sleek designs.

Because it's personal preference.

The freedom is a good argument in a tiny window of instances. The unity software will be available later yes. OMG I SHOULD CHANGE MY LIFE AND THROW  AWAY ALL MY APPLE HARDWARE.

Can't we just peacefully live besides each other? People who wan't good hardware and hobo's?

In reality I'm a windows user at home, switch between android and ios phone every 2 years. And use a Macbook pro professionally. When I advice friends what phone or laptop to buy it's usually an android phone that doesn't cost 1000 dollars and a windows laptop that has good bang for buck. I'm just not as poor as my friends (I'm joking).

And ofcourse

Corporations aren't friends, they are in business to make money.  Period.  All of them.  It's actually a breach of fiduciary duty and illegal for an executive team to something that doesn't further that goal.  It's up to consumers to support what is good in our world.

The problem is apple chooses to do that by making software development and innovation more expensive, and they do it on purpose.  Do you think Chinese software innovators have to deal with apple crap?  They don't.  They can freely innovate.

That means, in the long run, they have an advantage over us.  Because a lot of us drink the Kool-Aid.

Lol about having to actually pay for it 🙃

Let's talk about what could have been done with iOS just to make it a tiny bit more usable... 

- fingerprint ID home button is crippled, why not make it a proper multi function button? A simple "touch to go back" in addition to the known "press to home" would improve it tremendously. "double tap" to multi-task would also be great. "Keep pressed to lock screen". That's *ergonomic*, Meizu has done it for years

- horizontal the shit outta multi tasks, so you don't need both hands to close down apps by swiping in a natural direction. Sometimes originality sucks 🦆

- stop asking iTunes ID for every damn app update, what's the point really

- Do like Google, just offer free picture storage in the cloud. 

- get downloaded documents running and share through USB ; allow copy paste to the phone

- Ever heard of keyboard swipe / SwiftKey? Cause we're closing in 2019. Edit : thanks to @jadatmag for the info, this one is actually available. That's a huge step forward! 

List can go on, but just these upgrades would turn half assed iPhones into great phones.

I don’t think corporate profits are bad. They pay for innovation. Apple isn’t making innovation more expensive. Quite the opposite, I know many who make a nice living building apps for their store. They do insist on a uniform experience for costumers. The high dollar application sales are on the Apple platform.

I build software that runs on Windows and Macintosh. I use both every day. Everything about Mac is better, from the development environment to the OS. But if you don’t want to use Apple then there is always Android. Stolen from Apple, BTW.

I love apple products you don’t have to have a app in the App Store to download something to a Mac it just has to be compatible. If you want something on your phone or iPod or iPad then yes you need to do it by the App Store. Macs are great because they basically do not get viruses. Yes they can get them but it is so much easier on a windows system. One of the most photographed building in NYC is the apple store that is the glass cube. Apple has a solid and refined look to them. Plus safari is awesome and has been the default browser for years windows default browser is internet explorer.

£2699 for a MacBook with the same spec as a £1200 Lenovo. Think that Apple user will be getting a new laptop every year? Probably not the majority.

So the software needs to be backwards compatible with systems upwards of 5 years old to ensure these extremely high priced computers can be used for over half a decade. That stifles innovation Bill. 

You'll know that the majority of computing breakthroughs (post initial pc release) came before shit got super expensive and hardware was easy to upgrade and fix. Software development was rampant because hardware could keep up and enthusiasts weren't afraid of pushing the boundaries.

Call all you want but it's true. I'm replying from a Huawei Mate 20 Pro now in fact.. I use this and a iPhone xs and have changed between them. Once I get tired of fiddling to get things to work I switch back to the Xs for a little while since stuff just work there. 

Some of mate's weak points. Many of them true for Note9 also. 
-memory leak. Phone has to be rebooted else apps don't get memory after a while. 
-camera sucks. It works good sometimes but most are worse than the iphone. Software issue tho that get improved (not fixed) on next update and that brings me to my next point. 
-software updates are slooooow. I'll admit I don't know how it works but I'm not getting the latest updates on my device. On xda forums I see people are getting both 2 and 3 versions before I get them. When trying to force a update It says I'm at the newest. On the iPhone I get them when everyone else does even on old devices. 
-rooting is not possible(!!) so I can't force the updates. Even if it was a forced one through rooting it would mean giving up on the Google signed version and Google pay among other thing wouldn't work. 
-apps just isn't made as well as on the iPhone. Take Instagram that can't get the proper aspect ratio as an example or how Snapchat often stutters if you open the app quickly and trying to send a movie. Moment is often gone when I realize the video got fckd. Facebook use a in-house gallery function that doesn't sort photos on exif shot date like the phone gallery so everything is messed up. I could go on like this for a while lol.
-when using another phone than the iPhone I get reminded on how awesome Icloud really is. I login with my username and pw and that's enough to have me setup like my old devices and everything is neatly integrated and backup is working. No fiddling.. Even after fiddling with Google to backup my images/phone and some Huawei integrated stuff also it didn't manage to get my settings back properly when I had to do a reset to try to fix the memory leak mentioned above.. The most basic things just doesn't work out of the box or even when I try to set it up so it should work. To be clear it took some backup but just not everything like Apple does.

List could go on but you prolly get the idea. Have you used a iPhone for your personal use for a while? I'm activly using both but most of the ones bashing the "other" have just tried it at the store or on a friend's device or just read it on a forum that it's shit..

The reason I like a android device is to fiddle basically. For work I just use an iPhone because I won't get paid for playing with a phone to get it to do my daily job. It's also nice with hardware options and some of the apps are not to be found on both devices. Since I have both I always have the option to try the apps.

Sure, but that's actually wrong in itself. Apple pushes the Cloud over customers on every occasion since it is very direct implementation. That's basically saying "Pay me more or I limit the uses of what you bought and will remind you of it".

I always found docs to be a real hassle to transfer from and to iPhone if it's not a basic photo ; can't plug the damn thing and access it without iTunes so if, for example, you Swat a printing office with no data access on your phone and said office doesn't have iTunes on its computers (why would it?), your phone will fail at being a USB storage to retrieve your documents from.

Nothing about the iPhone has been so “Gosh Darnnit” enough for *me* to want anything else.

That's the magic. When you're used to iOS, it makes you oblivious of what other platforms can offer. I used to be like that. 

Actually I had / have various iphones models in my family (I dropped after the 5 but my mother keeps harassing me with both iphone 5S, then 6 Plus, then 8 plus now). Only model not in the fam is the X.

Then there's the thing, my first android phone was a Sony Z1.

Basically when I wanted to drop my iPhone 5 I had to **Pay** an app to save and transfer basics from my iPhone to my mail box. At this time for any iphone save/install, iTunes and computer were mandatory.

Here's the feat : I buy my Sony, launch it while getting out of the store, follow the steps and **BOOM** : before crossing the security doors, all my contacts, mailboxes etc were already loaded in my phone. No computer, no hassle, no iTunes, just *magic*. A real one this time, not a *smoke screen*. 

It blew all my expectations given how restricted IOS was. Quality phone, quality system and sleek functions, nice camera, a true battery and waterproof? Ah, swipe was already a thing while SwiftKey was released in 2017 for Apple users.  

This was back in the days. Android has improved so much since then, and so have phones. So did Apple's products but they missed some steps. 

When I now compare my XZ2 with iPhone 8, we'll damn there's still not a single reason I'd come back to an iPhone for my own use. Not one.

How much did you drop in your last PC laptop? What did you buy? That's directly relevant to hardware quality there IMO, and there's apples and pineapples based on what your wallet allows. 

Tho you can't by an Apple with a pineapple wallet, you need a premium one :laughing:

Just a side note : I'm not hating on Apple's products but on the choices the company made for them. I almost got the iPad pro with Apple pencil last month. It takes me a lot to be impressed by a gadget. And this one did, there's no other tablet on the market who brings a close experience period. Damn it even has an USB-C well done Apple. 

@Jc06505n if the X has similar gestures than the new Ipad pro, I get why you aren't bothered with multi tasking cause that's the only one I found to be intuitive with no "wrong moves" redundancy. 

But after searching a lot I realized it couldn't meet my uses despite having enough computing power to do so. Again.

And that's disappointing from Apple.

Does that mean iOS is in _early alpha stage_? No, it simply means iPhones and Android phones are smartphones, as tiny efficient computers with pretty advanced features in a slim "hot inefficient potent" package and these can fuck up sometimes.

So, I must politely still call **BS** :beers:

You sir must be unique :slight_smile:

I'm running both iPhone xs and Mate 20 Pro over the last 3 weeks and I haven't booted my iPhone once and I didn't have an app crash either. In comparison the mate needs a daily reboot due to the memory leak and apps crash on a regular basis like the one I just sent a screenshot on. Before the Mate I had a Samsung Note9 as a android device and it was way better on bugs and didn't have a memory leak but it was still having the beta feeling over it. 

Everything is software issues tho. The hardware itself is amazing. Imagine a mate with 4200mah battery on iOS. It would prolly run for 4-5 days with that battery. Now it last me about one day 😂

One thing I hate the most is fanboys start pushing they religion on people. I am talking both apple fan boys and against apple fanboys. It is like religion, whatever you like or believe do it at home don't go pushing around it to other people because sometimes all those haters and lovers look like those guys who go around people houses and promote their religions and shits.

There are people who will decide on their own what they want and what they like but please don't involve 3rd parties in your rants why X is better than Y or etc. In the end, people choose what they like and they don't go around and try to influence everyone to switch to their religion.

If you change the world from e.g. apple or android or lumia or etc stuff to religion names and take a look at what you are writing it would look like you are promoting your religion switching your whole families to it and etc stuff. 

There will be always communities or diversion on anything you pick and people will choose what they like but for god damn sake keep your religion and fanboyism in your own closet and do go around the internet and like:

_U idiot because you have iphone_ 

_My iPhone can solve all my problems and etc_

Because nobody argues which hair shampoo is better on the internet as nobody gives a fuck what brand shampoo you use at home.

So please let's understand each other that people have their own choices and they choose what they want instead of making hundred post topics where people create 21st age religion wars over fcking Computer/Mobile phone brands and etc stuff. 

**I am sorry for the ranting** I am just getting really upset than religious fanboys start arguing what is better. 

I work with multiple platforms, have to support multiple processor architectures like ARM/RISC-V and etc stuff and I am not going to complain around like why the fuck you use RISC-V then you can just go with ARM core as it solves the same problems you have and etc. 

So lets just keep this topic on the rails and not involve in hundreds of posts trying to argue why X is better than Y.

P.S. I just compiled FocBox Unity on Mac I didn't change any code just basically ran `make` command and uploaded the resulting `dmg` file online. I don't really have time or resources to go over and figure out why some stuff doesn't work. My closest guess regarding `Resource is busy` error is that something has already connected to that USB (serial port). Regarding `Bluetooth` I highly doubt it will work out of the box, as OSX Bluetooth support highly differs from standard Linux/Windows implementations.

Would you do a some bug solving for the OSX version you compiled if they send you a free unity? And let them put that version on their website?

My MacBook Pro I got was a back to school special if you had a .edu email so I paid like 850 for it. The last pc laptop I got I was a hp and paid around 950. And it slowed down pretty quickly.

I had a HP DV7 when I was a freshman ; it lasted 3 years before falling apart (keyboard dead, PSU dead, battery died first). 

Next I bought an MSI GS70-20d first Gen in 2013. Loaded it with a SSD (Lite-on LMT 256 I think). i7 / gtx765m 8go RAM. 

This thing was unkilleable, even after breaking it in two pieces I'd still hook a HDMI cable to it and it'd perform just as new. I kept using it till this summer, August 2018. 

Of course I killed the battery in the long run, who doesn't when you use a laptop for CPU intensive apps, 3D rendering and gaming + charge / discharge it multiple times on a daily basis? The rest kept working flawlessly. 

New replacement is an MSI GF63, and given the quality build of the previous one I think this one will hold its own for years too. 

What I mean is : 
- Hewlett-Packard sucks at making reliable laptops and any price paid for it is too expensive
- MSI rocks at it and actually makes huge deals for days like Black Friday etc
- More seriously apples and pineapples again, PC brands are world apart despite pricing, it is hard to know firsthand without taking a gamble. 

What I give you tho is that Macs are unified, there's no downfall in quality between each model and that's a strong benefit of Apple's ecosystem.

Sure, but that’s actually wrong in itself. Apple pushes the Cloud over customers on every occasion since it is very direct implementation. That’s basically saying “Pay me more or I limit the uses of what you bought and will remind you of it”.
[/quote]

I’m mean sure , that’s one way of looking at it. But that assumes in the basis that each consumer is entitled to certain things. But consumers are only entitled to the terms that consumers agreed upon. And Apples terms are a certain portion of the cloud and if you want more you’re going to have to pay. I’m not going to drive whether it’s right or wrong since that’s business, and if Apple feels like such a model works best for them , monatary wise then 🤷🏾‍♂️. I know I for one don’t really care since I have numerous places I can put files wherever need be.

In comparison Google drive is non intrusive yet super complete, packs unlimited photo storage + 15gb of free space. Then on top you can pay for more space if you want.

![image|521x500](upload://3eMoIaKcFwH3Lh3T3SenKON3RIt.jpeg) 

lets be real here , everything and anything made by google that you’re not paying for is used. Whether it be location , photos , documents, goggle is using. Hence why in its terms and services it grants it self the right to use or modify whatever you put in. Anybody who has yet to understand this by now , by *2018* we’ll then:

I always found docs to be a real hassle to transfer from and to iPhone if it’s not a basic photo ; can’t plug the damn thing and access it without iTunes so if, for example, you Swat a printing office with no data access on your phone and said office doesn’t have iTunes on its computers (why would it?), your phone will fail at being a USB storage to retrieve your documents from.
[/quote]

True, though I never want to ever plug my iPhone into any other computer but mine. Usually if needs be I would print straight from the iPhone if it’s a smart printer. Or I would just airdrop the document to my MacBook (It’s always on me) and print from there. Or I would do what people have done since the 2000 and email themselves and print from there. There’s also iCloud which I *can* access from anywhere any browser , but I never have to go that far. I can see how it’s easier for Android , but it’s not an annoyance for me since I have an AirPrint printer at home and if I’m at work... well any document I’m about to print is in my work computer

[quote="Vanarian, post:93, topic:78819"]
That’s the magic. When you’re used to iOS, it makes you oblivious of what other platforms can offer. I used to be like that.

Ah see this here is the problem. You’re taking my contentness and calling it ignorance. As if *you* know what’s best for me. As if whatever ecosystem I have here doesn’t serve *my* needs , as if *I* don’t enjoy the features on *my* phone, as if I *need* something more. If I want something more , then I would get some, it’s not like having an iPhone magically stops me from doing so , I gave every capacity to do so. But **I** like what **I** have. And if I want more **I’ll** get more.

That was not my intention and I'll gladly accept that it serves your uses. After all I'm biased by my own opinion and also by meeting too many apple fans keyboard warriors over the likes of YT and Reddit, so I'll apologize for the patronizing.
