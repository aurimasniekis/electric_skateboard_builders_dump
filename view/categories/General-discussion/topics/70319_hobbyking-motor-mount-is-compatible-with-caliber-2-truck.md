You have to file the rounded part of the hanger but yes it will fit.

Ok, so you put it on right, and this side is cool, all good, two sides touching...

But this side isn't cool, only one side touching and it's a nipple at best..gap is on the left, and it's HUGE!!

So I take that piece to the grinder cus it's faster than filing it down, but it gets hot, be careful, ouch!

OMG now it fits! Use this picture as a guide or grind and test fit over and over as needed. You do not need to grind the nipple further than the area it protrudes from.

Oh this particular cast caliber truck, a cal2 50, I needed to also file this small section on the hanger to allow for a perfectly aligned belt.
