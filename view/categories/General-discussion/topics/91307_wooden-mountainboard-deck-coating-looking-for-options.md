Hello

I bought a MBS Comp95 boards and I wanted to reshape it and remove the design.
After cutting out some mqterial, I sanded the deck to smooth the sides and remove the graphics on the board (not my taste). Here is the build log if you are interested in the result https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/reshaped-mbs-comp95-matrix-ii-metal-12s5p-dual-6374-170kv-unity-build-log/91273/2

I would like to have a coat of varnish/laque/Ã©poxy or anything else to protect the wood. 
Then, for the lower part facing the floor I want to add also a coat of rubber-like dip such as protect-dip or plasti-dip 

![IMG_20190420_192453|281x499](upload://jjc7UnWRNokVm9dITBD9g2btWq5.jpeg) 

For the first coat (protect the wood from weather / all terrain use), what would you advise ?

Also, does anyone have experience with rubber like coating on a deck ? I search for feedbacks, video and photos could not find any.

Thanks !

For protecting finish, go for Minwax satin/gloss polyurethane. I use it for some woodworking projects and on a couple decks as well and it works great! For the rubber coating you mentioned, what do you want to use it for? Additional protection? If you really want protection on a deck, use a 'truck bedliner' spray, and or a 2 component clear coat.

Rubber coating is protective, flexible and remove some of the vibration. Actually, truck bedliners and rubber coat are the same  In theory it looks like a ideal cover for a mountainboard but never heard about actual use yet. I will definitely try but as there is many brands and type I was looking one more time at some potential feedbacks.  Maybe, it will add too much weight to the board?
Thanks for the tip on polyurethane for the first coat!

Try googling polyurethane resin or epoxy. Its a two part chemical that you mix and it hardens. Im pretty sure this is what he is talking about

isn't too rigid when it comes to resin or epoxy? 
I wanted to keep the little flex that the deck already has as much as possible

Thin layer of epoxy... resin does cure more stiff and epoxy is supposed to be more flexible. There are also additives specifically to increase flexibility of epoxies...but there are too many for me to give you a name or anything.

I would second the bed liner though tbh... epoxy can be messy and if mixed wrong or just poor quailty you could ruin your board... i tried to coat a work bench in epoxy and its sticky like 2 weeks later. Bed liner can double as grip tape if right texture...couple guys used it here to coat there battery enclosures

Yea im one of them haha. 

Sprayed bedliner on enclosures for protection, and paint + 2k clear coat for the deck.

@Linny do you run a bedlining company or know a friendly bedliner? I've worked with people using that stuff and it strikes me as an ideal system for creating flexible enclosures. (layered up of course)

The brand I use is called Samurai paint, it's a brand that is from Malaysia and there happens to be a distributor here in Singapore. The good thing about these is that it comes in a spray can, popping one button punctures the catalyst and mixes the two. 

I would say you can try Rustoleum, they have bedliners as well, or even Line-x because that's the OG one. 

For Samurai paint, there's a video on how it fares compared to the competitor's brand. You could hit them up and ask if they distribute internationally, I think they do...

Hey that looks very good!! I will definitely go with this solution on the bottom (after some search Rust-Oleum sounds to be the best accessible solution for me) of the board and paint + 2K coating on top
Thanks guys!

I could not find 2K so I ended up buying the product bellow and apply a first coat.

![IMG_20190422_170855|281x500](upload://woUvB02pBh0IwjYTgr7EPzxgIc8.jpeg) 

Then I will spray some black Primer/Paint on the board and apply another coat of polyurethane.
