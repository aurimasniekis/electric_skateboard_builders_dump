I'm not sure how many of us owners there are but I thought it would be nice to have a thread to talk about maintenance maybe? I can't seem to get my bearings fitted on properly for example, also when the urethane needs replacement who do we go to, or do we make some ourselves?

The bearings in CarvON V2 will last for a good amount of time if treated well. You can apply sewing oil even without disassembling. Apply more oil, rotate it nicely, wipe out dirt that comes out and excess of oil and you are good to go!

I successfully changed the bearings (both 6805 and 608). To change 6805 you need to remove stator from the axle, for this you want to use a jaw puller (see post below)

I decided to try rubber sealed bearings 6805-2RS because they usually get less dirt inside. On the other hand they are not the best rolling. I wonder if anyone brave wants to try ceramic bearings ;)

After changing my V2 run smooth and quiet :heart_eyes:

You need to get the rotor magnets free of the stator. it looks like the magnets are just sticking to one side .

I kinda had to do this because so far this is the best experience I've had with any company, jerry from carvon was awesome and helped me to get these hubs running great again I definitely owe him and as soon as he lets me know how I'll have to make right on that. Now that I think about it I owe quite a few members on this forum who've helped me out I'm gonna have to really figure out something I can do to give back

remove the four screws that go into the plastic fan through the can and sleeve. Remove the sleeve, then pul the can off. It's that simple, shouldn't be too hard, but it takes a bit of force to get the can off. Be careful to not scratch the stator/magents as little as possible while pulling it off.

That's normal. You want to get the little and big bearing into place, and then you need to try to hold it centered (don't let it stick to one side) and push towards the truck.. The little bearing is tricky. But it can be done.

I think I've been riding my 2.5s a bit too hard? :) Been commuting NYC almost daily since Feb, about 7 miles round trip.

One motor developed a rattle, a magnetic "click" at a certain point in the rotation.

And on the other motor, I think I hit a pretty good pothole, dented the bell, broke one magnet and another came loose. Was riding with this horrible screeching noise. Jerry was suuuper helpful, I ended up emergency gluing the magnets back in with CA glue and baking powder. Proper magnet glue ordered for if/when the CA glue lets go.

I've got cracks in the plastic fan (I think the weakpoint of this setup), glued together now with the magnet glue. The rest of the design seems surprisingly solid.

Motors are almost too hot to touch at the end of each leg of the commute. I just got bluetooth+phone app working, and wow I pulled 1900w on one motor at some point.

Motors are running a bit rougher and slower now, but can still hit 30mph. Seems I've been abusing these things pretty terribly, both mechanically and electrically. These things are tough. :)

So now I worry about breakdowns, downtime, and potential big injury. :) It seems inevitable that something will break. Being a commuter board, I'm starting to stockpile spare parts. Hard to get spare Carvon motors though!

Then there is just the axle nut and the 4 screws around the can at the back of the motor. Once those are all out you can wiggle the can off but be careful with the fan. If you pry too hard it will crack. Most of mine wiggled off by hand with a little time and patience.

Holly smokes..the whole motor still sits tight as fuck. I cant move shit. How should i pull it off ?? Should I pull the black can or the silver ?

The black section is a sleeve attached the steel can. Its attached with glue, it shouldn't come off so you can pull on either really. Look in the little screw holes on the back to see if you are making progress.

How about a little penetrating lubricant and keel using elbow grease.

I know it's used for pulling the stator but so far I've managed to pull the can just a tiny bit away from the plastic fan so I've figuered I would be able to catch the can between the fan with the puller so I think the puller might work for the can aswell. Hmm lubricant oil ..i could use that but won't it harm the windings if it gets between ?

Its possible but I dont know to be honest. I can say that ive put WD40 in my inner bearings many times and never had a stator fail beacuse of it. A little goes a long way so maybe you can use an eye dropper and just put a little right around the edge of the can? If it doesn't work at least it might help it come off with the puller with less force.

What we use is a one part high heat epoxy that needs to be baked for 45 minutes at 266 F. Don't know how hummie finds these things, but it works great. Very strong, very high heat, magnets will never come off like this with our stuff.

It seems that what was holding everything together was the FAN that was glued to the can. What I did is I've used super small screwdriver and used it in the holes where the small philips screws were and just levered the whole thing. Once it popped out of the fan it was fairly easy to take it off.

Haha it got rid of the terrible screaming screeching in that motor, but the clicking was in the other motor.

The Loctite stuff is hard to find and expensive, but it's actually designed to hold magnets onto motors. I'd use that if you can.

You have to be careful about how thick the glue is, vibration and heat resistance, etc etc.

The clicking is your bearings, that's what's so nice about the new carvon hubs, you have easy access to both bearings and can remove them, for the v2 and 2.5 you need a jaw puller to access the clicking bearing

In my case I really doubt it's the bearings ..I am 100% it's the missplaced magnet...I've checked the bearings and it all seems just fine..I'll let you know tonight after I apply the glue to my magnet and put back everything together.

Dadadaaam!!! Boys @BigBoyToys @willpark16 @Michaelinvegas @deucesdown @evoheyax thanks for your help!! Mission accomplished my Carvon works smooth as a butter!! Just like brand new. No clicking.. just smooth. 

**Guys here is a quick tip from me for anyone in the future:**
**- to take your can off of that plastic fan, after you unscrew those small philips screws stick a thick needle inside the screw hole and use it as a lever to pull the fan off.**
**- to put the fan back inside the can, just align the can perfectly with the fan and use that front axle nut.just lock it on and the fan will pop in inside the can.**

I didnt have thermal epoxy, but i ve used some kind of high heat thermal glue. In the future if one of the other magnets will pop out I'll take out all of them and glue them back with that thermal glue. Besides that Carvon seem to be built as a german tank!! 

To celebrate my successful mission i am going back to MotorMax settings at 70amp. Jerry said thats safe and i see big difference between 60a and 70a when riding.

Hi there folks!

I was looking to get some advice with VESC settings for a single Carvon v2 motor I got from Jerry around mid 2016. It still runs like a champ. Originally I bought a little cruiser complete from him he was selling at the time that came with a 12s1 LifePo4 battery but that pack died at the end of last summer. The VESC is still good and the settings are pretty much the same as when he shipped it to me.

Since then I went with a new build. I have a 18650 Battery Pack with Samsung 30Q cell 
BMS is rated for 30A Continuous Amp Output and 80A Peak Amp Output from . I also changed up the build from a small cruiser to the Landyachtz EVO deck. 

Anyways with those changes I was hoping to see if anything should be changed based on my config below or any tips from those who are still rocking an old v2 or 2.5? I believe I could up the motor max to 70 A but I don't want to fry anything. Additionally any tips for making the breaking slightly more aggressive? I know weight can be a factor I'm at about 170 pounds.

Thanks for any help!

I think you're going to get this firmed up before anything else. What happens if you draw more than 30a? For how long?

Seems a shame to have a 30a bms when the cells can do 80a.

Are the magnets still holding up? I am in EU too, which glue did you buy? Did you find the right one at the end? Thx

 @rey8801 - Yes everything works perfectly !  It works as smooth as  brand new Carvons right out of the box. My glue was really weird. What I've got was a high temperature resistant glue that had a structure of "concrete"  ..it was really weird. But I think you can use any epoxy that is high temperature resistant. 

I am not sure what the brand I've got but I think was something like this:
