Hey guys anybody aware if  there's a forum for diy or pre-built  electric push scooters?.

Interested to see what's available as they are somewhat related to esk8. 

Can a electric push scooter use a vesc as a controller?

Anyone built one?

Cheers

Haven't built one but i believe you can use a Vesc as I've heard of people using Vescs for Ebikes.  Can't see why you couldn't use a vesc for an escooter as well.
