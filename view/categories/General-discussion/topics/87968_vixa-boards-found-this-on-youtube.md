Does it say the voltage they run anywhere? With 12s 10 amp hours 24 miles is probably doable for a lighter rider like me but I definitely don't like how they advertise that as "medium range" because most people in most conditions won't be able to get that.

It's got 9" tires is geared for speed not torque(41mph top speed) so I doubt even you can get more than 10miles on this thing. 24miles my average range one 107s with a 12.5ah battery lol
