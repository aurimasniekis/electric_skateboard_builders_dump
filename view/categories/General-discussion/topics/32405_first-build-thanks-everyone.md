I finished my first build and took it out for a spin yesterday evening. I just want to thank everyone on this forum for being absolutely awesome. The wealth of information on this site is the only thing that got me through it. I haven't had this much fun in years! I've never really ridden a skateboard before, but this just felt natural. After 30 minutes my calves were feeling the burn though; not sure if it's just because it's just me, or these bumpy NYC roads. 

Special shout outs to @mmaner, @flywithgriff, @JLabs, and @HTownBomber for supplying parts and help. Now if you'll excuse me, my morning commute just got a lot more enjoyable.

Good job brother.  Keep your legs loose and the leg burn will lessen.
