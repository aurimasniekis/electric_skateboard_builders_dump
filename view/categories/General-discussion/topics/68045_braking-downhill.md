Hi all!

I'm having a little issue when braking downhill. I'm using the @Ackmaniac firmware on a fsesc 6.6 and I noticed that when I go downhill I can't decrease the brake pressure. I can only release them. I don't have issues on flat surfaces.

For example, going downhill If I brake 80%, then I release them a little to 60% nothing changes it is still at 80%. If I release them to 0% then I can apply 60%.

Any idea how to fix this?

Iâ€™m on FOC, Iâ€™m using skullboard hubs 1 (65kv).

Here my specs, motor 60, brakes -40, battery 30, regen -15. I tried brakes from 20-100, and regen from -8 to -15 (it affected brakes only at max speed).

I hope I explained myself lol, it's Friday :smile:

annoying as fuck!   I bet its your remote.  I had that a lot.  the mini trigger shows the best at not doing this in my experience.  modulation.

Do you think it's the remote? I don't recall having this issue when I was on stock FW. Admittedly I've run the stock one only for few minutes.

supposedly the remote COULD do huge precision and you could have great control but its lost int the physical interface.  its like grand theft auto and going 200mph and controls that can move an eighth of an inch.  I'm always skidding or crashing in that game.

I think its just a quality of the remote.  try the mini trigger and see.  I think theres some adjustability on the esc but really the problem is the remote.

I have the mini trigger, and I don't get why happens only downhill.

i was braking down a couple of hundred meter downhill at 6% and had no problems rly, i could break harder or soften up to get more speed but no problems, i was running a focbox with a flipsky 4.12 over split ppm with that cheap 15â‚¬ mini remote.

Did you use the stock firmware or the ackmaniac?

```
-15 Amps for each FOCBOX results in -30A in total for the battery for your dual setup. Your battery is only recommended for 8A (i mostly recommend to set the max 50% higher for stronger brakes). But your battery is just too weak for that power. So when you brake i guess the battery overshoots already quite a lot. So the FOCBOX works then at the amp and voltage limits. And even of you reduce the throttle a bit you still overstressed the system already so that it still works on the limit. Once you release the throttle and brake again the battery has a short moment to breathe and works better then.
But that's only a guess.
Best would be you make a video with my app to see the relatime data while riding. By that we can have a very detailed look what is going on.

Another thing, the discharge rate for Sanyo 20700B is 15A according to the specs. 2p means I can do regen -15a on each vesc, Am I wrong?

Discharge does not equal charge. These are different numbers.

According to this: https://liionwholesale.com/products/panasonic-sanyo-ncr20700b?variant=30186936017
They have a max Continuous Discharge Current of 15A

Does it do it all the time or just on full charge downhill?  Could be over voltage.  That causes strange braking anomalies.

damn, everbody was hyping these sanyo but gotta be honest, 2a per cell recommended max charge is quite limiting, even the 30q can take 4a per cell.

So being a 10s2p I should be at -10 or -8 on each VESC?

They are a better option when buying the boards associated with them, meepo/wowgo etc but definitely not compared to 30q.

P count * max charge amp : 2.

Just 2A for each vesc. 4 will probably also work, but that is twice as much as the recommended charge rate.

I think you can put much more in for short periods as apposed to a stated continuous charge rate for all states of charge.

I really should get telemetry. I wonder what happens during one of my off-road downhill sessions where I am constantly on the brake. This sometimes lasts up to 5 minutes.

Yes. I used 4 in the past. As always, test under safe conditions, but try to find a spot that would correspond to your normal road conditions. Don't go blasting down a busy city street immediately :sweat_smile:

I observed the same thing with my brakes using 3.1 firmware and Akimaniacs tools, and NanoX remote. Dont know whats causing it but it seems the fw. Before, when I was on 2.14 FW and firefly remote and the brake was smooth at any speed coming down a steep hill. Now I have to release before I can change to weaker braking power.

Ok, I lowered it to -4A each, and I still have the same issue. I also got a DRV302 -_-, but everything seems working. Any idea why? See my metr.at here: [https://metr.at/r/xI7ah](https://metr.at/r/xI7ah)

I'm going to try the stock one this afternoon or tomorrow to compare the differences.

Seems that on my case is an issue with the @ackmaniac's firmware. I ran stock today and was working without DRV errors, a better torque, and finally, I'm able to brake downhill. I think I might have hit some kind of bug in the code because everyone usually prefers @Ackmaniac fw. 

Here my very slow/safe runs:

Well IT actually shouldn't. But it has an effect on the Motor behaviour. It smoothes the throttle and braking over the length of the Trigger.
At the end of @ackmaniac Post He explained it Well.
