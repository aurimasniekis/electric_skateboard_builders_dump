I am on my way home from an SF group ride that I had to leave early because my wheel went bald and popped the tube. 

These were stock MBS AT tires, and although I am aware that using off-road tires on asphalt grinds them down faster, I‚Äôm a little ticked that it cut off my day of fun especially since these wheels have **less than 100 miles** on them. 

So, knowing that I‚Äôm not buying MBS 8‚Äù off-road tires again and that I‚Äôll mostly be using this board for group rides on roads in the future, what would you recommend for the **longest lasting** street tire? I‚Äôm looking for 8 inch or less. Thanks!

P.S. hope everyone in Vegas is having a good time!

i've had the smallest pricklly thingy majiger poke my tire and pop the tube when it wasn't bald at all. a simple tube replacement/patch fixes all. hella annoying but what else can you expect with a tubed tire? 

i suggest carrying an extra tube or two every time you go on a fun long group ride!

I've got an extra 200x50 tube up here in mill valley if thats the right size and you want to get your board back in business quickly! i'd be happy to give it you.

bummer about your day at the group ride. :[

Longer lasting means harder compound, which results in a stiff tire that is less suitable for off-road but relatively efficient otherwise. 

I increase the pressure of these to 5-6 for touring and to 4 for a more comfy ride. All other tires I have tried (hard compound mbs and trampa tires) lasted less than 350 km sometimes as low as 150. These lasted beyond 1000 km. 

Control over loose big gravel is reduced/wheels start to bounce more rather than absorb the impact.
