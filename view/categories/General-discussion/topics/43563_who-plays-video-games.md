Alright, I know this is disastrously off topic from Es8, but why not?  I have so much fun on here, and due to the nerdy nature of this forum, I figure there must be a few of you on here who also like to play some games.  If not, why the hell did you click on this topic?

So I think it would be cool while I'm on the ole XBOX1 and blastin' bad guys to also be having a discussion about all of our recent projects, or upcoming es8 trends, or whatever beer I'm drinking tonight, or whatever.

So here is my thought, if you play video games and think it would be cool to link up with other people from the forum come here and post some thing like this:

**GAMING SYSTEM:** PC/XB1/PlayStation

**GAMER TAG:**

**GAMES I PLAY:**



For me:

**GAMING SYSTEM:**  XBOX1

**GAMER TAG:**  SendersGame

**GAMES I PLAY:**  Fortnite, Destiny 2, Player Unknown Battleground.



Somebody hit me up, post your tag, or let the community what you like to play when you're not building bad ass Electric Skateboards.

Doom? What is this? The early 90s :wink:
[/quote]

I should ban you immediately for concatenating the phrase "DOOM" with "what is this" but i'm just inflamed with hostility because somebody said something about DOOM that wasn't absolute praise and should be beaten with chansaws and shotguns and bats with Carmack's face on them. 

DOOM IS. I was up till past midnight on my daddy's 486 DX2 many a night with my headphones plugged into that sound blaster. I played all those levels 100 times and played all the DOOM 2 levels 100 more. 

i bought a brand new Dell when Doom 3 game out and now i have every doom pack that ever existed in my Steam collection. 

i bought DOOM for PS4 the day it came out. Some of the first riffs i learned on guitar were from DOOM. 

My favorite episode of Invader Zim is when they sing the DOOM song.

I used to play lots of videogames, but haven't played much for past 10 years.
Some time ago i started Chrono Trigger on SNES. The save corrupted when i were (i think) 2/3 of game.
Recently i started playing Fallout 4 on PS4. Somehow i skipped the Fallout 3. Oh well, they aren't in chronological order anyways.

Although i don't play much, i still make reproduction games for NES and SNES more than i spend time in playing :laughing:

I think I was 14 when my friends and I figured out how to changed the image files in DOOM, and made the bazooka shoot chickens and blood splatters became feathers. DOOM was literally the reason I ended up majoring in computer science!

I'm sure this hobby might turn a bunch of "kids" into certified engineers one day!

**I'll wipe the floor on any car racing game you want! Pick your poison, come and see** :japanese_ogre:  

Next I'll take you on Street Fighter, Soul Calibur, Left 4 Dead 2, Dirt 3 zombie mod... damn guys you're bringing back memories !

BTW my Steam and PSN ID should be **seventaliji** but not sure, need to double check.

Gaming since C64 over PCs, then PS3 (PC hardware upgrades were too much).

But then switched to real world gaming or "gaming" like FPV flying and also was huge on Ingress. Fun times.

Nowadays, no more time, gotta prioritize. Drones & esk8, I rather take it for a spin than look at Loading... screens. I still get and play some games after Steam sales heh ;)

I like those things. I have a full size coin op cabinet with a pc inside and lots of emulators. Mame mostly. Sadly I have no room for it where I live now and it is rotting at my bro's garage. I hope I can recover it Someday.

Not usually much of a gamer, hoewever I just picked up Until Dawn (I know late to the party) and it is so immersive and fun. It's almost like an interactive movie and all of your decisions affect the gameplay and story structure. It's cool for sure. Any other horror games out recently worth playing? I'm thinking maybe Outlast?

Greetings fellow Citizen! I was wondering if anyone else was going to bring this one up!
I'm mainly into open world exploration titles, hence games like Star citizen and Subnautica, though I've dabbled in most of the genres over the years. I'm currently being pleasantly surprised by the Mad Max PC game.
My opinion is that for a game to be worthwhile, it must be excellent in AT LEAST either story or gameplay mechanics. I think these days awesome graphics are really more icing on the cake.

I think being able to adjust to varying and sometimes unexpected speeds, angles, momentum, gravity etc. means sk8ers automatically adjust.

That would be wicked.

I find I'm pretty temperamental with motion sickness. E-skating I have no issues with. In my car I'm fine if I'm driving, but if someone else is driving I'll get car sick if I'm not watching the road. I'll get sick with some FPS games (COD, Crysis, etc) but not something like Overwatch (surprisingly) and I'm fine with all third person games. 

My guess is I won't be able to do VR for very long. Any guesses?

I played video games my entire life (mostly on PC, but had most consoles). As of 3 years ago I also started to make video games for a living, that's when I joined a mobile gaming tech company to lead their Engineering and Technology department - most fun I've had in all tech companies I worked at before.

Some of my all time favorites: Starcraft, Warcraft and (anything blizzard), Street Fighter, Quake, MOBAs

That's not what that statement means tho, you know that right? 
Dead= nobody's plays, no community 

Personally cod is boring to me at this point. 
I'm enjoying apex because it's finally something different to the BG platform.

I mean, sure, cant get my mind around apex though, just doesn’t click like cod 2. It still is dead compared to fortnite. Not promoting fortnite! Only thing in cod 2 that gets annoying is the amount of havkers on each server

It requires so much more teamwork. 
Playing with randoms is hard. 
Hard learning curve. It's not as noob friendly.  It really really rewards aiming more than most fps ive played. Having multiple well balanced classes with only 3 man squads, makes for fun tactical combinations while still leaving every combination with a week point. I'm sure it won't pass up fortnight anytime soon but that game is full of potato aiming gamers and 9 year old kids..... so who cares lol.

Exactly, it requires much more skill, and people simply don’t want to take the time to learn. I simply stoped playing because I had no friends who played, and I was just straight trash and would die on landing.
