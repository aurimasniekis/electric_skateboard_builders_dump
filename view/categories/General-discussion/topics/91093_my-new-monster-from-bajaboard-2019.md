Jota, classic motorcycle marque

Pantera, classic car marque

Very evocative naming

Probably the owners of the rights to De Tomaso and Laverda may not feel the same üòÅ

 U probably don't know Jota come from the British car racing company and Pantera is Italian, Portuguese and Spanish means Panthers (black or yellow feline ) in English. I don't think do u know nothing about that üòÇ.

I like it man, you basicly have my Evo set up on a Baja, prepare for the torque its brutal. There will be alot of brown stains in your pants even after you get used to it.

There‚Äôs a lot either of us doesn‚Äôt know...the point is historic Motorsport using names derived from that.

The edit you made bears that out ü•∞

Pantera = Panther who would have guessed? Motorsport 

Ok maybe Baja (racing event) are really into heavy metal

Man if u don't have one car off course that need be your priority, but I brought and I definitely don't regret is powerful and can easily move one car I so impressed with the quality of this board.

Did this board come from the factory like this or is it pre owned/used?

In the 2017, 2018 models, I don‚Äôt think they used Samsung 30q cells. May have changed. Or is it your plan to use 30q cells in the future?

Are you new to the diy side of esk8?  If so, welcome. 

If you end up modifying the drive train and battery, it‚Äôs all or nothing. The motor stock controllers are not modifiable. The stock remote cannot be used with different motor controllers. 

Nice board, good luck. Just some helpful info I suspect you will eventually want to know.

you seem to think everyone can just go buy themselves a 7k board. most budget boards on this site are well under 1k and its the best most people can afford.

Gotta say I love that grip tape, that board wouldn't look out of place if it dropped out of a NASA lander on Mars. Well ware, that's lovely.

Hi everyone,

I am new on this site... I have a GX4 2018.08 Bajaboard. I got it 2nd hand with 17miles on it.
Unfortunately about 2 weeks ago I decided to tinker with it and take a look under the "hood" so to speak.
I had just finished cleaning out the battery compartment and was putting the 900Wh 30Q battery pack back when it happened.... I did not pay to much attention to this little white & frayed wire coming out from the pack.. I should have known better (I am an Aerospace Engineer so I am a perfectionist with OCD). so as I was putting the batter back into the bay, the little white wire touched the "contactor". 

so now I am not 100% sure if my battery pack is still any good or where the this little white wire is to be attached to, but it seems like it is a loop that was not suppose to be out side the battery pack....  Nor do I know if the mother board is working properly since it seems to keep vibrating on me when I power it on.

So at this point I am giving up and looking to upgrade the mother board to the 2019 MB w/ Tank mode. buying the 1.1KWh battery pack, I am also looking to get the 110A controllers,  the 16T pulley.  I am not sure if I want to go with their motors just yet.  does anyone here have any suggestions on motor upgrades?  I want to stay with 6374, but I am not sure which motor would  be an upgrade to what Baja is offering since they have not revealed the specs to their motor.  I have asked, but they are staying silent.. 

my playground is sunny silicon valley CA where the weather is always nice.
and I am looking for more top speed. I use my board to commute to work and everywhere in Santa Clara county.

YES I am used to speeds in the high 30mps to low 40mph.  I first started speeding with a VISA Dirtsurfer about 15years ago when only gas was available.

All suggestions on upgrading the motors would be welcomed.

Thanks
```
