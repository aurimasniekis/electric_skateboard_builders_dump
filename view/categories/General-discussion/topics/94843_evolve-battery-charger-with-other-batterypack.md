I am making a 10s 5p battery pack using evolve bms etc can i still use the original evolve charger to charge ?

Also making 10s 4p is that also possible. 

Cheers for any input

Of course, it's the same voltage so you can use any 42V li-ion charger as long as the amp output is within the battery packs tolerance, which a 2 or 4A evolve charger defenitly is
