I am looking to build a small 6s2p lithium ion battery pack. I came across this BMS and was wondering if it would work for my build. If not, does anyone have suggestions?

It won't, since it's a 7s BMS and with 6s I'd rather go for a 60A capable BMS.

Yes, but their technical details are not very detailed, would be good to know a little bit more, like continuous current, min/max voltage, max. charging A, etc.

Here's another I found with much more detail but the overcharge limit and undercharge limit seem high/low.
