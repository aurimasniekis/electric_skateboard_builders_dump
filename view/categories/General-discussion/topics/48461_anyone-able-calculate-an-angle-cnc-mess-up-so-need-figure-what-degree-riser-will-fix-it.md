So what are you trying to level the messed up mounting face to? 0° to the surface of the deck?

Yeah I think so. I used a trig calc lol, I forgot how to do trigonometry, even though I learnt it only last year.


@stormboard1 te calc said the angle is 26ish 
degrees

If it's 10cm length and 2mm one side and 7mm on the other, that's a rise/run of 1/20 
To calculate the angle (Ø): use inverse tan or atan on a calculator

tan^-1(opposite/adjacent)=Ø
tan^-1(1/20)=2.86°
Ø=2.86°

2.86° is the angle you need.

26ish

26 is way off man

Edit: This is assuming 7mm and 2mm were measured at the very corner
Confirmed on fusion 360 too.

Nah my algebra and all other maths is good, I just usually forget 1 or 2 topics by the next year if I do not use them much. I think I need to reread my notes book. Hmm so 30Qs are the new bitcoin lol

ya tryna get  to level 0 degrees
7mm is deepest edge and 2mm the opposite smaller edge

Haha yea I'm joking. I used to go to a Cambridge education based school in Singapore where they teach all the topics in a single year, getting harder and harder every year instead of drilling one topic per year like they do here in the US. That's how I remember all of my topics. IMO the Cambridge system is way better.

Yes that sounds quite similar to what they do here in Aus. Although they don't repeat on all subjects just algebra and the common things

I don't want be insulting, but..... come on man, you _really_ need to spend more time typing and proofreading your posts. I had to read it about 5 times to work out what you were going on about because of missing words and a severe lack of punctuation. You don't need to be a grammar or spelling expert, you just need to read your own post before you post it AND USE PUNCTUATION.
