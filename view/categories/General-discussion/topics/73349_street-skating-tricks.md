Who else likes street skating and not just riding a luxury sedan on skate wheels?  Not that many threads on it out there.  I've been skating 25 years and am just too old to take any more damage so I just cruise now but I still like doing the basic tricks. My board is a whole lot heavier but I can ollie up smaller curbs, drop off curbs and can manual for as long as my battery lasts.  It looks pretty dope doing a manual up a hill.  Plus, I have total control.  the one instant difference when I use a common eboard is that I can't turn!  I don't know how you guys do it out on the streets but I need a tail and a nose on my shit.  
I've tried hub motors on street decks and it was pretty dope.  The only problem is that the wheels are too damn big.  If anyone knows of hub wheel motors out there smaller than 75 hit me up.![20181104_003714|666x500](upload://mOVzK1oKYzS2r9sBWnx5Dwc1u0m.jpeg)

I would like to see that or as they say "video or it did not happen".
I used to skate short trick boards a lot back in high school, never was very good at it but I liked it and could land a few tricks and manual for decent distances. I can't see myself ollie that heavy longboard though it does not even have a tail maybe I should build a short deck with hubs too, might be fun.

The problem is if you want something to go up and down curbs and you end up going with Hub Motors you're going to beat the living crap out of your motors.

Hahaha ok maybe not that long.  I've never done any distance test.  But if you skate, you know that when manualing, you can reach a comfort point where the only thing that will stop you is your momentum and speed.  You can get that same comfort point with powered boards.

Yeah the urethane or rubber outer material wore out way too fast.

That is a filthy dirty little bastard of a board right there.  True function over form.  Use it till something falls off....replace bit that fell off.....repeat..    I love it!  
Needs to be in that thread with that old kicker of yours @b264

Haha thanks man!  she's raw and rough.  Many a time have my batteries fallen off sending me through the air but I love building them so I can't have anything too permanent because I will end up taking it apart!
