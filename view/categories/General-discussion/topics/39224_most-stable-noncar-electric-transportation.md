So I was just wondering what is the most stable electric transportation. I know skateboards can get fast electric ones in my opion I think electric bikes are the most stable electric vehicles that is not a car I've always dreamed of making a electric go cart that is street legal but that seems impossible, to low to the ground and just to many obstacles To overcome with the law.anyone want to chime in on there ideas or what they think is the most stable electric vehicle for top speed that is not a car

Electric scooters are pretty good, Xiaomi makes a nice one, not too expensive.

Electric motorbikes are nice too, but it's not the same budget. Plus I think it might be dangerous as it's silent. I like when people hear me coming when I ride my motorcycle.

If you need portable then the scooter is best and also much better for security then a moped/motorcycle. You can also use them as mixed transport- with train or bus

Depends what you need from it,ie portability,range,weight etc,there's plenty to choose from but building your own means you build it to your specific specifications that you want/need.
