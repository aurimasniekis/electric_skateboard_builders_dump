I'm looking for HTD 265-5M Belts in Canada, the only option I have found is from enertion and the price is for 4 belts. Are there any other options out there?

Thanks @Smorto.

1 belt plus cheapest shipping is $28 from V belt supply, but from enertion 4 belts are $30 shipped. Might just go with enertion.

Any experience with those belts? They look a little thin.  Don't nail me if that's how they are since I've never held a belt so I wouldn't know.

Personally I haven't bought from them though I have heard good reviews about them. Belts are relatively thin but I am not sure how to explain it :slight_smile:. Even so, I would say with such a low price there is no reason not to at least try it. Then if it doesn't work we will know for the future. When my belt breaks this is the place I will be buying from.

For reference this is my Enertion belt. Looks about the same. If you order from there please post it here so we can see the quality.

You're right it is 5 bucks for a belt, but shipping is $23 to Canada, so the total is $28 is what I meant.

try aliexpress. I got 5 belts for my CGT for $20 shipped. I also got two belts from V-belt supply(i think 6 bucks shipping and like 7 bucks a belt) and the ones from V-belt supply seem thicker and stronger. Even the aliexpress belts have been pretty good for me.

Where are you in Can ?

Most big cities , you will be able to find locally.

Try contacting "Wajax Industrial Componants" they are all over Canada. Ask them where you can purchase HDT5 Belts.

Just received a quote from Wajax. Its 13.40 CAD per belt, but I ended up going with enertion belts because of the cost per belt and the fast shipping.  

Thank you all for your suggestions!

This belt is listed as 53T.
the enertion one is listed as a 55T Is it ok to use a belt with less teeth? Because i dono it just seems like something wouldn't mesh right if there are less teeth. Also not listed as HTD what does that mean? I don't want to have to buy belts all the way from Australia every time one breaks. But in my searching i am trying to find out what all the different things mean, so i can make an informed purchase.

Less teeth would just mean the distance between your wheel and motor will be smaller. If you have an adjustable motor mount it could probably accommodate the 2 tooth difference

Check vbeltsuply.com, they have everything. Also HTD 5m is the standard used to manufacture the belt, they need to be HTD 5m or they probably won't mesh correctly.

It's the same story on that website too. It's also listed as a 53t. So that goes back to my original question will a 53t work on a 15t/36t pulley set with no issues?

If you have a center to center adjustable mount then yes. 2 teeth shouldn't make a huge difference tho.

In General, if you find a part price that you like and the shipping cost makes it unaffordable, then contact the company and ask them to reprice using China post instead of the courier price that appears on their web site.  The $30 to $40 shipping cost should drop to under $7.00 

The same can be done for US Suppliers, except you ask them to ship via US postal service instead of courier.

For example, I found a great place to buy gear belts from China for a size that was hard to find else where:


http://www.3vbelt.com/cart/

They have a great search tool.  So if you type in HTD 255-5M or  HTD 290-5M it will tell you how many teeth and give you all the available thicknesses.  

I used the search tool to find the right size to give me seven extra teeth compared to the 255mm belt that came with my motor mount kit.  You can tell how many teeth you need if you line the teeth up with distance you want the motor bolts to move back in the slot.  Then double the number.  I counted 4 teeth...

![image|690x387](upload://uIrSsM1mWYGhVIJL7UDIN4KkPcY.jpg)

My 255 mm belt postioned my motor bolts at the right most position in the slot.  I wanted to move to the left most positon in the slot.  Thats 4 teeth plus a wee bit.  But the 4 teeth needs to be doubled becasue you need 4 teeth on the botom of the loop and 4 teeth on the top. 

So double is eight but I decided on 7 extra teeth to be conservative. I did not want to end up with a belt that was just one tooth too long to be properly tensioned.

So when I search for my original belt and longer belts, I can confirm that I get 7 extra teeth:
![image|382x200](upload://aUonclxFR3IYxUdHSqWhnRbIHO.png)

![image|375x153](upload://52fxMIL9XHI7Vt6NCLxKSxwmTYa.png)

58 teeth - 51 teeth = 7 so I'm happy.

The belts are around $2.00 each.  The web site calculates courier shipping at $40 but if you send an email to the rep on the contact page and ask her to reprice it at china post rates, the shipping is $7.00 to the US.

If you can get your exact size on DIY electric there won't be much difference in price and the package will arrive faster.  But if you need a specific length 3vbelt can save a lot of searching and a lot of money.

I needed 290mm length which was not widely available.

www.3vbelt.com does not have the 12mm belt thickness that was originally with the kit.  The closest sizes are10mm and 15mm.  So I just purchased two 10mm and two 15mm instead.  I think either thickness would work but I'm going to try the 15mm belts first and spin them against some emery cloth to take off one or 2 mm.

I hope these tips work out for others.

Your right.  Low prices and availability of 12mm.  Worth while if they can ship china post instead of  charging $35 for courier.  I already ordered elsewhere so I can't test that out.  But defintely worth a try by others.

If someone else buy's here and suceeds in getting China post shipping, please post.

To anyone interested in buying belts for cheap. I found HTD5M belt 265-5M-12 on AliExpress for a lot of 10 at $32USD. I ordered mine last week. I'll give a review after I've had some time to test them. You can choose $2 ePacket for express shipping. https://www.aliexpress.com/item/10-pieces-HTD5M-belt-265-5M-12-Teeth-53-Length-265mm-Width-15mm-timing-belt-rubber/32793390547.html?spm=2114.search0104.3.1.eb4d26c5sYCR5I&ws_ab_test=searchweb0_0,searchweb201602_1_10152_10151_10065_10344_10130_10068_10324_10547_10342_10325_10546_10343_10340_10548_10341_10545_10696_10084_10083_10618_10307_10059_308_100031_10103_10624_10623_10622_10621_10620,searchweb201603_25,ppcSwitch_5&algo_expid=a5ed517c-1eab-4a94-842c-02dc7ff84bed-0&algo_pvid=a5ed517c-1eab-4a94-842c-02dc7ff84bed&priceBeautifyAB=0

Yes, they appeared to be of good quality. However, I didn't have a chance to test ride them since they ended up not fitting my build. They were too short my needs. I ended up selling to someone else on this forum.
