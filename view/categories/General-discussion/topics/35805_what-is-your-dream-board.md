If you could build any board(s) that you want. What would it be? I'm talking unlimited resources, full access to industrial grade CNC machines, etc. I'll start it off with mine:

1st Build: Commuter/All Round
Deck - Custom made carbon fiber 34" with integrated enclosure. 
ESC: Ollins esc 2.0 (Based off of 6.0)
Motor(s) - Dual Carvon v4 w/90mm Flywheels 75a.
Battery - 10 or 12s3p 26650

I chose direct drive for my commuter purely because if I'm using this one to go to work I can't have a belt break on me. It has to be as reliable as possible. 

2nd Build: Speed Freak
TBD 

3rd Build: eMTB
TBD

Vanguard or dervish style board with a drop in full bamboo, with ronin precisions and somehow weigh the same as an analog board... 

What I would give for a double drop dervish in full bamboo.....words cannot explain.

something that could get me up any hill and go 30+ km/h and travel 25+ km. also beefy wheels like 100mm or more for Ireland's horrible footpaths. Aesthetics are also a big thing. I would like a very slim sleek design fully black board and blue wheels. I don't know how I would achieve this but I am sure it couldn't be too hard

You would get a battery from @longhairedboy? I mean, his products are awesome, but you have unlimited access to high quality spot welders. I would make my own pack, it really isn't that hard if you have the right tools.

I wouldn't limit yourself for air transportation. You could always build a battery pack that separate into sections. You could engineer something to make it really easy to come in and out. Then you just pop the batteries out when you fly.

this guy ships tonight. Probably the dreamiest thing i've built yet. 

but my dream board is probably Biff's kid's bulldog hoverboard from back to the future 2. IT had fucking jet engines on it, not to mention the antigrav pads like most hoverboards.

Niether, 4 wheels. 2 motors per wheel, one mounted under the deck, and one mounted backwards, similar to trampa motor mounts. One belt for both motors, with 2 belt tensioners per motor, one on top, one on bottom to keep it from slipping. Do that times 4 wheels, and there's the 8 motors.
