I'm in the market for a full face helmet. I cant decide on which one I want. Suggestions? Recommendations?

Full face helmets are awesome!  Good choice.  You can mount a camera so easily, and can also block the wind when going at faster speeds...or use a tint visor in bright days.  

If you can afford it, go with the TSG pass, it's highly regarded in the downhill community.  I personally use a predator DH6 (i'm sure you've seen videos of that on floating around on this forum). The motorcycle helmets are heavier than they need to be.  The downhill longboarding specific full face helmets are lighter and breath better since you're not going at motorcycle speeds.

To add on to what @Photorph said, try the helmet out first if you can. I ordered the Bell Super 2r in large (largest available) but it didn't fit at all. So do your own due diligence!

Skate full helmets are light weight and have better visibility.

I've had my eye on the Bell Sanction helmet, mostly due to how light and inexpensive it is. Normally, about $65 on Amazon. Unfortunately, I don't have $250+ to spend on a helmet, but those TSG's are pretty nice. Demon and THE have some good looking open face helmet options for under $100 on Amazon too.

@Randyc1 I did, and I'm right at about 57cm. Sounds like they run true to size, so I got the medium which fits 55-58cm. I'll find out how it fits tomorrow when it gets delivered and let you know.

What speeds are you doing gents that made the full face appeal to you? Or is it the looks?

I prefer being inconspicuous (which is already hard on a CF board). Do you cop any unwanted attention with the full face on? 

Does it dull the experience, because you are less connected/ less sensory? 

I can only do around 42kmph peak (usually around 35kmph), and haven't felt the desire for full face, but then again I haven't had that maiden stack that might change my mind.

I have a full face cuz...

1) I'm over 50 km/h on my e-boards and over 65 km/h downhill.  
2) Michigan is cold 
3) you can mount a camera much easier and use a mic inside the helmet to avoid wind noise and get clear audio
4) the visor helps with wind at high speed and with the bright sun since its tinted
5) because it matches my LHB board and looks so cool

Edit: 

6) most importantly...because I like my face and would like to keep skin on it, even a fall at slow speeds can mess your face up if you land wrong.

So, I think she's a keeper. 2 days shipped from Amazon. Just a hair over 2 lbs. (910g.)! It's so light. And so far, it's snug, but quite comfortable. And the best part, my wife actually thinks it looks cool! Even she seemed surprised that she liked it. Usually, I would just get a sigh and some rolled eyes whenever she saw me in my old bike helmet. Lol.

Honestly anything above 20mph. I know people say its not necessary, but when you're using it in the city the variables adds up, too many factors like cars, pot holes, pedestrians, bike etc. When you add the frequencies of using the e-board, which is almost everyday, the risk increases exponentially. Any one of those can cause a major accident that leaves you with a broken jaw or worst. 

Another reason is because I've fell several times before and I got hurt really bad even when I rode on the Yuneec Ego with its low top speed. Final reason, when I was practicing as a Occupational Therapist, I saw many people with broken body parts and crushed jaws when i worked at a rehab clinic, that shit aint no joke. It might be a bit cumbersome and you look kinda pretentious, but I'd rather look silly than to lose my precious jaw, I need them to enjoy the delicacies of mediterranean food.

You guys think a full face helmet is necessary for going below 40km|25mp/h? I was thinking something like this: https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B00RB99FIG/ref=ox_sc_act_title_1?smid=A6Y1WPQZL2U61&psc=1

25mph is pretty damn fast. 

I generally ride 10-14mph and top out around 18mph if I'm on a nice clear flat path. The same speeds I go pushing. I wear a Triple 8 Brainsaver, but any faster and I'd go Full Face. It's a lot easier to run out or maneuver out of a fall at 15 than 25. Think about it this way. How fast can you run?

25 mph on a skateboard is very fast.  I use a bicycle helmet when I'm planning on going slow or just cruising under 18 mph.  But really you can fall on your face at even slow speeds.

I think most people get serious about safety gear after they have a fall.

True, oftentimes it takes a fall to get people to gear up.

Some of my worst skate injuries have happened when I've been practically doing nothing. I trashed my wrist board sliding a parking block and added insult to injury just doing an ollie in place. After that, I never skated again without wrist guards. I used to be on and off with wearing a helmet until I had a hard fall and hit my head. Fortunately I was wearing my helmet that day. Now I always wear one when I go out skating.  

@quanze, There are collapsible helmets out there. My friend who bikes has a Carrera helmet that collapses down. I've seen a few others out there that look promising.

@Randyc1 Most definitely, but honestly, I haven't been able to use it much lately what with life getting in the way and all. I still think it fits really well and it feels like it's perfectly sized for my head. An added bonus is that my snowboard goggles fit the helmet very nicely.
