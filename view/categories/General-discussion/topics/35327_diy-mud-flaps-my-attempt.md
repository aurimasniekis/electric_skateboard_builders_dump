My first post here, saw another post about mud flaps, and saw a DIY on instructables...i think.. at any rate just a coule quick pics as im in the midst of recording the process but what do you think? I wanted something that didnt cover the front and back of deck but something that looked a bit more like it was meant to be there and rolled up from the bottom...

light mock up not pinned all the way down yet...

If you have access to a 3D printer you can print these. 
[Electric Skateboard Wheel Guard / Mud Guard](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2432745)

I designed these to be as clean as possible. Becuase I printed them the same colour as the wheels you hardly notice them. I only run them on the front wheels, I don't seem to get dirty from the rear wheels.

This is just fantastic! I never thought about mounting guards this way. Looks very clean, doesn't weight anything and removable. Wow.

Those mud flaps are great. I live in SF, so not that much rain, but awesome none the less.

Looks like these would also prevent wheel bite? I don't know how useful that would be.

They will kinda stop wheel bite. It's only 3d printed so I suspect if your carving that hard to get bite you will prob crush the plastic between the board/foot and wheel. Always a good idea to print in abs or stronger plastic.

83mm abecs would still fit. The clearance would suit up to prob 86mm wheels.
