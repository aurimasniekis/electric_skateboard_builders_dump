Last september I was pulled over by an NYPD cop while riding in the bike lane. charged $138 plus 2 points on my license for "improper signal"

![unnamed-15|378x500](upload://AjvqmRK9vhctdf55PnrQUSELqtG.jpg)
(disclaimer i no longer own a boosted board but it is how i got into eboarding) 

obviously I disputed the ticket and my court hearing is tomorrow 

the cop said that because an electric skateboard has motors I cant ride in the bike lane and because you cant register the board, you cant ride on the street either

I get that electric skateboards aren't technically legal (or illegal?), but my argument tomorrow in court is going to be that its not fair to give someone points on their license for operating something that doesn't require a license to begin with 

has anyone else disputed an eboard ticket in court before? any lawyers out there? looking for ideas 

the cop wasnt wrong about me changing lanes without using my blinker (lol), but it was only to avoid this crap in the bike lane:

![unnamed-12|378x500](upload://fXQiFOjyYkFpwMoYsZLPFnQEEuD.jpg)

it happened in the upper east side on 72nd/1st in case anyone was wondering:

I'm tempted to ride my electric board to court tomorrow....

Wow, the one hundred or so youtube videos, especially Tishawn and the hundreds of esk8ers in the area, then this special transit cop gives you a ticket!?!?! That is some bs!

 I haven't really heard of anyone in NYC having this issue, and they ride, EVERYWHERE!  I mean, bike lanes, streets, Central Park, everywhere.  Even when confronted by cops, it was in areas where they had high pedestrian traffic.  That only lead to them being asked to leave that area with their boards.  

I wish I had some advise, but please let us know how all this goes.

That's not true. There are area's the NYCEC adivse not to ride since stuff like this happens. Im pretty sure either the Upper East Side or the Highway around there is very advise against. And cops do due ESK8/Electric Vehicle Sweeps wave every now and then. Just not very often

There's a reason the majority of the pre made electric skateboards sold in America are capped out at 23 (22 in some states) miles per hour. Anything more and it technically becomes a motorized vehicle by the definition of law.

I would bring in a manufacturer's spec sheet to prove that your bored is underpowered to be considered a motorized vehicle.  do some reading about moped laws in your state because those are the laws we tend to fall under. Look up what defines a motorized vehicle in your state.

From a reddit post : 

> I dug up this post from u/snovajivu
> 
> from a year ago (that redditor hasn't been heard from since, so I hope he wasn't hurt riding or arrested and sent to Gitmo):
> 
> I'm a NY rider, and also a practicing attorney. To clarify, because there's been a ton of very sloppy media reporting about this, and the NYPD has given out confusing information in the past too:
> 
>     There is no "recent hoverboard law." Zero laws or regulations have been passed in response to hoverboards in NY. All this talk of a ban began a few months ago when the NYPD sent out a tweet citing an existing regulation that appeared to ban motorized scooters. The media jumped onto the "NYPD is banning hoverboards” and/or the "hoverboards are now illegal" bandwagon. The reality was, there was no NYPD action to ban hoverboards and there was no new law. The NYPD’s intent was simply to remind people that pursuant to an existing law, hoverboards are illegal.
>     Then, people pointed out this regulation didn't actually apply to hoverboards, because they don't have handlebars, and the regulation cited by the NYPD appeared to exempt devices without handlebars. Then everyone jumped on the "haha, the NYPD was wrong, hoverboards aren't actually illegal" bandwagon.
>     Unfortunately, this was also erroneous. The NYPD eventually corrected their mistake and cited to the correct, long-existing sections of NY State Law. The gist of the law is this: anything that gets you from point A to point B on something other than human power is considered a “motor vehicle.” Anything that is a “motor vehicle,” in order to be legal to operate on roads/bike routes/etc, must either be registered with the DMV OR specifically exempted (such as personal mobility devices for disabled people). EVERY other “motor vehicle” is illegal to operate in NYC. Think of the law as a blanket ban with exemptions - motor vehicles are illegal unless registered or otherwise exempt. Then contrast this to the other potential approach - things are legal unless specifically banned. The problem is that the media (and therefore the public) talked about the traffic laws as if they were the latter: if there’s no specific ban targeting hoverboards/boosted boards/etc, they must be legal. But this isn’t how the law works.
> 
> The bottom line is therefore: both boosted boards and hoverboards are illegal to operate in NYC and always have been since they appeared on the market. The law makes absolutely no distinction between them (or between e-bikes for that matter): they are all motor vehicles that can’t be registered with the DMV and aren’t otherwise exempt from the general ban. This has ALWAYS been the case for so long as the traffic law has been what it is. There’s actually not much confusing about the law; it’s pretty straightforward. The fact that they don’t ticket people is because the NYPD doesn’t enforce these laws for the most part. However, they have every right to enforce them at their discretion at any time they want. Just look at the example of e-bikes: everyone knows they are illegal, the NYPD periodically cracks down, but outside of those crackdowns, you see delivery guys ride e-bikes all the time with impunity. Boosted boards are technically treated the exact same as e-bikes under New York State Law, it's just that there has never been a boosted board crackdown.
> The existing law is not "inaccurate" - that seems like a poor/confusing choice of words by those holding the press conference. The law is what it is, I think what he means to say (which seems supported by context) is that the law MAKES hoverboards illegal, but that hoverboards SHOULD BE legal because they don’t present any significant danger to the road beyond those posed by skateboards, etc. But that's a different argument than saying the existing laws permit hoverboards and/or that they are confusing in their treatment of hoverboards. Neither is true.

```
ill have to do some research but im pretty sure they actually are technically not allowed. my goal is not to argue that they are allowed as i think id lose, but to argue that i shouldnt be given points on my license 

for instance: anyone of any age can buy a boosted board in nyc. and if someone without a license bought one and got pulled over like i did then they would have gotten less of a punishment because they dont have a drivers license 

so basically what that cop is saying is if you are legally allowed to drive, then your punishment for riding an electric skateboard in nyc will be more severe. i feel like theres got to be some sort of legal term for how thats not fair....

I'd argue against the entire ticket. 
That the law clearly defines all vehicles but electric skateboards and the closest classification is it is legal consider it can be assisted just like a pedal assist bicycle.... Kind of...haha but I would still not plead guilty because the law does not specifically call out 4 wheeled assisted powered personal transportation device.
If there is any nothing classifying the board as a vehicle or not then how can you break a law that does not Exist.....???

In that case, the definition you are looking for is vehicle:

New York Consolidated Laws, Vehicle and Traffic Law - **VAT § 159. Vehicle**

**Every device in, upon, or by which any person or property is or may be transported or drawn upon a highway, except devices moved by human power or used exclusively upon stationary rails or tracks.**

**S 1163.** Turning movements and required signals. (a) No person shall
turn a vehicle at an intersection unless the vehicle is in proper
position upon the roadway as required in section eleven hundred sixty,
or turn a vehicle to enter a private road or driveway, or otherwise turn
a vehicle from a direct course or move right or left upon a roadway
unless and until such movement can be made with reasonable safety. **No**
**person shall so turn any vehicle without giving an appropriate signal in**
**the manner hereinafter provided.**
  (b) A signal of intention to turn right or left when required shall be
given continuously during not less than the last one hundred feet
traveled by the vehicle before turning.
  (c) No person shall stop or suddenly decrease the speed of a vehicle
without first giving an appropriate signal in the manner provided herein
to the driver of any vehicle immediately to the rear when there is
opportunity to give such signal.
  (d) The signals provided for in section eleven hundred sixty-four
shall be used to indicate an intention to turn, change lanes, or start
from a parked position and not be flashed on one side only on a parked
or disabled vehicle, or flashed as a courtesy or "do pass" signal to
operators of other vehicles approaching from the rear.
  (e) The driver of a vehicle equipped with simultaneously flashing
signals as provided for in subdivision eighteen-a of section three
hundred seventy-five shall use such signals when the vehicle is stopped
or disabled on a public highway, except when such vehicle is stopped in
compliance with a traffic-control device or when legally parked. The
driver of a vehicle so equipped may use such signals whenever necessary
to warn the operators of following vehicles of the presence of a traffic
hazard ahead of the signaling vehicle, or to warn the operators of other
vehicles that the signaling vehicle may itself constitute a traffic
hazard, taking into account traffic and highway conditions. No person
shall use such signals for any other purpose.

S 1164. Signals by hand and arm or signal lamps. (a) **Any stop or turn**
**signal when required herein shall be given either by means of the hand**
**and arm or by signal lamps**, except as otherwise provided in subsection
(b).

Good luck man, let us know how it goes. I live right next to a police station (not in NY) and never have any trouble. I ride on sidewalks (slow, especially around pedestrians), in the road, anywhere really, and never have this kind of trouble. I get waves and smiles mostly... The police around here seem to be understanding or just not care. I hope the judge sees your riding in a similar light.

This is what I am going to say and I'll let you all know what happens: 

The laws for electric skateboards are somewhat undefined and vague in NYC - on April 3rd Mayor De Blasio recently made pedal assist electric bikes legal, while two-wheeled hoverboards remain illegal. There is no mention of electric skateboards, which probably fall somewhere in between the two 

I ride an electric skateboard for a number of reasons: they are better for the environment, less expensive, and more time efficient than a taxi, uber, or owning your own car. Having said that, I understand that they can be potentially dangerous - which, I imagine, is why the officer gave me a ticket. 

I’m not here to dispute the fine, although I’m not sure I deserve it. I’m here to dispute receiving points on my license. Electric skateboards can be legally purchased in NYC without a license. And if my exact same offence was committed by someone who is not licensed to drive a car, then their punishment would have been much less severe because a person can’t receive points on a non-existent drivers license. 

I would also like to point out that I did in fact leave the bike lane and move into the car lane briefly, and probably without using a hand signal. But I did so in order to avoid road debris from construction, a handicap ramp set up in the middle of the bike lane, and a man who seemed to be mopping the bike lane. It was early on Sunday morning so there was very little traffic and I’m sure I checked to make sure there weren’t any cars coming because I wouldn’t have wanted to get hit by one. I have photos on my phone of all of the obstructions I mentioned. These photos are all time stamped and location stamped on my iphone, and will match the time and location of the ticket

Good luck I'm not sure they'll give you the platform to get all of that out usually when I've been to court they just want to hear your guilty or not guilty plea and then go from there if you go not guilty then there's a chance they'll want to hear you out but I think typically you'll just get another court date to come present your case.  Either way good to have a plan and sounds reasonable to me, hope it works out alright.  Also side note I don't have a license (it's a long story involves a police chase... allegedly) when I was stopped on my board (for jumping on a sidewalk when it started raining) I was worried that was going to be something they'd throw at me, but when they called it in and cop who was talking with me just let it go.

Going against the grain here but:

In order to get your license you did a test that _proves_ you know the road rules where your license is valid.
In a car, motorcycle or even on a push bike you need to indicate when you change lanes on a road way.
You broke the rules, you will lose points because you have already proven (license test) that you should know better.
There is no talking your way out of it based on it isn't fair. Maybe you might be able to argue some kind of financial hardship if losing the points would have a significantly greater impact on you than the average person (and fall on the judges mercy) but I doubt it.

I got yelled at by a cop when I was speeding 30+ in a 25mph zone I came back later down the same road not going as fast and the same cop stopped me but he was cool he was just curious about the board even asked if I could build him one, I pointed him to the this forum let's see if he joins us :)

Pretty ridiculous the Judge would even waste his/her time with this. I would have been like " dont ride in the streets/bike lane anymore "  CASE DISMISSED :grinning:

 SO last night on our Sacramento group ride this may or may not have happened... We ran into a Ranger...she pulled Bart over at like 30mph during a speed run on the bike trail, said "hey those are not allowed!" I rolled up and handed her a printed copy of CALI law AB604, highlighted the important part giving us rights to ride anywhere an ebike is allowed, Bart pulled up a letter on his phone from her boss, the head ranger in sac county. The letter says we were legal and to print out the letter to show to other rangers. lol..she looked at me and said "This smells like weed?" as she smelled the printed copy of 604..so I did what I do best...I smiled and asked "Well does it at least smell like good weed?"...and she goes...sure does...handed it back to me and let us ride on...

i was tempted to but decided against it...maybe in november... 

its not avoiding paying the ticket so much as the principle of getting pulled over on a skateboard...and the points on my license 

plus it was pretty fun to defend myself in court:

if someone without a license bought one and got pulled over like i did then they would have gotten less of a punishment because they dont have a drivers license

I suspect that particular cop would cite them for "driving without a license" in addition to the "no signalling" and anything else he could think up. The punishment/fine might be higher.

There are some jurisdictions where you are not required to signal if you are taking **emergency** action to avoid an imminent road hazard (or at least there were as of about 15 years ago). The problem is that it must be totally unpredictable...like a deer suddenly leaping in front of your vehicle. If it was visible in time for the driver to take controlled evasive action...like trash just sitting in the road...then that presumes the driver also had time to signal.

The metadata associated with images and other recordings on a phone can be edited and/or faked. Might be considered, but not reliable evidence. The information on the ticket is about the only "hard" evidence available to the court.

Sorry to hear that bro. Three times I had police try to stop me on my board. First in NJ, second and third time on the west side highway bike lane. First 2 times I ignored them and kept moving (catch me bitches) third time I stopped cause I was curious as to what they’d say. They told me I have to kick and not use my motor. After expressing my frustration I walked my board across the street ( still in they view) got back on my board and continued on my way. Last time I stop for police. F. The police

the ticket was dismissed - i didnt even have a chance to bring up any of my arguments to the judge. i think she was even a little pissed at the cop for wasting her time 

i was however locked into a higher car insurance rate for six months because of the license points right before the ticket was dismissed

My friend told me this, not sure how well it'd end up working in a case such as this, but claim that you aren't sure if the ticket is real since it is a copy, ask for the original and tell them you will pay the fine if they give you the original (which they most likely will not be able to obtain since cops give you a copy usually. Since they may not be able to get the original, you won't have to pay. And if that doesn't work, the judge typically gets a % of the ticket if you pay, and you can ask them if they do, which if they answer yes, they become biased, which you can get out of paying the fine. This is what my friend told me, not sure how this plays out in court or if it works, but this only gets you out of the fine, not sure about other consequences. If there are any lawyers, maybe you can confirm or deny if this would actually work in court.
