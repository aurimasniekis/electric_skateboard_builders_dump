disclaimer: I'm newbie for sliding. I'm practicing and waiting for my slide build. so not sure if this will work.

so As I start picking up slide, I got an idea maybe eskate can use the puck with remote together. 
please see the pic and tell me what you think![1528933152137|281x500](upload://2LELWbtXf23B24pc7qgdA9TRtep.jpg)

The remote would get smashed and the feel would be missing

This makes more sense
