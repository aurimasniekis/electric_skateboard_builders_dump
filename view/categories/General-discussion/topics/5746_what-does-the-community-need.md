The community is growing at such a rate that most suppliers are constantly on back order. By gathering data on what needs more options or what needs faster production we can help the suppliers. Fill this form out for the sake of the community :slight_smile:

EDIT: Data will be posted after submissions slow down. ALSO! [Build template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13C7KFaKLvVFcnXTr2vUg8kO2lmVqHX5vElVWK7inxNs/edit?usp=sharing)

Do we or do we not have wiiceivers available? Are there any conversions for the GT2B controllers? Are we able to get these special encloseres , whether fiberglass, carbon fiber or plastic. I know some of the people are very intimidated with some of the work they see. But if you don't ask you won't know. üëå I love the work these guys put out. Shooooot..... I wish I had access to some the tools these guys have. But that's the purpose of this site. To connect people and network so we can have the things we only dream of on our rigs. So ask or post on the forum. These guys are wonderful. I know this üéº much, the people in my town are going to be the enve of what me and my wife is going to be sporting. I gaurentte by next year I'll have a üòõ crew of people wanting and or cruising in my neiborghood. So let's get this list going. Let's all rally and figure out whay we need so we can make this community great. 

Keep cruising ‚ù§ yo.

Yea I know was just stating. I'm going with the GT2B or mini controller. I'll start there ‚òù first. But if I do go GT2B I want the conversion kit. I saw some on eBay. Want to see if there was any other styles available.

I just started building my first board. I'm a newb. However a few frustrating things I ran into were:

1. Batteries! Prebuilt/modular 18650 or 26650 packs. It would be nice to have a design similar to lipos so we can configure packs in different configurations without spot welding. Something like this: 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEED8037tKk&t=203s

2. Also the batteries from enertion and DIY are nice but I'm having a hard time finding a battery solution for shorter cruising boards. It would also be nice to have solid DIY pack tutorials. Maybe I missed some in my searching but I can only find clunky packs for ebikes.

3. Enclosures! I like where diyelectricskateboard and runplayback are going but it would be nice to have more options.
Also a good DIY fiberglass tutorial would be nice. 

These are all nice to haves. Overall I'm super impressed with this community. Keep up the good work!

[I now offer Li-Ion batteries](http://nosam.bigcartel.com/product/lithium-ion-batteries) ranging from 6s2p all the way up to 12s5p. You were asking for packs meant for cruisers, 6s2p-4p is great for that.
