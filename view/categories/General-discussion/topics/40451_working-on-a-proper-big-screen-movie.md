Wow what a crazy and great time the last few weeks and months have been thanks to Street Wing.

The latest adventure that has come my way is working on movie!

 I am currently working with a movie special effects company on a film for the big screen. It's all top secret and strictly hush hush so I cant give away too many details other than I am helping them build a vehicle which will have a human occupant.
