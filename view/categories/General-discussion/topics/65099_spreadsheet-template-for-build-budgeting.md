I have created a spreadsheet in Google Sheets to help organize and price out eSk8 builds. I have used this for multiple different build plans. It calculates overall cost automatically, just put in all the information. Make a copy in google drive to edit it!

Please leave any feedback, I would appreciate it. Maybe share what you use to organize too!

Here is an example of how it works with a build I am working on. Feedback on this would be great too, especially the battery!

Looks god. The only thing I would suggest would be to add a total spent - in progress cell to show how much has been spent on parts currently ordered so you could see how much you spent, and how much is left to spend.
