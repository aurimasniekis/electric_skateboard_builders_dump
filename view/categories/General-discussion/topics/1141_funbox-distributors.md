These guys are really helpful and have unbeatable pricing on their decks, decent selection too. 

if you are on a budget and plan on repainting you deck you cannot go wrong. They even have free shipping within the US.

These are quality decks. Those ebay decks are usually crap quality similar to what you would see at walmart.

Funbox is well respected in the longboarding community and sells great gear for the financially handicapped. I think they even do custom graphics now too!

Depends on the seller on ebay, Most are usually local skate shops :smile:  
I do like their free US shipping and California location
