Hi guys, several people asked how to run VESC Tool or Ackamaniac VESC Tool under mac, many suggested to install Windows through Bootcamp, but I thought it's a bit overkill so I went and built both tools for Mac.

https://github.com/aurimasniekis/vesc_tool_official/releases

https://github.com/aurimasniekis/vesc_tool_ackmaniac/releases

The only problem is that if you running latest version Gatekeeper will not allow running unidentified applications. At the moment I don't have Apple Developer license membership so I can't sign these applications to run without problem. But there is a fix:

You will need to open the application called Terminal which is located in:

`/Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app/`

and paste this line of code to disable Gatekeeper (allows to run apps not verified by apple)

```
sudo spctl --master-disable
```
and enter your password and press enter now it should work.

If I am missing latest version just mention me in this topic I will build and release it right away ;)

Nice job !

But I think there is an error in your first phrase (windows instead of mac)...

No difference I guess ;) I just saw people asking, so I went and made it, as I am compiling it for myself already :) I guess there are probable every tool compiled to mac, but just lost in the posts :)

Ahm what kind of error messages? I have tried on multiple macs without a single error on extracting zip file. There was issues with ack build as I haven't included linked QT libs inside application but I fixed it.

Vesc tool is better use the one @Pimousse linked I am bit lazy to go god lengths to relink global libs to internal ones...

You have to enable the ability to download from an unsecured site basically Max‚Äôs really only want to download from the App Store

I think his issue is either zip file is not recognised or he tries to open something wrong. @ArnhemAnt can you make a screenshot what you trying to open?

Sorry for the delay. I've played around with this a little more and have discovered that my OS version is not supported - bugger....

Not that easy. I'm running the 'old' mac tower and I cannot install any of the latest OS versions on my current system and certainly can't afford to upgrade just yet.
I also tried to download the link above from @Pimousse, but it also won't open. Strangely, there are no error messages with that download, but when I go to open the app, nothing happens. I deleted the file and downloaded again and still the same - nothing. 
Frustrating.
Hopefully, the app that @twan is working on will have full functionality soon so that I can just configure the ESC's through his app. 
Until that time, I have no idea how to get around it.

Virtual box is a free virtual system and you can load windows 3.1-win 10, Mac OS X also Linux.

Thanks guys. I understand that there are ways around this, however, I'm pretty sure that I still have to buy Windows and I don't really want to be forking out additional cash, particularly when it is only to run one single application.

...you don‚Äôt need to buy anything extra. It‚Äôs a free software. Install it on your Mac and it‚Äôs simulating the windows invironment. Means you can run windows software on your Mac. For free.

Here a link for download (hope you don‚Äôt mind that it‚Äôs in German üòâ )

You still need a Windows licence.
Install Ubuntu instead and download VESC Tool directly from vesc-project.com.
There is a linux version.

I beg to differ. You don't need a license to download or run windows. After the trial period, it just locks up certain customizations and a watermark which won't affect you.

@Pimousse & @bsancken you are both correct.  You actually do 'legally' need a license after a 65 day trial period to 'legally' continue use, but ti will continue to run just in a limited sense.

Im an MCSE from way back, Microsoft licensing is shit BTW.  Better than Autodesk, but still terrible.

I mean, if it's just a virtualization for making run VESC Tool, the best choice is linux.
Sure you still can use Windows after the trial period.
But what for ?

I do have a virtual machine on Windows 7 with an expired licence. I don't really use it except for specific software only avalaible on this OS.

Open source with Open source.
VESC Tool with Linux.

@ArnhemAnt Take a look here: http://dosdude1.com/software.html That'll let you patch the installer disc (USB) so that you can upgrade to Sierra, High Sierra, Mojave, etc. üëç

Thanks for the link.

As for trying to run Windoze on mac, I give up. I borrowed a Windoze laptop from a buddy so that I can run the ESC program for the initial setup. Once I've done this, I'm just going to use the Android app that @Ackmaniac has developed so that I can change things via bluetooth.

There's a really fast easy way to bypass the untrusted app blocking in OSX: instead of double clicking the app to open, right click the app and choose "open", then you'll be prompted only once (ever!) to accept the risk of running this software.

Thank you!!
(you can also right click and choose open on the app rather than using the Terminal command)
