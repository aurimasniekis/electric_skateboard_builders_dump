Some of my friends encoraged me to build them electric skateboards, so I placed an order for some parts. I'm also going to build a Trampa Street Carver for me.

Today I got the first batch of parts:

Beautiful Metroboard aluminum 36T pulleys for ABEC flywheels

Some MBS knobby wheels, they did come with bearings

Belts from vbeltsupply:

A beautiful Sector 9 Bintang 38", pretty similar than the Evolve Bamboo GT

A few pulley kits with hardware from @Titoxd10001

Some 5.5mm Bullet connectors:

Calibers II fifty and Gullwing Sidewinders II

The best bearings you can buy for electric skateboards are also the cheapest

Adhesive neoprene tape for electronics to avoid vibrations
[img]http://i.imgur.com/KrR0qdQ.jpg[/img]

18T motor pulleys, they are huge!. I needed more speed on my 10S4P with dual 170KV build, 15/40T got me only 37km/hr
[img]http://i.imgur.com/7u9kybH.jpg[/img]

A couple of VESC, antispark switches and motor 63xx mounts from @torqueboards
[img]http://i.imgur.com/l3XlYfW.jpg?1[/img]
[img]http://i.imgur.com/DZL5WNV.jpg[/img]

210 Samsung 30Q cells from IMRbatteries
[img]http://i.imgur.com/t3FyAPY.jpg[/img]

And finally my long awaited 14 ply Trampa Urban Carver, even though I'll use it as street carver:

[img]http://i.imgur.com/OJGvMEY.jpg[/img]

Vertigo mini trucks
[img]http://i.imgur.com/Xl0wQNA.jpg[/img]

Innova wheels:
[img]http://i.imgur.com/98Nziia.jpg[/img]

Red springs on yellow dampas:
[img]http://i.imgur.com/PzlXg1k.jpg[/img]

Unfortunately there was a mistake, it seems to be on @Trampa side, as I didn't get the 9.525mm bearings for the trampa vertigo trucks, hope it doesn't slow down my build.

Sorry for the misleading title but I do have a boner

Holy cow, that's like a down payment on a house right there. Those aluminum 36T pulleys are absolutely beautiful.

What's the width of those pulleys? 15mm?

```
The Metroboard pulleys for ABEC 11 is beautiful. Is that not similar to Evolve meaning that I would have to dremel a section of the Caliber II hanger off to attach that pulley on?.

I watched a YouTube video of it being taken out and put back in the wheel, it appears to only use two bearings, one in the wheel and one in the pulley instead of the usual 2 bearings in the wheel and a third bearing into the pulley, which is why I'm wondering if the width is still ok on standard Caliber II axle or not? 

If yes then I would have to assume that the inner part of the pulley will act as a spacer for the outer bearing.

I think some playful titles like this should be fine.  People are *far too sensitive* - and this is a skate forum (just electric).  I'm sure any younger members are likely saying a lot worse than boner...

ok i have to ask. I've never heard of zealous bearings so how do they compare to Bones Reds?
```

---
## \#18 Posted by: jmasta Posted at: 2017-05-17T19:59:18.630Z Reads: 468

```
Bearing-wise they are just as good, or better, than Bones Reds

But they have an built-in precision spacer on them. The inside of the bearing has half of a spacer on the inner race. The outside has the "speedrings" machined in. So no washers or spacers required

See Abec11's Builtin Bearings for the origin of the idea
```

bones reds racers with built in spacers do the same thing. Are Zealous just less expensive but have the same kind of quality? if so, i might consider switching.

---
## \#21 Posted by: jmasta Posted at: 2017-05-17T20:20:45.196Z Reads: 439

```
The only problem with bearings with built-in spacers is you cannot adjust the overall spacer length.  

Bones Race Reds have a .200 spacer, so .400" overall. This is actually too short for many wheels.  0.405" is the sweet spot for Abec11, but clones can be anywhere from 0.400 to 0.410"

Zealous are listed as .4045". They have dual shields, unlike the Bones

Well I got them 10 months ago and they work exactly as day one, if not better, the nano ceramic grease seems to stay inside the bearings, the cool thing about them is that you don't need bearing spacers, they are built-in. From my own experience I can say are better than bone reds at least duration wise

Understood - and if there were *actual porn* in the thread i'd suggest you moderate and remove it.

A catchy/fun title or description however isn't needed to search - since your keyword searches search the *contents* of the thread - not just the title.  **So it has zero impact to searching for relevant info within a thread, and more to do with a conservative puritanical concern with the word "boner"?**

And back on topic - As for bearings - i've used Zealous and they are pretty nice.  I prefer the more $$ tektons, and their $$$ ceramics even more...  Bearings it's really about periodic cleaning and re-lube though.

I never lubed any Zealous bearings, they hold a lot of abuse way more abuse than the bones red.

And yeah, sorry for the title, hope I didn't offend anyone with the "word"

I was impressed by the Zealous bearings - and a quick search has them around $16-20 set - super reasonable.  I love the tektons but at $70 for their ceramics - they are $$$.

I might grab another set of Zealous, plus try a set of the Zealous ceramics.

Periodically i clean my bearings (really when i feel they get gritty - or sound funny - or were in the wet).  I got a cheap-o harbor freight ultrasonic - some aluminum safe degreaser, and then re-lube and they are good for quite a while more!  Only takes a few minutes and really helps any bearings!

as for boner - i think you should leave it.  It's funny and if i keyword search for "Zealous bearings" - guess what i find?!?  *this thread*:
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/3/5/35ef24dd97bcef017dbe05e18c348506716aaeef.JPG" width="690" height="443">

So there is **Zero** reason to censor a thread because of a silly/fun title alone.  Again - this is a skateboarding forum - with mostly adults and *sometimes off-color* humor.  Thicken up the skin a bit and move on.  If you start censoring threads because *you* don't like a word/phrase/belief - you'll lose our respect and contribution.

If you had a pic of your boner i think we'd have flagged it already....
