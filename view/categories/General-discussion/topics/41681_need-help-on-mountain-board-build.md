Uhhh If you want an off-road monster ask @psychotiller to build you one 
This is my opinion though

Look the kit comes with two mounts and two motors of your choice (and also 2x vesc 6). I'm not quite sure you understand that, otherwise i don't understand why you would buy a whole kit and then switch to other hardware.
Anyways speed calculation can be found on the trampa website or by using a calculator lake calc.esk8.today.

I think the batteries are ok if you are fine with the capacity, but the 190kv 6374 motor might a bit high kv depending on your gearing.
