**Background:**
In the past few weeks, the moderators have noted about 3x the normal amount of flags seen on this forum. As a general rule, it is known that we use flags to alert forum members and moderators about inappropriate or off-topic posts on the forum. As the amount of members increases, it's natural that the amount of flags would increase as well. However, what we've seen lately is not a result of population growth - it's a result of ego and ignorance, in the form of "flag wars". These flag wars have occurred in multiple topics, usually between a select number of individuals where one or two posts will be flag-worthy, and individuals will then flag each other's posts randomly in a course of revenge. 

**Here's what needs to happen:**
Obviously, as a community, we'd like to avoid incidents like these. I would encourage all members of to continue to make an effort to be open-minded and reasonable when communicating with fellow skaters. Please also keep in mind that when wars occur, it reverberates to **all** members. By avoiding events such as these, **you** can help keep the forum a predominately positive place. 

**As a reminder, here are the correct situations to flag a post:**
Off-Topic
Inappropriate
Spam
Something else (That actively hinders progress of a thread or subject in the community!)


Thanks, and have a great day.

Will you enact any kind of punishment for those abusing the flags?  Like a temporary ban or something like that?

I think that is a good idea as well, along with raising the flag limit to hide a post. It should be at least two..

The answer is yes, and severity of the punishment is decided on a case-to-case basis between the staff.

I think it would be a good idea to pin this topic for a few days.

No offence but you didn't really say "How to use/not use flags on the forum".

In that case I flagged a few of his posts because he was way off topic on the diebie bms. He just couldn't let it go. (Hopefully the was an appropriate use of flags!!!)

I don't have anything againts him but has never build a board but is always talking about such crazy builds. Reason I discourage type of things for people who are not allready veterans our best rider who you would have never thought would get injured died on crazy board builds and for a member who has yet to even build a board try to compare or go even faster with a crazier build I am no go

Let's not turn this into pointing fingers. Take the OP for what it is and move on.

Edit: for those not familiar with OP = original/originating post ie first post of a topic/thread :)

Thank you so much for this...I'm getting mighty sick of all the flagging...just because you don't agree with every response on here doesn't mean it doesn't add to the conversation
