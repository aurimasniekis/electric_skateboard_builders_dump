So today I was going for my first ride in public park. I went past a guy on a normal skateboard, said hi as I went by, and I think I heard 'what board is that?!' as I flew past, but by the time I could respond I was too far away! Awwwwww yeeeeeahhh

Seems like a good idea for a thread!

What humorous/interesting encounters have you had while riding?

I always get looks from people. A few people have also asked me where to get one.

I had a lot of people screaming out random stuff to me when I'm riding, but most of the time I'm going so fast I don't even hear it.  One guy followed me and said "dude I've seen you going soooo fast on that thing, is that a motor or something on there?".  I had a group of punk teenagers driving in front of me slow and giving me the middle finger for no reason, just cuz they thought it's funny.  

Besides that I get a lot of looks.  If I'm using my gopro on my helmet, a lot of ppl wave knowing they are on camera.  Some people take photos of me when I'm riding next to them in their cars.  Fun times.

I've had lots of positive encounters and no negative reactions so far. 

Teenagers in general seem to love the idea, the only guys a bit skeptical seem to be die hard skaters. 
Could have sold my board several times, some people wanted to try and ride it (some could) and I've even had some ladies that wanted to be on a picture with me and the board ... 
Also car drivers have given me a thumbs up and smiles. 

No encounters with the police so far, let's have fingers crossed.

Same here, I don't understand why they just hate the idea of a eBoard. My theory is that they look at themselves like the coolest thing ever and feel that this is a threatening their territory. On the other hand every longboard rider just love the idea of eBoards. 

Beside skater or the occasionally j*&k driver everybody just love the board, my encounters with the police have been to ask where can they get one :-).

Phrases that immediatly kill the conversation: "you should patent that, shark tank blah blah...!
"How do you make it turn?" 
"Thats stupid, those batteries are going to blow up on you and......"

Everyone else loves the future.

Yes, some people think you must be a genius in order to ride a DYI board. 

Had two interesting encounters yesterday: 
One cyclist said: "oh, I saw your electric skateboard in the internet yesterday, now you have one already, wow." (I'm riding a DYI build ;-) )

Was cruising along a pretty crowded path with @michichopf, I was leading in a slow and easy pace. 
He was barely able to follow me because people jumped in his path to see what had just passed them.

"How do you make it turn?" happens WAY more often than I expected. And "do you sell them?" which I just sort of laugh at. No bad interactions so far, just a lot of questions and compliments. Oh, and "you should be wearing a helmet" from my family, mostly my mother.

the builders working near my house shout out at me that i'm lazy & cheating, whenever they see me leave home...  so i just smile back...

and then most everyone else yells how cool it is and how'd you do that.... which is nice.

and then the few boarders i've seen whilst commuting - they just give me the thumbs up.

I have had everyone from hardcore Harley riders to mothers with small children and small children themselves stop me and ask me about the boards.  Of course my boards are conspicuously nonstandard so they stand out.

Every single interaction I've had has been positive.  I even had the park rangers pull up next to me in a lot one time and just smile and drive on... 

But I'm also super-careful to go slowly past people and I crawl past kids on the trails.

yesterday i had someone follow me home in his car (I didnt realize he was following me), and when i got to my porch i was just checking over my bolts and belt and whatnot when he got out and asked where i bought my board. he then asked if i could build him one when, but im moving back to school in a couple of days haha. he was an older Venezuelan gentleman who is a geologist...haha.  this happened at around 7:45 pm in a little canadian suburb.

I had another older couple walking around the neighbourhood at around midnight stop me and ask all about it and how i made it. they were so happy to see something so different :slight_smile:

and then there's the occasional "FUCK YEAH!" as im bombing a hill past some people :stuck_out_tongue:

overall good responses from the public...except that one guy that honked at me one time.:rage:

Finnish people are really reserved and shy so they just stare when I have gone past them. But mostly I get comments from tourists asking me is it electric and how do you control it or how do you steer it (DUH) :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:. Dogs want to play with my board and reindeers just stare at it :eyes:

I get asked all the time about my boards.  Marbel and DIY.  I let folks ride my Marbel (in mode 1 "starter") when they're cool.  Swapped boards w/ another esk8 guy on Alki last week who had a gen 1 evolve:
[img]http://australiaresorts.us/photo/evolve-skateboards-australia-3.jpg[/img]

Surprisingly nice little board - but H E A V Y !  

When i ride by other skateboarders (long and short) sometimes we stop and talk, or they'll stop if i'm waiting for GF to catch up and ask questions.  Usually - what is it, where did you get it, and how much?  I've told multiple folks to look up esk8 builders and ES to learn how to build their own.

All friendly and i'll be the first to say - just a lazy IT guy who likes to skate!  Never an issue, but i'm also a friendly guy and never had any attitude from other skaters so far.  

@CSN - i'd also like to encourage the flashing of esk8 riders.  Just might lead to a few more crashes...

It's funny...I've had pro skaters ride my board and say truly positive things....

It's the casual skaters that say shit lol

I really don't think it's the fact that hate it...it's just they need to put up a "front" that they are hard core purist sk8rs ... Jealousy? A little...or a lot.... But I guaranty if you called them out on the spot put them on an Esk8 right there and then.... I bet they would totally change their tune 😉  One day I'll be lucky to video tape such encounter

I get the cheater one a lot, usually from people on bikes obviously trying to lose weight. 

I get the shark tank and patent and kickstarter and indiegogo stuff a lot too. When i finally tell them that you can't really patent something comprised of a combination of open source and patented parts, they sort of wander off into something they did or made or are thinking about doing. That's usually when i start flipping my board back on and checking my chin strap. 

I got whistled at last weekend, that was refreshing. 

If somebody shouts "where did you get that" I make a point to brake, hit reverse, and ride back to them to have a chat. 99 times out of a 100 it doesn't result in a sales lead but i still enjoy spreading the esk8 love. 

But mostly what i get are respect nods. Usually from the more serious cyclists on $7000 ikes wearing $900 outfits. I guess they see me out there in my motorcycle helmet and pads and they know i'm not fucking around, so i get a lot of smile-nods, up-nods, and even some hang loose hand gestures. Because they're not fucking around either and they respect people who aren't fucking around. 

dogs though.. dogs hate these things. dogs will drag thier walkers to give chase. And it makes the suicide squirrels even more suicidal.

Skaters say shit, but I think it's more of just talking shit than anything. Usually it's at the top of the hill they just skated up. Otherwise they're just interested in trying it out. 

I'm sure there's a bit of jealousy too! Heck, I'd be jealous too! Except for that one longboarder last week that blew past me down the bridge. We got to the top around the same time, but my board was having issues that morning and I had to take my EGO. I've blown past him before, so I'm sure he felt triumphant.

We're not cheating. We are WINNING... at life. It says so right there on my remote control. :smirk:

First question is usually "how fast does that thing go?" and comments about how cool that is or just the incredulous stare. All good interactions so far. But yeah, to dogs, these things are like dog whistles covered in gravy and squirrel meat. They go NUTS. I usually try to slow down and coast by, more for the sake of the owner's and their precious rotator cuffs. 

I did blow a guys mind when he saw me magically cruising up a hill. He had lots of questions. 

I did get stung by a yellow jacket that got sucked into my shirt, but he was an asshole anyway.

i once towed a 250lb man up a hill by his hand on his lovely wooden-surfboard style cruiser longboard. THAT got some attention. We weren't exactly crawling, either. That happened while i was out street testing @Photorph 's first build.  

All he could do was giggle uncontrollably and his wife was clapping from her bicycle.

The cop actually took a picture of the logo on my board to look up later. It's what I tell people to do now when they're interested. Those business cards you included dried up quick. Maybe I should get a QR code sticker to your site and stick it to the side of the enclosure.

Disclaimer, we are both still alive, and also please don't haul butt in the rain to get home... even if your boards aren't waterproof, take the mechanical hit instead of you hitting the pavement.

Im still confused as to why anyone would go out of their way to put a box under their board to hide their marijuana 😂😂.... but my favorite reaction yet

"AHHHH!!!" - at the moment of passing an overweight brony girl . Assuming she was trying to make me fall
"HONK!" - at the moment of passing by a parked car. assuming they were trying to make me fall.

I always like the surprise when I pull up at lights between cars and they look down at the board then at me (I sometimes commute in casual office wear and just swap shoes) and then smirk as if to say look at this clown. Then I kick off and power away. Rush hour traffic here is so slow and we have loads of bus lanes so I am easily halving the commute time. 

That and the kids reaction when out with parents. You know what is going on their Christmas list this year.
