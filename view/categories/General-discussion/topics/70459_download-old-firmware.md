Anyone know where I can download old versions of the VESC firmware?  I'm looking to downgrade my Flipsky 6.6 from 3.40 to 3.39, as I'm having trouble getting my bluetooth module to connect, and I stumbled on a thread that mentioned 3.40 causes some problems with this:

Could you send me the fw 3.40 files? I need that firmware, and can not find it anywhere.

Thanks.
