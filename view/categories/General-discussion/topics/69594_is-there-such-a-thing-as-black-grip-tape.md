Does jet deep dark black grip tape exist?
I hate regular tapes that are this nasty grey color.

Coarse grips like Vicious https://www.muirskate.com/longboard/products/70272/vicious-extra-coarse-grip-tape-4-sheets-10-x-11 look darker and are the closest I've seen to black. Mob has a coarse grip as well https://www.muirskate.com/longboard/products/73015/mob-grip-super-coarse-grit-black-pack-with-3-11in-x-14in-grip-tape Keep in mind they do get dirty so if you want them to stay dark you should get a brush and clean regularly.

You could:

A. Paint your deck black and use clear grip tape (though it might come out more like a dark grey), or

B. Paint your deck black and use glass frit.

You could:

A. Do it wrong with clear/colored griptape 
Or
B. Do it right and Paint your deck black and use glass frit.

:+1: up for using a proper longboard griptape like Vicious! 
It is pretty well all I will use.

Coarse Visious is also black when it is clean...

It's never clean except when you apply it.  Heck, I have bubblegum in my griptape right now

bubble gum dramatically improves carving ability at speed because it sticks to your shoes better. Best thing you can do is just get your friends to smear their chewed gum on your deck. 

Everybody should do that.

Wait, it has to be chewed first?

I think the best is to put gorilla glue on old shoes and stick them to the deck and that will help you from falling off the board when speed wobble hits.
