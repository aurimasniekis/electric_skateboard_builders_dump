Since the last poll missed some options and was too broad, here is the last one i'll be posting.

 Poll: https://goo.gl/forms/mAug1OOVaUYvGq7A2

Please keep it clean, and only post once. We are all a big family, posting multiple times doesnt help us at all.

There should be an "Others" option.
If not feel free to edit the form, the pencil on the top right.

@abenny, take a look again :slight_smile:

you're welcome.

small notice, last time there was indeed an empty bullet. This is why there is a difference in total votes on the google page and this excel chart. the chart doesn't count empty input, and so is more correct.
