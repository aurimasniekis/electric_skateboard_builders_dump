Here are some awesome looking aluminum longboard decks that would be totally sweet if you made them electric...

They must vibrate so much, you should put shock pads.

Here are my favourite two decks:
Jet Spud:

a year ago i actually ordered (and returned) quite a few boards to test their 3D surface for comfort, locked in feel and versatility. i was suprised how uncomfortable a few boards are! :open_mouth:

the clear winner is my loaded cantellated tesseract! great mold, so many great feeling spots to put your feet, super versatile, very agile, cool amount of flex - its stiff but not dead. just flexible enough to allow some damping, but stiff enough that your battery wont suffer!

https://www.muirskate.com/photos/products/1651/hd_product_Loaded_Cantellated__Set_.png

landyachtz topspeed looks super fast and elegant and a really comfy mold with great locked in feel! its a really grest board, especially after i sanded it down by 1ply! the flares are maybe a tiny wee bit too high or my feet are too long :stuck_out_tongue: 

cant say anything about the vanguard yet, for pushing its too high, but it carves like a snowboard, very different feel compared to the other 2.

I recently did a review of my ThreeSix double drop ... the sibling of the ThreeSix top mount shown above. Vibration is not something I really noticed on the board. There is actually some (minimal) flex in it, and so vibration is really no different to any other stiff downhill board. The fact that it's made of metal doesn't really make much of a difference.

I think a bigger factor in vibration are the wheels; I notice far more vibration on my street board with small hard (95A duro) wheels than on the double drop with big soft wheels.

Here's a link to the review: https://www.reddit.com/r/longboarding/comments/4laksa/gear_review_of_threesix_tennessee_double_drop/

This is on my queue for my next build. I can't get enough of mini cruisers. Landyachtz Dinghy is my favorite deck and it has this very unique, foam style grip.

i feel confident i can squeeze a few mAh onto that deck along with the drive train from an electric slot car, but there's not much room for a receiver. It might have to sit on top between your fingers along with the button cell.

@treenutter Once again i find myself not really competing with mass produced, cookie-cutter completes. I'm pretty sure my new electric fingerboards would out-spec and out-perform this in both range and speed. Probably by several meters. 

@RunPlayBack I'm fiberglassing a tiny box right now, just waiting on some 30awg mains wires and a loupe.

That's so funny you guys mentioned aluminum boards, I'm literally about to launch into my first esk8 build and I'm going to use (I think) the Overland Highland ( http://overlandboards.com/collections/all-products/products/bo-fax-longboard-millvalley-skateboard-aluminum ). Almost all of the electronics will come from Enertion, I'm waiting on a space cell4, r-spec 74mm motor, VESC and pulleys and whatnot. Currently in the waiting phase for that stuff, but in the meantime I'm getting used to the Highland on flat ground and hills. It's pretty wicked. 
If anyone has any pointers to deal with vibration dampening and preserving electronics, I'd love to hear em!

Shock risers are always a good idea to smooth out a ride: https://www.amazon.com/Khiro-Shock-Pad-Inch-Black/dp/B006VXN3XQ/186-4433728-6510043?ie=UTF8&tag=duckduckgo-ipad-20

I also discovered that Ronin cast trucks do a really great job of dampening any vibrations. I only just tried them recently for the very first time, and I have to admit I'm impressed. Add some soft, fat wheels and your ride will be buttery smooth.

I dig this! The company seems really cool, I was actually out in Seattle not too long ago and they have a super robust maker community. As far as a CF board, I actually just got a [Hi5ber Ion 30](http://www.hi5ber.com/#!ion-30/ct95) deck:

Building my own pack, it'll be a compact 12s1p LiFePO4, custom enclosure with VESC and the Carvon single hub. Trying to convert my original mini cruiser to something lightweight but not too small to be dangerous at higher speeds. @Jeff has a Python Hi5ber which is awesome and I think this 30" is their first minicruiser deck.

The ability to run bigger wheels and to adjust your trucks without silly wedges makes this setup a winner for me. Can go from carving to down hill in about 5 minutes. Personally I run the front truck at 58 degrees and the rear truck at 20 degrees giving me nice carves as well as decent downhill capability. Match this with some roja hybrid precision trucks that allow you to control how loose or tight your trucks are and you basically have a board that can do it all with simple adjustments.

After riding my setup for so long, it feels uncomfortable to step on to any other type of longboard, feels like riding a lifeless plank with wheels.

my gbomb has been the only board I never wanted to add a motor, cause pumping is really cool. Im also running it at 60°/20° with DT poppies - but there is NO way I can downhill with that kind of turny front. :stuck_out_tongue:

to put it into perspective: I weight around 85kg with clothes on, shoe size eu 44!

* landyachtz topspeed was cool (off the shelf too stiff imo, nice rocker, pretty high concave, slightly exaggerated wheel wells imo, discontinued)

* loaded cantellated tesseract is amazing (pretty stiff, but some mild flex so it doesnt feel dead, very agile, amazingly flexible stance - youll find a cool spot everywhere with every foot, feels just great under the feet, has a kick tail, can go really ANY speed)

* loaded vanguard flex 2 (42") is hands down my best board (= best carver and long distance tourer, I would say the tesseract is the better allrounder though, at least when you are riding a lot in urban environments)

* jet spud will have to prove itself yet, its a pretty unique design though: very short, very wide and a pretty large wheelbase, very strong concave and wheel wells - its a fun concept. also very cheap and pretty light unlike the 2 loaded boards which are both, expensive and heavy :stuck_out_tongue:

This reply should be on this post ;-)

I've got a top mount 42" Winterstick Pintail which I'm toying with turning into an eboard. Carves awesome. But at my weight it's a bit too flexy.... So thinking maybe build it for someone lighter or figure out how to build so the electrics don't suffer from the flex.

How would you guys do that - put the electrics in two boxes, near each truck, then mount the batteries vertically or horizontally, running the wires btw the two...?

SCP4's dimension of 560mm X 205mm X 31mm
El jefe wheelbase : 600mm long, narrowest points(middle of the board) : 210mm wide.

I think it would fix fine, but be aware of the motor mount if u place it inward(between trucks), b/c by doing so, u can utilize the kicktail. U have 40mm left for it, which i think just enough.

Edit: 40mm is kinda tight, depends on which mount u use.

My board is similar to to chakas, but I have concave. I know it probably looks like I copied him to some degree, but i had this idea over a year ago, I just wasn't able to make it until a few weeks ago.

I finished up the lid today. It looks like one solid piece with the lid. I plan to add 2 more layers to the bottom for strength. No build thread yet. I'm debating how to fit everything inside. I have these 16Ah batteries, but they take up the entire hollow space. So I need to use a smaller battery so I can fit the quad vesc's inside. I'm leaning on making this 11Ah 12s battery from a bunch of little lipos. But idk if the tabs on the cells have an amp limit. So I'm still debating how to fit everything inside.

I really admire chaka's and your effort to sink electronics completely into the board and I dont think there is a copyright on "sinking in electronics into your board" :stuck_out_tongue: . the thing i really dont like about these kind of decks is: they always look like tanks cause they need to have at least 2cm height to accomodate 18650 cells. 
aesthetically its much more pleasing to MY eyes at least with a slim board edge and a partially sunk in enclosure, which you barely notice from typical viewing angles (unless you are VERY short :joy: ).
if I would sink in my electronics into a board, I would probably go with flat lipo pouches to get rid of the tank looks.

or maybe center the cells and slim down the edges to normal board levels, so it looks just like strong concave from the usual viewing angles! that would be an elegant way to "hide" the thickness in a visually pleasing way!

Likewise, I think screwing containers to the bottom of a longboard makes them look like a pregnant guppy or a package of lunchables. :laughing: Plus, how else are you going to fit 70+ cells on a deck?  Personally I find the thickness of my decks to be visually pleasing, thin decks look inadequate to me know. :stuck_out_tongue:  I can feel your frustration though, it is not easy to make decks in this fashion. You may think routing out the bottom of the deck and bolting a tray is a good idea but you will probably end up with cracking and eventual failure if you ride aggressively. Boards should have some backbone. 

I also want to add that I in no way think I should be the only one making hollow core composite eboards. The more people making them the better! 

We now have another term for the eboarding lexicon, the lunchable!

you know, I decided against composite materials. I'm going all all wood. I had a layer offiberglass on the bottom that I ripped off yesterday as It didn't look the best (never really dried, even after a week in the sun) and it doesn't need it. My deck is strong enough as it is right now, but theres screw holes visble from the bottom, some I'm going to do 2 more layers on the bottom to cover the holes and give just a bit of extra strength. So far with the lid, I'm at 20 layers, might end up at 22 total (16 layers is 1 inch.

I personally think the enclosures on the bottom are ugly. I'd rather have a thicker deck with all the componets inside rather than an enclosure bulding out.)

Love @Chaka's hollow core setup, but it wasn't the first as i recall.

I have an Omen Chief i'm setting up similar to rs4race who did his in Aug 2014.  Omen had a few extra double thick decks and i've routered out a huge chunk to house electronics.  [Here's his original thread](https://endless-sphere.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=35&t=62751) - pretty impressive given 2 years ago!

Love the enclosed electronics option!  One of the things i love about my Marbel - stealth.  I also have a new Subsonic foam core to wrap next to recreate my e-GBomb - but with enclosed electronics this time.  Ultimately i've been practicing lately w/ these so i can do the next e-GBomb proper and get my skills where they need to be to do it justice.  On the shelf waiting patiently...  I'm slow remember!  ;)

So many cool decks - it's hard to limit to just one build!

I'll just call it enclosed electronics.  They will be under a lid of some sort (gf/cf/kydex etc.) and as flush as possible to fit the size batteries i want for range.  

I want mine accessible and swappable for more range by swapping batteries.  But KISS - no BMS and basic HK lipos currently.  Might eventually join you cool kids w/ BMS and 18650 packs... but will wait till my existing lipos have issues and need to be replaced.

heh, not sure why you would think that - unidirectional carbon is so incredibly strong ... after riding the heavily routed spud and jumping a few stairs on my first testride I feel that the board is actually stronger than stock now with the 3 carbon layers. we have seen boards that snap after routing on this forum, but to be honest, Im almost certain that the particular picture that I have in mind probably didnt have a good bond between board and carbon, which of course is deadly, since once it delaminates, the whole stability is gone. thats why I prepare the boards wood with very rough P40 grid before I lay carbon!

in the same fashion I could proclaim "these hollow core skeletons of a board, you may think its a good idea but you will probably end up with cracking and eventual failure if you ride agressively. boards should be solid and not hollow!". :stuck_out_tongue: 

I didnt have a snapped board yet in a total of probably around 3000km - do you? :sunglasses:

you most likely didnt add enough hardener. its very important to be precise on the mix and then really take your time to stirr it up really well. I always use a stopwatch to make sure that I stirr for at least 2 minutes! :slight_smile:

I feel pretty confident that my modified double thick deck will hold up.  I have multiple layers of 12k CF on top, uni CF and angled CF tube w/ 3k on bottom.  But i'll be sure to slowly ride and stress it to check before going full speed!

Haha don't be so sensitive, Just trying to give you a bit of friendly advice. Carbon fiber is great but you are really not getting any benefit by adding it to an area with neutral flex. You are relying purely on the strength of the two outer stringers.

http://www.concretecountertopinstitute.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Beam2.jpg

On a hollow core deck you rely on having a strong composite skin along the entire bottom length of the board. A board built similar to your last build should still have a central stringer to help take the load. Either way preach on brother, peace be with you!

I did exactly what the instructions said. 28 grams of fiberglass resign to 10 drops of hardener. I also stirred for quite some time, at least 2 minutes. Either way, it's not necessary. hummie and I did some testes doing small jumps in the center of the board, and its as solid as can be. The board I used to mold it is more flexible than my board. And I'm adding 2 more layers on the bottom just to give it even more re-enforcement and hide some screw inserts.

@chaka A good hollow core depends on having a strong few "base" layer(s). In my case, I have 3 solid pieces (face, cross, face), and will add another cross and face to make it 5 layers (while a normal board is 7-11 layers). The spar structure takes a lot of load, as I'm sure you have seen with your board. With only 3 layers of wood on the bottom and no CF or FG, the board barely bends. It's very stiff, sue to the spars on the side and the middle. In your case, you use a composite of materials, mainly carbon fiber. As long as you create a stong base (with whatever materials you choose), you should be fine.

On a completely different topic, you solve my problem of where to put the vescs by using 3 hollow channels instead of 2. How wide/long is your deck?

Your bottom layer is still regarded as a laminate/composite but you will want something with a bit more tensile strength if you get really thin.  3 layers should be fine, figure a park deck is only 7 layers, only the bottom 3 layers are under any stress.

My boards are usually about 10 inches wide. The central cavity is nice and it allows you to extend your batteries all the way to the wheel cutouts.

Hello! Looking for some
Options as far as decks that the enertion space cell enclosure can fit on. Currently have a dusters deck that works fine. Just looking for different styles of decks!

[quote="chaka, post:96, topic:4376"]
Carbon fiber is great but you are really not getting any benefit by adding it to an area with neutral flex. You are relying purely on the strength of the two outer stringers.
[/quote]

the "neutral area" is still the middle of a boards material, no matter how thin I route it ... and the stretching area is always the lower half. 
that is the reason why thinner boards have to be more flexy when you use a thinner and a thicker board both with the same material: the elongation -> tension becomes much higher with increasing thickness, because the material has to extend more. mathematically speaking: in your picture you bend a straight line into a circle segment = increasing its former length when bending on the lower half of the material, compressing and reducing its former length on the upper half of the material. now, the thicker a board is, the larger the outer arc segments becomes when you bend it = the more it stretches. 

now, since the board becomes a lot thinner in a few parts due to routing, its up to the tensile strength of a material to make up for the lack of elongation, at least if you want to preserve the flex ... and cfk has about 10x the tensile strength of hard wood, so no issues here. but in the end the bond of the carbon to the wood is crucial too because the shear forces connecting the layers really help out on the stiffness and stability! so one should always make sure that the epoxy can really grip into the wood, hence the roughed up surface with P40!

its actually a good moment to talk about "should I add cfk/gfk ontop or on roadside"?

GFK has a very similar compressive and tensile strength, so for gfk it actually doesnt matter if you put it ontop of the board or below.

CFK has a better tensile strength - about 2x as much as compressive strength for the materials Im using, so if you put it ontop of the board, youll only get half of the effect compared to roadside.

but: lets say you have a board of 1cm thickness and you add another 1cm CFK roadside, then the new "neutral area" of chaka is the boards former roadside and you added a lot of cfk close to the "neutral area". in that case it would be better to add CFK at both sides evenly to get the stiffest result.

in practice that example of course does not really happen - even 2-3 layers of carbon are thinner than a singly ply of wood! :slight_smile:

[quote="evoheyax, post:97, topic:4376"]
I did exactly what the instructions said. 28 grams of fiberglass resign to 10 drops of hardener. I also stirred for quite some time, at least 2 minutes.
[/quote]

if your resin didnt cure, its because it lacked hardener - no other explanation! "10 drops" is also a really fishy way of measuring (unless you meant 10gr). in such small quantities, its probably better to mix by volume and not by weight. it IS really crucial to be precise and the smaller the quantities get, the bigger your relative error. if in doubt its surely better to use too much than too little hardener - with too much hardener, the physical properties wont be as good, but it will cure at least. with too little hardener, parts of the resin will never cure. :neutral_face:

the 107mm Electric Flywheels are M O N S T E R S ! ! !  I have a set.  Thing to be aware - the regular gears will not fit.  The 107 wheels are much deeper and you need to get some spacers to fit the gear.  I'm trying to figure out a better way to do this now.  Wishing i had the skills to 3d print that spacer to matchup w/ DIYes 40t gear!  I'll try to post up some pics on a dedicated thread.  I know a few folks got them to fit, but not exactly sure how.

As for decks - it's going to be tought even w/ some of the downhill symetrical boards w/ large cutouts.  I'm not sure if they'll fit on my Vanguard, but they did fit on my GBomb!

It's bigger than a jet spud, but my new favorite deck is the landyachts top speed 36.  Slight W concave, great feel on carves, very stable at high speeds and frikkin beautiful.

Hey guys a mere lurker here, yet to start my build as I have hit a wall with deciding on the deck. Eyeing the DIY scene and exploring the amazing builds I fell in love with the Spud builds. I put together a plan, had it all figured out with the [Potato 29"](https://www.muirskate.com/longboard/decks/71818/jet-2016-potato-29-longboard-skateboard-deck-w-grip) being the first item on my shopping list. Unfortunately the first place I looked at didn't have any in stock, not a problem, I'll just order it somewhere else right? Wrong.

After emailing around I came to the conclusion that there is not a single piece of that deck available for purchase on planet earth. The Potato 29" should be in stock maybe 4 weeks from now, but I don't know if I want to wait that long, the ever so short summer of Finland is close and I want to be on a board as soon and for as long as possible.

So I began exploring further options. I'm looking for a short/mini (29"-33") downhill/freeride deck as carrying my board around with easy is the top criteria for my build. On the longer end of that my dreamboard would be the [Truncated Tesseract](https://www.muirskate.com/longboard/decks/43061/loaded-truncated-tesseract-longboard-skateboard-deck-w-grip) but as a university student I can't stretch my budget enough to fit that in. One thing I've been looking into is [Jet Vulcan Banger 33"](https://www.muirskate.com/longboard/decks/71833/jet-2016-vulcan-banger-33-longboard-skateboard-deck-w-grip) as kind of a budget Tesseract.

If you have a deck to suggest, or any input on the things I babbled here please let me know!

I have the Arbor Highground on my Torqueboards dual hub/space cell 3 setup. It's a great stiff deck that isn't too long overall, and it has a really long wheelbase that is very customizeable. The aggressive concave took some getting used to. I also added a small footstop on the rear to slide my rear foot to the back of the deck without looking down as my foot slipped off the back once and that wasn't pleasant. Either way it's a great deck, and I'll certainly be equipping another arbor backlash 37 I got on the cheap. Also keep an eye out for the open box or lightly used options on Amazon. I got my boards for $28 (highground) and $38 (backlash) shipped and both came wrapped brand new.
