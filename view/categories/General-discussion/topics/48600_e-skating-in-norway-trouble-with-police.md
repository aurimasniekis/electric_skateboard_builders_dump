Hello.
Is there many people here from norway?
Do you get stopped by the police if you ride your e-board?

I have been driving past the police in TromsÃ¸ without any problem. I had lights on. Think I have read somewhere that you should be above 16y old, have lights on and dont drive above 20km/h, and you should be fine.

Meybe i should invest in some lights then. :thinking:  What is the easiest/cheapest way to get "legal" lights on your board?
Are there many here on the forum from Norway?

Small LED bike lights are good enough, just find a way to mount them properly, the ones with rubber bands seems to vibrate loose all the time on my trucks.

Would also like to know how many are from Norway. I know from experience that its hard to get hold of eboard parts in Norway without having to pay half the price in shipping and import taxes. I have designed and ordered a small batch of milled motor mounts for all motor sizes and with idler pulleys. In 7075 aluminium black anodized, if anyone is interested. I will make a thread about them soon.

[quote="Mikaelj, post:7, topic:48600"]
you should be above 16y old
[/quote]
IN Ireland If you're under 16 years old your classified as a young offender. Meaning that your crimes won't really be punished something about not at the age to know what they're doing LOL.

well, I'm no criminal But I see gipsies getting away with everything from Throwing rocks at Gardi (police) cars and Robbing anything under 300 Euros. And the Garda well I just think they're incompetent can't blame them.

They never try to pin bylaws on people if there was a bicycle on a sidewalk going fast 80% of the time they wouldn't say anything. If you're polite they will just say thank you for listing. but I saw angry gipsies cursing at them and getting away scot free So I dunno.

In Croatia police reacts to everything over 30â‚¬ and over 16 you are punished as an adult...
But the police isnt so effective...

They dont care, i even have a goped like a scooter with a 43cc engine and I drive past them every day they just give a thumb up and go their way
But I thini everything over 50cc and 1kw needs to be registered and you need to have a licence

Yeah drunk drivers going 10mph over the limit pay like what 20 euros (In Moscow country side etc much cheaper)
Also, a Ticket is not an option they threaten to take your licence etc.

Ya but howâ€™s your experience with the guards been  around eskating and whatâ€™s our rights like?..your dead on treat em normally and donâ€™t act fool they normally (sometimes you just get a robocop dickhead) theyr normally alri but iv not yet been eskating as Iâ€™m finishing my build ..just interested if youâ€™ve had any run ins

Well Sorry never esk8ted before but Im sure they won't do anything. and as for "Robo Dickheads"
Just play nice and If they somehow really really suck Well you're screwed because they can pull out there police bat and hit you in places nobody else can see :policeman: :hammer:

But on my push longboard I was going not to fast about 25km/h At a police Stop point and carving hard like Around every car I mean it looks scary like some snake Bam Bam left right another car and There was a lot of cops there and at the bottom of some other cops breath he said Could you please stop.
So most police are cool and it's awkward for them to yell or say anything against.

Is it easy to make a speed limiter with a vesc?

The article basically says the same as the official rules, nothing new really. 
Here is the offical rules for reference:
https://www.vegvesen.no/kjoretoy/Eie+og+vedlikeholde/elkjoretoy/sma-elektriske-kjoretoy
As long as your board isnt longer than 120cm and goes faster than 20km/h you are within the rules. However my board goes 55 km/h and I have never experienced problems with the cops. As long as you ride safely and take it easy around others you shouldnt have any problems.  

There is very easy to set a speed limiter on the vesc firmware.

As long as you use the certified road legal norwegian Whooshboards mounts, the cops will not bother you but rather ask "where the hell did you get them rad looking mounts from?" ðŸ˜‚

Hey dude. I've been skating e-skate in Oslo for the past 3 years.. Almost daily for commuting and my route takes me past police hq and lots of police hotspots, Brugata/G.LÃ¸kka/Oslo S etc and never once had a strange look from them.. These days there are sooo many e-scoots around I don't think they care as long as you ain't smashing it through peds. The law on esk8 is currently the same as e-scoots/e-bikes. Gotta have lights, bell(don't know how this works with sk8) and max speed of 20-22km. But stuff the speed and bell.. I just don't hoon around high density areas and it's fine.
