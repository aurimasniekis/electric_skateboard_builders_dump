I have been wanting to build a e-mountainboard for a while and have been reading quite a bit about it. As far as I can tell there are quite a few vendors available for different parts when it comes to regular skateboards/longboards but not as much when it comes to mountainboards.

I was thinking of getting a MBS 90 (possibly the X version with brake) and then building some sort of motor mount for it myself. The part I am getting stuck on is where I can buy sprockets and belts that fit the MBS FiveStar hubs. In many threads, such as this one: http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/designing-new-mbs-matrix-motor-mount/10899 The belt drive itself with sprockets and belts are not discussed as much as the motor mounts. And again in this thread the concepts of what belt drive gearing I need are discussed, but not where to get them. http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/beginners-guide-to-building-your-own-electric-skateboard-drivetrain/53?source_topic_id=215
It could also be that I'm simply not searching for the right terms..

So my question is, where are you guys buying the sprockets and belts for your mountainboards, and more specifically where can I get the parts that would fit an MBS colt 90 board with FiveStar Hubs?

You can look at http://www.beltingonline.com/timing-pulleys-bars-272/htd5-pulleys-285/to-suit-25mm-wide-belt-483/
They have pulleys and belts, but you obviously need to adapt the pulleys to fit your wheels.
The Belt length depends on your center to Center distance.
You can calculate the needed length here:http://www.beltingonline.com/b-section-length-calculator-8406
And then buy them Here: http://www.beltingonline.com/5mm-htd-timing-belts-4575

Aha ok, so there are no sprockets available that just bolt on to the wheels, I need to buy something and drill the holes there myself. That would explain why I havent found any ;)

Hey Kaly,

I wonder if the Colt 90 is a good platform for electric MTB. In all set ups I see for MBS everyone is using matrix pro II trucks.. anyone here built eSk8 using the colt 90?
