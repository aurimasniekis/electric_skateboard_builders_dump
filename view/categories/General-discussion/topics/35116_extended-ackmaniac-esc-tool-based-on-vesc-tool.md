## PPM changes

**Current control is like the old Watt control mode**

Finally, Watt Mode is made especially to give you much more control at higher speeds. At the beginning, you think the VESC has less power but then you learn that you simply have to pull the trigger a bit more. And when you start to carve at higher speeds you will definitely feel the difference. And another advantage is that when you set a watt limit (motor settings) the power feels the same over the whole battery capacity.

"Current" Control Mode works like "Current no reverse with Brake" with the difference that you also have a reverse. The only problem with the standard reverse function is that when you brake hard the wheels can start to spin backward while you still move forward.
.
**To avoid that i added the parameters "Enable maximum ERPM for direction switch"**

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/7/b/7be5603226b3ada75215271e5c2891a28ca2f7d6.png" width="690" height="235">

When this is enabled and you brake hard then the brakes will work like in "Watt with no reverse". To drive backward you have to release the throttle and brake again. But this only works when you are below the ERPM (4000 in the picture). If you are above it will brake normally again.
When you drive backwards and you are above 4000 ERPM in the backwards direction then it will accelerate backwards and won't brake. If you are below 4000 ERPM backwards and you accelerated shortly to go forward and brake again then it will enable the normal brake again. To drive backwards you have to release the throttle and brake again.
.
How do i find the perfect ERPM for that parameter?_
The best is to go down a hill. Then do a full brake. You will see that the motors are not able at very low speed to stop the board from moving. If the value is set correct you can now release the throttle and brake again and the motors should start to accelerate backwards. If that is not the case then the value is too low. In my tests 4000 ERPM worked very well. For most setups that is like 4 km/h.
-
It sounds complicated but it becomes very intuitive after a short while. If you don't need it to go backwards then just simply use "Watt no reverse with Brake"

**PID speed control no acceleration**

This mode is experimental, when you press the throttle then it only activates the Cruise Control and hold the speed. Brakes work as normal. So there is no acceleration. This might be good to legalize the board in some Countries.

**Offset for Traction Control**

Problem is that the standard firmware always reduces the power at one VESC when traction control is enabled. Because the RPM reading of the VESC is not very precise and can differ by +-400 RPMS. And that means that at 500 updates per second the Current for the VESC bounces a lot. Alos when you make do a curve then the inner wheel is slower than the outer wheel. So the outer wheel will get less power and by this it creates a power steering. To prevent this you can define an offset where the VESC should not reduce the power and deliver the same current to both VESCs. Above that offset, the normal traction control will step in. If you set this to 3000 for the most setups this will not enable traction control if the speed difference between both VESCs is lower than 3 km/h.So the traction control only reduces the power when it is really needed.

## Cruise Control for dual setups via steering channel connected to the second VESC:
At the slave Vesc the steering channel can be connected and in the PPM settings the "Cruise Control via Secondary Channel" can be activated. This enables the cruise control when the throttle is not pulled and the steering channel is turned more than 30% to left or right. In this mode braking is always possible, just to avoid stupid reactions in a shocking moment. And when you pull the throttle the cruise control will also be deactivated to avoid that the throttle is accidentally pulled while cruise control is active and then have a big surprise when cruise control is released. So i hope that i can avoid scary situations.
I recommend to set the Speed control settings in the Advanced tab to 0,00300 for KP and KI and leave KD to 0,00000. 
For cruise control the 2nd ESC need to be connected via can bus and the Slave ESC needs to send the status via can. The Master ESC needs have "Multiple ESCs over Can" enabled.

In the picture above you see that you have additional options when you use the steering to activate the Cruise Control.
You can define what should happen when the Pulsewidth is negative (lower than 50%) or positive (higher than 50%). If you use the motor settings the behavior will be like you set it up in the Motor advanced tab. Otherwise, you can define if you want to allow the speed controller that it can use the brakes if you go faster or not. 
For example it is possible when you steer right that cruise control Â´doesn't brake when you are too fast and when you steer left that it dos use the brakes. This way you can use the cruise control for carving and downhill. 

Hint: mostly when you steer right it gives lower signal and when you steer left it gives a higher signal.

## Nunchuk changes
- Nunchuk also has the Offset for Traction Control
- Buttons can be mirrored
- Cruise control is changed so that for a dual drive the speed of both wheels will be taken into account and adjusted individually
- When Current without reverse is used then one button is for cruise with brake and the other for cruise without brake.
- When Current with reverse is used then braking will be disabled during cruise control and can  be activated by short brake pulse while cruise control is active.

## Timeout Behavior
I spent a lot of time to find a good solution to make the board safer when the connection to the remote is lost.
**What is the Issue with the standard firmware?**
When the remote looses the connection the the ESC immediately switches to the defined timeout current after the defined timout time which is mostly 1000ms (1s). in most cases this is 0 A. 
So if it happens during acceleration then the ESC will continue to accelerate for 1s with the last known throttle position and the cut off the power immediately. If the signal comes back now the power will be back imediately. So it can happen that the ESC acdcelerates with 80A, then goes to 0 and back to 80A. 
Mostly this was a very good chance for a very bad crash.
And it got even worse when a brake current is defined when a timeout happens.

The solution i added is a soft ramping from the actual current to the defined timout current. So a brake current can be defined because it will smoothly change from acceleration to braking. And if the signal comes back it will also ramp smoothly to the actual throttle position. So the times when the board wanted to throw you off should be a thing of the past.
And to be able to still push the board the automatic braking will disable itself once the motor comes to a complete stop for 1 second. (Be aware that you should only push the board when the ESC is switched on)

**BUT actually this works out of the BOX for Nunchuk and NRF.**

**For PPM this is also possible**. But it is a bit difficult to set it up and it doesn't work with every remote because the Failsafe signal needs to be adjustable.

**Instructions for PPM with adjustable Failsafe:**
At the mini remote the failsafe is adjustable by removing the bind plug while the throttle is in idle. By this the receiver knows what signal it should send as default if the connection to the remote is lost.
But this looks like a idle position for the ESC. 
So we need to tell the ESC that the signal is lost an this can be achieved by adjusting a failsafe signal that is far below or above the min or maximum signal.

So for example when your remote is adjusted then min and max is like in the next 2 pictures
**Minimum** 
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/2/0/20577be728a9c8fd0d846eeb06f5f81442e66334.png" width="690" height="96">
**Maximum**
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/e/4/e4dacb9d5035c5b4672ecb54a9245679820cb40a.png" width="690" height="91">

To set a failsafe signal that is far off i attach the bind plug and turn the potentiometer on the remote totally to the left and pull the throttle 100%. That gives me a signal of 
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/1/5/155e3f5386e3039724bfcf540cc4691f8941912b.png" width="690" height="89">
In that moment i remove the bind plug to tell the receiver to send this signal if the connection is lost.
Afterwards i turn the poti back to the normal position (best is to adjust min, max and center again). 

When you switch off the remote now you should see the signal that is far off. In my case it shows 170% in brackets (in the picture above). If the signal is above 120% the ESC knows that the signal is lost.
Now you can define a timeout current in the General settings. Safe the settings and let the motor spin with the remote. When the motor spins switch of your remote. Now the motor should brake automatically. 
On the bench it seems that it brakes hard but test it on the street at low speed. You will feel that the bakes apply gently. If you test this during acceleration you will also feel that the acceleration power is ramped down gently and brake increases.
The ramp current is 50A /s decreasing and 20A/s increasing. So from 50A to -15 it would need 1 second to decrease to 0 and then from 0 to -15 it woulkd take 0,75s to -15. If you have dual drive connected via CAn the slave will do the same as long as the same timeout brake current is adjusted.

I recommend to set a brake current of -10A or -15A which will slow you down even downhill. And also the timeout ms should be set to 500ms so that the ramping starts very soon when the connection is lost.

_**It would be cool if you would send me a donation if you think that this timout behavior saved your skin and bones.**_

## Watts Limit usage
IMPORTANT you have to do this for each motor individually, Master and Slave.
If you set this value to 1000 Watts then 25 % throttle will be 250 watts and 100% throttle will be 1000 watts. Of course, the throttle curve will have an influence. 
The battery max has the higher priority, So if the battery max is set to 10A and your battery has 36V then you can only produce 360W maximum. If you set the value to 1000 Watts then you can only use 36 % of your throttle because afterward the battery max blocks a higher power output.
So just make sure that the battery max allows the VESC to produce that many watts. You can also easily limit the VESCs power output with this parameter so that it would be very easy for the kids to ride the board.

## Other changes
- Hall sensor in BLDC mode has a hysterysis which results in a smoother switch from sensor to sensorless mode
- Cruise control works different and smoother than in the standard or previous 2.54 firmware
- FOC for FOXBOX works
- My app is supported
- Brakes can be stronger than acceleration. This way a weak acceleration but strong brakes can be defined which should be safe for kids. 
- For a 4WD different settings can be used for the front and back axle
- ESC-Tool shows in the realtime data graph also the speed and distance based on the settings in the additional information tab. 
- Throttle curves shows more grid lines to better see the effect on the power curve.
- Throttle cuves have one more mode which is called "Expo-Natural"

When you install the failsafe you should make sure that it works by testing it first on the bench and then at low speed on the street. Be aware that the same failsafe current should be set for Master and Slaves if you have more than one motor.

"Cruise Control via Secondary Channel" is only used at the slave ESC. It doesn't give any power commands. It only tells the master if cruise control (tempomat) is active and if enabled that braking is allowed or not at cruise. The master controls the power so it depends which mode is active at the master.

The pulse width gets set correctly just like in your bldc tool. But even after applying the right values and it shows it as center. If I pull the trigger/Brake all the way it stops but if it goes near the center it start spinning up.

I just realized that my inquiry was dumb since you **did** include the Ackmaniac-ESC TOOL sources in the ZIP. Sorry for the bother and insistance but allow me to be more accurate : 

Can you please upload a ZIP with the uncompiled sources of your modded FW / the raw file directory of your modded bldc-master ? 

I'm redundant but I got different assigned GPIOs on my VESCs (and also 0.0005ohms resistors) and need to make mods in few files then compile myself any upcoming FW. Currently I've made variants of original 3.28, 3.29 and a variant of 2.54 based on your older bldc-master directory.

Better power management, which means a better overall torque/power, a better control, more reliability due to this and less fried DRVs issues (less spikes, better motor sync I think). You manage also more range.

Maybe a stupid question (or maybe I misunderstood something) , but why did you fork the 3.x VESC FW ? It wasn't possible to contribute directly in the VESC projet ? I saw others guys in this forum having pull request accepted in the VESC Project. Better to work all together, no ?

You are doing a great job and you do have very good ideas, but this fork you'll make the support of this FW version harder for mobile application like "eskate VESC for iOS".

That's pretty inaccurate.

You see vedder hasn't always merged ack's PRs. But ack has always pulled in the bug fixes to his builds... Acks firmware has always been a little more "complete" and geared toward esk8. Vedder is covering all forms of use cases with the vesc tool.

As well regarding supported iOS/android apps..lol you realize you still need Bluetooth and no one ever changes the UART telemetry right?

This is kind of crazy. @Ackmaniac and vedder thank you so much, this is awesome. On previous hw 2.54 I wouldn't pull anywhere near 20A on my pack, now I pull a lot more amps and have insanely more torque on foc. (all of the settings are the same.)

Hi guys, I really don't want to clutter this beautiful thread but I think I may have just screwed up the firmware update and could really do with some help.  I have a slightly older FOCBOX - V1.3 on the board, have just downloaded the new Extended Ackmaniac-ESC Tool (which looks glorious btw) tried to install the new firmware; I selected 410 & 411 & 412 but it hung on 99.7% and I got the spinning wheel timer on my mac which stayed on for the last 20 mins so I disconnected the FOCBOX and now I don't get the 3 flashing lights on start up (it pauses then just goes to solid green) and it won't connect.  Have a ruined my FOCBOX?  Is there a way back from here?  Happy to set this up as a new topic to not distract from the awesome content on here :sweat: just let me know.

Any help would be hugely appreciated - hopefully any response will help others avoid doing the same, or help resolve the issue.

Thanks guys,

Dan

I changed many things in the PPM and Nunchuk (NRF) handling. Also the way acceleration and power is handled is different to the original version. Also the Timeout ramping handling needs a lot of changes.

But i realized that it would take forever that my ideas would find it's place in the original. And i simply don't have the time to wait for months and discuss everything to death before something happens. I am more interested in development and finding solutions.
Also Benjamin don't seem to be active on the project in the last couple of weeks (of course i could be wrong here). Also my questions in the VESC-Project forum were never answered by him. 

And the biggest problem are the changes that are needed that all the features of my app work. And i am pretty sure Benjamin isn't interested to implement that stuff only for my app.

Sadly i had to give the tool it's own name because of the Trademark policy's. I would have preferred that it is clearly visible that it is only a extension.

Long story short. I do this for fun and not for business. And to discuss and fight for every little change is no fun for me.

Just unplug the USB cable, stop the ACKMANIAC-ESC tool and switch off the VESC. Then connect and start everything again. With the new firmware the FOCBOX won't flash 3 times anymore on startup (same as official version)

Ok, that's reassuring - hadn't realised that and assumed there was an issue.  The mac version keeps hanging with the spinning wheel but the PC version (cheekily just installed it on my work asset -shhhhh) seems to have picked it back up again showing version 3.100 is installed - am I back in the game?  I guess it would be unresponsive until I set up it again right??  Thanks for the immediate response - you're a legend and I'll be sure to hit the donate button once I get her spinning :blush:

Nothings wrong with the telemetry, I'm simply stating your reasoning that other apps will be harder to support is wrong, because none of the Devs have changed the outward packets data set. Only the inward packets for firmware configuration. 
You realize all the 2.xx firmware variations can work with all the phone appa, same thing with all the 3.2x versions, its because there's no value in changing the telemetry data set on the firmware variations...  If you don't do code, let me rephrase it. We have a book called vesc, with a chapter called telemetry. A dev may change the cover of the book or other chapters, but the telemetry stays the same, the words don't change, and the language/formatting doesn't change, so all the apps can still "read" it

Amen.
To be honest, I gave up since a while now collaborating with this project.
And I'm really sad. After so many hours spent testing, reporting bugs and more (remember the VESC 6 protocol), and never got any consideration for my requests, I'm figuring out that I wasted a lot of (precious) time. :(
Anyway, as always said and as @Vanarian tells very well : your skills are amazing though.

@Deckoz  My turn to say you: it's pretty inacurate.

I'm the autor of the iOS eSkate VESC app:
[http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/new-version-2-0-ios-eskate-vesc-app-for-standard-and-ackmaniac-fw/32340](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/new-version-2-0-ios-eskate-vesc-app-for-standard-and-ackmaniac-fw/32340)

I can confirm you, that all the latest version (2.18, 2.54, 3.27) did modify the command interface. And I have specific code for each of this version.

For this reason I'm complaining about seeing a new fork of the FW, because it make our work more difficult. And for the users all this version stream make it difficult to understand and diagnostic compatibility problems.

I can perfectly understand Nicola's answer, and we are all working on that for fun and not for money. 
You know it's easier to work alone than together, but has the proverb say: 
> If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together

Maybe a good solution for everybody, would be to put the ackmaniac extension on Github has a fork of the VESC Project (there are already a lot of fork of the vesc project). This will: 
* permit to Nicolas to keep the freedom of making the choice he want, without loosing time in discussion.
* make easier to follow the modification for the apps developper, like @rpasichnyk and @emmaanuel 
* Clarify the perimeter of the modification done by Nicolas versus the code from Benjamin project
* allow to merge into the VESC project all the good ideas from Nicolas
* allow to keep ackmaniac up to date about all the good ideas from the VESC Project.

The command interface is different then the telemetry data set. 

The data set in all 2.x firmwares is the same. The 3.2x firmware data structure is slightly different but not likely to be modified further.

Executing commands over the UART interface is different then the telemetry packet.

Usually I would have let let the discussion here, but itâsânot accurate...
Even in 2.x the voltage scale has been modified in the ackmaniac 2.54, but you look pretty sure nothing has change... so itâs ok for me but itâs false.... 
so nothing has change and all my code has been added for nothing. Itâs easy to tell us what we have to do without realy knowledge about the firmware modification... like Nicolas iâm Stopping to speak about this subject, Iâm not going to support this fork anymore until the version are clear enough.

Hi everyone! We will ad an "Ethos" page soon and will provide a section in the VESC-Forum about the VESC-Project itself. This non so much tech related but rather a room to debate the Project itself. 

We will ad a structure to enter feature requests, so that they can be worked in.
This will be a e.g. a table where you can drop in the feature and post a link for further explanation. 
We will then drop the request into a fixed ToDo list that is worked down by priority. Sometimes A needs to be solved before B

The last 6 weeks were very busy and in consequence not everyone got the answers they wanted.
VESC-Tool is just public for a short time now, so don't be to demanding.
We had the summer vacations, a surgery to extract some Titanium, work on the website, 3 x FW revision etc.
Please don't forget that you are many while Benjamin is a single person and he has a full time job at this stage.
We want to encourage other experienced users to help out as well, and keep an eye on posts from others.

This is the way forward: 

If you write code for the VESC-Project:
1. Once the structure is online, drop your request there.
2. ad your user name, so everyone knows who you are. 
3. make a pull request and submit code

If you don't write Code:
1. Once the structure is online, drop your demand there.
2. ad your user name, so everyone knows who you are.
3. Write a post about the feature for further explanation and link this post in the feature list.

**To make it very clear:** Benjamin doesn't like to see those forks for many reasons.

The VESC-Project is a terrible amount of work and VESC-Tool took almost two years to code.
This was only possible with a lot of work after work and a hell of patience.
Like a business, the project has costs to shoulder (e.g. a new server is being installed right now, a high speed glass fibre connection was installed and has a monthly bill, travel expenses, advice, accountant, prototypes, computers etc.)
So far no money went into "paying Ben for the countless hours he banged on stuff" but rather lowering the base cost.
Please note that a fork with some new features still is 99.5% of Benjamin's code and is only possible because he supplied the code under the GPL V3. 

The VESC-Project has the doors wide open as an invitation to work together on a strong single version.
A website has been created to give the project a home. If possible, the door should be used to step in.

To write code that interacts seamless with another you need to know what comes next and which dependencies exist.
This is a very good reason to work together on one version, rather than splitting things apart. 
Forks drift versions apart and therefore create incompatibilities in future. This is either wanted by the fork to create a USPs and divert users to the own fork, or it happens without purpose. 
**Both is not good for the community and the project itself.**

To me Benjamin seems pretty 'off the grid' . The vesc-project forum is pretty dead, and Benjamin is not answering many quistions in there. I still find it pretty funny that he is not on the World greatest Esk8 forum. Thats why i like the work Acmaniac is doing in here. He is pretty active, and help a lot when people have quistions. 
And i find it a little bit funny to, that FOC on Focbox is working on his 'forkd version' but still not in the official version. And i like to run FOC. And since nobody seems to know what's is going on in Benjamins head, and any ETA's. I can't wait anymore. I want FOC now ð

 @Silverline I wanna echo that.

Sure, Frank i understand what you say about problems of forking.
Still i'm very thankful to @Ackmaniac that he is not as patient as we should be....
and skilled enough to just implement what he wants from a firmware and software.

So actually i do not think that this will get a totally separate fork, @Ackmaniac is just faster in implementing users wishes (or probably his own).

And sure I'm at least aware that VESC-Tool is made by Benjamin and thanks man thats awsome.
But what's the Problem if someone (@Ackmaniac) is developing it further ?  (and that in enormous speed, where do you take all that time Nico ?)

@trampa have you tried @Ackmaniac's Soft/Firmware ? 
If you use ppm, Focbox, Dual-Setup and want FOC, Cruise-Control,.... this Soft/Firmware here is the only choice. Same is valid for the old BLDC-Tool people who had hope that Benjamin would implement new features would have been dissapointed, thanks to Ackamaniac that he went on .

So, peace People
And i also hope that this will get a community Project once, but till then you freay programmers, please keep on developing stuff like you want and think it's the best.

Theres a good reason Ben isnt in alot of forums.

From the start Ben answerd alot of questions if not all. But eventually, answering questions started taking up hours. Even days. For awhile he had hundreds of emails per day to answer. Simply wasn't sustainable. Therefor he chooses to spend most of his day working with his project instead. To bring people like you and me, Amazing hardware and software. 

Alot of people dont know this, but the hardware isnt very unique. The software Ben wrote however, is very sophisticated and has been approached by many companies in order to lock future developments down. Ben has turned down every offer because he belives that the project should be avaible to everyone. So in my personal opinion, donating to anyone but Ben is an absolute insult with the years of work he has put in. If others want to help develop and improve. Thats fine. But it has to be done in a good way, making a separate verision that is based on 95% of the original code is not the way to do this. Especially not on new releases. 

If Frank can provide a bridge between Ben and others in a sufficient way, it would be very dumb to not consider it. After all, we all just want to ride some boards. Don't we?.

Well I agree with @linsus and @notger ! Both posts are valid in their own ways.... I would love to have Benjamin implement @Ackmaniac fixes/upgrades/ideas in firmware and Vesc Tool. I totally understand that it takes a lot of time for Benjamin, and itâs har to catch up having full time job, for this reason a lot of us go with @Ackmaniac versions of Tool and Firmware at it comes out quicker and has the features we all want to have. Perhaps somewhere in near future Benjamin can add those features to his work, but since it will take a lot of time we will enjoy @Ackmaniac work. 

@linsus is right - we all should do our best to donate to Benjamin and it honesty most of the code is his.

You only look at the emerged part of the iceberg.
If Benjamin had to answer every email, every forum post, every whatever, you would still be waiting for a lonnnng time before enjoying FOC. ;)
Adding a new feature by a pull request is as simply as clicking on a button.
Instead, dealing with dropbox folders (when sources are available) is a pain and consumes time and... wait... oh shit, no more time to answer questions. :slight_smile:  Endless loop.

Forking the project like still kills the Open Source spirit IMO.

I heard i mentioned before.. but it keeps just getting glossed over so i'm going to mention it again. 

BLDC-Tool is is great. VESC is amazing. It was designed to be a motor controller for esk8s but it has turned into a motor controller for Every Goddamned Thing including Sumo Bots and Power Wheels races. Which is awesome. 

But While BLDC Tool and the vanilla firmware is accommodating Every Goddamned Thing, Ackmaniac's is trying to specifically accomodate esk8s with the needs we have right now specifically for esk8s. 

Not to take anything from Ben or Trampa or anyone else working thier asses off on this, but that is precisely the kind of thing that causes forking and its not like we didn't all see it coming.

As you may have noticed, the old Server has issues and needs to be replaced with a new one. That takes time...

Simultaneously there needs to be structure set up for the community to interact in a structured way.
You need to consider that VESC-Tool is set up in a very structured way, so that changes can be made faster.
The goal is to implement updates faster and allow developers to better understand the code base.
In consequence code contributions can be implemented faster.
This was done to allow more contributions, not to fork faster.

I talked to many people with code skills in person earlier this year and asked them to join in and work closer to the project or help out once the project is live. Instead of that we see the current situation, where Benjamin does tons of coding (two years of hard work) for the good of the community to see a forked version just months after the release. 

In the end a day has 24 hours and code contributions need to be reviewed and changed to fit in perfectly. That is a process taking some time. The benefit is a better code base in the end and more compatibility, a consistent documentation and many more.

We are just 2 months away from the release! Priority A is improving the server, set up a structure for contributions and **bang on hardware releases** while adding in new features for the VESC-Tool simultaneously. Give it some time! Rome wasn't build in a day. Now we face the situation that Benjamin will need to implement the features you are so desperate for, instead of finishing the public hardware release. 
It can't be done all at once. But it will happen faster if more people are willing to contribute rather than shooting ahead with their own versions and ideas. In the end users want a version with all the features available they dream of. They want the hardware and code. But it all needs to fit together, code wise and time wise.

Imagine there is a completely new way to manage the power distribution, a lot more user specific and convenient to deal with. In consequence it would make sense to implement that over the modes that we know already. Unfortunately this would affect many sections in the app settings, like throttle curves, timout ramping etc. In consequence you bang on that new mode first and adapt the other settings later.  A, B, C >> clean result

Such things can be implemented faster if everyone knows how to approach this, know A and B and C and skills are coordinated to achieve it. Currently Benjamin bangs on stuff like that and will implement it and Nico has to start all over again and adapt his fork to the new code and in consequence he has tons of work that he could have invested more efficiently if he worked on the original code base in the first place. 

The current situation also makes it less likely that Benjamin will publish his coding schedule, since he would need to fear that forks will try to implement things faster to stitch him out. That is not good for the community and and collaborative approach we all envision.  

OS-Projects live from collaboration and not from coexistence.

Im just gonna say this...In large projects, forks happen, there's nothing you can do about it unless you move from open-source.  It may not be palatable to you but its a fact of life.  I would further suggest, this specific fork happened because the original project is not meeting the needs of a lot of people.  

The VESC6 is too far reaching, trying to use the same hardware and software for multiple platforms is unlikely to be successful, there are many examples of this, 1 of which is the COMTEL LCD extravaganza of the early 2000's.  COMTEL bought 9 of the 12 manufacturing facilities in the world that made LCD's.  That left COMTEL and Samsung as the only manufacturers.  COMTEL then reduced the form factors from hundreds of options to 5, the login being manufacturers will buy what we choose to sell.  In the end Samsung made billions and COMTEL went bankrupt, because they kept making 100's of different form factors.

I totally disagree.  I don't think the VESC6 has been to terribly good for the community, at least I havent seen it make any huge advance in available options.  I personally cant do anything with a VESC6 that I cant do with a FOCBox/TB Vesc.  The @Ackmaniac firmware has definitely been a help to thousands of users.

Sorry i really don't get it.

Is Benjamin or you Doubting that Nico does his work in a good way, or why are you not just thankful and happy that great work has been done by him.
Probably it has something to do with "Coders-Pride" who did what first, and who did it cleaner.
I don know how @Ackmaniac is looking at it. But Ben could just take Nicos changes, look over them change them if needed and add them to his "Vesc-Tool".

And where is the Open-Source-Spirit if one Person in this case Ben or You? have to "bless" what other people want to have in addition.

It must be terribly difficult trying to balance all of that out, and i can understand the frustration. 

And at this point we're dealing with a process similar to evolution, and the first most organized species out of the sludge may or may not be the survivor of that system. That also has to be frustrating, potentially infuriating. Like when a co-worker steals your spreadsheet and adds a few macros and makes the boss happy. The good news is that the work is done and everyone in the cubicle farm knows who did it. The bad news is that the boss doesn't care who hands it in and has zero loyalty to anything other than his own immediate interest. In this situation, the overall esk8 community is the boss, and they don't care who shows up with the best firmware or where it came from or who's blood and sweat went into it. 

Darwinian competition is ruthless and cold, but it is a very predictable animal. But you know all of this already.

@trampa forking is good. Forking is amazing. Developers like it. A lot of open source projects have "Fork me on GitHub" ribbon on the website, this is a good thing! Truth is you can not submit a pull request without doing a fork first. Forking does not mean "not working together".

@Ackmaniac whether you prefer to contribute upstream or not is totally up to you. I can understand if you were dissapointed by one of your pull request being rejected. This happens sometimes. Doesn't mean it's your fault. There can actually be other people who have time to take your code and create a pull request. Or this can be Benjamin himself. One thing that sucks though is that you did not want to share the code despite GPL license. It took multiple attempts and a rant from @Vanarian (thanks, man!) to make this happen, but the attitude is clear. We have been presented with a zip file. It's like spit-in-the-face way of sharing (from the software engineer point of view). Technically this is OK, but doesn't feel good.

My advice would be to put the code on GitHub, make a quick pull request and then walk away with clean hands. I wouldn't stress to much if it gets accepted or not. Other people might be willing to tweak it and shape it until the point it gets in. And you will avoid ranting ;)

Thank you for implementing new features, I am happy to see people excited about them! That's the most important thing after all! :heart:

nah, thats what branches are for.

technicaly a fork a spearation of the original project which is agoing a different path.
i do understand why they dont like forks, since forks make it pretty hard to be merged again in a later state.

however, if you have many contributors to a project, this usualy also requires a lot of work or "trust". if its a open source project and you planed a specific way allready, then managing those can be rather chalanging. 

i do get why they might be pissed about a fork, but if they dont have documented guidlines and the capacity to manage incoming pull request, then a fork is the natural way.

Sure you need to do a git branch to make pull request, but then the developer can see all changes and the difference in code with ease. The drop box folder we see has no .git folder which makes it hard to see all the changes that have been made. Anyone interested in sharing and enhancing the code should not set hurdles to others. 
Currently there is a "blanket" over the code changes that can only be lifted with a lot of additional effort.
So that is what @rpasichnyk refers to when he says "spit-in-the-face" 

Benjamin can implement stuff without the need of the source, but others might want to look what the difference in code is without the need to manually compare code pages. 

Anyone interested in working on the VESC-Tool anf FW code should use github!

I don't like forks, this can get very messy and cause incompatibilities in the future but

Ben and Ack are heading in different directions, a great idealic VESC-Tool that doesn't solve the problems of the esk8-people isn't very helpfull and I see no way Ben is adding all the esk8-specific features in his software ever, this is not the way he wants to go. Even the VESC6 is overkill for esk8 imho, you can do about the same things with a smaller Focbox.

I think a good esk8-fork of the great VESC-do-everything-software(and hardware) is inevitable to get best results for the esk8-communty.

Everyone should Donate Ben and Ack ;)

How does one make a pull request ? Genuine noob question here. 

@Pimousse @rpasichnyk thank you for your understanding guys. I'm less angry tonight, my head cooled down haha maybe a good time to compile those sources :wink: 

@ackmaniac definitely produces quality work on this project and it must have taken lot of time. Apart from the time & discussion it takes to add a feature, I can understand why Ben might be uptight to add something totally different though.

I mean : it's his baby. It is O-S and he's been at it during his free time for few years now. Realize the sacrifice. Give him some space to breathe, he has his own schedule to make the project grow, specially since it went from "esk8" target to "everywhere".

Anyway here is a proposition which should have been done already ?

- Make an official pull request of the mods
- Fork it too so current code is accessible while waiting for everything to be merged

Ben can easily follow development this way and we still get early access to the new working features while he focuses on his job.

Using @Ackmaniac's flavor of Vedder's software is the single best improvement I have made to my esk8s.  I applaud both Ben and Nico as my equipment wouldn't be the same without their cumulative contributions.  I owe you both.  

I hope that in the spirit of Open Source, more time is spent focused on development, and less on a quest for control.  

I appreciate that this is job for Ben and a hobby Nico.  

I think there may be a lot of us that are buying from Trampa as a way to support Ben at his new job.  In doing this we have a high expectation of his/Trampa's work.  We are buying a finished product, and I think Trampa's products are pretty polished. As such I spent $$$ on an Urban carver.  

However, I fully admit that I would not have spent any $$$ with Trampa (or anyone else)  if it weren't for Nico's software and his presence on the forum. He answered my noob questions and added software features when I asked him for help.  Pretty amazing service from him as a random stranger on the internet.  I owe you man.

So I hope that Ben and Trampa can keep an open mind about @Ackmaniac's fork.  In my case, it helped them sell an Urban carver and future Vesc's. 

And somehow @Ackmaniac has been stuck doing their customer service for free.   (In my case anyway)

I know ben personally and I have to say hes one of the brightest and most humble persons I've ever met. I understand your reasoning around the "baby" scenario. But frankly I'm sure Ben would be positive to the idea to get more developers involved. Aslong as it does not potentially harm the project in the future. Cause who will be misscredited if not Ben when someones VESC blows up due to software collisions etc? (I know its the users own fault but the avrage guy wont see it that way)

And as some has already mentioned, this is his sparetime project. He has a fulltime job and working on his Ph.d. in parallell to this so hearing everyones opinions and doing quick changes is something that hasn't been possible for him. Breaking his leg in combination to the release of the new VESC didn't improve the situation either. 
I also know from Ben that he has felt discourages to continue working with the VESC several times cause there are so many factors sucking the fun out from what he loves with this project. Lets not let this add to that pile.

I'm all for people like ackamaniac implementing changes and investing thier own time to push the project forward. But I really think it is important to implement this in a good way. I really think breaching that gap is something frank can help with.

Amazing work @Ackmaniac, been running your old BLDC tool with your android app, and it great to keep track of board stats and change config on the fly.

I have just updated to this new tool and setup in FOC for the first time, running sweet!

My only problem is that the Android app has now stopped working, I updated the firmware to the default from the app (FW3.1, HW410).

Is there something I am missing or does the new firmware just not work with the current Android app?

Ah ok, that seems obvious now :sob:

Just went for another spin on FOC on my FOCBOX setup, and the board seems to be having a few issues, that nearly took me out. It seems to happen at random but throttle / brake getting stuck on full for like a second, seems like some kind of time out. Also on other occasions vesc seemed to lose connection, like it was resetting. Plugged it into computer when I got home, but no errors??? I know its a bit vague, but any ideas? think I might have to put it back into BLDC on the VESC-tool and test.

On a side note, this only started since the battery has gone down to about 30%, could this be a voltage sag issue??

**Please update to the new file.** (OSX version isn't updated yet, will add it when available)

I just worked the last 2 days on the timeout ramping for PPM. And now it is working like it should. I highly recommend to update to the latest file i released in my dropbox link. The name is the same but the firmware files which are included are different. Also the Version is still the same (3.100)

If 3.100 is already installed you can update easily by connecting to your ESC, read the settings of the app and the motor and then flash it with the new firmware. After the flash connect to the ESC and directly write the settings which you have read previously. This is possible because the parameters did not change. Do **not** close the ACKMANIAC-ESC Tool in between. If you have a slave repeat the steps for it.

When you think that you have correctly adjusted the timeout parameters (instructions in the first post) you can test it by spinning the motors with the remote and simply switch off the remote. Now the ESC. should start to brake. When this works then you can test it at slow speed when you stand on the board. Simply switch off the remote and you should feel that the ESC smoothly ramps to the adjusted brake current.

I have the settings like in the picture below.

Appreciate all your hard work!  I have to ask though... What's the advantage of not updating the version number to, say, 3.101 to reflect the revisions?

Reminds me of when the current ramp step bug was discovered, and Ben Vedder fixed it but kept the firmware at 2.18, making it impossible to tell if you had the bugged version without loading it

When you update the parameters via the ESC-Tool then no. So you need to setup each motor individually.
When you do the update via my app then all motors which are connected by can (and send their status) are updated.

```
Just made some tests with the timeout behavior for PPM and with my Mini remote i set the Timeout to **100 ms**.
By this the ESC reacts very fast if a timeout happens and slowly ramps down. If you let this at 1000 ms (default) the ESC will continue for at least 1 Second with the last command. If this was full throttle there is a good chance that the board will throw you off. 

Sadly the timeout happens most of the time in such a situation. And here is why:
To my experience the reason for a timeout with a PPM remote is mostly a broken antenna on the receiver. This happens during assembling or when we make maintenance in our battery enclosure. Because that cable is always in the way.

So when it is already broken then it sometimes has contact and when it moves a little then not anymore. Or with higher amps comes more interference and that causes the connection loss.
So long story short. It mostly happens when we don't need it (strong acceleration or braking).
And in these situations it is a very high chance for a crash if the board looses the power immediately or if it continues to do full throttle or brake while we released the trigger already. People who had these problems already know what i am talking about.

So with the mini remote i set the timeout to 100 ms so that the trigger doesn't stay at full throttle and reacts really fast.

Please only do this with this firmware and with the latest version. And read the instructions in the first post and test it that the timeout really works with the **correct Failsafe signal**. Please only use a Timeout Brake current if you really understand everything and tested it properly. 
If you don't understand it or your not sure that you set it up correctly then leave it at 0.00 A.

I know that it is a bit complicated but i saw people crash badly because of connection losses. When it is setup correct it is a great safety feature.

Yes you are able to set that but it has no effect. Braking was limited by the max amp parameter. So brakes could be weaker or equal but not stronger.

I've so far tried my new build with 2.18 BLDC and this weekend I'll update to 3.100 and switch to FOC (on focboxes). Hope the braking behaviour doesn't change as I'm pretty happy with the brake force (I only run -8A battery min and -36A motor min / vesc but i find my brakes are good).

Ackmaniac, what can cause drv error message. Didn't notice anything while riding, wasn't riding to hard and everything seems to be working fine now. Running dual focbox, 6355, 12s

This thread looks relevant:
http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/vesc-abs-over-current/19426

Appears you have a really high negative current which I think indicates you used the brakes somewhat hard at some point and it peaked over some absolute max value.  Probably nothing to worry about you can set your absolute max higher to avoid the error I think but I don't think it's really a problem so long as the battery and motor max are set at limits that keep those components safe, the absolute max seems to just be a catch all.

DRV errors are never good. Usually they happen a couple of times again and then your drive gets fried. The over current fault that you get us another story. Sadly in you screenshot the details of that error are not visible. Just tell us your motor, battery and absolue max.
And if you gut the DRV error in FOC you can try to raise the switching frequency to 30000 and hope that it is gone.

@Ackmaniac thanks for your help so far, you've been a real pillar for this community. If I may,  I need to trouble you...

Board rides amazingly well and have 1,500+ miles but todayon the second leg of a ride my board jerked a little after 50m ir did so again almosy throwing me off.

I waited a bit then went home (about 1.5miles) at normal cruising speed and hit 30mph and there were no issues till I saw these at the bottom of the screen when I got home...

Think I found the issue. Soldering joints was bent because the wires were too long and it was all too tight in my bakong tray of an enclosure. Vibrations eventually caused it to short after so many miles.

The XT-90s connects to the VESC with the ground wire connecting to a female XT-90s for the loop key.

Given that there's a DRV8032 fault code, should I look to get a new VESC despite it getting me home safely? 

Obviously I'll be making new, shorter connections and do a better job of soldering either way.

Trying to set the failsafe for my GT2B remote, but the poti only adjusts maximum to about +125% or -120% with full throttle or full brake. 

Having set the failsafe signal to the +125% value and then loosing connection, the VESC does not interpret this as if signal is lost and instead it goes into full throttle. :fearful:

Is there any way to use this new function of smooth braking even on the GT2B?

Ok. The PPM pulselength mapping reads "ESC tool +145%" and "from ESC +100%" when remote is switched off. Nothing one can do about this then I guess.. Too bad as it sounds like a great feature.

Edit; Tweaked the knobs and buttons and a few reboots later it works; +175% is ignored by the VESC. Setting-wise everything is the same as before and so are the switches and knobs on the remote. Very weird and a bit worrying that same exact settings gives a different reading now.. At least it works right now.

I've found my way into this thread by looking up what the new figures in the vesc-tool mean and how I can make use of them for my usecase.
I've read my way all through the two threads with lots of messages in them throughout the last two days.

Thus being a little bit late to this "party" let me have some words on this.

Working myself for a company that embraced an open community oriented workflow via github ( https://github.com/arangodb/arangodb )
(Comming from a closed source company) I know that working in the public (everybody being able to stalk you) is quiet a difference and one has to get used to it.

And at least from following the discussions in the first thread, after some pushing it seems to me that ackmaniac followed a more frequent source release series.

After havig done a PR to the vesc myself to make it a little bit more modular ( github.com/vedderb/bldc/pull/28 )
which hopefully will help it become better adoptable to multiple purposes - since my purposes isn't esk8s either.
Speaking of my PR, I'd like to direct at @trampa - it ended up in a mega-commit - github.com/vedderb/bldc/commit/f14115735812938ccd6142bbdcb7e1799c83d69a -
"Showing with 3,500 additions and 477 deletions" whithout feedback to the original PR on the actual release happening;
which I'd consider at least non well behaved or even as rude as others named the way Ackmaniac treated vedders source as well.

I think as percevied from the community (at least for me) Vedder went off into the closet to get a shiny new version with nice features readily available to the community
as it was polished until it was "presenteable" to a broader audience. As I've learned in this thread a broken leg pushed these timelines even more -
I hope vedder that you recovered good from that. We were presented the outcome of these 8 months in a singe git commit to the VESC firmware repository, and a shiny new UI.
While its debateable to work out something until its presenteable, that single commit doesn't attribute 3rd party contributions and stops every community member from having a look at the discrete steps of this development
so that we can learn from these steps. It really voids the open source pragma "release early, release often" 

Similar things can be said about the way Ackmaniac worked with his tremendous efforts in these two threads in the last one and a half year. While you developed nice
features very usefull to the community that use them, you've denied access to your insights you gained with these efforts to your fellow developers,
as I'd like to call vedder and i.e. me now.
If the truck-run-over-factor kicks in, you're leaving us a little less the way alone as the keyboard hacking community experienced with its valuable member Soarer suddenly disappearing:
https://deskthority.net/workshop-f7/xt-at-ps2-terminal-to-usb-converter-with-nkro-t2510.html without a single line of source.

Please Ackmaniac alter your workflow a little to embrace the way git (and gihtub) works. You simply need to push that work that far away from you so others can grab it easily and do it for you - no discussing or wasting of your precious time involved.

The regular github workflow works like this:
 - log into the github.com webpage with your account
 - head over to i.e. github.com/vedderb/bldc/
 - In the upper right you have the "fork" icon - press it.
 - This will create a fork of the offficial firmware repo on your github account - github.com/Ackmaniac/bldc
 - This is now a full featured fork, that can have all features the other repo has.
 - Clone this to your local harddrive using ` git clone github.com/Ackmaniac/bldc.git `
 - this gives you all current changes the local upstream firmware has.
 - You now work with this repo, develop, debug, and once you've found a thing to change, share your wisdom with us:
  - `git commit comm_can.c someotherfile.c -m "I've changed this for the faith of .... " `
  - `git push `
 -  (you may add all your current changes in an initial commit if you want to avoid the work of splitting it into discrete units)
 - now github.com/Ackmaniac/bldc will contain this special change in one commit.
 - once you've done a set of changes, you'd add a tag as others questioned vedder to do here github.com/vedderb/bldc/issues/31
 - I'd suggest you choose a versioning sheme that doesn't increase the vedder versioning, but appends your own version, so everyone can see this is the vedder-base xyz plus your changes:
   - `git tag v3.xxx-Ack-007; git push --tags`
 - now everyone can see the steps of your work leading to a release, and whats actually contained in a release.

Now s.b. else could see - whew - cool Ackmaniac added something we should have in the vedder repo. Lets say this person is me. 

so I'd have my own fork of the vedder repo on github (github.com/dothebart/bldc) which I've cloned to my local repo, which is my current working directory

$ git clone github.com/dothebart/bldc.git
$ cd bldc
### Now I will add the vedder repo to my workingcopy: 
$ git remote add upstream github.com/vedderb/bldc
### and yours:
$ git remote add ackmaniac github.com/Ackmaniac/bldc
### Now I would checkout your stage: 
$ git checkout ackmaniac/master
$ git pull
$ git log --stat
### would show me your commits. I can now cherry-pick them
### I will checkout vedders stage: 
$ git checkout upstream/master 
Previous HEAD position was 1655c11... Merge pull request #19 from pelrun/master
HEAD is now at 47c0826... Fixed CAN baudrate update
### I now branch a PR branch which will go to my dothebart repo:
git branch feature/add_ackmaniac_feature_xyz
git cherry-pick <git commit hash from log>
< fix eventual conflicts by editing >
git commit # now saves _your_ commit with my adjustments with a note that it was your commits with my edits
### I eventually will have to do more changes to make it work, I will `git commit` them... 
git push # will tell me the magic spell to create this branch on github.com/dothebart/bldc

now once I open github.com/dothebart/bldc I will get a popup, " do you want to create a PR to vedder? " I click yes, fill in stuff etc.
Hopefully vedder will get used to the github workflow, discuss on the issue, me changing stuff as requested, he will merge it.
=> your change merged upstream without you having additional effort or to discuss your work.

I hope that opposed to growing a living user community (that i.e. definitely exists around your fork) we also (as @trampa already tried to express) can grow
a lively developer community around the vesc and its ecosystem. I really do think that vedder has to work on his attitude here too, and the code base
of the ecosystem has to evolve in a way that features can grow up in branches (forks), and easily get merged back later on. 

If you need more help about using git or github, feel free to contact me via twitter.com/dothebart , freenode IRC, or phone.
@ackmaniac As you may have found out already I'm native german also, so maybe that could be easier.

That kinda sucks honestly , sure you can research , but if you start researching the wrong shit or missed a part that you werenât suppose to, you can be out of a good $200 or a headache at the least. Just looking back at the CANBUS vs Split debate, if people didnât see the comment where you have to cut ground when splitting (I believe that was the solution to that issue) you were straight lining your VESC6âs to the eventual slaughter (if Iâm not wrong).

For software like this were thereâs a good 2 or 3 similar applications, there really NEEDS to be a quickstep guide or set up guide with a good ELI5 doâs and donâts. 

Iâve read The thread for VESC-Tool , Enertionâs tool , METR, eSkate VESC, and BLDC Thingamagig ( I am seriously bad with names) and I STILL donât understand the difference, advantages, and disadvantages of each application against each other. Once I get to configuring my Focboxes Iâll have to reread each thread and guide cause fuck me if I donât understand the tool more useful for my needs and understanding capacity.

We just need a software comparison between the tools and Iâm kinda surprised there isnât one, especially when each application is being updated constantly which results in one tool being good for this thing at one point and not being the tool you need at another.

Did you run the hall sensor detection and is the minimum pulsewith in the ppm settings correct?
It also can be that the sensor is placed badly which sometimes leads to a well running motor in one direction and a bad running in the opposite direction.

I know a lot of people want that but it doesn't really make sense. If you expect the motor to turn with 50% speed when at 50% throttle then how much % torque should the motor give when the motor is actually at 10% speed.

Probably It's me but with all this different version I got a bit confused about some points. For my build I am using 10s3p 30Q battery, diyeboard hub motors (75Kv, 500W each, rated for 50A continuous current), 2 Maytech vescs  and Nano-X remote. this are my setting for the motors 

![image|690x388](upload://yMAKzS0HXFV6C2QnI20xq5NEvmi.jpg)
PS: I am using @Ackmaniac  ESC tool.

Now my douts:
1- Do you think my setting are ok? motor max, min ecc...
2- I selected current no reverse with brakes and I know it works as watt control mode. During the motor setup wizard I didn't encountered anything where I can set the max watt. Now by looking at the general BLDC configuration I see there is watt limit at the bottom. Could someone please explain me how to do?
3- Is the throttle curve purely experimental or there is a good common starting point?

4- Are the data displayed during the realtime data detection accurated? Because I could get only 20km/h out of them, which is half of what I was aspecting.

Sorry for the questions, I just want to be sure before doing something that I will regret.

Ciao ciao

_1- Do you think my setting are ok? motor max, min eccâ¦_
**Battery Current max regen can be increased. With you battery to at least -6 A but i would go even higher to for example -9A in your case (i know that's higher than the max charge current but it will only do that for a couple of seconds when you brake)**

_2- I selected current no reverse with brakes and I know it works as watt control mode. During the motor setup wizard I didnât encountered anything where I can set the max watt. Now by looking at the general BLDC configuration I see there is watt limit at the bottom. Could someone please explain me how to do?_
**With your battery max setting you are capable of roughly 25A * 36V = 900W. So 2 motors will produce 1800W. But you can also set the value lower if you want. If you want more you also need to increase the battery max because the watts can only be reached if the battery max allows it.**

_3- Is the throttle curve purely experimental or there is a good common starting point?_
**Throttle curve works great. Just give it a try. Try this setup.**

Thank you very very much! Below my thoughts about it:
1- Ok, I will increase it to -6A. As far, as I know it will affect my brake and of course the amount of current I send back to the battery). Is it correct?
2- Perfect so I do not have to set the watt anymore. The battery I use based on real test is capable of 60A costant discharge, I just wanted to be a bit conservative, but if the performance won't be sufficient I will increase it.
3- Great! I will try it out.

Now, I am trying to connect the sensor cable to the vesc. I had to adapt the connection from the motor to the vesc and I can get one motor sensored, while the other one gives me error during the detection. As far as I know what matter are the 5v, Temp and GND correctly placed, while the hall sensors order is not relevant. Is it correct? I see a clear difference in sensored mode, at lower speed the motor starts really smoothly. Thx!

Often it works when you switch the direction of the motor by switching 2 phase wires. That's because of badly placed sensors. If that also doesn't work then the sensors could be broken. Also have one motor where all sensors don't work. Can be testen by checking the voltage at a signal wire of the sensor with a multimeter. Should show 3.3v and 0v depending on the actual magnet position. Just search on YouTube for checking hall sensor signals.

Motor max: 60 
Motor min regen -40
Battery max :32
Battery min (regen): -6
It felt pretty good I would be at 65% throttle and and around 35mph 
After installed I changed up a bit 
Motor max : 65
Motor min regen -45
Battery max :35
Battery min (regen): -6
Now am around 80% throttle and berly around 32mph 
Things that I think are the culprit , I never did the remote test on the new bldc I just transfers those settings feels the same but not sure 
Ran foc detection with wheels on but did the same thing with previous bldc ?

That is because you were using the normal current control.
In my firmware mod current control works like watt control.

In the original firmware the problem is that the board does full power at higher speeds even when you only pull the trigger 50%.
In my firmware 50% trigger only does 50% power.
By this you have more control over the board because you can control the power much better.
I explained this in more detail here

Hi! So at the end I went for BLDC sensorless. Indeed with your throttle curve I see an big improve at low speed (all the test on bench at the moment). I got the Bluetooth today and I install it... The app is crazy! Its possible to set almost everything. Here a screen shoot at max speed. Two question is it normal that I reach 95% of duty at most? Secondly the top speed measured is only 24km/h, is it realist? Thx

You should go to the settings and adjust the Drive Gear Setup to enter the amount of motor magnets, Wheel size (diameter) Wheel pulley teeth and Motor pulley teeth. by that i can calculate the speed. A hint, a normal 6374 motor or 6355 has 14 Magnets.
Duty cycle of 95% is the maximum a VESC with hardware 4.x can reach.
After you created modes you can select them by clicking on the mode box which will open a popup window where you can select one of your modes.

![image|283x376](upload://4H0cMSmMo71clk6QDNkj3Z6DfJI.jpg)
When it shows default then it is the mode which is stored on the VESC. When you want that one of your modes becomes the new default then you have to click long on the mode box and a popup window will appear which asks you to set the currently active mode as the new default.
You can even swith between FOC and BLDC of you made the motor detection for both modes.

So I tried again the mode switch and indeed it's super easy :+1:.
1- During the motor wizard in the ESC Tool the max W was automatically set at 15000 (in order to disable it). Therefore the max watt would be calculated based on the max battery (25A in my case), Is it correct?
2- Now in the app by swithcing modes we can set the max watt that replaces the 15000 default one. For instance in my case 25A *37 = 925w. Is it correct to do that or it's better to leave 15000? In my mind the throttle curve is set based on the max watt so If I choose 15000, the VESC will try to reach 15000 at full throttle meaning it would ask at most 925w already at 6.17% of the throttle curve [(935*100)/15000]. SI it correct? Sorry for all the question but I really like it and I would like to understand it better.
3- I checked for the number of poles, someone said that we have to introduce the number of pair poles ( so half of the total), but in my case if I put 14 is like 72Kmh, with 28 56Kmh and so on... In all the case a get 24Kmh max speed... Not really clear this point.

In this version of the firmware it will be either limited by the current or by the watts. But i recommend to set the battery max to the max your battery or VESC can handle and the watts to finetune the power output. 
So in your case battery max rto 30A (3P * 20A / 2Motors) and then set the watts to whatever you want. So 1080 should be max fpor yoiur battery and 2 Motors. If you want less power simply change the watts. If you want less power at low speeds you should change motor max.

Ah ok now I got it. So basically it takes the limited factor as the max level. It can be either current or watt. Ok I will  do it. My bms has costant discharge current of 60A so probably better to limit a bit the watt to do not run it at the max level, although it will drain 30A just in case of sever hills and not always so it shouldn't be a problem. If I change the parameter in the app does it change it also for the other VESC connect by canbus or do I have to connect the vesc to the vesc tool separately to change the motor max and battery max? Thx you very much.

You have to connect the app to the master. So if your Bluetooth module is connected to the master it is fine. If connected to the slave you can tell the app to connect to the master via CAN.
So when you change settings on the master it automatically updates all slaves over CAN.

My app is connected to the master and the two VESC are connect over CAN so I just need to change it in the app and it will be updated to the slave too. Is it correct? Just as confirmation.
Concerning the measured speed it only reads 24kmh, I hope that it is not the real one, otherwise my setup is crap :joy:

Tested out this firmware today, tested it on a single drive. 
Its smooth and nice def more controllable! 
I do miss some off the aggressiveness but this can be cuz i only tried it with one motor and the last test what with dual.

Im running sensorless but with this fw its like running sensored from a dead stop, its super nice!
Cant wait to test it with dual motors

Hey @Bjork3n , so you are saying that you have stutter free motor from dead stop with ackmaniack fw, with sensorles motors? May i ask, what motor you are using, and what settings ð

Just tested the original vesc fw 3.35 on my board with 2x focbox / sk3 6364 190kv(sensorles), and got at lot of stutter in foc mode from dead stop, almost as much as in bldc mode. Big  disappointment, so i switch back to bldc mode, because i think the responsnes and acceleration/brakes felt better.

Arranged all this to get cruise control and, ironically I got it alone now:
When I pull the trigger mini start in cruise control mode (have to break to decrease speed), steering wheel doesnât work.
Advices?

At the master you need your normal control mode like current control and at the slave you need to select the control mode with cruise. So the opposite of yours.

sorry Ack I changed the photos in order to enhance the quality while you were helping me. Maybe I inverted some photos. But now they are in order. Can you check again?
Because I was sure I had already followed your indications: I set

Master = 0 = "Current no reverse with brakes"
Slave = 1 = "cruise control via slave"

I re-set these value once more to be sure after your comment  and I got a weird behaviour:
just touching the throttle caused the motors to spin at max speed.
Couldn't brake.
I'm clueless

You need to connect Channel 1 to the slave vesc and not channel 3. 
Just a tip, set a high deadband like 50% for the slave so that cruise really only activates when the wheel is turned a lot. 

By the way, to all Vesc 6 owners. Don't use the ppm cruise function because it can brake your ppm pins. Focbox and other which are based on Vesc 4 hardware seems to be fine.

Sorry if this was already asked. But I couldnât find it. 

I finally got to the point of this build to program the FocBoxes. Everything went well until I realized the motors were going on the wrong direction. I went to swap the phase wires and the motor just seem to cog. I guess itâs becuase of the hall sensors?

**I know thereâs a reverse motor direction function but can find it!** 

Iâm running FOC if that makes a difference.

@b264 is right. If you are running for it hybrid you need to redo the detection without wheels mounted for it to be ultra accurate. With bldc it doesn't matter if you switch phase wires assuming there's no obstructions in the can.

Need some help with braking in FOC.

I flashed my 4.12 VescÂ´s with the latest 3.100 firmware and did setup FOC sensorless for both VescÂ´s and motors.
I am using the Nano remote and the VescÂ´s are connected via Canbus, both motors are spinning after a slight push and acceleration is just fine and smooth. In PPM i have set current with no reverse and braking. And my remotes signal is centered. 
But when braking, i just get strong braking for a split second and after that the board coastÂ´s and brakes in a rhythmical pattern but with no braking force at all, i donÂ´t know how to describe it, itÂ´s like a kind of cogging.
I played with battery min. regen. and lowered it down to -7 to no avail.
Sometimes when i accelerate just for a short time the braking works as expected, but if the speed drops beyond a certain amount the board startÂ´s coasting again. When I accelerate to a higher speed the brakes will disengage immediately. This kind of cogging, or whatever i should call it, happens through all the throw of my remote, so the Vesc seems to recieve the signal properly.
Running the same setup in BLDC works just fine.
I hope someone can enlighten me, i really want that silent FOC to be running.
Here in Japan people are jelling and swearing at me because of the noise running BLDC.

_**NEW ACKMANIAC_TOOL 3.101**_

Just released the new **Version 3.101** of the **Ackmaniac-Tool** which includes the latest changes of Benjamin Vedders original firmware and fixes 2 important issues.

1. By another thread i realized that one of the motors stopped braking when the maximum speed is exceeded like one user reported. This also caused the problem that dual motors did brake uneven when connected by CAN and motor min and motor max had different values. 
With the new firmware you will realize that the brakes feel less strong but you can simply adjust that by increasing the motor min value. Because now they brake with the same power.

2. And the other problem was that the brakes disabled themself when the start of the mosfet or motor temperature was reached. 

Both issues came from the original firmware and i addressed the second problem already in the official VESC forum. The first problem came also from the original firmware but Benjamin never used the function that caused the issues.

Another minor issue is also fixed which let the slave motor brake when you try to enable cruise control while driving backwards (guess nobody noticed that).

I recommend to update the firmware even if it takes some time to setup everything again. Maybe you should first save the settings with the old Ackmaniac-Tool and then load these settings in the new one. But still double check everything. And test the board properly if everything behaves normal after the update.

PS: I realized that when the master and the slave have both "Send status via CAN" activated and the same "Controller Id" then the slave motor can cut out. So please be careful that the master doesn't have this parameter enabled and to be safe give them a different "Controller Id".

Yes the CAN Baudrate needs to be setup now and should be the same on all ESC. 
I recommend 500K. 
And take care that "Send CAN status" is only activated at the Slave and disabled at the master.
And as there are new messages for the CAN Bus all VESC should have the same firmware. So don't try it with only one updated. just flash both and then do the setup.

He was using a Virtual Machine to be able to use Windows. And he had the live relatime data, app data and heat rate enabled. Seems that that was too much for the serial communication so that some of the reads and writes didn't work. After disabling of all the live data it worked without issues.
So if you use the Windows via a Virtual Machine then you should disable all the live data when you change values.

This might be a stupid question, but if I'd want to have a mode that's using only one motor, would that be possible (and safe for the vesc) by adjusting settings in the app? Like maybe setting batt and motor max to zero but still having it connected and powered on? 

If so, could one use two motors for braking, setting batt and motor min values, but using only one motor for acceleration?

Also one thing I don't understand why it hasn't been integrated in the VESC firmware:  Right now, every time you powercycle the board, the Watt-hour, Amp-hour, and distance data is lost (rezeroed).  To make a useful battery gauge, that data should be stored in non-volatile EEPROM (on the VESC ST Microcontroller), and only rezeroed either via the app or whenever the voltage of the battery gets above let's say 41.0V (for 10S pack), which indicates that the board has been recharged (just like when you rezero your trip odometer on your car after filling your tank with gas).  Please try to implement this in the VESC firmware and App as it will make the battery gauge a lot more useful.  @Ackmaniac

It is the normal behavior. At slow speed the VESC can't detect the speed of the motor and does a full short when braking. It really depends on your motor at which speed that happens. 
That's the reason some notice it and some not. My firmware mod does the same as the original when it comes o this behavior.
With sensored motors it is much better.
And it also depends on how many cells in series your battery has. Because at braking below 3% duty cycle the VESC will go into that block. And with a 12S battery that happens at 20% higher speed then for a 10S Battery.

Thanks for explanation. I have one more problem (regular firmware), braking related. I tested it on 6S which happened to be safer thing to do. When I go downhill freely and speed is higher than highest speed setup can go and try to break slowly it's rapidly slowing to max speed setup allows. I was lucky that I discovered this while going 30kmh and braking slowed me rapidly to like 26kmh (max with 6S) and I managed to keep myself on a deck. Is this how things work, even on your firmware?

Bad idea. Means it auto brakes at any time while you are accelerating or free coasting. Was like that in the old versions when you accelerated. If you ask me then the components of your system don't fit to your way of riding.
And it's not sure that this was the reason for the broken foot. And it should be addressed in the vesc-project forum. 

But in theory you should not reach higher speeds than your motor can achieve on the bench when it spins freely.
Because the BEMF (voltage of motor) will be higher than the voltage of the Battery and in this case it can only work as a generator which leads to braking. There is physically not much you can do if you ask me.

Okay. I will do some more research on this. Had not given it any thought tbh. I was gunning down hill at almost 50 and my boards top propulsion speed is 46.6 at full battery. Battery was almost empty at 3.1V

If nothing can be done about this, it should be made super well known to all eskate builders. I also think auto braking is a bad idea. I would prefer completely deactivating braking to just locking the wheels.

Edit: Actually really smooth auto braking to limit your downhill speed to max motor speed would be perfect now that I think about it.

When I mentioned autobraking I meant that you cannot go higher than vesc max RPM which should be rather easily implemented as VESC is constantly monitoring motor position through BEMF it should be possible to detect when wheel rotation count is approaching highest for configured voltage and not allow to go beyond that speed by engaging braking with deceleration curve twice or triple times as long as acceleration one (2-3 times less steep). We wouldn't even need place to add wheel diameter or gearing ratio to calculate real speed as it would only need max motor RPM count for selected battery voltage.

Can't you do that by keeping your throttle engaged?

[quote="chaka, post:20, topic:35005"]
The question about overrunning the ERPM is a good one, you have to be carefull with that. One thing I do is keep my throttle fully engaged when hitting my top speed while going downhill. With the throttle engaged as you reach your top electrical speed you will feel the motors produce drag to keep the speed from increasing any further. If you let off the throttle the motors will free wheel and you could overrun the ERPM

still have the problem in 1.91 .. and yes I did change the app setting to "do not optimize" for battery life.  Is that what you wanted me to try?  Basically if the VESC is turned off while the app is open, the app freezes and when you turn the VESC back on, it doesn't recover. you need to kill the app and open it again, which is obviously not ideal

Yes, I agree, in theory this shouldn't happen, but if you have hills or a long slope and don't Monitor your Speed constantly.. you should be able to rely on your breaks to slow you down .. But this should maybe go into the vesc forum..

Does it happen in the firmware in 2.18? because that's what i'm using on production boards still. 

@jayx is running version 3.x on his 13S build. Maybe he can chime in here since he keeps blowing shit up and streeting his face. I'm too old for that shit, and most of my customers are total noobs or don't understand any kind of unexpected weirdness.

@koralle depends on your set up. If I did that I would be leaving red skidmarks on the pavements. In BLDC mode it never happens. But it happens very often in some of my FOC set ups.

Thanks guys. I'm familiar with VESCs and the previous version of the tool but this is my first time with focbox and this new tool. 

Does motor detection need to be totally smooth? When I put in detection config values from the old tool (6.0a, 600erpm, 0.05), I get successful detection but the second part of detection sounds rough. I've never seen detection sound like that. On stock firmware with the stock tool and the phase wires plugged into the same motor wires, everything is super smooth.

Try to switch 2 phase wires so that the motor runs in the other direction. Then do the detection again. If that also doesn't work you should check the sensors via Multimeter. And also check the wires if they are at the right pins. But i also have a sensored motor that doesn't work. Checked it with multimeter and the sensors show always the "HIGH" state. On other motors BLDC mode has trouble when the sensors are slightly off.

You can also try to detect them in FOC mode which mostly works better than BLDC. The esk8 ESC shouldn't have isuses in FOC. On once you go FOC you won't go back.

Had a look at Scramboards website and it seems that they sell maytech VESC. In this case you can upload the bootloader via the tool and then firmware updates should work. 
To use these VESC in a mountainboard isn't really a smart idea because of FOC problems at the high amps that are needed. In BLDC they should work but you will get Temperature issues.

I have some motors that behave this way. I verified halls with a oscope, and tried every combination of phase wires. Won't detect in BLDC mode.

I have some other motors that very rarely would detect in bldc mode, but one time on the road the motors would not spin. Switched to sensorless and all is well.

And I had an incident where one of my phase wires broke and I ended up frying the vesc.

Riding sensorless now and I don't miss it.

I have noticed that the evolve style motors have very weak hall sensor outputs.  The VESC uses 2.2 kOhm Pullup resistors, which is typical but too strong for some hall sensors, causing a hall sensor low output to actually look high.  For a low to be read as a low, it typically has to be less than 0.6V (on a 3.3V system).  For those types of motors, either run sensorless, or hybrid and you should be ok.

When you want to run in sensored, watch how your motor behaves during detection. If it spins up fine at first, then stutters at the end, rise the duty higher until it works.
Play a bit with the detection values. It should work if you play around a bit.
Sometimes it helps if you just reconnect everything new and restart the vesc.

If you want, post a video of the failed detection and we try to help you out what you can change to make it work.

I mostly get them to work, but i also had a few that doesnÂ´t, no matter what i tried :neutral_face:

I'm having issues trying to connect vesc monitor to all my boards via hm10  since last update, is there anything I missed, didn't want to open the enclosures.

@ackmaniac on a previous post you said it was too difficult to detect the correct ERPM when the motors were spinning at almost dead stops, so the motors went into full brake throwing you forward. Would it possible to never go into full brake by instructing the ESC to a constant value of 1km/hr when the ERPM reads zero, so it doesn't go into full brake?

I understand your idea but that won't work. Issue is that the VESC looses tracking of the motor. You can force the motor to roll with exactly 1km/h. But if the Motor isn't at exactly that speed then you have the same stutter like at start up with a sensorless motor.

I am using current control with reverse (hybrid sensored). actually I realize what's happening.  When you roll backwards and try to accelerate forward, it actually brakes.  so the only way to get going forward again is to kick push and then accelerate.  it would be nice if below a certain speed, it would actually try to accelerate and not brake. otherwise you have to kick-push to get going..

Also, I could be wrong, but it seems like on the latest  version of VESC Monitor (v1.94), when trying to switch to FOC, it doesn't actually switch.  Can you check this? Also, it would be nice if the app actually shows whether you are in BLDC of FOC mode.  Right now, you can't be sure

I notice a difference in breaking with this firmware since changing from 3.100 to 3.101. 

On 3.100, breaking was only very strong at low speeds, never at higher speeds. 

Now though on 3.101, when I first start riding, I get *very* strong breaks at all speeds. This can be a little crazy going 30+ and having such sensitive breaks. I almost feel like I should be worried I am overloading things, but checking the logs, I am not sending more amps back to the battery than I have set. Oddly enough though, once the board gets warmed up a bit, the breaking sensitivity calms down to a much more manageable level at high speeds, but it remains still quite strong at slower speeds. Usually only 5-10% of my ride is spent during that "warm-up" period where breaks are super sensitive.

I don't know if this is a quirk with my setup, the firmware, or if this is how this is supposed to be... but I can live with it for sure- I kind-of like it, and now I have a reason to adjust my breaking curves.

On 3.101 the brake for the slave motor was fixed so that it brakes at the same amount as the master. Depends on your previous settings how much the difference is but now with 3.101 it brakes equal. Of course it is important that you have the same settings on master and slave. If you want your brakes a bit weaker at high speeds then reduce your batter min (regen).
And if the brake force is too strong in total you should reduce the motor min.

_increase_ the battery minimum

So, like for example "-25" to "-20"

Hi! I just finished remake my enclosure (fiberglass) and I took the oppurtunity to upload to 3.101 firmware during the process. I used the same parameter as before, but this morning I noticed that when I go full throttle on the fast mode (Nano-x remote) the board loses power for one second. I din't have it this problem before, never had a single drop of signal or power. If I ride in the low speed mode that won't happen. It's sound like some current or watt limit reached but by the chart I am far away from the limit, moreover I never had in the past 1 month and a half that I used the board.
Do you know what It could be? It's quite scary! Thx a lot

**Just released the new Version 3.102:**
- Fixed bug where motor did spin backwards when motor max is lower than motor min.
- Cruise control now takes latest motor amps to start the PID controller instead of starting from zero. 
This way cruise control starts extremely smooth when you accelerate up a hill (or at braking (only NRF)). If you did hold a constant speed uphill before activating cruise control you won't even recognize that it became active. Old behavior always started form 0 and tried to balance the speed. But till you got there you lost already a lot of speed uphill. This way the PID controller could be set up less responsive so that it is even smoother at carving.
- Small change for start of sensorless openloop to take latest detected position instead of position of last calculation. (guess it's not recognizable)

A easy way to update is to following:
- connect to the ESC
- read motor congig
- read app config
- update the firmware
- connect again after 10 seconds
- write motor config
- write app config

then do the same for the slave if it exists. It is important that you don't close the application in between.
or you can save the config via the menu in a xml file and the read it again after you flashed the firmware.

Should work. Don't use the Cruise via secondary channel for PPM remotes with the VESC 6 (2nd channel connected to slave to give the Cruise control command). Because the ground loops can brake the VESC 6 Hardware. 4.12 Hardware seems to be fine with it. But not many use this feature anyway (I love it).

Soo, I have been trying for some time to get this linux version up and running. 

The normal vesc tool is just a download and then it works, this one however keeps asking for a lot of libraries, mostly from QT.

Since i had a 32bit ubuntu for some legacy reason, i started with getting 64bit debian, then getting QT, then it wanted the newest 2.27 libc thats not in stable in debian so i switched the sources to buster, the testing branch. then it's wanting some plugin, xkc? xkb? Was going about looking for that one when i also was running an upgrade to the buster repo and somehow the installation got messed up so i had to start over. So i feel pretty done with messing with that, any thoughts on this? I was thinking maybe i'll just try compiling it myself

Update: So testing @b264 version i got the same results, could start it without problem but got  "QMetaObject::connectSlotsByName: No matching signal for on_actionESCToolChangelog_triggered()
QObject::connect: No such signal Commands::nrfPairingRes(int)
QObject::connect:  (receiver name: 'nrfPair')
Segmentationfault" on trying to connect.

So i started with nothing and i got most of it left!

Update again:
Alright, so i managed to compile it at it all works now! Man i wish that i would have started with this instead haha.. well, hopefully i learned something

Well, here ya go:
https://github.com/skrutt/Ackmaniac-VESC-tool-build

It's a mess for now, but the compiled binary is in the release folder. i really, really, really hate git for "quick uploads"! Fucking melts my brain, just upload the damn files!!

I was looking at a static linked version, i guess thats what the original vesc tool does? since it's so much bigger and does not ask for any files? I think i could do one of those but it's probably not right according to any open source licenses  so i didn't try it.

Edit: If you try it, tell me if it works :) I might try to maintain a somewhat stable linux version since i want one for myself aswell, and sharing that with others is always fun. Should be simpler also to get it working for others than my own luck trying to get it running!

Trying out PID no acceleration... I select the mode from the BT app, but it doesn't seem to change to the mode I select, or at least behave like I would expect PID no acceleration to work... It just works like current mode regardless. Changing modes works otherwise.

Do I need to configure PID mode in ESC Tool before being able to select it in the app?

Once configured (assuming that's why it doesn't work), can I still swap between PID no acceleration and regular current mode in the app?

I looked through the tool, but for now I don't want to change from current to PID no acceleration in ppm tab, since I prefer current control as my primary. I only tried to make the changes in the BT app, to PID no acceleration from current control. 

Since this didn't work, I will mess around with my ppm settings and ppm mapping tomorrow, and see if changing PID no acceleration to my primary and switching to current control in the BT app will work instead of vice versa.

**Edit:**  I just tried changing to PID no acceleration... it's sweet! I'd love the option to change to this on the fly... But changing to current control mode in the app doesn't work, I am stuck with only PID no acceleration- unable to change back to current control. PPM mapping for current control and PID no acceleration seem to be exactly the same in the ESC tool on PC, so any changes there don't have any effect. 

This might have more to do with the ESC Monitor app at this point... I think I may have found an indication of the problem: Inside the top left box in ESC Monitor (the mode box), I am pretty sure it normally indicates what mode you are in- such as current, current no reverse, Duty, PID, PID no Acceleration, or disabled. No matter what I set my modes to in the ESC Monitor app, when I select the modes i've setup (regardless of control mode), the box always just reverts to disabled, while seeming to default to whatever control mode i've set in ESC tool on the PC, while watt limits, amps, etc all take effect just fine. Maybe if I just disable control modes on the computer, the app will allow me to select a control mode? I'll have to try this tomorrow, it's getting late. Regardless, if I remember correctly, I think the ESC Monitor app used to show the control mode type in the mode screen instead of always saying "Disabled" and reverting to the control mode type from ESC tool.

**Edit 2**: Disabling control modes in ESC Tool made no difference, must be the app... going to make a post there with more details.

@skatardude10 Looks like you are connected to the slave via the app. If the module is physically connected to the master then you enabled the option in the app to connect to the slave via CAN.
If the module is physically connected to the slave then you need to enable the option in the app to connect via CAN. 
Ppm mode changes only work for the master while current and watt limits can be overwritten also for the slave.

1: Wait, if slave control mode is set to only uart and takes commands from master (BT connected to master), then why won't changes to control mode  for master work and slave just mirror it since master is just sending data to slave to replicate?

2:  **Solved! It's my nano-x calibration routine!!!**
> I still have the symptom where brakes are very strong starting fresh, regardless of speed to a certain point. If I ride up to higher speed though, everything works as expected. I don't have any issues if I spin my wheels full speed forward and reverse though before hopping on my board. If I spin the wheels full speed both directions, then braking power works as expected. Having the super duper strong brakes symptoms seems 100% linked to how fast the wheels have spun or not since starting up the board. 

3: Have you or anyone here tried using Vedder's vesc tool Android APK to modify firmware settings outside the app? I'm guessing I'd need to flash my HM-10 clone with new firmware for it to even work... I'm wondering if it will ask me to update to the latest VESC tool firmware I stead of your own before making any changes... I'm just trying to think of alternatives to swapping PPM control modes on my setup short of hauling my laptop in my backpack to reprogram it on the road (panel mounted USB on the enclosure is nice, but not *that* nice).

It works via the app. So you did connect the module to the master, right? Then check in the app settings of you activated to connect via CAN. If yes then you need to deactivate it because you are already the master. If you still don't see modes then check if your master sends his status via CAN in the vesc settings? That needs to be deactivated. Only the slave should send it's status. When all of this is setup correct then you will be able to change the control mode via the app.

hi ,ackmaniac yes lot of change for me  there but again another problem occur and when i put my tx off ,the motors start spinning at full trottle and  i don't have failsafe on my rx .  and its to dangerous to ride like that , the time out is set to 1000ms  right now .

I am trying to get a better understanding of when watt-hour data gets rezeroed on the VESC and on the app.  I know that every time the VESC is power cycled, the displayed DISTANCE and WATT-HOUR data on the app are rezeroed. However, I noticed that the estimated remaining RANGE seems to use WATT-HOUR data that is not rezeroed when board is power cycled.  This is a good thing, because obviously you may turn off your board mid-ride and not want to lose that data.

So my questions:
1) When is Watt-hour data actually rezeroed (regardless of what's displayed on the app)?  Is it when battery voltage is let's say about 41.9V (an indication that a 10S battery has been fully charged)?

2) Since the consumed Watt-hour data seems to be saved after powercyling the board (as indicated by remaining range), why are you not displaying this non-zeroed data in the app?  It would be nice if the app showed remaining battery capacity based on remaining Watt-hour (not voltage as it does now which is a lot less accurate). In other words, let's say you define the pack as having 100 Watt-hours in the app, and you have consumed 25 watt-hours, then the app should show that you have 75% battery left.  and this data should not be lost or rezeroed upon powercycling.  The only time that this data should be rezeroed is when battery voltage goes above let's say 41.9V (indicating the battery has been fully charged).

Please consider these changes to the VESC firmware/ app, as it would make the battery gauge a lot more accurate.  Is there any reason this hasn't been implemented already? @Ackmaniac

after rebinding your remote, when you pull the bind plug out of the receiver, it will use that state as the failsafe, so adjust the white knob (labeled TH trim) on the remote and  be sure the motor is not moving or braking, and then pull out the bind plug and this state will be remembered as the failsafe.  you can verify this by turning the remote off and making sure the motor doesn't move or brake.

Yes thanks  l already done it l forgot to reply . for your battery board gauge  if you want a device more accurate device use wattmeter like me and you can disconnect the side load when you want to cut power and the lcd come with a led so its very nice at night also and give perfectly the real amount of mah used of the battery! And watt hour. Time rided . voltage , and only used the ackmaniac app for set my speed or power..![15297344164651060823928|690x388](upload://bSxPjFadpHlA3ML2rAKxm9clMzA.jpg)![20180623_021226|690x388](upload://9YpLdORwLZVVysAfH0P7Yke3VuZ.jpg)

Yes I have used that kind before, but that particular couloumeter also loses all data upon powercycling.  anyway the VESC has the ability to report the same data and why add additional hardware, if the VESC can do it all?  just need to change the firmware/app to report this data.

You are not connected to the master via the app. In the settings of the app you can select if you want to connect via CAN to another vesc. So if the module is connected to the slave you need to connect via CAN to the master. If the module is already connected to the master then disable that checkbox.

An easier approach for him might be to setup an Android build environment for his ESC tool. I might end up doing this just for ttheheck of it. I quit mid setup because I figured out the app could do what I wanted, I just had the wrong settings in the app that prevented me from changing modes. Having the full ESC tool on Android I'd pretty cool, then you can do a TCP connection from there directly to the app via 127.0.0.1 all on the same device, no extra work required besides setting up Android compilation.

Hi, i am having a Problem while breaking downhill and i think it is related to riding faster than my setup is capable. 

I did my Motor setup right and have been riding the board >200km. Running in FOC on a single focbox 10s4p 30Q's // 200kv APS motor //normaly the board tops on ~40km/h fully charged // battery min -15A // bestech BMS charge/discharge 20/80A

I was riding  41km/h downhill and wanted to brake slightly but they were super strong and cut out immediately. I tried it 3 times more and it was the same behavior. After the incident i checked the logs and the battery min was -24,5A

So my question is how is it possible for the vesc to break on -24,5A while the setting was on -15A

Thanks in advance![Screenshot_20180625-213250|281x500](upload://kCrnTT8CV29IAZgzu70WUlSlQcc.png)![Screenshot_20180625-215249|281x500](upload://iKBDPALswj8IZjTMYlgYhqgnxDk.jpg)

Well hard to tell a i see that the first time. Maybe you were going faster than your topspeed you could reach with 95% duty cycle. Could be that the board board acts strange in this situation.
But please also check in the app settings that you didn't accidently st the number of motors to 2.

If you could provoke that situation again and make a video with the app(would be enough when you leave the phone in your pocket). Maybe you can also share your log file to investigate a bit better.

This issue resulted in me breaking my foot a few weeks ago. Still not sure how I can make this more well known among new builders. Posted on the vesc-project forum and ppl said well don't go faster than your boards top speed then. (apparently theres not really a lot to be done) I think a very soft auto braking feature would be nice when you go near and above your top speed. @chaka said you should just continue holding your throttle on 100% then your speed will be limited to your board's max speed even when going downhill. I have not tested this yet because my foot is not fully healed but in the vesc-project forum nobody said it was a bad idea. You are at least the third person reporting this phenomenon so by now I am finally sure I wasn't just imagining things.
I'll post into the wiki at least.

My first thoughts were that the BMS is cutting off but then there should be at least an over voltage/any fault. But the breaks were super strong even on the slightest throttle move...

@Ackmaniac i was certainly faster than 95% duty and number of Motors is set to 1 and here is the [Logfile](https://yoxcu.de/uni/longboard/2018-06-24_14-00-59_Link_esc_Data.csv).
I can try to ride the hill again but only in 2 weeks when i'm home again

I will also try @koralle / @chaka 's hint holding the throttle at 100%

Just had a look at the logs and it happened when you had more than 95% duty cycle. In that moment the vesc tried to apply 95% which resulted in a voltage difference that leaded to the higher brake current.
My advice, change your gearing so that it doesn't happen again.

There's also another option when going downhill, at least the one I prefer. I just keep braking very slightly, just to hear the motor hum, it doesn't do much speed wise but allows me to go around 50kmh (10S, 2,25 ratio on 80mm kegels) and  and still have very smooth brakes. I'm not comfortable to go faster so this method should might only work up to this speed.

As you can see in the picture when instructing the motor to spin "forward" the motor current locks at around 30-35 A. When the motor is instructed to go in reverse, then the motor amps stay consistent with the amps used and continues to increase until over current issues arise. When this happens, reverse feels EXTREMELY POWERFUL, like as if my skateboard had a rocket attached to it (maybe that's how my build is supposed to feel?). I have fixed the overcurrent issue, this issue opened up an error in my foc programming that was fixed. I am still using foc if that could have anything to do with it. Running 12s2p with an Ollin Board Co ESC v1.1.

Any idea is appreciated.

My board is a little slow to accelerrate, so I would love to utilize whatever is happening in reverse.

There is actually a setting in the vesc to counter this, "limit top speed with negative torque" i think it's called. You set the max speed to some value that your board can actually reach and then the vesc will automatically apply the brakes so that you can't go faster that that.

I think so. It goes from approx 1000 to 2000us with 1500 as center. Itâs rideable but I just feel way less secure on the throttle as itâs so brutal both on and off compared to stock firmware. If I move my thumb slowly itâs no problem :D

Firmware is uploaded and showing as 102 I think it was.

Question is if it shows the correct hardware version.
The brakes are more powerful because the software calculates the brake power in a different way. Original firmware does it in a strange way which only makes sense when you set motor min and batter min to the same value. But that doesn't make sense when you haven't got a battery that can handle 60A charge current. 
If it is too strong then just reduce the motor amp values and you can also adjust the throttle curve to your needs.

Ok that makes sense. The breaks is only a good thing really I just need to be aware of it but the throttle was a bit notchy. Will try to play some with the throttle curve and maybe try watt control and see if that makes a difference. 

I donât think anything is wrong itâs just very different :)

Click where it says firmware assuming you have a bootloader you will need to know the hardware version of the board like the torque board vesc and focbox are both 4.12 so you would find the selection for your vesc version and load the default firmware.

I have a problem if I set up my vesc to current mode.
In current mode I can drive forward and backwards.
If I simulate a signal loss by switch of my remote the
break apply and after reaching 4000erpm the wheels start to spin backwards.
How to adjust the settings that in case of signal loss the board will just break or roll out?
My timeout is set to 1000ms and 0A.
I tried it with different remotes. Did fail safe set up of the remote and adjustment in the app settings. So everything should be centered.

When the timeout current is set to 0 then the timeout does nothing else then giving no throttle. Problem is that the remote receivers fail safe sends a valid signal for going backwards. So please check the signal in the tool when the remote is off and adjust it if it is wrong.

You can also adjust the failsafe far away from the normal positions. To do that turn the poti for example completely to the left and then adjust your pulse width settings. After that turn your poti completely to the opposite direction and increase the pulsewith by holding the trigger to go as far away from the normal pulse with signals as possible. Then adjust the failsafe in that position.
Because if the vesc detect a pulsewith that is more than 20% away from the normal positions it detects it as a signal loss.
And for example for 1.00 min, 1.5 center and 2 max 20% away would be below 0.8 or above 2.2. Hope that is understandable.

Still a bit confusing. 
I just donÂ´t get the fail safe signal set to the center position of my pulsewith (min is -11% which still gives a small impulse to the motors).
I donÂ´t understand how to set the failsaife according to your description. I made like this:
1.poti max left 
2.center pulswith with app 
3.poti max right 
4.put the trigger to the max away from pulswith (would be max backwards/break) 
5.switch off vesc plug pairing plug and switch on system in the max trigger position.

I think I got something wrong, as when I do like this the failsaife of the remote is set to 100% break and in current mode it would spin the motors backwards with all they can.

Vedder says at higher speeds the halls signal wouldn't be fast enough. Never tried and it works great sensorless above 2500. For 12S I recommend a higher switching frequency of 30khz which I always use. I experienced that the motors begin to vibrate with 20khz at high speeds. But it depends on the motor. Most people don't recognize that. But when I try their boards I feel it immediately and after I told them they can hear it as well.

@Ackmaniac, what would it involve to create a step-assisted mode (like the slow ebikes) in your firmware? e.g. when the wheels are spinned manually (by a kick) they spin down (assisted) really long (settable by throttle) this is more or less the same as one of the commercial boards but with the difference that it won't keep running that speed forever. as safety feature i would keep the remote control for breaking, the throttle for the amount "support"

update: I See, it is already asked for as endless mode, missed that ;-)

That mode already exists. When you press the throttle it holds the speed and braking still works. It doesn't accelerate actively. Only difference is that it doesn't decrease the speed over time.

Agreeing with Mike here, it's not the same as Endless ride as Decreasing speed and not requiring throttle are **critical** to what the mode is. In this mode the remote should only act as a breaking device. If it was truly dangerous than you would see more reports of incidents in the Mellow Subreddit or even the ESK8 subreddit as a whole (since there's an anti-mellow phase going on).

Edit: And there's also the fact that to move in this mode you have kick push, I hypothesize that kickpushing on ESK8's can prove beneficial results to range, even more so with a mode that takes advantage of it.

```
Don't like that the board continues alone when you fell off and loose the remote out of your hand. Next issue is how the board behaves when you push, because you have no control over it.

Lets say you start and push only one time. If the board immediately reacts to the new speed by providing power to hold the speed it would be ok. But if you want to do two pushes the board brings you out of balance when it starts powering while your foot is off to board at the haul off for the second push.

By activating cruise with the throttle it is easy to control the board and let cruise be active whenever you want it. Otherwise you need to adapt to the behavior of the board.

And it wouldn't be difficult to ramp down over time. That's the easiest part.

The hardest part is to find a good soft ramping when the board starts powering to hold your current speed.
But finally i don't want the board to continue holding the speed when you felt off and lost the remote. So you need to pull the trigger to activate cruise control. And by this you can shortly release the trigger when you push and pull it again at your new speed.

Why not pull the brake to let it stop. Hold the throttle to allow the board to accelerate. Acceleration is based on how much you push. It decelerates at a specific rate. 

This feature has been discussed over and over in this thread and others many times. I'm fine with you never putting it in. Maybe some day someone more enthusiasm will come along and make a new firmware that everyone will love and will include it. If not, it's not the end of the world.

I tried it and it's fun! But it's a different kind of fun. There are some quirks that make it interesting when changing the PID values, such as increasing the values to lock you in and pumping off of the cruise control to go faster and reengaging it at the faster speed over and over... It's easy to get going *way too fast* this way real quick... But it's just not the same.

I could see lower values working well with a pure push and coast down mode as it wouldn't jerk you around so much as the higher values.

But about the starting push(es), if the board could match the speed that you push (or just a x% below it) and like the mellow board decelerates in n seconds, i guess you wouldn't be thrown off

as a safety precaution I would include the throttle still (or cruisecontrol), this way you can actively control the amount of power (or time). on zero throttle nothing happens (or a settable default current to overcome the boards mechanical friction)

I was wondering the same thing about the firmware. I wish these came with a bootloader installed so it was as simple as the unity.  This looks like a real competitor to the unity I would like to see a side by side comparison of the two

Just set the restricted settings as default then use the APP to change the mode when you ride. If the coppers grab you just power off the VESC and when they power on to check it will load the default restricted settings.

So I have never used the watt limits.  To do this, I can't just click it in the app right?  Because I have to do it for each motor?  Or can I try it in the app without opening up my enclosure and reprogramming both Vescs?  I am sure this is covered somewhere, but I am having trouble hunting it down.

If you set it up as instructed, you can create a "mode" in "Modes Setup" that includes the app mode aka watt/wattNoRevBrake/current/etc.

You can save that mode, and switch to it on the fly. If the canbus stuff is set up properly it'll change on both master and slave vesc. You can long press on the top left box and it'll offer to make the current mode the default (persists across reboots).

This probably belongs in the other thread (https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/vesc-monitor-android-app/20888)

Moreover if you want to check what @deucesdown said you can always connect to the VESC through the app with a TCP connection. Both computer and phone has to be on the same wifi. I find the Hotspot from the phone more stable for this connection. Board as close as possible. In this way you can use the vesc tool without open the enclosure

@Ackmaniac
a small clarification needed, i am working with a focbox flashed by your latest firmware 3.102 and still can't write to the focbox using the old Metr.at module.
From reading here i understood that flashing with version 3.101 or 3.100 should fix that but since i am using a mac and it is hard to find mac compatible complied builds for those versions i want to use the latest 3.102 version UI just with the default.bin file i downloaded from you Github repo looking on the commit history of that folder ([here](https://github.com/Ackmaniac/vesc_tool/tree/5581f16503b28cad50273f808659e23330a3979f/res/firmwares/410_o_411_o_412))

I'm having some firmware issues with this program. Trying to set up dual ESCapes over CanBus. Setting up each ESC separately first, with CanBus cable disconnected.
In regards to firmware, the ESC's each connect with no firmware update warnings and I can go through and make all relevant settings, however when I then connect CanBus and try to select "Can Forward" I get an incompatible firmware warning. 
When I go into the firmware tab for each ESC, when they are connected, I only have the option of "60" in the hardware tab, however, when none of the ESC's are connected, the firmware hardware tab shows a number of firmware versions. WTF??
Here is a pic of the firmware tab with no ESC connected.
![ACK_Firmware1|666x500](upload://jvzeXuGXLmcPPdLCIk803wBkyYh.jpeg) 

Here is what it looks like when I have an ESC connected.
![ACK_Firmware2|666x500](upload://gGE9uRFLA9xuC0Bm0aw3ziDtb5O.jpeg) 

When I go to read the firmware on the ESC, this is what it is showing me.

This problem may occur when both vescs have the same controller id. Check if they do.

If you flashed the ack. Fw on both they should be the same. Donât understand how the versions than could be different

Just for sake of other builders interested in getting this to work, you can use the 3.102 version available and flash your vesc with the 3.101 version available at ackmaniac's github repo ([here](https://github.com/Ackmaniac/vesc_tool/raw/5581f16503b28cad50273f808659e23330a3979f/res/firmwares/410_o_411_o_412/VESC_default.bin)).

Well does your module really use 9600bps or something else? I had mine set at 115200 for example (After fiddling with the firmware on it via AT+ commands).
I also think that Vedder did some modifications to the original firmware so you obviously should check @Ackmaniac's version to be safe. (Maybe you are already using it - I am not sure from the pic you posted). I think @Pimousse made Vedder aware that his modifications break compatibility.

You mean motor parameters and settings? I think if you read them via VESC tool and then update the firmware without closing the tool, then you can just hit write again and it should set it all for you.  No guarantees though - if I were you I'd just do the config again - it's not like it takes a couple hours.

Hi guys.

Anyone had an issue with losing real time data from vesc on ackmaniac app?

I cant get any real time data from any of my 4.12 vescs anymore (i can with vesc tool and serial link though).

![Screenshot_20181006-132342|281x500](upload://rNAekcSYtjXSKHyUnLciyhZZrRc.png) 

They all worked perfectly and now non of them work. ( I have 3 all from different manufacturer's).

All settings appear to be fine. ( App settings on adc and uart. Uart is set to 9600).

Whenever I connect to ackmaniac app the current limits appear but nothing else. 
Bluetooth module is hm10.

Just wondering if its due to a recent update to the app as all hardware has been replaced and still no luck.

Thanks
Steve.

Flipsky have advised that the Bluetooth module they sell will only work with the VESC Tool Android App but I just wanted to see if there was a way to make it work before pulling it out.

It is based of the NRF51 if that means anything to you.

Hey @Ackmaniac I just switched from your old BLDC Tool firmware to the new ESC Tool with 3.102. 

I run BLDC. Hardware 4.12 maytech.

There was a setting in the old tool called "Max ERPM at full brake" that I really liked. If you lowered the number it made the brakes from mid to low speed really smooth and linear as the speed decreased. Now I find in this speed range it feels like the brakes are increasing in power as I slow down even when keeping the remote brake level constant. So I have to release the brake a little and it feels grabby or like its latching. As I release it a little goes from a lot of brake to basically none. 
![image|403x136](upload://q4pLCd2n8yx7DqeuKZqCUqJTi8N.png) 

Is there any equivalent in the new tool? I don't see anything.

Other than that the new firmware is great, much smoother startup from zero speed. 

Thanks for all the work you put in for the community.

X2 motors dual. 5065 140kv, 18:36 ratio on 97mm wheels. 12s Lipo. 

I kinda got used to it at mid speed just need to use less brake on the remote. But low speed to stop is still grabby. Also its more weird on a downhill then flat ground. 

![image|387x334](upload://sETeljWBgCqco9l6tpFZUy4q17y.png) 

I did change minimum current and start up boost for cleaner starts.

I had to do an emergency brake from top speed this morning as a car pulled out in front me. It made me think about putting the battery regen higher for some more stopping power at speed.

@Ackmaniac I want to confirm that when using 2 VESCs connected via CANBUS, that if you change to a different MODE (e.g., a mode that limits the top speed to 10 mph) in ESC Monitor App, it will automatically write to both VESCs? 
For this to work properly, can you confirm what settings the following should be set to on Master vs Slave?
1) SEND CAN STATUS? true or false?
2) MULTIPLE ESCS OVER CAN? true or false?
Also when changing Modes via the app, does it matter whether you are connected to the master vs the slave? in either case, will it apply the changes to both Master and Slave?

Also, if you choose to have the mode change now become the default mode (by long pressing in the upper corner window) does this also automatically apply the change to both Master and Slave?

Finally if you switch between BLDC and FOC, does this automatically apply to both Master and Slave?

Thanks in advance for your help with this!

Thanks @Ackmaniac everything worked fine
Two comments 
1)I cannot input more than one digit in the max speed field. 3 is ok but not 30 for example. It worked before... 
2) with two vesc, when using TCP relay (my BT module being on slave uart) Which CAN FW field is active? The one in vesc tool? The one in the app? Both? For example when can fw is activated in the mobile app, what happens when it is active in the vesc tool too?

@lrdesigns You have already a max regen of -15A for each VESC which should be high enough. Maybe it is a phenomenon of your motors that the VESC can't detect the correct current's at high speed.

@isabar   
1. SEND CAN STATUS? true or false?
Master=false, Slave = true
2. MULTIPLE ESCS OVER CAN? true or false?
Master=true, Slave= false (doesn't matter)
Also when changing Modes via the app, does it matter whether you are connected to the master vs the slave? in either case, will it apply the changes to both Master and Slave?
Only when you are connected to the master. Means you need to see that realtime data of the master. 

And when you overwrite the default it also needs to be connected to the master. Otherwise it only does it for the slave.

Then simply all are asking the VESC at the same time which can cause trouble. Especially during motor detection you should avoid that.

Hey @Ackmaniac !  Awesome tool you provide !  But i'm struggling a bit with fimwares... if you have some time to share, that's would be nice :slight_smile:

I'm currently using "regular" vesc-tool from vedder website and i'm looking to use the watt-mode i was running on the "old" BLDC-tool Ackmaniac version 'cuz it's was cool.

So I get "_ACKMANAIC_-ESC Tool 0.2" ( --> https://puu.sh/BUhBW/187758e944.png lul) but watt mode didn't showed up, maybe I have to do some extra tweaks before using it but i can't figure them out T-T 

Can you or some other cool users help me out ?
That's would be great :wink:

The Current mode is like Watt mode. In the newer firmwares the old current mode doesn't exist anyomre. You can regulate it by the current or by watt in the motor settings.

Thanks @Ackmaniac for the advice. But it does not answer my question. I just want to know if the "Max EPRM at full brake" is totally gone from the new ESC Tool? Or if there is an equivalent setting? 

I know you didn't build the new tool, I just thought you might know why this feature is gone?

![image|502x204](upload://7G9FzQiWwFauJS4638wWp5ssM5k.png) 

The "Max EPRM at full brake" only affected the 5 to 0 mph behaviour. I found adjusting it made the brakes very linier, as in as the speed lowered so did the brake force. 

I have gotten used to the feel of the brakes in high and mid speed now with the new tool, so it's not an issue.

My Bluetooth module is connected to my slave Focbox. I can read the settings (speed, amps,volts, etc) fine from the ESC monitor Android app. But whenever I try to write settings (motor max, motor min, etc.) nothing happens. The same happens on the ios apps. Writing doesn't seem possible. Is there some setting I'm overlooking?

Anyone any thoughts on this?

Edit: 1 out of 10 times the ios app does write succesfully. But when I read the settings on PC I see that only one ESC got updated with the new settings.

Edit 2:
there is a can forward function in the ios app so seems logical, still only works 1 outta 10 times
0 outta 10 times with the ESC monitor android app (connect by CAN to ID = 0 which is the master on the ESC monitor android app is checked)

I think you skimmed my post too fast :stuck_out_tongue: it happens on your ESC monitor android app (reading fine but no writing). As additional info I tell that the iOS app (eskate vesc) doesn't work good either (reading is fine, writing works 1 outta 10 times). The problem I have isn't necessarily located in your app but seems to be somewhere else.

I'm on version 3.102 on the FOC boxes.

And I've seen posts about adding support for writing from slave yesterday but that was from a loooong time ago.

Edit:
Could it be that the reading goes over different wires than the writing? On visual inspection my Bluetooth module wires seem fine though.

Edit 2:
As suggested by emmaanuel I will be looking into a better Bluetooth module.

Edit 3:
I just waterpoof closed my box with hot glue and ducktape, so I'll be looking onto writing from Bluetooth again the next time my board needs maintenance or my new receiver from aliexpress arrives. Thanks a bunch!

This is fantastic, do not hesitate to install the firmware!  I used the latest OSX build to install it on both FOCBOXes in my LaCroix.  The process was painless aside from I forgot to turn on UART again after flashing and completing motor/input configs :slight_smile: so I lost my bluetooth connection for a minute until I figured that out and re-enabled UART. Its a huge improvement over the stock throttle controls which were... downright terrifying as a relative newcomer to eSkates.

Did you test the connectivity with 3.102 shortly before you updated? Because i guess because of the winter you didn't test it for a while and since the last time you used it your smartphone upgraded to android 8 which doesn't work with a lot of  BLE module clones.
But that is only a wild guess. 3.103 works the same as the old version and i have no issues.

Did it work directly before you switched to the new firmware or was that some months before? (Asking because of Winter and maybe your Smartphone Android Version changed)
Only think i can imagine is the change in the COMM_GET_VALUES where the controller Id was added which can lead to a new package that was send and your BLE module might get trouble with that. 
Send me a PM with your email and i can send you the previous version to test if it makes a difference

What i saw so far is that the User Interface changed.
The Motor detection changed.
But when it comes to the control of the Motors in FOC (which most use) then the only real change i can see is smoothening of the transition when you brake shortly before you come to a complete stop, which was basically the idea of @Deodand and is a change of less than 10 lines of code.
And i think i saw a change if you use encoders.
So apart from the User Interface there isn't much that has changed yet when you have already a good working setup.
But i have the feeling that Benjamin will concentrate on motor control optimizations in the future now that he has the User Interface as he want's it. Field weakening for higher speeds would be interesting or Field Injection for sensorless motors.

But personally i think my firmware mod is still better when it comes to the controllability and ride and feel of a electric skateboard (watt control, timeout rampening, traction control offset, cruise control with PPM remotes, different power levels for front and back axle for 4wd).

But everybody can judge themself. I don't have a business interest and simply changed the stuff that i didn't like and that i was capable of.

Benjamin is for sure much more talented and has a much bigger knowledge. But i think his focus is on a universal motor controller for all kind of motors (which is impressive) and i focus on controllability of a electric skateboard with a human body on top of it which can't react as fast as a Microcontroller can do.

It's not a deal breaker not having it unless your having an issue with it imo. 

If you run FOC and experience excessively strong brake locking right before stop and it's annoying you, the fix is great to have. Otherwise no

@rey8801

Replying to your comment in the Unity thread. 

I have found the @Ackmaniac app/tool completely reliable. No connectivity issues at all... since I bought a new Android phone. My previous Android, a Samsung, had problems all the time.

Now I'm on a OnePlus which is not full of bloatware...I turned off power management for the @Ackmaniac tool and have had no connectivity issues whatsoever.

So, check your phone if your having issues.

Seems that your throttle signal changes when you activate the steering on your remote. Best would be to chack that in the tool. Just connect to the master where your throttle is connected. Activate the throttle realtime and check if the throttle ppm signal changes if you activate the steering channel which is connected to the slave.

If that is the case then it might help to increase the deadband a bit.

Cruise control is activated on the feather remote via the trigger button. As soon as I set the speed, I let go of the thumb throttle and just press on the trigger button. But this slowly ramps up to the top speed. 

For some reason, I couldn't get the cruise control on my mini remote so I switched to the feather one since I'm going to be mainly using it anyway.

Thanks for the awesome firmware. Donation coming your way as I type this. Appreciate the time and effort you put into this

cruise control with PPM remotes
[/quote]

- Cruise control with PPM remotes creates a ground loop and can damage your ESC! Such a feature  should not exist! People potentially blow up their ESCs using that feature. Technically wrong, especially with more different Hardware hitting the market. 
- Timeout ramping could be a good feature if you have a reliable detection of remote cutouts (which highly depends on your remote and receiver) Benjamin will ad that, but priority is a remote connection that does not cut out in the first place and has a safe detection for connection issues. Rather than messing around with subpar black box RC recievers, Benjamin focuses on a nice way to handle the issue.
- different power levels for front and back axle for 4WD (how many 4 WD builds needing such a feature exist in reality?) 4WD torque vectoring would be more handy for such builds. A fixed power level shift is possible already with stock FW.

The telemetry is coded already, Benjamin has nailed that in VESC-Tool. Unity runs of modified VESC code, but they made the decision to create incompatibilities, so that users can't use VESC-Tool. Until you can enjoy the new VESC-Tool features in the Enertion VESC-Tool fork it may take a while, depending on how fast they can integrate the Vedder Code.

The data has always been there. The question is what you make from the data set and how you display it. Have a look at the mobile VESC-Tool. You have access to all data from all VESCs in an array and the software combines all data from all VESCs to a useful and accurate set of data. This way you don't only use the data from one VESC to project for example estimated range and Wh usage. This bit was a bit tricky to code.

Sure, but most of it is still Vedder Code. The difference is in using a single processor to run two ESCs. This is fundamentally against compatibility and locks you to use a special, modified software fork of VESC-Tool. For app developers it's not a lot of fun to code for different software solutions. In my eyes it's better to work on one consistent software release that is max compatible.

Because these dual ESCs are made in a way that they are software compatible. Two supported processors run two supported DRV chips. The module needs to be NRF 51 or 52 based. HM10 is to slow for FW updates and reliable RT data.

I think enertion made the decision to build the unity with a single proc for price-ability. It's much cheaper to buy a Unity for a dual motor setup than x2 Trampa VESC's. 

The divergence from vesc tool compatibility is also a product of building a better and cheaper controller. When you force people to change hardware from a solution that has worked for years you can expect some pushback.

Being using the app with vesc 4.12, focbox, Flipsky 6.6 never a problem. I love unity but if would be possible to get it work would be great.

Guess your module has issues sending multiple packages directly after another. that also explains why it doesn't work with version 3.103 where there is a additional packet for the realtime data. But it also could be your phones issue. Maybe test it with another phone if you get Error: 178 as well.

It says that because the focbox restarts when upload is done. Normal behavior. Check the f/w version, it should be whatever you just uploaded.

While your here..   If my motor max is 80a and my battery max is 40a, am I only actually getting 40amps to that motor?

No no motor max is different. Leave at the max current allowed from your motor if you want max output. Search in the forum you will find the physics behind it, but basically motor max can be way higher then battery max

SWEET!   

So hereâs a scenario.    I get a battery built.  He uses the âTiny BMS â for both charge and discharge.   He tells me set esc to 80a battery max.   I set up the Focboxes and use 80a motor max, and also 80a battery max, on each Focbox.  I rode it until the battery was empty without issue.  Is this perhaps from the BMS protection, or the 130a absolute max setting which brings both Focboxes back down to 65a?

Ah ok TIny is the name :joy: My bad, Anyway it's a 60A discharge BMS that were the 60 you measure comes from.

![image|690x222](upload://125w8qHbC6RhRQGpSjSBp93H60A.png) 

Anyhow if you have 80A total from the battery then split it in 2, same for battery min.

Depends which VESC you have, single vesc or in case of unity is fused so you set the battery max as single and then it splits it. So telling you 80a max is correct then is up to what you use.

(Help me tag Ackmaniac or whoever can help!  I have no idea how to tag someone.. thank you gentlemen!!!)

FUCK ME.   Why did I mess with anything ð.  
In mid HIGH SPEED acceleration my motors all of a sudden felt like the brakes where engaged or the motors seizing sending me flying.  Iâm home now, full of road rash & seeking some help.   Here is a picture of the fault that my Xmatic app showed after the incident.
![image|281x499](upload://a96h3AvwkN8zE7yo9zTJtJGCZn7.jpeg) 

So Iâve had a Lacroix for about 10 months now.  The only tweak I made at the beginning 10 months ago was moving the motor amps up from 70a to 80a.   It ran flawless for the next 10 months.   The Focboxes where programmed  using the original BLDC tool and the boxes running that old firmware that worked for that tool.  The factory Settings where these here.  Accept the motor amps which I had bumped up to 80a
![image|690x357](upload://hi6avYZ4bTI5p5FxqaxwgwqM6EV.png) 

So I get the itch for more power and I have hyper ion build me a 12s5p.  Sanyo 20700B.   He used the ( Tiny BMS s516 - 150A/750A) and my two original Focboxes.  I get it back & go to program the Focboxes using the bldc tool once again but this time it wouldnât let me, saying old firmware..  Hyper ion guys already set it up using vesc project changing the firmware.  I couldnât figure out how to switch back the firmware for that BLDC tool so I ended up reading thru this thread and then using the Ackmaniac ESC tool.  Here are the settings I used.   Yes, 80a batt max on each box.  (Per hyper Ion) 

![image|666x500](upload://iEskafEfCmdpoYHkBLHF9pKhtgu.jpeg) ![image|666x500](upload://kZ3ER37L22OniUFOr9JuXWzjDfa.jpeg) ![image|666x500](upload://8w0GMfQxD2mFpcmT7TrsC66qM82.jpeg) ![image|666x500](upload://kbVhFNoUTo1NBsKd6DBYjGhVvlQ.jpeg)

I run the board with those settings for an entire charge.   It actually felt great.   Lots of get up and go in the top end.  She lasted 22 miles before  empty.  No issues during that ride and I pushed it all out plenty times.   Anyhow I get to thinking I should lower the battery Max from what everyone is saying, so I lower it to 60a each box (still much higher than what everyone says it should be but Iâm going off my battery builder saying I can use 80a each box.   Anyhow, I also lower the positive ramping to .2, hoping for more instant torque throughout.   I changed that in PPM and then I also changed that in nunchuk.   Donât have a clue what PPM nunchuk is.   I also then increased my motor Max to 85.   So I lowered the batt max to 60 each box and set motor max to 85a each box.  And lowered  the positive ramping to .2 in PPM & Nunchuk.   

I take it out tonight and not more than two minutes into the ride Iâm sent flying thru the air.. it felt like it bogged down or locked up or seized right when my throttle was fully engaged at around 20+ mph.   

What did I do wrong?   How can I get my trusty, reliable esk8 back?

FAULT_CODE_ABS_OVER_CURRENT means that the VESC was reading a to high current and for safety it shut down.
Both changing "Motor Current Max" to a higher value (to 85A in your case) and lowering "Positive Ramping Time" (to 0.2s in your case) leads to a more aggressive current flowing through your motor and ESC, so that your VESC was reading for a fraction of time a value higher than 130A "Absolute Maximum Current" somehow and shuts down.
I would change back to your settings you had running before without any problems. Always wear some protective gear and test if you get these over current errors on very hard accelerations.

The absolute value is for short spikes. So it can happen that the VESC measures high spikes when it hasto handle high currents. So for example of motor max is set to 80A it can happen that sometimes out of 10000 measurements a second spikes with 100A are measured. And the worse the hardware design of the VESC is (every hardware is different). 
Once the VESC sees the higher current taht the absolute max it will throw an error and shut down immediately. So it is wise to leave some wiggle room between max motor amps and absolute max. But do not set it too high because the absolute max value is there to protect the VESC from too high spikes. But normally 140A should be still fine.

Hey everyone,

first i want to big thanks ackmaniac for his work!!! Really nice to have the option with the android app!

Now to my Problem.
I think i have bricked my two Flipsky 4.12 FESC / VESC.
How and why is a longer story and not the right thread, so to be short.

Can anybody tell me where i find a bin or hex file of the bootloader and firmware (3.102 and 3.103) to flash via a st link v2?

All links i have searched and find on the internet (this forum, youtube, etc.) are down or broken.
I am not able to update via the USB port, cause on both VESCs appears the serial port error "no such file or directory" when i try to update over the ackmaniac vesc tool (same error with the original vesc tool). Maybe all of my 3 USB cable are not able to send data properly, i dont know. 
Thanks for your help!

I've had lots of troubles with the ESC Tool not wanting to connect to the attached VESC. Going mad about those Can't open serial port errors, uninstalling and reinstalling drivers, swapping USB cables, in vain. Until I found out that any instance of Cura (Slicing software for 3D printing) that is open on the PC will try to grab a handle on all available serial ports, preventing the VESC-Tool to access it.... Closing Cura brought instant relief and put an end to my VESC misery.  
Hope this helps others!
