Hello all, 

I noticed how many people are asking for configurable parts or even shafts for their motors. 
Being a student in engineering,  my professors for courses give the class links for manufacturers and supplies that offer configurable parts. 

Here are a few that offer this kind of service. 
-mcmaster
-misumi
-sdp-si
-automationmaterials

Today Misumi came to our class for a presentation. 
My video came out **not the best** (but I sat in the back) ,  but I'll **upload** it just for fun sake. Hopefully it can help out others.

For keeping the list short, 
You can make keyway shafts,  add cutouts to shafts or even tapered end or with holes drilled into one or both ends.......... 
You can customize plates or bearings...........
