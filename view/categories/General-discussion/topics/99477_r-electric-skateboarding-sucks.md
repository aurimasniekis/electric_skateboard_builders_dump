@Hummie posted some info about his hubs, and people just don't seem to get it and seem pretty toxic

Shocker, internet sarcasm rarely works when you are new on a forum.

Hummie dropped a photo, effectively dissed most boards owned by r/electricskateboarding, and left. What could go wrong?

Yea sarcasm doesn't translate well onto the internet, especially with just straight up advertisements. I allow posts advertising new products, but general advertisement is looked down upon.

That shit was hilarious :joy:

If you think itâ€™s too expensive then just donâ€™t buy them and shut up. No one is threatening you to buy them geezzz...

Unless they actually were some cheap rebranded hubs THEN SAY IT!

And the fact that someoneâ€™s butt hurts because Hummie can produce the motors without any big machines is just ridiculous...

I posted a story about my meepo NLS breaking because of the wiring. I didnt add a TLDR but my whole point was warning users who bought the board for its claimed "easy swap battery" to be careful because the wires to my charging port keep coming off. All i got on the subreddit was "get better at soldering", "just fix it again", Are you insane?" and etc. I fixed the issue 3 times in a row. First time I had an engineer of 31 years resolder the wires for me so its not a case of "get gud scrub". The other 2 times were one of the same engineer and another of a friend who coated the thing in solder. The other negative wire finally popped off and I said I want meepo to contact me about getting a new enclosure. All I got was people that were infuriated I couldnt handle the "general repairs that all boards have". Its not a general repair in my eyes and im honestly mad at those redditors for being so toxic. General repairs involve basic things like new bearings and wheels and PU sleeves and whatever, not having special tools and equipment to resolder one of the main features on the daen device.

It's funny how people were like "my phone is more expensive because it requires complex machinery to manufacturer."


But people don't take into account that if your phone dies the worst that happen is you lose some data and contacts ðŸ™ƒ, and if any part of your esk8 fails your playing with your life.

r/ElectricSkateboarding is where people go to show off their new budget China board that they got on a rainy day and where Chinese companies go to shill their boards every two weeks where they introduce an incremental improvement which they then market as a completely new board.  Threads get all quiet when you try to post anything worth a damn.  If I ever want to intentionally raise my blood pressure, I can simply read through a few of the posts there.

I'll probably get banned or verbally abused again for saying this BUT...............................

 Well he has a point! Some esk8 parts ARE ridiculously priced! funny thing is thats just like what happens  on this forum  builders gang up, abuse and bully anybody that happens to calls out somebodies work/product expensive,  this conversation definitely hits a nerve with some builders, it does make you wonder what kinda profit their making on particular parts when they get so uptight and offensive over theses things,!

I agree, a lot of parts are way out of a lot of people price ranges. But when someone doesn't appreciate something by calling it a peice of wire. Or someone that is clueless on a matter, that tries to weigh in on something that they don't understand is what makes people stand up for those who do. Some parts may be expensive but at the end of the day, they are vital in your safety and could lead to life or death. You wouldn't want your car to have parts that while they may be cheap, could sacrifice your safety. It is about considering the balance of price and how much you value your safety.

You can bang on about safety all you like but something been expensive doesn't necessarily make it more 'safe or better' than something cheaper, 

 As iv said id love to see what genuine profit some people are making on certain items, Im not saying every one is taking the piss, im not saying the builder who this post is about is taking the piss, but there are definitely some that are ripping people off but that's ok because your apparently paying for their 'extra' attention to detail and what not since their not a company that mass produces stuff.

I know that the cost doesn't make a difference, but something handmade with high quality materials like @Hummie hubs are obviously going to be safer than cheap Chinese hubs. 

Additionally, of course people can make big profits, if there is the demand for a product and people are willing to pay then you keep it at that price. Its basic marketing. Apple's products are extortionate prices, yet people still buys it. It's capitalism. Lots of people here spend weeks researching the best deals and the best, most quality components. So people don't just see a big price tag and buy!

Not to mention a lot of people in this community seem to think it's not appropriate for our vendors to make a profit on thier work.  Especially when said vendors aren't just pumping out cookie cutter items, they t are developing new things to further the esk8 community.
I'm not talking about vendors who just buy giant Lots of chinese-made parts that you can find on multiple sites. That mark up is bullshit.

I rarely if ever understand these X is not worth Y arguments.  If Y is more than it's worth and someone else is making it for less then there can be some discussion but if the only manufacturer of a product or service charges Y, then it costs Y regardless of how much material or work you think went into it.  As a producer of products or services you charge what the market will bear if you are the only game in town you charge whatever you can.

I've tried almost every vendors mounts on this entire site in his are by far the most solid...

One of the few vendors that actually rides his own product. Do you realize how many of our vendors have almost no skateboarding history and are literally just here to make a profit. Dave's an actual enthusiast.

Yes, this.

Also I need these to get me to work.  What do you think the boss would say if I said I can't come in today because I saved $100 on my motors and they are broken on the side of the road.  Or my face is all scraped off because I valued a C-note more than quality parts on my vehicle.

If you think that, go buy a meepo and stfu.  That's why those things exist.

I'm so tired of those asshats.  It's like people playing with model airplanes telling people who fly real airplanes that their shit is way overpriced and they can't believe how much they pay for a motor.  A motor that doesn't leave you hanging when you need it....

I don't think you can just judge things on price alone though - I mean for the price of an evolve you could build something that would out spec it. If you want to figure out if something is quality you need to apply some common sense and research, which unfortunately quite a few people lack......

You don't seem to grasp that my comments are a response to your attempts to slander a vendor that literally eats, breaths and lives esk8.
If you walk into a room and start talking shiiiiiit about people  thier friends are bound to speak up.

trying to belittle vendors? if having a opinion about certain esk8 prices been extortionate is 'belittling' then sure im guilty as are a lot of other people because as already mentioned on this thread this topic is brought up a LOT! Ever wondered why? could it be possibly these people have a point: wink:

Ohh  and where did i 'slander' a certain vender? not once have a dropped a name, that's you making assumptions and accusations... call it slander, call it what ever you like but the fact is that some esk8 parts ARE ridiculously priced and theres even agreements on that fact on this very thread

Fair enough.

Honestly if you don't want to call peeps out or provide examples stop complaining.  

It's tiresome.  

What's expensive for you is cheap for others.  It's a matter of perspective.

Am I comfortable spending $300 for a Red Ember deck? Absolutely, because I know the time and effort that went into it.  The value proposition is there, and there's no way I would ever take the time and effort to craft a deck like that.  $300 is the shortcut price, and I think that's fair.

You might not think so.  

You have a right to your opinion.  

Don't expect everyone else to respect it though.

It's OK, I haven't heard of you until now either.

Also, I'm not really a 'vendor' per se.  I don't have a webshop.  I do things on commission. Is what is, sasa?

There for sure are some grossly overpriced things on sale, but I think there are also some things where for most people, the quality is taken beyond what is necessary, being someone who is very active on reddit and still also a bit of a DIY elitest, I can see both sides.

Red ember decks are $300 because its hand made, custom and obviously high quality. But in terms of reliability and feel, it likely dosen't have an edge over a $100 Landyachtz deck (Obviously depends what you want in a deck, but the switchblade is a very good one)

Hummie hubs are expensive because they're handmade and have the widest contact patch out of really any setup, making them a lot more comfortable - they're also obviously more reliable. But for those who are looking to go 2 miles and save money, they don't make sense, chinese hubs aren't dangerously unreliable, in fact used within their well known limits they're absolutely fine. Both products are at their respective prices for good reasons. 

I've also seen a few comments here about spending more on parts because cheap ones are unsafe - this isn't true either. Obviously I don't mean get a 1$ set of trucks they won't break because clearly that is stupid advice. But equally, buying a pair of $100 hub motors isn't really any less safe than buying hummie hubs. You're going to have a worse experience with them but they're not going to explode or fall apart. Safety is about how you ride and what gear you wear, and not really what you ride on. DIY Boards are even likely on average more dangerous simply because of the high performance, the chance you'll hurt yourself on a board which tops out at 50mph is probably higher than one that tops out at 23. Its also not really good advice because the only production board which can genuinely be attributed to killing people and injurying a significant number of people by design/quality is the Evolve bamboo GT (Please cite and correct if im wrong here - I try to keep up with news) which was expensive even at the time of release. 

Just to rattle off a few other things - Lacroix's titanium matrix 2s, CNC Truck hangers and from solid aluminum CNC wheel pulleys all have their own advantages but are not major major upgrades from their counterparts which are 5x or even 10x less in price. I'm not saying they are over priced, they are just not what everyone is looking for.

If you haven't noticed, people make their own shit on this forum because the market hasn't provided something that meet their criteria of what they deem to be good enough.  A cheap Chinese hub that is mass produced might not necessarily be objectively bad but it's simply not good enough to what many people on this forum want out of their components.  As far as pricing goes, you somehow fail to understand how economics works.  Are you saying it doesn't take time, effort and out of pocket expenses to develop a product?  How does one recoup those costs?  Just because the Chinese are selling their parts at bargain bin prices doesn't mean vendors on this forum has to because they are not the competition.  Hell, they're not even in the same ball park.  People vote with their wallets and I have it on good faith that many of the people who frequent here know the difference between quality and crap.  This is why we're happy to pay the prices we do to support the work of those we deem worthy.  Value is subjective so if you're not willing to pay to play, you can take your ball and go play in the corner by yourself.

* Nano remotes for $60 ($40 on flipsky and these are being phased out for VX1's because calibration is bullshit)
* Mini Remotes for $35 ($20 on aliexpress)
* Bolt alu wheel pulleys for $40-60 (depends on the vendor but these have to be machined so there's your cost there)
* Poor quality mounts for $60+ (Citation needed)
* Cable connectors, hardware and bearings at ridiculous markups (companies got bills to pay, if you feel like you can do better, go for it)

On one hand I don't like the 100% markup on these items but on the other I also understand that it's a convenience thing.
I've took the time to find the cheapest mini remote I can before, but I've also paid double the price and just added one on to an order that I was doing rather than shipping from two places (plus not wanting to wait for shipping from China)

I can definitely think of some overpriced mounts that a lot of people use. I've used bkb, boardnamics, psychotillers tkp & rkp, marc88, akhlut, enertion and diyeboard mounts. 
My psychotiller tkp mounts were in the middle on price and by far the best mounts ive used. Adjustability,  fitment,  universal, reliability, and ease of installation.

I've broken or bent 3 diyeboard hangers in a year.....

I've had issues with my order from pretty much every vendor ive ordered from. Missing or wrong parts. Damaged parts. Orders not shipping in timely fashion. 

Some venders are amazing,  some could communicate better., some don't at all or just lie. (Diyeboard)

I disagree.  cheap hub motors are more dangerous in many ways and safety is about what u ride on.  I could list the many differences between what I sell and what u can get for 300$ if you want.

Everything on a board is relevant to your safety down to even the smallest bearing and thinnest wire

For sure the remotes I fully understand (Except the TB nano one, its a shitty remote at 400% markup :?)
The wheels and stuff are kind of bad though because genuine abec wheels are the same price after shipping. And the mounts were kind of actually the main thing - people selling thin ass chinese ones for $60 is pretty common when boardnamics/dickyho are way better... Same with the pulley thing. BKB pullys are pretty unique in their modularity - but looking at other vendors they sell basically dickyho pulleys at a 400% markup :/

shorting being the biggest danger and they don't peg everything down well and insulate the motor leads well.

 8mm axles aren't adequate fore the increased span of the motor and more leverage.

 cheap glues and magnets break free. (if they put it in at all)  

 aluminum extruded parts held with little screws as apposed to solid steel bell.

These cause reliability issues - I'm not an expert but I don't see things like a loose magnet being a safety issue? You'd have to ride a long way with some very loud clunking before it destroyed the axle or something. I've also never once seen a hub axle snap, but that might be my own limited experience.

I dont know "who buys these" 83mm clones but that wasn't the point

Mini remotes are $13 in the UK, not sure why they're so expensive in the US. 

The pulleys are from alibaba, exact same as dickyho's $15 ones

As for the mounts, just compare them to dickyho and boardnamics mounts. I don't need to cite them because pretty much every vendor has this issue - don't come back to me with the few that don't. 

I've seen ppm cables for $4 or 4 XT90s for like 8$ before. Thats just a rip off.

reliability equates to safety.  

 If you look at the history of hub motors there have been at least a couple snapped axles posted on the forums

a magnet that comes loose at speed could be really bad news with the increased resistance or possibly worse if it cracks and explodes but more so the biggest risk with cheap motors is shorting with vibrations and shrink wrap wearing away and then a short through the motor case.


this is saying nothing of how the ride feels and the power handling ability...which also come down to safety too really as if youre going along riding rock hard wheels and the motor is also getting too hot it can directly lead to or at least is slowly bringing about other kinds of failures

I suppose its all possible - but incredibly rare :/ I think no matter how high quality something is, after 100000 pcs are distributed SOME have to show issues. I have helped and repaired hundreds of people and not seen anyone have their hub break down dangerously. Many have reliability issues in that 1 hub will stop running, develop clicking noises, or not turn, but its not really been while going at top speed and the chances of it happening, at least in my experience, are so low that it doesn't mean that you need to buy expensive hubs to be safe.

nothing is a 'false statement' in regards to somebodies opinion on prices been underpriced or overpriced because it's exactly that, An opinion everyone has one and their often not the same! Just because you dont agree with my opinion doesn't make it wrong, regarding naming vendors i think [Anubis](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/u/Anubis) has pretty much explained everythingearlier in the thread about some eu vendors.

First raptor 2 event in San Francisco, and a raptor 2 truck broke on a guy and got hurt.

Since then, many bent trucks resulting in injuries.

Recently, a raptor 2 wheel fell off and injured the guy.

Both design flaws. Why? Cause they cost $100 per set for enertion to produce. Beyond a solid design, you can't buy quality parts for even 1 motor at that price.

If a magnet comes lose while riding, it can very easily jam the motor and eject you like an emergency ejection seat in a fighter jet.

If a motor shorts, it can jam the motor and again, eject you.

I have seen many people over the years get injured from shitty hub motors that have no "real" Quality Control.

The tests these companies do are so bad, they are funny.

One of them posted a video showing how they test them: Run at full speed for 24 hours on the bench. That tells you very little. Pulling .01 amps will create no heat in even the worst of motors. There's no vibrations either created in this test. They literally only tell you if the motor is shorted or not before shipping. That doesn't tell you that they will short on the first ride because they didn't think they needed winding epoxy. Or that the shitty epoxy they used trapped a huge air pocket in the winding that will lead to a short when a "real" load is put to them.

Or the test course in the factory that is maybe 50 ft in circumference, with a 2% grade block of wood for 5 feet to simulate a hill...  That is completely useless.

There's a lot of overpriced stuff, I agree. Enertion charges at least a 6x markup on everything they sell. So they buy things as cheap as possible, and they sell as high as possible claiming super awesome high quality, while they cut every corner in the book.

IMO, they are the biggest offender of this. Carvon was they same way. At least Jerry would stand behind his work to some degree though, but those where very overpriced as well as I had bending truck issues and shorts as well.

But at some point, you will realize after you get a few operations from injuries as I have, that quality does equate to reliability. If your busy trying to create a business, you probably don't have time to actually ride your product day in and day out (unless your Kaly). It's important that those designing and manufacturing actually use them and abuse them day in and day out. Other wise, it's hard to see how the short cuts they take actually effect their customers.

They do vibration test the battery/hubs and the stress test isn't unloaded, hasn't been for a while. Just saying.

My point is the failure rate on these CDM Jointech hubs is tiny, and what's more, in all my experience with budget boards, which is a very large exposure to my knowledge, I have pretty much never seen a catastrophic failure on a modern cdm hub (2017+, not the really old ones like the 70mm ones). Yes its possible for the magnet to lock the motor or for it to short, but are there examples of this? If its only happened 3 times ever out of 100k motors made then its realistically not a point. Hell even a 0.001% failure rate on a motor which can't go faster than 26mph isn't large at all - and it very likely isnt that high.

edit: I should note there was an isolated case of a batch of hub motor trucks (Not the motors themselves) with a weak cast, obviously that is a quality issue. But they were recalled, and something like that is bound to happen when the quantity is high enough. 

I'm not saying higher quality hubs don't have their value and place, its just, in my opinion & experience, bullshit to say the cheaper hubs are dangerous.

At no point in designing the hummie hubs, was the question asked, "how do we keep the price low so we can have huge profits?". Never. Ever ever ever.

Instead, the question was "how can we make the most indestructible yet powerful hub motor?". In just about every part, we had the option of spending $1 or 15-30x that. Bearings are a great example of this. Magnet glue and epoxy glue is another example. Magnets are another example. Tires are another example.

Just about every piece was designed to do what it's intended without cost in mind. There never was any discussion about how we can lower costs. Because then we would have to change the engineering to something that wouldn't be the best we could do.

I'm just saying the test's I've seen them advertise they do are not going to tell you much.

People send John motors all of the time and we can't believe the short cuts they will take.

MAD Hubs for example don't use magnet glue at all... Just lose magnets. That is very dangerous. I don't care if you don't hear 8 million people complaining they got hurt by them, that is simply dangerous.

I've seen other hub motors from china that don't even have any motor winding epoxy. That again, is dangerous.

The hub motors your talking about, I'm not familiar with particularly. So I can't speak about them specifically.

I am just telling you the things we are seeing from cheap hub motors that are simply dangerous from a scientific standpoint. Your introducing more points of failure. Goal #1 of any engineer should be to reduce points of failure.

I, as many in this topic, have been in this game a long time. I've seen many threads over the years about problems. And I've inspected many broken hub motors I've been sent also. This is simply what I'm seeing.

The hubs I would put my "Safe if used within their limits" are Backfire and the """replaceable pu""" hubs used by meepo/wowgo/ownboard. I also haven't heard anything bad about meepo 100mm hubs yet, but they have had a few bearing failures leading to clicky motors. Obviously they are not at the peak of reliability, but failures are all slow and not dangerous

Well that's like saying "who needs brakes on a hill?". What if you have a single drive and a motor fails on a downhill. It doesn't launch you, but now you have no brakes?

I think the problem is were just looking at completely different markets.

Hummie hubs are designed to be high power and high reliability. If you need to get to work or school, with consistency, never being let down, in high comfort with 78a high rebound easy to replace tires that handle abuse incredibly well.

I'm guessing the motors your talking about are around 1000 watts each. I run 2500 watts per motor in 4wd. I would burn those motors up if I used them because I would be asking for too much, lol.

These cheap china hubs, whether or not they will kill you, are just aimed at a different consumer. It's like cameras. You have a consumer, prosumer, and professional category. Most hub motors are in the consumer catigory. Hummie hubs are designed somewhere in between the prosumer and professional category. We could still make a few tweaks... That would increase cost significally, lol. But that's what is all about. At what point are you going to say "this part of the motor costs too much"? Is $150 in bearings per set motor too much?

I have gone this this lining many times before, but I guess I need to go through it again:

- 80c magnet wire multistrand vs 200c solid strand wire = more copper (less insulation). The insulation is the same on a 12awg vs a 22awg on magnet wire. Single strand wire stays cooler and is rated for higher amps also, so you get a cooler motor that can output more power. The 200c wire will last much longer since it breaks down the insulation at a slower rate on higher heat wire.

- Off the shelf cheap china bearings vs NSK High Temp sealed bearings = less rolling resistance and better life span. Better lube. Tigther tollerances in the machine allow a more accurate spin that reduces lateral forces that create friction. Less rolling resistance and longer life. This is not to mention hummie hubs bearings are many times larger also, so they will put up with abuse much better.

- General purpose epoxy dipped (or no epoxy) vs lab tested and developed by motor winding epoxy experts here in the USA epoxy in a vacuum impregnation. This specific epoxy will withstand more vibrations for a longer duration, while allowing the winding's to properly breath and dissipate heat. General purpose expoxy's trap heat in, and when dipped instead of vacuum impregnated, results in air pockets getting trapped in the epoxy/winding, which will lead to a hot spot and then a short circuit.

- N38 or lower vs N48sh magnets = Significantly stronger magnetic field that results in more torque. Thus you will need less energy (more energy efficient) and create less heat. So again, cooler motor that can output more power. The "sh" also denotes they are curved and high heat, so they can tolerate much higher temps.

- No epoxy or General Purpose epoxy vs Magnet Epoxy = A bond that surely will never fail. If a magnet gets lose, best case, your motor is done. Worst case, you get launch cause it's like a rock in motor. It can't rotate any longer and off you fly.

- 8mm axle vs 12mm axle = Stronger by over 6 times, ensuring no bending or snapping during normal operation.

- 90d with a core wheel vs 78a motor tire = Way more rebound which result in a plush ride instead of a harsh ride.

- small stator vs large stator = 3-4x less heat generated which means you can run higher power settings without overheating the motors.

Now, if you break down the costs:

china set of motors:
bearings - $1
- wire - $2
- stators - $5
- machined parts - $5
- trucks - $5
- wheels - $8
- assembly - $5
- total: $31 per set with trucks and wheels

hummie hubs:
- Bearings: $140
- Wire: $30
- stators - $30
- machined parts - $50
- trucks - $40
- wheels - $240 (will be cheaper in future but need to get molds made)
- assembly - $100
- total: $660 per set. Now you need some wiggle room for shit to go wrong, but there's little to just about NO PROFIT!

I'm tired of people saying it's just some wire and metal... It is not. Hub motors are very intricate. Go make one and you'll see. I would be surprised if you understood the basic principle of how a dc motor works.

In our case, we are limited by space, just like an iphone. How do you make a strong motor (usually means thicker walls which is bad if you have little space), can do high output (2500+ watts per motor) with out over heating (you need bigger stator and more copper, and fit that all into a tight space.

You won't find any china hub motor that can sustain anything near 2500 watts per motor.

You can complain about how expensive a Bugatti is or go watch a dougs review of one and see why... The attention to detail is amazing. And quality is there in every piece, even those pieces you'll never see. This is like that. It's the hyper car of hub motors.

This, thank you!

People put down these because they have the mindset gained from previous hub motors, probably decent/low quality, which gives the stigma that these hubs could probably be not up to par.

I myself was skeptical as well, and asked i think... 15 people who have the previous ver of the hummies on what they think, all recommended it in a heartbeat. 

I have backed the project, and am excited to get it come January.

Getting people to understand the difference is hard. I need to lay out all of the technical information, which is boring. Really boring, for most.

Even in this, I havenâ€™t described everything. There is basically no profit margin. John disagrees with me on this, but from the perspective of buisness, itâ€™s hard for me to invest too much time into these motors. Cause thereâ€™s really no money to make here. If I tried working on these full time, I wouldnâ€™t make enough to pay my bills cause the profit is so low. Thatâ€™s cause quality is the only focus. I canâ€™t stop working on these because itâ€™s become a passion of mine. But neither of us are in this for the money. Its about creating a class of our own where cost is not a factor and the best quality is all that matters. Yes, they cost a fortune, but they cost us basically the same fortune to make.

If we wanted a proper 2x markup which is standard in most indursties, then we would charge $1300 for a dual drive.

Kind of frustrating that many of the things you mention are required for regular motors too. Nobody seems to be stepping up the game and we see different motors from different brands fail over and over again, making things even worse by advertising closed designs that supposedly keeps the dirt out. Couldn't care less about that after seeing what my old SK3 have endured. I need cool motors. 

Brushless motors for drones already switched to single strand some time ago (years) and some even implement a different material for the tapped windings preventing stripping. I would pay for a good 6374 or bigger motor with most of your points addressed. Single strand, stronger magnets, good epoxy for windings and magnets preventing shorts but also transfers heat, good freaking exits for phase wires that don't rub.

The problem is capitalism. Everything is about making as much money as possible as quickly as possible. So they go to factories in China, with or without a design, and have them make complete motors for them. The factories want a solid profit and the company selling to consumers want a solid profit. NSK charges what they charge for quality large sealed bearings. Epic resigns charges their arm and a leg for good motor winding epoxies, as that is their bread and butter.

If any other company put these quality parts into a motor, as I said before, at least $1300 usd for a dual drive kit. Which is crazy. You think $700 ish is high... so few would buy at $1300. So everyone cuts corners to save money to make it profitable while still bringing it to a price that enough are willing to pay.

A lot of these improvements give you maybe 5 - 10% improvement each. But when you add them all up, you end up with a 40-60% better motor. The cost however for a 40% better motor is not 40% more expensive, as you can see.

Most companies will go until they stop seeing a linear gain for the extra cost in the parts. For example, why pay 3 times the price for a bearing thatâ€™s only 1.5 times as good. Thereâ€™s good reasons as you can clearly see that a 50% gain in performance is huge, but not if profits are your main goal. Youâ€™ll reach more customers by keeping prices lower and using the lower quality bearings, and as reddit has shown us, most will deny there is even a difference because they simply donâ€™t understand how motors are engineered and assembled. Itâ€™s about profits, not quality, if you want eskate to be your income.

Since profits are not the goal with hummie hubs, we made these improvements. The goal is simply to out perform and outlast any and everything else on the market.

Yup, you are correct and things scale differently for the drone industry on all levels...

NSK bearings and a proper magnet epoxy, along with retainer rings that actually stay put would already be a significant improvement without driving cost up too much beyond the consideration of most, but again even that would be mostly appealing to those running mtbs, which is a niche of a niche.

Good Bearings and motor winding epoxy are still very expensive. You could double the price of a motor for say $40 to $80 easily by upgrading these 2 pieces alone.

The key is understanding what you are buying. Are you buying a toy to play with or a serious method of transportation. If your on the later, you want the best parts across your entire build.

Toyota will make decisions that sacrifice quality in the name of making affordable cars. So you wonâ€™t see new Toyota corollas with carbon ceramic brake pads. Youâ€™ll be lucky to see ceramic brake pads. But you would expect nothing less on a Bugatti.

So itâ€™s about what do you expect.

The only difference between this car analogy and eskates is low quality brakes probably wonâ€™t injure you, as they will just be less effective, not more prone to failure.
