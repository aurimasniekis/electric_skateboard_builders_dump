This is what I used. I also used electrical tape and gorilla tape in case they rub.

Yeah, I would love some 200-220mm if I didn't have to wait forever to get it.  I can't wait that long, pretty much everything is done, lol.

It is usually adhesive. It doesn't matter. Insulation is the goal.

adhesive makes it a LOT easier.

I use adhesive fishpaper rings on my packs.

I use BIG rolls of kapton tape to be able to wrap **any** pack
