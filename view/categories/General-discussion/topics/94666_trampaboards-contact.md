No emails and not able to call their number. I'm trying to get confirmation that the product I ordered has been acknowledged. Their worldpay thing says so, but also says not really till trampa sends an email. Been about 5 days and waiting. Anything I can do besides wait more? @trampa

Check your spam folder. You should get a confirmation mail pretty much close to the time you ordered.

It's not spam. The email with it never gets any spam. I've tried to email them as well.

Just check your spam, sometimes orders get sorted to spam by googles algorithm

One of the guys over here had similar issue the last days. Waiting for a reply from trampa about order status. Maybe there is an issue with there mail service @trampa ? Usually Ted reply super fast if he’s not sick or in vacation.

I cant even get any password reset or anything from them. No emails whatsoever. Worldpay isnt a full confirmation since it says "This confirmation only indicates that your transaction has been processed successfully. It does not indicate that your order has been accepted. It is the responsibility of Trampa Boards Ltd to confirm that your order has been accepted, and to deliver any goods or services you have ordered."
