I was looking for batteries and saw a 36v batteries which like a 12c*? battery? why are we sticking with Elongated bundles of batteries instead of picking these compact ones?

Well for a lot of reasons first of all building your own 18650 package is going to be far more compact compared to that and will probably also have more capacity per weight. Also you'd need two of those in parallel to get enough capacity and discharge rate and that would cost about twice as much as your own DIY pack.

So much for innovation then, I just figured we are a DIY community.

What do you think is inside of that "compact" battery?

Hint: 18650 cells

Saw some body DIY'ed and e-bike using multiple dewalt 20v batteries.  Its doable.
But, yeah, not compact enough.  Ground clearance.

LG, Samsung, Panasonic, and Sony are the Big Four when it comes to 18650s.
