I had to ride home from work on wet streets last week and even though it wasn't raining, my legs and the top of my deck got soaked. I got thinking that it would be easy enough to print some splash guards to fit on Caliber trucks and just cover the top half of the wheels. Is there anything like this out there? I'd be willing to pay for a set since I have zero modelling or 3D printing experience.

I am! I'm planning on designing some fenders, possibly with headlights, for my board. Think somewhere between 1930s cars and steampunk (I hope). I have 8 inch tires though, so they might be a tad large for yours. What do you have in mind?

Oh sounds very cool! I was just thinking something super simple that would slip onto the truck and cover the wheel but I hadn't really thought about it more than that (I'm not a creative type)

No worries! Depending on your budget you could try this site: https://wheelshields.com
At a glance their stuff looks pretty good, but I don't really know anything about them.
I could design something simple for you, but the 3D printer I just ordered won't be here for anotherâ€‹two months or so. Unless you want me to send you the file and you can find someone near you with a printer.
The last option I'd suggest is for you to try using Tinkercad.
It's a free online 3d modeling program, no download needed.
It's intended for people with no CAD experience, so it's really easy to use.

Thanks for the pointers! Those wheel shields look just about perfect but $90 for a set is outrageous! I'll keep you in mind and get back to you in a few months if I'm still looking for something.

I don't know who originally created this model, its a splash guard fro 90mm wheels.

While waiting for my wedge adapters to be ready, I thought I'd put up a little teaser for something I'm working on for the tire-inclined among us:

Coming (as) soon (as I get my own 3D printer- so, about a month and a half)!

That is deadly, t have seen one other one on thingiverse made by @Duffman I think

I like yours but 8" or 9" ...I can run you a test print if you like

Meant for Kegels, but could be adapted for any wheel.

Would be nice if someone could make a 97mm wheel Version! I would immediately print it.

I shortened the fender by 4mm as the 97's are a little thinner than the kegels.  I don't have a model of the 97 flywheels.  

Hardware is M5.  (4) 35mm bolts and (4) M5 locknuts

@High-roller @t0m_r1dd1e 
I thought the same thing about the wheelshields ($90 :open_mouth: ) 
I designed a pair which can be 3d printed and there up on thingiverse. 

https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2432745

Designed to fit a 80mm wheel but can be used on any board type, truck etc. It's  attached via the nut which makes it super simple to attach and remove. I have been testing them for about a month with no issues so far.

I developed one for 97mm wheels. Which can use a clamp for which any truck you need and some angle adjustment. It fit really good but when going over bumps it made the most hideous rattling sound so I immediately took them off and didn't get around to designing a V2. Id rather get all wet than hear that sound again. 

I think the issue was that it was too flexible and too close to the wheel so it would flex and kind of bounce on the wheel and make a terrible sound.

Nicely done! Perhaps you could solve the rattling bye increasing the clearance between the wheel and the splash guard, it looks very close right now.

did anyone ever get to printing these or trying? Perfect what i had envisioned... i tried downloading the file and isolating just the fenders but maybe im a noob...

Just a heads up, I've been printing shields all last fall and they crack apart from the vibration super fast. I just use a sheet of lexan across the front and back now...

How thick are the shields you're printing? Mine are about 4mm and I smeared a light coating of silicone sealant on the underside.

Very nice, the rubbing could be addressed by having it mounted on both sides? Two version 
Regular width
Wider version to go pulley

So does anyone have a 97mm wheel splash guard by now?

It rains here almost every day and when It stops I usually go for a ride and end up cleaning my boots for 20minutes and have to wash my pants lol

Trying to get this thread active again. 

@tonycamaro427 that looks sick! Can you add some more pics that are not fuzzy please :slight_smile:
I found the link for these https://www.sickboards.nl/en/accessories/18435-exile-mudflap.html
Do these work for 107 wheels? What is that thing in the rear? 

@akhlut Is there any way you could modify your design for 107 superflys and CNC them in aluminium kinda like what wheelshields does? I'd purchase them from you.

I know this post is a couple of years old now, but was wondering if you had any success with fenders for AT wheels? I have a Backfire Ranger X1 and have been looking for a solution that will be easy to install and not look completely terrible - this design looks ideal!

That design was fairly successful, though it wasn't perfect. I'm pretty sure I uploaded it to thingiverse.
You can see here how it bolts together, just two peices. If I were to redo the whole thing I'd make it as three peices, two halves that clamp to the trucks and the fender itself, this would make printing much easier and I wouldn't need supports.
![IMG_20180209_095240_02|690x453](upload://dJPNalpBZN7nR5ALrdzyp6ElETs.jpeg) 

Since then I've been working on a new design, I'm not sure yet how far I'll take it.
