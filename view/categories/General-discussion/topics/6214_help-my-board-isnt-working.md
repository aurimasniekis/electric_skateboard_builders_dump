i took my board out today and something weird started happening. whenever i step on the board the remote doesn't seem to work and sometimes it will work for 2 seconds then stop again. when there is no load on the board it works just fine. what could this be?

Wiring is kind of messy but everything looks to be connected

Could be the remote...


Try to run it again and shake the remote and see if that does something to the throttle as you are pulling the trigger

Humm ... I don't wanna say it's a jacked motor.....and

Thank you, This one is a bit more clear, and it seen that de solder is ok. And do you see any loose wire, or component that doesn't look solid.

sound like a internal problem from one of the mechanical part (can be trigger, or the one of switch), maybe @torqueboards had encounter this problem before.  AND IS THE Crystal still Glue to the board (the part with hot glue)

@wieg16 - So the remote only moves when you turn it horizontally? I know someone had this issue and something was shorted similar to what you mentioned or something else. For the life of me, I can't remember who it was. They fixed it though.

Anyhow, just send that one back to me and I'll ship you a new one. Send me an email.
