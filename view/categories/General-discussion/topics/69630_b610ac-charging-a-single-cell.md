I don't know why i can't find anything on this but how do i charge a single cell or p-group with the B610AC balance charger? Has anyone done this?

I found a discharge option for 1S but not a charge option in the menu.

@longhairedboy Why not use the charge output on your Sunkko welder? That’s what I’ve done in the past with misbehaving cells. Worked a treat!

Not totally sure about that specific unit but you need to be in charge not balance function.

i figured it out. Feeling pretty dumb but you basically just connect the cell or cell group to the main "output" ports on the side and then go to the charge menu and when it gives you the chance to confirm everything you back it down to 1S with the menu buttons. 

duh
