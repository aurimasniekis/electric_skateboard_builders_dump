I recently purchased flipsky dual 4.20. Problem during setup turn on ESC all lights turn on both side of the esc and suddenly left side esc lights turn off?and now only the right side only working left side is dead can't access it. Im using 10s5p Panasonic batteries. Did I received a bad batch?![IMG_20190729_091852684|375x500](upload://xRvgNESg5gY0Pt5P39pcJiC6jct.jpeg)

This has been an issue with the dual 4.20.

Try reflashing it under the firmware tab and starting over. After a bit of messing around, i got mine back to normal and its been great since.

Did it work out for you? I have one and the left side never lights up and trying to see if I can get it to program. I plug the Micro USB in the port and it won't detect it. Are we suppose to program it only on the right side? I've never seen any lights on the left side. Please let me know. Thanks.

I had to send mine back to flipsky. Ask for an exchange unit if you can
