I currently have the 7 inch AT tires but I'm planning to get some 8 inch tires for a higher top speed.  My first set of tires lasted 1000 miles.  The 8 inch MBS tires look like they won't last that long so I think I'll finally try the 107s after that for more speed.  Can anyone that has the 107s please tell me approx. how many miles they are getting per set?

Thanks.

I've got about 4-500 miles on mine. The drive wheels are just slightly coned without much wear beyond that, and the front wheels are pretty fantastic... Almost like the shine has almost just not gone away- still smooth. I'll have to rotate them at some point soon to keep the wear even.

First thing I did when I got them was lightly drift them a bunch of times around a parking lot to grind away the shine and make them ride and slide more predictably... Since then I haven't noticed too much wear. 

I weight about 190lbs and I don't ride too hard often. Only the occasional drift or slide a few times every few weeks, and light carving with mostly straights on mostly good to some okay pavent.

The edges of my wheels have very *very* small chunking, like micro chunks about the size of a quarter of a grain of rice down to mostly large grains of sand size chunks... Nothing major at all.

I've got 2500 + miles on 6 shooters with 6x2 wheels and they still look new when you wash them.  I got about 500 miles out of evolve 7in tires before the radial started showing.  I can't really say on MBS 8in tires, haven't ridden them very much.  I've got somewhere around 4000 miles on a set of 97mm Flywheels and they still look great, no chunking, but I don't slide on them.

I can't wait to get my 6x2 tires........ I've been waiting for two weeks now with no update beyond this:

I should have just paid a tiny bit extra and ordered from psychotiller... Great to hear they have lasted you so long so far! :-D

Sounds like the urethane wheels last much longer.  I'm just about ready to skip over the 8 inch tires and go straight to the 107s.  The cost to upgrade everything is a lot more but hopefully I won't need new wheels as often and I want more SPEED!

I ride bike trails primarily so most of my trips are somewhat smooth.  My calves get really sore though even on the pneumatic tires which is why I've been hesitant to switch to urethane.

Somebody please pump up the 107s some more so I can finally click this submit payment button!

The latest 107s have numerous reports of chunking problems. So although in theory 107mm of urethane should last you a lifetime, if they start chunking you'll feel the need to replace much sooner.

Ugh chunking.  I've never really ridden on urethane.  I come from snowboarding which is why I like the pneumatics.  

What causes the wheels to chunk more?  Sliding?  Never done that.  I just want to carve and go faster.

Can you notice the chunks a lot while riding?  Does it increase your chances of falling off?

[/quote]

Uneven pavement, cracks, holes, rocks, pebbles, going up curbs, so many things can contribute to chunking. It's hard to tell, these wheels take a lot of abuse unless you live in an area with only smooth roads.

Sliding can contribute I guess, but I was not referring to that specifically. If you slide, forget about the lifetime longevity I mentioned, lol.

Not really, in my experience, they don't affect the ride too much. They just look super ugly.

These have an estimated 3000 miles on them and they perform just fine.  Probably good for another 5000 at least.  They just aren't pretty to look at.

I assume those are the green superflys right? I could care less how they look.

From what I'm seeing online the greens ones are more durable.  Is that right?

Easy, I've had them for a year, I ride alot.

If you want specifics. They were on my vanguard for 
~4000 miles

And they've been in the Evo since I built it, which now has ~2700 miles on it. So really closer to 7k

Black pigment can weaken some urethane formulas, yes. But it's impossible to say with certainty if that's the case for ABEC11's formula. Only their chemist would be able to confirm that.

The key to a superfly lasting is to constantly glue them.

I have 2 partial chunks, and hundreds of cuts. Every time I service my bearings,(once a week) I superglue all of the splits/cuts in the urethane.

Doesn't matter what type of wheel it is. Thick thane will split. Some will chunk, but chunking is caused by splits. ABEC, Boa, MBS, doesn't matter. If the thane is over 27mm it's gonna split, it has no support structure. So glue them when you service bearings.

![IMG_20180807_163556|374x500](upload://4ykIp1wP8BWYjcaMwdZzLJweklN.jpg)

See all the hairline cuts? They all need to be regularly glued. Or they will eventually chunk.

Superglue is cyanoacrylate it doesn't really come in different blends, just different labels/bottles/tubes...

Just in case you don't know about it already, I thought I'd mention Locktite 480! It's a rubberized cyanoacrylate AND it's black ðŸ˜Ž. Pretty damn strong stuff, I used it to fix a TB Motor with loose magnets for @ih8Darian . I'm gonna try it on the wheels for sure!!

Btw, you service bearings weekly?? F*ck that shit, lol

Don't. The point is regular superglue is thin, it makes bulges on the wheels, and about 200ft of rolling wears the excess off so that all that remains is the stuff filling the gaps

Yeah, I just roll them until they sound like they're about to seize and replace them with Redz or something cheap.  Otherwise I'd be spending two hours per day doing bearing maintenance.  Okay, exaggerating but only slightly

How often do you get to that point? On my drive wheels I have the bones RACE reds ($25 a set but worth it for sure) and I haven't changed them for 6+ months. Maybe they're sealed better with the extended race ðŸ¤”
Up front on my SF Truck Im running Abec3 EMQ bearings with **contact** rubber seals and they're silent after a few months of service too.

That being said, I don't commute, but I'm oceanfront with sandy salty roads

After 50-70 km and Iâ€™ve seen at least 20 of them chipping really quick. Tbh Iâ€™ve never seen one that didnâ€™t chip. My 97 mm flywheels started chipping after ~1000 km but they are still fine after ~2500 km.

Superfly chunk easily during the break in process when the mold edge is still on them. They take about 75 miles to break in... That is their most venerable point is new...

During the summer my bearings seem to be fine the whole season -- but as soon as I run in snow and brine I start eating skate bearings for breakfast, so the cheaper, the better

I think my wheels speak for themselves..  :) it really is that simple... You don't have to do it weekly... I just ride 250-300 miles a week so it's something I pay attention to and do in that 250-300 mile cadence.  

It works well because the excess wears off quick, but the thin bonding in the cracks keeps the urethane bound so the wear Patten is correct. So you don't end up with an out of round wheel/non balanced wheel like with other solutions like epoxy. And as the surface wears, new cracks will form. Previous cracks will wear away and not continue splitting inward, and be fresh urethane underneath... Ongoing cycling of new cracks, glued cracks, worn away cracks for the life of the wheel.

Edit: this has been glued since the first 75 miles, with superglue it's still here thousands of miles later

I've been wanting to find something to repair wheels and have kinda been on a passive lookout for a good candidate, but... for some reason I never thought to try the stuff I had.

I use superglue for everything, I keep Superglue, JBweld and Duct tape in my glove box.

I would have thought it would shear along the crack, or it just wouldn't bond properly.

Yeah some need refilled a second time. But alot of them, you will see a super white cut or pit that was filled in the middle of the glue mark. All the excess wears off quickly leaving just the solid white filling.

I buy them from the manufacturer a little cheaper than that. But I have to front the cost of buying them in bulk. Shipping is usually more than $400. Storing them, boxing them up, and handling returns or warranties. What do you think that's worth? Is it worth supporting someone from your community that took the lead in Spearheading Pneumatic 6" wheels for skateboards? Or is it better to order from them and wait a month and a half. Who do you talk to if a tube has a funky valve? Not me right?

No no you are absolutely right. Even before I bought these, I thought $55 for a set of 4 is great value. It only makes sense to order directly from china if one is ordering in bulk.
 I am collecting items for a new ambitious board that's probably not going to be built for 4 months or so, so I didn't care about the waiting part.
