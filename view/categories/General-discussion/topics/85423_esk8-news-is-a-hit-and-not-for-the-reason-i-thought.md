@longhairedboy, @mmaner, and others have come together and started a project called ESK8(dot)News. I didnt look at first (despite the Instagram proddings of LHB), because I thought it would just be a reguritation of this forum.

I was very wrong. 

This site is a fantastic collection of reviews, tips, interesting facts, and good journalism that reminds me of an NPR broadcast in text. Mike's years of product testing is out there, LHB's building expertise, and there seems to be a career journalist writing as well (@BillGordon). 

Do yourself a favor and go check it out at http://

+1 I've said it before, LHB could write sketch comedy, for real.

This is legitimately as funny as the Inquirer lol

Agreed, but don't distract him.  We want him to keep being an esk8 writer.  Because I read esk8 stuff.  And I enjoy reading things he writes.

Not going to lie, i am glad this was shown.  I need some esk8 news and something refreshing. 

The forums in here have been getting fucking adolescent. Customer bashing, questionable ethics...just straight up some ppl needing to be a damn penis wrinkle.

So thanks @mmaner and @longhairedboy for bringing enjoyment back into this community.

Thank you. All of you. This is something I've been working toward since Vegas when i shared the idea with @treenutter and @Lunasi. I was pleasantly surprised when everyone wanted to just jump on board. @mmaner  is a very strong writer indeed and i love editing his articles. @anorak234 is also over there writing good content as well as @billgordon and @Sender  

The plan is to cover everything that matters, starting with basics and staples then working our way out into nuance as allowed by time. We cover high end, low end, and everything in between. 

We're just getting started, so content is trickling out for now but I'm setting up to do a lot more interviews. JED boards was the first of many. I'm going to talk to everyone in the industry one by one and get to the bottom of whatever nonsense is out there at the moment. 

Guest writers will always be welcome, we'd love to have as many of you share your knowledge as possible. We're also always looking for additional core writers as well to put out regular content. 

And maybe, just maybe, if we work at this and make it big, we'll all get paid and possibly make enough to help fund awesome events. 

This is a magazine and we will be placing ads as soon as traffic permits, probably a flat rate system to start. However, we will be reaching out to vendors from this forum first as a courtesy because this is where we came from. Without the builders forum, none of this would have been possible.

Thanks for the post, I now have the site bookmarked!

As a new eSk8 enthusiast can I make a suggestion/request?  Can you create an article about how to build your first DIY board?  I understand if you don't want to since it may be a lot of work to maintain; if you list an actual build with parts it would become outdated relatively quickly and could need to be updated.  Lots of pictures are needed, video is most helpful.

Here's my reason for asking.  I just fell in love with eSk8ing last summer.  My neighbor bought a board and as soon as I road his board I knew I wanted one, but I wanted to build a DIY board.  I wanted to know what all the parts were and how they worked.  It wasn't long before the realization that there was so much to learn set in and I became frustrated.  I tried to understand what I needed to do, but I was overwhelmed.  I kept at it and I started to understand the different major components (thanks to this forum) but I was afraid that I would order mismatched parts, or a motor too small, wrong battery... in general I was afraid to waste a bunch of money making mistakes while learning.

I ended up finding a DIY build on a different site and I liked what I saw (it included a video of the final build) so I decided to jump on it.  I'm now the proud owner of a DIY eSk8 that I love and would only change one thing about it.  For a first time build I'd call that a success.  I'd still be sitting with a bunch of parts on my workbench if I didn't stumble across this DIY build tutorial.  Now I feel like I know enough to ask questions in this forum.  It feels good.

There is a article that does cover some basics very well it is a 3 part article like explaining batteries, gear ratios, KV.  All written by the Bearded Angel himself.  I know a majority (as I'm still reading through part 3) of all that stuff by now but it is so well written that some of the complexity that was on the threads here is taken out and put into the simplest term possible.  You should definitely read it as they are very informative.

I check for new articles every day, it really is funny and informative.

The only thing I wish could be different would be that fact that I have to keep up with 2 forums now, but I understand why it's separate from this one.

Hopefully it doesn't since this is about the "community" and growing it in a positive way.

There's no threats, blackmail, insults, or spam in my post. Just trying to help the ENTIRE community grow the way it should.

Same here but censorship is the antithesis of a public domain and to have strong views on that is a principle that should be upheld no matter the cost.  Content is shared here for the common good and not so one particular company can have a "structured forum" for their own gain.

The BMS in my son's board, Brad literally gave me for free.

And helped me learn what the hell a battery is.

Real community right there.  Without his support, I probably would have bailed long ago.

Thanks for the confidence man, I owe you.
