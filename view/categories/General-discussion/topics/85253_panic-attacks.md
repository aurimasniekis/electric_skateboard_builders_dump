Friends, in the past couple of weeks, I've suffered two major panic attacks upon waking up.
They started off with a feeling of dizziness.. which turned into my anxiety kicking in, and then the panic amped it up until my heart was beating so fast that I felt like I was either going to pass out or have a heart attack.

I'm "only" 33, and as a person who has never had any kind of major health issues, this kind of thing makes me feel awful, because I have a fear of hospitals on top of everything, having never really gotten used to them.

Luckily my roommate was home this morning, and he just kept me company and talked to me, which calmed me down. I was definitely ready to dial 911 though, in case something happened.

I have two things I want to do: figure out what made me feel dizzy both times, whether it was food-related, stress-related, etc., and also figure out a way to NOT panic, even if that stuff happens again.

I saw a very unhelpful doctor the first time, and got some anti-anxiety/stress/depression meds that don't seem to be doing anything.

Having a fear of going to sleep now is terrible.

When I called a friend to chat, she started asking me about what makes me happy, and to try to think of things related to that, in order to get my mind off of things. That's why I'm making this post here.

For two years now, I've been visiting this forum often multiple times a day. I'm obsessed with new tech, new builds, etc. It's become a very expensive and addicting hobby, as I'm sure you all understand. I don't post much, but I do read a lot.

I don't really have any real point to this post other than to write things down, be open about my anxiety and OWN it, and just say thank you for all the knowledge and cool pictures that keep me inspired.

I've had panic attacks before. Definitely not fun.

For me it was mostly from thinking about other people's expectations of me. So after removing a few people from my life things got a lot better.

Also, I always noticed a correlation between frequency and how regular my sleep schedule and good my diet was.

Years ago I had some scary heart irregularly I was very anxious about and it would snowball into more heart episodes.  I asked for anxiety meds and got buspar. It took a couple days if not longer to kick in but was pretty magical how anxiety would fade.  *worth reading the side effects and inability to ejaculate was one of them!! I found out the hard way

You definitely not alone with it.
3 years ago I had an irregular heart beating which took me about one year to get managed.
Shortly after I thought all is good I had a crazy heart beating which only stopped after they gave me some drugs and infusion in the hospital.
I still have small â€žpanicâ€œ attacks from time to time, but I learned to hold it under control as minimum for now I didnâ€™t need to go to hospital again.
If I look back I think there are some factors which have a big influence on how your body behaves.
Sleep is very important.
Sun light is very important.
A healthy lifestyle in general is very important.
And one of the most important things, find something that makes your mind relaxed.
Where you can take a break from the usual routine in your life. 
Idk in which situation you are, but if you on a point where you have a lot of important things to decide, or you think people expect a lot of you this can create a pressure which leads to attacks like this.
So in short, sleep, chill and donâ€™t mind what others might wait from you.
Find some way to get yourself under control.
Maybe some kind of breathing technique makes you calm an relax when you feel nervous.
Maybe meditation could help you too.
Relaxe Music, just be creative ðŸ˜‰

dude the same thing happened to me 2 years ago and it was bought on by dehydration.  Seriously I didnt think I was dehydrated nor was I badly in need of a drink in my mind but I went to hospital and thats what it was.  Funny thing is it took over 3 weeks of rehydrating to get my body back into balance.

Its a strange thing, and the more you think about it the worse it gets.  The most important thing is to get to the bottom of whats causing it as quick as you can because then you can solve that and get rid of the attacks.

I have pretty bad social anxiety. Most the time im fine or can at least push through the situation but sometimes i get really overwhelmed. Anxiety/panic attacks are just part of life for me at this point.
They had me on medications but im not big on pills being a permanent solution so i kicked those. 
Learning some meditation did far more than any medication. Highly recommend

I have been through this my brother, and 1 thing i was told buy my great aunty was we do not get the minerals that we need in our diets anymore. upping my Magnesium intake helped me out so much within a small space of time. look into it, make your own assessment. Keep strong bro and stay off the prescribed meds, they are the true devil in disguise!!!

You are definitely not alone.  I sleep like shit and have been dealing with PTSD ever since I got out of the army.

I was a medic and saw a lot of bad stuff.

Now it all manifests itself in the wildest and most unexpected ways.


What I am trying to say is you aren't alone and thank you for sharing.

I have definitely been through anxiety attacks. I have had anxiety since high school. I have seen shrinks and that didnâ€™t help. I understand your fear of hospitals cause I have the same. To me they are just gross places filled with sick and dying people.

I have a diagnosed fear of vomit but also have EOE which cause me to cough until I feel like Iâ€™m going to be sick and then itâ€™s all hell breaking loose.

I have found it helps to talk to someone about it or watching a funny movie or show to get through the anxiety. Step Brothers and Parks and Rec/ The Office are my go to.

@Powadangaboards is right. I also had panic attacks and irrational fears in the past. I went to a doctor and I was told that panic attacks can be triggered bc of a lack of minerals... Vitamin D, Magnesium and so on. Maybe a blood picture will help to determine it..

Will live in an age where our food is so processed that we no longer get the minerals we need to function with the stresses of life. https://www.amazon.co.uk/Magnesium-Effervescent-Mineral-Supplement-Tablets/dp/B073P5D7NC/ref=sr_1_1_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1551047369&sr=8-1&keywords=voost+magnesium

I touch wood, never had panic attacks. Only now how it feels when you're overexerting yourself (and lacking a lot of sleep while trying to keep pushing) and your heart starts beating like mad ; sure it is scary.

It's kind of you to reach here and share your feel man. Wish you to find a way to calm the attacks.

Panic attacks can be caused by a number of things, and I'm not a doctor so take this as personal anecdote. 

I have pretty much the opposite, I just hold stoic until I feel so detached I would welcome a panic attack to feel anything. 

I have severe ADHD. Not the "sorry you kid is stupid/lazy, here's some children's strength meth" kind.

I have the kind that constantly leaves me in two states: 

Like I have had Alzheimer's and cannot remember to do the most basic human tasks. 

Or I'm manically razor sharp focused on the one and only thing that will keep my attention until I've defeated or exhausted the problem. 

Being able to talk openly about this kind of stuff is the first step in getting a hold of it. This is something I must credit younger generations for attacking the stigma. 

I've been through every ADHD medication in the book and I hate feeling medicated to function. Nothing works long term, and they all just trade one set of problems for another. 

Go see a doctor if you can. Get blood work done. I avoid that shit but I went in about a year ago and got a full blood panel done. 

Despite eating a lot healthier than your average American I still had multiple vitamin deficiencies, vitamin D and iron specifically. 

And it turned out I was chronically dehydrated. 

This is going to be the dumbest PSA ever: DRINK MORE WATER. 

SERIOUSLY. You'd be amazed at how much it impacts you without knowing it. Nobody drinks enough fucking water.

I no longer take ADHD medication at all. The world didn't implode. I didn't lose my career. If anything I'm doing even better and have less stress. And I'm drinking water and exercising every single day, which is probably exactly why

Thank you guys so much for all the support and sharing. This means a lot to me. I was luckily able to go out and get some work done, and I'm with a friend at dinner right now. He's keeping me sane. Feels good to have people I can count on.

I still haven't read a couple PMs, but I wanna get back to everyone when I have more time and feel more relaxed.

Seriously, thank you!

I had panic attacks for a year or so, came with some paranoia and was almost certainly brought on by too much weed. I got them under control by stopping all illicit intake, eating well, getting into routines and doing positive affirmations. 

I can also recommend vervain tea to help settle your nervous system down. 

It was really shit and I feel for you mate. If you want to know any more please pm. 

On the plus side it all worked slowly to restore balance and the whole thing is 15 years in my past now.....

Sex. Most of u need to have more of it to sleep peacefully not a joke. Or start living ur life not just spectating or surviving it. All those things that cause anxiety is mostly from not experiencing them and making them a normal thing. The more u get used to the less u have to fear. U werent used to esk8n now u r. Think about it

As @DerelictRobot stated: drink more water.

Itâ€™s not just to hydrate you, it flushed your lymphatic system out, that shit holds all the crap that get filtered out of your body. Once you feel better physically, your emotions will follow too.

Seems new age hippy bullshit, but I swear by that shit now! I feel a huge difference in my mood if Iâ€™m just slightly dehydrated

I think the people before mentioned a lot of good things you can try. Sleep and eat better is definitely very important as well as drinking high quality water. Depending on where you live you might need to buy it unless you are lucky and have some natural springs with clean water near by. 

You said you where obsessed with new tech, builds, etc.. Take a step back and ask your self why. Being obsessed with anything is a sign of imbalance mostly on the emotional side. Be as honest as you can be with yourself but be gentle and don't judge yourself too hard.

Take your esk8 and ride in the nature as much as possible. Hack, just spend more time in nature and get away from artificial life. I guarantee things will take a quick spin for the better ;)

Actually so long as it's not plague water you will be fine.

Let's not be flagrant ninnies here. 

Nice try Nestle PR team, but people have been drinking water and mostly not dying from it for at least like, 10 years.

Unless you live in Flint. :confused:

I too suffer from panic attacks and ptsd. I actually used to work at a mental health facility in L.A. what helps me when im having one it to put my hands on a counter or something stationary while looking at myself in the mirror. And focusing only on controlling my breathing. I tell myself there is no rational explanation for how I feel and that it is all in my head. I hope this helps.

To sum it up, I was speaking with doctors about it and they said itâ€™s a pretty common thing with men in the age of 30-35.
Didnâ€™t said anything before as I was not sure if I can believe in it, but after I read more and more having this issues I think itâ€™s really a fact.
I canâ€™t speak for others but I definitely can say for me itâ€™s cause by mental stress and a kind of snowball effect when you experience a strange situation or feeling and start to think more and more about it. I also experience that it happens with me more in the end of winter. After 3-4 month without real day light Iâ€˜m kind a more easy affected.
I also canâ€™t agree that sex does have any influence on it, but what definitely helps is to know to have somebody on your side to calm you down.

Maybe what he is saying is you need to have sex in a crowded public place to fix your social anxiety... 

I have seen where sex reduce stress but stress and anxiety are to different things.  Stress can cause anxiety.  Because if that was the case I would have anxiety issues from the time I got up to the time I went to bed for the past month.  I have had that before and it sucks.

Go see a sleep specialist Dr. This sounds similar to sleep paralysis- your body rejects inputs to move when you are asleep, and just after you wake up you sometimes feel frozen in place. This is where the myths of incubus and succubus come from (nocturnal emissions are another mistaken sign). Worrying about it isn't likely to make it better. Try meditation. I hope you feel better. I don't think your troubles here are as rare as you think. Please don't sleep with weapons.

Hi, sorry to hear you are going through that.  I have experienced this as well its no fun...  Looks like many possible  solutions have been given.

I can only stress the importance of balance and face to face socializing.  It's easy to fall into an obbsessive pattern especially if you are passionate about something.

 My suggestions would be cut down on caffeine, be more social try to find a way to help and serve others (not online), community, family volunteering etc. Practice selflessness. Some form of spirituality is huge, prayer, meditation and yoga have been helpful for me.  Best of luck to you.

This thread got bigger than I thought it would! Sorry for the late reply. There was just so much to take in, and I really wanted to take the time to properly read every reply, and write my own when I was feeling ready.

It's been a fine balance of trying not to think about my anxiety too much, but also be as open about it as I can.

I've gotten much better over the past couple weeks, with some ups and downs. I'm currently taking Sertraline, which my doctor told me can take a few weeks to start kicking in, but whether it's the meds or just time, I'm slowly starting to feel better.

Sometimes I feel my anxiety start to creep up, but I can usually tell it to just go away, and it works. Sleeping is the biggest problem. I've always been a bad sleeper, and the panic attacks didn't help make anything better. I'm trying all kinds of things to help myself sleep better (less screen time, melatonin, etc), but I still need to find something that works for ME.

This is gonna get a little long, but I wanted to write even just a quick comment to every person who replied, as thanks :cupid:

@TowerCrisis Thank you for sharing. I admit it's definitely hard not to worry about what other people think of me.

@Hummie The Sertraline I'm taking has similar side effects written, but luckily they don't seem to be affecting me :slight_smile:

@Andy87 I think the sunlight thing is big for me. I always have my blinds open (even at night), and winter always gets me down. Basically, I think I just need to get outside more.

@BigBrit A couple people brought up the dehydration thing, so I've definitely been drinking more water recently, just in case. Can't go wrong with water!

@Skunk Yeah, I've had general anxiety for at least 10 years now. I'm just gonna have to learn to live with it... ideally minus the panic attacks.

@Powadangaboards I also started taking Magnesium, so we'll see where that takes me!

@Sender I don't think I could ever do any type of work related to hospitals. I can only imagine what your PTSD must be like. And thank you for sharing too.

@briman05 So far, talking to people has been the best medicine for me, I've found. Whether it's chatting with my online friends during a match of Apex Legends, geeking out about esk8 stuff here, or hanging out with my friends on Friday nights watching dumb YouTube videos.. it really does help.

@Mich21050 My doctor said he didn't think it sounded like I need any blood tests. But we'll see. I think I should get some done eventually.

@Vanarian Thanks for reaching out. Every reply in this thread helps, seriously.

@DerelictRobot The funny thing is so far I've talked to three different doctors (I need to find a family doctor, but haven't found one I liked yet), and all of them said it didn't sound like blood work was urgent. Having a fear of blood being taken, I'm not exactly in any rush if that's what they're telling me, but at the same time.. I sometimes feel like something else might be triggering my anxiety. Definitely drinking more water these days!

@amazingdave So far I've only tried lemon balm tea. I'll have to remember that one. It's the getting into routines thing that I think I need to work on more, especially regarding sleep.

@sk8l8r Thanks for being a part of the conversation (sounds like sarcasm while typing, but it's not, haha).

@Chrisjarram I've had a couple books recommended to me by friends. I haven't read any books in probably ten years or so, but maybe it's time I started again.

@Itsmedant Not only have I been drinking more water, but I've slowly been trying to eat/drink other healthy stuff, at my own pace. Even little things like buying only natural peanut butter now.. and buying Coke Zero (gross, but I got the cherry one at least), and only having that at home, while saving "regular" pop/soda for when I'm eating out. Baby steps.

@jerry373 I've been counting down the months until I can finally start riding again! The snow is just starting to melt here.. so the streets will probably be really wet and sandy for about another month or so, but it's coming soon!!

@badger4life And thank YOU for your reply! I'm in the same boat. It's made me feel really good to hear other peoples' stories and know that I'm not alone in this.

@BigZwatt I've been trying to find a breathing technique that works for me. I've found that TRYING to do some kind of special breathing in turn makes me frustrated and then anxious about it, haha. It's like my brain knows I'm trying to trick it into not being anxious. Stupid smart brain...

@starstuck8 That reminds me of the girl from The Haunting of Hill House. It's a good Netflix show, you should check it out. Anyway, I don't feel like I have any kind of sleep paralysis, but I do think that I might have to go see a sleep specialist, because my quality of sleep is very poor.

@Raincityeboarder Yeah, I'm trying to cut back on any evening caffeine, and to be more open and social (sometimes hard, being an introvert). I've only done yoga once, and felt like I was dying, haha. But my friend offered to teach me some easier yoga to start, and see if that helps me. I think I might do that.

You talked about yoga. I have never done it
But have heard it can be very helpful. As far as sleeping there is a tea called sleepy time tea it has camomile in it and has made helped me sleep. I had tried melatonin and it didnâ€™t work for me I slept but didnâ€™t have a good sleep. I have read that you can actually trick the brain into creating the enzymes they help you sleep deeper by starting to do big yawns that are forced and continue to do it for a bit and after a bit you wonâ€™t be forcing it and it will be a real yawn and then you will start to feel really tired.

I got sleepy time tea, but it didn't seem to affect me much. I'm a big guy though, so maybe I'll do a couple bags at once, or buy the non-bag kind so I can just put in however much I want and boil it.

I haven't exactly read everything... But I think I saw you haven't had blood work done yet. I absolutely fucking hate blood work. It reminds me of traumatic fucking shit, no matter what, and I can only guess it's going to stay that way for the next 10 years, as it now has for the past 10 years. That being said, because of current medical shit - I have to do it often, typically twice a month. 10 ish vials at a time too. Shit sucks ass, but it's important and can be very helpful. I recommend you do it ASAP. A lab should have absolutely no problem with you putting in headphones. Just do that and look away haha. 

Also, Melatonin is great. 300mcg, within the same 45 minute time gap, every night for a week, and you'll know if you're going to have great results with it. ALSO, 30-50mg zinc picolinate, along with 2mg of a copper supplement nightly, is really great for sleep as well. Crazy dreams with it, but I kinda enjoy them. 

Taking 10,000 IU of vit d-3 can't hurt anybody also. I'm pretty sure there's just a nationwide recommendation for everybody living in Canada to do so, just because lack of sun.

I don't want to push you off of meds that may be incredibly helpful in any way - but be careful with SSRI's. They can wreck your shit if you miss doses, and coming off of them is typically ultra shitty too.
