anyone using angled risers ?? if so what is the best positioning in your opinion.

Place it with the lower part on inside and increase the stability and loosen your trucks for curves 
or 
place it with the lower part on outside and thighten the trucks for stability?

I wedge my front truck and dewedge the back one. I think it helps with high speed stability, and I believe it helps with speed wobbles because the two trucks oscillate at different angles so they can't build of each other as much.
