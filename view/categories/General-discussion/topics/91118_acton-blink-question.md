anyone with an Acton

I had an Acton once upon a time. Literally taped the battery/esc onto a longboard. To be honest, their first single belt drive was actually "good". I got baited into the whole hub motor hype at the time and sent my board in for a belt to hub motor swap for $100. That hub broke within 1-2 miles of slow circling my office parking lot.

I contacted Acton about it and there was "nothing they can do" eventually a solution was reached where they gave me an Acton Lite and called it even. The Lite was cute, but useless for me unless I had one for each foot

Well the Quatro is a whole different level of board compared to their other stuff.

But still stupid thin urethane, and cheap remote. Braking is still a bit harsh, but I guess that's something one can get used to. If they are still in business and planning future eskates. I hope they use the new Chinese ESCs because 2018 seems to be when they finally got things running smoothly.
