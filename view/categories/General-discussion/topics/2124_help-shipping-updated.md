I'm trying to ship an entire eboard to someone in New York. I'm in Chicago. USPS just declined the package and mailed it back to my home. Can anyone recommend the best way to ship it? I've called all over and the hoops that I need to jump thru aren't getting me anywhere. 
The problem, of course is the battery

Have you tried FedEx? They can ship batteries I think.

I keep trying all 3 main ones. USPS ups and fedex. FedEx seems to be the most promising but does anyone have a clear cut way to send batteries? There is just so much fog on the subject. Even the employees can't give me a straight answer

Your gonna have a problem if there are lipos.... I think you can for example send 2 3s batteries but not one 6s battery ..... There's only fudging it to get it through...Aka...just put longboard on the box

Dude I'm dyin over here I tried to send an entire e board to someone who bought it from me. And it seems impossible to ship it. Problem is customer service and when I called the branch 2 days before they said it was all good to mail. I gotta go thru hell before I mail this thing

It's a 10 amp hour 6s battery. And yea I was thinking about that just sending the board but then I'd pay for shipping twice

Worst thing is if he has to procure a battery himself...and that ain't hard

You would have to ship it ground.. USPS would be your best bet.. I would just go in there and don't leave until the package is shipped.. yolo right? 

I would say fedex is ur next best shot.. Good luck and let me know what works for you..

I always ship my board from Orange County, CA to San Francisco using UPS Ground. I've never had any problems. I'm not sure if the regulations changed recently due to the f'ing hoverboard issues, though.

When I contacted liionwholesale they said the regulations were changing this week so that may be why

seems like they change every week. I just had somebody send me a space cell USPS ground. USPS told me they wouldn't touch them, which is  why i sent all the ones i shipped via FedEx Ground or Home Delivery(which is residential ground). 

I would get a FedEx account, print the label from online after selecting "batteries" under special services and Ground/Home Delivery as the shipping method, write "contains lithium batteries" on the box and just drop the whole board off at a FedEx facility. Usually you just walk in and lay it on the conveyor and walk out.  They wave and say thanks. This has been my experience anyway.

I've never had a problem shipping anything with a lithium battery using UPS ground. BUT, you have to take it to a main UPS shipping center, NOT a UPS Store or satellite center. Because only the main shipping centers will accept hazardous materials.

same with FedEx. It can't be a mail boxes etc or one of their tinier locations. I have to drive all the way across town to get to one i can send batteries from.

So i dropped the package off at UPS today and i had to call ahead of time to the hazardous material department.  The person i was speaking to told me to remove all labels from the battery and ship it via ground.  he told me that if i wanted to i could tell the clerk that there were batteries in it but it wasnt mandatory.  He took my name and said that if they give me a hard time to call him directly.  

Just to be safe i told the clerk and i asked the clerk to confirm with her manager they said its fine..  

2nd times the charm i hope

You have to go to the UPS Customer Center 
Not the UPS Store.
You tell them there is a lithium battery inside and they put a lithium warning label on the box. 
You should do a storage charge on lipos to ship them.  Don't ship them fully charged.

I sent out my chinese eboard though a UPS Customer Center on Monday with the label pre printed.  They didn't ask anything about lithium batteries.  It hasn't arrived at it's destination yet, but it seems like its going through transit just fine.

In case of difficult shipping instead of trying every single transport provider i usually post my item on http://clicktrans.com/ and wait for offers. It's more convinient. I shipped my board 2 times using transport provider found on clicktrans and I had never encountered any problems
