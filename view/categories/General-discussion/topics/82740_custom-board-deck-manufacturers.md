I don't think vendors who are earning their daily bread from selling parts would give out that information. Casual builders maybe.
Best bet is to look on alibaba.

Alibaba is the place to go if you want to do your own project.  There are some interesting decks on there already integrated top or bottom.  Most that I found were carbon fibre but I'm sure with some searching you can come up with something unique.  Most vendors on there will make what you want to.  The moq goes up considerably though as you might expect but if they already make something then you can usually get samples for a decent price.  Last year I bought 3 carbon integrated decks for $180 bucks a piece for science and they are pretty cool.

Thats where I first saw them.  Theres about three different companies in aus professing to have created a carbon masterpiece and low and behold....   10 mins on aliexpress and boom.  Its actually a very nicely built deck that is stable at speed and Its foam filled so is light as.  I've had that at 12s 4p and 10s4p with 6374 and hubs and its a great easy deck to base a build on.  Once you sort the orange dot out first lol.  That is where the receiver goes btw.  Gets round the drop out issues with carbon.  Point is you can find all sorts of stuff on the chinese market place if you try.

Described as their masterpiece.  Like they designed it and dragged it to the market instead of finding it on ali and marking it up 150%
Retails for 1999 aus.  Deck is the only redeeming feature.

And I was asking my self the same, and searching for a custome deck that I can order 50+ pieces, then I'll see on alibaba, the only problem I see there it's that not all the vendors are trusty. 

But i also need to buy the motors, want something like the bkb ones, do you think I'll find them there? I mean sealed motors, or waterproof?

A little harsh ... sololongboards.com is my site it's not representitive of what I do I can't even remember when I last logged on. Want to see what I do look on insta gram @sololongboards then take a look a slick revolution I designed the whole new range of decks including the all carbon half drop yet to bet shown. I don't preach what I do but most industry pros know who I am plus I try to stay off social media because it's a massive time suck...

I thought id have a poke at a community driven deck and enclosure so after 2 mins of deliberation i looked on the mold stack and thought what I could make quickly and relatively cheaply that would be superior to an off the shelf lash up. I have already pressed a blank and will make the enclosure plug when i get a mo then its up to ben to make it. The deck is 8 ply with 2 carbon fiber layers 97 cm long street shredder. The enclosure will have a flange but tidy flush fit and I will cnc a gasket ridge big enough for 12s 4p and the usual gubbins. Ill make this one and send it to whoever is willing to make it up in the name of progress. When the bugs are ironed out then ill take orders. The cost is in the material and finishing the less I have to do the cheaper it will be. If this style is not to everyone's liking a micro drop version would be done. Time scale as and when.

Eh, alot of people here (as in Psychotilelr, LHB, Hell I think I either see Sender or Dave through the esk8 hastag) interact on Insta, it's the best direct way to visually market a product , answer inquiries , and gain an expanding following, all in one application. Just because *YOU* don't doesn't mean the rest of us don't. It's one of the best way I see cool new companies, rides, and mods in the esk8 community out of the majority of esk8 media.

Quick update. The layup has 3.5 mm before the carbon so I can carve into the base and sink the flange flush. Could yawl come up with an affordable specification of parts to make it up then I'll ensure it all fits. Thinking start low and then people can jack it up. Sorry I cant layout with the with motors i have, all the gear I have is customers proprietary parts. This project anyone should be able to buy the bits and get a very capable esk8. This deck has a full concave so v comfortable and quite stiff. Nearly 600 grams of epoxy 8 ply 2 x 12k carbon fiber reinforcement so it's very sturdy and safe. The enclosure I want to keep it as low as possible however I can only sink it 3mm before we hit the carbon and it will fold. I'll do the tool paths tomorrow but I have paying work to do so may not get to cut it over the week end.![20190207_193457|281x500](upload://c2R62GsNAwLrNn3JwWybcCP6yxu.jpeg) ![20190207_192819|690x388](upload://dcmwQSummyFf36AIBcR77fxI2Vt.jpeg) ![20190207_192706|281x500](upload://kzcPNh3BGpI8ADCIZVbBNcjaNle.jpeg) ![20190207_192714|281x500](upload://ityp0ljk6IY25egTT04o67bngzu.jpeg) ![20190207_192638|281x500](upload://4FYdFHyqvMkJ4qt77mg6ATbKZtk.jpeg) ![20190207_192801|690x388](upload://n7MsMCa6YMGeuo8bU0a29RpZi9u.jpeg) ![20190207_192540|281x500](upload://b1hW9B93JwsxjQVuVaLYC2Qv9M2.jpeg) ![20190207_192617|281x500](upload://lPOygc5oJ8g2GfNkGQ21mZpTUoN.jpeg)
