I'm really excited to have found this forum. I've done a little poking around and I'm impressd with the lack of negativity. Good work admins! Also some great info as well. Besides just being a blast to ride, my intrest in E-longboards centers around speed. I think they deserve a place in the Guinness book. Are there any other menbers here currently interested in speed!

Thanks for letting me be part of this group!

I am, but i'd definitely want to have some better protective gear first. Just pads, gloves, and a half shell aren't going to cut it for that kind of thing. I'd want some leathers and a full face helmet. 

Fastest I've done was 31mph. That was scary, but there are people on this forum who have taken it over 40. I think the fastest electric skateboard did something like 55mph if i recall correctly. There are some videos on youtube about it.

Some of the boards on this forum are capable of just ridiculous speeds.

I hear ya, Ive gone about 35 and that was about all I would do on my current Board. I would like to beat the gravity powered record that is somewhere in the 80mph range. Fortunately I have all my old protective gear from my motorcycle racing days. I would be quite an investment otherwise. I think getting much over 50 will take some creative board designs to remain stable.

80 mph is so fast on a skateboard. I think the wind would just blow me right off haha. I did wreck my bike doing 80 in a corner and came out with just a bruised shoulder, so helmet, full leathers , kevlar gloves and some racing boots would be awesome.

i flew into the dirt once doing about 25. I'm lucky i didn't break anything. But when i broke my arm it was because i was going too slow and snagged on a crack. lol

My first eboard was geared to about 25 mph- I went out and rode it the *very first day* only to fall after getting the death wobble... lol, my knees are still scared over a year later.

I was just overconfident after riding normal board for so long, and living in florida with no hills, I hadn't ever gone anywhere near that speed. Now, with my current board I'm going 28mph with it limited to 80% power... and that feels super slow- Haha I guess I just got used to it and need to go faster!

That said, I think I'd kill myself though before hitting anywhere near 50... that's just insane to me. Maybe @longhairedboy will make a speed dedicated deck with his fancy new press :wink: :smile:

its already red, so it probably just needs a spoiler. Much like the color red, a spoiler can add another 20% performance boost.

So if i can make a red spoiler, i can add an additional 40% more power to this deck.

@CSN Whoah! flipping through their photos, here are some specs: hub motors made with brushless DC outrunners 4035 180KV made by "Scorpion", Tatuu batteries 6S 9000 mah 25c (not sure how many, one per wheel in a 4x4 config), quantum controller (ya the cheap one we've been discussing [over here][1] , I can't see what speed controller they're using.

the next gen board looks promising. With 4 wheel drive and hub motors, it won't be cheap though. My next build has already laid me back $900 and Its only a 2 wheel drive. another 2 and were looking at $1500 easily, So i bet that board will market for at least $3000.

This weekend i was talking to a friend who was encouraging me to try and organize an event in the Orlando, FL area. Sort of a time trials type event, maybe even racing (drag, head to head on a course, etc). I know you clowns would be interested so i'm going to start asking all of the questions of the locals in order to find a venue, permits, laws, insurances,  and all of that bullshit business stuff i hate so i can see some peeps bring their S classed boards down here to the sunshine state and tear up some 'crete.

I have. They seem decent. I like NGV's approach better though.

BTW, I asked them which speed controller they are using, and they said the Flycolor 100A 12S with custom firmware.

hello
i'm not interested in any records but i'll like to max my vanguard set up, already hit almost 46 mph <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/d/dd07b787081f9f58cb1f53dc25f5e499fe2c54be.png" width="281" height="499">
i order better bushings and will try to hit the 50 mph mark, the only negative thing is that speeds above 40 mph in a urban environment are not recommended for more than 30 sec ( at 50 mph 30s is 0.416 m or 0.667 km)

there's been a distinct lack of straightaways that aren't covered in branches and leaves around here lately. I'm hoping i can max out my build this weekend. Last weekend only saw around 25mph due to shit in the trail.

Max speed i hit was 33 ish mph. super unstable, my old board was not made for extreme speed! needless to say i wasnt ready for the speed, bailed and messed myself up for a week

Board was geared for max speed of 40 if i didnt weigh so much

if you're using pulleys and timing cables , easy !
just make gear ratio to maximum potential !
also use 110mm wheels or more . rather , use an all terrain solid rubber wheels size 200 mm with wider trucks over 250mm . maybe , just maybe you could break NGV's 100kmh record .

I don't want to discount anyone's achievements or crush anyone's dreams.
but a lot of the "high speed" GPS readouts I have seen on this forum are not all that valid. GPS dropouts can cause spikes and spurious readings. I like to try and cut out the peaks to give a more realistic view of speed.

for eg. on @Kaly 's graph there you can see the board many times is easily around the 25mph mark but shoots one peak to 45mph for a moment once. id hazard a guess at that peak being a little inaccurate. 

that being said. 25mph is still god damn fast!

I don't want to sound like I'm picking on you in particular @Kaly almost every GPS speed graph posted here has had the same sort of spurious data on it. I just chose yours because its here in this thread and easy to see.

Yeah there's a guy named Justin Morgan on Facebook. Think he's a rep for evolve USA. He's always posting up saying he does 46mph on his carbon a.t. same thing, just a spike on his timeline....I asked him twice to meet up so that we could race. Both times he talked a lot of shit while not even responding to my invite.

Just like any OFFICIAL records set for any speed event. To be able to be an official speed (event, record, claim) it has to be a two way average over a distance that is timed. SO lay out a distance on a flat safe area and do two way timed events over a few hundred meters.

I'm really not into records, but I like to ride a little fast when ever is safe to do it. 

About the GPS issues I can not tell, don't have any info on it, about the speed on that graphic can not tell 100 % but it was really fast and this is from somebody that drive a tractor trailer  and motorcycle for the last 18 years. 

In conclusion going too fast it's not safe even with all the precautions taken and is not essential to have MAJOR FUN on a eBoard :blush: 

So have fun and be safe guys. 
Let's not give the eBoard a bad rep. With any major injury.

too late, i already broke my arm last year. I was going slow when it happened, so you can bet i won't be going slow ever again. I learned my lesson. 

i need to find an old airport or something where i can really lay this thing out on the flats. Believe it or not, there are too many hills on the trails i frequent in order to do this properly. That's right, hills. In Florida. Nice ones, too. The best ones are covered in very busy four lane roads though. 

Range and commuter testing is better on these trails because of the "realness" of the course, but for speed testing we want unobstructed flats on straightaways with high visibility.

lol, my normal route to school here in sf involves predictable hills and a lot of flat ground with very good road conditions (besides lots of stones). So that's pretty ironic to hear you have hills and I don't as much. I know If my board was capable, 35-40 mph would be comfortable. I skate on my normal board faster then my eboard goes.

Reviving this thread, I'm curious to know almost half a year later...what are the highest speeds people have been able to attain with their builds?

Using iphone GPS apps Strava and Wahoo fitness, I have hit 37-38 mph as the peak speed on 4 different occasions while in full tuck.  This is above the calculated max theoretical speed for my custom board build by @longhairedboy.  (12s4p lith ion, 15/33 gear ratio, 83 mm wheels, 190 kv dual motors 6355 motors).  However as pointed out earlier in this thread, I'm not sure how accurate those apps are.  But it's also important to note that it isn't just isolated spikes, I have multiple ones in each ride close to the same speed.

http://i.imgur.com/3ancFgQ.png

That's two different GPS based apps showing similar max speeds, so are they really not accurate?  Using another GPS based app called Vidometer, which is a live GPS display I'm able to cruise at 32 mph while on max throttle and not in a tuck.  I doubt a tuck would add 6 mph?  Maybe 1-2 mph, but anyway...these are my results.

@Kaly I'd like to know if that 46 mph you posted was a repeatable result, and what set up you had to get to that speed.

Hi 
I have not try to repeat the speed run anymore. Shortly after that I decided to change battery chemistry to lifepo4. 

That run my set up was 
12S Lipo, 230kv dual motor, 18/40 pulley and 100mm mbs wheels.
