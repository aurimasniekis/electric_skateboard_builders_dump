LIVE! Except pre recorded for better, more live-like quality! This was a Hangouts session I participated in with @captainjez and Jay Boston and a guy named Rick and another dude (i'm sorry!) to talk about hubs and belts and gear drives and direct drives and things.  I think they may have even added extra  lag in post production to make it seem like you're still watching it live. It was fun.

So i thought I'd share. It's making its rounds on Facebook by now i'm sure, and i plan on doing a blog post on it later to provide more of my thoughts on the topic. 

@hummie your motors are in the pic but I accidentally grabbed a koowheel when somebody mentioned hubs instead of yours. I hope you can forgive me for such blatant treachery. Your hubs were actually just out of frame in the background. I should have set them on the bench with the carvons.

Can't say I agree with Jed board classifying as a direct Drive when it has a reduction ratio... Great discussion.

Correct. its not a direct drive. Its a gear drive. We have four known good systems now. 

I'm about to write a giant informative blog post. 

I'm actually pretty pumped about gear drives. I wouldn't mind going there.

Wouw, all I kept hearing from one guys was like like like like like. As a non nativ english speaker, is this a bad habit, area related or ?!
 
I mean like is it normal that you um like use "like" before every other word. like basically a filler when you um like don't know what to say, like....

its a filler that also happens to work in place of self confidence when searching for words.

allright, so exactly like our "ehhh..." in french :)
```

## \#22 Posted by: longhairedboy Posted at: 2017-12-20T23:52:48.384Z Reads: 80

yet for some reason when the french do it, it seems as if the speaker is somehow more sophisticated, more thoughtful. When an american does the "andum... and uh... errah... like..." we sound like the typical native buffoonery. 

Why is that?

that's actually fairly simpel, if I manage to explain it well enough. So lets call them fillers.
In french we don't use words mostly, it is an "ehh" / "Ã¨nnn" or  "uuee". So it is firstly not as noticable and obvious.
Secondly melody plays a huge part of that language, hence the amount of special characters. So a confident speaker, will fluently hold the rythm and the melody and subconciously choose the right filler if he needs a split second to continue. Giving the illusion of a continious monlogue. It also helps that the sounds are similar to most comon expressions so they feel nantural in use and hearing them.

English speakers who abuse like, destroy every rythm american english ever had. They add a word that doesn't fit within the context of the sentence since "like" as a word is actually well defined, so hearing it as a non native speaker confused the shit out of me. Why not use a sound or at least " well" / "emmm"/ "soo". Why like ?

so what you're saying is that if i for example, instead of speaking in a normal rhythm, simply rapped everything and, when confronted with the challenge of presenting a well articulated word choice started beat boxing and essentially "dropped the bass" when i found the words, people may be less off put by the interjection of a gap into my stream of consciousness.

haha man, 

well, If you were to listen to english speaker and only focus on rythm and melody you will often find that well articulated poeple go hand in hannd with the above mentioned.

Think of "like" as dropouts from your remote. Fucks the whole flow up. This flow is so much more important than one might think in spoken language.

the flow is filled with subconscious triggers, much like everything else we do. 

people only need to search when they're in unfamiliar territory. 

your brain wants to know why they're in unfamiliar territory, even if you don't care.

So back in the 80's there was this breed of females called Valley Girl. It was caused from an acid dropping experiment by the government that went wrong from the generation before. What your seeing is Valley Girl fallout. The son's and daughters of the Valley Girl, lost souls of syntax, like what ever. https://youtu.be/271ysXfAV9k
