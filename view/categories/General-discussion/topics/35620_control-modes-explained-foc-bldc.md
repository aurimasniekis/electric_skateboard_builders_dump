Hi please type in you experience with different types of controller modes such as ppm or the other apps in FOC or BLDC mode. Also if you have used duty cycle mode please detail your experience. I'm trying to figure out whats going on in each mode.

**TL;DS** (_Too Lazy, Didn't Search_)

BLDC = square wave

FOC = sine wave
