With warm weather right around the corner, I thought it'd be fun to make a new game to knit our **always loving** community even closer.

**RULES:**

1) Post a YouTube link to a song you love
2) Tag 2 people you require to listen to it the next time they skate
3) Tagged people tag 2 more and so on
4) No judgment on music style

I repeat. 
**You must first listen to it while skating if tagged**

No spoilers!

I'll kick it off weird

@DerelictRobot

@Itsmedant 

Song: Do Something Rhythmic

Artist: Pogo

I found it while watching this YouTube channel so enjoy the bonus video and that kids face

@venom121212 thanks for the suggestion. I fell asleep while riding and died. <3

@b264 this is what rap looks like outside of ICP. 

@SeanHacker hey buddy, in case you needed to hear whatever I'm usually blasting out of my crotchal region speaker again.

@venom121212 I rode, I listened, I made opinions and thoughts but then just ignored them and kept riding!

It was a fun song for a nice jaunty cruise....but when I wanted more throttle I had to find something faster!!!

@mmaner have you still not skated? Or have you just forgotten about my song?!

Agreed, it's not one of my favorites on my skate playlist but I thought it was just too appropriate of a video to pass up for you :smiley:

I'll do better next round

Its from a game actually. This type of music is categorized under 'eurobeat'. Popular eurobeats are from Initial D and D8.

It died because your music is shit

(Full disclosure, I didn't listen to any of it, this is an educated assumption based on your face)

It's still on my TODO list. I was just on a vacation for a week and when I got back home I found the long awaited supply of MCUs in the mail so now I have a bunch of DAVEgas to assemble. Plus, my new Unity arrived that I need to install. No time for riding!

Well, Colombian Rap is more collaborative, like tropical reggaeton, but there are no hood tragedies, violence, drugs or gangs, and sounds bit different...

I finally found the time to do some riding and listen to @mmaner's tune. It's not what I would normally listen to, but I liked it for riding. It kinda made me go faster. :slight_smile:

Now, let's try something different. This is one of my favorites tunes.

@rich @Andy87 You guys do some drifting while listening to Drifting.
