unless I am mistaken its not 35mph its 20mph?

I'm wrong about the 35 mph, it says you can not ride on roads with speed limits higher than 35 mph.

But I'm not sure if the definition is met with that 20 mph speed limit. It defines the device as having a propulsion system of 1000 watts or less, however, most electric skateboards are much higher than 1000 watts. The board 
I'm working on runs at 2250 watts (the carvON dual drive), so then, it doesn't really fit the definition. Either way, I think I'll be fine, as I live in San Francisco, and the police here rarely care about these kinds of things. Technically, all skateboards, motorized or not, are illegal in San Francisco. I've had 2 tickets in the last 4 years for skateboarding, and my first 3 years here, my main method of transportation (besides the occasional bus or train) was my skateboard. So the chances of a ticket are rare to begin with and these laws do nothing to legalize electric skateboards in San Francisco, as the law clearly says that local governments can still ban them.

313.5. An “electrically motorized 
board” is any wheeled device that has a floorboard designed to be stood 
upon when riding that is not greater than 60 inches deep and 18 inches 
wide, is designed to transport only one person,
						and has **an electric propulsion system averaging less than 1,000** 
**watts**, the maximum speed of which, when powered solely by a propulsion 
system on a paved level surface, is no more than 20 miles per hour. The 
device may be designed to also be powered by human propulsion.

Its actually a terrible law. It says a motorized skateboard is not the same as an electrically motorized board. While giving a definition of an electrically motorized skateboard, it provides no definition of what a motorized skateboard is or where this is define in any other law.

So motorized skateboards are reaffirmed as illegal in this law, but an electrically motorized board is legal.

Also, the speed limit is set to 15 mph.

A person shall not operate an electrically motorized board upon a 
highway, bikeway, or any other public bicycle path, sidewalk, or trail, 
at a speed in excess of 15 miles per hour

The other issue is, my board does not meet the requirements of an electrically motorized board, as it goes faster then 20 mph and runs at a higher power then 1000 watts. So is it then a motorized skateboard? The law is too vague to ever know.

[/quote]

this is where the vagueness you describe comes into play. "Averaging".... what does averaging mean here? like if i have multiple motors you take the average of the two? Or (and this is the more accepted belief) does it mean the actual "average" wattage usage? In the case of actual wattage average you will probably never find a board that will average over 700... most are sitting around 400 last I checked. See... by saying average we are suddenly no longer talking about the wattage label of the motor, as the wattage label of the motor(s) is in by no way an average. 

It has been discussed elsewhere, I would have to find it, but I looked into it for a few hours as I too board here in the san fran bay area. Basically since our boards never pull over 400 watts you just bull crap the cop and tell him its a 400 watt board, well under the 1000 required. Secondly I am almost 100% certain that its 20mph as top speed, and then a 15mph top speed on sidewalks. Feel free to correct me on either of those points if your research says otherwise. I would not mind being corrected in the interest of safety.

---rant incoming---
at the end of the day its a law put into place by some politicians that had no idea what the heck they were even talking about when saying wattage. When you really start breaking down how the law works, its not a system of justice its a system of traps. As long as we are smarter than the people trying to rule over us, and aware of what we are doing, there would be no reason for a cop to pull us over. If pulled over he would be easily fooled by any hint of knowledge in the topic. Its all a game.

under section 21294, it says:

**(b) A person shall not** 
**operate an electrically motorized board upon a highway, bikeway, or any** 
**other public bicycle path, sidewalk, or trail, at a speed in excess of** 
**15 miles per hour.**

To me, it seems to set the speed limit every wheres but your own property to 15 mph. If its 15 in the street (all streets are highways in laws), sidewalk, bikeway or trail, that's just about all public space.

Again, it's not going to stop me from going faster. As you probably know, cops here in sf only care about anything when they see people being reckless. So if your going 30 mph for example, I doubt most cops will say anything unless they see you riding in a reckless and dangerous manner.

The law was sponsored by the representative from Riverbank, CA where Zboard is located - they basically got this law passed - the law fits the Zboard's specs:  400w, 15mph top speed...

The specifics might apply to a court of law but realistically lots of laws are on the books and rarely enforced unless someone is acting irresponsible or acting overly entitled.

For example it's illegal in many states to listen to the radio while driving.

The 15 mph limit on bike paths is probably not to endanger or irritate other trail users.

Cyclists and pedestrians have much more influence on laws than E boarders due to their numbers.

If a few entitled DB's are ticking off other users then we might see a lot of bans in California municipalities.

I like the idea of trying to change the board to meet a different requirement, though I have yet to find the definition of a motorized board (which I know refers to the loud, polluting, gas powered skateboards). I need to see that definition in order to see if there's something that can be done to change the board so it no longer meets that definition, because right now, we are not using electrically motorized boards (because most boards are capable of going over 20 mph) in the eyes of the California government.

Those bikers too, they fly. I've almost toke one out on market at the bottom of the hill after octavia (if your heading towards downtown). Some guy doing well over 30 went by my right, while I had my right turn signal on.

And that's what sucks about this law. Its ok for bikes to go as fast as they want and do dangerous things like that but its not ok to go 16 mph on an electric skateboard.

if the police are out there with radar guns they will likely be citing or warning all users for speeding.

There are a few places in California where cyclists can get speeding tickets.

Mt. Tam and Flume Trail at Lake Tahoe are two I am aware of. Pretty rare though. Usually just on nice busy weekends.

I doubt they are going to clock a cyclist at 30 and do nothing and then yank over an E boarder for going 16 and write a ticket.

Not saying it couldn't happen but seems unlikely.

One reason i use the paved bike trails instead of bike lanes on streets or sidewalks when riding for fun (other than not having to deal with idiots in cars) is because in my area there are a whole lot of very serious cyclists going very fast in herds. People walking dogs or out for a jog already know that somebody (or a large group of somebodies) is about to blast past them doing about 30 on a $5000 bicycle anyway, so they're already looking for it. 

all of those trails are marked at 15mph. No serious cyclist goes that slow. Pushing on my gravity i can maintain 15mph for some distance on the flats and i sure as hell get up past there on the down slopes. But on my electric, even when doing about 25 or so, i still get passed up by that herd of cyclists. 

i've never seen anyone enforcing anything on these trails, i'm assuming they are out of site and out of mind for any traffic patrols, and also i think they are treated like state parks in a way where they just have people in yard trucks emptying trash and clearing the trail and that's the only attention they pay to it.

I have stayed out of this conversation because. 
a) I'm in Australia where all motorized skateboards are illegal.
and
b) I really hate this topic.

but here I go...

I really hate this topic. I also have a few electric bikes and the Law topic comes up similarly with them. in my area you are allowed to have up to 250W motor on a bike, but skateboards with motors are strictly prohibited.
I understand the need for laws. I also understand that I am always breaking the law when I skate.
do I care? yes, no, maybe, I dunno.
I'm going to keep skating anyway.
If I get busted I will acknowledge the fact that I am breaking the law albeit a stupid one.  Im guessing the law is there to stop idiots from mowing down pedestrians on an over powered death board.
however when I skate, I try to be polite and give people right of way, slow down around children and dogs etc..
and I feel, that as long as I am not being a total dick on my skateboard I would have to find a Cop that has had a hell of a bad day and piss him off somewhat in order for him to book me.

TLDR: I know theres laws.. but there is also common sense. be safe and polite people.

Venting here!
I just paid a $239- cell phone summons yesterday (first time offense) NJ just raised all cell tickets to $200-300 1st offense, $400-600 2nd offense and third offense $600-800 with 6 month license suspension + court costs. All because I left my f*#$%^g Bluetooth in my other truck. Wonder if I'll also get pulled over for being on the phone while riding my e-board to work after my third offense. 
KICKER- I saw three uniformed police officers in marked cars on their phones on my way home (not on Bluetooth BTW). 
Thankful that he was decent though, got off on my tint.

I agree that the no texting or talking while driving laws are stupid.

The other new law that's pissing me off right now is the FAA thinking they have the authority to demand that I register my drones.

I think the bigger issue with all of this technology is that our law makers have no clue how to regulate this technology (as they don't understand the technology), and as a result, you end up with fear mongering and misinformation about the dangers of new technology. With the guidance of a few who stand to profit from new regulations, new regulations which make little to no sense for those in the industry/hobby are passed.

When a lawmaker is misinformed, they make stupid and hasty decisions that produce these stupid laws.

- Giving tickets to people of use cellphones while driving makes the road no safer, as now those people will text with there head looking down instead of texting with the road in the background.

- Making people register drones makes no one safer, as the people already breaking the rules will not comply, making it impossible to track the abusers down.

- Limiting the speed, power, and where one can ride an electric skateboard does nothing to make one safer, as these laws might ban one from riding where it is safe, forcing one into unsafe roads. Yes, 35 mph roads seem ok, if you can go 25 mph, but limiting the speed limit to 15 mph means cars will be going by me at 45 mph, 3 times my speed limit.

In the end, these potential "issues could be curbed with other efforts.

- For texting, work with bluetooth companies to create better bluetooth devices, which give you the full ability to control any aspect of your phone hands free. Market these as an advancement in society, and people will flock to them (for the same reason people ditched landline phones for cellphones)

- For drones, create a micro-TCAS (traffic collision avoidance system), create a way for these drone to show up on radar with altitude and course information, and a communication channel for traffic controllers to communicate to drone pilots. These would insure public safety, while this mandatory registration (which is also a tax, as you have to pay to register) does nothing to protect anyone.

- For electric skateboards, come up with different classifications for electric skateboards, class II or higher requiring special licensing and inspection to prove they are safe. This brings safety, while making me go 15 while cars go 45 around me does not make anyone (especially me) any safer.

You're being asked to put tail numbers on your drones because ass hats keep crashing into stadiums, little kids, and helicopters. Every day i read another article about another drone crashing into something it was never supposed to be anywhere near. When they aren't doing that, they're flying over people's properties and getting boob shots. Some of them are even being shot down and the shooters are winning the law suits. 

Meanwhile the other 99% of drone enthusiasts are going out to open fields or other good areas and having fun and not bothering anyone. 

What worries me regarding esk8s is all these damned commercial companies putting shit chinese boards into the hands of the unwashed masses. We, the boutique and garage makers and prototypers and enthusiasts, are going to suffer for it. 

Some eboard asshat is going to run over a kid and then we'll start to see signs *specifically* banning our rigs instead of signs *somewhat vaguely* banning our rigs. 

then we're screwed.

Does anyone remember when blank tapes were sold? Now they sell blank CDs, DVDs, and Blu-rays. What do you think those are for? Nothing legal, I can assure you. Oh sure, "backups and other legitimate purposes". 

We copied music and made mix tapes. We burned movies from Netflix, and now we're torrenting shit.  People smoke weed all over the place, buy illegal weapons, keep weird animals like tigers and cobras, tear out the exhaust treatment systems on their cars, and text while driving. 

We will also skate regardless.

ATC guys don't have the time to mess around with 100's of drones randomly popping up on the radar screen. That is a terrible idea. (I'm a certified tower operator with radar experience + pilot).  99% of drone fliers don't know how to read sectional charts that show the airspace limits in their area. Registration is more about making people accountable. As a RC guy myself, I fully support registration.

My local trails just updated the laws on electric bikes. Speed limit is still 15 but you can ride an electric bike up to a certain amount of watts. They say nothing about skateboards (motorized or not). I should be in the clear for a while. I have never seen a cop on the trails to enforce the speed limits (they aren't allowed to use radar anyways). Like everyone else has said, the bike guys ride full blast all the time. I almost get clipped daily in the summer by some. I don't think anyone will pay any attention to me when they have those guys to worry about.

Of course they don't have time, but I'm pointing out that the FAA, in trappys' case at least, said that model aircraft, including drones, are real aircraft, and should be held to the same standards as regular aircraft.

How will registration hold anyone accountable? The only way they will find out your not registered is if you crash your drone, and if you didn't register, they will never find the owner. People simply won't register, as the chance of being caught are slim to none for not registering (I know I won't be registering).

Not to mention, according to the FAA Modernization and Reform Act, “the Federal Aviation Administration may not promulgate any rule or regulation regarding a model aircraft”, which will be used as a defense if someone is caught violating this new "policy" as the FAA calls it.

At the end of the day, there are bigger fish to fry here. You know very weel as an ATC that there is a shortage of ATCs. That poses a bigger risk to public safety then a drone, which has never crashed into a manned air craft.

There's also been complaints lately of so many drones by Golden Gate Bridge. I myself have taken videos and photos there. However, I see no mention about the helicopter tours which take people UNDER the bridge, coming very close to hitting the bridge, which would kill hundreds to a thousands of people.

At the end of the days, this comes down to more government intrusion into our privacy and racketeering (estimated 1 mil in drones this holiday season will be sold and $5 a piece, as this will be most peoples first and only drone, means $5 million in the pockets of the FAA this year alone).

Am I going to have to register my stove now? or how about my dryer? those could cause fires and pose a risk to safety. Where does this draconian law end?

This is sort of sliding off topic with all the drone talk, and we need to bring it back. but i will say this:

It doesn't matter what it is. Drone, skateboard, electric bike. When it flies out of control and hits a kid, irrational legislation is going to happen. "Think of the children!" they will all shout in unison as they attempt to govern things they know nothing about. If an electric skateboard could fly out from under my feet and interfere with a heart transplant helicopter, you better believe we'd all have tail numbers on our single kicks. 

Eventually we're going to have to register our PEVs. Just like we're going to have to register our drones. Why? Ass hats and knee jerk reactions to ass hats. 

But in the meantime we get to enjoy the fact that most states have no idea how to classify electric skateboards and don't pay any attention to them in the big picture. California is one notable exception because much of the commercial esk8 industry is there and commercial industry drives legislation, so much much more attention is being brought to the topic there. Cali leads the way in so many ways, so this isn't surprising. 

The laws as written in Florida, which is sort of the east coast, gun toting, bible thumping, less productive and racist version of  Cali, vary in ambiguity from reader to reader. Allegedly esk8s fall under a certain class of vehicle by default, not by definition or decision. But cops have their hands full with Florida Man and flakka, so zero enforcement.  

I'm no prophet, just a cynic. but i predict all hell's going to break loose here  in Flalala when some kid on an eboard gets beat up or shot by the cops because they don't like his skin tone. It will draw the wrong kind of attention, and very negative discussions will be had, and very negative laws will result. We sort of have a serious problem with systemic racism here.

Agreed, there will always be this kind of reaction when new technology causes a problem. And I think your right. You know, originally, I bought one of those pistol grip controllers, thinking its smaller than the rest. The issue is, it looks too close to a gun, and with the trigger happy police we have in this country, I can see someone getting shot for holding a controller that looks too close to a gun, so I decided to get a bright orange controller instead. There' no way a cop can claim my controller looks like a gun. But it might happen to someone else.

BTW, I think most people racist to some degree, as I can't imagine there hasn't been a time in ones life where they blamed something which happened to them to the stereotypical behavior associated with a race. But that's a little off topic, so I'll leave it at that.

A ban on the use of electric skateboards on roads and footpaths in South Australia prompts a call for parents to rethink their Christmas shopping list.

In an earlier post lowguido has advised all states make electric skateboards illegal. At the end of the day if your being carefull with the surrounding users its jyst going to be bad luck you get fined by police. They have better things to do. Jus a shame its so regulated because idiots will try and ride in the middle of roads etc.

but yeah in Australia once it has a motor on it its illegal. I don't hold high hopes of that changing any time soon.

I kinda hoped that the spate of so called "hoverboards" might entice someone into creating some more relevant laws, but it would appear all the bad press and spontaneous combustion has just drawn more unwanted attention to the electric propulsion community, and will probably cause some vigilante cops to start targeting us.

i'll continue to skate, but try and stay stealth... cant wait for my hub motors.

I think we will have more trouble with idiots riding on the sidewalks blasting past old ladies and clipping children.  All a matter of perspective. Here in New Mexico things are much more relaxed. I just wave to the sheriff and smile as I pass him doing 35mph.

You are not allowed to use motorised skateboards, roller skates or roller blades on public roads, footpaths or nature strips. But, you can use these on private property.

Here in NYC things may be a little different where there are more important things to do. CaseyNeistat posts a video riding right up to officers and asking if they are illegal. One even says its not a priority. LOL

i'm thinking about getting a petition started in my area to formally allow electric skateboards anywhere a road bicycle is allowed. Similar overall speed, lane footprint, and terrain requirements means it makes sense on paper, but people get real hung up on the word "motor" due to the misuse of the word motor in the  phrase "motorized vehicle" which is meant to apply to things with gasoline engines and EVs like golf carts which hog the whole lane and inconvenience everybody. They also like to get worked up over the word "lithium" for obvious reasons. 

But i think it would be worth it to at least raise awareness. We aren't going anywhere, and this isn't some fad that will disappear by next year. Walmart is selling electric razors and even cheap electric skateboards, and the internet if filling up with these things.

Totally agree with LHB.  The law needs to catch up. If I put some front and rear lights on my board and stay within a carefull speed around pedestrians I should be able to ride on paths. Even on roads as long as I obey road rules and where a helmet. Its not the case yet. The law doesnt kniw what to do with these things. 

Im checking with my police officer mate so am sure he will say the same as NYPD guys that they have better things to do. Everytime they issue a fine it creates more paper work for them. You would just have caught a cop on a bad day I think if you were fined here in Aus.

Not a final determination from mate yet, but if considered as an unregistered motor vehicle it carries around a $780 fine. I dont like how the Vic Road general rules say that its not even allowed on footpaths. They may consider it as a motorised scooter, but they dont actually specifically define it or put it with them. Going to have to go deeper. Not sure whether they can just include it under scooters unless its defined as such.

Two of my best friends are cops and while both had heard that electric skateboards are now legal, neither knew what the legal speed limit was. 

Living here in California, specifically Los Angeles area, about 1/3 of the people walking or cruising down the beach bike paths are smoking pot (2/3s in Venice), cops aren't checking for medical marijuana cards...ever. I doubt I'll get much if any grief about an eboard as long as I'm not doing anything that could endanger others. 

My 13yr old son has a 1000w scooter that tops out about 25mph...he went flying past a cop car on the street while we we're headed to the beach a couple weekends ago...cop didn't bat an eye.

I've been pulled over twice in the last 3 weeks here in San Francisco.  I was told I'm not a car by a cop at the stop light the first time (can't argue with that but I think he meant I should move over further). The second time the officer told me it was illegal to ride a skateboard on the road. I told her it was legal now and she asked me what the legal code was and I'll have to remember it now. Write it on my board 

The wattage max..are they talking watts in or watts out because that'd be a big difference. 

If ever there was a vehicle that is a danger to one's self way more than anyone else it'd be a skateboard.
But I'm surprised they allow them on the sidewalks though. I thought even regular boards weren't allowed on sidewalks.  I kinda wish they were illegal on the sidewalk because that's where some Walker is going to get hurt by someone and I never ride on the sidewalk.

Surprised to hear about getting pulled over twice, were you keeping pace with the traffic around you? Clearly cops aren't quite sure what to make of eboards yet.

I agree that riding an eboard on a sidewalk feels a little inappropriate, but it does limit an eboard as a potential commuter. Some roads you just can't ride on regardless of speed limit.

It's a small world.  My neighbor honest to goodness just told me he was moving there 2 minute ago.  I like it there. A little island away from it all.  


After looking at the law again I'm overwhelmed thinking I'll wear my bike helmet and get a light.  I can respect the light law and I should be wearing my bike helmet.

Personally I am trying to legalized / check / categorize where my eBoard could be legally be used in open street within The Netherlands and see if it's EU allowed. I have been in contact with RDW which is a private test facility where people check their vehicle / manufacturer testing facility to see if a vehicle meets EU regulation.

Sent them an email and this is what their reply to me:

---

In late 2010, the Ministry of Infrastructure and the Environment in the Road Traffic Law 1994 in Article 20b a new category introduced special mopeds. These include to Segway-like vehicles. For this, no European approval shall be required. (Staatsblad (Official Gazette), No. 744). In the Netherlands these vehicles can not be registered. The Minister pointed these vehicles.

What is a special moped?
Special moped: moped as defined in Article 1, first paragraph, section e, under d of the Law for which an application for designation under Article 20b of the Law has been submitted to the Minister;

This is Article 1, first paragraph, section e under d of the law.
http://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0006622/HoofdstukIIA/Artikel20b/geldigheidsdatum_29-01-2016

Article 20b (Google Translation in English)


Prior to admission to the traffic on the road Our Minister may a motor vehicle with a maximum design speed not exceeding 25 km / h, equipped with an internal combustion engine with a cylinder capacity not exceeding 50 cm 3 or an electric motor with a maximum continuous rated power does not exceed 4 kW, not being a disabled vehicle, designate a type or individual on the grounds of his safety if:

a. the authorization corresponds to in Article 2, paragraphs a and b, second paragraph and third paragraph, subparagraph a , above purposes; and

b. there been realized rules is required for this vehicle is not in accordance with a type approval in the framework of the European Union.

A ministerial regulation further rules may be adopted concerning the designation.

The next steps isn't so clear to me at the moment, so I am contacting them for further info! But I am excited if my eBoard could be categorized as special mopeds which means that is legally ride-able in The Netherlands.

If they let you classify it as such then you can ride around slowly when the cops are around, 25kph, and legally have a 5kilowatt board. That'd be better than our law with the lower wattage max.  At 4kw continuous maybe you'd have 6000 peak maybe and if you get in a good tuck or not you should be able to hit 80mph maybe?!  I still wonder about all this power rating though, are they measuring in or out, I'm guessing in, and even then they'd have to know your voltage and escs and motor's continuous rating, and that info I don't trust hobbyking as the source and I doubt your police would be searching hobbyking's motor stat bull or seeing how big your heatsink is on your vesc

True, but if you don't do anything to cause a nuisance or safety hazard to others then the police will in all likelihood leave you alone.  I can speak from both sides of the law. Not only have I been riding e-boards for 2 years in Victoria but I am also a cop!

technically in Australia all motorized skateboards are prohibited. that <250W thing only applies to bicycles.

edit: i just checked the rules in VIC and apparently you can have an electric scooter or skateboard under 200W.. 
hopefully other states follow that step in the right direction..

upon closer inspection it says "motorized scooter" but you could almost bend a skateboard into the definition ;)

> What is a motorised scooter?

> A motorised scooter:

> has the same features as a foot scooter 
> is moved by pushing one foot against the ground, by an electric motor, or by a combination of both
> has an electric motor with a maximum power output of 200 watts or fewer
> is not able to travel faster than 10 km/h when ridden on level ground.
> Your motorised scooter is classed as a motor vehicle if it:

> is powered by a petrol motor 
> has a maximum power of more than 200 watts
> can go faster than 10 km/h.

also having said that, most of our skateboards go faster then 10km/h :P

maybe i'll just go with illegal again.
