Decided to give dying the 77a blue cags a shot and they turned out great.

Full tutorial:

1. Gather materials, I used Rit synthetic graphite, dish soap, vinegar, large stainless pot, water.
![image|690x408](upload://8b2q8ftUD8VApIyNFG5RPrz0UB5.jpeg) 

2. Fill up the pot with water so that your wheels are just barely fully covered. 

3. Bring water to a gentle boil and then turn off the heat. 

4. Add one cup of vinegar, a small squeeze of dish soap, and an entire bottle of 7oz synthetic dye and stir together.

5. Add your wheels and stir for 10 minutes.

6. Let sit in the hot water for an additional 30 minutes.

7. Dump the black water out and add regular water to the pot, repeat until the water is clear (this is just to get rid of the dye and clean the wheels).

8. Remove and dry off your new kick ass black wheels!

Do you let it sit in boiling water for 30 minutes in step 6.? 
And do you bring the new water up to a boil and sit for 30 again in step 7.?

No, I turned the stove off before adding the wheels and stirring :slight_smile:

Beautiful. Nice job. Definitely gonna try this on some Abecs. I think they would sell a ton more Caguamas if they were this color from the factory.

Yea, I'm gonna stir it once every 5 mins because the part of the wheel that contacts the pot will absorb lesser dye, then take it out and rinse when its a full hour. OP said 30 mins but i like to be safe. Nothing can go wrong if i leave it too long right?

I did notice that if the wheels have urethane bubbles, the dye might not seep in there and it remains blue. Oh well, but its black all around!

but the dye is just on the surface i think. When you ride them the tread will turn back to blue perhaps. Or am i wrong?

We'll have to find out when i ride these. But probably won't be anytime soon cus i don't have a build to hook these up to. Maybe @huntercasillas would have some insight as he probably has them up and riding.

iirc it goes just beneath the surface, it won't wear off too quick I don't think unless you are doing burnouts.

That could look really cool when the outside of the wheels start to reveal the color again. I'm excited to see how these turn out in a few months.

For thiis build it would be amazing if you could use the motor tube anyhow to get the other wheel moved with the same motor. Is there something similar out there?

Just thinking, could you save the black dye water, bottle it up and use it again to top up the colour a couple of months later when they start wear out?

But does that outweigh how much dye was just taken out by those wheels? I think not but I say try it for science. You can anyways re-dye them darker!

Whatever happens let the dye set, don't get cold feet and back out because your hair will go purple and you'll have to sheepishly go down to a convenience store and buy black dye and do-over. And then later on that week you'll visit your grandparents, who already hate you because you're not a suck up cocksmoker like your older brother, so they'll tell the whole rest of the family that you dyed your hair because you're a satan worshipper now and eventually you'll just shave yourself bald because every morning when you look in the mirror you'll see your blonde hair growing through underneath like some kind of fucking reverse 90s fred durst and hate your life.

Totally didn't happen to me guys
