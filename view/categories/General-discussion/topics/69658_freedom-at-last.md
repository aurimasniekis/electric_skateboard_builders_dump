Pretty happy how this turned out. I’ve been unable to fulfill on all those ideas simply because a lot of it interferes with brand. Now that i’m out, I can renew that focus on dropping equipment people want.

Basically sold the company when I got a pretty decent offer for it. Wanted to pursue other designs/projects that were simply not possible while I ran that company, so I saw the offer as a chance to start fresh and cut myself loose of any beaurecatic shackles. Simple as that, really.

Best of luck. I'm enjoying your up-spec'ed GB motors/esc/remote. Looking forward to see what you do next.
