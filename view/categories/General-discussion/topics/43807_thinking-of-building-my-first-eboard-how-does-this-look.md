As the title says, this would be my first build. Me and a friend, who has built a board, have quickly put together a list of the parts I plan on using. The main focuses of this board would be:
* Decent range
* Decent speed
* An easily upgradeable platform for the future

Again, this is my first board so I'm probably making some mistakes as even my friend who helped me barely got his working. All I ask is that you help me. Thanks in advance. 

Also I really hope the html table worked

Isnt it more econimical for you to order from www.alienpowersystem.com? They are based in UK and have similar motors to DIY in my opinion and a good reputation. They also have a lot of other esk8 stuff you might want to check them out if you have not already. Because if your package gets stopped by customs you will have to pay a lot, VAT+import fees.

I think that you won't need the st-link programmer. the VESC will probably have a bootloader on it already.

If the Vesc has a bootloader then you can just connect the VESC to your pc via mini usb.

It depents a bit on the amount of batteries you are going to put in series, but if you have 2 in series (22,2 V nominal) you would have a kind of low top speed with your 190 KV (rpm/v) motor. 22,2*190= 4200 rpm. 

http://calc.esk8.it/ is a very useful site to see what your board will be capable of!

To be clear, higher voltage is more efficient...nit necessarily better for a vesc as there is less voltage delivery. Regardless if the "studies" I've been running a vesc in 6s for iber a year and it's stood up at lease as well as my 10s boards. Though the lack of speed sucks ‚ò∫Ô∏è.

I make custom packs.

Do you have any idea of the configuration of the pack you want? 10S4P is a popular choice, or maybe 8S?

IMO its better for the Vesc to run 9s compared to 6s.. At 33v you Aren't really pushing the voltage "limit". As the standard Vesc's only can take 27? Amps (Which is little) countinous. And with 6s you will (in theory) pull 50% more current,- compared to 9s.

it's the never ending conundrum, save money now and pay more later, or take the pain up front and save some cash down the line. It's always hard to make that call :slight_smile:

Another factor just to add to your confusion - most 18650 packs are not going to be allowed on a plane, but lipo packs can be pulled out of the board and taken hand luggage.

@DavidBanner So can you make custom packs? I'm in the UK and considering a spot welder but would prefer someone to make them instead.

MrMidJit, i'd recommend a 18650 battery pack over LiPo, it's technically safer and can be built to spec. Unless you want the absolute maximum capacity for the space, or superior discharge capability.....or ease of purchase and implementation.

Also check here for a FOCBOX instead of a Vesc, i don't yet have one but according to posts here it's better. And these are already in the UK, so no customs

Just going to point out that the linked BMS is only for 6S packs and is only 10 A discharge max, which IMO is nowhere near enough. You're either going to cook your BMS or it's going to constantly keep cutting-off, because you're going over the current limit.

I would have also pointed out that the single 3S Zippy battery is not not compatible with the BMS in question, but seems you have other inquiries in that area already.

@DavidBanner awesome, I'm looking for a 10s6p or 4p, however I'm looking at 3d printing 2~3 individual battery boxes, and having everything kind of modular.
I don't want to hijack this thread though, so I'll PM you regarding this.

Taken your guys suggestions for an updated parts list, Changed some of the parts to come from a UK supplier, made sure the stuff that is coming from a non-UK supplier can be delivered and decided to go for a 6s LiPo battery (for now) and upgrade to a Li-Ion in the future. I plan on bypassing the BMS for discharge. Is there anything else obvious that I am missing or something obvious i'm overlooking?
