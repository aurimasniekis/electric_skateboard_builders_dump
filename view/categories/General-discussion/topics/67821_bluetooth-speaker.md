So I have tried many Bluetooth speakers while I ride and while in an enclosed room they all sound great I just can't hear any of them as I ride until now.

I got the UE Boom2 speaker
![1200|353x499](upload://a4pYrqV2q6VPjin60cts0JUnb10.jpg)

I hook it to my backpack and just ride it last all day and is super loud so you can hear it as you ride and so can people around you. 

What speakers do you guys use?

I use a JBL flip 4, of all the speakers I‚Äôve tested before buying, it was the best sounding

Hook it up to the straps of my backpack in the front, this way is easy to change volume and skip/pause

Wish I could bring my bedroom sound system on the board, but a 1,8m tall subwoofer is not really portable

In before "People that use speakers while riding are disrespectful" blah blah blah.

To those who may complain: At minimum your going 10 mph and you can always turn it down when you stop at a light. Fuck up. 

Now to answer the question, I use 2 JBL Clip 2 (not 3) and use their daisy chain feature to link them together. I eventually wan to get ont of the bigger JBL's

I have the same speaker except mine is blue.  I do the same as you.  My buddies and I enjoy the tunes as we ride.

HAHA!  I expect folks on here or anywhere to say it.  I try to be very respectful because I am running with a speaker.  Therefore, I have a specific playlist I run, mostly old school hip-hop/R&B(clean), little 80's as if I am in a GTA mission, 90's rock, and some MJ & Prince...why, because I am a grown ass man.  I listen to what the hell I want.

IMO listening to music while walking/biking etc makes you look like a dousch bag unless your going 30mph and pass everyone fast

except skiing because listening to edm while bombing hills pumps your adrenaline by 5 points and its cool to see

Its ok if your on some festival or something like that, but there's lots of UK people who come to a festival here to rave and snort cocaine on an island really close to me and then they come to the old city core and blast music on their UE Booms acting bad ass and doing shit.
makes me want to punch them in the face

To that point, I really wanted to try the Boose sound wear, they say it focus most of the sound on you and the reviews say it sound great, unfortunately too expensive

Also only use the speaker when riding outside the city

I actually use bluetooth ear buds on bike trails and mute them if I have to ride on streets.  Been doing it since I got the board in January and never had a problem.  Just gotta keep the volume down so I can hear bikers bitch at me when I pass them.

LOL... just pictured, Some guy blasting EDM on a bluetooth speaker while riding an esk8 doing a line of coke!  That would be some Charlie Sheen type shit.

On another note, I could care less what someone thinks about me while I am riding.  Hell as if people don't already think you are a douchebag for riding an esk8.  ALTHOUGH, I just thought of a new song to my playlist.... Pusherman by Curtis Mayfield.  That shit might be my theme song as I get on my board!

Ah it's random people, so many people have over done stereo systems in there car down in the southern part of the US, some of these guys have to run 2 or 3 alternators to power their set ups.

Lol, thats cool but the sound quality is pretty bad i guess since its a car :smiley:

My friend bought a 6kW sound system for his band and it arrived 2 days ago literally his whole house was shaking on 50% we couldn't be inside and we are really noise tolerant

Its just attention seeking, same as idiots with loud exhausts. Wear headphones like respectful people. It also sounds better and protects your ears. (if you get the right shaped ones) 30mph is loud.

Headphones are a terrible suggestion, unless your underlying suggestion is death.

Please dont condone headphones while riding @danielz , hearing is a very important sensory system when one rides a longboard at high speeds, especially one that is powered. @808Chopz, sweet! We're basically neighbors üòÉ

Just like you shouldn't drive with headphones on you shouldn't ride with headphones on. Imo it's okay to play music as long as it's not any louder then a car stereo and it's not.

I'm not really into blasting music out of a speaker while you ride but a friend had one of these flip's a few weeks ago out camping and it was so much better than everyone else's speakers, amazing little thing.

Yeah, what I like about them is that is really balanced, if you look at measurements the response is unbelievable flat, when most other speakers have some part of the frequency range missing or over boosted, they can sound good for a few minutes, but after that becomes fatiguing

So I got a new Red Boom 3 speaker for christmas. I have to say it produces insane sounds especially if you hook them up in stereo mode.
