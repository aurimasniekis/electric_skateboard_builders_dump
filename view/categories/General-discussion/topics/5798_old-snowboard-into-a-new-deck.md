So someone gave me a kids size snowboard...

I was thinking of chopping it down into a longboard


Good idea...bad idea?

Anyone ever try it?

It's not a bad idea at all, you can still do trick with it.

Well I'm planning to cut it down to a shorter size to help reduce the sag ... Not sure how short it needs to be so I don't have worry abt the enclosure scrapping the ground....

So I'm guessing it will need to be short or I need to add a support to give it some stiffness

This is the a üëÜüèª snowboard that someone cut ... I'll need to make it this shape to avoid cutting out wheel wells like the dude above  in the video

@Michaelinvegas Haha, great minds think alike. I've been toying with this idea off and on for about a month or two, but haven't decided whether it's worth the trouble. I didn't even think about the kids board. You could always put the enclosure on top...

I made a longboard out of a winterstick snowboard about 15 years ago. It's still going strong, I cut it into a long oval shape with a jigsaw. 
Very flexy though for an electric build.

How long did you make it @bigben ? The one in the picture seems very short.

Mine is 45 inches nose to tail. I'm probably 200lbs and is a nice cruiser board but certainly too flexible for a lectric deck.

If I remember rightly the insert width was perfect for drilling straight through to put the first two bolts in.

Nice @bigben

Yeah looks like I'll need to shorten it up or figure out something to stiffen it up

```
@Michaelinvegas Get some square steel tubing from the hardware store and bolt it to the board along the bottom edges like a grab rail.

I was thinking of a similar idea , Im at the snow at the moment and in my lodge there all these 90s skis.

Hey dudes,  @lowGuido and @Chris_KP,  can you please stop posting those bloody snow sports pictures.  Summer has finally arrived here in Switzerland with temperatures of 30 degrees Celsius after months and month with rain and I would like to stay focused.  

And if you don't stop you will feel my revenge when I dig out some old pictures... Now that should worry you!!!

@lowGuido if I remember correctly that little patch of snow is not that small.  I skied  Thredbo,  Falls Creek and crazy Mt.  Buller.  Looong time ago.  Still have very fond memories.  

@Chris_KP,  sure,  fully aware.  Tuesday will be 21 degrees,  and this is our summer...  

Actually I just wanted to start a war in order to get an excuse to post some pictures...
