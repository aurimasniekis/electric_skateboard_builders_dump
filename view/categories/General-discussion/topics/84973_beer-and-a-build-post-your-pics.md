dude...

This is what you need... a Beer and Loathing
https://youtu.be/DaMuEkAzN_A

Recipe in the description ;)

I love IPAs... so a pils seems weird. but man.. beer and bourbon 😍 its an exquisite explosion of flavors from the grapefruit, cynar with 13 herbs, and hoppy pils, its reminiscent of the layers of flavors in hops, but summery and refreshing.

Dude @Sender I love me some arrogant bastard ale.

I swear though the older I get the less I drink and the more I smoke. Hard to deal with hangovers with my type of work load. 

I have gotten really into Sour beer now and wiskey. Many many craft breweries here in South Florida but I could only find one distillery I may consider getting into the wiskey business haha.

It's super fun, we do tend to get a bit crazy but we're pretty safe for the most part.

It's always fun to look at peoples faces in their car when you pass them in a 30mph zone haha

Lmk when ever you want to come down we will make sure to get a good group ride in.

We have the DC and NY crew coming to ride with us within the next 2 months.

I also heard of the Orlando crew thinking about doing something with us too.
