Hello there! 

My name is Jake De Necochea. I am the Engineering Marketing Intern at the Northern California Grow Manufacturing Initiative (GMI). My job is to help connect advanced manufacturers to educators in order to train a skilled workforce for the future of manufacturing. I have been asked to create a presentation for junior high and high school students about my esk8 board, the engineering practices I used, constraints, versions, problems, and the future of my board. 

I wanted to get input from the community as to what should be included in this presentation. While this is more about inspiring kids about what you can do with engineering, I also want to bring awareness to the hobby. 

I use this board as my primary mode of transportion, so I am constantly upgrading and innovating. It is used to solve a problem, which is why it is being used in the presentation. 

So, in terms of education, what is important? At the presentation, should I allow kids to ride the board? What sort of visuals should I implement? 

Thanks in advance!

[/quote]

Esc's for SURE! Also motors, switches, batteries, and mechanics.

[/quote]

I would say no just because it's very dangerous for those who can't ride(roast me brothas :wink:) and your board is probably illegal too :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:. But you can show them you riding it. :grin:

I planned on all of that, but I think describing how everything works would be a great idea. 

They aren't actually illegal in california, as long as it doesn't go over 20mph and has headlights, tail lights, and reflectors on the side. I plan to conform to everything except speed soon :joy:

I think it's important to make it not to complex but make sure they understand the basics :) Maybe you could use [the guide](https://electricboardsolutions.com/blogs/building-an-esk8) I wrote :)

You should try explain the electronics with the water analogy. Easier for younglings to understand 

Battery = bottle of water. High discharge = 1 litre bottle with big cap, low discharge = wine bottle 

Current = amount of water passing through 
Voltage = water pressure 
Resistance = tight neck or pipe restricting water flow 
Switch = valve 

Motor = water wheel, more pressure (voltage) = more speed. More water (current) = more torque. Low kv = big water wheel, high kv = small water wheel
```

Current, I flow that.

I fully Disagree with what you've said about scooters being safe and longboards Unstable. Here is something me and @Deckoz wrote up about the scooters and longboards,
![hjhj|690x377](upload://qnKwyDoVvT86n32KIFuFghXXHqo.jpg)
[quote="Blitz, post:11, topic:49038"]
when you fall on your side on a bike your hand and head can fall on its side alone makeing impact harder on 1 spot.

1.1.when you fall on your Longboard you have more control over your fall you can roll it out or worse case slide it out.

1.A.  saving a speed wobble on a longboard you can tuck and focus your weight on the front trucks. You cannot focus your weight on a scooter with handle bars in the way as you cannot tuck.

1.B longboards offer the ability to change your center of gravity, as well as create more leverage and grip on the road to keep you on the board and in control. Scooters offer a fixed position handle that does not move. If you lower your body your arms are still up high trying to steer. Crashing like this is asking for shoulder injuries.

The kids on scooters think Helmets are uncool but the Longboard community strongly encourages wearing helmets and protective gear.

This is so true. Also the difference between skateboarders and longboarders. Helmets aren't even a question when it comes to longboarding

That does make a lot of sense actually. I will change that. Are scooters more stable than long boards though? There really isn't much opportunity for speed wobble in a scooter as far as I can tell.

I like that idea. I explained how the motor works using a cat chasing its tail.

Tail=magnetic fields created by stator coils
Head=magnets in rotor

If you let go of the scooter handles your wheel will make you fly off somewhere, And if you fall from standing position Like holding scooter handles you will have a bigger impact on the ground. these are just some things that are easy to explain. Don't want to get into the whole topic of how longboard trucks are stable across 4 wheels speed wobbles only occur when riding loose etc.

And why write "smaller wheels=less torque required" I mean Lower gearing, lower motor KV = more Torque, 
It seems like a desperate attempt to seem smart,

Its not a desperate attempt, the rest is explained later. That was one of the main factors in the decision before even starting research on motors and all that, so I thought it necessary to put it there. I changed the electric vehicles slide to match more with what you are saying.

cool dude, Like your build its just like mine just I got 9s higher amperage cells. oh and 25mph+ more like 23mph  ( if you use the keda 190kv.).what 8s lipos will you use? If there like 20c then you'll get voltage sag uphill.

Thanks! I plan to use Li-Ion cells (10s?p) in the future, and larger wheels for more speed. I use 20c right now. Not many hills in my area, so I opted for the cheaper option right now. DEFINITELY gonna upgrade in the future for that reason.

I plan to do a full build log at some point, just need to get my new vesc... shorted the phase wires...

The DRV or whatever drive chip outputs waves into the 3 phase wires of the motor syncing up the electromagnetic forcefields from the stator with the magnets in the rotor. More on that here:

You need more visuals in your presentation. Make a build/assembly video of your board. Make a video of you riding it. Take some actions shots to inspire the kids. Show some videos of electric mountain boards as suspension trucks usually blow peoples minds. 

Remember that kids get easily board so you gotta show them fun things in between the science or else they will just disconnect from the presentation.

Harder/tighter is more stable correct, but It has less Turning radius.
softer/Looser less Stable correct but the turn radius is bigger.

No, you said looser = smaller Turning Radius that's wrong
What do you think "turn Radios" means? 
radius ˈreɪdɪəs/Submit  noun
1.
a straight line from the centre to the circumference of a circle or sphere.

Just think can a loose spring turn easier than a tight spring?

Treat the electric skateboard as a system, and proceed to break it down into its components and sub-components, describing their functionality as you go.

Electric Skateboard
- Deck (wood/carbonfiber, griptape)
- Traditional Mechanical 
--Trucks (baseplate, hangar, kingpin, bushings)
--Wheel Assemblies (Wheels, bearings, spacers, speedrings)
- Electromechanical
--Power Supply (batteries, BMS, loopkey/e-switch)
--Speed Controller (ESC)
--Human Interface (Remote, receiver)
--Drivetrain (Trucks Mount, Motor Mount, Motor, Motor Pulley, Wheel Pulley, Timing Belt)
- Summary - Describe how all of the subsystems work together

I want to make it understandable to a younger crowd with no background in engineering, but also make it advanced enough so the people with that background don't get bored. The goal is to generate more interest in manufacturing and technology, and using a product I made to fix a real world problem is a perfect way to do that.

I know it's hard to catch the attention of kids, so i would try to do some sort of brainstorming in the beginning on what they think you need to electrify a skateboard. Involve them right from the start.

They will probably get the fundamentals like battery and motor, maybe even think about remote and stuff. From there on you could build on that and as questions like "how to get the power of the motor to the wheels?" and segway to transmission systems (hubs, gears, belts, chains). Or "What's important in a remote?" to also speak about basic telemetry stuff.

Maybe don't get too much into the theory of what exactly the VESC does to spin the motor, many of them won't have any background in electronics and it will seem very abstract to them. At least that's what i find when talking to younger people about my boards. Maybe be a bit like popular science and compare the specs of a 1500$ boosted board with a DIY Board in this price range, or put together components for a boosted equivalent board for half that price.
And also don't forget to illustrate things like power transmission, ideally some sort of animation for it.

I think the most important thing is to show them that it's not just "slapping a motor on a skateboard", but instead many different systems and electronics working together as one. That you need careful planning for each detail during the build, but that exactly this is the rewarding experience you get when building a board.

Anyways these are my quick 2 cents about this. I think the goal should not be to teach them how exactly an eboard is built - they forget the technical details in a few minutes after the presentation if they don't already have a particular interest in the topic already.. But what they will take away is the philosophy of engineering and building stuff yourself and how cool esk8 in general is :D

i’m your target audience btw.

bring up things they know about (casey neistat, tesla, etc), and if at all possible, bring something hands on, (flip your board upside down, limit duty cycle and let them spin up the motor). every slide needs atleast 1 picture, find the cleanest looking boards you can find on here (I recommend @whitepony, @Eboosted, @Nowind)

make it as interactive as humanly possible

Great ideas. Have you had time to ask people what they would want to know? I like the idea of making it relatable, especially with Casey. I definitely am gonna bring the board and let them spin motor, and I will ride it a bit. I think RC cars might be relatable to some people too.

TBH I am pretty close to the target audience too, I'm only 19. I just have a big background in engineering. That's why I am the one presenting, to show what kids can do at their age. I will have to ask permission to use their pictures probably, but that's a great idea!

if you really want to make it relatable, you can put a pic of one of my boards in, cause i’m not gonna lie, 5 years seems like a lifetime away. if you could add something that someone exactly their age or younger built it’d probably be a huge motivator to build one themselves

most of the people i’ve asked just said they’d like to have a brief overview of each component (battery, esc, motor, drivetrain). they also said not to make it ultra complex and in depth, just a VERY basic overview so they could do the rest if they really were interested

I don't think you should mention the exact parts you use, such as "keda 190kv motor" and "VESC." For an audience with absolutely no background in this sort of stuff, your "parts list" will fly right over their head. Instead, explain how a VESC or just an ESC in general works, and and how you match the motor you use with the battery and ESC's outputs. You could even implement a little math, such as calculating your lipos continuous output (ah * c rating), just to show that there is math involved in building these things. Explain how a BLDC motor works, in simple terms of course. Maybe even have one slide showing a basic wiring diagram, and explain each component?

While explaining what excat parts you use does help those who would like to build their own know what to look for, it does not educate. Best of luck man! So cool you are doing this. My dad is a 6th grade math teacher, and I've been thinking about doing something similar to excited kids and let them know that math does have a purpose, and you can do awesome things with it!

Exactly what I was thinking honestly, I have changed a lot of the slides to match what people are saying. Feel free to use my presentation if you want! I will save it right now so you can take a look at the changes if you want. 

DEFINITELY implementing math into it now. Math is super important, this would be a great way to show why!

Question- why have almost half a slide dedicated to an antispark loop key? If I were the audience, I would not understand why or what even you are talking about. Why is there a spark? What is a loop key? Instead, just say you turn the board on and off by breaking the circuit, and explain why that turns the board off/on.

Just in general, begin to put yourself in the shoes of those who have no idea what any of this stuff means. That's what I tend to get in the mindset of when explaining or teaching anything new to someone:) again, looking good!

You'r always rude, it helps no one ... You can say the same things in an other way to inspire someone instead of irritating them and pull them down ... But it's probably because you're a 10th grader ...

@e.board_solutions @GrecoMan @Blitz

Guy's come on. This is for a professional presentation. While I SERIOUSLY appreciate the advice and input you have given to this presentation, this bickering between each other getting annoying. You are all able to build something that most adults can't understand. Act like it. The entire point of this forum is to inspire innovation in the hobby. Making snarky comments, giving destructive criticism, and insulting are not gonna help anyone. All it does is clog up the forums and make it harder for people to access the information they need.

Mini rant done. But seriously, if you want to attack each other do it over PM.

Again, greatly appreciate the input, but for the benefit of everyone around, please take the bickering elsewhere

Just trying to put a stop to it before it completely erupts :wink: I know you didn't say much, but still provoking other people isn't gonna help anything. Thank you for not doing that!

I appreciate the professionalism and work ethic you're upholding. Unfortunately forums tend to devolve into a "your mom" circle jerk.

Now for some new perspective about this presentation:

Manufacturing a reliable board. It's a bitch. I would know because that's 90% of the work cut out for my company. If you really want to get technical, I suggest ltalking about the struggle and politics one must wade through to proper manufacture a single board in large quantities.

Thanks! I do my best! I've noticed that, although this forum tends to be fairly professional from what I noticed. 

Agreed, I am getting frustrated with it. But I have learned that the faster I fail, the faster I fix problems and the board improves. 

What kind of politics are you talking about? I have talked about the struggles a bit toward the end with the "versions," but it would be interesting to talk about the politics to the older crowd.

Ahh, you are just focusing on a personal build rather than actual manufacturing. Never mind. Carry on.

The goal is to show kids what they can do with engineering at their age. So manufacturing, just dumbed down a bit. If you wouldn't mind though, could you PM me about the politics? I am actually really interested in hearing about that.
