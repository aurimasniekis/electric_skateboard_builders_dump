So I'm staying in London (UK) for a few months and wondering if it's worth me bringing my board when I go home, I've been here for 1 day and have already seen 3 (I had never seen another eboarder before). Just wondering if it's worth the hassle of bringing it up, like are the police good about it or are they super strict? Are there any really good places for it? Are the roads horrible to be on? Thanks guys :slight_smile:

If you're on facebook it's worth doing a search for some groups. There seems to be a very active scene in london. Esk8 uk and uk esk8 are two groups.
