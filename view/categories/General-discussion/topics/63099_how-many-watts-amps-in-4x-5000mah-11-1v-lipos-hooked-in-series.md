So I have 4 of these https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B07594LWWS/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 

So I have 4 of them hooked in series and I can't figure out how many Amps and Watts they output. Thank you in advance for your help!

```
4 x 11.1v (3.7v per cell) = 44.4v (3s x 4 = 12s)
5000mah = 5ah 
5ah x 50.4v (4.2v per cell) = 252 Watt hours

5ah * 50c = 250a
5ah * 100c = 500a
250 amps continuous
500 amps burst

Thank you so much Cryo! And one more thing, so I will be using this vesc https://www.enertionboards.com/electric-skateboard-parts/FOCBOX-programmable-brushless-motor-controller/

and its rated for 60amps continuous so is my 4xlipos in series too much cuz i will only using one of these motors collections/electric-skateboard-starter-collection/products/electric-skateboard-motor-6374-190kv. And when I hook four of them in series than to a parallel connector it reads about 24v im not sure if it became 10000mah and 6s or its still the same.

This equation does not give true current capability of Lipo batteries.

Take a look at these True Spec Lipos.
They give the true current capability of their Lipos.

5400/90C is 135a continuous

I'm just going off of formulas off google search and it seems c rating * ah = amp draw is the consensus. 

I agree manufacturers tend to inflate the c rating a lot but without OPs battery in hand to test, we'll never know

Edit: actually, looking back at it now https://www.smc-racing.net/index.php?route=product/product&path=67_99&product_id=463 
this confuses me. are they saying their 90c batteries are 85 amps continuous? If so, doesn't that just mean they are misrepresenting the C rating of their batteries? Because every website I've visited has agreed that (c rating) * (mah/1000) = (cont. amp draw) so instead of mentioning 90c it would just be 20c...

That depends on the load. A few factors affect how much current you'll draw such as your weight, going up a hill, throttle, etc. 

What I can say for sure is you'll be drawing less amps with the 12s battery setup rather than 6s2p, But if you go 12s, using a 190kv motor might put you over the vescs erpm limit. If going with the 6s, i would maybe recommend a higher kv motor.

See
https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/choosing-the-right-motor-kv-for-the-vesc/3125

That being said, 250 amps is just the theoretical max amp draw your battery is capable of, real world usage you will likely never even hit 100...

SMC isnâ€™t inflating their C rating. 
They are showing that AH x C does not give true current capability. 
I used to think that my 5ah 60C batteries would handle 300a cont. 
but then I saw how that they have some voltage sag with only 20-30a draw and I realized that the equation was incorrect.

Why? How to understand which is right or not?
How about the hobbyking lipos? The rating is there also not right?

The formula of AH x C = current is not right. 
It doesnâ€™t give a true answer. 
This is the case with all Lipos. 
That is why SMC states the true current capability of their Lipos.

I don't understand, I thought that hooking 4 of them in series would equal to 12s and 44.4V but it stays 5000mah so how 6s is more amps and it becomes 10000mah and about 22.2V right?

I donâ€™t like this c-rating declaration...
Just wonder why smc just donâ€™t write there max amp???
There c rating totally over the top.
You said the formula ah x c = amp is wrong, but how than all companies define there declared c rating?
What would you recommend is a good point to start with. If to look again to the hobbyking lipos which most common here I guess.
Letâ€™s say 6s 4000mah 65c would be after the old formula 240a constant.
So in real life i can take from this the half, 130a and this would be the real max constant current? ðŸ¤”

```
In series the volts add up
In parallel the amps and ah add up
With 6s you still have 5000mah
But if you run 6s2p than itâ€™s 10000mah and 22volts

You can make a 6s2p out of this 4packs
Just set up 2packs in series, twice and connect them than parallel

I just read again through your post.
Donâ€™t understand right whatâ€™s your problem in the end. The batteries you chose for sure able to handle the 60a the focbox can handle.
Doesnâ€™t matter if you run 12s or 6s.
The weak point in this case is your focbox.
If you planed to order the 190kV Motor, than stay with it. 12s 190kv should give you a good speed.
Just donâ€™t forget to set your max battery current to 50a (60a should be fine too if airflow is good around your focbox) and your max erpm to 
+-60 000
```

---
## \#23 Posted by: Toohat Posted at: 2018-07-28T21:09:05.090Z Reads: 45

so 12s 44.4V would be more speed and 6s2p would me less speed but longer range?

One additional explanation as I think you got it wrong.
Your batteries just give what your focbox and your comand by the remote ask for.
So letâ€™s say your max current of your focbox is 60a and you pull your trigger on the remote and go up a hill with your 130kg ðŸ˜œ(just for example...donâ€™t know your weight) your batteries will need to deliver 60a.

It depends on your motor kV, the gearing and the wheel diameter. 
You can calculate everything here:
http://calc.esk8.it/#{"batt-type-lipo":0,"batt-cells":12,"motor-kv":170,"system-efficiency":85,"motor-pulley-teeth":9,"wheel-pulley-teeth":40,"wheel-size":200}|

If you used the calculator which I linked you than yes. Just make sure you looked the weighted speed. For my set up it was pretty close to the real values. If you run single motor it can be that you need a bit longer to reach top speed, but in general itâ€™s really good template

Depends on your ride stil.
If I remember right than I had about 11wh per km for one motor on dual, so 22wh per km. 
You have 12*4,2=50,4 *5ah =252wh 
So about 12km with dual motors and flat area.
In your case could be a bit more as it is only single motor

```
There shouldnâ€™t be so much difference.
Itâ€™s still the same energy stored in your batteries.
But I think itâ€™s analog to a car.
To drive 200km/h will bring you not the same way like you drive 80km/h but also not the double.
I think it will be not more then 2km more.
If you ride economic with 12s it can even bring you the same.

Welcome!
If you interested in your data I can just recommend you to get a Bluetooth module. You can get them very cheap like 2â‚¬ on AliExpress and there are some good apps with which you can record your rides. It will show you directly which is the best set up for your needs.

I run 5ah 60C Lipos. They are adequate for a street board. Voltage sag is only about 1/2 v off total pack voltage when accelerating on flat ground.
For a mountain board or a street board with larger than 90mm wheels, I would try to get some 90C or higher.

You want to have as much headroom as possible to reduce voltage sag and battery heat.

What I forgot to say, if you put your lipos in parallel, take care that they mach with the voltage. I donâ€™t have experience yet but as iâ€˜m also planning to buy some I started to look for information.
In series itâ€™s not so big problem but in parallel you can for example over discharge one if they donâ€™t match. It can even blow them up. So better safe than sorryðŸ˜‰

Depends on the capacity. 2s2p 8000mah 30c (16ah 10s) delivers more than enough for a dual set to 60A, even for steep off-road hill climbs (mine last 5 minutes). Never had them overheat or suffer from severe sag.

```
If your using five 2s2p 8ah/30C Lipo packs, 
Thatâ€™s 10s 8ah not 16ah
A 2s2p 8ah pack will have four 4ah cells, not four 8ah cells. 
A 10s/8ah/30C  is going to have sag even on a street board. 
You might not notice voltage sag while riding. 
You have to monitor your battery with a voltage meter while riding to see it.
My 10s/5a/60C sags about 1V  going up steep hills with 90mm wheels and 15/40 gears. 

Voltage sag will affect performance a little but it will affect range even more.
