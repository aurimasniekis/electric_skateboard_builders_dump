Sold. Was gonna go with the eskating.eu switch, but yours looks MUCH more beefy.

Overkill is underrated right?

I'm moving in a month, so ship quick cause I couldn't remember the address of my new place. :smile:

@nuttyjeff Ah sorry, I believe the free stuff in the package compensates it quite a bit :wink:
@marsrover001 thank you! 
@Eboosted Thank you, I'm very grateful for that, this post is from yesterday, your order was 3 weeks ago, it's not like I posted this minutes after.. :sweat_smile:

Yeah I know I was just messing around :wink:

Besides those switches are the best on the market so I don't care about pricing

@Frenchy Code works again, sorry, it expired indeed too early today.
Shipping to Canada takes 4-8 business days.
