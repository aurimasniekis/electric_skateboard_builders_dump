deck wise if you want slightly shorter,
a misfortune is a shorter narrower fortune 33.5 x 9.25 inches with a 24.75 inch skateboard wheelbase
a loaded truncated tesseract is 33 x 9.5 inches with a 26 inch skateboard wheelbase...

neither have a flat base, but both are awesome decks.

hi5ber have a narrow/smaller DH deck the rebel but it is still 35 inches...

I'd go with the trucated tesseract, I'm thinking of adding one to my quiver...

but for length it is 2 inches longer than the Loaded Truncated Tesseract and the wheel base is 3.5 inches shorter?

in the comp. of bolt holes closest to nose & tail the trunc. tess. wins no?

(& 9.25 width is just too narrow for me)

Truncated is only 1 inch shorter than the brightside(34"). But you can drill the front and tail for more wheelbase easily

Either way... There's options out there.. didn't mean to step on toes @Cobber.

no toes squashed bro, I just can't "think" of a deck with truck mounts closer to the nose and tail...
please prove me wrong dude? ;)

and as I said 9.25 is too narrow for my cave man feet so I am biased

You probably already saw this, just thought I would toss it in.

I'm very happy with my [Landyacht Mummyboard](http://landyachtz.com/mummy-jungle-fern) . Turns on a dime, no wheel bite, nice grip. 15lbs all in, 10s2p battery, single motor.

The Powell-Peralta Lance Mountain Resissue is short (30.5") but has a huge tail and a long wheelbase and is rather stable at high-speed

Nice! I just received my Powell Peralta Mike McGil reissue! I'm pairing that with the 10s5p from DIYEboard, which should arrive soon. I'll share the build when I have more of it together. So glad you mentioned the Lance Mountain option, it encouraged me to look into an old/new PP board like I use to ride as a kid back in the 80s. BTW, the McGil has one of the longest wheelbases in the PP reissue line at 16.625". The longest is the Jay Smith at 17.25" (https://www.skateone.com/powell-peralta-jay-smith-model-reissue-white-skateboard-deck-10-x-30-25)

If u have some money and want a high quality build that‚Äôs a bit shorter I‚Äôd take a look at this boi (https://www.sickboards.nl/en/longboards/10417-bossa-platform-28-rio-deck-only.html#/232-flex-light) I‚Äôve been neglecting to ebordify it because I like kickpushing it so much XD.

That [Powell-Peralta Bones Brigade Mike McGill Skull and Snake](https://www.amazon.com/Powell-Peralta-Brigade-Mike-McGill-Skateboard/dp/B07BGDGBCV) is the best or one of the best decks in the world for esk8, in my opinion.  The [Powell-Peralta Bones Brigade Lance Mountain Future Primitive](https://www.amazon.com/Brigade-Skateboard-Mountain-Primitive-Peralta/dp/B07BGGFKWF) is pretty close or equal...

The super-wide front, put some traditional kingpin trucks on there and those are stable even up to high speeds -- and they're shortboards with big tails that are super-easy to carry.  What else could you ask for?  I have those and tailless longboards and those are better by far.

@sk8l8r swears by the [Lush Machine](https://lushlongboards.com/buy/machine-3d/) deck which I have yet to try but it looks dope..

The front of that Bossa is dope af, maybe even more than the Mike McGill Skull and Snake, but the lack of a huge tail is a missed opportunity and a deal-breaker.  (Yes, I see the short tail that probably doesn't even really work to pick up a 20+ lb board.)

Awesome. Yeah, it is super wide, and has a nice concave. It's deep which might challenge attaching the enclosure, but others have used extra foam, which I'll try as well.  I just installed my Tail Bone tonight and it looks so cool! I ordered an authentic old school nose guard also, and went crazy with a new helmet and some light elbow and knee pads. I can't wait!

Yeah I‚Äôll have to agree with you there. Although we should note it‚Äôs original intention, which is not to be a short board deck at all, so that may be why has missed the ball there (it‚Äôs playing a whole different game). My favorite part would definitely be the flex. That is something ill-found in the shortboard market. All in all maybe not what your looking for but interesting nonetheless
