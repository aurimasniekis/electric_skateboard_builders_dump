I recently had a terrible customer service experience with Enertion and a great one with Maytech. 

On the Enertion front, I won't make any assertions as to who was wrong or right (because that doesn't exist, there is only good and bad, and that's a matter of perception), but in comparison to the customer service I have been exposed to in my work in the field of engineering and additionally in most other spheres of life (maybe good customer service is just a South African thing?), I've been left very disappointed.

A couple of weeks back (8th May), I pre-ordered 3 VESCs from Enertion - fully paid up front, when there was still much uncertainty as to if and when they would actually materialize. They were fully transparent about that, saying that they actually had no idea when they would be to ship orders out, and I took my risks there and accepted it for what it was. I was going to order 4, but my partner had cash flow difficulties and at that stage couldn't pay for the 4th. With knowledge of an impending price boom, we decided to cut our losses and order 3 for the bulk pricing and add a 4th when the funds were available, hopefully before the price increase and to maintain the price break. Bearing this in mind, I tried to ask for an estimate as to when the order would be available for shipping so that we could plan accordingly to ship the 4 together, and I was met with "it depends on when you ordered" (which kind of says absolutely nothing).

Funds became available and I immediately asked if I could add another to my order (this was quite some time before the first price increase). After much back and forth, the long and the short of it is that they said they couldn't add items to orders because of their "system". I urged them to make another plan ie just let me pay for another one via PayPal or whatever and just ship the 4 together. They got back to me after they increased the price to US$125 (they are pretty slow at replying and I think I've only got one reply within 24hrs, as they strive to do) saying they weren't willing to make another plan to maintain the bulk pricing. I then asked if I could order another at the old price and they said no, and when I complained about the service I was met with a very angry passive aggressive message from Jason (perhaps fueled by that single malt he seems to love talking about in his videos?) accusing me of threatening his staff and etc, when I did nothing of the sort, other than saying I was going to talk about this. 

The price is now US$130, almost 50% more than when I made the request to order another. My friend could afford another VESC, all things being equal in a perfect world, but because of Enertions's lack of will to try and make a plan, now he can't. That's his problem, I guess.

So who's right and who's wrong in this? No one is. It's just bad service. Not making any effort to trying to process a very simple request of adding another item to your order (or allowing you to create another completely separate order, whatever) at the same cost (at the time of the request), however complicated you find your system, is just bad service. Or at least it's not very good. I don't care about how your system works. You advertise a bulk price and I want to pre-order 3 and then I want to pre-order another long before the items are even available to be shipped and now it's a huge problem? The supplier should make a plan. I didn't even mind being pushed to the back of the queue. 

My friend now sits with 1 VESC, and he's looking elsewhere for the next one. Ollinboardco is looking like his option of choice, but Maytech may very well be an option, as it seems they will have the cheapest consistent offering when they become available (at around US$105).

I will add that I will not purchase anything again from Enertion, as a supplier who is not willing to make a simple plan for a customer does not deserve my business, and doesn't seem to want it either. They're not doing anyone any favours by selling stuff.

The contrasting experience came from amazing customer service from Maytech. Due to the same problem with not being able to afford a second VESC at the time, my friend also opted for only one motor, so we ordered 3 x 6355 230Kv motors. They shipped these out to my Aramex box in Shanghai a couple of days after we ordered (they were made to order, and super quickly I might add). 

When the cash became available to order the 4th motor, this coincided with us finding out that Aramex refused to ship our motors down to South Africa as they are unacceptable items (probably the magnets). We told Maytech about our problem and it turns out that they had heard about this from Aramex and had already made a plan to collect the motors for us! Agnes at Maytech emailed us with her ID and asked us to authorise her to collect our motors. We emailed her asking to add the 4th motor and to quote for shipping, and then we put the order through. No problem. 

Agnes emailed me a day later saying she messed up the shipping quote, and said that we needed to pay the outstanding amount. 

I went through the quote and thought she had made a mistake (the weight on their website is for the motor only, not the additional accessories). She replied that she hadn't, but that Maytech would absorb the extra shipping cost. Absolutely amazing. And from a Chinese supplier even? My mind has been blown. Not only did they have no problem adding an item to my order, they without prompt made arrangements to fix our shipping problem (which was my fault), and gave us a discount on shipping.

So, yeah. I think the conclusion to this is that Enertion doesn't seem to want your business all that much. At least not enough to do the very least to help a customer out. I guess they could try to refute that here? Perhaps they're growing too quickly? I just hope they don't forget their roots and lose their business. Although I often find myself thankful for the some of the resources they've provided over the years (which bear in mind are all completely in the interests of their business), they've lost my business. 

Maytech on the other hand really does seem to want your business, and are willing to go more than out of their way to help you, as far as my experience goes. I'll be buying from them a lot more in future. 

Enertion, not so much.

I'm not entirely surprised. On the surface Enertion seems like a very humble and community centric company, and I still believe that they are, or at least try to be. The problem is they are severely understaffed and under prepared for the growth they've been experiencing over the last couple months. I've had similar gripes about their customer service lately as well.

My most recent experience with them was that I ordered a raptor 4/20 but decided a couple weeks later that I wanted to make a DIY build since that's what Jason and the esk8 community encourage. I decided to cancel my Raptor and instead get 2 VESCs instead and wanted to know if I could use my spot in line from the original Raptor order for the VESCs I would've gotten from it. I talked to Enertion support about this (which took a long time due to their slow response times) and they said it would be doable. I put in a new order for 2 VESCs and about a week goes by with no confirmation of the refund for the Raptor or if my place in line was preserved. I emailed Enertion again and they said it would not be possible to keep my place in line for the VESCs. So now instead of expecting it within the next week, I'm now waiting until mid July to get the VESCs, though realistically, probably later. To make matters worse, when Enertion refunded me I lost $120 due to currency fluxuation, though I can hardly fault Enertion for that.

I gave up and ordered 2 VESCs from Ollinboards but I still have a Space Cell Pro 4 on order from Enertion, who knows when I'll ever see that...

The price is now $180, almost double what it should have been for a bulk order of 4.
[/quote]

I don't understand what you are saying. Was it really ever down to 90AUD in a bulk order or do you just mix up AUD and USD?
Also their behavior is totally understandable - this is a small company that operates out of a garage versus a probably pretty big chinese corporation. Just don't have the same kind of expectations as when you order from amazon and you will be fine. I for one just calmly wait for my VESCs - they will come when they are ready.

Yes, whew. My mistake. The AUD/USD setting on their website confuses things. Humble apologies.

I guess that makes it a bit better. Maybe my friend will be able to buy another from them now. I'm not having anything to do with it though.

I don't know how big of a 'corporation' Maytech is. That's a big assumption you're making there. If they don't have stock of motors to ship out and have to make to order, I doubt they're that big. They're a hobby company, as is Enertion. I think it's quite a fair comparison.

Regardless though. I'm not expecting anything. I just said that I had a bad experience with Enertion and felt that people should know about it.

I'm waiting pretty calmly for my 2 VESCs too and my friend for his 1 VESC, despite Jason threatening cancelling my order in his last message. Would just be nice if there were 4 coming. Wouldn't actually mind if he cancelled my order now either, as the exchange rate has taken a bit of a turn.

According to [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/company/maytech-electronics-co.-ltd) they have between 200 to 500 employees - tell me again how that is a fair comparison to a garage company?

According to [this](http://maytechchina.en.ec21.com/company_info.html) they have 300 employees, estimated revenue between 2 to 5Mio USD and a factory with 7800m^2.

Interesting. As I said I don't know. Excuse me for making the assumption that you were making an assumption :blush:. 

Fair point though, although it's besides the point as far as I'm concerned. Bad service is bad service. I would actually have expected worse customer service from a 'corporation'. Which is usually the case. Especially from Chinese ones, apparently, which everyone seems to love hating on.

I think you're right though, they're growing too fast and don't seem to be able to deal with it while keeping their shit together in some regards.

I should keep my mouth shut so I don't get banned from this forum, so I'll keep this short, but Agnes from Maytech has been great with me. A bit of a language barrier at times, but I'm ordering steez remotes from them for about half the price of enertion.  I'll be curious as to their quality, but for something like a controller, I don't imagine problems as there's no unforeseen possible stresses on the components like the vesc. I'll be curious to see how their vescs are, but I don't think they will use the same quality of components as chaka, and thus will stick with chaka unless they can be proven to be just as reliable.

Agreed. I think @chaka is the way to go for VESCs at the moment. I'm going to try Maytech's when they're available though. I have a pilot project in the works and I can't afford to pay artisanal prices for VESCs. I'm pretty sure Maytech will get their VESCs up to scratch pretty soon though. They have actual engineers working on that sheat. I don't know if the same can be said for the other manufacturers at the moment? I'd be more inclined to trust an engineered product at face value. We all know how Enertion and DIYElectricSkateboards have struggled to get it right this far.

I'm more interested in the quality of components.

The problems I've had with both of my enertion VESCs (1 which came broken, the other broke in day 2 and of course no help or replacement, and chakas in the same setup have been great in 2 months since then) I believe are related to poor quality of components. Chaka spends a lot on components, and has stated that his old price (around $110 usd I believe) was basically the cost of components. He has said him self that he's over engineered the components to be able to take more abuse then they should ever take. This is what needs to be done with the vesc, as these are going into 1000's of different configurations, many of which are likely poorly engineered, which will lead to more stress on the vesc then it was originally expected to take. If you leave little room for errors, they will break frequently. Chaka rarely has people break his vescs, and one of the main differences I've seen is his choice to use components that can take more abuse then the vesc was originally specked for.

Completely agree. This is an engineering thing though. Components are components. They have data sheets specifying their performance and if they don't perform according to those specs, the manufacturers can be held to account. With an open source project like the VESC, it's up to manufacturers to spec components and manufacturing processes that will work, and then test them and validate the product before they sell them. I think that @chaka has done a great job of this considering his means. I think the other manufacturers (Enertion and DIY) have suffered here for the lack of engineering knowledge into how things actually work. Yes, the VESC design works very well on paper and if you hand solder them using good components and adequate skill, but in the real world of product design and manufacture this is a completely different task, and is best left up to the big boys (as Enertion seems to have found out). With Maytech's extensive product offering, most of which they seem to make themselves, and engineers on board, I think I'll trust their VESCs when they're ready to sell them.

As a side note, in engineering there is something called a safety factor. When designing something, you look at your worst case loading and you apply a safety factor to that and design based on the values that come out of that. The safety factor is based on the extremity and probability of the failure. It's a basic risk analysis. Ie, if you're designing a bridge that can hold 10000 people, and your probability of failure of a material used is 5%, you have a low probability of failure but a huge extremity, say 1000%. Your safety factor is then 1000/100 * 95/100 = 9.5. So you design the bridge to be 9.5 times stronger than it actually needs to be to account for the risk.

The safety factor on enertions VESCs so far seem to be 1 IMO. Time and time again I have seen posts on this forum where enertions have failed for no real reason, then chakas in the same situation work flawlessly. Then what Jason told me when they broke was that it's my fault for running them in a configuration that hadn't been tested before (which wasn't really true, since several others where already using carvons with the vescs and space cell before me).

Rule number 1 of customer service: the customer is always right, even when they are wrong.

I fought with Jason forever about my 9mm belts breaking on a single motor drive system, and he always insisted he never had an issue. He said it was too high acceleration, too high deceleration, everything in the book, except that 9mm belts on mono drive systems are just too small. If you haven't noticed, he uses 12mm belts now on mono drive kits. It took 8 months before he finally agreed a month ago to send me a 12mm belt kit for free. He did keep his word to it, so bravo to Jason for that. But why is it that you always seem to have to fight to get customer service (if you do get it), when that's what he's selling his products on. Heck, I emailed enertion about my receiver breaking for the steez remote, and it took 6 days to get back to me. I already had plans with maytech to buy them before they could even get back to me with an answer, lol. And that's the great customer service enertion prides itself on?

Yeah, exactly. I think the main problem I have with this whole experience is that they seem to waste no time telling everyone how great they are and how great their customer service is (and criticizing other business in the process, as per some of Enertion/Jason's video's and posts), but in reality when all of the stories come out it's an actual load of BS.

When you have to ask/beg someone to make a really simple plan for your based on a sales performance that they are providing that isn't adequate, you're really at a loss. They are making money from your business at the end of the day. And if they aren't giving you good business, on your side, what's the point in pandering?

I'll see how these new Enertion VESCs perform (if and when I receive them, my order might be cancelled due to this topic, will have to see). Hopefully their supplier has used a safety factor of more than 1. :laughing:. Maybe I'll experience a turnaround and order from them again, but it isn't looking likely.

Hey guys, as a member of this forum with no branding and providing a service.

I offer BLDC tool for Windows and OS X to make it easy for end users to program and use your vesc.
(Chaka doesn't support this and suggested to use Linux.)

But I am answering over 20 customer emails a day providing assistance for installation and how to program vesc and no finacual benifits to my self or maybe a $20 donation here or there, but the service time out weighs the time I spend on the product.

What you have to understand is that Jason has a lot of paid products he is selling so his time spent on service is huge I would say over 100 emails a day and up until last couple of week it was just him and a young guy who helped him in the USA answer emails.
Plus packing orders, assembling raptors, doing stock control making sure vesc are being made, making videos and editing and replying to emails.
Plus he is a stay at home dad and only works 3 days a week.

Then for most of you there is a 12 hour time difference.

I'm not taking sides but most of you already know this as you watch his videos and have read posts when he has said all of this. So don't make the order or wait for things to improve, guess what I'm trying to make an app and I don't have any working vesc ATM coz I'm also waiting and I don't have the time to solder some up my self.

He has alot of vesc waiting shipment and the fight on price isn't worth the time.

I brought an iMac a while ago and it went up in price 40c to the $1 in 1 week because of exchange rates well I was pissed and wish a made that order a week earlier but I wasn't emailing Tim Cook giving him shit about it.

I was the first person to organise a bulk vesc order just over 1 year ago. I ordered 50 vesc and Jason Brough 25 of them off of me and resold them.
The factory screwed us and used wrong componants and we got blasted for this on endless sphere.
Jason has never made that mistake since and every vesc order since componants have come from mouser according to the BOM so it's not about components. he could have had vesc out early but he refused to use different mosfets with a little higher resistance because of the back lash he got with the very first order.
He has used a few factories since and he doesn't have the skill or equipment to be soldering 100vesc or 500vesc in a month so he uses a factory and that has been a learning curve but he is trying to improve.

Moral of the story, buy from enertion or don't buy from enertion.

Here are some simple facts that might make it easier to understand how we operate.

- Big Commerce (our e-commerce platform doesn't allow orders to be modified easily) 
- All website sales need to be recorded into our accounting system, it is linked to our big commerce platform, it doesn't automatically update.
- We don't send out PayPal money requests, because this transaction isn't accounted for in our accounting systems, It would need to be manually entered and update across three different platforms and still wouldn't meet our accounting requirements.


below is  a summary of our communications with you.

**1. You asked us for a delivery date of the vesc, we didn't give you that information because we didn't know the answer. I suppose we could have lied to you and made up an answer. However honesty is our policy so we told you the truth, we don't know.**

Your response:

_"Hmmm. So what you're saying is that you have absolutely no idea of the regularity of your stock arriving"_

**Yes, that is why we said we don't know**


----------


----------



**2. You asked to modify your order to add items, we said its not possible and that you need to order the item separately or alternatively we could cancel the first order & you could place another order with the correct quantity.**

Your response:

_Unfortunately I'm simply not going to accept this level of customer service._

_Both your's and the owner's slow response time to my messages, combined with your inability and lack or will to make a very simple plan to help as customer are now going to cost me a lot more money._

_My request was very very simple. Nothing outlandish. I ordered 3 VESCs (preordered even!!!), paid upfront, with absolutely no accurate idea of when they are to arrive. A couple of days later I said I'd like to add one another to my bulk order. What excuse could you possibly have not to be able to do this?! You use PayPal. I use PayPal. You didn't even have the VESCs yet at that stage. Now you want me to pay 40% more?_

_This is incredibly poor customer service and for an organisation that's so marketing conscious about having good customer service and for acting like you're doing everyone a favour. This is pretty disappointing._

_This isn't a threat or anything. But if we can't sort this out rightfully, people are definitely going to hear about it. Because no body should have to stand bullshit customer service._

**We gave you very clear options, you ignored them and instead started threatening & swearing at my staff.** 




**The problem here is:**
**1. You ordered incorrectly.**
**2. You ignored our instructions.**

Here's an interesting bit from another thread posted earlier:

[quote="onloop, post:330, topic:2219"]
I have 2000 vesc being made, the first batch was overdue 2 months, mostly due to my extremely strict guidelines. The last batch got rejected as LED was on backward. The VESC worked but LED didn't. Once they are sorted out (7 days from now) i will have the world's largest supply of VESC, **Maytech is considering buying from me as they can't get theirs working. Be warned.** I wiell also have the best warranty.

Hey "mate". Thanks for elaborating. 

I'm not going to nit pick your post and choice selection of quotes of our correspondence, although I will just say that they're a pretty disingenuous selection and far from an accurate summary, so for anyone interested in a more comprehensive summary, read the first post.

As for your accusations of threatening and swearing at your staff, yes, I said "bullshit". Big whoop. My intention was not aggression to your staff, I was merely describing your organization's level of customer service. As to my theoretical "threats", that's a matter of perception, but I can see how this is a convenient place to go to for you because it means you can point fingers and not have to take responsibility for your poor service.

Anyway, we've had our argument and there is no point in rehashing it on here. Bad service is bad service. Simple as that. I've moved on and I just thought people should know about the lengths you're not willing to go to to help your customers.

**The actual problems here are:**
**1. You were not willing to make a very simple plan to help your customer.**
**2. When I offered to comply with your instruction for putting through a second order, you wouldn't allow me to pay the same price as the first 3 items.**
**3. Your accounting system is inefficient.**
**4. Your customer service leaves much to be desired. It's slow and unhelpful.**

Out of interest, I wonder how much money we both spent on emails back and forth, when this could very easily have been sorted out after my first request? Probably the cost of a VESC. Food for thought.

Peace out and good luck with your future ventures.

Hey mate, I'm not passing judgement on the issue here, I suspect it is a little column A, a little column be when it comes to the fault for the issue blowing up here. But I do want to argue something that seems to pop up frequently- and that is the notion that 'the customer is always right".

This is a notion which makes us feel empowered as consumers, but it is, to a large degree, a fallacy. Why? Because if this was the case, then this would imply business existed solely for the purpose of satisfying the customer, and it isn't. It also exists to pay wages, grow, and make profit. So really, it exists for the both the customer, and also it's own reasons.  

The more accurate saying for business is "There are some customers you don't want to do business with". This is when it isn't financially viable for a business to do business with a certain client, and some clients cost more to deal with than it is worth in return. Business is fundamentally an exchange of value between two parties; the business exchanges goods and the customer exchanges cash, and a relationship builds based on **joint value** creation.  

The adage the 'customer is always right' suggests that the only value that needs to be created is for the customer. Which is wrong. 

What you might be seeing here is a case where @onloop is making a choice about value creation- it is simply makes more sense for him to service the next set of customers than to invest the same finite time trying to satisfy @makepeace et al 100%, especially when @onloop was not in control of the decisions the customer chose to make all by himself.

You can argue the merits of that in terms of reputation, building customer loyalty via reciprocity etc, but ultimately he runs a business and is making his choices based on what he believes is best for him and his business (and he is probably prioritising short term gains over long term effects because he has no choice as a home business with bugger all capital). 

In terms of deciding which customers are worth doing business with and investing the extra mile in, I suspect most the growing businesses engaged on this forum find that the DIY scene is actually pretty fickle. Many (of course not all) openly shop on price alone, despite the pitfalls in doing that, and show almost zero brand loyalty by openly supporting cheaper clones or direct-from-factory suppliers, and trying to pressure price reductions out of small business with group buys and bulk orders with non-DIY scene suppliers. I find that ironic, especially when there is such a strong expectation of superior customer-support, but almost no brand loyalty in return. The title and intention behind this thread is a classic example of that. 

I think @onloop could improve his messaging and demeanour with customers, but I also feel almost every issue is out of his control. If he wasn't growing 1000 odd % in 3 months you could be assured he would be working 24/7 to solve dicky little problems like the one in this thread, because he would have no choice. But he does have choice (like @makepeace does) and it seems he is prioritising effort where it makes the most sense right now.  

And if anyone thinks superior customer service comes for free- it doesn't. You pay for it because it costs time and man hours and those costs get passed back in price rises. The blokes going after the DIY market share are always looking to reduce costs because DIY's are largely driven by a desire to build boards at home as **cheaply** as possible. Cheaper prices is offset with an expectation you can order yourself without screwing up, you can determine what you want/ need yourself, and can build/ self-help yourself. It all goes to custard when you want all of that flexibility and support, plus superior quality products **and** the cheapest prices- it's a mutually exclusive situation and something will give.

Completely agree with you here. It's entirely his decision as to whether or not customers are worth his business, as it is mine vice versa. He must just understand and own that if he chooses not to provide a very basic level of service that people are going to talk about it. 

I stand nothing to lose as I can just go somewhere else. His business is not a unicorn. And I certainly don't want to do business with someone who doesn't want to do business with me.

Dear Mr Makepeace, I have provided a refund for your order of the 3x VESC priced at the sale price of $99ea  = Approx $300USD?

Now you can go buy the VESC for a much higher price wherever you like.... 

You could nearly buy two from Chaka with that refund, However shipping to South Africa will be a killer.... Or Maybe some from Maytech, they will charge shipping too, good luck.

@onloop yes, I noticed. Thanks for cancelling my order and refunding without consulting me about it. Really mature and professional way to deal with this situation. Your customer complains about your customer service and you cancel their order.

Once again, you've outdone yourself on the customer service front.

I'm just glad I never have to deal with your organisation again and I'll be glad to give my business to someone who actually wants it.

Best of luck to you Mr Potter.

This is a true test of your consumer morals....  You get the chance to decide who to buy from:

1. Go with the lowest price best deal?.... (from the supplier you claim that has bad service)
2. Stick to your guns and pay more? 
3. Or risk buying a dodgy Chinese VESC & still paying more?

Not really. I'm always willing to give someone a chance. As it stands I believe the customer experience I've had with you has been bad. You have the opportunity to change that impression. You seem to be willing to try to fix that now, so I'll give that a chance.

Also, I didn't complain, I merely asked if we could make another plan and made a suggestion as refunding the whole amount and doing a whole new transaction is more expensive and time consuming. In the process, you upped the price and were then unwilling to make a plan from there on.

You are willing to choose price over perceived service levels, That thought process is in line with most consumer case studies...

If i retract my offer of matching the original sales price you will shop elsewhere until you find the next lowest price. So in fact, you are proof that service doesn't actually matter. You & others like you are therefore the cause of the bad service.

You are an oxymoron, Complain that service isn't good enough but never actually willing to pay for it. So in fact, i gave you everything you wanted in the first place you just are not aware of it.

I hope readers of this thread can now better understand the challenges faced by small business....

You're being a bit childish and unprofessional now. Your VESC platinum includes product support, which is an additional paid for service, not customer service. That is not what this thread is about. This thread is about customer service and how a business interacts with it's customers.

If my VESC breaks, that's my problem and I factor that into my risk of buying the product. I don't want product support.

As above, you determine the way forward here. I'll await your response to my PM.

It was meant for Jason, he was wasting time debating with makepeace (funny name, since he is doing the opposite). 

People became a little spoiled when they were able to buy the vesc at such a low price, that price was very close to cost. The vesc is a horrible thing to mass produce thus costly when done by a professional partner, MANY things need to be manually assembled.

You've missed the point of this conversation.

The supplier (Enertion) was unwilling to make a very reasonable and simple plan to accommodate a customer. 

That customer is fairly commenting on their bad customer experience and sharing this with the greater public, contrasting it with a conversely great customer experience with another supplier (Maytech).

Nothing wrong with that.

Please consider that you might be a little to demanding/spoiled. Changing orders from the past isn't something to take for granted, its means quite a bit of work. 

I don't care in what context it was, there is no way arguments/statements like this can be constructive:
"This isn't a threat or anything. But if we can't sort this out rightfully, people are definitely going to hear about it. Because no body should have to stand bullshit customer service." (I will take this back if this quote was tampered with).

Not sure whether this needed to be posted here in such detail. IMO.

If you made a change to an original order then one needs to consider the consequences. Its then up to the business as to whether they can handle the change that you want them to manuipulate to for your convienance and change of mind.

I'm not taking either side as I know Enertion would admit they need to pull their head in to deliver and to keep customers happy. Which they are trying to rectify, but seem overwelmed.  

Its a viscous cricle for any one in this parts eboading as demand is out stripping supply. Eveyone knows the background of what Onloop is doing. Hes doing the best he can, and for now most will just have to put up with it. Or just go elesehere which eveyone has the right to do.

Lets move on. Be patient and just deal with it all of you.

I don't think you understand what you're asking for. Think about it for a second, if there is 100 VESCs and you're customer #100 and i'm customer #1, and all of a sudden I decided to add an additional of 2 VESCs onto my order making the same demand as you do to "stay in line", and @onloop do as I say,  what do you think will happen to your order? It wouldn't exactly be fair. 

Admittedly, Enertion does have some customer communication issues, but you can take that up on another thread. In this instance in regards to editing your order, in cutting in line and in keeping the same price, you're asking for a lot, you don't think you are but thats your subjective feelings.

Also, you publicize this interaction with both companies in a way in which I consider incredibly disingenuous. You decided to take it upon yourself to RUIN someone's day by publicly denouncing his company's policy even though he's already told you its company policy. If you don't like it then take your business elsewhere. Support his competitor if you think his service is subpar, there was no need for this thread making a mockery with this shit show. 

What was the point of this? To inform customers to stay away from Enertion because of their lack of communication and/or bad customer service? Is your ego satisfied now that you follow up with your threat of "...people are definitely going to hear about it"? Can you blame the man for trying to defend his company and confront you in a thread that makes his company look bad? Seriously, you're not making yourself look good at all in this situation.

Thanks for your opinion.

I explicitly said in one of my communications with them that I don't mind going to the back of the queue or whatever delay might be incurred. I don't care about that. I want to be able to pre-order an extra VESC at the same price as the other three that I pre-ordered. However they need to do that on their side is not my problem. It's a very simple request.

Yeah, I agree. Whether I'm asking for a lot is a matter of perception. Yes, maybe I expect too much. Depends on what I'm usually exposed to and that's different for everyone.

The point of this thread is to expose what I believe to be bad customer service and to give the supplier a chance to rectify the situation or defend themselves. If I don't believe that I am being treated well as a consumer by a supplier, I want other people to know that, so that they can have a better experience elsewhere. I don't want other people to have negative dealings with suppliers. That's constructive.

Its not as simple as it sound. You don't go to Apple and ask them to adjust their price given the same situation do you? It doesn't matter if its a big corporation or a small garage company, if thats the way their policy works, theres no point in debating or making a big deal out of it. If Maytech is willing to go the mile to help out a consumer then kudos to them, but don't expect the same across the board.

Your feelings are hurt, I empathize, but the way your thread is worded makes Enertion out to be the bad guy here and that's not constructive at all.

i do think everyone is entitled to show of a case of bad customer service as he feels he has been treated wrong.

but for me the real issue in this thread is actually the tone of Jasons answer toward his costumer.

you do not have to say to your costumer you are right but i do think it is really quite impolite to tell your custumer that he is just cheap.

even if this is Jasons opinion, i do not think it is necesarry to tell everyone we dislike what we do think about them, how many assholes do you meat in one day and you are not telling every single one of them what you really think about them because there is no point.

Exactly my point. However there is some engineering to be done in production to assure quality etcetera. That might be differing, but I highly doubt a US company gets away with manufacturing sub-par boards with crap components (they of course manufacture things for others as well).

Edit: And in all honesty, if three were ordered I would say it's not ok to add (systems fault or not) more in that order since there is a queue on the VESCS and have been for a long time. There are more people that are in line after you and have also paid the price up front.

To be honest there is nothing wrong about increasing price of a product as a seller. Its not bad customer service. If it needs to be done, it needs to be done. And if I see VESC production cost for personal and bulk for conpanies, its reasonable to be priced at 150usd. VESC is not a cheap product. Nevertheless DIY route is filled with uncertainty, you took the risk. If all of sudden finance is the issue, is not the problem
of the seller. Cant blame them for it.

Im going to add my two cents I had a similar case to the one this guy experienced and a completely different reaction

I placed an order for to vescs on april for my build im doing a dual drive board but then later about two weeks later i decided to build an additional board for my wife so i needed a third vesc i emailed enertion and asked if i could add a third vesc to my order to get the discounted preorder price the replied to me telling me that they couldnt add a third vesc but i could a cancel my order and do three vescs in one order or just order a third. Guess what I did? I placed an order for a third vesc. I didnt throw a fit at @onloop or whoever replied to me. They game me options and i did what they offered and said was possible. People there is such thing as customer service as in what is reasonable and possible for a business to do and there is "I want it my way and only my way because its what i want and i should get what i want"  

Guys understand that as far as being open with information enertion or jason have done a good job, you have to understand when they say they dont know when they will have stuff it literally means that they dont know how long manufacture will take how long samples will take if there will be problems or delay on that side or even shipping delays. 

I give enertion props for being open with the information they have given and hope that all the issues they have had straiten out and to other customers dont blame the company for something that you couldnt get how you wanted be an adult and take the options you are given

There is a degree of engineering that still needs to be done. There is some play in certain components of the vesc, and you can spec them higher (which chaka does), so they can take more abuse then otherwise expected. Chaka's heat sinks have also drastically brought heat down, something no other producer is doing. I would say those are engineering decisions which have worked out well for chaka, and his customers. So there is still some degree of engineering.

[quote="Nate, post:64, topic:4191"]

[/quote]

The hing with apple is, you can get customer service with a click. They are quick to get back to you, where as enertion takes days, in my last case, almost a week. That's why this situation came to fruition, and comparing this to something a apple is a bit disingenuous.


Everyone here is forgetting what creating this situation, which was a lack of communication. This is something that gets harder for small businesses, and it used to be better. They have grown, and it's hard to scale up, but the second part of this is the attitude. Even if your customer makes unreasonable requests, or is a dick to you (not saying this is the case here. but), there's no reason to talk to a customer the way Jason is.

Why is it you don't see any of enertions competitors getting drawn into battles like this on here or people complaining about their customer service, yet they are on this forum, and deal with customers on here. I have seen 1 negative thread about diy ever, never anything negative about chaka or carvon. But there's been so many involving enertion.

The attitude of Jason in this thread is unprofessional IMO. Even if your customer is treating you like you are a piece of shit, you try your best to be polite and helpful. Instead, there's childish mind games being played. It's something no one else in the industry is doing.

Here's a parallel story of good customer service: My carvons started bending where the motor and truck meet, I emailed Jerry at carvon, he emailed me back less than 20 minutes later. We talked and decided I would keep riding for a week to see if they get worse. They did, and I again contacted him. With in a few hours, he emailed me back with the offer to send them back and fix them free of charge. 2 weeks later, they are back with new wheels and truck fixed. Always polite and helpful, never condescending or trying to play mind games. It really is that simple. Separate personal emotions and business, and don't let your personal emotions creep into your business.

[/quote]

This is an interesting point. You do as a business have to consider the damages that can be done by turning away swaths of customers. I say that having seen stories similar to this a quite more often then with other distributors on this forum. You don't want negative stories about your company out there if you have the ability to fix a problem that would lead to said negative story. Would it have taken that much work or effort to simply say, "Hey, sorry it took so long to get back to you. we are quite busy these days. Buy another vesc and put this 1 time code in. It might take longer than the other 3, but we will get it to you asap. Thank you for your order." Problem solved while treating your customer with respect, regardless of weather they treated you with respect or not.

[quote="magnetvox, post:34, topic:4191"]
The adage the 'customer is always right' suggests that the only value that needs to be created is for the customer. Which is wrong.
[/quote]

I can see that interpretation of it, but I do think that phrase is one which is open to interpretation. Obviously, a business needs to whats best for the business, but the customer is always right phrase comes from this idea that a company is what it's make of it. With out customers, a company can't grow. I remember Jason saying way back that many of his customers are returning customers, I used to be one of those returning customers. People don't return if they don't feel satisfied, so you need satisfied customers in order to get the returning customer that gave enertion the chance to exist and grow.

You can have a terrible product, and great customer service (which no offense intended, I think boosted boards is), or great products and terrible customer service (which I where I think enertion is). You can have a terrible product, but if they can sell the shit out of it, your going to do great. You can have a great product, but without the customer service, your selling products based on the product alone, which many don't like. In either case, the company can't exist with out its customers.

The point is, that saying in my interpretation is that a company should build itself by leaving its customers happy and satisfied. Some will suck up more resources then they seem worth, but I don't think that was the case here at all. It wasn't a hard request, there was a simple solution (as I stated above), and the response was childish.

It's hard because yes, there is a line. For example, a homeless guy comes into your store, and creates a ruckus (a common scene here in sf). Do you try to service him or kick him out? It's a calculated decision, and a tough one. You may lose more customers than gain by servicing him. This is why I believe they almost always get kicked out.

I respect your arguments @magnetvox and thank you for bringing up good points, I can see why you feel how you do, and I don't think there is a right and a wrong way to interpret that phrase. You have opened my mind to a another view point, and thank you for that :)

When the AUD to USD currency conversion dropped 5 cents last month I called the bank and asked for the better price they gave me a few weeks before. They said no.... i said its easy... just add some extra cash to the transfer i did a few weeks ago...so simple!.... they refused..... so i threatened them. I told them that their service was shit. I spammed their email box whinging to them to please do right by me...  I have literally spent over 100k with them.... but they still refused, they said their systems can't do it...

Its so unfair, they should improve their systems so that I get what I want. I am the customer and I am always right.

The guy at the monopoly money store said he'll give me a much better exchange rate... he was willing to do anything I asked. I'll never use the bank again!

Ouch. Its now starting to go round in circles here. iMO. State you defence if need be to protect your company, but just take out the unnecessary extra analogies. @makepeace and yourself will just have to disagree on each others side. Thats the reality.  The posts give a reasonable idea of the issue. Now back ro work:)😀😉

Ahhh, the growing pains of small businesses. 
Been there, done that. It's a rough road at first, but worthwhile if you can stick it out.

The fact is, he did offer (twice) to rectify the problem (which you created with indecision).

Then, he supplied a very valid point in that the shear chance that you would reorder wouldn't have been related to his customer service at all. Merely the price of the item. 

Now what I got from your reaction was he was absolutely correct. You would have been all in had he not publicly called you out on it. Even though, you just finished doing the same thing to him.

inline with this topic is the fact that everyone wants top quality until they have the opportunity to buy it cheaper, from an unknown source, that hasn't even made any yet. 
To take it further, they will quote quality and then buy the cheapest shit they can find to put them together. Mo better?

First off I'm going to sidestep any of the conflict stuff and get back on the thread. Maybe lighten things up a bit....:sunglasses:

My experience with Maytech was pretty good. Good email conversations and stuff. Got a little personal at times. I think I  almost got to second base with Eileen@Maytech at one point. heh heh heh. :smiling_imp:


I have not had experience ordering from Enertion, but I think it is more than clear that Jason is passionate about ESK8 and that is what I like about him! He's passionate as hell about this stuff! I really believe that he wants to do right by his customers. He's gotten beat up a bunch on this forum, but he's a solid dude at the core.

[/quote]

Believe it or not, it was an actual picture that was sent with the emails! Sort of like a signature...
I should probably take the picture down. LOL
But this is seriously a Maytech Rep and they are quite professional to deal with.

Actually, not.

The problem was created by the inefficiencies of Enertion's system and them not being able to make a plan around that. 

Sure, I made one wrong step in believing that there was a simpler way to settle the matter without cancelling the whole order, refunding and making another order of 4. But by the time I was informed that this was definitely not possible, the price had gone up and Enertion refused to reconcile this fact.

Jason has made one strangely psychologically veiled attempt to rectify the problem (and any actual action following from his offer of "goodwill" has so far not been forthcoming). I tried to move the conversation about that to PM but received no response and instead got some arrogant accusations of how I'm an oxymoron etc.

I don't want to get into this stupid argument about the consumer going for the lowest price regardless of the customer service, because I think there has been some conflation and projection involved and I don't think it's an accurate summary of my position at all and I think that this is just a way of removing the attention from Enertion and pointing fingers and publicly defaming me so that they don't have to deal with the issue. 

At the end of the day, they're a business, and I'm a reasonably unhappy customer. Pointing out what may or may not be wrong with the customer doesn't change this fact and is conflating the issue at hand.

My position is this. I ordered 3 VESCs. I changed my mind and wanted an extra one, and informed the supplier of this well in advance of the price increase. They made an offer of a complex way to sort it out, I made a suggestion of a simpler way. They said it couldn't be done again, and by this time the price had gone up. I then was happy to comply with their offer and redo the order if the price was the same as before. That wasn't taken to. I then complained about it. That wasn't taken to. I then complained about it on the forum. That wasn't taken to, and my order was forcefully cancelled and I was refunded without being consulted about it. Following this, eventually an offer of "goodwill" was made, allowing me to get what I wanted in the first place. This is still in process.

Whether this is really an offer of goodwill or a strange way at making an irrelevant point and making both of us look like fools remains to be seen.

Sure, I want the VESCs at the price that I originally intended to pay for them, but that is not the main point. The main point is that the supplier acknowledges that there is a valid reason for my complaint (or not valid, whatever, but at least acknowledges my complaint) and is willing to make an offer/plan to fix this. I am not going to hold a grudge if a supplier wants the opportunity to change my impression. This is not about money. 

If the supplier had not made the offer I would have very easily gone to someone else and not shopped there any more until I was given a reason to otherwise (ie that they were willing to make amends on a relationship level). It's got nothing to do with who is the cheaper supplier in my view.

I am perfectly willing to make a mature, amicable plan to sort this out with Enertion, and on the face of it they seem to be too. So far the way that the gesture of "goodwill" is panning out isn't looking very promising though. Maturity, goodwill and childish, arrogant name-calling are not often mutually relevant concepts.

As a gesture of goodwill, If you do want to order again, be sure to select the correct qty, I will process a refund making the unit price equivalent to the sale price.

this thread could have ended with this post. 
even though he was a jerk about it in the next post, you could have stopped digging.
anyway I have seen enough this is over. now.
