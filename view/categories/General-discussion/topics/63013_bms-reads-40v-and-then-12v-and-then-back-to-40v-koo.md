Please help!!!!! I have a koowheel battery with bms .... the battery pack reads 40v before bms like it should... and after the bms it reads 40v sometimes and 12v sometimes... and when I was getting 40v reading I slid into board and the power light came on as well as all 4 battery level indicator lights!  So I thought I was good but when I programmed the controller... it did not spin the wheels... but the board and controller were showing they synced up so idk!?!?!? I know the problem is in the bms but don't know if I could repair the issue with the bms without buying a new bms or bypassing it and dealing with a balanced charger and the expense for that when I don't have the cash for disposal right now... so any help would be greatly appreciated!!! And please no cry baby replies from over sensitive people that are soft as melted butter!!! Ty

chill bro. Please try to format your post in a way that makes it easier to read. If i'm not mistaken, your issue is that the BMS is somehow alternating between reading at 12v and 40v? It sounds to me like your BMS might be dead, but i don't know enough aboubt them to make a conclusive diagnosis. Do you have another battery or a variable power supply that you could try to test with?

yeah man, what a scummy move. 

This is what I read the first time on this
"Please helo!!! I have a koowheel battery with bms … yes i know F koowheel… but the battery pack reads 40v before bms like it should and reads 40v sometimes and 12v sometimes and when I was getting 40v reading I slid into board and power light came on and all 4 battery level indicator less so I thought I was good but when I programmed the controller it did not spin the wheels but the board and controller were showing they synced up so idk! I know the problem is in the bms but don’t know if I could repair the issue with the bms without buying a new bms or bypassing it and dealing with a balanced charger and the expense for that when I don’t have the cash for disposal right now but… IF ANYONE HAS AN OLD KOOWHEEL/GENESIS/ BMS OR BATTERY OR BOARD LAYING AROUND THEY COULD SPARE I WOULD MORE THAN GLADLY TAKE IT AND USE IT ON MY CHANNEL AND GIVE CREDIT AND SHOUT OUTS IN A BUNCH OF MY VIDEOS AS WELL AS HOOEFULLY HELP ME TO MAKE MORE INSTRUCTIONAL VIDEOS FOR THE BOARDS THAT MAY HELP SEVERAL PEOPLE IN THE FUTURE WHEN THE COMPANY DOES NOTHING AT ALL THEY CAN AT LEAST REPAIR THEMSELFS IF NEEDED! SO ANY HELP OR OLD KOOWHEEL BATTERY OR BMS OR THE BOARDS THEMSELFS JUST LAYING COLLECTING DUST… WOULD FIND A GOOD HOME HERE AT BUFFALO ESKATE!"

Now I  am called "cry baby"

Chris Bro, Just buy BB if you can't figure out with that narrow mind.

well typically people who share information are called peers, which implies some type of (positive) relationship. When you come onto the forums and taunt us after spewing a word soup.... its not exactly a great way to introduce yourself.

Not only that, but you included NO pictures and NOTHING of substance. Do I need to show you your OG post?

Usually when there is a problem, and the reaction is the same, and there is only one common denominator (you)... chances are the problem isn't the people of the forum.

Trust me, you're not that special cupcake. This forum is full of people, newbies and intellectuals alike. They are working on things you could only dream of, given your constant grammatical errors and overall negative demeanor and outlook on others...Kidding around or not, the way you compose yourself on this forum is not the way a MAN in his mid 30's conducts himself; and the ones that do conduct themselves in this manner are usually those who are self-entitled, obnoxious, and coddled

TL;DR:
Some advice, to actually get others here to help... quit being a douche and actually listen, and quit with the condescending remarks

As far as the typos it is spell check on the phone I am using and can figure it out with out much problem so if no body knows why I would get readings at 40v and all lights lit but no spin of wheels then u don't and will not be the first battery I repaired that had all others stumped but every couple months I give a shot for someone with the experience to shed light but at this point I only see myself repairing these horribly manufactured batteries and if need be will just salvage all 60 cells for 1 battery I build but would rather fix it n get rid of it as these boards were for my kids but not put together good enough for even my 2 boys so want to repair better then came and sell for less than half value or worst case salvage the cells but would rather start fresh with another build then mess with these anymore as I get tired of the same thing even if working 100% and move on to the next board! Most parts are good and can be salvaged if anyone has a board they want to repair or need cells for a battery build I will sell for half price and all cells are good... just another fried bms I believe! I just don't know why reading bad and then good and not working when in the board other than the lights? Simple question for anyone that was in the same situation at least once with a battery and board

the batteries in there are also less amps and less AH than a 30Q which is the cell most of us use... the batteries used in those boards are MG1's 2850mAh and 10A discharge.... the 30Q is 3000mAh and 15A discharge, but others will say 20A realworld so yea....

Also having looked at those batteries u need to open the pack, replace the bms and inspect it for failure points in the nickle, chances are they used nickle coated strips not pure nickle

thats why i said check for shorts... usually this happens in cars a lot, you can read the battery at 12-13v all day but anytime you apply a load it will drop to almost nothing... that means tehre is a dead cell in the SLA battery... same concept here... you can have a good reading because there is enough material under no load to read full voltage, then you apply a load and the dead cell or shorted area effects the voltage

I ride with NO GEAR!!!! LOL I bought full gear for my kids but can not afford for myself at this time so my love for the boards outweighs my body getting beat but for thousands of Miles n 3 good crashes I managed to have luck on my side or at least really good reflexes and ability to get back on my feet n push through the blood... and broken bones... no visit to the hospital as duck tape and aces bandages work just as well with no hospital bills!!! Lmao... but as I said I am one of the poor kids but won't let my dream of being involved in this stop over some bruises, scrapes, or even broken bones! But do want to teach safe riding so I I am working on getting gear but repairing the board at hand is first step! Sucks being broke but I never let it stop me before!!! Can get hit by a car and be dead walking across the street... so I am going to live to my best life I can live if it means dealing with the hurdles UNTILL

Yes i believe a short POSSABLY inside the bms circuit board as all cells are like new and read good! I was hoping on finding someone that gave up on their cheap Chinese board and would be happy to see someone else get use out of their old bms or board rather than sit or go in trash! So if anyone has an old cheap koowheel/ genesis/kalifonia board they will never repair or use lmk and i will put it to use and give credit and shoutouts or whatever else... but can not see just letting hundreds of boards just collect dust cuz the company assembled the parts wrong... so anyone with a board collecting dust lmk

basically charge only means you will use the bms to charge the cells only while bypassing it to discharge... it'll really wake up the board so keep tht in mind

There was some issues with the first board we tried that with a year ago but would replace the bms with one that is for charge n discharge to avoid whatever issue we were experiencing! We installed digital battery meters and doubled up the battery and tried to bypass bms on discharge and I believe we had braking issues with the regenerative brakes... but that was about 40 projects ago! Lol
