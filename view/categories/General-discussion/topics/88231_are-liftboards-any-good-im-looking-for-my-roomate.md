Good morning everyone. So I was browsing my local marketplace on FB and noticed this board here. I have contacted the guy who owns it and he pretty much said its hardly ever been used. However I have looked on Walmart who sells these and they complain about the quality to some bit....I am mainly looking for my roommate who wants a non DIY board. I thought for 225 it cant be a bad deal but I wanted to double check with the community first. see what your guy's thoughts are on this.[here is the link for the board in question](https://www.facebook.com/marketplace/item/508116236366824/). if you have a better recommendation for the price let me know.

Tell your friend to spend a few extra bucks.

I think Meepo has good reviews and seems like a very good deal.

I wish he could but he only works 2 or 3 days out of the week. i could DIY him a board but it would be with the cheapest kit possible which is an option. i thought this would be a better option sense his income is horrible atm.

I bought one refurbished on ebay for like $100. Even at that price I regret buying. Has a lot of issues. Technically it works and is rideable but it's not very fun and probably not reliable. I had a belt wear out after like 2 rides.

I'm pretty positive the ownboard kit is $250 if he can find a deck

Do not buy the liftboard, such bad quality, and the wheels on it are shyt. The wheels are so slippery and I ate it on it. My first board was a liftboard and it was horrible, had to contact the manufacturers every week or so for new problems. He will regret buying it. Let him go for the meepo, or Ownboard. Such better quality
