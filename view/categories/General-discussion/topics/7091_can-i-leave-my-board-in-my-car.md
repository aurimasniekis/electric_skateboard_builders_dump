 OK so I was wondering if I can leave my electric longboard in my car. I have a 8s Lipo battery hooked up, would this harm it. Does it get hot enough to damage the battery? I live in the Midwest so the temperatures range from -10 to 115 degrees. And does the cold affect the board any?

Please answer for lipo and liion.

Great idea...  I got my previous e-GBomb stolen doing this at work in a locked garage! So lame.

But to actually help with your question - temp in your car in the sun will be _significantly_ higher than the outside temp.  If it's too hot for you dog, i wouldn't leave my electronics in it to bake either.  Cold shouldn't hurt it unless there's a lot of humidity and condensation.

My lesson was to just take the board into work and not leave the window cracked...

So what's the "safe" outside temperature to leave your board in your car specially with lipos?

Using the research for dogs in cars - here's how the temp inside increases over time.  I wouldn't want my board at these temps (will vary depending on outside temp - in the sun btw):

So a quick run to the store on a cool day - sure.  Sitting in your car all day at work... no thanks!

HTH - GL!

Get yourself a very heavily padded keyboard case or just wrap it in a lot of heavy blankets. That should keep your board fairly cool in comparison to outside temps. The more layers the better. When traveling, I keep my travel guitar in the trunk. All I use is a heavily padded gig bag and a few blankets on top. Even in 100 degree weather in direct sunlight, it stays decently cool for a few hours. Put a few blankets in the trunk and feel how hot it gets at the bottom of the stack after a few hours in the sun. It's not even close to as bad as your front seats that have been baking in direct sunlight.
