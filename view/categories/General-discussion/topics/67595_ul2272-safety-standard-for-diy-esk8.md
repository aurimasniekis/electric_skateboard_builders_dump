So my country is imposing that all escooters, esk8 and other personal mobility devices need to be UL2272 certified by 2021 [https://standardscatalog.ul.com/standards/en/standard_2272](https://standardscatalog.ul.com/standards/en/standard_2272).

This is on top of a whole slew of regulations hell bent on regulating the use of these devices.

However, unlike all the other regulations (speed, weight, registration, etc) which we could in one way or another comply to, how are DIYers going to comply with international safety standards?

Our DIY community just assumes it's just too expensive to bother and our hobby is going to be dead in 2 years time.

Anyone with experience with this standard and what it entails to get a DIY board certified? 

Thoughts?
Erv.

Based on the ministerial statements made publicly in parliament, devices on public paths that are non-compliant with UL2272 will be illegal. There does not appear to be a DIY exception, and in any case from the government's perspective there is no incentive to have a DIY exception because that would mean anyone could modify their PMD to be non-compliant and "escape" enforcement as it were.

Not sure dude but it might be pretty simple. Here in South Australia business needs to get a electrician in every 6 months to test and tag all electrical equipment that it is safe.

No doubt you will have a whole micro-industry pop up to service this requirement.

Did you read the standard?

>This standard is intended for evaluation of the safety of the electrical drive train system and battery and charger combination for energy and electrical shock hazards...

So basically a sparky will just waive a multi-meter over it i think? I'd just chill out dude, the sky isn't falling down :chicken:

No, it costs US$402 to get it officially from UL...

> So basically a sparky will just waive a multi-meter over it i think? I’d just chill out dude, the sky isn’t falling down :chicken:

... but if you look at the table of contents, the standards include mechanical and environmental testing. There is also a white paper available for free which describes these tests. Here is an excerpt: 

> Vibration– The vibration test determines whether the electrical system of the DUT is robust enough to withstand effects of vibration during use without resulting in loose connections or parts that could create a hazardous condition. The test utilizes a random vibration profile.

> Shock– This test determines whether or not the DUT can withstand a mechanical shock, consisting of half-sinusoidal pulses, to which a device may be subject when in use without causing an explosion, fire or rupture of the battery.

> Crush– The crush test is conducted to determine the DUT’s ability to withstand an anticipated crushing event due to specified weight limits being exceeded that could occur during use without causing an explosion or fire.

> Strain relief– The final mechanical test consists of two strain relief tests, a strain relief pull test and a push-back test, designed to assess non-detachable exposed device cords and cables that may be subjected to pulling or pushing during anticipated use.

> Environmental Testing
Environmental testing of personal e-Mobility devices includes water
exposure testing and thermal cycling. Water exposure testing includes an assessment in accordance with the requirements of IEC 60529, Degrees of Protection Provided by Enclosures (IP Code) minimally for IPX4 for exposure to splashing water, as well as a partial immersion test intended to simulate exposure to puddles of water.
Thermal cycling testing specified in UL 2272 is intended to determine the extent of an e-Mobility device’s ability to withstand exposure to rapidly changing temperatures (such as when a device enters a heated environment after being outdoors) without evidence of damage that could lead to a hazardous event.

> Material and Component Testing
Material testing of personal e-Mobility devices includes testing for flame resistance of non-metallic materials. All materials used in device enclosures must comply with the enclosure requirements detailed in UL 746C, the Standard for Safety of Polymeric Materials – Use in Electrical Equipment Evaluations. In addition, polymeric materials used in enclosures must have a minimum flame rating of V-1 as defined in UL 94, Standard for Tests for Flammability of Plastic Materials for Parts in Devices and Appliances. Flammability rating can also be assessed using the 20 mm end product flame test detailed in UL 746C.
There are also tests to evaluate the safety of a device’s motor under conditions of short circuit and overload to determine that there is no potential for overheating that could lead to a fire. The motor tests include an overload test that evaluates its ability to safely withstand a condition in which a motor is forced into a mode where it draws more than rated current, and a locked rotor test to evaluate a motor’s ability to safely withstand a condition where the rotor is prevented from moving.

This isn't a hobby for some of us.  Referring to it as such is (1) more likely to get it banned and (2) not super-considerate to those of us who use it as clean, pollution-free transportation.

So the cop going down the street sees you riding and goes "huh, I've never seen that before, I better pull him over and check his UL Safety Certification". Idk how it is where you live, but I'd never want to live in a place that acts in such a way. My experience has been more of cops don't know what your riding and it's true legality, unless what your riding is held together with duct tape. And they don't care unless you are riding dangerously. If you get in an accident, you might get in trouble. But I don't see any police just widely pulling people over and checking that what your riding is UL Certified... That's just my two cents on the issue.

Worst comes to worst, what you get some fines and realize they do care and are checking. I wouldn't let legal barriers like this stop you from doing what you know you should allowed to do (because they aren't going to hual your ass to jail for an eboard, lol).

Ride safe, ride responsibly, and you'll be fine. This will affect the complete market though, as getting completes shipped into the country is where they are likely to check for things like UL Certifications.

These standards sound tough.. well I understand the part about increasing safety n such but the one about overloading motor and not catching fire.. some really sound overdone.

For which country are these anyway?

I partly see reasoning that some china made products might be pushed to increase safety (similar like hoverboards failed and put a bad rep for many e-mobility devices).

But some of the points do sound overstressed and will make the end product unneccesarily more expensive..

Here's the article from our local news
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/motorised-pmds-ecooters-must-meet-fire-safety-standards-by-2021-10701666?cid=fbcna

Basically, it's illegal to ride on the roads in Singapore, so mobility devices like esk8s and scooters are to travel on pavements, sidewalks and park connectors. In 2016 there were 80 fire accidents, excluding the numbers from accidents from reckless riding. Scooters are very popular among the youth. They're daredevils and ride really fast and dangerous

![NP_20160924_PIX2409B_1393713|680x453](upload://bnnUVENFtS8ihfWNTcHSvIAFDwC.jpg)

Due to all the accidents that took place, the government is taking measures to 'ban' these mobility devices. Currently its focused on scooters, but with this new safety standard, it's kinda bringing down the DIY esk8 builders as well. Definitely not all scooter riders are dangerous, i've seen some who ride safe on sidewalks and around crowded areas where children are around. 

Thoughts? I'll make good use of the remaining couple of years before this new law kicks in, or hope that something will change.

Yes this is from Singapore, where the latest round of regulations puts a 10km/h speed limit when riding on pavements (roads are off the table). For what it's worth, I clocked my 3yr old scooting at 9km/h....

This new UL2272 just makes it even worse for us, DIYers/Hobbyists/Full time esk8ers/Complete Manufacturers, etc. It's just bad news for everyone, and more so for us DIYers who will almost have no means possible to get such certifications.

I personally have 4 different esk8s, that means I need 4 different certifications. Ain't nobody got time for that!

As for enforcement, we have officers with speed guns in our parks who impound scooters over the speed limit. So yes they will check, and I don't want to feel like a damn criminal just because I cannot certify my DIY esk8.

New laws now include possible jail time actually... but this is more for reckless riding in my opinion.

I do however not wish for my boards to be impounded and not get them back because of the UL certification issue. There's a chance this will happen, as it is they stop people on the pavements, weigh and measure the scooters to make sure they are compliant. Non-compliance means off to the impound you go to be destroyed.

Government just wants money.  We all take away billions(not just eskate) in tax money generated from gas tax, licencing tax, registration and fines.  So if you can't have fun on your whatever more money for them.

I have seen this coming. I will say it now if this community doesn’t promote the benefits of this form of transportation regulations will be put in place by people who don’t care. 

Prompt safety in PPE 
Talk to the city and county. 
Local representative 
If we are all quiet they will do what they want. 
If you esk8 you have a responsibility to do what you can to educate your local officials and explain how this technology is the future of transportation. We must take the label (hazard) off and open eyes

Im interested in how this goes as well. Im pretty sure there are many small retailers that are selling E-scooters and such on the web and Industrial area. Im also pretty sure that the ruling will only affect retailers or importers to get the UL certification before they are allowed to sell them. Meaning we DIY-ers or hobbiest are not included. I cant imagine if a POLY student wants to create a e-Scooter for FYP and they have to go through UL Certification. Totally not practical and who's going to pay for the cost? The school, project Supervisor or the students themselves?

Just my 2 cents worth here.

The law does state that repeat offenders for not complying will potentially get jail time, and that the government will be outsourcing officers to specifically stop you and check your ride

I understand that. But you have to remember it’s not about empathy it’s about our rights. 
Besides. If your in the USA the current administration could really care. I think esk8 regulations are the least of their concerns. 
UL required testing comes from Washington.

Unfortunately electronic mobility device regulations IS one of the main hot button topics in our country. 

Because of the black sheep which were caught speeding in excess of 100km/h, very public viral news about accidents involving kids, very vocal anti-escooter activists, poorly informed consumers who overcharged their batteries resulting in fires, etc etc etc...

Basically the administration is promoting a "car-lite" environment but also wants to make sure the whole escooter craze doesn't get people hurt.

It's really not so much about the benefits of it, it's more about how to circumvent all the possible negative results of this new technology. Our current way is to slap on regulation after regulation after regulation...

Here is the thing, who is riding a board they made three years ago? Imagine where the technology will be at in three+ years time?
With regulation it will provide a environment of greater security for business to invest in the industry. Imagine where we could be in 5 years time with such a environment and backing?

Can't do much but wait and see, I don't think it looks like doom & gloom.

I feel like people aren't reading the article linked by Linny upthread. 

The problem is not the requirement for certification in itself, but rather, who has to comply that requirement?

If it is just the manufacturer, that's fine. That's a reasonable target. If you extend it, and say that importers and distributors cannot deal in non-certified products, that's again fine, that's a logical extension. There's also a grace period for vendors to get rid of existing stock. 

But what was announced is that uncertified PMDs will be illegal to ride on the roads:

> Devices on public paths which are not UL2272 compliant will be illegal from January 2021, said Dr Lam. 
> For retailers, the Government intends to prohibit them from selling non-compliant motorised PMDs from July 2019.
> Existing users of devices which do not meet the standard can continue using them until end-2020. The grace period is to facilitate the introduction of UL2272 as a technical standard, said Dr Lam. 

We'll have to wait to see the actual language of the amended rules, but in Singapore, when a senior minister of state in the relevant ministry (ministry of transport) makes a public statement on what is or is not going to be enacted as law, and that bill that is to be enacted is currently before parliament, you can be fairly sure that what was said will mirror what is to come.

Which means that yes, you are going to have enforcement teams on the roads catching riders. Like they already do: see this article with pictures of the enforcers, who have speed guns to measure your speed and who have scales to measure the weight of the PMD you are riding: 

https://www.tnp.sg/news/singapore/using-speed-guns-catch-errant-pmd-users

Say what you will about the Singapore Government, they are fairly efficient at setting this kind of thing up. 

All this background is to set the context for why OP has phrased his original post the way he has. How does a hobbyist go about getting UL2272 certified? Has anyone tried? plz halp! 

That the requirement will be imposed is a foregone conclusion, though I continue to hold out hope that the detailed implementation will contain sufficient carveouts and exceptions for hobbyists, students, and other DIY enthusiasts. 

I also think the requirement is generally a good thing, unless you're an arsonist.

I see. Regardless of where you are regulation is coming in one form or another. 
Safety and information is key. 
As a community this should be promoted to the max to help. 
If a group can’t regulate its self someone will step in. 
It’s up to the individual to inform themselves, the industry manufacturers and resellers to provide quality products and information for them. 
A better informed rider who know his equipments limits is safer and more responsible for his and others safety. 
There will always be some fool that will take it to far and get someone seriously hurt. 
Being prepared is a good start.

i Completely agree with what you’ve said about safety and limits of equipment, but this law is essentially killing the diy scene, making it impossible for us to ride our creations anywhere but privately owned land, which Singapore has almost non of.

Yes, the whole situation in Germany is quite disappointing. The lack of responsibility in the individual first is to blame fallowed by cheep components and products. 
Then there are the scooter companies dropping  scooters on the streets of major cities with no regard to safety and what could happen. 
Regulation on a local level has begun. 

It not just your right to be able to do this. Responsibility must have its place or we will all soon suffer the consequences. 
I do hope in the future WE AS A COMMUNITY promote the benefits of this TECHNOLOGY and just how profound the impact can be.......
This is what will get this plant off fossil fuels.

And this is why I'll never leave San Francisco... Cops here could care less about it, never heard or seen any police stopping and checking out PEVs for legality. My e-board is illegal, and so is my e-bike. Never been stopped in the 1000's of miles I've done in the past 3 years. The laws however, are there so when they feel someone did something dangerous and a cop sees it, they can nail you for it. If your reasonable about your riding, they will either smile and give you a thumbs up. Or not care.
