Seeing that marcmount wheels fit both AliExpress’s 6x2 tyres and bergmeister tyres I take it that bergmeister tyres will fit the AliExpress wheels?

Is my logic elementary my dear Watson or hideously flawed?

Well, the aliexpress tyres fit berg rims, i'm assuming it'll be safe to assume the opposite is true too. I will be able to help you confirm in 8 hours when I get home.

Just curious, why would you not want to use berg rims with their tyres?

edit: yes, Bergmeister tires work on the AliExpress 6x2 wheel, too. 

likewise, 6x2 on Bergmeister rims:

Purely financial... got the Ali rims on my board already. I’m very happy with the cheapo 6 x 2 tyres they work well on and off road as long as it’s not too muddy. The only reason to change rubber is if the bergmeister tyres give better range. I’m averaging around 35Wh / mile with 50% trails and limited high speed. If I tank around on roads at 30mph with lots of hard acceleration that goes up to 44Wh /mile.
