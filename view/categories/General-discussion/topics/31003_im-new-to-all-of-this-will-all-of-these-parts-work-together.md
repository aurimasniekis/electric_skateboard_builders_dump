For that price, you should just get a VESC, also I'm not sure if that ESC even has brakes..

The 6364 motor likely has the same stator size as the 6355's, just with a longer body. It might be more worth it to step up to a 6374 motor.

Alright, what would you say about this one:

And I have changed the motor to this:

Might want to pick up some XT-90S for a loop key as well.

I'm sorry to sound silly, but what is a loop key?

There's a ton of things you can find in the search feature, but here's a good topic to start on.

Basically, it's an on/off switch for your board that will work like a car key.

One question, the VESC says it has 5.5mm bullet connectors for the motor, but the motor has 4mm. Will I have to get a different motor?

No, you'll just have to solder on either new motor connectors or new VESC connectors. Either way is good.

Or you could buy these.

 I did. But then I ended up switching out the wires on my tacon Bigfoot 160 because the stock wires were too stiff for my liking.
