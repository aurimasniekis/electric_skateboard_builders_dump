Yeah, having that problem with the FatBoy antispark right now. Didn't realise that it'll draw 0.5W on while my board was off, 10s3p batt almost died from it, from 2 weeks of being idle.

Do you guys think that computers on standby also don't consume power until you turn it on? ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Maybe earth is flat too?

10s3p 30q is a month not a two weeks (333Wh/0.5Wh = ~28 days) if you storing your board for these kind of periods if I were u I would disconnect battery from everything...

0.5W though? That's like 10 mA of leakage current. Really bad, I assume your switch doesn't leak that badly?

It's not leaking anything it's power consumption on off state (vreg and logic) 5mA

Are you saying that an expensive power switch should leak 5ma? I'm pretty confused. All I know is if I designed a power switch then realised it consumed that much in off state I'd bin the design and start over.

Exactly. The unity doesnt consume any power (or neglible power consumption) even after leaving my board idle for 2 weeks.. I'd say that 0.5W of idle consumption is too much, but to each his own.

Do you store your board at 42V? Facepalm.

I said my 10s3p got drained to 0 in 2 weeks. No where did I state that it was from a full charge because I sure as hell don't store my boards at full charge. 

Edit: I have over 10 boards and hence store them at 60% charge for each to preserve battery life. It is obvious that there are times where I neglect riding some boards for weeks or months at end, and having a passive 0.5W drain isn't ideal. I can't imagine being alone in this dilemma. I'm sure there are some who are sesonal riders and don't ride in the winter.

It's not a matter of whether it consumes power, it's a matter of how much it consumes and what an acceptable limit is.

1. The first batch of Unitys have been delivered. I own one.

2. That isn't the point. We're merely pointing out that a drain of 0.5W is too high on idle. If you don't want to anything about it, that's fine. 

Side note, your attitude regarding this matter is really off putting. I find you constantly critizing designs of others (e.g. flipsky), but when someone brings up a concern on one of your designs, you get super defensive. Not cool.

Well I'm glad I clicked on this thread. 0.5w passive drain for a power switch is worthy of notice when purchasing especially on what would be considered a high end item. Draining $300 packs dry in a month is way no bueno. I have a couple of these for future projects, and certainly would have made sad and angry faces at some point had I not seen your post.

Thanks @nuttyjeff I consider your post a PSA.

@Kug3lis you owe your customers better. At least a warning. It's hard to continue to support your products if you don't share stuff like this.
 
@goldenHusky sorry for cluttering your thread. I'm excited to see the pre-charge circuit. I wasn't sure if I was being dumb when I made this post 

https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/new-open-source-antispark-switch/82154/32?u=deucesdown

EDIT

Adding some math.
0.5w at say 10s fully charged is .5w/42v == 0.012a.
4p 30q pack is 3000mah*4 == 12ah.
12ah / 0.012a == 1000hr.
1000hr / 24h = 41.67 days to drain down to 0% (about 6 weeks).

I'm afraid this forum needs a new rule against "customer bashing", can't believe these rude words.

@nuttyjeff I just checked the voltage on my 10s4p with connected standard vedder antispark switch. I didn't ride the board since 5 months and the total voltage decreased max. 0.2V - 0.4V, could be even less.

On my MTB I have a 3way directFET antispark switch from @goldenHusky (I pull up to 100A on 12s, works great) and I didn't ride for 2 months, too. There is no noticeable voltage drop (maybe 0.1V or less).

That's the first time I read that an antispark switch drains a battery within weeks. This is very bad and should not exist.

For people who use these as tools and not toys, boards get stored "charged".  Do you store your car with all the gasoline drained out?  Fuck no... because you might need it at any moment...

So if a system can't be stored at full charge, then it's defective for my purposes.  A car that couldn't be parked with more than a half-tank would be defective also.

Sure, if a board breaks down I won't charge it until it's repaired.  But to suggest that storing these uncharged is normal or correct is hilarious.  I don't make these to look at, I make them to ride.

I store most of my boards at 60% simply because I have alot of them and storing them at full overtime damages the cells. (Correct me if i'm wrong). Would you then advise me to store them all at full charge...?

As far as I know, cars can be stored at a full tank of gas or half a tank without any detrimental effects, the analogy falls short there.

If your boards aren't ready to ride, then they are toys.

When you use these as transportation, you will understand.

It's no different than having a car that takes 3 hours to start.  It's not practical.  If a battery can't be stored full, then it's a shitty battery.  Shitty batteries exist.  Maybe that's one reason I like LiFePO4.

I don't understand what to share? How the fck do you expect a device to stay in stand by mode and listen when the board starts pushing or **momentary button** is pressed and turn everything on, not the latching switch which turns on everything and keeps the power on but is dumb as fck as it doesn't have any logic at all. Yes, I could have made it eat no current at all, but would you pay a few times more for it? No, you would all cry how it is super expensive and shit. Efficient parts dc/dc converters and etc cost money, and you guys always complaining that everything is expensive so for god sake please don't cry.

I am not sure but every switch which uses momentary button and something like PTS will have the same issue.

No wonder people are leaving this place. You can consider me switching off pretty soon too, as I am not going to share my thousands of hours of programming and designing on ESC with this community which will just find another thing to complain about.

I don't know the previous history why you think like that. I'm sure many people appreciate you hard work and like your products. I personally never had items from you but I'm sure they are good quality. And you had a title :wink:

I heard your switch is reliable, didn't know it starts when pushing which is great.
I think the main point is that customers should know about the fact that they MUST disconnect the battery e.g. in winter break. I just imagine someone coming back home after 3 weeks holidays and the battery is dead :unamused:

oh @Kug3lis , why so angry?
just understand our site too.
we are no engineers and don¬¥t understand things like that.
how can we know how much energy your switch use on standby? ... I should now start to research data sheets of components you used? come on... not really please.
Is it a big problem to add a small notification on your website? one sentence "disconnect from battery when not charging for more than 2 weeks" and you save out of any claims. 
If people don¬¥t read it, it¬¥s there problem.

I¬¥m sure people appreciate your work and the work of your paps.
you can read it here multiple times!
It¬¥s up to you on which comments you set your focus.
There always fanboys and hater. That¬¥s not only in this community.
You created what you think is how it should be with all your products. If other people don¬¥t like it or say something about the design than you can just ignore it, or have a look if there is some truth in it and you can improve your product.
No need to get crazy about it.

This switch is not full disconnect from battery its device which helps you to turn on/off board quicker than other ways.

In normal occasion you will have BMS which would protect your battery from full discharge and full mechanical disconnect from the battery for storing long term.

The device consumes less or around 5mA which in normal uses cases shouldn't disturb much of your daily usages and in long term you always want to disconnect your battery from any switch as they can not be trusted. What if when you storing your board for long term and randomly MOSFET dies because of manufacturer issue and your 3kW battery pack shorts and burns your apartment to the ground? I wouldn't trust any device connected to big battery packs without supervision and protections.

Yes it was our mistake of not mentioning this kind of detail, but like I mentioned before in normal configuration and usage this kind of power consumption would not matter much. You can't have all together.

P.S. Battery disconnect is most important feature in any project it can be car, bike, board or any other electric device u always must have a quick way to disconnect power from everything in case of emergency.

Guys, please, let's pause for a moment.

Whether or not a 0.5W draw for an always-on standby switch is appropriate for esk8 is purely subjective.

This is not a design flaw, or boon.  It simply is what it is.  3DServisas has stated they omitted this detail and that's understandable.

The question should simply be, is there a bypass requested in the next version for people who wish to store their boards, long-term and not use them.

Thank you, team.  This is a good post, we do not need emotions - just solutions.  

I own one and I've never thought to leave my board sitting that long - yet thanks for the reminder for me to charge my bikes, because they've been sitting all winter.

An MCU can cost less than a few dollars to add to a BOM. Especially if they're fire and forget.

In device manufacturing at any quantity, it's king.

MCUs can do a lot for very little, I have found they save time and effort again and again as they often allow for simple yet smart design choices at a minimal cost to BOM. Unless you're talking about the firmware development, which I consider negligible with this level of complexity of device.

Well yes, but manpower and etc things cost money too. Some device design would cost more than BOM for 1M devices ;) Everyone can buy a part but not everyone can make that part work like intended and specialist get paid to do it.

Try to explain that to any EE company by telling it is just a simple switch or any other professional engineering company that it is pretty simple.

Let's not discuss this any further as this topic is completely not related to the issue.

We already have solution for this but at the moment to throw away whole stock is not wise so maybe in future we will update it. Right now it works like it should, and many people have no issues with it.

By responding to this, you're inviting discussion. Unless you're saying you just don't want to discuss this within this thread. Either way I'll just say this:

So you don't think I'm entirely talking opinion out my ass: 

I lead hardware development for a device technology company for my day job. I disagree, but the MCU vs static/passive design argument is often a generational one. Personally, I wouldn't consider running a modern 'EE company' without an embedded engineer on staff.

I bet most do. 

A note stating how much it drains is all I need and then be done with it.

Why are you guys so frickin angry?..... most commercial lion products run flat within 30 days anyway, the boosted V1 is a good example if the battery got low because you either left it at 100% and it drained to 0% or you rode it to 40% and left it there for a month then there would have been no way to charge it except forcing current through the motors to charge the a123 cells. (or just send the board to get replaced)

if you don't check up on your eboards often (1-2 weeks) then your asking for a disaster... or if you're super worried just buy one of those storage voltage maintainers.

^or i just sound super dumb

It's not only esk8 technology is in it's infancy - some vendors are also. And that has nothing to do with cutting edge technology.

The feeling that i'm doing a favor to a vendor buying their highlighly premium/expensive products kills me.

This switch is not full disconnect from battery its device which helps you to turn on/off board quicker than other ways.

In normal occasion you will have BMS which would protect your battery from full discharge and full mechanical disconnect from the battery for storing long term.

The device consumes less or around 5mA which in normal uses cases shouldn‚Äôt disturb much of your daily usages and in long term you always want to disconnect your battery from any switch as they can not be trusted. What if when you storing your board for long term and randomly MOSFET dies because of manufacturer issue and your 3kW battery pack shorts and burns your apartment to the ground? I wouldn‚Äôt trust any device connected to big battery packs without supervision and protections.

Yes it was our mistake of not mentioning this kind of detail, but like I mentioned before in normal configuration and usage this kind of power consumption would not matter much. You can‚Äôt have all together.

P.S. Battery disconnect is most important feature in any project it can be car, bike, board or any other electric device u always must have a quick way to disconnect power from everything in case of emergency.

This is the perfect response, and I believe would have made everyone happy (along with a note on the product listing on the website). Thank you!

That temper tantrum that preceded this though... I don't think I need to add anything....

@martinsp should consider my above circuit in his future revs, he can add a diode branch for the P2S feature.

Power conssumption if the off position should be as low as possible, it is not normal to drain a battery when an item is not in use

I recently swapped out my Spud's antispark and rolled back to an XT90AS after I found out my 10S2P pack had drained to zero when left idle.

I tried two different antispark switches, both leaked or rather consumed power when off.

Both were brand new... Ironically my older generation ones never exhibited this problem thus I never expected this to be an issue.

So yah if the switch is going to consume power when it's off. At least let the consumer know.

Hello everyone, 
I just got back from the shop and read my emails, been a bit too busy past few days. I will reply to all my PMs in the morning.
I will also do the measurements, Im planning to measure what I would consider the worst case scenario of what you described. Measure the input current/power from the battery while the switch is OFF and the output of the switch is shorted to include leakage current. If youd like to see something measured let me know so I can do it...

The switch will consume power all the time, that simply is because there is a micro-controller that needs to be powered so it can respond to the input (push button for example). The only way you could get absolute zero current is by using relays because mosfets have leakage current when OFF and no active micro-controller just a push button that when closed energizes the coils. I was thinking about such a design because it is simple and pretty bullet proof as far as the switch goes but it would be very bulky for electric skateboard needs...

EDIT: just measured it here are the results: https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/push-to-start-switch-out-now/60879/195?u=martinsp

I think the ideal solution would be something like the unity has. A momentary push button antispark solution with negligible power consumption.

[quote="nuttyjeff, post:12, topic:85036"]
It‚Äôs not a matter of whether it consumes power, it‚Äôs a matter of how much it consumes and what an acceptable limit is.
[/quote]

^ I don't know the ins and outs of how this works, but I'd implore the antispark designers of the community to work towards this implementation.  I mean no offence to anyone, i simply **think** that the current AS switches can be improved, seeing as there is already one out there that does the job perfectly. (The only issue is that you have to buy 2 vescs along with it and for those running a 1WD build, it's not a viable option.)

As for the current AS switches that consume a noticable about of power, it'll be nice to leave a note on your website (or wherever) to indicate its power drain. There are some with small battey packs (think 20 cells or lesser) who use your anti-sparks, and 0.5W or similar of power drain is quite unacceptable. (I'm not saying Martinsp's switch drains 0.5W, will wait on his reply on the power drain of his switch)

@Martinsp Thanks for steping into the discussion, would love to hear your thoughts on it.

Is this consumption of power only for the PTS style switches only or even the older generation ones?

I have two of your switches. The old one with the big automotive fuse and a newer generation (non-PTS). Old one works fine. New one killed my 10S2P apparently.
