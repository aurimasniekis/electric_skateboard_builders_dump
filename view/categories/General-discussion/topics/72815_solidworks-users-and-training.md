Hey all,

Just wanted to throw this out there real quick, how many people on here use solidworks and what was the best way to start learning it?

My future "company" just got approved for the entrepreneur license and I want to take my hand drawn/designed deck and render it perfectly so I can have a CNC cut out my mold.

I am just installing the software now and started watching some youtube tutorials but I was wondering if there was a better place to get the info I need! 

If there a good training program for solidworks or is it more trial by fire with learning it?

I use solidworks, not an expert by any means.  I typically google and youtube stuff when I run into a block.  Here are some decent training resources that our engineers have used in the past.

I just knew you would be one of the first to respond.

I've been hobbling together a bunch of freeware stuff and its just not cutting it now that I'm trying to get the fine details together.

I got all these links bookmarked and I'm going to start digging through them, Thanks!!

My personal experience is the best way is to learn Fusion 360 ;)

@Itsmedant

I've been using Solidworks for too long and its a love hate relationship. To begin with trial and error does take you forward in learning basic extrusions and part assemblies but if you want to go into areas like rendering and shoddy flow software I recommend tackling each problem you come across by first going to a youtube walkthrough and then follow the links I have posted below. I will say that Solidworks can be stressful and particularly difficult at the best of times so if you have any questions please feel free to ask me on the forum as sometimes Solidworks problems can be hard to solve. Best of luck!

Below are a few resources that have saved me time:

Ok to give something more..... I used Solidworks for last 3 years and like @Fraserrazor mentioned it's a love-hate relationship. Fusion is simpler and for my needs more than enough. If don't plan to work with a team of people on some complicated projects Fusion will be enough. Solidworks has also painful previous versions compatibility restrictions which are annoying and aim at money grab in my opinion.

I started out in inventer and solid works in highschool. I was forced to learn it because no one else was learning it to CAD our robot. But I will say this if you don't keep up with it for a long period of time you will forget it. So keep practicing that's all I can say.

I applied to fusion as well, they never responded back to me! I'm going to try and figure this thing out, You think deck design is better done in fusion though?

Creo is free for students.  It is more powerful and has a more robust feature set than Solidworks.  Creo is considered high-end software, while Solidworks is middle-of-the-road

Creo is basically the standard in the aerospace world, and I use it practically every day.  Going back to Solidworks when I was in grad school made me go like this... :face_with_symbols_over_mouth: :scream: :triumph: :sob:

I'm a daily SW user and would recommend you stick with learning it for use with most mid range projects. It's quick to learn, it's UI is very visually based, and like you mentioned there are ample tutorials online for free.  Im well versed in Creo too. The program really excels in higher complexity projects. It forces better modeling practice and its crashes are less catastrophic than in SW, but Creo has a much steeper learning curve, is wildly click heavy, and you can't build in multi solid-body in part files. Unless you plan to use it daily for a long time, stick with SW or Fusion.

For someone that has been sitting in Catia V5 for a couple of years. How big of a learning curve would solidworks be? Is there even any benefits from swapping?

I was under the impression that solidworks would be out of my price range. My coworker told me the site license per seat was prohibitively high (~4k). Maybe there is an hobbyist price plan?

I did an application process for an entrepreneur license. Had to talk to them over the phone about what I was going to use it for and what my plans for my company were going to be. They reviewed it and I got full access for free for 12 months.

I haven't tried Fusion and Creo, been on Blender then Solidworks for quite some time. 

Can't agree more with what has been posted above! Actually if you manage to think "outside the box" Sw is wonderful for quick work builds, even more if you need them CNC'd (with obvious limitations from CNC engineering).

I'd like to give a shot to Creo but if it isn't as *simple* as Sw I'll have to pass. How is Fusion 360 guys?

[/quote]

I haven't really used anything else. I have used it since March 2018 from knowing nothing from CAD.

I first tried SW but it didn't seem easy to grasp for me. Switched to Fusion360 and felt comfortable using it instantly. I haven't really looked back, there's always new updates with nice new features

I tried installing Creo but the installation process is lengthy, well more than Fusion anyway.

Catia is the most powerful but also most painful. I prefer catia for complex surfacing and solidworks for simple products and 2D drawings. It is really easy to learn compared to catia I think. For large assemblies, catia is way better/smoother while solidworks lags.

I can agree that Catia is far superior than solidworks and is extensively used in industry. However, it is still super expensive :disappointed_relieved:

Another option is siemens NX, which I believe have the best parts of sw and catia combined. But I have barely used it so I cannot say for sure. Also expensive as the others, but catia takes the cake in that regard, completely bonkers how expensive it is!

Hehe, once a year pops that email with a free student license. Then 1 week later its back to 100â‚¬ 

Its really stupid from dassault systems that they dont focus on students as those are their future users

I found the best way to learn quickly is to have an "expert" nearby, while working on something real. Whenever you get to a road block and can't figure it out on your own you call them over and say how do I do this?

This works for any 3D CAD software. 

If that is not available just replace "expert" with a youtube search.

just sign up as a student and get autocad fusion ultimate and bunch of other stuff for free
for your rest of your schooling
then just make another account and you have like 3-4 more years
you can probably get other stuff for free as well

Solidworks :heart_eyes:

In my Uni they use Siemens NX, and so in the BAJA team we also used it, I fought for 3 years  until we changed to Solidworks

Nx is a really powerful tool, but it's like to kill a fly with a nuclear warhead and really hard for people that never touched CAD before, specially when the teachers haven't a clue how to do things in it

I like Solidworks since it has pretty advanced features without polluting everything with PLM and other modules that for single user use aren't needed

Also I got a free life time license :pirate_flag:

The pirate flag should give a hint, but only for personal use

But they do have an academic license, the only problem is that the license file has to be installed on a campus server and you have to connect via VPN to use it, since a lot of time I use without an internet connection it's not an option

I can't speak for Catia, but my understanding of it is that it makes very few mathematical assumptions similar to Creo/ProE - Making these programs great when highly precise equation driven compound helix/sweeps/lofts are required for like turbine blades and aircraft wings and such that require G5 or more surface continuity.  Solidworks on the other hand is great for most consumer-product-level and below complexity drafting because it DOES make mathematics assumptions (though sometimes I wish I had a little more control). Because of this it means things can be done quicker as they require less inputs. That said, it is still a different program and visual platform, so it's like learning a new language. The plus side is that once you've locked that in, it is highly efficient for mid-level complexity builds.

Did you get an official licence? You can't design anything you plan to sell unless you have the full licence. Take the tutorials that solidworks has built in, otherwise just watch a ton of YouTube. Titans of CNC has some good stuff about cnc work too if you need
