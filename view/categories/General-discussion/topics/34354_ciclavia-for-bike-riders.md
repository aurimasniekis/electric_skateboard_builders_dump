anyone near LA, there's another CicLAvia coming up, this time in downtown.  the city closes down a portion of the city so people ride their bikes up and down otherwise busy streets.

it's literally on my street now so if anyone wants to cruise, let's <strike>meet up</strike> form a public assembly.

it's kind of a strange route, in a cross pattern.  the 2nd street route, between grand and hill is a pretty serious uphill section, so it might be a good time to put your board through some trials.

I'll have to pass on this till my board gets a major upgrade even though it's a 15-20 minute drive from my house.

I'm at college and broadway so that'd be idea but could easily go anywhere else along the route. 

area with easiest parking most likely.
