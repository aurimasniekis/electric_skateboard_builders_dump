He wanted someone to tell the forum that he‚Äôs suspended so anyone that has a pending sale with him doesn‚Äôt panic.

@GrecoMan sorry man! That was fallout from the huge # of flags in another thread. I was on mobile and was trying to just close it up until I could figure out what was going on!

What's with all the censorship lately? I thought this was the internet. Comments are being flagged and deleted for simple disagreements. Deleting posts is for spam, not opinions. If Greco is getting suspended, something is wrong. 

I'm sure this post will disappear momentarily.

In summery it looks like a noob came in, talking about esc's and nothing about skateboards, and when asked about skateboards he got butthurt and started flagging all of the replied to his silly thread that he didn't like..the result was a little ban for gecco...yay, now we can all go back to our normal business...not even any good drama in this one...

Posts are hidden when another member flags a comment. A mod reviews each flagged comment and decides whether it really should be deleted or not. I'd say, after doing it for a few years, that it is about 50/50 - half the flags are legit, and the other half are flags that are based on anger or disagreement. 

For the public record - @GrecoMan grecoman was not ever meant to be suspended - that was my error  - was on a mobile platform. I'm human I'm sorry! I fixed it within a few minutes. 

Yes, pls return to business as usual...

Well, if the T-shirt is the hold up, I propose @Grecoman just have those words tattooed on each of his shoulders and get lifetime B-boxes with the requirement of going shirtless the rest of his life. 

Exception: Sleeveless crop tops or belly shirts are acceptable for special occasions like job interviews, church or weddings.

Here's a thought: how about you sell the vescs and give the money to @bimmer "most generous when drunk". Then he makes the t-shirt for you. A good trade and everybody's happy :slight_smile:.
