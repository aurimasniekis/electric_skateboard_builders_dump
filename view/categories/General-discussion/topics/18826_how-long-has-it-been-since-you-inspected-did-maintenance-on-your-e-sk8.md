Just a fun question! How many miles/km has it been since you last tightened/loosened a screw/opened your enclosures on your e-board? Basically how many miles/km has it been since you last got the tools out to either maintain or inspect the functioning of your e-board. (Excluding taking your cover off for charging if your board requires it). Only DIY boards please. 

I'll get the ball rolling:

5 km ago (earlier today), to tighten a loose motor mount screw. 

Very curious to hear from all of you

I check mine out (wheels, bearings, belts, enclosure, electronics, batteries, etc.) every week.  It only takes about 10 mins at this point.

I have got my Lipo board to the point where I don't really check it. Just charge the battery and ride. I have had it for about 8 months and have never changed a belt, tightened a bolt, or greased a bearing. I made sure that when I did it, i did it right. Was about a 5 month build.

That's hard to say, depending other things (work, kids, etc.) I might ride 5 or 50 miles in a week.  I just like to keep an eye on things that can go BOOM! :slight_smile:

I check before OR after each ride, but just by wiggling the wheels and motor with my hands to make sure nothing is loose

Honestly My main board never gets inspections anymore. It just works, haven't had to do anything to it in months

always check before you ride....no exceptions!

Some boards need a few adjustments in the beginning...but should settle in to a point where nothing is moving around and really all you need to do is check the belts and make sure the wheels spin free...
i havent had to change a belt in a year

At least 100 Km, but i have a bad bearing in my motor that i'm to lazy to replace since it's a pain to remove, the replacements are in my desk staring at me for more than a month :grin:

I usually wipe down and quickly look over my board after each ride.  Most of the time its nothing but a clean.
But sometimes there is a nut or bolt that is coming loose. Its always good to check, remember your life is at stake here.

I found with my first board when i put it together i would do a short ride and lose a nut or something thats when I learnt the NUMBER ONE RULE of e-skate! Locktite EVERYTHING.
From then on I would go 800km without service.  Thats about how long until a belt snapped.

@lowGuido that seems to be my main problem also... For me, even high strength Loctite doesn't always do it. Rethreading some of my holes today to hopefully improve things..

I feel! Things are pretty slow for me right now too.. Constant problems, but hopefully they'll iron themselves out:)

If you keep having problems, use 648 loctite ;)
It¬¥s like welding and you have to post some pictures and call me if something is still moving after that! :monkey:

Once a day for belt tension and kingpin nuts.

Once a week for an overall inspection.

I was riding one time back home from work, noticed the front was a bit too easy to turn but no problem, got home and had a look and the roadside nut was literally half off the bolt. Would not have been fun had it fell off when riding at 40kmh so I inspect it every day along with belt tension. ( Bought Loctite that afternoon :confused: )

Minor service once a month. Check bearing, wheel, battery connector, wire, truck, and all the screw. 
Around two months will check vesc conection and motor connection. 
Every week will do some cleaning on weekend. 
I love my board

I've used strong locklite and haven't found any loose screw...almost a year that I start with my board...some bearing cleaning every month, and check mount and belt integrity...happens that I put a GoPro filming gear system and found that the belt was "jumping"...a little stone got in the belt and I haven't noticed...what I'm looking to do is a deep motor maintance...does anybody can give some tips to open and proper clean a motor...mine is a torqueboard ;)

Just remove the pulley, remove the circlip and pull the can, just be cautious to not get your finger caught, the magnets hold the motor with a lot of force

I check them when it's been suspiciously long since that board last broke

Otherwise I react to malfunctions only.  If a board needs inspection before each ride, it's broken in my opinion.  You wouldn't consider a car that needs inspection before each ride to be quality, either
