Because of how nice @chaka is.

Renders-Smenders .... put urs on a cocktail napkin, I bet its up there.... what‚Äôs more important is what components you use, how you use them based on the ride you want to create.

The pictures were meant to help visualize the parts list as a complete board. We know looks mean shit. It‚Äôs all about the ride.

Post up punk. Don‚Äôt lay down to @GrecoMan.
