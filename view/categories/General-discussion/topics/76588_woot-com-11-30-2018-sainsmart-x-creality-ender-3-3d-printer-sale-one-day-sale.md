Of note, I don't have any experience with 3D printers.  I don't know what's best.  I don't know if this is any good.  Just thought I'd share.  If you've ever done woot before, it's today (11/30/20108) only.

It is a great entry level printer from what Iâ€™ve read about it. And for that price...I would recommend that anyone that does already have a printer pick it up.
