It is no secret that a certain snowboarding helmet has quickly invaded the esk8 scene for aesthetic reasons alone. Unfortunately this helmet is cheaply made with a plastic shell and offers very little protection against a concussion because plastic will not crush like a helmet made from composite fiber, the plastic shell causes the helmet to bounce during hard impacts. Another point of contention is this helmet is not really a full face. Sure the little bendy plastic bit covering your food hole will protect you from a slap to the face while on the slopes but it will likely compress into your teeth if you smack the asphalt at high speed. 

Be safe, do some research and use gear designed for the sport. Asphalt is not powder, get a real full face helmet with rated protection.

I thought that the Certain helmet you are speaking of is certified in the EU for skating.

Now I recently fell in one of those said helmets and posted about it on Reddit, I got knocked unconscious but it was an extremely hard fall because of a front pnumatic wheel locking up at close to 30mph. The helmet split but I feel that it saved my life I have no permanent head injuries and I can skate another day.

We're talking about the Ruroc helmets that have been promoted here by some esteemed forum members. We've had group buys and discount codes.

So whats the deal? Is it safe or not?

the only Ruroc helmet which is certified as a full face (include the mouth guard) is the upcoming Ruroc Atlas. The rest are "just" fancy snowboarding helmets. It does not mean they are bad and will not save your life; especially compared if you don't wear one. It's just that if you take safety seriously and ride on asphalt at speed, you're only wise choice is a certified full face helmet.

Fair enough. 6 -12 months ago there was a reasonable percentage of people on this forum not even wearing a cap on their heads when they skated. We've come a long way and if the biggest concern we have right now is that people are wearing the wrong full face helmets I feel we're going in the right direction still!

Definitely mate. Now they just need further education to move to the next level, which is to move from mainstream fanciness hype to safety. Ruroc lovers will find this in the Atlas which is a cool looking helmet.

I would wager that if you had a helmet made using a composite and designed to compress/crush on impact you would not have been knocked out. Sure anything is better than nothing but if you are paying top dollar for a popular helmet a new rider will assume they are getting a proper helmet for the sport.

To add insult to injury this helmet greatly reduces your field of vision so in special circumstances one could say wearing nothing could in fact be better than wearing this helmet if the lack of peripheral vision led to being tagged by a vehicle you didn't see coming.

I still remember turning you guys on to full face dh helmets for esk8 years ago! In my opinion mtb dh helmets are at the forefront right now.  I might purchase a mtb helmet with MIPS and add a lens next, my current helmet is getting a little ripe.

What is MIPS?

Believe it or not, a helmet designed for skateboarding is not suitable for esk8. Typically a helmet designed for skateboarding is for taking falls at the skatepark not for riding at 20 to 30+ mph. Skatepark helmets do not absorb the impacts we see when riding at high speed. 

So to be fair we could say this company is attempting to deceive us as consumers since they are in fact marketing these helmets for use in esk8

Your change of avatar threw me for a loop there. Anyway, I thought part of the hype with Ruroc is that you had a nice wide FoV? Obviously I don't own one but do you not?

@brenternet Same with most if not all motorcycle helmets? The certified ones that you want are usually the one where you don't generally have a nice FoV.

Are the helmets posted higher up have better sights? And I assume TSG has both good FoV and safety requirements met?

If you expect the protection of a full face helmet designed for impacts at moderate to high speeds then yes you should look into getting another helmet for esk8. If you don't mind headaches, concussions and obstructed peripheral vision stick with what you have!

Last season I saw a snowboarder with a black ruroc and my god that was one sexy helmet. This is before they kinda blew up on this forum so it was the first time I'd seen one. Rode the lift with the guy, he was chill

No the field of view is not good towards the road looking down. You will actually need to tilt your head downwards to get a good look at your feet. I definitely had to get use to that. 
From left to right I’d say the fov is pretty good. 

The tsg however has excellent fov from both top to bottom and left to right. 
I’m not sure though if I’d use it for snowboarding. It seems to fog up up a little at least when you just put it on. 
I didn’t have this when it was warmer.

I've said it before I know somewhere but have to agree wholeheartedly with @chaka The skate helmets are not enough and a lot are not even certified for road use.  I use a certified harsh bike helmet with an open face when commuting or shopping trips when I'm in traffic and taking it easy as I prefer the view to be completely unobstructed.   Drivers here are special trust me so you need eyes up your arse. I use my full face shoie carbon bike lid when being a speed demon.  25 years ago I went head first into a car at 50 mph and never even had a headache.  Split my lower vertebrae though but my head was fine.  A good motorcycle or certified downhill mtb helmet is what you need for +40mph.

Wow, I really thought rurocs were at the top with tsg. I have a dh mountain bike helmet however and I am very happy with it. My only complaint is the vertical fov which means I can’t see my feet or board while looking straight ahead. Personally I just don’t really like this feeling and prefer to be able to see my feet, makes me feel more stable.


It’s a thh t-42 I’ve seen some good reviews and it’s known as one of the top budget full face helmets for DH mtb

Bump 🦆

Careful about the Shark Vancore, it is not a "true" fullface and not certified as such IIRC. But it looks damn good.

I tried two Nolan helmets today in a bike shop, Nolan N43 and N44 Evo I believe? 1.4-1.5kg approx, seems comfy.

So for you Americans, you better have health insurance if your going to fall. This is what the Hospital charged to basicly run scans on my chest and give me pain meds... They didn't even bother to check my head even though I told them that my helmet split and that I was unconscious. They gave me exactly 10 oxycodone pills and some useless muscle relaxers and sent me on my way. 

Kinda makes you not even want to get checked out even if something is wrong.

Christ almighty, that's not just the country, that hospital sucks in particular.

Last winter I had a flash knockout on a really bad fall snowboarding. Legit thought I shattered my hip falling, and smacked the back of my head good.

The first thing they did was check if I was concussed. How TF did they not check you out for that??? I was checked even in a shitty public ER.

ALSO, don't forget that if you ever get knocked unconscious you ARE by definition concussed. Watch out for falls again because you're much more likely to suffer brain damage from repetitive injuries.

I also don’t understand the prices there.
I mean I need to pay my bills for health care by my own too and yes it can be fast expensive, but 11 000 for some check up, x-ray or mri? Really? That’s just crazy too much, doesn’t matter where you live! Why your government doesn’t mind about the health of people living in the country?
Sorry for that, but I really can’t understand that.

The problem is that hospitals raise the price artificially because they know that the insurance companies will cover it.

A cat scan can cost up to 5000 dollars, and that's excluding the rest of the fees associated with your stay.

What most people don't know is that if you can't afford your hospital bill they'll actually waive most of it if you ask. Sometimes you can get up to 75% off if you actually can't pay it, and they also offer interest free payment plans over months or years.

Yeah I agree they didn't take the head injury serious and I was a little too out of it to fully understand what was going on but I did tell them about how I landed head first and woke up in the ambulance. They were more concerned about the pain in my shoulder and chest.

A mri in russia cost me about 50$ + fee for consultation. So all in all not more than 100$.
I can’t imagine that the price in the states would have a need to be higher than that.
That’s why they probably can give the 75% discount.... 
i just hope for all of us that we need as less health care as possible in our life!

I don't have a particular thread but basically I had a mechanical failure due to my negligence of adding new locktite after changing wheel set ups. 

Basically my front left motor got pulled back under full throttle causing the belts to come loose and it twisted around the idler and got caught. So I went head first into the ground going 25-30mph. My board shot out to the left and I was fully committed in a tuck.  I don't remember the fall, last thing I remember was feeling the board suddenly stopping and then groggily regaining conciousness to a bright flash light shining in my eyes inside the ambulance.

I won't let them take me F that. I was with friends and I had one drive me to the hospital so I won't have a charge there at least.

@Battosaii That's downright cheap, I got an invoice like that, then every couple weeks another one would come from some doctor that works at the fucking hospital, like somehow they charge you directly and it's not included.  And don't forget the $1200 ride to the hospital even though I took myself there but they said there was a 4 hour wait so I left, only to have to call an ambulance later.  And this was all ***after*** my insurance they wanted me to pay thousands and thousands even though they did a couple tests and didn't find anything and sent me away after like 12 hours with no results and no medicine and no answers.  And I had insurance.

I told them to go fuck themselves.  I would feel bad, but considering the circumstances, I cannot see how any reasonable person would do otherwise.

(Why yes, I do live in a country with socialized medicine _and_ enough doctors to actually make it work, how did you know?)

The problem is with head injuries, the brain is basically a large blancmange in consistency, the only thing they can do with head/brain injuries is to fix a bleed if they find one but, finding one is very difficult and fixing one is very very difficult, even in the UK they wait for complications (passing out vomiting dizziness and so on...) on head injuries as people hit their heads all the time and as said there is not much they can do anywhere in the world....  sad story time :cry:

Kinda found this out the hard way as i lost my mum because she fell and hit her head just from tripping while walking many years ago on new years eve, so do your family's and yourself a favour get the best protective helmet you can find/afford even tho it maybe not the one you like.

I’ve always liked the look of the scorpion covert/combat:

http://scorpionusa.com/products/helmets/street-helmets/covert/covert-solid.html

Only rated as an open face helmet though, chin bar is just a wind break. 

The company does some cool reinforced clothing as well.

I give my highest recommendations to the Giro Switchblade MIPS. It's been my daily driver for the last 6 months and hands down my favorite helmet I've ever owned. Suuuper comfy.

I got a Ruroc in the Black Friday sale and have been putting it through its paces snowboarding this week. I gotta say, I'm a bit disappointed. On the plus side, (1) I look like a stormtrooper. (2) It's _quality_ kit. I love the build quality, the fidlock, the safety features and all the attention to detail. It's all very confidence inspiring. Negs: (1) visibility is _really_ limited and there's no point even trying to look down. Anything more than 60° below the horizon ceases to exist. (2) I've been getting lots of fogging probs. I thought that was meant to be one of their strong points? (3) the click from fastening the face mask is  s o   f   c k  n g   l o u d , my ears ring for a few minutes afterwards. (4) it's really difficult to lift the goggles or remove the face mask while you're wearing gloves. (5) I can't hock out a loogie with the face mask on.
I realise that some of these negs are snowboard-specific but the visibility issue is the killer for me. The only feature of the Ruroc that I feel my TSG Pass is missing is that fidlock instead of the d-clip... and maybe some of that stormtrooper styling :wink:

So was anyone interested in the new Ruroc Atlas that just went live? Looks cool, and has flip up visor instead of the stupid snow googles that are impossible to use with gloves on.

goes to XXL 63-64cm for my fat face. 1,415 grams though (still light compared to other DOT certified motorcycle helmets $400(core), 430(splash of color) & $475(art design) price variants

I bought a ruroc when it was on sale for it's 10 year anniversary.  I haven't used the goggles yet because I noticed they limit your fov but without them I can see everything just fine.  They will be great for snowboarding though.  I wear my sunglasses instead.  However, with the face guard on my glasses fog up when I'm standing around which sucks.  Most of the time I don't wear the mask especially on group rides because it muffles your voice.  Being able to remove the mask is a plus.  I heard the TSG helmets fog up too when the shield is down.

The mask does come in handy for rides at dusk to block the bugs.  Also nice to have on our downtown group rides where we hop from one parking garage to another and I don't want my mug on security cameras. :slight_smile: 

You can buy a bluetooth speaker insert too which I don't believe is available with the TSG helmets.
