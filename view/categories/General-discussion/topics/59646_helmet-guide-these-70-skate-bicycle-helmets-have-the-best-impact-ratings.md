The following skate and bicycle helmets are the only models that have additional impact certifications beyond the legal minimum to be sold in the United States as bicycle helmets (the CPSC test standard).  There aren’t many: 70 helmets from 25 brands.  These are from the [Bicycle Helmet Safety Institute](https://helmets.org/)’s lists from 2018 through 2016.  _If any helmet is not listed here, including many popular helmets, to the best of my knowledge it does NOT have that certification._

**Downhill Bicycle Certified and Skate Certified - Full Face with Face Shield:**
Triple 8: Racer
Zero Gravity Skate: Vector M-5, Vector M-6

**Downhill Bicycle Certified - Full Face with Face Shield:**

**Downhill Bicycle Certified - Full Face without Face Shield:**

Top Gear Helmets R Us: Model 18, Model 38
S-One: Lifer, Kid
Nutcase: Street, Little Nutty
Punisher: Pro Series Neon
Pro-Tec: Full Cut, Classic (NOT “Classic Skate” or “Classic Full Cut Skate”)

Here’s a quick comparison chart of different test standards: [https://helmets.org/stdcompsum.pdf](https://helmets.org/stdcompsum.pdf)
Snow impact tests on curbs are not as fast as the basic CPSC standard; any helmet with the snow impact rating alone cannot legally be sold as a bicycle helmet in the US.
DOT-certified motorcycle helmets are tested at faster impacts but would likely weigh more.  The Bicycle Helmet Safety Institute argues that rating is better: [https://helmets.org/powered.htm](https://helmets.org/powered.htm)

If you have more certified helmets to include, please share!

Please consider the impact performance data when deciding which helmet to wear.

Interesting how tsg pass, one of the most hyped helmets on here, doesn't have the downhill skate cert :open_mouth:

OP hasn't really supplied enough information in his synopsis for it to be useful IMHO.

The downhill MBR F1952 exceeds all other tests for single impact velocities, including the EN1078 bicycle/skate standard. Although interestingly the F1942 Skate standard requires 2 impacts at ~1/3 less velocity.

There's no "downhill skate" certification.  I'm referring to two separate test methods: ASTM F1952 Downhill Mountain Bicycle, and ASTM F1492 Skate.  Sorry for the confusion.

TSG Pass is EN 1078 and ASTM  F1952 certified

EN 1078 is european certification and ASTM is MTB certification
