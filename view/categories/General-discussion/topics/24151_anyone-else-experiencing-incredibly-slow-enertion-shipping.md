I ordered a space cell pro enclosure from enertion a month ago, and they still haven't shipped it. I emailed support and they said that they would talk to the warehouse but that was two weeks ago and it still hasn't been shipped. Has anyone else experienced this from enertion? I'm going to be moving in about three weeks and I was really hoping to have this build done by then.

Yes, this is very common with Enertion but also eSk8 in general. 

There are numerous threads about this and I have a funny feeling this one is going to get locked soon.

@JLabs 
Some vendors are pretty fast at delivering parts.
Torqueboards
Psychotiller
JLabs Esk8 market
APS
Chaka
I personally have had very good success with these vendors.

I'm changing website and domains. 

The electric-skateboard.market domain ends in 15 days and after that she will die in the graveyard of lonely domains.

Yeah I ordered a vescx and a controller and they took forever as well. They took so long that I decided to email them and to just ask for a refund. Kind of funny because when I asked for the refund my stuff was shipped the very next day... coincidence? Maybe...

Maybe I'll have to try that, I just hope they don't actually give me a refund because I don't really know anywhere else to get a good enclosure like that.

So that everyone knows. Enertion is based out of Australia. This is about two to three weeks for shipping from Australia to USA.

I can't talk for the Australia -> USA shipping time. But I've ordered from USA before and it has only taken a few days to show up. I guess it all comes down to who is used and the luck of the draw :slight_smile:

I would understand if it took two weeks or so to arrive after shipping but it's been a month and they still haven't even shipped what I ordered...

Good idea, I think I'll just cancel my enertion order and get the psychotiller 405 enclosure.
