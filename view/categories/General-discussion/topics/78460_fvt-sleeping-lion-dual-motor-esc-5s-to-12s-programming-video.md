Hello fellow skateboard builders.  I've recently tried to use FVT Sleeping Lion Dual Motor ESC 120a 5s to 12s.  This ESC should have been called Angry Lion, because out of the box, it will try to hurt you.  It has lots of torque and breaking is a little harsh.  Those issues can be remedied by programming this ESC.  Never having to program an ESC before, it has been an adventure.  I've put this video together to help others and expedite the learning process.
