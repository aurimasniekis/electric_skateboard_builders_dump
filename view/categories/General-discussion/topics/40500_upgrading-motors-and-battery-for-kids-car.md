I'd like to add a couple of focboxes and a 10s3p battery to this jeep with a really big wheel pulley to reach max 10mph but with a lot of torque to be able to ride on the beach sand and take him with me to the woods. 

Has anyone upgraded their kids toy successfully?

My grandson had one of those a while back. 
I've seen on YouTube where someone put a second stock battery in series with the existing battery to boost the voltage and said it made a big difference

Yeah most of these ride on toys have extra space in the battery compartment for an extra battery.

I don't see why it wouldn't work. What motor would you use? Maybe an 80100 outrunner

@pat.speed PFFFF, a 5065 would already be like 5x the power of the stock motor.

At least give him enough power to be able to do donuts!!

With a 6355 170KV on 10S 13T motor pulley I'll need a 240T HTD5 pulley.

I'm not sure if that pulley would be available somewhere.

Maybe a chain sproket would be better

Yeah when I think about it a 80100 might be just a little overkill, but hey you can never have too much torque

3S 8Ah zippy lipo with a bms and two amp charger. Replaced some wires and added a fuel guage to the dash. 

next thing is to get some modor mounts and belt drives onto those wheels, then grip the wheels with some kind of rubber coating or sleeve. 

its still got the stock motor but its enough to take me down the street with him on the hood.

You know you can skip all this and go straight to a go-kart using aluminum extrusion if you got the money.

I've done a few upgrades to my son's 12v Mini Cooper, and he loves it. 

https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B00BJ2ZEBI/ref=cm_cr_arp_mb_bdcrb_top?ie=UTF8

When the shitty lead acid battery just stopped taking a charge one day, I threw in a 6s battery and top speed jumped from 5mph to 9-10mph. It was like an instant turbo upgrade and his mind was blown! Even with me barely fitting my 180lb. ass in it with one leg hanging out, it was able to do wheelies. Very torquey. However, the next time I took him out to drive it, I rushed to put two 6s batteries in to give him more range and accidentally wired them up in series, out of habit. Didn't realize what I'd done until he took off like a rocket on meth, made it about 40 feet, then POP, POP, sparks from each wheel and...no more go time. Oops. Apparently 12s was too much. Time for new motors. I went and did some reading at http://forum.modifiedpowerwheels.com/ and found these little guys on eBay

https://www.ebay.com/itm/142529321629

These motors are a little hotter than the stock ones, so now I'm running them on 4s and my son is so happy. Still goes about 10mph, which is plenty....for now. Only problem is that the throttle is not variable, so it's either on or off when you push the gas pedal, but it does have two speeds, so I'm teaching him how to take off in "1st" gear and shift to "2nd" gear after he gets going. Get him used to the basics of driving a stick. 

I'd definitely be interested in upgrading to a couple FOCBOX's, but I'm a little unclear on how to run them with DC motors and whether a regular 3 wire foot pedal throttle would work with them. I feel like trying to mate brushless motors to the gearboxes would be more trouble than it's worth, since the upgraded DC motors have plenty of torque and speed and are basically plug and play. At this point, I just want to improve the throttle response and handling a bit.

You can upgrade to metal gears as well to handle extra torque

if you're going that far into it I would get some new wheels and tires. those plastic ones are dangerous and they only have a rubber band for traction....

You could try inrunners, they should be closer to the DC motor in form factor. That would allow you to keep using the stock gearbox.

Either that or 3d print some big wheel pulleys.

You can 3D print it in parts and join with glue ou zip ties

My little brother has an old pocket bike that we're going to try to convert to electric...do you guys know of any wired throttle set ups for bikes?

i bet the endless sphere guys would know. My first instinct would be to use an ebay ebike electronics kit and drop your own battery in

I'm hoping to convert a child's ride-on 6v car to 12v.

The car is manufactered in Italy by Toys Toys. They are licensed to make replicas of road going manufaturers vehicles for children.

They do 6V and 12V versions of many of their cars.

The one I have happens to be a 6V version and as such its a bit sluggish and can only operate on flat concrete surfaces - it doesn't have the torque to cope with grass or anything other than a very very shallow incline.

While looking on a stockists website I noticed that spares are available for these cars - including replacement 6V and 12V motors, batteries and their corresponding wiring looms.

They don't specifically list an 'upgrade' kit and when I contacted them direct they weren't very helpful and didn't endorse the upgrade (as I suspected would be their response).

[The 12V versions](https://toyboxadvisor.com/best-12-volt-ride-on-cars#2_Moderno_Kids_Kiddie_Roadster_Children_Ride-On_Car) have 2 6V batteries and are advertised as being able to ride over grass so I'm keen to swap my 6V components for the more powerful versions.

A long time ago, in the days of SLA batteries, I did this to a similar car ðŸ˜‚

Maybe I can`t to say you about upgreating battery, but I have some information of intereting vary of Kids ride-on cars with reliable and capacious battery. There are [TOP 5 ride-on cars for Kids](http://www.newkidscar.com/new-kids-car/top-five-new-best-kids-white-colour-ride-on-cars-ice-white-mercedes-s63-lamborghini-aventador-big-rangie-ride-on-jeep-licensed-white-12v-range-rover-evoque-12v-2-seat-licensed-mini-cooper-beachco/)

Eboosted, I have this exact Jeep that you posted for my son. I really do not know much about electrical work. I am wanting to boost this vehicle speed though, I have an extra 12v battery. I am just curious if you have any tutorials on upgrading this exact vehicle, or any tips on where to get started for learning what I need to know. I want to make this vehicle more fun for my child, without making it blow up Lol.

Well, I purchased a Telsa for my son 3 months ago and he seems to be pretty happy with the current performance, maybe I'll make the speed/torque upgrade down the road when he is 3 years old, currently 1 year and 11 months, so unfortunately no tips for you at the moment.

Here is the video when he got his Telsa :heart_eyes::heart_eyes::heart_eyes:
