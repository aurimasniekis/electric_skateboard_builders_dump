Hey guys. Just wanted to give you a heads up that we'll be doing an A2ESK8 electric skateboard/film screening event on February 4th in Ann Arbor, MI. We are partnering with Neutral Zone, a local non profit teen center where the event will be held. The film screening portion is in conjunction with a 24 hour Neutral Zone Film competition so most of the audience will be comprised of young, aspiring makers and filmmakers.

We'll have an introductory workshop on DIY builds, an electric gokart tournament, live music + DJ and a film fest with a special screening of "Session Error" with Q&A panel. Swing by if you're around the area, it's a FREE event and open to the community. Hope to see you there :slight_smile:

Thanks dude. Yeah it should be fun, almost everyone is volunteering their own time and resources so it really is just an extension of the DIY community. I'll shoot some recap video to share with you guys.
