I have now spent some time on the gokart track. I am beginning to get the hang of it, and are slowly beginning to learn what it takes to be fast around a track. But as always I have more questions than answers. So let me tap in to your experience and knowledge. What would be the better set up and riding style for tight track racing. 

Set up: 
My set up right now are: 26cm/10,2inch wide board with a wheel base of 86cm/33,8inch. Wheels (6inch pneumatics) sits 32cm/12,5inch apart (wheel center to wheel center). RKP trucks 50degrees front and 25degrees rear. 

What would, in general, be the better track set up. Loose/tight trucks. Lesser/bigger wheelbase. Narrower/wider deck. RKP/TKP. 

Riding style:
I find myself having the rear foot in the same spot all the time and then constantly moving the front foot form side to side (want some of the foot over the edge) in order to get enough leverage to make tight turns with speed. When doing frontside turns I squat down, grab the board and lean. Backside turns are still done standing up leaning. 

So I am wondering in which direction I should look to optimize. Both in regards of set up and riding style. 

Some o my thoughts are‚Ä¶ is it better to have looser and more turnable trucks to be able to turn tighter without leaning that much or would it be better to be able to really lean in corners and then have more speed through corners. 
Maybe a deck that is not that wide in order to have the front foot in the same position all the time so I don‚Äôt have to move around. Maybe a deck that is very narrow in the front and wide in the back. 

Would it be better to do the turns with less speed but tighter or with more speed but a bigger turn. I feel the latter myself as I like to really lean into the turn, and I feel its faster, but I really don‚Äôt now for real. 

Let‚Äôs have the discussion about the above. Anyone have real experience and knowledge about the above? Not just something you feel. Would appreciate it!

If you want a deck narrow at the front and wide at the back talk to the guys selling the metasurf DD. They had a deck like that

If you want something nimble, go for as narrow trucks as you can (it maximises grip)

Pneumatics don‚Äôt have a lot of grip versus a proper set of urethane wheels. They also put your center of gravity very high up, making the board feel skittish as you enter a fast turn. You want a planted ride feel that gives you confidence, not that.

Your best course of action is to find ways to drop the board‚Äôs ride height if possible. Trading off pneumatic tires for regular wheels with wide contact patches will afford you a lot more traction... however that‚Äôs only possible if you‚Äôre willing to spend that cash/effort.


Loose trucks saves lives. It‚Äôs better to have them loose than overly tight in racing situations. Since you said you have to constantly shift your foot to make tight turns, you need to loosen up those trucks. You want bushings with moderate rebound. Too much rebound and the board will want to straighten out on you in a turn. That‚Äôs obviously bad. 


RKPs are going to do better than TKPs from a stability perspective. An RKP with rake is going to make leaning into fast turns a tad easier due to their dive. Your trucks should be as narrow as possible so that you have more leverage over the wheels. This gives more grip and better turning responsiveness. If it feels like your trucks don‚Äôt want to turn quickly to rapid weight shifting, they‚Äôre probably too wide.

That deck will ride like trash. The narrow front means you have no leverage to put weight over the wheels and turn the trucks. Avoid.

Let me jump in here, since i was invited. In my opinion, you are way off. Pneumatic, rubber tires will have more grip than urethane. Especially on the kart tracks we have raced on.  I have tried both on the same track and the urethane brakes loos easily at the cornering speeds we reach. Also, TKP's worked way better on the track for tight precise turns. Again, I have ridden both TKP's and RKP's on the same track. I believe you are correct regarding the narrower trucks, though. You would definitely be able to turn quicker but you would loose a bunch of stability in the straightaways. I think part of what @psychotiller is doing is trying to curb false advice.

Depends on how much weight is being distributed across 4 tires. The contact patch is also affected by how much the tires are inflated. A high CG can provide more leverage for a wheel to 'bite' into the ground, but at the same time it moves all the weight to the outer wheels instead of distributing the force across all 4 wheels/contact patches.

Deck: 33" wheelbase. For me a longer wheelbase makes a wider stance possible.    It increases stance stability and allows leg leverage to be gained quicker over accel and decel saving transition time.  Inherently a longer wb will increase stability. Short Track racing with my height 5'5" i have found I like no less than 40" wb on an open wheel deck with a low gravity center with 30+" of foot spread. @treenutter makes a 44"x11" deck that I think hits these points nicely.
For Short Track Racing, in the finals of World Cup, no one fast was grabbing a rail or moving their front foot.  16 turns in 32 seconds there is just no time for it.  Board setup is crutial. Finding the softest duro bushings  you can manage on the front  and 10 duro heavier on the rear is a good place to start. You should be able to easily leverage your turn without touching your board or shifting your feet. I like rear stear taken out of the rear 50/40 split. It helps the rear wheels track inside the front and feels more stable when powering out of turns on soft duro bushings.  
For the 52 riders at world cup not one set of urethane wheels made it through the semifinals. Every Short track race I have attended Urethane has been at a disadvantage to pnumatic rubber in the corner grip department.

Not sure what speeds we will be making. Track is rough and should keep the speeds I suspect under 40mph. Will be a good time and everyone who runs the gauntlet will learn something from it.  A great venue to test on a closed road. There is always the DH part. I plan on E-Boarding that as well. Would be great if you guys were there.üèÅüèÅ

theyre doing 44 average on the way down and it didn't look like any of the wheels were bigger than the 83 centrax.  actually it looked like almost everyone in the videos I saw was riding them.  surely with power and maybe a more cushy wheel someone bold could break their downhill record going up.  if that happens it wil be a statement.  so far with your trucks and you past you seem the best contender

go kart track without the barriers would be even better, just cones or something.   I keep imagining id go over a barrier on a go kart track and hit something vs just sliding out.  be nice if we could go balls to the...lack of walls.  no need for closed roads or a special venue and just a parking lot would do to be able to make something as good as anything.

These are my experience and thoughts till now‚Ä¶. 

I don‚Äôt find it optimal having to move the front foot around. But right now I have to in order to get enough leverage to cut the corners with speed. This is the first thing I will see if I can change. I will work with the truck clamping (having krank formular) especially in the front and maybe work with bushings. (@Alphamail do you think it makes sense to change the formular in order to change rebound and stuff?) And I will change the rear wedging from 25 to 35 to see how that effects things. 

Grabbing: I follow the grabbing thing - something I have been thinking about. As it is now I feel I can keep a higher corner speed with grabbing and really leaning in to it. I can keep throttle almost all the way around a 90 degrees corner. Something I can‚Äôt do  now standing. Will be interesting to see how that feeling change when I do the above. 

TKP: @mccloed, now I have to try the tkp thing. Something tells me it‚Äôs gonna work better. And with your experience‚Ä¶ Did you run tkp with pneumatics? Speed are not high and in that light I thing tkp would work good. Guess I have to try myself.

I feel that the crucial part I need to control better are breaking right before a corner. It‚Äôs here it gets sketchy most often. I find that wide trucks and pneumatics helps. 

Wheels: I have tried both pneumatics and pu wheels. Not on the same setup so not completely comparable. I have tried the reflex formular from abec - they slid on me. No name pu - they slid on me. 80a kegel was really sticky and felt secure. But I do like the squeezy pneumatics better. But I have almost only been riding pneumatics the last year and are properly biased toward them.  They have begun to whine now in corners but I have yet to experience them slipping. 
The track I am on they have this special asphalt formular that are specific for racing. Maybe that have something to say in which type of wheel are best. 
BTW‚Ä¶ I do have a set of the eagerly awaiting race wheels heading my way shortly. 

Am I totally off when I think that tight track racing really aren‚Äôt comparable with much other skateboarding. We need to find what works best here - right?

Lol bro... First thing you will notice after swapping from pnuemies to urethane on the same turn you were doing with pnuemies you will be lying on your ass with urethane ;) Talk about grip after you ride enough miles to talk. Because so far everything is based on your "magical" experience :)

I have zero esk8 racing experience. But have spendt a few years racing gocarts when I was younger. There are clearly some general tips that can be take from gocart/cars/motorbikes and be used for esk8 track racing. If urethane had more grip than "pnuemies" why dont we see that used on racing cars? I would look for softer compounds or maybe use chemicals thats used on gocart tires to soften up the material. I assume you already run lower pressure to increase the contact surface + heat up the tire?

The more comfortable you are - the faster you go. I would focus on 1 thing at the time. Having to move the foot around doesnt sound ideal. As others suggested, looser trucks seems the way to go. After that I would focus on apex and out of the corners stability/grip.

Lower centre of gravity is prefered as long you dont bottom out or the tires bounce on the surface.

Think you are right. I can feel the uncertainty in not knowing exactly how much I can push it in corners without slipping. Feel that I need to work on knowing exactly how much.

There is an interesting revolution where people converts race cars and bikes to compete against ice engines and is really competitive even with diy builds. Interesting times indeed :D

Think you are right. I can feel the uncertainty in not knowing exactly how much I can push it in corners without slipping. Feel that I need to work on knowing exactly how much.

Come join us next time

I have my trampa torn apart for winter upgrades. I will join once all my parts show up. Lets hope enertion can deliver that unity on time? We run very different setups. So it will be fun to compare how they perform on a track. For the same reason bindings gives more confidence running offroad. I think it could be an improvement on the track as well.

I think your right, bindings would give back leverage to a short wheelbase board under hard accel/decel and turn. Short WB reacts quicker to Input and could be the hot ticket when used with bindings for ST racing. I gotta try this.

I think you hypothesis that bindings will make shorter boards more comfortable to ride is correct. Shorter boards turns better. The question is what is the sweet spot for indoor gocart tracks? 

What about the truck width? I recently swapped to the wide trucks on my trampa because they feel more predicable running offroad. But I think it also applies to track racing since you want to be right at the grip limit.

I want to play with that. One day (soon) I will rearrange my spacers and put the wheel closer, and see what happens. Can only do in the front though. ![IMG_8263|666x500](upload://fBFLIusO63Hj6EQ9cdF4rJxm16S.jpeg)

The speed on the short course, kart track is not that fast, typically. So, TKP's can get you around the corners a little quicker than RKP's on the same set-up, I've experienced.  I do run the TKP's with the pneumatics. I also find that the TKP's work better for off-road riding, also. When we get to race off-road I feel this same set-up will work well.

All opinions (which are valid) put aside, for me the thing is very clear; there is only one question to ask: who is right now at the leading edge in the newly born esk8 track racing scene? the answer, with no introduction.... @MoeStooge !

He is at the tip of the spear. Some ask, pneumies or urethane? ...well, the answer to that is also very clear: none. Because the correct answer is the third option: rubber!

Then there are a few other things to consider...

> @MoeStooge 
> 
> Deck: 33" wheelbase. For me a _longer wheelbase makes a wider stance possible. It increases stance stability and allows leg leverage to be gained quicker over accel and decel saving transition time._ Inherently a longer wb will increase stability.

> Short Track racing with my height 5‚Äô5" i have found I like _no less than 40" wb on an open wheel deck with a low gravity center with 30+" of foot spread._ @treenutter makes a 44"x11" deck that I think hits these points nicely.

> For Short Track Racing, in the finals of World Cup, _no one fast was grabbing a rail or moving their front foot._ 16 turns in 32 seconds there is just no time for it.

> Board setup is crutial. _Finding the softest duro bushings you can manage on the front and 10 duro heavier on the rear is a good place to start._ You should be able to easily leverage your turn without touching your board or shifting your feet.

> _I like rear stear taken out if the rear 50/40. It helps the rear wheels track inside the front and feels more stable when powering out of turns on soft duro bushings._

> For the 52 riders at world cup _not one set of urethane wheels made it through the semifinals._ Every Short track race I have attended Urethane has been at a disadvantage to pnumatic rubber in the corner grip department.

Spent another hour on the track today. Messing with some of the things mentioned here. 

1. Looser front truck. Did loosen it to the max. It did ok. but I think I have something to gain by trying out other bushing types and durometers. To be continued. 

2. Narrower fronttruck. I narrowed it by 2cm altogether. Didn‚Äôt get enough time on it to really know if it made a difference. First I didn‚Äôt like it. Didn‚Äôt feel I got much narrower turning out of it. But after 10 min. it felt better and I did get my fastes lap with that set up. 

3. Grabbing. There is no doubt. I go way faster when grabbing. Can really lean in to the corners and have throttle way longer and more than with not grabbing. Acceleration starts way before going out of the corner. There is no contest. To the point that I don‚Äôt think that will change with another setup. But will be interesting to see when I try other setups.  Maybe it makes sense not grabbing when in a race situation with others on the track and you have to maneuver around others. But only me on the track finding the perfect line. No contest! 

Still had to move the front foot around a little, but less. 

Slowly cutting time. Did my fastest lap today 40.50 sec. One sec. better than last week.

I had a front drive and rear drive raceboard at the world cup. Both boards broke the track record at different times and made the final 6.  Front drive set fast time for the event weekend with @evoheyax on it.  The WR board is front drive and went 63mph (101kph) with Max Capps.  The front drive does break traction under hard accel. Being  you have track access it might be fun to set-up your board for FD.

Had the weekly hour on the track today. Didn‚Äôt get to work on the setup today because what I wanted to try didn‚Äôt work out. Wanted to remove my wedges from the rear but the king is too long. This kingpin came with the 50 degree baseplate and I have changed that to a 35 degree. I have to either cut the kingpin or get another. But I can‚Äôt see that they have different kingpins for different baseplates.

So it became a session where I focused on riding style. I played with this:


* Trying to not let go of the throttle completely at any time. Meaning that I constantly had a little throttle all the time. This made a smoother ride. The acceleration and de-acceleration got less abruptly which I felt made me more in control. This opens up for me to play with the line. Would it be better to take bigger turns in order to have more throttle all the time. I think so, but I need to test it more. 
* I fund that I have a tendency to stand straight with my rear leg. I fund that if I bend that and came lower it gave me the feeling that I could go faster with more control and bigger lean. in soft corners. This hamonize good with my experience that then I go really low and grab in the tight corners I go faster. 

I still have to move the front foot around and I would like to see if I could find a setup where that wouldn‚Äôt be necessary. So I think I need at setup that turns better with less rebound. 

Right now I have rkp surf rodz 50 degrees front and 25 rear. I want to change the 25 to 35 as described above. Bushings: I run krank 87a barrel/barrel (no washers) front and krank 90a flat washer/Fatcone/barrel. I was thinking that I will try to change to WFB compound both board and road side. Going for 88a barrel/barrel front and 88a fatcone/barrel back and then play with different washers. @Alphamail do you have any input? Sound like a way to go or do you have any other suggestions? Lower duro? I weigh 165 lbs.

1. I want to see if I can eliminate the need to move my front foot around. Right now I have to place it on the edge to get enough leverage to do the tighter turns. I would like to be able to not have to move the front foot. 
2. Sometimes when I lean in to a corner I don‚Äôt get the amount of turn that my body think I am getting and I sort of loose balance. So tighter turning. 
3. I have the feeling that when i wiggle the board from side to side the bushings gets tighter and tighter. I would like to have more or less the same tightness in the whole wiggle.

Hey David, bushing shape has a profound effect on response as does compound.  With Krank, you can keep it you can keep it loose in the center, dive in hard and still be supported.  Cones up front as @Irdesigns suggested or a Cone / Barrel may work very well using KranK in the same durometer as your barrels.  You may need to compensate in the rear with a Barrel / FatCone combination in 87a also.  I would start with just picking up a pair of KranK 87a Cones, Introduce one into the mix up front to see if you are headed the right direction.  Tight track racings requires a nimble setup so also try replacing the rear roadside Barrel with one of the 87a Cones also.  Remember the starting point for KranK is just snug enough to take out all the slop in the stack

When I flip the board around and just wiggle the truck by hand I get the feeling that it is the board side bushing that needs to be different. Its there the restriction seems to be. So either softer euro or con other shape. Lets start with shape.

Yes and it defines the seat better than stock which has more radius than it needs plus it completely ditches the venturi shape seat and allows you to use larger bushings both boardside and roadside

For todays session I made one change. Changed the rear truck angle from 25 to 35. That made a huge difference. Turning radius got a lot smaller and it took me a huge step in the direction I wanted. It felt like I could take the sharp corners with higher speed. I could could better ‚Äúrescue‚Äù and imperfect line. It also made the board more twitchy which is ok and I could handle it - just a thing to consider. 

I still need a little more turning from the front truck. When hitting the tight corners with high speed or having imperfect foot positioning I really need more turning from the front.  So the 87a krank cone bushings will be next weeks tweak. I did have them with me, but did not put them on today. Don‚Äôt feel I need more turning from the back.

It is pretty hard this track racing. I think I have 5 and max 10 really fast laps in me in an hour like this. 

Also I have not found how much I can push my tires before they slip. I push them pretty hard and they have not slipped yet. But I really fear it. As I have no change correcting it if it happens. Going 22 mph in a soft curve that makes the wheels whine loud is scary :) 

I cut time with 4/10 of a second - 38.93 to 38.53.

The plan for this weeks session on the track was to put in some cone bushings in the front. I installed them yesterday, but it just did not feel right when I was just standing wiggling the board. So I decided to put back in the barrel / barrel combination and play with wedging the front truck instead. I used a 5 degree wedge to increase the angle from 50 to 55. 

I realized that this also affected the ride height significantly and in a different way than when dewedging the rear. Making it higher. I thought it was irritating when I saw this, but it might have ended up positively as it gave more leverage over the bushings in a good way. I did not compensate with a riser in the back so this have also effected the rear truck angle.  

Unfortunately I spend a significantly amount of the track time trying to fix a scary noise from the wheels/trucks/board - heck I don‚Äôt know where from - when turning with speed.  I went through everything and could not find the source. But it was one of those noises that did not feel right, and I was scary to just let it be. But all of a sudden it disappeared and I had good 20 min. left. 

The extra 5 degrees in the front took me almost to where I want to be. Turning radius decreased and it helped especially in the backside turning where I am not grabbing. 

It‚Äôs now easier now to compensate from an imperfect line and I don‚Äôt need to move my front foot around anymore (ahhh yes - very little). I feel I am very close to where I want to be with the set up for now.

 I might want slightly more turning from the front, and might throw in one or 2 extra degrees, or put in a little extra height to get more leverage over the bushings. Or I will just let it be for now, and take up the tuning when I get some new stuff to try out I have ordered

As I started to get the feel of this weeks setup I fund my self wanting a wider stance. Luckily I have I longer deck in the pipeline to try. When I have fund if a longer deck is the way to go, and gathered more track experience we will make the perfect track racing deck @treenutter

One thing that still holds me back are not knowing when the wheels slip. I am too chicken to just let go. But today I learnt that I might have had to little air in my wheels. I upped the pressure a little, and that felt better. I gain a little extra trust in the wheels each time and I think that this will be a path to cut more time. 

I did cut time again going from 38,53 last week to 37,67 today. 

Next weeks tweak will be @MoeStooge racing wheels. Dont hope I have to start all over again with tweaking. 

Todays tweak.

This week I got new wheels to try out. Stooge race wheels - 120mm x 63mm 50a/45a. Supposedly made specific for racing, and I bought them specifically for my track racing. They were an easy mount and ready to race without any struggle.

They were quite a different experience than the six-shooters and it took me a good 45 minuts to be comfortable enough to start give full effort.

**Coasting:** This was perhaps the biggest difference. They coast more than the shooters and that makes approaching corners different. With the shooters I didn‚Äôt need the brakes at all. I could time letting go of the throttle with the corners, and I didn‚Äôt need to let go of the throttle early. With the race wheels letting go off the throttle and use coasting as brakes had to be done long before the corner. It didn‚Äôt really make sense to coast that long.

**Grib:** Grib was one of the things I had high expectations about. When mounting the wheels they attracted a lot of dust and stuff and they felt sticky to the touch. When I rolled the first meters the first thing I noticed was the sound they made. It sounded sort of slimy and sticky to the ground - a good sound.

They felt very secure and for the first time I had a couple of corners where I threw everything in to the corner with out worrying that the wheels would slip. This is great and I can‚Äôt wait to work more with that. Now my backside cornering are just as I like it to be. The front side (where I grab) changed a little with these wheels, and I need to get comfortable throwing everything in to that corner side again.

**Gearing:** It was geared 16/60. I need to change to 42 in the wheel. With 60 I reached top speed on the straight stretch and I felt I could handle significantly more speed there. So I need higher top speed. Will see if I can get it by changing wheel gear.

**Sensitivity:** One of the things that I love the most about pneumatics are the way the suck up all unevenness. The race wheel are more sensitive, and even though this is a pretty smooth race track there are some unevenness where the asphalt are connected.

Especially there are one tight corner where there are a small bump. This corner require a full lean forcing a very tight turn. Two times the bump started a slight slip which was not a good feeling hanging there. I need to find out what to do in that particular corner because after the slip I did not give everything in that corner.

**Peeling:** When looking at the wheels of the gokarts I see that the rubber is peeling off the tire, and there are small rubber peels everywhere. These race wheels also peels. Take a look at the picture to see how the wheel looked after the session. Cant figure out how much is the wheels own peel, and how much these sticky wheels have sucked up peel and shit from the track. It will be interesting to see how long they will last.

Overall these wheels definitely are race wheels and they thrive on the track. Can‚Äôt wait to get more time on the track with these. I did cut time again. From 37,67 last week to 37,49 this week. This lap was my last lap of the day, with a drained battery and a ‚Äúslow‚Äù gearing. The race wheels gave me better cornering and I look forward to see what I can get with the 42 gearing and higher top speed on the straight stretch.

To be continued‚Ä¶.

What you see is dead rubber picked up from the track. When you start out on a cold tire make sure not to hard charge the first two turns.  It allows time for the dead rubber to clear off and the grip to maximize as heat is built.    I'm still on my origional set.

Yeah I thought so. Couldn't believe if the wheels where shredding that much rubber. Do you know what kind of temperature the wheels are getting and if that equals the temp the rubber is the most sticky? I have the feeling that the wheel could benefit from getting a little warmer.

mmm‚Ä¶. first session without a new best lap. 

I made some small changes from last week. 2 degree more in the front truck. Wheel pulley from 60t to 42t. And the back truck got a little riser so the deck was level. 

So todays set up looked like this: Front truck 57 degrees. Rear 35 degrees. Gearing 16/42. Motor max 70. Battery max 25. Stooge race wheels. 

It actually felt pretty good. The turning was good both frontside and backside. I did not reach max speed as last time, so this wasn‚Äôt a limit. The acceleration was a little slower but it didn‚Äôt feel slow compared to last week where I got the fastes lap in my last lap with a drained battery. 

I am a little puzzled why I did not cut time today. Last week it felt like I had a lot more in me if only the top speed had been higher. 

Either I just wasn‚Äôt fast today or this setup just is a bit slower than the setup from last week, or I am slowly reaching the limit where I am close to how fast I can be on this track. 

I think I will keep this setup next week and maybe change the VESC a little for more acceleration and see what happens. If I am still not fast there I will change back and see if the fastness returns. 

The wheels still feels good on the track and I can lean good in corners. Feels secure.

Maybe lower the teeth on the motor pulley  The speed should have gone up cause the motors are able to spin the wheels quicker with the smaller gears.  But could have been something small like you were not as aerodynamic as last time

I have thought of playing with the motor pulley as well. The speed did go up today  and I didn't reach the max the setup could deliver. So the max speed wasn't the limit today. 

I think the limit was myself today. It is really demanding doing these fast laps. I have to really concentrate. I sweat like a pig, my heart is pumping and I loose my breath. I might not have been totally up to that today. You know Christmas hangover :)

Back in 88 I started building and racing dirt oval Stock Cars. An old timer was watching me hotlap and overdrive the turn entry.  He advised me I was carrying too much entry speed and was causing the car to spend to much time in the center and that it was slowing my exit speed. It was the first time I heard the term, "back up your entry."  Pinching the entry or turning in early has much of the same effect as over driving entry speeds. Fast turns are about using the correct entry Arc and speed that maintains momentum through the apex. From my personal experience when it all comes together the corner speed feels slower and with less input effort.  
    Gearing: acceleration from the center off is very very important.  If it was me, I would put the 60t back on and bump the pinion to a 17t. On 10s 190kv it would put you at 37-38kph vs the 16/42 which is closer to 50kph and limiting drive..
 A 12/42 would yeild the same results as a 17/60 for final drive. üèÅüèÅ

They actually talk about what Moe is talking about on older seasons of Top Gear.  A slow in to the turn to clip the apex and fast out of the turn.

Think you are right. I did go fast in to turns today. The staff talks about sacrificing (lower speed than you think is necessary) corner 1 and 7 in order to have throttle longer in the stretch after those corners. 

What do you mean about the "center"? ("causing the car to spend to much time in the center"...."acceleration from the center off"...) is it in the apex of the turn? 

I will play with the motor pulley. I think if I can get something between 16/42 and 16/60 it would work pretty good. 

And I will start working more on how to do the turns. They have this map:

Edit: when I look at it I have been starting the cornering too early. Will see how it feels to go later in to the turn to be able to throttle sooner out the corner. But to be able to do that I might need to be able to turn sharper than now. We will see. 

![Line-Map|690x388](upload://aGnV27QzyeYyUGW0KDud2sFlLFL.jpeg) 

Green: Throttle.
Red: Brake.
Yellow: Coasting.  

Turn 1: Pull to the right, brake late and hard. Cut the turn in a late apex, for a wide entrance to the turn.

Turn 4: Do turn 3 so you get all the way to the right for turn 4. Brake late and shortly and start the turn. Throttle again at apex. 

Turn 5: Keep all the way to the left. Let go of the throttle or brake shortly. Throttle again at apex. 

Turn 7: Start the turn late. Brake shortly after you reach the first apex. Turn without sliding. Keep a constant steering angle round the corners before the straight stretch.

[/quote]

There are 3parts to any turn. Entry ,Apex and exit. Entry is used to setup the Apex (turn center). You should have turn speed and race line established on entry for the appex and exit. The Apex should be rolled through without drive or brake forces being applied. It allows lateral forces to be applied at maximum efficientcy without drive or brake Dynamics subtracting from lateral grip.  When carrying too much speed or pinching the entry you lose kph throu the apex while trying to maintain the perfered race line.  .1 second here .2 second there it adds up quickly.  Setting up the entry is the key to making fast corners.

I kept the setup from last week. I now want to focus more on how I ride the track than the setup. I have begun to watch and read the tutorial I link to above. And I want to slowly work on some of the many suggestions they give. I had 3 main focus points in this weeks session:

1. Entering the turns a little later than before and trying to do a later apex (this taken from the first tutorial).
2. Trying to find the optimal speed entering the turns. In my case meaning I have to enter them a little slower, as Moe suggested after last week. 
3. Looking at the apex before I enter the turn. This is taken from the tutorial 3 ‚ÄúIMPROVING VISION ON TRACK‚Äù

And then at the end of the session I added a fourth focus and began to work on braking before the slowest turn on the track. 

I find it every every difficult to get the same speed and starting turning point each time. And this affect hitting the late apex a lot. Sometimes its spot on, and next time I go through the same part of the track its way off. This track racing is difficult but I guess it‚Äôs a matter of practice. The good thing is that I really feel when its spot on. It feels so good! I didn‚Äôt have that many good laps today. I still have a tendency to approach the turns with to much speed, but I did cut time and had a couple of laps that was better than the previous best lap. 

Being aware of the where i look really felt good. I got better prepare for the turns and it just felt really good to be looking ahead. 

I started to work on breaking before turns. Up till now I have just been coasting. I have not felt that I was ready to work on breaking yet. To much to control and to much going on. And I am very sensitive when the board jerks with hard acceleration and when letting go of the throttle quickly or braking hard. This throws me off. But it seems that I am ready to work on that. 

Gearing: As Moe suggested last week I think I will work on the gearing. This 16/42 is to slow accelerating out of the turns. Especially when the battery drains. Will go back to 60 on the wheel and see if I can find a 17 and 18 motor pulley to play with. I am just really bad in fining stuff. Does anyone know where to get them. Have to fit the Maytech motors with 8mm bore and key. 

Best lap today was 37.19. Nad after I began to time my laps it have been looking like this:

41.50 sec
40.50 sec.
38.93 sec.
38.53 sec.
37.67 sec.
37.49 sec.
38.78 sec.
37.19 sec.

Yeah‚Ä¶ I feel really lucky. There are a couple of kart tracks near me. This one has electric karts, so I thought that they might be more prone to letting electric skateboards in. I went there in person and talked to them. They were very friendly. They had to think a little about price. It is a business and even though they would love to help, they also wanted to earn a little. They let me in just before opening hour where I can have an hour for my self. If I wanted to come in their opening hour I would have to pay what the can sell an hour of track racing for. 

Its a really nice place and they are pretty proud of it. They have real race asfalt laid and because its electric karts there are no spill or anything on the track. 

I think its the perfect solution. I come and do my thing. They dont have to be involved at all, and they have people there anyway, so they get a little extra income.

‚Äúback up your entry.‚Äù eh, @MoeStooge? Esk8 racing is transforming really fast (and technical)!

On the other hand, you guys haven't think about changing the race track format? You ever consider doing race tracks with larger format, less curves and longer straights? Less Karty, sort of speak? Personally I think those mouse maze-lilliput cornering-convoluted track layouts are so annoying. These boards are so powerful but become limited by the short straights and multitude of curves that there is no chance to see their true potential. Now I understand why in the US people like ovals intead broken auto racing circuits. Oval straights are where true race vehicles show their top performance. These layouts are like those from Kart competition, so short and curvy, that from horizontal stand point all racers appear to overlap each other you don't really know who is at front and who is where (??) Nuts! Like racing inside a Bathtub!

What the perfect track sauce is? Each try on a course or track configuration brings new thoughts and challenges. We try to bring the best effort to what's  in front of us. Right or wrong board set-up, we learn and get better. I like the idea of having a board capable of being tuned to the apication, whether running a flat out or short track. Some may find a board purpose built to suit a track layout better.  What's right? Well it's what wins.üèÅüèÅ And we hope by the next one it's someone else with a better sled is changing the game again.  End result is that Joe Cruiser has a more stable, manuverable and reliable ride. As for track layout, let's try all of them. The uphill at Barrett poses a whole new different dicipline of rider and machine. Should be fun and there is a pigpile we will learn from it. 
What @davidbonde has is fantastic opportunity to explore his board set-up and make factual comparisons.  Something that is getting done the right way. Short trackers can take David's work to the bank.

I felt really good on the track today. Comfortable and in control.

I changed the gearing from 16/42 to 13/42 (it is really hard to find 12t or 18t with keys). This gearing felt really good. Did not reach max speed and I felt that the acceleration was plenty. Braking felt better as well. When the battery drained it felt like the acceleration and speed did not suffer as much as the other gearings I have tried. I might have fund the perfect gearing for this track. I will try to find a 12t and see how that feels. (If you want to know why I tried this gearing, read Moe¬¥s suggestion in his post a little up.).

Focus was the same as last week. Out of turns in a straighter line. Finding the correct entry speed. beginning to actually break before a turn. Looking at the apex of the turn.

Today I could really lean in my frontside turns. Same feeling as with the six shooters. This is a great feeling and I think it makes me use more of the wheels grip. I have not maxed out the grip so I defiantly have more to gain from the grip.

I had my first slip of the race wheels. This was after a break where the wheels had collected a lot of dead rubber and stuff. I did not clean the wheels before I started and it was the first turn, and I hit it hard. It was a controlled and slow slip. Good to experience how a slip with these wheels feels like. Makes me more secure that it was not a sudden and fast slip.

I did two new best laps today first 37.09 and when a few laps after I broke the 37 limit so now the best lap time is 36.96

41.50 sec
40.50 sec.
38.93 sec.
38.53 sec.
37.67 sec.
37.49 sec.
38.78 sec.
37.19 sec.
36.96 sec.

Next week we will have our second groupe ride on the track. Looking foreward to that.

I can turn and carve really hard with 6 shooters but as I'm seeing pnumatic tires flex while turning way more than regular skate wheels so they kinda pop you back and forth as you carve and actually feels nice but for high speed cornering I would not have the same confidence as my 107s because of that extra movement. I once planned for. 50+ mph 6 shooters build and I did make it but pnumies just don't feel safe above 30mph they get Shakey and wobble the faster you go and regular skate wheels feel glass smooth even at 47mph. 

The good thing about pnumies is that if you can't make that turn you can keep riding straight into the grass and not fall haha.

I don't have the same experience as you. On the track (tight cornering)  pneumatics are PU superior. The grip can't be compared. 
On the street I just love pneumatics. They give me all the confidence that PU wheels take. I have never been faster than 35.5 mph, so don't know if I get faster than that. 
Moe's race wheels are rubber as well. They have bigger contact path than the shooters, and the rubber are really sticky. Makes a slimy sound when I go slow.They have more grip than the shooters.

Just like Formula One qualis. They go out to the track just with enough fuel (no our concern) for two laps. They do the first lap coming out of pits (about 2,5 kilometers) just to warm up the tires and then jump for the stint on the second flying lap and thats the time for the quali. Thats how they attempt qualification day with 3 qualis (Q1, Q2 and Q3). 

As each quali ends, the 10 last riders with poor time are left for back places on the starting grid. Q1 assigns 21th to 30th places, and so on, Q2 assingns 11th to 20th place and finally Q3 assigns 1st to 10th places on the grid. 

For all, teams use already worn down tires from previous practice days which are better than brand new ones that hasn't been broken. Rubber compounds are already exposed and scratched by the track's surface on the broken tire making it ideal for that precise quali lap and not needing previous extra warming laps (which under the F1 quali format are un available anyhow).

New week new session.

I find it really difficult breaking hard before corners. Today I had a feeling that I was trying too much. Ideally I should wait to the last moment and then break hard only shortly when I am still in a straight line. I easily either break to much meaning that I loose speed or break too little meaning I have too much speed in to the corner. It also makes the balance tricky as these hard stops easily throws me a little off balance. But its actually more the acceleration afterwards that can throw me off balance more.

I then tried to forget about the braking a little and had focus on having a smooth feeling around the track. Not being that agressive on the breaks and the acceleration. That felt awesome. It felt nice to be able to work with the trigger more smoothly other than full throttle or hard breaking. I felt that I could start the acceleration out of corners sooner. Maybe I just felt more in control.

I improved my best lap again by 0,30 of a second.

I stayed afterwards and looked at an experienced karting person doing his practice. His trainer talked me through the track. And he was pretty clear. If you want to go fast you need to do hard breaking as late as possible. He could see that I on my board could be thrown out of balance when breaking hard. But he was just like ‚Äúthen you need to practice!‚Äù. Ok I will‚Ä¶

To be honest I think the thing for me is, that I really don‚Äôt know my board that well. I need to become way more experienced breaking hard and acceleration hard. I feel that I a still entering the unknown when I do that. I feel a little embarrassed writing this, but when I look at it I think its true.

I Had like five laps today under 37 sec. And as the 37 sec. was a first time only one week ago, I guess I have a lot of improvements in me still.

I have been experimenting with a high grip gravity setup that is easy to lean 25+ degrees right and left.  This allows you to dive hard into the turn, compress the board causing a brake effect without actually using the brakes and literally spring you out of the turn when you want it to based on how and when you release the carve. Adding power will theoretically assist to drive you out of the carve.  The setup acts more like a superbike than a skateboard as the rider's position in turns is very deeply angled.  What angle can you lean your board @davidbonde?  This is the setup, 33 degree front and zero to 3 degree rear:![52|690x388](upload://ru6qmj3fohD6QPme4jH6JvIlgF.jpeg)

I had company on the track yesterday. It was the first time I drove close with others. We did not race, but there was this other guy who didn‚Äôt just let me pass.

I had to work for the pass finding the right moment and doing other than perfect lines. This was very fun and giving it a grain of new complexity. 

A couple of times I fund myself wanting a bit more maneuverability to mingle my way around him. Meaning I wanted a smaller turning circle. I have the board set up right now so it fits the perfect line of the track. 

But this ‚Äúfighting‚Äù with another on the track might speak for a different set up. Either new baseplate angles or maybe the TKP kind of trucks would do great here. I have a set coming my way eventually. 

@Alphamail  Thats interesting. I dont fully understand what you mean by the leaning degree. Do you mean which angle my board can do compared to the ground? Like in the picture?

Is that a Carveboard with the rear truck mounted on the flat part of the tail? Are you using urethane eggs in the trucks? I have a Carveboard sitting here that I want to electrify this year, and anything I can learn from you about improving the riding experience would be great. I'll definitely try to dewedge the rear truck if it needs more stability, but I realize this board is all about deep carving and not high speed.

Ahh now I think I now what you mean. Mmm... leaning, I don't know but I think I have way more in me. The thing is that the more I lean the more fucked I would be if the wheels slip. Especially in toe side turns. But it is something I am working on because I think I can throw my self in to corners faster if I lean more. I will check some of my video and see how much I lean. And one thing is sure it's an awesome feeling doing a corner and my head is way in over the barrier - hanging there.

Yes, the angle of the board in reference to the horizontal plane.  As with the superbikes, you need to keep your CG low (knees bent, crouched position, braced for acceleration / deceleration).

mmm... it seems they are a huge roadblock. They go to a certain point and then no more. Maybe its this I have always been feeling with those trucks. Its like they have a dead stop. Do you think I can compensate with some cones with the small end toward the hanger? Or should I seriously consider the milling mod?
I feel I defiantly want more lean.
They are not an optimal design when I think about it. What is the gain of such seats?

No perceivable advantage to the seat design in the SZ TKP's for what you are trying to achieve.  You have tried cones?  Not sure if flipping the Cones would help.  Did you determine the angle from horizontal you are able to achieve?

I get 17 degrees and then full stop. I can then push it to 20 degrees before wheels lift. But the last 3 degrees dont feel right.
I have not tried cones yet. Or I had them in but took them out without trying them. They didnt feel right (did not change the dead stop feeling as I thought they might do). I will try them again and see. I only have one set. 
I have a set of tkp coming at one point.

Today it was front wheel drive day!! 

I had done the work of swapping baseplates and bushings and invited the motor direction. The setup was not completely the same as last week as there was something with the distance between the wheels that I could not get to be the same because of stuff with the drivetrain and more. But it was close. I also had changed the rear boardside bushing from fatcone to a barrel in the same duro 90a. 

I took off and it felt really good. Its hard for me to put my finger on what it was. It just felt good. ‚Äúmaybe its the ‚Äúchange something‚Äù phenomena we know from General Motors that I have experienced through all for this. Its like every time I make a change it feels better‚Äù. Anyway it felt good. Something had changed with the steering and it felt good to have most of the weight in front where I also have the most of my body weight.  

I did like ten minutes going easy, getting to learn the new setup. I started to put more effort and speed in to the laps AND THEN‚Ä¶ In the first lap where I put it all in there, the rear wheels slid in a heel side 90 degree corner. It was like the board just vanished under my feet and I had no chance of recovering. mmm‚Ä¶ that took the good spirit out of me for the rest off the session, and I never got really fast today. 

I am still trying to figure out what happened. It was going really well in that lap. I felt I was flying. Maybe I simply had to much speed into the corner. I defiantly had more than I used to, but in a controlled way and it felt good. Maybe it was because I accelerated to quickly out of the corner. The acceleration takes away some of the turning grip. Maybe the lesser weight from the move of the motors to the front decreased the grip in the rear. Maybe it was because there was a lot more dead rubber on the track today. They told me that the karts all had gotten new wheels this week which drop rubber more. But they said that the dead rubber normally makes the karts grip more. I don‚Äôt know but I fell :) 

I experienced one time a slight spin in one acceleration. It must be important to really keep most of the weight in the front. 

But there is something about this front wheel drive and set up I had today that felt really good. I will keep the set up and continue next week and see if I can get closer to why it feels good and see if I can be really fast with front wheel drive.

When you swapped drive train did you leave the rear tires on the rear??  Ingraved on the inside lip of the wheels are compound numbers. 410 50a and go on the front. 405 is 45a, 5a softer and go on the rear.  The lighter weighted side gets the softer compound race wheel.

This style of track racing has a low percentage of long straight sections so I suggest running the bushings loose with virtually no compression especially the front.  This will allow for quick changes in direction and if the bushings are the correct duro and a compound like KranK, you will be able to dive hard into them and they will support you in the turns.  The Carveboard I am experimenting with does not have any preload capability so I am finding some previously unrealized advantages of a loose center.

I think thats how I had it Yesterday. Dobbelt barrel krank and just tightened so the slope in the hanger was gone. 87 in front and 90 rear. It felt good but the sudden stop from the seats was now and then was irritating. I have a set of 87 cones. I might try to have them in front and the 87 barrels in rear.
I also have two sets of 93 barrels I could play with.

Holy Baby Jesus. This is a long thread. There is a lot of good information here. 

 The little bit of track racing I have done. I learned that urethane wheels grip nicely before the track gets dusty,  then pneumatics with less air pressure excel in performance. Stooge race wheels are the exception, they are super grippy and I feel that once he makes an adapter to mount his wheels on regular skateboard trucks. That‚Äôs all we will see on e-boards at the track and uphill. 

  With a lot of turns and a max speed of about 25-30mph in a straight away, you can use softer bushings in a split angle downhill setup. This will keep you from having to replace your feet in turns. Also if you use a front foot stop and a Wedge rear foot stop. You can heal into the rear wedge during turns for sharper turns with less lean and more control under throttle. The front foot stop will allow you for harder braking  without falling off. P.S.  if you use a rear wedge you‚Äôre going to want to put a little softer bushing on the rear roadside  because of your new center of balance and weight distribution over the board. 

As far as decks for track use. I like top mounts over drop through because the front truck is closer to my front foot and allows for more steer. Also, Because of my stance. I like using a fairy short deck 43‚Äù.  I like to use a rear foot stop and stand with my feet about shoulder width apart, So... a shorter deck brings the rear truck closer to my center of balance over the board and allows me an even turn radius under throttle. 

Another thing I have found is FWD and crossWD (1f/1rD ollin style) setups give a better overall feel with less slip than RWD or Solid axle AWD. I have not tried an AWD with independent drivewheels. But might be really nice.



Good luck with your build!

Short update. 

I said it before and I will say again. This is hard!!! 3-5 laps full effort and I need a break or need to decrease the effort significantly! 

No best time today. Its hard constantly chasing best time, so today I focussed a bit more on ‚Äújust‚Äù getting flow and doing laps sub full effort. 

The setup was the same as last week (did swap wheels so the softer duro was in the rear). It feels pretty good, but now its second time without time drop. Will keep the fwd one more week and change back if I still don‚Äôt get close to time drop. 

What Biggest take home from today‚Ä¶ DO NOT THROTTLE FOR REAL BEFORE YOU HIT THE APEX.

Gotta try this. Would be nice to have something to push in to. Especially in backside turns pushing with the toes. 
Frontside turns I grab and pull the board. Thinking of having a handle to grab. 

Deck wise... I have a top mount but with a drop. The drop gives me something to push against but it takes the front foot away from the truck. 

[quote="JAYSTCB, post:168, topic:75142"]

[/quote]

My guess would be that this is most useful in a race with more people on the track. Here you need to be able to do a tighter turn in order to pass in a less perfect raceline. For going fast without any other on the track I fund that the board can be set up so it fits the perfect race line giving me more stability under acc. and deacc.  

I think the perfect set up for track racing is a bit different from what I have. My thoughts are a deck without drop. Something to help push against with feet. And handle/s to grab and pull in turns.

Ok.... awesome day at the track today. I was flying. Everything just felt goooood. Guess it was one of those days where I couldn't do anything wrong. 
Didn't change anything from last week. 

I ended up focusing on wide turns in some of the corners. Wider meant faster. And concentrating on hitting the apex close to the barrier. 

I was pretty consistent today. If I put in the effort I was easily under 37sec. every lap. I haven't been this consistent before. 

I don't know about front wheel drive though. Had a couple of over steers and some spinning when accelerating now and then. The spinning comes when I move my front foot between corners. I need to move the foot. I need the edge to push against in both frontside og backside corners. I will leave it fwd for now though. 

Looking forward to see if the extra stability from a longer board does something good for me when the 44 comes from Jamie. And to see what the tkp's will do.

Well done. Sounds like everything was clicking for you. In most sports I've tried, I've found that after a lot of intense practice, analysis and unexplained "off" days, stepping away and sleeping on it for a few days helps things click into place effortlessly the next time out.

Now that you've tried RWD and FWD, is 4WD next?

Yeah I have the same experience with sports. In my younger days I was competing at the world series in fencing for 20 years and I fund that I never really could know when when the unexplained off or good days would be there. Tried to find a parttern but never did. 

4wd must be next to try. When I get some more experience with more gear, I think I will try to build a dedicated track board featuring all I have learned. But there are still things to explore before I am ready for that.

I went to the track yesterday with my new Xapham deck from mr. Jamie. I knew it wouldn‚Äôt be, but I couldn‚Äôt help naively thinking that it would be enough just to swap deck. It wasn‚Äôt‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt change anything but the longer deck, the Xapham is, from the setup with the Obeah6 deck. It didn‚Äôt work! 

The turning capabilities and feeling was totally changed, and it didn‚Äôt feel good. I was far from being fast when cornering and I was far from my best lap time (4sec). It just didn‚Äôt feel right. 

After 45 min. of frustration it was clear that I needed to work on the wedging and maybe the bushings. Right now the setup is: Front: 55degrees and double barrel 87a krank. Rear: 35degrees and double barrel 90a krank. I think the bushings are ok and I want to work on the wedging first. Thinking of making it 60 front and 50 rear. to begin with. Any other suggestions?

Apart from the cornering here are my first time on the track thoughts on the longer deck. 

**Cons:** 

Length: I might get too wide a stance. When locoking in both feet between the drop and the W concave it feels a bit too wide when cornering. The feeling is that I loose some of the capability to push with my feet. Might just be that I need to get used to this wider stance. Don‚Äôt know. I defiantly need a wider stance from the Obeah deck, but maybe this is too much. Let me get more time on the this deck and see if this feeling continues. 

Oversteering: It seemed that this set up is a little more prone to oversteering. Maybe because of the added length? 

**Pros:**

Length and width: This defiantly gives more stability. And the acceleration can be pushed with this. 

Drop and concave: The drop on the Xapham are deeper than the Obeah. The rear drop works great as support when acceleration hard. The added length and the bag drop gave a nice feeling when acceleration from zero. 

Let‚Äôs see what happens when I dial in the wedging. 

Even though the drop is a nice support I have been wondering if a no drop deck would give an advantage with some added leverage over the trucks. One day I will find out.

Front wheel drive: I really don‚Äôt know‚Ä¶ wheels spin easier and I might just like the weight in the rear. I had traction control on this time, but it didn‚Äôt seem to do anything. Does the traction control work between wheels. So when one wheel spins it controls that wheel. Or is it also when both wheels spin (@Hummie)? 
Will keep the FWD while dialing in the wedging and then change and see what I like best.

Traction control won‚Äôt let one wheel spin out when riding. Maybe if could let two wheels spin out if powered enough but it won‚Äôt let a single wheel spin. I notice it on sharp turns where a wheel comes unweighted and would otherwise spin out or when on wet leaves braking downhill

If oversteer is the issue (turning too much and causing the rear end to slide), I think you will be better off reducing the front wedge to 50 or 45 degrees keeping the rear at 35 to move towards understeer and find the centerpoint between oversteer and understeer.

Wanting to define on this a bit more.   Oversteer would mean your losing the rear or have a loose or free setup. (As per auto lingo)   
How much turn input effort compared to old setup?
Did it feel like you need more grip on the rear?
Does it feel like the trucks are locking out at any point in the turn?

To much sideways not enough forward. Reach in front of the board(past the front wheels) in the direction you intend to go. like you are reaching out to start a slide. change your center of gravity and the board will follow. 

most hands down slides when being explained not moving look like  side to side movements, they aren't, its the deck falling over, your center of gravity is still mostly centered over the deck left to right, but you are reaching forward into the left or right quadrant. 

basically, act like you are going to slide, without the setup carve, don't deweight, and don't put your hand down. Reach into the corner with one hand, just as much as you pull the deck with the other hand.

tl;dr just like slides, turns are all about extension

What's impressive is : the same thing should work pretty good on skates. I'll get that and report, thanks for the tip !

Hey man, have you ever watched Olympic speed skaters? I've mentioned this in another post about your head  leading your body

https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/how-to-keep-balance-and-ensure-i-dont-wipe-out-going-20-mph/55962/12?u=deckoz

Speed boarding and speed skating our heads lead, and our arms are mostly detrimental to our bodys center of gravity. Which for us is our head. If you notice, alot of speed boarders and speed skaters, like Olympic speed skaters, keep their hands behind their back, with their head leading, to maintain perfect balance, and minimize wind drag etc. But your head is always the center of gravity, as its where we maintain the feeling of balance. You can draw a line from our head to our feet to determine the angle of pressure. If how far we extend, is a principal of fulcrum length, but our arms are mostly detrimental, what if we use our arms as an extension of our center of gravity. Pointing your arms in the direction of your head, where you are looking or going. 

While our heads are the primary extension, we can modulate levels of grip, balance, turn in, and feel, by extension of our center of gravity (adding weight past the head - our center of balance)

Thanks Brad. I don't completely understand what you write. The first 3 pictures you post the center of cravity is nothing but over the deck? 

The thing is... the more I lean forward the more I feel that I "loose" the rear wheels, having a feeling they can slip easier because they have less weight on them. When I have experienced oversteer it seems to be better when I put some more weight on my rear leg to get some more traction on the rear wheels. 

[quote="Deckoz, post:190, topic:75142"]

[/quote]

When I do tight turns with high speed I feel that I need to hang out therein order to counter weight the turning forces. 
These speed skaters center of gravity are almost as far from their "boards" as they can get. If their skates slip they are fucked as well. Thats what I mean. 

![image|666x500](upload://4zbrTC4bQ3CImkqlF1LR4VvGm1r.jpeg) 

But again, I might not completely understand what you mean. 

It would be awesome to be able to do a curve (open or tight) where I can be much more over the board, so I am up for any suggestion, that I can try out on the track. 

Maybe I can get you to explain again with different wording? I know you have already used a  lot of words and might not be able to find others. Maybe I could get you to spend a minute watching this video and tell me what you see?

[quote="MoeStooge, post:189, topic:75142"]
Oversteer would mean your losing the rear...
[/quote]
Yes that's what I experience. With the longer deck I feel that I get less weight on the rear, giving it less traction and then more prone for sliding out. 

[quote="MoeStooge, post:189, topic:75142"]
How much turn input effort compared to old setup?
[/quote]

I felt that I need to put in more effort to turn - bigger turning radius. Needed to push sideways in to the board more. Making me feel that its not only the boards own turning force that push the board sideways bit that I had to do it as well. Thats why I think I need to work on the wedging and see if I can chance this.

[quote="MoeStooge, post:189, topic:75142"]
Did it feel like you need more grip on the rear?
[/quote]

mmm... hard to tell. But year I think so. 

[quote="MoeStooge, post:189, topic:75142"]
Does it feel like the trucks are locking out at any point in the turn?
[/quote]

Not yet. Feels like I can work with wedged to give it more turning without the trucks locking up. 

I still can't figure out completely what it was that didn't feel right. I think the main two things was the turning effort/radius which gives meaning as I didn't change wedging or bushings from the shorter deck. And secondly the feeling of having less weight over the rear truck because of the added distance between legs, and with me always having more weight on the front leg. 

I felt that I couldn't let go and give it full effort in the corners and of of the corners. Couldn't hang there and counter the g-force with all I have. 

But this was my first time on the deck. Maybe its just because I need more time on it to lean the new behavior. I will see if I can get some time on the deck this weekend out side and see if I can find out what to change before next weeks track session. If anything.

Ok I saw this video: This is what @Alphamail  suggested some posts ago. This is also what I feel I need to do when cornering. 

"but as you comes into the corner you shift your weight to distribute it through all four wheels of the board so you can maximize your grip"

From 2:56 and 15 sec. forward

It's all about grip.

With your past experience from adjustment successes, the first thought is usually correct.  With the longer wheel base and lower gravity center I think you're right to start with adding truck angle.

 What has worked for me when trying to find a workable point in a baseline setup. 
"Make one change at a time."  If you make multiple changes you could be masking one new problem and fixing another. 
When you go to track test have an alternative setup plan ready.

100% correct. An unloaded wheel has less grip. The 50/45 duro split is for this very reason.  Front axel is naturally loaded more than the rear with the exception of hard accel. The Dynamics of what your doing (accel, decel, lateral loading) is all extreme when compared to gravity on PU. Relying on rear grip by committing more weight to it is a bit of a leap of faith, but necessary. Like finding a balance setup with a car, weight distribution is just as important to balance grip on a raceboard. By softening the rear wheel compound, it allows the front to be loaded more while maintaining overall balance grip. Balanced grip is ultimately determined by the riders application of weight distribution front to rear.
 Loading the rear in a turn feels unnatural.  I can see how with the new wider stance the tendency to unload the rear would be automatic.  Looking fwd to the next setup and progress report.

Am I wrong in thinking grip is largely determined by duro no matter what the material within reason? I looked a lot online.  There may be better rebound to different materials but if it‚Äôs soft and fills the tiny indents in the road surface you stick no?   People were saying air tires stick better but that seems because they let so much air out and they deform to the surface better; if they pumped up those tires it would be a hugely different grip story just like with a bike.

I can speak for rubber. It's all about matching duro/compound to applied force, surface temp and surface type.  To hard you lose grip, to soft you lose grip. One compound will make good grip on a 130f track surface and be undesirable at 150f. There is always speed to made with the correct compound for the application. You're only as good as your contact patch.

with a small contact patch you'd want softer I imagine and it seems the contact patch can be compensated for.      but it seems there's no sure winner of grippiest material.   PU could be just as good as nitrile if soft enough, or as you say possibly hard enough, for the course.

I haven't tried rubber yet but with my inlines good PU makes wonder on dry surfaces. Sticky AF with the thin patch! Depending on duro compound there's still lot of room for more grip than I currently have.

On wet roads tho........

Lately I have been bitching about the SR venturi hanger seats that physically block lean. Yesterday and today I have played with cone bushings (87a krank) in the front truck. I tried every possible configuration and this worked best. 

![image|500x500](upload://n8P8Ea3Y6QIH54v57X3C7yqKKLj.jpeg) 

It‚Äôs opposite of what @Alphamail suggests how the cone bushing should be mounted. This takes away some of physical barrier. There is still some phycsical barrier and it‚Äôs not perfect but it seems to be close. I would like the lean feeling to be perfect, so I will still try to do the SR mod.  Though I think I could give the front a couple of degrees more in wedging and make this set up better. I properly will do that, but I want to see how this performs on the track. 

I think I will get closer to what I want by also using  his cone setup (90a) in the rear truck. I just need to order some more cones and that takes time. 

I also changed the truck base to 50 degrees rear. So now the set up is: Front: 55 degrees. double cone 87a krank (narrow end toward hanger). Rear: 50 degrees. double barrel 90a krank. 

It feels plenty stable. I am close to the lean and turning I want. Lets see how it performs on the track this week. 

I also explored the weight distribution front to rear while doing turns. It feels kinda ok to put more weight on the rear leg, when I began to overcome the natural want of putting most of the weight on the front foot. 

I feel prepared for the track now :slight_smile:

Actually now that you mention it, there are also special PU wheels for rain and it sticks like mad. Also durability is lower and I think rolling resistance is higher ?

Edit : also you usually just swap the middle wheels not a full set to keep nimble front and rear wheels.

Do you think you can try and record your apex corner speed? With a mic included earphones or headphone or BT headset and a vocal speedometer ? Or maybe a smartwatch haha

There's a free app available on Google store, I didn't have enough battery yesterday to run both Strava + Real-time vocal speedo so went for Strava alone.

Hmmm actually an HUD screen in helmet would really be a game changer for this type of racing üèÅ

You can get away with flipping the Cones in cases where the hanger / kingpin space is filled as with a spherical or the SZ surfkeys, otherwise there will be unpredictable sideshift as the bushing attempts to find the bushing seat wall.  This can also lead to sideloading the kingpin with a mechanical lock and eventually kingpin failure which can be catastrophic.  Please pay attention to what is going on, this is not for the faint of heart...

I have learned the following since last update‚Ä¶ 

The weather have been pretty nice so I have had some time on the street where I could dail in the trucks. I needed more turning so I increased the wedge in the front from  57 to 65 and still had the cone bushings flipped. But this made the front truck do a ‚Äúclonk‚Äù movement where the it all of a sudden shifted quickly when leaning. So I flipped the bushings back to normal. 

![image|666x500](upload://oLcW8fv0qZE7QXmE5zlCin7T0IU.jpeg) 

This took away the ‚Äúclock‚Äù movement. The 65 front truck felt pretty good and I was eager to try it on the track. 

But there is still something that‚Äôs not dialed in. It felt a lot better than last week, but I was still far from being fast. My gut feeling tells me it‚Äôs the turning because of the longer deck. It feels like the changed turning from the longer deck can‚Äôt be compensated so it feels good. I could try to wedge even further but something tells me thats not going to solved the problem. 

I simply don‚Äôt feel that the longer deck I have tried the last two times is ideal for the track I am on. There are different things that makes me say this. 

First the turning has changes as I describe above and I feel that I can‚Äôt compensate through dialing the trucks and bushings. 

Second it seems that I do not use the full length of the board. I naturally have my feet closer than the full plantform. If I dont use the full platform, I can‚Äôt see why I should have the longer platform as it changes the turning as I described. 

Third, when I force my self to use the full platform it ads to the impaired turning. 

Fourth, It feels like the deck is too wide. I need to have the the edge under my feet when turning in order to get the lean I need. Therefore I have to move my feet. I now many of you say that I should not move my feet but I have to. If I dont get the edges under my feet the turning sucks. I want to try a board that is narrow enough that I have both edged under my feet so I dont have to move them. At least where I have my feet. When the rest of the board can be wider - I don‚Äôt know. I am in the proces of learning to press decks so I will prototype my way through it in the time to come. 

Or I should see what bindings might do. 

On the positive side the longer deck did give me more stability and a better platform for accelerating and braking.

I will change back to the shorter deck and see if I get back to being fast again. If I do I know that this deck was not ideal for me. And then I am eager to set up the Xapham for the street with the sixshooters :) 

But on the shorter deck, I did feel that I needed a longer one. So maybe a deck in between. Time will tell.

Holding out for the hanger mod is a good idea.  Also is there room for shortening the wheel base by drilling new baseplate holes. Shortening the wheelbase 40mm could be a step in the right direction or make the difference. Research and development, don't be afraid to chop the deck. Narrow that thing up and modify it to what suits your needs. Its a beautiful deck. In my eyes performing a function is what makes a deck beautiful. DH guys chop cut and customize their own personal performance details into deck design.
