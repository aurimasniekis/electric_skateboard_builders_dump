I want a penny board with a decent truck width so that it is still relatively stable to ride. Would like 10 miles or so. This caught my eye and was the inspiration... but no way im paying north of 1500 bucks just for the drive system.....

Onan kits are cheaper.  I don't know if they are good or not tho.

Might take some enclosure modding but it doesn't get much cheaper than these
