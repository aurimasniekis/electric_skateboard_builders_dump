I really just carry the basics, a toolset with all bits you would ever need a spare belt my charger and my skatetool.

Sometimes a spare remote depending on the board and a powerbank.

You keep that all in a single smaller bag inside your pack? I probably need to have a spare tire or tube cause numies

Edit:
In addition to your other tools like the hex set ofcourse :smile:

nothing whatsoever.  Empty bag then full on the way home with beer usually.  My pal is currently using my trailer board for work though and he carries a full compliment of plumbing maintenance tools with him.  This has the added problem for me though because now all I can carry is 2 six packs in my backpack as opposed to the full carton in the trailer.  first world problem.

it certainly is.  Its an old deck with the back truck on and connects to the drive board with an aluminium bar that attaches to the baseplate located on top of the rear trucks.  Has a milk crate bolted to it and carries a full 24 pack of beer no worries.  miss it dearly

A mini fire extinguisher isn't a bad idea actually. maybe not for my day bag, but maybe my "lets see how far i can get on my battery" bag. Or for a group ride. ( like that will happen here..... it would be me and @monsterbuilder )

Same...done some modifying upgrades..rebuilds.

Got one on the way from @psychotiller at the moment maybe on its way or will be soon.
Just for a moment I thought could I put it together myself...I guess so..there would be a lot of mistake...part and parcel of learning. 

On the other hand...
I'd much rather have the Dingo Dangly make my board  any day anytime.... lol

"Better than trying to piss on it"... electricity...battery fire..

I actually always carry a tiny bit of superglue (and a needle) in my purse :sweat_smile:


I usually don't take a bag with me when I go for a ride but always carry my keys, my smartphone, my purse, an isulin pen with needle + a bit dextrose (cus type 1 diabetis) with me.  And well for the board I have a (makita) bit-set-screwdriver-thingy which sits in a box together with the dual ESCape, bluetooth module and ppm receiver thats it.

same here, 23 or so years of carrying. I upgraded to various Leatherman multitools for the past 6 years, but the blade is always the most useful. I went to a kids birthday party this weekend and  no one had a knife to cut the balloon ribbons. I always weird people out because I have two blades on me. What is so wrong about being prepared for something so simple?!
