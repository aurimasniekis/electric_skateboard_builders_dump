Hi! I am the proud owner of the [Street Slayer](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/street-slayer-dual-6374-190-kv-12s5p-flipsky-6-6/68413/73)
The current version is build on Jet Invasion transport series deck, the deck is pretty sweet TBH, but with the current mods, cuts and dremelled places, I don't trully trust the deck and the build as a whole is not, what it could be.

So! What I would like to ask is, what would be the best deck for me to build on, that would last and look rook solid? I had a few options such as trampa carver, that I'm absolutly in love with, but I'm preety sure the stance is not for me ufortunatly. As for a regular deck my thoughts were on LY switchblade 40, that is a bit flexable and probably would have some wheel bite with gummies. Also subsonic Talon, but the drop is a bit to much for me, and not really a fan of the long ends. I'm looking for a drop through+drop deck, I really wanted something more exotic, but options that would work for me are narow, also because of the agresive drop, Redember decks would not do good for me.
In the end, it comes down to hummies deck. It is long and wide, I like a pretty wide stance, it has a slight drop, alows drop through mounting and offers a really premium looking posssible finish, if you do the work right, also it's kinda buletproff, but it is a common deck, the only thing that i kinda dislike.
So is the humie for me, or did i mised anything?

You need @Sender to work his magic on a Hummie deck. That way you could have a true one off.
I love the decks but I am unashamedly biased as I sell them over this side of the pond and I make enclosures for them..

Not to take anything away from @Sender boards because when he skins them they are top notch. I do custom with woodburned graphics on it.

![image|500x500](upload://1X6WhZSgNsNWQ6s7EOsVc8UyC2r.jpeg) 

40 inches long 9.5 wide that narrows to 8.5 in the vent with 30 top mount drop down.
