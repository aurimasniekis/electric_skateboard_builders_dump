Hi,

You can buy a 1 year warranty on their site.

Oh... So may I buy a focbox from one of their suppliers and then warranty from enertion? Seems OK but it would be 2x more expensive.
Anyway thanks for the answer :)

Buy the focbox from a reseller, your going to wait ages for it to arrive otherwise
