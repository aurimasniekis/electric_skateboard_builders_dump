Anyone else experiencing issues with opening topic pages and the loading wheel continuing to spin even though the page is loaded.  Whenever I open an topic i have to hit the stop and then hit refresh.

I'm using google chrome as a bowser

Although there was some transient packet loss across the states at around 7:45am...not sure if that's causing it. Seems like the issue was resolved. Hopefully that means the forum will go faster now!

Yea, I did some digging here, we host the majority of the .builder domain here, not sure if this site is on it but the issue I saw was affecting any customers, it was all internal tooling that was seeing the slow downs.

So yep, not my fault!

I dont use IE I hate that crappy browser.  I was testing the forum on that browser to see if it was a chrome browser issue.

IE is the most commonly used browser to download other browsers with.
