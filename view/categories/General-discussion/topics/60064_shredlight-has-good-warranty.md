my lights are beyond warranty period. I bought it a yr ago and they replace both sleeves and bracket because They ripped and broke. 
but they replaced for free (international shipping too) without asking much.
It is not much money and little thing, yet makes me feel good.

Eric is a cool dude. Ridden with him a few time. I get tired just watching him ride his Riptide like a surfboard.

I can back that too. I had few issues with their products and they sent me new ones without any question.
