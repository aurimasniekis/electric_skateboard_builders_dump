# Mounting 3D printed boxes - Would these leave too big a gap? Alternatives?

So my plan is to drill holes and screw/glue wood-inserts into the board itself. I think that's the normal way of doing things? 

When it comes to actually mounting my NESE battery modules, VESC and BMS to the board though, I see there being a couple of options - 

1) Just use a bolt through the nese and straight into the board, mounting the nese flush to the board. Would seem to be the simplest and most sturdy, but would not have much vibration-dampening and there'd be no gap to run wires safely. 

2) Same as 1, but add in some rubber washers in between the nese and the board. Slight dampening, and a small gap to have the balance wires running safely out of harms way. (I plan to use pretty thick rubber washers, or a stack of a couple, not just one thin one). 

3) Same as 1 again, but instead of washers using [these](https://www.verpas.co.uk/m-vibration-dampers-anti-vibrations-bobbin-mounts-stop-buffers/anti-vibration-bobbin-mount-type-tp-b-waisted/tapered-rubber-metal-damper-type-tp-b-d10-4-5-h8-m3x6/). Much better vibration dampening, but would leave an 8mm gap between the nese and the board which is pretty sizable. 


Just thought I'd bring this here and see what people suggested. My thinking is that 3 is going to be the most protective of the nese, but the gap would be a bit much. 2 might be the best compromise, but I'm not sure if the rubber washers in that situation will actually do anything at all to dampen vibrations.

For questions regarding a product people recommend that you do it in the product thread. That way it has more visibility(hence more response) and others benefit from it. And also so that we don't create extra threads for one question.

Is it really relevant to put there though? It's only a coincidence that I'm using a NESE module for this example, I'm also going to be mounting a VESC and a BMS in the exact same way. If I was using any other battery pack, I'd still be asking this same question. Seems like asking it in the NESE thread would be fairly off topic.

Edit: If I had asked the question as "How to mount 3D printed enclosures", which is actually more accurate, which thread would you have directed me to? (Edit 2: Have updated the original post for accuracy)
