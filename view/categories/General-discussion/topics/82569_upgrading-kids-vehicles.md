Thanks folks.

So the story goes that I bought my 18 month old grandson a second hand motorised ride on car, without first doing any research. 
I got blinded by the bling and cool factor.

It has about as much power as an elecric toothbrush. It runs about 2mph, so slower than adult walking pace, and doesn't have the guts to drive up dropped kerbs, so I have to give it a nudge.

Thinking it might have been the battery, I swapped out the 6v 7ah, for a 6v 12ah one, afterall, I've no idea how old the battery is and I can get them for peanuts at work.
This didn't help.

Upon closer inspection it has only 1 x 6v motor, which is connected through a gearbox.

This sort of thing
![image|500x500](upload://oFkLaleL69hBSBRRArGt1HFRkS.jpeg) 

I'm now considering adding a second motor, but as I've no idea of the rpm and ratio of the current one, so I'll probably have to install 2 identical motors. Also adding 2 motors should in effect give it more torque, and if I choose a high rpm paired set, maybe a little more speed.

or should i upgrade it to 12v, and would 12v be any more beneficial to 6v.

He's only a baby, so it doesn't need to do burn outs or handbrake turns.

Will be a few more questions to come, based on your replies.

Thanks for taking the time. :slight_smile:

12v is PLENTY of speed for that age. The issue I ran into is the one wheel drive. My son would burn out the one wheel on 12v at any dead stop. I cut bike tires and screwed them to the tires to give more tread and it helped but I'd recommend 2 motors.

Yes. I'd do 2 motors at 6v and upgrade to 12v when he gets a feel for the speed.

My issue with upgrading to 12v is:

All the elctronics, 2.4ghz remote etc are all 6 volt.
So I can't just chuck a 12v battery in for fear of frying everything else.

I've considered the following.

I have a spare 12v 20ah battery in my garage, that I could shoe horn in to the battery compartment.
I replace the single 6v motor for 2 x 12v ones.
The wiring which feeds the current single motor wired through a relay, which energises the 12v power to the motors.
This way I can retain all the 6v side without fear of frying anything ?
```

or I just chuck another 6v motor in. (possibly a pair) and leave everything at 6v.

Ahh you're remotely powering it. The 6v motors can definitely take 12v. You may need a new receiver if you want to use the remote function but I expect that it would still work fine. It's only sending a pass/no pass signal to the controller, not taking a main power.

12 volt is a moderate adult jog. Be careful. You could also go in between and find a 9 volt. I can't recommend dual drive enough though.

I just thought of an issue with my 12v and relay idea.
As I'd be utilising the 6v motor signal to operate the relay, this would be either on or off, i'd lose the reverse function.

One ebay seller has about half a dozen 6v motors listed from 8,000 rpm to 20,000 rpm.
Of course this can't be at the wheel, otherwise, it would be off like a shot.

Lets assume that the current motor is 8,000 rpm (ive no way to tell as of yet), and I replaced it with 2 x 6v 20,000 rpm, this will help with the speed, but what about torque ?

```
The RPM value youre seeing is likely linked to the KV of the motor, higher KV -> Lower torque
and Lower Hv -> More torque

Seems that I ran out of post credits yesterday, apologies for what appears to be silence on my part. :cry:
I've never had a forum so strict, although I sort of understand why it is..
Have spammers and marketeers been a problem in the past ???
I must be honest, I did at one point, look at my profile with a view to deleting the account, as I couldn't work out how to post. I wonder how many other potential forum members have done this and left ??

So back to my little project.
Over night I decided it would be best to stick with 6v for the time being, as it makes things a little easier until he gets bigger or bored.

Does anyone have any experience with the motor/gearbox combo's I posted earlier.
From the ones I've seen online they seem to range from 8,000 to 20,000 rpm, but this will be measured at motor shaft and not the final drive.
A motor spinning at 16,000 rpm vs another at 8,000 won't nessesarily result in twice the speed, as I've no idea of the ratio difference between the two gear boxes, although twice the current speed would be ideal.

I guess I can't mis match motors/gearbox as one wheel would potentially be turning faster than the other causing the toy to go around in circles, which means i'll really have to replace the current one at the same time.
My initial thoughts on upgrading to 12v. If i'm going to replace 2 x 6v motors at a cost of Â£20, I might as well fit 2 x 12v for the same cost. But I didn't consider the additional work involved.

Thanks for the link by the way, lots of info on there to glean.

Not sure how much this helps your situation, but on my kid's 12v, 2wd, 2 speed Mini Cooper that went 2.5/5mph, I first overvolted to 6s Lipo (22-25v), and could literally do wheelies with my 180lb/75kg. ass in it. Double the speed and my 6 year old loved it. One day, while rushing to put two 6s batteries back in, my brain was in Esk8 mode and I accidentally wired them in series at 12s. My kid took off like a rocket in first gear, went about 20-30 feet, heard a POP, POP, and saw some sparks from under the car, by each rear wheel. By the time he rolled to a dead stop and his fun was over, I realized my mistake. Oops. So I did some research on modified power wheels forums, got some slightly faster stock replacement motors and settled on 4s as it still gives about 10mph top speed, which still makes my son happy.

My 3yo just got an 4wd jeep for his birthday. I have been trying to resist the urge to modify it.  Got it as a sample sale at a trade show for $50. But if I modify it I could easily spend $100 or more, so resisting the urge until he gets bored of its slow speed. It has 4 of the smaller 380 size motors, upgrading all of them to 540 size would be kind of expensive. 

![image|690x318](upload://e80Yc7gc0X1nR3aGbZKvRfF2P4f.jpeg) 

I have been researching parts and you can get all the electronics fairly cheep. They are just a box full of relays. and receiver for the remote.

So can you run a 12v system safely on 16v? 4s lipo might be an easy upgrade.  I just wonder what do about low voltage cut off? I could  put a cheap BMS on it but they are normally for lion and have 2.5v low voltage cut off which is far to low for lipo.

While my grandson is still a baby, i want to retain the 2.4gz remote function.
For fear of frying this, I really have to stick with 6v.

Of course, I may be tempted to upgrade it in the future.

Curiosity got to me had to check what was inside the controller. I need to check on the regulator to see how high the input voltage can be but the input power area is all 25v caps. 

The relays are 15amp 14 volt.
