Hi All,

Tomorrow (Oct 26th 2019) French driving regulation will be updated, and strong restriction will kill our hobby:
Individual transportation vehicle (category on which Scooters, boards, gyropods belong to) will have to be limited to 25 km/h by design and own lighting system (front and rear) approved breaking system (probably electric breaking will not be enough, perhaps they will require disc brake),
drivers will have to get approved helmet, and wear yellow jacket or reflective and approved clothes...
riders will have to be 12+ 
riders will have to use bicycle lines only or road when bicycle lines are not available...

if you **own** an engine able drive faster than 25 km/h (by design or because you've jail broken it) even if your board is not running, or your board is w/o approved lighting, breaking systems, you will have to pay 1.500‚Ç¨ (first time) and then 3.000‚Ç¨ each time!!!!!

So guys, before to spend your money into board, check regulation, France is dead!

Its always the same thing with news shity laws, some guys drive electric vehicles like cunt so justice must invent a law, they know many e-vehicles are "illegal" and cops have more to do to enforcing because 25kmh speed, for me it's dangerous behavior they tried to fight. 

ride smart, don't be a dumbass on your board and everything will be ok, France is not dead üòÇ

Not sure,
Light equipment will have to be attached to the board, and if they follow the same path that they took for motorbikes or cars, lights have  to be  switched on 24x7.

It is not the same to set speed limit to 25 kmh and restrict by design your board to 25 kmh and disallow everything that it is able to ride faster than 25kmh...

So only international manufacturers will be able to get approval tests and certification. Home made or assembled are dead in France and second hand market also.

Imagine to transfer this limitation to cars, no Tesla, BMW, not even a Prius nor a Renault Zo√© that are 150 kmh enabled 99% of std cars would be a out of law v√©hicules, you will have to drive a Twizy or Smart electric model, 

E-sk8 as we are expecting is dead.

No that's not if you own, that's if you **ride** it in public areas. But you're right, it's a very limiting factor. There are solutions. 

We need a MP group about that. We shall make it on the french forum IMHO.

French expat here, but still concerned about those policies!
So putting a profile with a 25km/h software limit can be seen as a valid restriction by design. 
VESC-Tool will let you do this kind of stuff, right? Default limiting profile set in, and unlimited one operational till reboot.

what happens if someone gears for 25kph no
load, then they go faster than 25kph downhill, could the bemf voltage above battery voltage the motor generates potentially blow a vesc? i think so... no wonder they require mechanical brakes. genius!

Hi @alexnz, I wish software will mitigate this crazy law. Couple of hours ago, Alex from LaCroix  email me that next week a video will be forwarded to his happy users to explain how to update vesc modules and adapt our configuration.
I don't know for how long you've left France. Since 15-20 years, politicians are triggering on events without any mid to long term forecasts. Governance are from lobbies and sync on elections calendar.

What stops someone from limiting their esc and bringing it back up when cops are gone? I think the "by design" will probably state something along the lines of "no possibilty of changing said limit of 25kmh"

Hi living in an overseas French territory here. It seems like they are trying to make those EV fit into categories. Maybe it is worth trying to have them accept to register your vehicle into another category like if it goes under 25km/h (but that‚Äôs weird I would assume they would measure the power instead of the speed) it may be like a moped (probably like the old Mobilette or something) and over that speed it could be registered into higher class like 50cc or 125cc with registration plates and all. I have seen 1 stand up scooter with registration plate earlier this month I did not ask the owner what was the power level of his scooter tho.

French are world champions with administration.
And our v√©hicules need to get registered from adminstration with constructor specification.

You cannot build your own vehicule, regulation, controles, fiscal taxes, etc... If you don't have all the paper with you you are going to loose a lot of bucks.

Imagine: if a professional is selling, giving, renting, exporting, importing, advertising a v√©hicule that is not validated he will have to pay 30.000 ‚Ç¨ per item, go in jail and loose the v√©hicule. A std rider will risk jail, 3000 ‚Ç¨ and loose also his driving licences for 3 years...
What do you think?
Custom electric board market is dead in France, events are deads also as boards will be out of laws...

If you speak French and have some trouble to get asleep read this or use Google translate:

Ha Ha Ha @Pura-Vida you're a drama queen :slight_smile:
I'm also french and yes the new law is quite restrictive but we need to know that esk8 was totally forbidden before  the law....  
First, the new law will not be effective before july 2020.
 
Second, were now recognized by the gouvernement as a vehicle and this is good.

Third, the speed limit is 25km/h like scooters, ebike and wheels.... ok is low but speed limit  in cities  (not highway ands national roads where speed limits are higher :) are 30km/h and 50km/h for cars and motorbikes... So from a legal point of view, it's seem legit.

The real problem here in France and specially Paris are the free floating scooters, not eskaters, cops are really cools with us. i commute mostly daily around 10kms and if you don't do stupid things no one cop will arrest you ! In Paris 95% of the eskaters wear helmets and 95% of the scooters don't wear helmets. Cops are not (all) stupids, we're not the target, respect others on the road, and you'll never have a problem...

Hope to see you all at the next "It's Electric" week end in july in Paris, i believe the second edition will be amazing !

Hi Fred, 
Please have a look on new "code de la route", it is not the speed limit to ride. But the restriction of the transportation engine.
Your board will have to be limited by constructor to 25kmh be equiped with front and rear lights, brakes and warning horn/ring...
To do promotion to sell, to rent, or propose services that deals with not approved engine will cost 30.000 ‚Ç¨ to a professional. To use it 3.000‚Ç¨ to a regular (or goofy) rider...
Check the text. You will have to get an insurance otherwise couple of hundreds of bucks, and the insurance will reclame documents to be sure that your board is approved...
So please check the text and then do some forecasts, sorry if your business model was in France, but our hobby is over, insert 3.000 other coins to shot again

i checked your link, it's the 2008 law... BY the way you're right concerning the 25Km/from factory but several constructors are already found some tips :) to allow you to ride the maximum speed (only on private roads, of course, ha ha ha)
The only bad point is concerning the DIY, yes you'll can't insure a diy board, as you can't insure a no street legal car...

Guy, law are voted by politicians, and politicians are targeting next election only, carbon reduction target, climat changes, you are speaking about action that won't get effect before 2050 as climate inertie is 30 years... most of politicians would be dead, or having tea with Alois Alzheimer

With more than 30% growth of individual eletcric vehicles crashes in a year in urban areas, one could have expect such regulation... and yes, just for this reason, I think this 25 kmh limitation is a good thing even if I personnaly practice downhill and also e-skate at higher speeds.

I would say it's a good "starting point" to recover a better feed-back of other citizens about our "community", because yes, whether we want it or not, we are in their eyes a single community whatever the vehicle we ride : a scooter, a bike, a skate ...

Of course such a regulation always comes with a heavy legislative material to discourage anyone to workaround this regulation etc... yet, if you look at what happened with 50cc motorcycle in the early 80s (or even today), well anyone with an unbridled 50cc motorcycle respecting the speed limitation in urban areas never really had problems.

So for me viewing this law just as a ban of our freedom is a big mistake, it's on the other hand a great opportunity to show a caring attitude in riding all together in the day to day commuting,  together with demonstrating the spectacular face of our discipline and rider skills, by mean of organized events. This is the only way to be mass adopted by our citizens and see the regulation evolve in the good sense in the future.

@Redfire1 No eboards are still 100% illegal. Scooters got legal 4 Months ago. (Max speed of 20km/h) You need insurance and some other things. Board still illegal no matter if you drive 5km/h or 40km/h

Synthetic,
I am using my LaCroix 50% off-road into a  park (gardens/parks of Versailles castle, and forest trails for bicycles and horses of Rambouillet domain) and 50% on the way to go from home to this location. So or it is possible to set different mod of the VX1 (one restricted to 25, another to 35, last full power) or I will use the unity app to switch from one mode to another.

You are wrong, 2 weeks ago police checked my documents as I was leaving castle park from a secondary exit. They were curious about the engine and wanted to know a lot about it's speed, range autonomy, price and weight..
To be honest, in Versailles they will check your documents as often as they are doing in North of Paris, main diff√©rence will education and how old and dirty is the cars and cycles.
In Versailles I suppose they are cleaning them more than a time a decade?

Can't say if they will stop us in Paris any time soon. I agree the law is crappy and mostly aimed at scooters (because people got afraid of seeing someone on a scooter on the highway mostly) but I'm quite sure that if cops are told to stop all electric vehicles, they will stop us ... We'll see how that goes.

@Pura-Vida which board do you have ? 'cause I'm considering a Lonestar for next summer and would be very happy to know if I can have a legal mode right from the remote :slight_smile:

Hi @tk463, Lacroix Nazare model, it's an amazing board, Alex is doing some upgrade to fix issues with lights and waterproof cap (power) that on first model was leaving very easily with vibration.
The remote command is a Flipsky/VX1.

Next upgrade will include backlight, Alex promise to forward it to me also in a couple of weeks.

Lonestar should be a good choice as Nazare is very heavy when you have to carry it.
Both are very powerfull and range are much more than expected and my weight is 95 kg, so i load it when I am riding!

I will notice you when a patched setting for regulation approval will be available.

From my point of view, the best thing to do is to forward your expectation about French regulation to Alex thru its website. Alex answered to my questions most of the time in less than 48 hours of delay (timezone edge effect, business/non business day)...

you seem to be French citizen, so if you want you can forward thru PM your email or phone we will exchange.

Fred alias @Pura-Vida

Private discussion with them, they will deliver a tutorial/fix soon. 
I am out of home for my job since two weeks and overloaded and far away from my board and my 6 inches mobile is my unique internet connection I prefer to spent my time off to do sports and looking for alternative or workaround.

It seems that FOCBOX will never deliver parameter switching w/o external assistance (metr) nor vx1 will never do the job. 
Vx2 connected to  FOCBOX won't permit to collect speed nor other information from vesc as enertion did not permit it by design and won't control max speed limitation.

So from my understanding:
1. I am setting erpm settings into focbox to limit to 25kph w/o metro board. And only one setting is available (as Focbox programing requires USB-C cable connection)
2. I am buying a metr pro and configure it with several profiles. And switch using my phone to one mode to another one...

It depends how LaCroix will support it, **but I will do one of this workaround with LaCroix approval only.**
