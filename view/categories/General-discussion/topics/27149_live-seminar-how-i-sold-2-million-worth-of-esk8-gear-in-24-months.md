## WHY AM I DOING THIS?

Here are the reasons I plan to give away all my secrets of success. 

1. The first reason is that I am taking my business down a different path, I will no longer be selling parts for the DIY builders of the world to make their own esk8's - let me elaborate on that further, I will be selling some stuff: FOCBOX, NANOX and a few other spare parts for Raptor customers, chargers, wheels etc. I can't stop people buying this stuff and building DIY but we won't be dedicating resources to customer support for these items if used in DIY. Our focus will be Raptor customers & The complete electric skateboard industry from now on. In summary, I really want to leave the DIY world on a positive note and hopefully what I have to say can benfit the entire community, without this community I'd have nothing.

2. Reason number two; This is also related to me leaving the DIY community, Enertion continues to get hundreds of enquires from builders who want to buy our DIY parts, which obviously we won't be selling anymore. So our plan is to refer our customers to the best vendors in this community. I want to be confident that I can recommend my customers to buy from legit vendors who are geared up to succeed and further drive this industry as enertion did over the last few years. Basically, I want the DIY industry to continue to flourish and I want the core vendors to succeed. If I can help other vendors succeed and grow the industry that would make me very happy.

3. Reason three; This is probably the most concerning part, I am tired of seeing vendors fail! Lately, there have been lots of bad deals going down and it is giving our community a bad reputation, It's really not cool! I can't easily stop people from selling on this forum and even If I could I probably wouldn't because I do believe in a free market. However, what I can do is try to help some of the up & comers develop better strategies on how to grow their business and make better products. 

**So if you need help be sure to tune in, the first 30-40mins will be all the juicy secrets, followed by 60mins of  Q&A**

P.S. Here's an early tip, Don't ask me for any money, Just because I sold $2Million doesn't mean I'm rich, I spent all the money on the business, building it up, so I can take on the big players, feel free to ask me about this during the Q&A

looking forward to it!
 
will the video be viewable after the live event has finished?

 it will be midnight here in the UK so concentration might not be at optimum levels :) So it would be awesome to be able to go over the material again later with a fresh head..

 And here on the East Coast of the USA, my dumbass sees Jason posting 15 minutes ago and thinks I figured out his #1 secret to selling $2 million worth of eSk8 product in 2 years ( The one he's not going to tell you)...

"#1.) wake up at 4:30 in the freaking morning, go to bed at midnight"

 Then I realize I just need to go back to bed, yeah he's in Australia and I  obviously went to an American public school :slight_smile: 

Great idea Jason !!  I'll be checking this out too

I've been a long-time reader of this forum, registered an account just to reply. Not that you'll miss me, or that it really matters to anyone else, but I don't BookFace. Never have, never will. I find their business methods disingenuous and I don't have one iota of trust in them. I won't register, view or participate in any activity on their platform. 

 Whereas I would have enjoyed viewing your  Webinar, the platform precludes my participation. Surely, I'm not the only person who doesn't participate in that platform. 
But thanks your your informative posts over the years, best of luck.

Haha... Sounding like an old guy there Fred! No offence.... ;)

But pretty much everything on the internet is trying to track you and steal your data... 

You have an Android or apple phone? They also track your every move. They even say your smart tv track you too...

Facebook just happens to be the best platform for this type of live content... So that's where we do it.

## UPDATE:

I'll probably talk for about 30-40mins about the key strategies... 

then i probably have around 10-15mins to talk about other stuff before questions, is there any specific things you guys want me to discuss?

I'd be very interested to learn about how you grew your business from a smaller one man operation to the full scale production it is now.

Ok, mmmm 

I think if you follow the core strategies that I will discuss you can achieve the result automatically.

of course, there are lots of details that i simply cannot discuss due to time, its 3-4 years of time & perseverance that eventually made it happen.

I'd be interested to know how someone new to this industry would find and choose manufacturers and suppliers. And what important things you're experiences have taught you from dealing with them. The whole behind the scene process going from a design or idea all the way to production and sales is kind of a mystery to me. It has been fun and interesting watching the creation and evolution of your Raptor 2, though.
