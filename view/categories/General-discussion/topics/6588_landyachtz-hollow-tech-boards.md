These look prime for an e mod.
Looks like you could peel back the fibreglass and mount cells inside the deck.
Has anyone seen one in the flesh ?

I'm not sure about using the spaces for cells, don't think it's doable because it's many small spaces instead of a few larger spaces.  

But I do have a hollow tech longboard and they are awesome, super light.
