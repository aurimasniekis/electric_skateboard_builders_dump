I have a gform pro x pads and they're great, but they're a real pain to put on/take off under long pants.
so as an alternative, what are some good knee/shin guards with articulation that'll take a fall and a slide, but go on OVER clothing and are -relatively- comfortable to walk around in?

something like this, although not this specifically
