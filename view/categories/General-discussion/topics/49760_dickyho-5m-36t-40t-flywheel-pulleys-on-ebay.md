Maybe a generic X?

![Photo Apr 05, 1 43 21 PM|666x500](upload://lYJ0oIKUesx7OSwRtHuYdUEWDaR.jpg)

There could be some improvements though. On my sample the threaded holes where not 100% perfectly symmetrical around the axis. Quality should be improved here. After mounting them it didn't seem to have any negative impact. 
![Photo Apr 05, 1 47 10 PM|666x500](upload://2m2mhuT3P9eLaAltg1zfdwK05iV.jpg)

The inner hole is 22mm same size as a skate bearing, for my application they do not fit over TB218 trucks. I will have to either file down the trucks or machine the pulley hole larger. :confounded: So they wont fit caliber II either.

![Photo Apr 05, 2 08 39 PM|666x500](upload://wv6YdBC9h9cVtIclMSAgJkRegJq.jpg)

One other change that would be nice for use with Abec11 97mm is I would like the inner side to be 4mm to 5mm longer so that the flange on the pulley comes out past the inside of the wheel. So the belt cant touch the wheel. I suppose I can make some kind of spacer. The pulley is 17mm wide so there is a lot of space for the belt anyhow.

At first I thought it would be an issue but after mounting and doing some adjusting they where not any worse than all the other pulleys I have used, there is a little off center wobble but its slightly better than what I am currently using.

@dickyho, please do that :point_up_2: 
If you make it 24,5mm, they will fit. Usually the retainer ring fits caliber and TB trucks. So use the same diameter. But @Gromok, @lrdesigns  please confirm this

this bore is 22mm, perfectly holding a bearing,  so you could put a F608 bear inside the pulley before install on the wheel.  that will solve this problem, and the pulley will more perfectly installed.

You should add these details to your first post and ebay ad. It would make selling pulleys much easier and take out all of the guess work. 

The bearing is an interesting feature to have. I'm not sure you should remove it. Unless there are bigger bearings that can still be used with a bigger bore.

These are @dickyho's 40T pulleys on a @torqueboards TB218 hanger with 4 bearings -- 2 in the wheel and two in the pulley.  It's a @marcmt88 mount and an ABEC11 wheel.  The axle would be too short if it was 1mm shorter, but it works as-is.

They also fit even better on the Evole Supercarve GT trucks but I don't have that here handy to photograph.  In that case, the two outer bearings are 608 skate bearings and the inner two are 6900Z instead of 608

[/quote]

I mean they work on the TB218 RKP hangers.  The axle length is... umm..  almost too short.  If I took any one of the 4 speed washers out it'd be much better, but I don't want to do that.  If I got rid of the tiniest amount off the end of the hanger, it'd work, but I don't want to do that either.  I will either leave it as-is or put some speed washers on a belt sander and make them slightly thinner and it will be 100% fine

To be clear, the axle DOES go all the way to the end of the nut.  But no further, not any.  Exactly that far.  With the 4 speed washers on there.

It's really, really hard to get the pulley perfectly centered and aligned.  If you use the bearings and tighten up the pulley while on the bearings, it's easy to make it PERFECT, then you can just let it ride on the bearings, too.

Ok I got it sorted out for TB218s, 4 speed washers on the inside, 1 608 bearing in the pulley, this still leaves plenty of axel for the wheel nut. I don’t want to run it right at the edge of the nut that’s too risky for my liking. With one bearing it still runs nice and true. And there is enough space to not have the belt touch the wheel. :grinning:

You do need to file the truck down some though.

Good decision. I found that temporarily installing a 608 bearing keeps the pulley centered while I tighten the retaining bolts. The idea of using a 10mm thick bearing means the pulley not only self-centers, but also now redistributes some of the driving forces. Nice!

what is the upside of having the bearing be connected to both the inner core of the wheel and the pulley? does it transfer more energy or is it more efficient?

Curious as to why you stock 15mm motor pulleys, but only 12mm wheel pulleys.

I own one of your 12mm wheel pulleys and it is definitely top-notch, but driving a single 6374 motor at speed in heavy traffic in SF, I feel safer on 15mm.

For motor pulleys it dosnt matter as much if you have an extra 3mm overhang. With wheel pulleys you have to love the mount back that much and some people don’t have the space. So it’s easier only to carry one sku and have it 15mm

These actually fit better on the Supercarve trucks than on the @torqueboards 218 trucks, but they work on both.  It just depends if you want reverse kingpin or double kingpin...


I would also recommend the 6900-2RS bearings instead of the 6900ZZ ones but that's what I had here.

You actually don't even need the retainer ring.  This works so well that, as long as you have some kick-ass threadlocker, the bolts don't need to pull on the pulley, just keep it from rotating in the wheel.  If the threads went all the way to the bolthead, you could turn the bolts around the other direction.... and even take the wheel on and off without messing with the pulley or belt...

Pulleys arrrived and very nicely machined they are too,thank you @dickyho

Mounting & sizing: I have 107s to mount,with bearings and pulley installed I observed a depth of 31mm fromthe pulley face to the bearing face.

My hanger options are a choice of TB 218mm hanger, or a regular Calber II hanger: that being the default esk8 hanger if there is one(Iknow...arguments).

Anyways, I did buy 2 of the 608/10ZZ  bearings as well, four would have been better, as you can definitely 2+ of them in each wheel.

My Caliber axle protrudes 37mm, theTB axle shows 47mm.

Neither hanger unsurprisingly will sink  into the pulley hole which is 22mm ID. Neither hanger will protrude the axle due to this.

So a caliber shaped hanger needs modification order to get back some of the 31mm depth of the pulley off the bearing.

My opinion would be to make the hole wider at the top,it's about 22mm deep and 22mm diameter, suggest to take the pain of modifying the TB hanger by increasing this diameter to 24mm,but only do this for the first 17mm, then for the last 5mm leave at 22mm, this will allow one of those special bearing to sit inside after the hanger giving some load bearing.

Let's not forget the wheel is already running on 2 bearings,I don't believe there is a huge reason to be so overbearing :wink:

Maybe if that was done and give the option or include a sleeve to restore the same dimensions as the current pulley i.e.metal spacer(sleeve) 1mm thick wall: 22mmX24mmX17mm

**Ps:** I used 60mm M5 bolts to get the necessary reach, not sure of the included ones but they were not long enough

just got done installing everything and doing a test ride.. way more fun at 18/36 than 15! 

still not quite fast enough as i could handle even a bit more but way better than topping out at 25.

rounding off all 4 edges on the trucks as mentioned makes it slide on nice n easy. Now i need to figure out what new size belt i need since its 2 short to run on marcs mounts and dual idlers...not even 1... and a lil too loose without any tension for long term use...

although 1 person found some new set screw and addressed it for the motor pulley i will as well... lowes had em in stock...home depot didnt... its an m4 screw... but the actual screw itself is just a hair wider than the keyway so its not like theres any major loss in thread length due to a full seating and secures very snug!

Hopefully people around the world will start to recognize that we cannot continue to pollute nature on such a large scale without having to deal with consequences. Be it by climate change, health issues due to pollution in the air/water/food, loss of usable land and water for agriculture, oceans filled with plastic. The list goes on. 

From what i here on the news i think China is becoming more conscious regarding these matters and are starting to make some changes. Hopefully this is true and other countries start to follow the trend. 

I like to believe that ESK8 is just a step in the right direction. However the amount of low cost crappy boards that are hitting the market is kinda scary because, in a few years they will be in land fills, probably still with the li-ion batteries inside. Alongside the hover boards, ebikes and e-scooters. 

Sorry for the off-topic.

agree too.  china is a big manufacture country,  and big pollution country.  but 90% of china's product are and was sell to the west..... so this is the same concept as the blood diamond.....

Yes...this is totally true. I am not blaming or pointing fingers at countries.

While there aren't strict governmental policies and strict enforcement of those policies by governments and specific agencies the problem will continue. 

Unfortunately it is a problem of supply and demand. Imagine i want to build a product that generates some pollution. If i produce it in the USA or Europe, where legislation is stricter, that product will have a higher cost due to the amount of pollution/waste that is generated and needs to be treated. If i produce it in China or India or other countries which have softer policies, the product will be cheaper. And furthermore, some countries purposefully disregard environmental policies to attract more international business. 

We are all to blame...we are all part of the problem and all part of the solution.

I have   normal 7mm high 608 bearing, and 10mm high 608 bearing,  and 14mm high 608 bearings.

The bolts pull on the alignment.  The alignment should only be from the bearings on the axle.

Also you can change wheels without disassembly, but that's less important.

Hi @dickyho I would just change the 4mm to 7mm so you can still fit one standard bearing in there and then it would be perfect!

Then just don't run the pulley bearing if you need the width. Or I think as dickho suggest you run one 10mm wide bearing that is shared between the wheel and bearing. So only 3mm extends into the pulley.

Ohh maybe I see what your saying, @dickyho what is the total width of the pulley?  And the smaller bit labeled B.

Why not bolt on + alignment pins? The Kegel wheel has 10 holes (5 pins 5 threads). There are a lot of Abec options which are bolt on and still work. I’ve got a relatively accurate model of the Kegel wheel.

The amount of filing needed on the caliber trucks to get the wheel pulley to fit is sooooo minimal.  It literally takes 5 minutes to do.  I'm not sure why people are complaining.  The idea of having integrated support bearings is a much better feature to have in my opinion.

Not complaining. Would be just great to have a second option, such as the ABEC pulleys come in different varieties. If I would use Caliber IIs TB218 or whatever life would be certainly easier. I got one of those fixed width axle stubs on my truck which are only 32 mm long. So, no support bearing / push fit would work, ever. Just the good old bolt-on ....

So, how difficult can it be to make a hybrid push-fit / bolt-on pulley? Can't be that hard????

Nobody uses 10 bolts on a Kegel pulley (typically 5), so why not using the other free holes for centering? I agree that the current bolt on solutions alone are tricky for a near wobble free alignment hence the extra pins similar to what Kuglis implemented 👇

The idea is not as much to use the pins for alignment of bolts.  ***The idea is being able to not use the bolts at all.***  But they can also help for aligning the bolts, though the bearings do a much better job of that.

Most "15mm" pulleys are 16mm wide and most "12mm" pulleys are 13mm wide, et cetera.  The @dickyho pullies have an extra millimeter compared to most, so the pulley for a 15mm belt is 17mm wide for 1mm clearance on each side of the belt. So technically they are 17mm pulleys.

If you really want maximum clearance for different setups I would remove the area in red with a 45deg shamfer. And personally I would like to have some more bearing area in blue to have two bearings in there if desired.

22mm is perfect for bearings.  In about 2 minutes you can do this on TB218 truck hangers

Good idea, thanks.  since there's no existing thick F608 bearings on the market. I checked with bearing factory of this today. turn out to need make new mold for this bearing, and need big quantity.

Hi.  I just measured,  my 6384 motor is 80mm length. and the mount to mount space on the extended Paris truck is 156mm after installed with 12mm wheel pulleys. So, not enough space.

The 40T and 44T will sell all of them.  Make sure they are aluminum and don't use bolts :slight_smile:

Bonus for 19mm or 23mm width available but 16mm wide is mandatory (in HTD-5M)

Yes.  If I could give you a tip I have learned

The kegel core has 10 holes which means they are 36 degrees apart

If you make only 4 bolts -- and you make them 37 + 37 = 74 degrees apart (on each side)

Then they fit very tight and do not slip when you brake and accelerate, because they are 1 extra degree too far apart

Otherwise, use all ten holes and make them 36 degrees

Thanks for tips!  this is a issue I am thinking now, to produce many of them,  need to have allowance. if only for 1 or 2, I can make it very good fit.

I was going to make it with 5 insert poles.

I think what @b264 was saying about no bolts is something like this where posts are directly machined into the pulley. 

![image|396x261](upload://1ixIPNptuDDA9E0QdnrLEQu4hbI.jpeg) 

This is obviously nicer and more convenient for the user. But it will for sure be more expensive then doing bolts.  Pressed in dowel pins might be another way that is cheaper than machined post but similar cost to bolts?

If machined post only add an additional $5 to the final price it would be worth it. But if they add $25 maybe not as one of the main advantages of your pulleys is low cost.

This way is much nicer. but need to CNC machine out the whole thing, or 1 CNC part with pins+1 machine turning part. both would add cost 15us+.   becasue the pins are thin easy to break, so need to drill slower when machining.

I will try to find something to make the pins more nicer.

I think making it with 5 bolts would be ok.   How about make one when 32T.   Kegel 80mm will need 32T pulley. 36t is too large for 80mm wheels.

Yes.  You can always increase motor pulley but you can't really make it smaller than 15 tooth.

So bigger wheel pulleys are usually better.  Unless they are physically too large (too close to ground) on small wheels like 80mm

Great, very interested in your kegel pulleys. 
Currently i use 36T but would mount 38T or 40T if they will be available. 

If your kegel pulleys wont use bolts does this mean they will have a bearing? Will it fit on a standard unmodified Caliber trucks?

There should always be an option for a bearing. If you have short axles you probably have to run no bearing. It used to be a big problem but now there are more options for trucks with longer axles.

But I think 1cm clearance will be ok.  Not many ppl used 80mm wheels so you market for 32t kelgel pulleys will be very limited.   Most ppl used 85mm to 97mm wheels on electric skateboard.  I personally likes small wheels  and use  80mm, 83mm and 90mm.

1x 40T 17mm kegel pulley

....and belts :) 

What belt size would you recommend when using this pulleys and your caliber motor mount?

Yeah Dicky, set screws matter little if you don't mind loctite. I don't use a screw or key on any of my mounts, they are all loctite'd in.

Keys are the best, and matter a lot.  When I hit the brakes, I want to know a piece of solid metal is stopping me, not some glue or shit that might slip and launch me into this intersection.
