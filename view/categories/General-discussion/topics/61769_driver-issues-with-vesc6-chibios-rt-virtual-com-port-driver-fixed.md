If you find your self having problems with drivers not being installed on your Windows based computer and get an error with this driver: Chibios/RT Virtual Com Port Driver, try heading over to Impulse RCs website and download their driver fixer for Flight Controllers. I just got the error on my PC and have had to use that before to fix drivers for flight controllers. Worked like a charm. https://impulserc.com/pages/downloads!![3J~G9A%25%5BRECRWR0EMH%7D4M9Y|689x380](upload://rpKz8hifij1m7cwveZkY5Q5kf9h.png)
