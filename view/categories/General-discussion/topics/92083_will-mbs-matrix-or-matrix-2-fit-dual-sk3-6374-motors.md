Hey everyone.  Just as the title is asking, do any of you know if the MBS Matrix trucks will fit two Sk3 6374 motors?  I currently have the motors and TB 218s, but the TB 218s do not allow both motors to sit side by side.  I've been looking at the MBS trucks along with the Janux motor mounts, but I just don't want to fork out the funds if it still won't work.  Please and thank you.

Yes they should fit on the matrix. There's about 12 inches of hanger space, more than the 218's.

I'm happy to hear that (and disappointed).  Part of me was hoping to hear "there's not possible way, sorry", saving me from forking out the dough for them, thanks man ;).  Last question.  Have you ever seen someone put those trucks and motors on a Landyachtz Evo Falcon?  I usually try and mount the motors under the board, but now wondering if the clearance is there to do so.

The MBS Matrix are channel trucks, meaning they should be mounted at a 25-35 degree angle. The EVO doesn't have the correct geometry but you could make it work with angled risers. Honestly it would be much easier to use a regular skate truck if your deck of choice is the Evo.

I would have thought 6374's would fit on the TB 218's but I think the sk3 are a bit longer than other 6374's. Have you considered dual diagonal or mounting one forwards and one backwards on the rear hanger to fit both?

I did. So I actually tried dual diagonal but was getting a ton of torque steer. The advise I got on it was to switch to Caliber 2s. The thought was shorter trucks would lessen the torque steer. Then I thought if I was considering buying new trucks and mounts, I'd go this way.
