Why do sellers fail to mention crucial details about items they’re selling. 

A few examples of items I’ve purchased and feel like I’ve been screwed over by the seller 

Mbs trucks advertised as nearly new but never mentioned about oversized holes drilled on base plates.   

Firefly remote advertised as new.    But shit cuts out n doesn’t work properly with sticky buttons left and right. 

Near new Landyachtz evo diy board with carvon drive!!   To find out carvon drive is fucked up and it took months to have it serviced just to find out shit is still messed up and almost 4 months later I’m still waiting on parts from seller to get the board running. Wth!?   Oh yeah.  I have to keep asking about them and if I’m lucky I’ll get an answer weeks later 🤷🏻‍♂️

Bkb motors nearly new at a reasonable price? To find out one of the shafts have been cut and now it’s too short to work with my motor mount.   Hit buyer up n his answer.   I’ve alre spent the money!!   Damn 

I’m I the only one with bad luck here?   Has anyone else had any experience with this sort of bs?    

I’m just curious

I got boned hard once with some wobbly wheels but I've not bought much second hand to be fair. 

Everyone has different ways to measure wear though, I think thats the main issue with smaller faults. We all perceive used items at different levels of wear.

Some advice for those looking to build on a budget 

Always ask as many questions as possible and NEVER send money through PayPal as friends and family

[/quote]

This^ exactly. Most of us learn these lessons the hard way, it’s unfortunate but true. That’s why here we preach avoidance of F&F PayPal whenever possible. It’s worth the extra 3% in business transactions just in case that “brand new” item that you’re purchasing turns out to be a whole different situation.

This is exactly my issue with people selling things "like new" or "new never used" at near new prices. 
When you buy from a vendor it comes with some level of warranty that you're receiving a working part. If you buy from Joe Schmo he doesn't have more to replace the broken ones you receive.

Yes. Two same-side bindings. Trampa doesn't have spare pads of that side and only sells bindings in pairs. Sigh. 

The price for the board + bindings was super dope though!

I really was lucky then
Maybe it's because I ask so much questions, and ask for pictures ! More than the one provided often
But I'll watch out for the PayPal thing, I admit I mostly used the friend stuff
But because this is a forum, and the guy is quite active I can find him easily in case of troubles

It’s a hit or miss.  I’ve only Been disappointed 25% of the time.    The other 75% has been legit transactions 

It just suxs that sometimes sellers fail to mention little things that can affect the transition!    obviously this is depending on buyers perspective    What might be ok or not a big deal to some might not be the case for others.

Only bad experience was when I purchased an "unused" anti spark sure it looked new but it never worked and I tested it months after the purchase. I ended up buying a mini sparky to replace it and that broke too but at least I bought that one new and they did replace it. 

That sucks man I guess we must stay vigilant with used items. Btw I had a Firefly remote and to be fair they are all a bit unreliable.

I usually make a video in good lighting showing every angle so they can judge for themselves. If there are motors and esc involved, one should show them working in the video. They can hear the sound and see it working and be a better judge themselves.

Many of us do use common sense and understanding the concept of “good working condition” and try our best to describe the items being sold as best as we can!   

Thank you all for doing that.  

As I’ve stated earlier.   Not every purchase that I have made here has been a bad experience.  Most of them have been positive and I’ve been able to score many great deals.   

I guess we just need to move on and let what bother us behind in the past.     
Keep on riding my brothers 👌🏼

Funny, for the most part I’ve had only good things to say about the used items I’ve bought off this forum. But I do always ask tons of questions and always try not to use f and f. I even had a package come opened in the mail with the mount completely missing once. The packaging wasn’t great, but the seller didn’t have to do anything about it. The gent shot me a full refund. Good people on this forum for the most part.

It's worth checking people's history on the forum before buying from them. I have never met any forum members in person, but there's still a bunch of people who I wouldn't hesitate to purchase anything from.

Also, it's good to have realistic expectations when buying used stuff. It's just more likely something will break than if you buy new. That may not necessarily be seller's fault or bad intention.

The falcon I bought from @brenternet, as he mentioned, had a few glitches. For example, the BMS died after the first charge. He also forgot to include the remote. :) But hey, these are minor things. Most things were as described and it's not feasible to mention every single potential problem. It was still a great deal. Very happy with the purchase.

Sold a quite a few ££ worth of boards and parts and spent a fair bit too. Not had any problems apart from one, some enertion clone mounts that never arrived. I always check profile to see what users have sold and also if they have been active. Goods and services payments too, although I think you only really learn that one after been stung once.

You’re not the only one! I got ripped off buying used VESC - was told it was never used. It arrived clearly heavily used and with the wrong capacitors (unattached).

Maybe we should stickie a buyer’s guide? We try to monitor group buys but it harder to manage 1:1 sales because the transaction happens outside of the Forum.

It all depends on the type of human you are dealing with. Sad to say there are a bunch of not so transparent sellers lurking here.

People gauge "like new" very differently. If I sell something like new, it's practically new. But I've been burned many times because sellers thinks that he/she just bought it two days ago and dropped it from three floors up and it's all dented but two DAYS old is pretty new right?

Wow, you have had a lot of bad luck. Currently I cannot complain about second-hand items :slight_smile:  Only my secret santa gift was once lost.

The only thing I can recommend is to pay with PayPal and pay that business fee off 3%.

Sometimes I pay with F&F but that is only for active and trustfull guys here on the forum.

I've bought a few items, here and there ;) and overall, the experience has been very positive.  

Not perfect; one of us tried, and failed, to take my payment without delivering product.  Blocked my number after apologizing that his life had fallen apart and he had filed for bankruptcy.  Refund appeared within two hours of a detective calling his wife at their home.

Another much smaller purchase recently shipped after a couple of months of non-communcation, yet that matter was happily resolved by another forumer.  Nothing bad there, just... non-communication lol.

If I had any true complaint, I've bought a couple of drivetrains here that were not-so-obviously in accidents (twisted hangers and bent mounts).

All that being said, I've made a few true friends via trading after buying a lot of stuff from our fam.  Worth it.  I think this is a good place to trade, better than Facebook or Craigslist.

I purchased a set of used motor mount from a seller. I received the mounts and found out that the mount thickness was 12mm but the seller filled a 8+ mm hole on the mount. I complained to the seller and he offered a refund.  I did not take the refund because it did not care.  .  I don't dare to used that mount.

Sold the truck and motor on eBay, then next thing you know it, I have a dispute on my behalf. The previous owner of that liftboard took the inner components of the motor. I obviously refunded the buyer of the motor, but god; how stupid could I be?
