Let’s get this going, everyone put their ages in the reply’s.  I’m pretty sure I might be the youngest builder on here. Maybe @nix is a little younger tho?

I’ll start:
I’m 13

Dang I didn't realise we had so many <20-year-olds on here! Never would have guessed @GrecoMan was so young either, fooled me. Good job not being being a typical highly-annoying 13-yo :P :thumbsup: 

22 myself, working full time in IT as a programmer/website fixer dude. Still living with my parents and siblings so I can afford a few expensive luxuries such as an Audi A3 convertible. Guess I like to brag about that one :P Still never have enough money for esk8 though :grin:

Parents and saving. I've put a lot of money into my board, and every setback is huge by comparison. $100 for a VESC is no laughing matter when that's more money than you make in a month

My parents agreed to fund this board to a certain extent but it's gone so far over budget it's ridiculous. I'm lucky they supported me as far as they did but I'm paying for my mistakes. It's unbelievably frustrating if I burn a VESC and I know it's gonna be months before I can ride again. Last time I had a successful ride was early June, but it should be good to go again this weekend.

I think the main difference between the younger and older builders are the quality of parts, dedication of builds and the relevance you give to knowledge.

While younger builders try to build the cheapest eboard, as they don't have any source of income,  older/wiser builders try to make the most reliable one, learn every single detail of the build and learn as much as they can, cost is not an issue unless the part is not worth it, safety is the number one priority.

However all of us enjoy riding with the same passion, that's why we gather here everyday!

BTW I'm 42 and enjoying eboarding more than ever!

I think it very much depends on the person - while my builds have been cheaper than some, I took the time to find quality vendors and get good parts that I need. A 16 year old spending $300 for psychotillers hubs is not practical. However a 16 year old running a cheap eBay ESC and 4s lipo isn't going to run for long. I think the middle ground is where it's best, regardless of age, because it keeps you looking and being aware of how much value you actually get out of your parts. 600$ for two of the VESC6?? Ha! Who on earth??? Not worth it. One could spend less by developing their own VESC (which I know has been done on this forum). But buying a perfectly good used FOCboxs might be the way to go.

34 Bachelors in CS
Make virtual things like web UIs or mobile apps or whatever as long as it involves pushing bits around for money.

Started skating cause of cool kids in my dorm at Purdue, got some friends back home interested enough in it to build a 12ft box with a rail on the side for practice.  Didn't really come naturally, have become more comfortable, but have been on and off with skateboarding since then.

Started delving deeper into hardware hobbies I think about 2 years ago now (it was all a blur between the 3d printer, quadcopter building, and eskateboard building).

Arduino was the first thing that got me into writing code for hardware, have messed with kinects (for 3d scanning), every kind of sensor you can think of or get for under $100: light, heat, ultrasound, infrared, hall effect, built an [FTIR multitouch](http://wiki.nuigroup.com/FTIR) table in my parents basement about 6 months before everyone had multitouch devices that fit in your pocket (saw a talk about them on TED and was too intrigued not to try to build it, was fun and worked but Apple and Google do it better :) ).

I won a giveaway for a board. I sold that board for $420.

Then while i was in NYC, some guy had a spare Raptor 1 deck, space cell 10s3p, and fastcharger, that he gave it to me for free. Sold that for $450, as i didnt really have the means to build off of that as the space cell was broken, so decided id start from scratch.

Then built a board, resold it for $100 more than i built it, on craigslist.


Now i preordered a Pulse Echo, and have about $600 left to spend on whatever i want, since i got the Echo for a super low price


Thats how i can afford a board

I kind of disagree here..Pneumatics are going to cost in the $250+ range anyway for anything usable. Then add in shipping and more times than not you end up spending more anyway. Then, factor in my replacement tires. $60 for Tires and tubes. You finding a better deal than that anywhere? 

It baffles me that any other options seem cheaper to anyone. Maybe it's the age talking...

I got skike hubs, tubes, and tires for 85$ and they work fine for my needs. If the hubs break for any reason, it’s a 3D-printable fix at this point.

They’re 15 according to the skike website... and I got them for free with the set that I bought. Won’t have to replace those for a while. I’m not going’s to continue going back and forth here - the bottom line is that for me the cheap skike system is a better fit at the moment simple because of the price. Your hubs are a level awesome that I hope to afford once I am out of college with a decent job.

I like designing and building them moreso than riding them, though the reward for a well built machine is really fun.

Interestingly what I notice here is that a lot of "kids" have access to much better machinery (CNC machines, etc) through their schools than I do, so even though they might not be as well financed they certainly have an advantage in access to resources.

I am 34. Built my first eboard about 4 years ago. Skated a bit in my teens, longboard since 20 or so. Snowboard since 13 or 14. 
All these young guys building their own boards before their even done high school, that is awesome. With that level of competency and enthusiasm coming up, combined with the level of progression over the past few years in eboard tech, I am really looking forward to how things evolve in the next few years. :) Exciting stuff.

*or 139,368 hours*
*or 8,362,080 minutes*
*or 501,724,800 seconds*
Old as of this post. I'm just starting my first build and somehow crammed what I think is most of the electrical information in less than a week. :sweat:
So far it's been a ton of fun, can't wait to start building along with you guys on this forum. :grin:

about to turn 19 got started with spending my life savings on a meepo v2p in september of last year, 

now random info: now I beat it up a lot and I am left without a board and the minimal power, torque, SUCH SHORT RANGE, and speed the meepo gave me. I really miss using my board right now so I decided to join and learn how to make my own much better board, gonna start delivering food on my bike and slowly (hopefully faster than minimum wage) earn enough to make a board with insane range which I will never need another board to which I can then deliver food on that and make money while riding a fun ass board. :) hopefully I dont get addicted to making boards otherwise I will always be broke. Hopefully this community grows, wish there were group rides in my area that I knew of, lots of people in my college use electric boards, the numbers grow more and more everyday, I should start a group in my school.

19 y/o broke life out here fam

I feel you, my board is on the bench right now for upgrades and I only have my wowgo to ride and the range is abysmal plus it takes a few milliseconds to register a change in throttle position so it's not as smooth to ride.

Good luck
