I'm trying to separate this off from the [Freebies...in Progress [OFFERS ONLY]](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/freebies-in-progress-offers-only/42391) thread because that is becoming more of a "Does anyone have this or that?" thread. The freebie thread is intended for offering things we are willing to donate to other builders as long as they pay for just the shipping.

Anyways. Post your requests here, add location and maybe your budget and hopefully someone will have something for you.

**Here are some of the recent requests from the other thread:**

@Ebisane9 "anyone have some 340-htd5-12mm belts? I have 320 i’m willing to swap"

@accrobrandon "anyone got a meepo style hub they wanna get rid of? preferably red but u know…beggars cant be choosers =)"

@Acido "anyone got some cuntersink colored washers to trade for some bt modules?"

@chsknight "Anyone have an extra keyway they can part with? I lost the one that came with an ollin 5065
I'll pay shipping"

@Wilsonliang777 "Before I buy i would want to try asking ppl here first. I am looking for a hub motor trucks. I have a set of maytech 90mm x50mm hub motors and last night I noticed my truck got bent. I know Chinese sits sell them for around $25. Before I buy it i was wondering if anyone have one of these trucks laying around and don’t need it. I will gladly pay shipping and small fee for this."

@MannyM0E No “canbus” cable. But I do have like 100 of these single ones. Soldering together two inner wires and taking out two outer wires makes the canbus cable you need. I can send you 2,4 or 6 pieces. Let me know 

Not sure what a small padded envelope cost to ship. Imagine it’s under $3 in the conus?

Anyone have a used cheap set of caliper truck motor mounts?
The motors on my Riptide r1 have started to grind against each other.
I believe it's a combination of the truck bending and the engine mounts.
I have an extra set of caliber trucks, but the mounts I currently have are intended for my hummie deck and would be far too long to fit this setup.
I'll probably jyst pick up a set from Bkb. Was hopping dickyho would have his cal mounts done by now.

3x XT60 connectors

I'll throw in a couple more dollars if you can get me a few feet of 10 gauge wire and heatshrink that would be fantastic. No worries if I need to find this myself.

Oh I did try a Trampa setup, but it was not for me.... Currently have one of Hummies decks with another of the newer ones on the way.  Also got 100mm Boas, TB 218, dual ESCape's with dual enclosure, NESE Modules for 12s4p, Firefly remote from @SeeTheBridges, a DieBieBMS from @Samau18, and @Wajdi new control panel.

Aha, I’ll explain. So I have a 24v power supply, I then connect that to a boost converter, which increases my voltage upto 50.4v. (The converter needs to be cc/cv, google lithium charging for more info) then I connect the boost converter to a watt meter that tells me voltage, amps, Wh and some other random stuff. Finally that is plugged into the board to charge

Let me do some math on how much the rims and trucks cost me (I bought a bunch or parts from them at one time) u would need to buy 1 tire but I have a brand new inner tube I can throw in, the trucks I used once and for roughly 4 miles before I got that blow out

I can take the electronics off but i should be able to work with ur budget and possibly throw the whole motor mounts pullies and belts in

While in shipping, @pixelsilva, i can have Elon Musk, sent it for me, since hes an alien too :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:



In all seriousness i changed my location to see if there is anyone willing to help

yes you are, you asked questions that were answered in my initial post.

No button, just find a latching on/off button and solder the four wires (two are for on/off, two are for button LED)

I ordered my first set from there and ordered 2 different sizes thinking one would be correct nope.  Called them up explained the situation they said I could ship them back but I would pay shipping + a 30% restock charge and then pay to have them shipped to me so I would end up loosing double the money then the belt is worth.  Nope never ordering from them.

Honestly it sounds kinda fair to me, you did order the wrong belt so you can't really expect them to lose out on shipping fees. Imagine the amount they would lose if they did that every time someone ordered the wrong stuff

Vbelts don't have free shipping right? So they lose nothing besides time responding to email and opening the return and putting it back on the shelf...which is their 30% restocking fee

I ordered from them because someone here had said they ordered the wrong thing and they just had to send the old ones back and they got the belts sent out at no extra charge. I’m would have no issue with sending it back and paying for that but 30% restocking feel to take it and put it on a shelf

Yep. Where I work. If the customer orders the wrong product and returns it. We still have to charge shipping considering the cost of shipping sometimes will equal more than the product when shipped twice. We would be losing every single day.

Some of the belts from the suppliers I have used are cut to width when ordered so not necessary a question of taking them off a shelf. And when putting them back on the shelf they can't be un cut back onto the stock material! This may not be the case here but always possible.

I might make a light cruiser for school until the E-Elpis II project is finished (months away still) if can get parts. I’m hoping to make it under 12lbs (its 6lbs as a push board) with a top speed of 15mph and range of 5mi on flat ground. I still need…

* 6s battery (I will literally take a box of half dead loose li-ion or lipo cells)
* motor (150 to 200 watts at 22 volts and 100 to 200 kv, but anything will do)
* mount for 60mm wheel (I will glue a motor pulley to a PU wheel if the kv is close enough)
* remote (I don’t care if its a servo tester on a really long wire)
* griptape (scraps and cuttoffs if they still stick and have texture)

I will accept ‘broken’ parts if they are fixable for cheap

Only continental US because shipping…I’m hoping to get it running for like $50 total, my bank is empty from buying nice stuff for the longboard

Will pay only if I can get enough offer for parts to justify the build

6s battery (I will literally take a box of half dead loose li-ion or lipo cells)
[/quote]

6S battery is great, but old loose cells won't work.  You'll probably need a single 6S lipo or two 3S lipo or three 2S lipo.  Get at least 60C and if you want a 5mi range on flat ground, you need somewhere around (I didn't use the calculator) at least 4000mAh but more is always better.

If you go 10S you can use at least 2500mAh.

If there are any hills you might need more ampere-hours.

Your budget of $50 is unreasonable, as an unpowered board costs significantly more than that unless you find it used.  Have you considered just using an unpowered skate?

I've got a Flux Drive 6374 190-195kv with refurbished can I can let go for $50. It has a nice little harmonic whine at maybe 10mph but it stops as soon as you give it more power. It in no way effects the performance of the motor. Sensored as well. Had it on a 8s system and was running 23-26mph.

If I'm using a 6s pack all I need is 10A (a 5c lipo or a 2p run of the mill 18650 can do 15A) to get the watts I need to get it going, based on bike performance calculators I will get 12-15mph with 200W and at an average 12Wh/mi I need a 3000mah battery to go 5 miles.  If the kv is 120 then I can direct drive the wheel from the outside.  The plan is to use it more as an assisted push board than an electric board so it just needs to overcome drag and friction.  I know it's dangerous to use old cells but as long as the chemistry and internal resistance match I can get some use out of them by using a balance charger.  It's a bad idea to use it long term but nobody else is gonna get much use out of that kind of stuff anyways.  If I can't make it on a budget then that's fine but it's worth a shot

I've sent stuff that made it, and stuff that didn't make it.

If I could offer tips on sending stuff in a stamped envelope -- tape the stuff to the inside of the envelope so it doesn't move around.  One piece of tape over the top is fine.  Put it on one end or the other, in the middle.  Then on the outside of the envelope, put packing tape on both sides right over the bump.

That way it won't rip through the side in the machinery.  Be light about the amount of tape and packaging you use, but three well-placed pieces of tape (one piece of office tape and two short pieces of packing tape) make sure it arrives safe and sound, all for only a stamp

What size pitch in the 5 pin hall connector?
I got you covered on the mt60s and the 3.5mm females. I can barely sneak them in the corner of your buddies package if that works.

Just to be clear you mean these as female correct?

Not sure the pitch, its for the DIYEskate ESCs

Yes those are the right ones, motors and ESC have different plugs so one has to change

If you can toss them in that would be wonderful, how much you want for them?

Don't worry about it man, it's already coming your way and shipping would have been most of the cost. Happy to help. Don't have any of the 5 pin hall sensor cables unfortunately.

You sure it's 4mm and not 5mm you need? I don't see 4 commonly used but I'm also unfamiliar with your setup

According to the eBay description the ESC has 4mm female bullets and according to the seller the motors I'm getting have 3.5mm male bullets.  Ideally I'd swap the motor bullets for 4mm male but beggars can't be choosers

Also you're the best! <3

Does anybody have a PPM cable they can part with? I pay shipping of course. I specifically need one that is compatible between the mini 2.4GHz remote's receiver and the Flipsky FSESC6.6. Flipsky sells one that I assume is compatible with their products, and it has a 2mm 3pin JST-PH connector on one end, and something called a 2.54mm Dupont female jumper on the other end. It's pretty cheap on their site, the only problem is that shipping to the US is $10-$20... 

Also, if anyone has 12mm 5M belts that are around 270mm long, I could really use those too. But the ppm cable is my first priority. 

Alternatively, if anyone can recommend a vendor/shop that sells a PPM cable that is compatible with my FSESC6.6 and ships from the US, I would really love that too. BKB is sold out for now, so that's not an option either. 

Thanks in advance everyone!

Below, I'll link the products I was referring to.

It's only the cheap chinesium ESCs that are set to a certain way and can't do anything else.

Yes.   modifying flywheel pulley to fit kegel would be a cool idea but it's not possible because the holes does not fit.  Flywheel pulley has 6 holes and kegel has 5 wheels. No matter how I try I could not find spaces to drill 5 new holes on to the flywheel pulley.

Any chain or corporate-owned place, don't even waste your time going there.

I'm talking about the kind of place that still uses pencil and paper to complete every sale (no barcodes or computers or cash registers) and some of the shit for sale looks like it was made in 1875

Here in SF I go to Cole Hardware. Is family owned with stores in major neighborhoods and is very old like that one @b264 mentioned in St Louis. This one has a complete Metric section. I recently found some stiff M5 black Nylon washers that I positioned over @moon's carbon I-Things slots because the black steel - internal hex socket head cap screws I used came out with narrow heads which weakened the I-Things slot opening.

Does anyone have some extra scrap pieces of red griptape? Enough to make a couple 3-4" circles? I'm working on a custom griptape design for my Spud, and this is last bit that I need. I'm based in the US.
Thanks!

TLDR: 
- 2x speed rings / washers
- Some male/female bullet connectors for 10awg
- Some ring connectors for 20awg that will fit over M5 bolts
- Based in Southwest UK.

Random little things, but I figured I'd ask here before I spend even more money on this build lol, as they're pretty common items but I only need a few so hardly seems worth an amazon/ebay order.

For some reason, either because they were accidentally not included in the bag or because I've managed to lose them somewhere, I'm missing exactly 2 speed rings. I have all the bolts and nuts and grubs et al, but am short two washers. 

Not the end of the world, I can buy sets of them for next to nothing, but if someone in the UK (I'm in the southwest) happened to have some going spare I figured this was the easiest thing to ask for haha. 

(especially when all the other things I needed were a dual VESC and a 10s BMS haha. I have all my parts now though... just not those two little washers! and some assorted wiring connectors.)

If anyone in the US has a 310mm belt, hit me up!  As long as it’s in decent condition, preferably 15mm wide but down to 9mm is still cool.  I’m thinking a couple bucks for a single belt and a couple more to ship it?

Running 13:36 with 90mm center to center and single idler, maybe 315mm will still work?
