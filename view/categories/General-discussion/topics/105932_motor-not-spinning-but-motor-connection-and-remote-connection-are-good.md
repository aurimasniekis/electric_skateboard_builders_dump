Hi guys, I made a diy eboard and I checked the motor detection, it passed and i checked to see if the vesc is detecting the throttle from the remote, which it is doing. But the motor won't spin, it was spinning a couple seconds before so I don't know why it stopped. Could it be cause of low battery charge and the cutoff voltage settting?? Any help would be appreciated.
