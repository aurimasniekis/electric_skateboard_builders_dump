Of the top end boards (e.g. Bajaboard, Lacroix, Kaly NYC,  trampa) is there one that's really considered the best? If money was no consideration.

Of those, yep. Kaly NYC. But that's just personal preference just like anything else. ;)

Ask @longhairedboy how he feels about nvg... lol. The real record is on a stooge board, just need to get guinuss to make it official.

This motors might be able to peak 8kw, but not for any real time. High kv hub motors like that are too inefficient for most use cases. If you can ride it on a highway, that‚Äôs great. But seeing as that is super illegal and dangerous, and you run super inefficient while riding under 50 mph, which will be 99% of the time, they lose most practicality.

We also know how carbon fiber feels with vibrations and durability... it‚Äôs like these guys have never ridden other electric skateboards or something... evolve gets away with it cause they use pnuematics.

Honestly..
The best board is the one that works for you and suits your need...
There isn't a best overall board.
Thats why I have 6 boards, most of them I build myself..


They are all great boards but they all have their faults

Example:

Kaly's great but I won't take it offroading with battery on the bottom.

Baja will eat up the any terrain but good luck using that monster of a board for your daily drive.

If you don't like bindings trampa's prebuild probably isn't for you as its really hard to ride a concaveless deck without bindings.  

They are also all too heavy for me, I really don't need that much battery for my daily rider and it actually impacts the feel of the ride.  There really isn't a "BEST" board.. figure out what you want to do and you probably can find one thats a best fit.

Yes, this. :arrow_up:  

To most people when they hear "high-end" they start picturing stuff that's so unimaginably heavy, you can't use it as a daily rider.  To me, high-end is [something that's light and fun to ride](https://forum./t/the-blue-one-12s-lifepo4-170kv-6374-caliber-2-30-43-powell-peralta-focbox/75) and ***doesn't break down***.  Even if you ride in the rain a lot.

Thanks all for the feedback! Agree the best board is the one which works the best for you. Was interested if there were any hidden pros/cons for these ¬£2k+ boards. E.g. I have an evolve GTX which I do enjoy but wasn't so aware of the sag issue. Meanwhile I then bought a small Leafboard plus which tbh I find sometimes more useful for a daily commute!
Someday I'll venture into a DIY build, when I get more time!

I have what some people would consider 2 high end boards.
One is an Evo with 2x 6374, focboxes, 12s5p 30Q, Surfrodz RKP trucks with riptide bushings, Sixshooters etc.
The other is a Trampa pre-built mountainboard with 2x 6374, Vesc6s, 12s7p 30 etc.

They have different purposes and I enjoy both of them on different terrain. For street use the Evo is a dream, however off road it takes a beating and is nowhere as capable or effective as the Trampa.

The Trampa is great for off road, it is smooth, I can jump with it etc. I also intend on lowering the gearing even more to gain more torque. I used it to commute to work today just for the fun of it.
It is heavy, slow (and lowering the gearing will make it even slower) and makes my feet hurt, something which doesn't happen off road.

What I am getting at, is what others before me already stated:

1. High end depends on the application. Something which should be fairly obvious (you never see people compare a Ferrari to a Mercedes G) but for some reason it eludes some people in esk8.
2. Personal preference plays a huge part. This is good as otherwise we would all be riding the same thing.

I should add, it could be even crazier if they went with a 12s8p hg2 pack instead of a 12s6p 30q pack. For a 4wd monster, you could get alot more performance than that board has. Change the gearing ratio once you have higher current abilities, that way the start is just as powerful but the top speed is even more moronic!

I would love to see a testing video with a sand bag thrown onto the board and let it loose on a runway.

I have 2 boards. Both trampaboard with bindings.vesc6 ESC e-toxx gearboxes,8" wheels, 12000 tattu lipo and 22000 lipo.
4x4 and 2x4.
To be honest I prefer the 2x lighter more diverse.still like the 4x4 has it's advantages to...
No change out of 10 k

You simply can't buy "the best board" off the shelf. Is there a production board like mine with a max power output of 14080 watts? Boosted by comparison puts out 2100 watts... If you want something special you ought to be either learning how to DIY, or be talking with a custom board builders like @psychotiller or @longhairedboy
