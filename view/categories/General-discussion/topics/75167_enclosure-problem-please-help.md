So close to finishing my emtb project. I just have a big problem 😢😢
It’s about 1/2” gap 
What should I do ? Was thinking thick gaskets but don’t think I could find something that thick. Also thought about even applying some sort of wedges on my board where the enclosure will sit. I’m kinda helpless atm does anyone have better idea then what I came up with ??

The battery's too tall for the enclosure

What about a little bit of silicone? :smile:
Edit: As far as I know there is even some black silicone...

You carry any enclosure that’s 1 1/2” tall and 2’ 2/16” long ?

I dont...Is that pack double stacked? A single flat row of cells is 3/4" tall. Double stack would be 1.5"

What mounts you using on those trampa trucks? Edit: dope I mean MBS trucks...🙈

I can’t see in your picture but does your enclosure come with gasket?

If you can't find a enclosure  to fit or make one yourself, and you don't care about losing Flex.
You could build up the deck by using thin slats of wood and some kind of epoxy/polyurethane sealer.... seems like more work than just making an enclosure but, it could work.

@ethel I’m using MBS matrix I I believe their called and the mounts that I have will be @Rithblu 

@Skunk yea not worry for flex since my pack is non flexi, so I maybe have to do something like that. I was thinking of putting thin strips of wood where the enclosure will sit cause a raise for the enclosure

A gasket around the enclosure may help

Like some 1/2” tall gasket. Searching eBay and Amazon right now. Could even probably double stack the gaskets if I can’t find the size I need

Wouldn't that be triple stack

Don’t think so. Once folded it’s double stack, unless I’m wrong

What deck is that one? If it's the MBS it will flex, this could be very dangerous for a non flexible battery pack. 

Please upload pictures of your battery build, but as I see it I'm very concerned

@Eboosted It’s a ebay mountain board deck that’s 10ply that’s stiff with no type of flex 
Here’s the photo of my pack setup 
Pretty much like my 10s4p setup I’m riding now just this time 12s6p 
Please give any advice 
I would love your inputs 😊

I have a hard time believing the deck has no flex at all, all mtbs have flex even the 10ply ones. Hop on the board with no electronics mounted and jump on the center, you might get a closer insight and decide if you need to rework that battery pack.


Remember you need fish paper between p-groups that's the main cause of fire

I did what you said about checking the flex in the middle and it flex’s but so very little I feel like any stiff board will have that semi little tiny flex but I think it won’t effect the pack. As for the fishpaper in each p I’ve also done that. I remember reading on a topic you said to add those fishpaper 😝
That’s what I did with my 10s4p pack

If you can record a slow motion video with your cell phone while jumping it will give you a very good idea

PLEASE be careful with those balance leads, allowing any of them to cross over will result in rubbing, which will likely lead to a short and a🔥🔥🔥
