We need to somehow pique the fancy of Elon's interest and get him to side project a simple 100K startup to create the best DIY focused *production ready* electric skateboard. Hire a couple mid tier top level engineers and drop some money in their lap to consult with us (given we can play nice! ðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜‹ðŸ˜‹ðŸ˜‰) 

And Bam. Who would buy a Tesla-esque complete with DIY focused parts (ala LHB) but from the man himself? (Or I mean, his money and vision)

Eboards could pair well with Tesla's... Imagine.

@dth2m5 is a Tesla wheel engineer. Maby partner with him. Looks an awful lot like an Inrunner. Hmm who runs those awful things, can't put my finger on it.

Ya that guy sucks. There's a lot of things Tesla does that are amazing! Ultrasonic welding is my favorite, best way to join dissimilar metals for electric contacts. So long, nickel strips! Hello copper strips! 
Hobby King does it for the graphene packs too! Super cool

From my understanding it's a very different technology from our kind of brushless motors.

They use an induction motor, so there are no permanent magnets. The coils on the outside induce a current into the inner rotor, which in response repells the coils and generates torque.

Something about it being more effecient or magnet longevity. Either way, they need a special motor driver that's more complicated than our standard 3 phase sinosoidal drivers.

Also I have yet to watch the video, so something something grain of salt

Itâ€™s not an induction motor this time.  I heard the motor described as a reluctance motor w mags in the stator to direct the field. Few magnets n just ferromagnetic rotor.  So just elec steel rotor.  Cheaper and more efficient

I think Jed Boards already did more than that; they have _full-time engineers on staff_ with the intention of treating esk8 engineering as automotive engineering ... where stuff is designed to last, last, last, and not fail under the heaviest abuse.

I'm really interested in seeing what comes out of that.

But unlike the Moments Wheels guy, they actually care about engineering quality products and not the sheer volume of PR bs they can spew.

This is why we're not hearing much about Jed.

That was an interesting video. Loads of pictures and video of the original model S, mixed in with model 3 part analysis ðŸ¤”

And yeah, I did a google and you're right about the motors. I didn't realize they changed to a permanent magnet design for the 3

Three phase. https://cleantechnica.com/2018/03/11/tesla-model-3-motor-in-depth/

I donâ€™t think it would have the power ability our outrunners have with the magnets increasing the mag field in the gap n not just directing it

Haha I loved that article. This bit killed me:

"Letâ€™s pretend for a moment that you were assigned the job of designing a new motor for the Model 3. Elon Musk has specified that your design must cost less than the Model S motor. You have also been instructed that the motor must not compromise on performance, yet it must be lighter and more efficient than its sibling. What would you do?

Youâ€™d think about applying for a job at the McDonaldâ€™s down the road from the Fremont factory. "

I like their attention to details. Not sure I like that they do their testing in flip-flops though:

How do they finance everything, pre-orders with a looooong delivery time? Their motors are just standard or is there something special about them?

They have venture capital backing.  They designed their own motors.  Not trying to derail the thread though.  But automotive engineering practices *are* being applied to esk8....

If it is a _true_ 180+amp lipo pack at around 12Ah? About $400. Otherwise I'll build it myself. And don't even **try** selling me on a liion pack. That shit is for wimps lol. @MoeStooge am I wrong?

Isnt these the multistar lipos that were more like 3c in real life?

They are not the best for certain. These are 12c @16ah.  My setup I run high discharge packs with the low discharge cheapies.  Rarely do I see over 300a running through my esc's. Discharge rates are a non issue. Wouldn't run the cheap multistar alone. But I think paralleled up would work fine.

Interesting approach moe. In smaller packs, the different discharge rates would be concerning, but with as much headroom as 32Ah, maybe all you'd need is a good balance charger..? And a lot of patience? True, that even if only 3c capable, those cells are barely breaking a sweat to do WAYY more output than necessary (or even desired lol). I like your style dude

Paralleled packs voltage act like water self leveling so amp hr doesn't matter it just adds to the total ah. Voltage is also lazy. When the multistar struggles to meet demand the high C pack will pull the weight for short periods. Not optimal but it works.

I figured that would be the way it works, thanks for that! Very clever way to build a monster-economy pack. So, what's the charging solution @MoeStooge ? Lol, at 22Ah, I charge my bricks once or twice a month. At 32ah, what like whenever you feel like it? You're a wildman Moe. Even found a use for MultiStars lol

Edit: the high-c packs are similar capacity? Definitely would love more info on that build

This setup for racing. Two 4s 16ah 12c in series and paralleled with  Two 4s 8ah 50c also in series.  These guys are 4a plug-and-play balance chargers. No buttons or settings balance port and forget it.
