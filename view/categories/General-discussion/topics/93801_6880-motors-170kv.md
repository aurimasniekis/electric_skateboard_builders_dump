If it’s for your quad 170kV should be fine. If it’s for dual I would go with 140kV. Didn’t you already order the 140kV anyway?

It goes well just a bit more slowly, but for this you could change your gearing as well in case it’s too slow for you.

You never calculate your top speed before you decide which motor kV and gearing to buy? You know there are some calculators out which give you the opportunity to do so.
