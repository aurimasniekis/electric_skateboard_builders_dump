Hey everyone!

My names **Dan** (Many people know me by my surname; **BEARE**)
I'm **30** & Live in **Southampton** (**South East England**)

I've wanted to build my own eBoard for quite a few years now & after lurking in the shadows of forums such as this one, I finally feel like I have enough time to get started! 

I will be splitting my time between eBoard building & other boring jobs such as fixing cars, looking for a new job & renovating my Bungalow! :confused: So the build process may be slow but I believe over time & after a few builds I will be able to design & build one of the best eBoards available!

For my 1st Build I would like to use a Double Kicktail Longboard & dual drive motors so that I have great maneuverability and the power to get up the many hills in my area! After that I would like to build a custom Carbon deck and incorporate many other unique ideas & tech!

**I really want eBoards to kick off here in the UK so if we can all come together via this amazing forum that would be great!** I hope that this thread can help us achieve the 1st step & get to know each other! ...our **names**, where we **live**, where we **ride** & our eboard **master plans**! :slight_smile:

gareth
london, wimbledon, near the tennis.
ride to and from work in Fulham, then ride my streets at night and weekends. want to ride more in town but no time for that atm.

master plan:
build one without killing myself.
build a reliable commuter that will manage our roads & pavements. i push best on a 2" drop deck so want to replace that.
build an awesome pintail carver for weekend fun. i like the pintail design, think it's classic boarding, and also like the flex of my Winterstick. so now have to figure out how to make it electric, so i can carve for longer and further!

and that's me ;-)

haha Nice! :D Sounds like a good plan! :nerd:

I can't wait to get my board built & I think your right about the roads here in the UK; they suck! lol

I'm sure after my 1st build I will see lots of required improvements & I bet many will relate to the ruff ride through the UK's uneven streets... I think many factors need to be considered to build a great board for the UK but i'm looking foward to it & i'm sure the UK esk8 builders are on it too! :smiley:

I live in Windsor, Berkshire, 40 and about to start building my first eboard. I have been lurking on this forum for a few months gathering information to plan my build. I was going to build a street board but I have decided to get on the mountain board train as I enjoy snowboarding and look forward to just riding over everything in my way...

Should have all the parts arriving in the next month so I'll start a build thread when everything starts to arrive.

Alright they are just cheap trucks which have 4 flat sides but I have just brought some caliber trucks to change to. I'm sure if you can get hold of a 3D file for Paris truck could help you defiantly as I could 3D print you something and you just copy and make out of metal which is what I did. Or can try and see if there is any group buys happening.

Hey!  I'm Jonny from Farnham, Surrey.

I've ridden with @Alexander a couple of times in Brighton, but I agree we all need to meet up at some point.  I ride a single motor [6S DIY Lush Machine 3D](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/lush-machine-3d-calibre-ii-trucks-80mm-kegel-wheels-alien-5065-270kv-alien-drive-system-motor-mount-hobbywing-8bl150-2x-3s-zippy-8000mah-6s-aliexpress-micro-remote-wee-dave-enclosure/8713)... but I'm now making a sort of home-brew Boosted Board, using a Flex 3 Vanguard deck with the same single 6S setup with new enclosures from @oriol360 :smiling_imp:

Hi, Doug here from sunny Ipswich.

I've just started collecting parts and hope to have my build finished after Christmas.

I have two questions for the UK crew. 

1) where do you choose to source your motors and VESC from? Are there any uk suppliers that hold stock?

2) Has anyone ever had a brush with the law? Technically your board will be illegal if over 500w. I really doubt the average bobby is clued up enough to realise but it will be something that comes to a head as they get more popular.

I have the same questions as Dougy!  Haha But maybe they should be the start of a new Topic? :)
(A cheap local VESC would be nice as I need 2!)

A couple of my friends are police officers & I can almost guarantee they wont have a clue what an eboard is if I asked them. lol

Hi Doug!

1)  Check out [AlienPowerSystem](http://alienpowersystem.com/).  They're based in Liverpool, have decent motors, really good mounts but their communication is patchy.  If stuff is in stock it gets dispatched quickly, though.

1b) [Enertion](http://www.enertionboards.com) sell the best motors in my eyes and they've just announced a brand new VESC, they have a new European warehouse that they will be shipping from soon I believe.  Their motors are 190kv so you'll need to be running at least 8S to get decent performance.

2)  No brushes with the law, I've been riding my board in Portsmouth, Brighton and locally here in Farnham with no issues.  To be honest, I rarely see any Police as they're so over-stretched these days dealing with actual crimes.  I wouldn't worry about it, I don't - but I always ride with public etiquette, meaning I won't go blasting through a group of pedestrians at 15MPH, for example, it's just not cool.  If you go slowly, you're more likely to spark a conversation about the board and people tend to either get excited about wanting one or just call you 'lazy' for riding an electric skateboard, haha!

Hope this helps! :slight_smile:

Hello fellow Brits,

Sam, 24, Essex (please don't judge me for me it)

Just recently graduated in Mech Eng and needed a project to keep me occupied whilst deciding what career I want to pursue. So what better then an e-skate! Got 90% of the parts just waiting for gearing system. Also planning on making a video of the project so it could take a while to finish everything.

Any questions feel free to ask :slight_smile:

Hi All,

I just introduced myself a little on the main intro forum but I thought Id add something here as I am indeed from the UK, Portsmouth on the South Coast in fact 

I am fairly new to Skating but I snowboard, Kitesurf, wakeboard and Paddle board so I am hoping there are some transition of skills there.
I got a conventional push power longboard last year and got to grips with it a bit with the plan of enjoying it this summer however a ligament injury kitesurfing at the beginning of the year, so my push leg/knee put pay to that.

I have been looking at boosted and the likes of those pre-made boards before and the cost has put me off. As I said in my other intro message I am keen to have several stages where by I add complexity and improve the final look down the line.

I have a few questions about our options here in the UK when buying parts etc but I will ask those in my build thread unless you think it is best here or in a separate thread.

Cheers,

Neil :wink:

Hey Neil, I'm up the A3 in Farnham :-)  If you need any pointers let me know (on here or via a message).  General points of interest for a first build include [Alien Power System](http://alienpowersystem.com/) as they are UK-based.  [UNIK](http://unikboards.com/en/) are in France and [Enertion](http://www.enertionboards.com/) should also be slightly more accessible and affordable very soon as they're gearing up their European warehouse for next year.  I'm in the process of building a home-brew single-drive Boosted Board (Loaded Vanguard deck) so I'll be up for riding Southsea next year!

Hi mrjonnyjones,

Thanks for your reply, it's been a busy few days. I got my board built and have been out for a couple near my work and it's great fun if a little scary haha. 
Thanks for the info that's the first time I've seen the UNIK stuff, it looks good. I bought most of my stuff from Alien in the end. 
Still got a way to go, I want to make a better enclosure and learn how to ride it a bit more confidently. But yeah I plan to carry onward and upward so let me know when your heading down to Southsea.

Hey strangers my name is Adam, I've been on this forum for a few months now, been into longboarding for a long time but only recently got into electric skateboards and I'm absolutely loving it. 
I'm 36 this year and although I'm not old I am enjoying not having to push or carry my board. 
My first and only introduction into electric skateboards is my pre-built Magneto (koowheel) and a play on a strangers benchwheel. 
I'm now looking to get serious and have something with better all round specs but can't warrant the cost with the wife so building is the next best option, the only issue here is that although being a professional boatbuilder in both wood and composites, I would say my weak spot is electronics. 

Keen to meet builders in person, try out their boards and bounce off ideas, inspiration and learn along the way. 
Im a hands on learner, not a textbook one. 

I live in the South West near Exeter, willing to travel for events and meet ups.

Anyway looking forward to being able to enjoy my hobby in a new way for many more lazy and exhilarating years ahead ;)

Hello guys. 

My name is Jacob Lord. 

I am brand new to long boarding and esk8ing and I am planning on making my first build in the next week or two. 

Currently a university student at the university of Lincoln and the president of the universities Airsoft club.

I live in Waddington, just on the border of Lincoln and I hope my first build can replace the bus into town!

Hey brothers, can someone help me to kick the ass of this guy @qtron ? He deliberately violates the CC license and is selling my design on eBay without even asking any permission or donation. Good thing is that he's in UK and I got his name/address, so getting this situation back to normal at the worst case will cost me a Eurostar trip from Paris.

Hi Guys - just wanted to put up a quick reminder that there is a UK eSk8 facebook group here:
https://www.facebook.com/groups/692928530874989/

If you fancied joining. Would be great to see the group more active and might provide a good source of info for UK based people. 

Also now the weather is almost good enough to get out I'm happy to report my board is almost rideable now. Mount is being welded tonight and I should be able to maiden

Hello guys,

Jerome from Aberdeen. 
Struggling to find time to work on my built, but most of the parts are in now. With the poor condition of the roads in Aberdeen, I had to go for pneumatic wheels. Board should be for commuting to work.
Owner of various electric vehicles (E-go skate, solowheel, big daddy style skate with antique SLA batteries).
When wind blows enough (and wife allows...), on the water on a kitesurf board or on land on a kite buggy or mountainboard.
I have sent a request for the Facebook group.

Hello All, im James from sunny bognor, any other sussex guys out there

looking to build a single drive long-board i'm guessing the sk3 motor is most suitable. and im looking at running on 80mm or 90mm wheels

is there any lists of uk suppliers for parts like motor mounts and drive pulley kits, seems sensible to ask before i start trying from scratch.

Hi James! :-)  I'm in Farnham, Surrey.  For parts, look at Unik Boards ( @okp ) .  They're in France but ship world-wide.  It's really the only 'local' place I can whole-heartedly recommend these days.

For mechanical parts you have Trampa of course. For electronics/drive train Alien Power System in in England. Otherwise you will find on the forum some guys based in Europe who can provide you all sort of parts with reasonable postage costs. Use the search function and the For sale section of the forum to refine your search. I am more on MTB/Pneumatic boards so I cannot really advise on longboard parts.
Good luck :wink:

Hello all,
I am from London and will be building a 8s5p board in September. Currently I am developing a new controller that will have an OLED display showing directions and other stats and a thumbwheel for throttle/ brake/ reverse. The law on eboards in the UK confuses me a lot - are they legal after the flaming hoverboard fiasco? Where do people ride their boards when commuting - cycle lane, pavement (not great in my area) or on the edge of the road (like bikes)?

Hi AJ, it could be your batteries.  You should leave batteries charged at about 40% if you're storing them or not using them for a week or more.  I run 6S Lipo (2x 3S in series) and I leave my batteries at 11.4 volts when I'm not using them.  If you're leaving them charged quite high for a long time you might damage them, or if you leave them too low (nearly fully discharged) then that can cause damage as well.  If you can supply more info about your battery setup that will help :-)

Hey guys,

From North London here and I'm about 75% through my first build. Would love to meet and learn more, especially the more technical stuff. I'm a teacher and hoping to use my board to go to and from work as well as cruising the streets whenever I don't want to ride my bicycle.

Curious to request if anyone has an STLink V2 since my current wall is not being able to connect my VESC to a BLDC tool (trying to use Ackmaniac's one). From DIY V4.12 so I thought it would come with a bootloader already but my issues are seemingly more complicated (unless there's just a driver I need to install on my windows PC...).

Look forward to getting in touch, would be great if I could solve this too.

Hey Cyril, I live in Tottenham. Would love a pair of eyes on this as I don't want to do anything that will complicate this issue. 

I've looked at some guides and I'm curious (I'd like to learn how to fix this too). Do I need this [£17 STLINK V2](http://uk.rs-online.com/web/p/processor-microcontroller-development-kits/7141701/) or [this USB part](http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/ST-Link-STLink-V2-Programmer-Debugger-STM8-STM32-Blue-Pill-latest-Firmware-UK-/262087067780?hash=item3d059b4884:g:TE0AAOSwAYtWGQqG) or both?

I'd prioritise your help with this since I don't want to mess anything up.

They are really nice on smooth and quiet. Made my board way more comfortable on rough roads, grip seems good in the dry, small contact makes them feel little slippy in the wet and not tried sliding them yet.. 

Only had one problem with them, carving and leaning into a corner after hitting some of those bump strips at a crossing i ended up being bounced off course so much i had to bail.

Also, taking them off road 'properly' drains battery big time.

Yeah saw those wheels been thinking of getting something bigger for myself i like the look of the mbs all terrain they 78a bit softer, haven't ridden any wheel that big does your board feel bit high with those wheels on?

Yeah one of my friends has just started getting some parts to build himself one, that one more so far for group ride :grin:

 And evolve wheels that my kids use. And my daily drive a custom with kick tail, single dark matter motor at 12s. 

Both decks have vac formed custom abs enclosures on custom maple decks made with the roarockit thin air press..
