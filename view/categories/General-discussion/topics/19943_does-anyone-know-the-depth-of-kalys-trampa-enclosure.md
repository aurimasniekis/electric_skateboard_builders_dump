For anyone who has @Kaly 's trampa ABS enclosure, does anyone know the interior depth of it by chance?
I want to use lipos and was wondering if any will fit in there.

(I tried DM'ing him but he's not answering :confused:)

Thanks!

Hello there
 depth is 21 mm
I will stress you do not use lipos on this deck. The flex of the deck is too much for the lipos, it will be a dangerous situation.

I'm assuming the only way I can use lipos with trampas is by keeping them on the top of the deck, not attached to the bottom.Alrighty, no biggie.

Thanks!
