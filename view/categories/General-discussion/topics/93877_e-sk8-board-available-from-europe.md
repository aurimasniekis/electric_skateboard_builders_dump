Hi all,
LaCroix, Bioboards, Torqueboards, evolve, ...

Which are the company that are doing business with realistic time to deliver ?
post by post I am improving specification of the future board that will replace the low-end board that needs half a year of prepaid gestation...
But as many European's specifications are the visible part of the process as to find a shop that sells and ship to Europe, importation taxes, DHL/ups, warranty, EU electrical plug and 220V standards are the stealth parts of the iceberg.

Question: 
which vendor are doing business, get distributors, representatives or partner in EU? 
Where, what are the extra costs, delays?
Impact on the warranty?
What are the alternative?
