Am going to get one too, fingers crossed for unity compatibility. The VX1 worked with Unity so I hope this does too. Was going to get the VESC wand because that thing looks amazing, but doesn't work with Unity. :frowning:

For $79.99 you bet Im getting 2!( for me and my gf) I have the vx1 and love it! For $20 more this is a deal. I just hope it is as comfortable as the vx1. Vx1 is super comfortable atleast compared to the nano.

So the screen doesn't function properly but it does control the board? I see you're using the UART connection, how about PPM?

I asked nicely and am possibly wanting more of these. (got a load of friends who will need controllers for their boards)
I've tried to get my focbox to recognise it but had no luck (UART)
Also connected up to PPM and just got a bad signal. I will try again without so much rum and see if I can get a better result.
I have a flipsky 6.6 dual mini I will give a go with.
Comes in a lovely box.

Its feels good, but the throttle feels a little to easy to slip, I just got a test unit so maybe they will improve it. I know the display and case will be alot better for the customers then this test remote I got.

Just checked with Flipsky, it will be a per trip mileage..
The remote/VESC won't record the lifetime mileage..
The mileage will reset after turning off the board :slight_smile:

I (with a great deal of help from Q) got it work on 1 motor. No telemetry and wouldn't share the signal to the other focbox over Can. Which is curious because it would for the mini on PPM. Could be old version firmware on the focbox?

ahhh crap! Had high hopes for this one.

It would be so good if you could make it work on focboxes! I'd upgrade to this (if working properly, with no lag or excessive  play) and put the Photon to rest.

Keep on the good work! Has Flipsky said anything about compatibility?

The pilot remote is supposedly coming from Enertion soon. Trampa wand also due to be released.
And of course there's this bad boy which looks like it may top them all.

I picked up one of these from @tomiboi 
https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/high-performance-remote-batch/100095

Got it working with unity.
Build quality seems solid, I would place it at very high quality DIY just shy of quality professionally mass produced parts

Did a few quick rides including right up to a large power transformer near my building.
Haven't experienced any dropouts yet.
Day 1 using it for commuting so far so good.
Will write a first impression followed up by one month ownership article soon.

It's good to see so much competition coming up with remotes. I might try this one out as a backup. I worry about the signal being over the comm/UART. That is a change from what we've all been safely working with since the beginning. I would need to test it.

@Ixf Thanks for the shout out :slightly_smiling_face: The tomiboi remotes are testing well with Unity. The next batch will be shipping within 2 weeks. I think you'll find it to be a whole new level of remote.

It works! 
Updated my vesc tool and updated firmware and away it went.
Telemetry seems to work and the trip works and seems to be a lifetime counter? 
No chance to road test now, been doing some loctite-ing.

It was on a pair of focboxes. I updated their firmware and redid all detections etc.
First impressions are the dead band is far too large making the throttle movement too short with a massive dead band in between the acceleration and brake.
Also the screen isn't really bright enough to be usable in the sunshine.

edit: is there no option on the remote to cut the deadband? There is one on the Photon, but in my case it does f#ck all...

I asked them about lifetime mileage under their youtube video, they told me that it doesn't support it yet, but it is possible to get this feature by modifying the code. However their code is not open source, so they need to implement it.

That means we might get this feature in updates. Try to write them as well, more people asking to have this feature, the more chance we will get it.

If you look on the few test remotes including the one I have the final version will be better: 
The sample case is done via fast silicone mould instead of injection mould, so it's not as strong and good as that of injection.
Also, the screen will be clearer.

On my remote all that it takes to switch between VESC and UNITY is to move a "//" in the code on the Arduino IDE. One remote. Two ESCs.

I'd like to inject an opinion about the OLED screens on remotes including mine. If you ride with a metr Pro or something similar, you'll forget about the OLED. You'll only use it for battery and settings, but not telemetry. It's cool... but it's not a big deal. The things left to consider after that are the quality of the build and the precision of the instrument. 

Honestly, I'd stick with their old model and use a metr Pro.

I've had a little more help with this and managed to reduce the dead-band very slightly by reducing it to 0% in the nunchuck app. (It's still really big) Also altered the throttle curve slightly to ease into the brakes and throttle to help with the uncertainty when try into anticipate the braking or acceleration.
Today if it drys up I'll be able to give it a go.

I’ve ridden today after reducing the dead band and altering the throttle curve and good news is that it is quite rideable.
I've spoken to flips and the engineers are looking at reducing the deadband on the production ones so we should be good! They are also looking at brighter screens. 
I've got a week or two now of using the board for daily surf checks so any progress or problems I'll report back.

Just got my vx2 remotes today. First impressions are its a little thick in the hand compared to the vx1. It doesn't have a nipple? Thing on the throttle and feels weird(maybe ill 3d print a custom one). I do like how much throw it has compared to the vx1 or nano for smoother acceleration and breaking. Screen seems very bright to me.

Edit: I'm 6'3" with bigger hands and it still feels alittle big for me. Just a fyi for anyone with smaller hands it maybe to big.

I’m using mine as it is on the focboxes. Telemetry seems great.  I’m getting to grips with the large deadband, not ideal but I am in control..
The screen is largely un-viewable in sunlight. 
They have told me that there is a version to come with brighter screen and smaller deadband. I’ve offered to test it when it becomes available.
