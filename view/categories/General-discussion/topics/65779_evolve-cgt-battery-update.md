Very useful tool if all the data is correct. That would of took a very long time to collect all that.

I hate to be the bearer of bad news but the Efest 35A 18650 does not provide 35A of discharge.

http://forum.e-liquid-recipes.com/t/warning-efest-3000mah-35a-now-uses-a-10a-cell/40798

It only has 10A of discharge. 

Samsung 30Q are still king!

For the time being. Statement must be reevaluated 5 years later.

As soon a the Samsung 30T drops it's price and become more available we will be seeing 10s4p of 18650s being replaced with 10s3p of 21700s. For now you can't beat the 25Rs or 30Qs cost/performance wise

And they won't drop their price because of the bloody vapers.  :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

That's WHY they will get cheaper.  Bigger numbers means cheaper

Joking I am I'm a bloody vaper.  Seriously though the single retail price for 18650 and 26650 cells went through the roof once they were recognised by the vaping industry and this in turn put up the bulk cost.
