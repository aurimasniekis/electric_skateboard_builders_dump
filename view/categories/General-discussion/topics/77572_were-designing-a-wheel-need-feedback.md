Hey all,

**Edit**: Poll Closed. Cast your additional vote and see the post here: https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/need-your-opinion-on-which-wheel-looks-best/77572/28?u=dth2m5

**Can you do me a favor?

There are entertaining (hopefully) development on grip and comfort testing videos if you go follow the sign up link above.

We just need your quick vote. We'll probably do another iteration based on what the community decides. 

We're designing a really comfortable wheel to stop feet and leg ache with 26mph+ capacity but not killing acceleration (all other parameters like gearing held equal, but not lose grip and stability). 

We'll make other colors, but just wanted to see which design or direction would be best?
