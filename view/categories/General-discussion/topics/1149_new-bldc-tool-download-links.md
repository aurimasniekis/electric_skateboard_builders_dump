Recently i have setup a website for the use of downloading of BLDC-TOOL for windows and OS X and all VESC related Firmware and files, this link will soon be a fully set up website with active download links, support documents and videos as well as offering vesc support via remote access and video call.
the new link for BLDC-TOOL updates is:

http://www.vesc.support  or
http://www.bldc-tool.support

if any one has the knowledge and wants to help me set this website up that would be great i will pay maybe in vesc!

also BLDC TOOL 2.10 is know available

check my latest updated windows version of bldc tool.

http://vesc.support

iv actually been working on the installer so know it places all files for you, instal's the correct drivers and then places a desktop icon,

OSX is know in a dmg
NEW:
if you plug in your vesc before loading bldc tool then bldc tool automatically detects the vesc and sets the correct com port while tagging that com port (vesc) so the user knows its detected. you simply just click connect. soon ill add auto connect.
there is also a refresh button that locates the vesc just incase you didn't plug it in before opening.

this is all apart of trying to reduce confusion.

I'm about 2 weeks away from finishing a bldc tool esc setup wizard that will have a single button to detect foc and bldc settings and app data to make it easy for customers with no knowledge.

please every body i need feed back on my site.

Hey @jacobbloy. I'm really struggling to download the latest BLDC tool. When I get through to the download page, and click the download button, it prompts me to enter my email address (which I do) and then sends me an email subscribing to your mailing list or whatever, and I confirm, but I never get to the download link. I then go back to the site and click it again and nothing happens...

Pretty annoyed. What is the issue?

Are there any other direct download links or anything?

Thanks.

Hey @jacobbloy - have you spoken w/ Vedder about his new VESC tool (new version of BLDC)?  Curious if you had seen it any input on next version?

Site's still down....

Awesome work and idea to help others. Latest VESC resources are intermittent and hard to keep up with. VESC is a breaking news front in the e-skate world.

I am willing to host the site for free as I have a lot of unused bandwidth on my server.  

Do you know how many TB it uses a month?

Did you read the first post of ackmaniacs BLDC tool thread? Just download BLDC Tool and his firmware 2.54. Open BLDC Tool, click on "Firmware", click "Choose...", search for the firmware "VESC_Ackmaniac_MOD_2_54.bin", click "Upload", green bar appears- ready.

The site looks like it's back down again, but in case it goes back up, it's here: http://vesc.net.au/BLDC-TOOL/

I've put some of the more recent ones up on my google drive in the time being:
