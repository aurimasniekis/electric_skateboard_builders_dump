Dont stone me!!  :-p

I know im on a diy site but i want your opinion as i would love to build an electric skateboard but for some reason the good parts i want are more expensive then buying an evolve bamboo set up. I should say i live in NZ and there is practically no where to buy parts locally so everything has to be shipped and our dollar is bad compared to the usd. I have been looking at buying all the parts from aus as our dollar is very similar and my budget would be about 1k. I have the perfect board for it minus the trucks and wheels but every time a try price up a kit it comes to about $1200 so i think i might as well buy an evolve board as its been tried and tested but i would love to do upgrades later on. Any i deas would be great! Most of the parts i would buy would be from enertion so...

Battery - http://www.enertionboards.com/electric-skateboard-parts/space-cell-pro4-electric-skateboard-battery/ $559
vesc - http://www.enertionboards.com/electric-skateboard-parts/vesc-standard/ $179
motor/truck kit - http://www.enertionboards.com/diy-electric-skateboard-kits/enertion-single-motor-mount-pro-kit/ $482
controller - http://www.enertionboards.com/electric-skateboard-parts/2-4ghz-radio-hand-controller/ $110
All up $1330 aud

evolve bamboo - https://www.evolveskateboards.com.au/collections/bamboo-series/products/bamboo-series-street-electric-skateboard?variant=772530341 
$949 aud

i got the smaller motor so i can upgrade later on and i would still need to buy other parts to do my vesc, i have had a look at hobby king and thought about putting 4 x 5000 mah batteries together but not sure if that is out of my knowledge range or not, any ideas or help to bring the cost down would be great but still keeping the quality, thanks :slight_smile:

You could use lipo batteries, that would bring the cost down heaps. They last about 250 cycles and lithium ion lasts 500 cycles.

The parts you have listed here ALL come from enertion. Enertion is awesome, but you can get a 6S 5000mah battery for $50, and you could use a 6s ESC for $60, and you could use much cheaper trucks and wheels, a $60 motor, and buy a motor mount.

There are ALOT of resources on this site for building CHEAP < $400 electric skateboards.
There are also a bunch of instructables and tutorials.

http://www.instructables.com/id/Make-Your-Own-Electric-Motorized-Longboard/?ALLSTEPS
http://www.instructables.com/id/Electric-Longboard/
http://www.instructables.com/id/DIY-Electric-Skateboard-1/

Not to mention ALL the resources on this site!

Now I also recommend that you read this article: http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/start-here-faq-for-diy-electric-skateboard-builders/215

And this one:  http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/are-diy-electric-skateboards-cheaper-the-false-economy/165

Once you have done that, you can decide truly if you want to build or buy.

Yes ive been through most of those but i dont want to build on cheap, i have only ever seen cheap builds or expensive ones, i went with that battery as its the one i would wont (or similar) to use when i get the extra cash to do dual motor set up. I dont want to go down the track and end up replacing all the parts. Unless i get good motors and vesc now and go with the cheaper batteries until i can get the slimmer ones as @lox897 has mentioned.

I was just providing some links to cheaper components. I built my first board for < $400. It's a beast. It really depends on what you are looking for. If you want the best you can get, its going to cost you. That being said, you can get a sweet setup that can go 20miles on one charge @ 30mph for the same price as you can get an evolve board. It really depends on if your willing to put the work in. The enertion battery is nice, but it is VERY expensive. You can get a 10S4P battery for $270 from some of the builders in the forum. You can also use your own motor mount system which will be much cheaper than the enertion one. I got a motor mount system for free because I put in the work and machined it myself. If you don't have access to that, you can buy a motor mount, pulleys, and belt for < $90 and get a hq motor for < $70.

You can also check us out at www.. I'm sure, you'd save a few hundred if not more.

But DIY will cost a bit more.. In the long run, you'll have a much more lasting board. From what I've heard from someone.. Evolve isn't selling their old motors anymore so if you need a replacement they are pushing you to their new builds.

DIY you can start off as a single motor setup and upgrade later on in the future to dual motor. We'll always have parts for DIY and we're here to stay.

so true. New Zealand has literally nothing available locally. My total planned cost for a mono drive came up to $1300 NZD and for my dual drive plan its like $1800. I am just deciding whether or not I should spend that much :sweat:

Currency is the same whether it's AUD or USD if I'm not mistaken? Maybe I don't understand that question. Shipping is flat rate $40 or free over $300+.

You're getting the creative experience and the feeling of accomplishment that you built it, down to soldering the connectors and how you want to mount the parts. If that doesn't mean much to you, I say just buy something and save the headaches.

Great. @Maxz thanks for the info.

Something that is $255 USD = $344 AUD

So I don't see the difference?

The price wouldn't change if it's $200 USD it's not going to be $200 AUD.. Otherwise everyone might as well just pay in AUD.

Exactly, that less than $400 board above would be closer to $600 NZD then add int. shipping! Building a cheap 6S for a friend and coming in at the $700 AUD range. Only could have been cheaper with a welded mount, but couldn't find clones cheaper with shipping than Enertion / DIY offerings.

I bought two yuneec ego a while ago. Ready to run stuff is great to get into the hobby. I love my yuneec and still drive it. You can always sell the ready to run board it on ebay if you end up not liking the experience. It should hold value better than DIY stuff.

However, if you want top value and performance, you have to go DIY.  with a bit technical aptitude you can beat almost any ready made board.

That's a good find. Would be a pretty cool board if it actually exists. No sign of it on trademe.

Sorry for the confusion but i was looking at buying the stuff in Australia cause it was most likely cheaper with shipping and currency exchange but some stuff in America is still cheaper then buying the Australian products i suppose cause there is alot more sellers. It helps alot more that you are free shipping as most things to get shipped from the US is expensive so it cuts the price way back.

Just buy a Raptor from enertion. You'll either end up spending nearly as much on a DIY build or buying a cheaper off the shelf board and wishing you'd spent more. I've ridden both mono and dual Raptors, can't go wrong with either board.

What if i went... 
Ollins 200kv motor + vesc etc = $350 nzd shipped
@torqueboards motor mechanical kit + remote + on/off power switch = $560 nzd shipped
thats $910 
and just need to find batteries
or everything above from torqueboards + vesc + 6374 motor which comes out to $867 nzd shipped then buy batteries and parts

If you're gonna go DIY don't cheap out or you WILL be disappointed.  Don't cheap out in terms of $$$ or effort.

What about charger, random connectors, tools, and enclosure? And not to mention time! You're going to go over your 1k budget at this point.

What popopopop said is true. Unless you have the tools or freinds with the tools, its hard to completely DIY a board. People be like "I made it for under $400" on instructables when they machined their mounts, welded the mount on, made fiberglass enclosures, made their own batteries and have a ton of resources around from previous projects. If you dont have a ton of tools at home, your best bet if to buy the SPACE cell and the other parts from any place like Eneretion because the SPACE cell is gonna save you a ton of work.
It comes with a charger, switch, % display and connector all nicely packed in an enclosure with room for VESC and receiver. I think it's fantastic.

Yes very true and that's why I would of gone with it. I would love to get the enertion battery and Jacob's hub motors but my wallet (and my wife) says no haha. I do have a mate that has access to all the tools I need but I don't want to drag him to his work for hours unfortunately.

Isn't that basically what he is doing already at about $1000 NZD? Also those esc's don't appear to ship to AUS let alone NZ.
