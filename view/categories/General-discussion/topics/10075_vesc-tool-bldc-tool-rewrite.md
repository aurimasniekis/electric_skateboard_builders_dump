Vedders video about the upcoming Vesc tool. It's not finished yet but I thought I would share.

the new UI looks very good, I like it!

also I guess that with cleaner code and more modularity it will be easier to add values/entries to the tables in the UI for more parameters and more configurations!

The logo in top left corner is ugly as hell.
I hope the new version will allow you to read out all parameters with onne click and save them all to a file.

So.. is there ''peak review'' version ready to be looked at?

If the new tool offers some more ''privileges'' over the existing one for vesc 4, then I would be more than willing to get vesc even sooner :)
