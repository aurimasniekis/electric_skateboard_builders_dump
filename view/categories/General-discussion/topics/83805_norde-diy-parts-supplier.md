Hi everyone!

Like each member of this community, I also wanted to build my electric skateboard, some years ago. I have read articles blogs and tutorials by and night. Now I would like to give my contribution to the community through NØRDE. 

NØRDE would provide DIY parts as a first step, but aims to gather everything you need to build and customize your board, no matter your skill level. 

For the technical parts, the headquarters are in France, but I am living in Switzerland for six months and will ship from here. 

I hope to develop and grow this project with you. Stay tuned!

**NØRDE – Power In Your Hands**

Are you making the drive train yourself or sourcing from Maytech or diyeboard?

Below are the first images of the wheel pulley for orangatang kegel. The suppliers are now on holidays and we need to wait a little bit longer for the motor mount. But they are coming :smiley:

@venom121212 Thanks! I am fascinated by the nordic countries to be honest

Seriously tho, the finish is amazing,  I thought those were renders at first.

Welcome to the forum those pulleys look very nice.  Are they the snap in style or the bolt on.  I see you are from switzerland.  I found out that my fathers side is originally from mumpf and frenckendorf.

no bearing no deal ;)

Seriously though: the trend clearly is to avoid the unnecessary bolts to hold the pulley.

Thank you everyone! My supplier surely hates me because I am too intransigent with the surface finish, but it's worth it. 
 
@Itsmedant Yes, I will do a beta testing. I thought about waiting for the motor mounts to arrive, so for the end of this month. What do you guys think?

@briman05 and @Maxid They don't use bolts. I decided to avoid the bearing, my goal is to make easy-to-install parts that do not require any modification of the wheels or something like that.

Good luck!!

The inserts are manufactured with high tolerances, and the system is held by friction. It works for me, but I am lightweight and not a heavy user. The idea for the next few weeks is to see if this system is viable and generalizable. If it is not, those pulleys will be converted to bolt pulleys, and the next batch will be bearing pulleys.

That is really good to hear I have been wanting to try out the press on pulleys but I like to use zealous bearings for the time being may be switching over to the precision bearings that have in testing right now. I have a fresh set of ollin popoca waiting for some pulleys to be put on.

@DEEIF Thanks for your suggestion. I am doing it now!

@ARetardedPillow It is true that it has been a long time, but the last message was 4 months ago :P We have set high standards for our supplier to meet, which increase the production cost. 

@Schulerbible Yeah! Of course, we take into account the suggestions made on this forum. After consideration, using no bearings and no screws won't fit any use. But it takes some time to redesign, retest and send to production. 
 
@torqueboards No worry, it is only for the pictures. I think the side with screws is quite cool. But of course, you can reverse it:

 So, for this time I am willing to sell at lost by lowering my prices. Next orders will be bigger, no worry. I have updated the first post, but here is the summary of the new prices:

- Motor mount: 50€
- Wheel pulley: 45€
- Motor pulley: 9€
- Belt: 9€
- Kit: 110€

I hope you find those prices fair. I won’t be able to go below that, unfortunately. Anyway, you won’t be disappointed.
