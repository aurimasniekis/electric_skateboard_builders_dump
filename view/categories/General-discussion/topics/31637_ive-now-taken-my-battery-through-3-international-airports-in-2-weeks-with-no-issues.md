Hi team. Just reporting my 3rd success, having now gotten through Los Angeles, Barcelona, and London Gatwick with my 10s4p. I should note that its in a 10x4 block mountainboard esque box that is completely separate from my board. Leaving LAX they asked me to explain what it was and I explained there are 40x 3.7v 1000mah (wink) lithium ion cells with 10 cells in series, 4 in parallel for a nominal capacity of 148wh. 

Looks like using 3.7v 1ah, you can fit a max of 43 cells, but theres no practical use for a block that size. 6s7p is the largest battery that makes sense for this purpose which is "155.4wh" or 388.5wh if youre using 2500mah cells.

Hopefully this eases some worried minds. Keep in mind that my battery is in a 10x4 block and as always, YMMV. 

Happy travels, folks!

I'm surprised because it looks more like a bomb than any of our battery enclosures! Lol :thumbsup:

it definitely looks like a bomb! the only reasoning I can come up with is that it looks like a wheelchair battery and not like an electric skateboard battery, which, to someone not in the know, is associated with hoverboards and the bans surrounding them.

148 Wh is under the IATA accepted capacity of 160 Wh for a single battery. Not sure the purpose of the battery is any relevant.
You see a lot of details in the X-rays machine... :wink:

Ah! right!...you "forgot" to mention that minor point :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
I was surprised with the relatively small size of the battery.
Not sure they can actually control that if they do not have access to the writing on the battery

If everyone starts grossly understating battery pack size, they're just going to ban them outright

A better option is to have your battery break down into multiple <99Wh packs and put them in your carry-on. Or two <160Wh packs

honestly nobody even asked about capacity, only about what it was. Barcelona and London Gatwick didnt even ask about what it was. Bag went right through no questions

I agree that an option is to have 2x 99wh and 1x 160wh pack, but I dont see how understating the capacity could get them banned. They either let you pass or they dont. If they have equipment to test, its still gonna be yes or no. Nobody was put in harms way by being over the limit per pack.

You are allowed two 160Wh batteries in your carry-on **with airline approval.**  No limits on batteries under 100Wh.  Some airlines allow one 160Wh battery to be installed in your device

> **Size limits:**  Lithium ion (rechargeable) batteries are limited to a rating of 100 watt hours (Wh) per battery. These limits allow for nearly all types of lithium batteries used by the average person in their electronic devices. With airline approval, passengers may also carry up to two spare larger lithium ion batteries (101-160 watt hours). ...

> **Quantity limits:** None for most batteries – but batteries must be for use by the passenger. Batteries carried for further sale or distribution (vendor samples, etc.) are prohibited. There is a limit of two spare batteries per person for the larger lithium ion batteries described above (101-160 watt hours per battery).

> Batteries must be protected from damage.

> Battery terminals (usually the ends) must be protected from short circuit (i.e., the terminals must not come in contact with other metal). Methods include: leaving the batteries in their retail packaging, covering battery terminals with tape, using a battery case, using a battery sleeve in a camera bag, or putting them snugly in a plastic bag or protective pouch.

@jmasta is right on the money.

More fun reading:

https://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/hazmat_safety/more_info/?hazmat=7

Also check the airlines contract of carriage to ensure you're in the clear.  For instance, the [Spirit Contract of Carriage](https://www.spirit.com/Content/Documents/en-US/Contract_of_Carriage.pdf) is particularly restrictive regarding electric skateboards and lithium batteries.  It even references [this 456 page UN document](https://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/trans/danger/publi/manual/Rev5/English/ST-SG-AC10-11-Rev5-EN.pdf) to disqualify as many batteries as possible.

What if the pack is completely drained to 0% and you prove it with the voltage meter! Would they let you on with it attached to the board say a 360wh pack?

Hi - just got from NYC (JFK -> GRU Brazil) with 50 pieces of 18650 Samsung 30Q, individually packed. I brought them on my carry-on (flying on LATAM International). On security checks, they individually opened my bag, found the pack, and open a few ones. They liked the fact they were all nicely individually packed. No issues. I bought them all on ImrBatteries.

Cool. So there seems to be a psychology behind customs way to inspect batteries and electronic material. Is all about the looks. If it looks strange like a C4.... you are doomed. But if they look like individual boxes with simple boring devices inside, they could be boxed bread for all we know and nobody will care at an airport anyway.

I really wonder how far a board needs to be disassembled, until the dutchies don't consider it an eskate anymore :confused:

To me it seem you will be ok.... read the actual full document link.  Skateboards are not self balancing devices.
Call the airline for pre-approval.  I would think you would need to be prepared to say it is a commercially built or just say it is a Boosted Board.  Don't give up so easily!
Just sayin'

People at security at the airport usually don't have anything to check batteries. They work with the written rules they have.
You can always check-in a bag with a battery over 160Wh, and it may go through. The control of checked-in baggage is not systematic, it is done on  a random basis.
If you take it as hand luggage, if you are within the limits of IATA normally there is no issue. Otherwise you can take the risk to miss your plane.

In some cryptic ramble by Jason from enertion I recently watched, he mentioned wanting to launch a battery rental service in future in order to solve the batteries on planes issue.
Would be interesting, where this ends up.
Maybe someone knows which one it was... too lazy to find the vid again :confounded:

Two friends of mine are TSA and told me explicitly that they wouldn't look twice at a battery as long as it's labled or has some documentation attached noting a capacity within the legal limits.

4.) build with “stolen” batteries!
