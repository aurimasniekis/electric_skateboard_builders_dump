Has anyone made a website similar to part picker? I feel like that would be a great help to people. I also imagine they can make money off of affiliate links ;)

Too ambitious of a project ( or at least the worthwhile version would be) that has relatively little payout, and no one willing to do it ðŸ˜‚ 

A basic version could be made but that's like comparing water to syrup
