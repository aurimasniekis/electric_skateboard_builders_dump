BB just released a [blog post](https://boostedboards.com/blog/?utm_source=mailchimp&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=battery_post&utm_term=learn&utm_source=Boosted+2nd+Generation+Customers&utm_campaign=b707763a9d-Battery_Blog_Post_V2Customers_June2016&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_3dad95a28d-b707763a9d-115412245&mc_cid=b707763a9d&mc_eid=91659bc9c7) on how to change their batteries. It's held under the board with 6 hex screws. I'm wondering how they keep the screws from coming out from vibrations without threadlocker. Is that spacer in there meant to absorb vibrations? Just wondering if the community knows.

It's not an area that will get too much vibration, but I'm sure they put a small bit of threadlocker in there to help it out.

Ah ok. The screws on the enclosure near the motor for my board have come loose a couple of times until I really put in a lot of locktite. BB is also not as stiff of a board I guess.

You can use this one M4 and no need for loctite
