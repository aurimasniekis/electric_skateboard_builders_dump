If you're using plastic enclosures

Build onto the deck with dual lock Velcro

If you're using fiberglass or composite enclosures

build into the enclosure, I typically silicone things in.

My decks wood. my encounters wood so I glued them together then also used 4 L-brackets for extra strength. I then screwed my esc down and use straps for the LiPos.

i use this, one side on the components, then the other on the deck

then use foam between components and enclosure to keep stuff from vibrating
