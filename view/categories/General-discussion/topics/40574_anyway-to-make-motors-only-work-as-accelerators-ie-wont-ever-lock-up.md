Is this possible? I don't care about battery regen. I just want to know for sure the motor will never lock up and if it does the wheel will free spin. 

Is this possible?

you could add a ratchet to the motor pulley

why do you fear this so much.  like the ratchet idea though if need be but really cant you get the setup safe enough that youre not fearing a wheel lockup?

So if one of my motor wires gets cut, the motor won't lock up if I check that box?

This is kinda the idea I was going for. I mean we barley get any regen from braking anyway.

That won't help you if the vesc dies or motor shorts... Make some pulleys with one way bearings... Then of the motor locks the wheel keeps spinning.

If one of your motor wires gets cut, nothing will stop it from malfunctioning.
You need to take precautions to insure that they don't get cut.

I think only a mechanical failsafe could prevent lockup from electrical failure

Do they make ones that could work for our application? I found this company Valeo, might have to have custom ones built.

Dont think there is much call for a non motor breaking board. Someone could have a go at 3d printing a fancy pulley.

Yes just use chain drain and a freewheel. You could also probably put some mechanical brakes on it - failproof

One way bearing in your drive pulleys. Completely free from the stresses of lockup.

But having a brake is wayy safer and more useful than an act of God motor short. Go for it, but wear a helmet or two.

Wait. You have a 2 year old that weighs 250 pounds!! I think there are other issues to address..

Regen works pretty well for charging. We just don't brake that much. For Boosted for example, it took only a couple of miles of pulling while braking to fully charge all in like 20 minutes.

I want to fit mechanic brakes to mine too, operated with my heel or something in case all else fails. Stopping my mountain board manually is hard, at least i find it hard with the box in the way.

This is what I am thinking. A one way motor pulley for a front wheel drive board and rear peddle break.

Pedal brakes suck..


Glue on foot braking soles ftw
But if ya want a pedal brake I'll sell ya mine with extra pads lol <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/9/3/93bea16ff6de80c07bd28fab9bc2cfd81a2d02c1.jpg" width="666" height="500">

I would really like to develop some sort of brake setup like the MBS brakes on a normal longboard, actuated by a servo so you could still be wireless, but it sounds like it'd be a pain and finding a good enough servo that's cost effective is a problem

What if you live in a hilly area? You would use regen a lot then

I'd think so too, but regen is a constantly occurring whenever brakes are used, so I assume they thought about the degradation caused by high regen current. Also LiFeO I think is more tolerant of high charge current than Li ion.

I agree but when I go down not too steep hills I don't even use brakes so depends on how you go down.
