My suggestion is for you go try it and report back.

Push starting and coasting will increase range but it is impossible for us to predict how much.

I figured I would update this after doing a few tests.

all out, no push start, I got 10.5 miles

10-12mph cruising and push starting everytime, i got 15 miles.

thats almost a 40% increase.

this is on a 2nd gen koowheel 5500mah 36v battery (198wh).

i weight 77 kilos with a backpack

The Yuneec Ego fets about 18 miles range with a 7s3p cause the top speed is like 12mph but it's no fun riding at that speed. Cruising for me is 18-20mph
