After waiting 8moths+ for my board to arrive i have had nothing but trouble with it , first thing out of the box the remote was broken , ,fair enough these things happen ,contact enertion and they say they will send a replacement straight away,so im pissed off when a week later it still hasn’t even been dispatched yet (after waiting 8 months maybe they could have tried a bit harder)3 weeks later i get it , then the togle that the battery charger pluggs into breaks off ,another 2 weeks for that part to arrive complete with another part that i new nothing about ,i replaced the toggle and the board still wouldn’t charge,turns out the other part that came with the toggle had to be installed becuse of a fault with the original part ,but not a word from enertion about it .so I finally get to ride it but there is a bad vibration in the rear wheels and they are so hard its like riding with concrete wheels . I persevere with the board only to barely touch the brake at near full speed for the board to stop dead and i end up going down for a nasty crash and off to the hospital . So then the remote doesn’t work at all and after many many emails to and from enertion ( when they do reply) i think i have the problem sorted and take it for a few runs and it seemed ok so i was giving it a go flat out up a reasonable hill and half way up it just lost all power and stopped and i keep going resulting in another bad crash and another trip to hospital, and on top of that i have a $2000+skateboard that i have absolutely no confidence in riding cant sell it with any sort of clear conscience and after requesting a refund was told apart from the 20% restock fee they charge a refund was going to take months and months miinimum.
What do i do

That sucks man but it's not an unfamiliar story......

Maybe try salvaging what you can outta the board for a diy build? (Battery, deck, vesc)

Sell the hubs to someone that wants to deal with it. Replace with a simple belt drive?

Im surprised they haven't been sued into oblivion.  It's like if your new car's brake pedal fell off, you crash and almost die, and they send u a replacement car with the same pedal.

Sorry to hear you've been having such bad luck with your board Scott!

A few questions:
1) Does the board turn on and operate as normal without riding it?

2) Does the Unity have the most recent firmware?

3) Are you calibrating the remote before turning the board on every time?


Let me/us know, thanks! :-)

[/quote]

When he described the board coming to a stop by just barely touching the brakes, that immediately made me think of it being him not calibrating correctly. Same thing when he went uphill. If he somehow pushed the remote past what you calibrated as 'full throttle', it'll cut all over until you return back to a calibrated range. I've had both of these things happen to me too, but it's all about calibrating correctly every time. 

Calibrating luckily won't be necessary with the Focbox Pilot, which I strongly expect Enertion to include in the R2.1 package instead of the Nano-X.

Why is this still a thing? 
I don't understand why a $2000 board has a remote that's out preformed and less reliable than almost every other remote readily available. 
How is that not a priority to fix sooner? 

The pilot project sounds great.  And im looking forward to what enertion has to offer. But this really should have been addressed sooner.

Hey man. I see you have just a small issue with the hardware of your remote but this seems to be just that. The other issues I read are 100% user error, learn how to calibrate your remote everytime you ride it, charge it 100% at least 2 times a week.

I know enertion is getting a bad rep lately but rants seem to be very emotional and exaggerated.

I had my board for more than a year and it was able to perform pretty realiably, no major catastrophic problems with it

Thanks for your advice champ , but the remote was fully charged and calibrated beforehand, so maybe before you start deciding what is and isn't rider error you check that your not just bumping your gums and just because you have a board that hasn’t had any issues does that mean that every board is free of faults

Just one more thing there champ , would you be so kind as to tell me how you can tell that anyone is exaggerating, because I’m pretty sure that my elbow that needed to be stitched up and the knee that now needs a reconstruction are a reasonable indication of a decent crash , and before you bestow me with anymore of your skateboarding knowledge I have been riding and building skateboards since I was 8 years old and seeing as I just turned fifty a few weeks ago I do have a limited amount of knowledge on the subject

@Collaroyscot

First off, I'm sorry if I sounded smarty and pretentious, not my intention to upset people at all. 

What you are describing feels like a remote that is loosing connectivity with the receiver defaulting in a reset in calibration during riding, if this happens any throttle input acceleration or brake will feel like full brake or full acceleration even at really small throttle movements, this usually happens when your remote has low battery but not completely dead or when there connection between receiver and remote is lost. 

You should always throttle up and down fully with the remote on and the board off, then turn on the board on. If you ever turn the remote off during a ride session, throttle up and down again fully before hopping into the board back again. If you have done this in all your rides, then forget about this comment. 

You should always wear protection while riding and it should even be mandatory on new boards, just an advice from a fellow member that had pretty nasty accidents when I was younger.

If I were you I'd log into unity UI and look at ppm settings   with the remote, see if it does strange things when you move the throttle forward and backwards, try to keep moving the throttle for 5 minutes and see if it resets, if so ask enertion a new nano x + receiver as your is no longer reliable.

But this is all I can give you as friendly advice, I see nothing else wrong with the board that could cause the issues you have experienced

I've heard of many people with unrideable raptors, but I haven't heard of anybody who has a raptor that throws them off when they break or throttle too much, apart from the solved unity firmware issues.

Stitches and knee reconstruction...that sucks.
I'll be that asshole then. Sounds like this at least could have been prevented. 

Never ride a new board without protection, even if it is a pre-built from Enertion. New hardware is unfamiliar and you simply don't know what it will do until you put it through a few regular and hard routines.

You an aussie my friend?  Liberal use of the word champ is an indicator.  As a fellow 50 year old rider, when I build a board I fully expect to fall off it at some point due to my lack of quality control through impatience.  If I spend 2000 bucks on something then I fully expect someone else to have done the due diligence that I might myself miss.  Its a matter of life and death.  Literally.  If you're going to sell something that can kill the end user if faulty then you better make damn sure its as good as you can possibly make it.  The raptor 2 is the most extreme pre built you can buy so that goes double.  I had one in for repair last year and I spent a week hooning around on it and to be quite honest I liked it.  The remote is commonly known to be the worst esk8 remote you can get though and a lot of the issues you are describing could be laid at its door.  They're are horrible little things.  You could also have some battery issues causing some cut outs.  Common faults and if you read my previous post you will understand.
Only thing you can do is either return the board and demand a refund(there is no way unless you are an international buyer that that 20% bullshit will hold up or get them to repair it.  I for one would be very nervous getting back on a board that has actively tried to kill me twice.  
Hope you heal well brother and keep on with this because it keeps us old bastards young.

Yeah, I know how some people are. Some would never ever use it, cause of some BS pride factor. I'd rather have them use it the first few ride as opposed to not at all.

So Vero tell me do you have to have heard bout something for it to have happened and as for the remote issues, yes it was fully charged and it had just been recalibrated and yes the firmware was the latest edition , so tell me what sort of piece of crap remote needs to be recalibrated before every single use ( none of the other 4 boards I have required you to do this ) this is the same piece of crap remote that has a button on it the changes the accelerator and brake around while you are riding it and it doesn’t even have a timer to cut the power off if you forget to turn it off

Halla,
I have a somewhat similar experience with the board and enertion.
I had to wait for more than nine month for the board to arrive. First mini USB from remote just fell out, it took two weeks to replace (tolerable considering that I live in Norway), wheels were shredded after approximately 60 km due to (in my opinion) the choice of low quality urethane and they were clompletly useless. Then a few days later the in wheel bearing breaks down making klicking noises, the whole left hubmotor was loosening and movable when it should not. At first i had a good experience with the enertion support team but when i sent a frustrated e mail with the complaints building up, the contact suddenly stopped totally and I haven’t heard from them since. The promised new set of wheels for the hubmotor haven’t arrived or been lsent yet either, luckily i found some used ones from another customer who had a none functional Raptor 2.0. I learned my lesson and decided to build my own board, bioboard style. 
I just wanna add:”..... sorry enertion, I was expecting a little more of a somewhat hyped product.

I going to have to post the issue on Youtube and let the world see before they respond im sure.

Mate, buy yourself a Trampa board.  They are by far, the best board on the market!  You can choose one of many models, from street to dirt.  My Trampa board has a top speed of at least 37mph (i'm not gain to go faster than that, but it can).  I also have total control over every technical specification that you can imagine (you are able to input your own throttle curves, Amp output, braking input - everything that you can think of can be programmed by you before you ride).  The decks are very flexible which makes for an amazing ride.   Seriously, why is anyone spending $2k on a board that isn;t a Trampa.  GO on youtube and check them out.  Up until early this year, the Trampa boards came in a kit which meant you had to build most of the skateboard on your own, but they have become so popular that they now build the boards in the factory and ship them ready to skate.  I own a Trampa board but I also own a Evolve GT.  The Trampa board is so much more enjoyable to ride that the only time I ever use the Evolve, is when my 2 year old baby girl wants to ride with me (she sits in between my legs which I can't do with the Trampa because I have a board designed for hardcore off-road and therefore, the battery is on top of the board).

@ripcurldog good to know you love your Trampa...but you do realize this is a DIY forum where many of us can build the same if not better performance board with a $1,200 budget

The Trampa mountain board is in a league of its own. I've always wanted to build one but don't really have that off road need

Eyes wide open here ;)

Not being funny at all, and I've spent a long time looking and a long time building.  Your oversight is that time is the most underrated expense of them all.

Take the price of the components alone and Trampa boards do indeed represent excellent value, that's *before* you factor in labour.  I don't know about you, but it'd easily be 2-3k worth of my time alone to scratch build something near the equivalent.  Research, precurement, assembly, testing, tuning, the list goes on...

Look at the cost of a Bajaboard (which I've also owned) - that too represents excellent value compared to most DIY builds that even come close.  

Respectfully, I've speak from experience - I built a Unity based Trampa from scratch with 100% DIY drivetrain and enclosure, cut every corner to save money - I am a competent engineer not a n00b, and the amount of time that was involved in that alone I could have purchased two ready assembled boards for. 

But where's the fun in that? ;)  Still - we're talking about value here...

Yep because they are far more complex than your typical DIY build so more things to go wrong - and to be fair, very few boards *don't* have some sort of problem along the way.  Even with those issues though, for Bajaboard represents very good value when you also factor in the sheer amount of engineering both mechanical and electronic, particularly f/w development and tuning.  There is a mountain of work involved there - literally thousands of man hours, plus the newer models rectify most of the mechanical issues of the previous ones.  We're all beta testers at the end of the day and tbh I'm surprised they then get away with selling the BB for as little as they do!...

To some maybe, many of us actually get an enjoyment out of building, it's actually relaxing compared to my well paying day job. So to say that MY time is costly makes zero sense to those like myself. I like building a bit more than I like riding.

As far as value, if you don't have the tools, knowledge or desire to build then. Spend your money on a various premium boards that are out there. But this is a DIY forum so your love of Trampa basically goes in one ear and out the other

50% off Trampa

https://www.mbs.com/boards/10405-mbs-pro-97-mountainboard-dwii

30% off Trampa and I actually prefer it over Trampa with the concave and the shock blocks.  

So ya... I don't see value in Trampa.  Just like I don't see value in Haero and Colab decks.  Do I like them and am I buying them, hell ya! but are they value? You smoking crack fan boi

Thanks for some advice that’s factual and not just someone that hasn’t even bothered to check any facts before throwing there 20 cents worth of BS in . What type of remote would you recommend, I don’t mind the boosted remote very simplistic but also very reliable and the evolve  R2 is ok although I have had a few issues with them but I can put that down to me damaging them and even still when they are faulty they don’t just do random things like the tiny piece of shit Nano x, that fall apart before you even get a chance to break them

Any time spent building a board is time that can be spent earning money or enjoying the ride, and it's always more than you expect... you've also got to weigh up the quality and reliably if components used plus any warranty included.

Enertion owe me a refund.
One week ago he was their "Customer Service" guy denying my claim.

Yeah so I quit Enertion because they couldnt pay me my salary and I had to resort to living on my savings account. I burned through my savings and had to find a new job. 

There is a lot more to it, drama, betrayal, but who cares. They still haven’t paid me my due salary worth about 6k or so.

I have 5 customer boards and more products but they don’t seem to think this is something that requires immediate action. I don’t have any funds to send these out own my on tab as I burned my savings working for them.

I’ve been pretty quiet about this for the last 2 weeks as I’ve started a new job and I moved. I’m paying back some family who Loaned me some money while I worked for that company just to afford basic living costs. So right now I’m just trying to recover and finally getting back on my feet. Just bought a car for my wife so things are looking up.

Still want my salary which I earned though.

That is inexcusable. The company is even scummier than I previously believed. Now I am ashamed of even having two focboxes. 

Instead of paying employees, building an alibaba supply chain was more important to them along with trips to Paris etc.

With all the info gathered and the general mess that is Enertion in its current state, it would appear to be unwise to order anything from them. Who knows how long they are able and willing to provide support. They appear desperate and are clinging onto cash to make the next round of orders possible.

@barajabali. Wow, that sucks!  I'm sorry to hear they shafted you like that. It sounds like the rumors of Enertion's impending demise are NOT exaggerated.  I hope you bounce back stronger than before. 

Also, if you can ship a battery pack to Hawaii, I'll hit you up in a few weeks.

Thanks guys, I quit over 2 weeks ago. They tried to come back and fire me, don’t really care how they record it in their records (not like they have any, anyhow) 

That just proved to me that they don’t value their employees. Thanks to this awesome community, I’m still in the business of making packs I love every day of it. It feels good to deliver a product I can actually feel proud of. 

For now, I’m in salary limbo. No responses from their side, unfortunately a handful of customers are being hurt in this process and for that I am sorry. But the bill to ship everything out will be much over $1000 I’m sure. And the way things are going I don’t think I’ll get that back either. And I know the second I ship everything out I will never hear back from them again

Very sorry to hear about your situation, Bara. I've been there before myself with a small business that let me down - I stayed far too loyal for far too long and it cost me more than just money and time, as I'm sure this has cost you more also. 

Any advice for anyone trying to get a refund Bara?

Hi Everyone,

Just wanted to chime in here as I am also one of the affected Raptor riders that is getting the shaft(no response from support whatsoever for the last 3 weeks). 

Bara, you are Awesome! I appreciate all your help the last time you worked on my board.

But my board died again. Well, one of the focboxs did at least. Still trying to narrow down the cause. Luckily, I work with some world class engineers and we spent some time yesterday trying to diagnose the fault with the focbox. And also luckily, there are schematics for the focbox itself that I downloaded from enertion's site. So far, it appears that the Arm processor may have been compromised from an over-voltage resulting in an internal short, but not 100% on that yet. I have one good focbox and we are continuing diagnosis and comparing. There is a voltage divider and a transient voltage suppressor on the batt+ side that may also be to blame. To be continued...

As to what caused this to fail, I don't have any idea yet. There are several wires that have been rubbed through from removal and install of the not so waterproof electronics cover. I will need to remove the truck with the hub motors and replace or repair some of these wires.

I'll try and keep a record, and post here too, as I narrow down the fault and cause. If it is just the ARM processor, then replacing it should only cost $10 from digikey. Though swapping them out isn't the easiest of tasks, I have tools and folks at my work that can help do it right. Plus, we may be able to add some components to help protect the focbox from future issues like this. Fingers crossed.

Again, thanks for all your help Bara. Glad to hear you are moving in a positive direction and working again. If we can sort all these issues out, maybe some of that money can be recouped by means of an 3rd party repair center for those affected. Just a thought.

-G

What's the plan? Legal action? 
Sell all that crap they left you to deal with. 
They can replace their customers stuff with new items lol

That might just get him into trouble.

I guess keeping the items until the financial part is dealt with is totally fair. After all, why should be pay repairs and shipping out of his own pocket.

Meh. If something is left on my property for more than a month when I've contacted the owners or those responsible it becomes mine. 

[quote="telnoi, post:153, topic:99215"]
neither is it Enertion’s.

Nope but it's their responsibility to keep track of it and to replace it if their actions caused it to disappear.

Dude, so so sorry to hear how everything turned out for you. Nobody should have to burn through personal savings just to live while working for a company, that's crazy. I've also got a dead Raptor 2.1 (needs a new battery and BMS) but I've got nowhere with Support.

I think I'm just gonna remove the Unity (which has been good as gold) and put it inside my Vanguard with a 10S3P from @ElectricPacks. Back to DIY, dual UNIK 6355s, sweet.

@barajabali I hope everything starts going your way, by the sounds of things you've made some good life changes and are onwards and upwards! Keep doing your thing :D

Well barb, after reading all this maaaan, this takes the top of the cake!
I knew there must have been issues, but that is just low! I don’t know but they might not last through the night with this kind of business  scheme.

Needless to mention but just for the record.
I m also in cue for support because of a broken hub motor for ages now. The board broke down after 40miles! I sendet them, pics, videos a.s.o.
Than finally I got a message yesterday to open a new ticket and send everything again,.....for better help! Seriously? 
I quit the contact, I wasted enough money and my most valued lifetime on this... 

Stick it to the man,....best wishes to u from Norway! I hope things will work out for you!
Love and respect!

So I should give back their things when they owe me 5 grand in payroll with no eta of when it will be paid? 

Seems like a dumb idea. 

For now, I’m not selling any of their property as I am an honest person with morals. But if they go under (my money is on that) then I will have to liquidate to make up for over 200 hours of my work.

Pretty sure there is a valid legal standpoint and a take justice into your own hands standpoint, but I would never give back those items unless this has been properly dealt with by enertion. 

One approach will be correct. Since I'm not a lawyer I can't provide you with advice on the matter. Not even sure if there is something such as a court case with a free legal advisor for such cases where you are from or if you have ensurance for such cases. We do.

Sad part is, they can and have done so in the past. The original focbox release was equally messed up along with any subsequent direct sales with rebates.

Whenever they drop some new hot hardware, people seem to forget. Even then, those who complain the hardest start kissing ass as soon as they receive a shipping notice, hoping it will somehow move the package faster or something. Usually it's accompanied with a statement along the lines of "all is forgiven. "

Rather amazing really.
Combine the above with examples such as the one here where it is obvious that they don't give a crap about DIY and in part their customer base (poor support with endless excuses). They should be banned by the diy community. New comers should be made aware of their practices, their produxt listings should be removed, this forum should end.

It really upsets me that I still havent received the board I ordered in March, and they updated their expected shipping times to 4-6 weeks on the raptor 2 in July.

Its just a blatant scam at this point.
