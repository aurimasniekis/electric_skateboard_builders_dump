A lot of people buy their motors, wires, plugs, batteries, etc on hobbyking.
Don't forget that "HOBBYKING10" coupon will give you 10% off.
I believe it's always applicable for anyone and anything :) .

It's not mentioned anywhere on hobbyking itself, so I thought some might find it useful.

After using some times, now I can’t use. So I recommend buy many stuffs at one time or make more accounts.

I’m case anyone missed it hobbyking has a 20% off code today “GAMEON”. Seems to work on everything including lipos and sk8 motors. 

Didn’t see a point in creating a new thread since I think it’s just a one day sale.

If you sign up for text alerts they'll send you a code then you can just opt out after they send it.
