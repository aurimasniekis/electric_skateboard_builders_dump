What do you think is the fastest you should go on an electric skateboard ? I've been talking to ngv about upgrading my 68mph to a 96+ mph but now I'm thinking where is too much ? It's sorta like having s big red button where you know you won't push it but you know you could, giving more power in a sense you know ?

Personally I never really go over 50km/h I would assume most people are the same.

Have you actually been up to 68mph?! That seems crazy.

WPH is too fast. Wobble per hour. So dependent on deck. I’ve only been able to go 25mph on my setups. I’m way too high off the ground. Need me an EVO deck next

i’d say get comfortable with 70mph, comfortable enough to where it feels like cruising speed. then upgrade if you want (and feel like you can handle) more

You can die from falling over and cracking your skull while standing in place... chances are pretty low, but it can and does occasionally happen.  Seizure out and break something vital or other scenarios where your head gets split.  One of my friend's brothers fell back from leaning in a chair and busted his head open on a coffee table, wasn't life threatening for him, but could have been if he hit a corner with his head (visit to the hospital stitches and he was good).  Force per unit surface area is pressure, more pressure equals more damage.  You fall on a sword and you're dead.

Also you guys should learn the difference between kilometers and miles before going so fast or post some vids of your land speed records.

Pretty sure fastest I've gone is about 24mph but I don't take it on speed runs anymore since I'm not running a long board it's not really a safe thing for me to do.  I get on avg 12mph on regular cruising around trips and usually peak around 18-20mph, that's a comfortable fast to me, blood pumping and fun but not tear jerking, to each their own though.

That sounds like a pretty stupid idea to me, no offence. If you haven't reached the max speed you can on this board why upgrade it? The next one will also likely have much less torque as they will have to use higher kv motors

The regulations of my country forbid us to hit the road. Pavement only.  Therefore I ride slow mostly. "Too much" depends on the people walking. At mornings when there's no one I can run faster but pavement allows decent speeds only at some streets.

Deck height ain't the problem or the biggest factor though.

Check your set up for upgrades such as:
 - Eliminate slop in your truck (sleeved washers/cupped)
- Run an eliminnator bushing boardside 
- position yourself over he truck as much as possible
- work on your tuck

I’m very happy going 10-15 mph and carving it up  in shorts and T-shirt. 
I have gone 33 mph and it was not fun in my opinion.
At 50+ mph you need full leathers, full helmet, leather shoes and gloves. 
High speed is for adrenaline junkies.

Hey... **150 mufucking km/h on a wood / carbon fiber plank** ? No offense, I don't know your background and I love challenge (aim for the fucking top no matter what!) but given I only know you from here I take you're not a pro right ? 

Have you even been trailered to this speed on a normal board before ? If you are used to ride downhill I take you've maxed out around 100 km/h. Riding a bike or motorcycle at high speed is not taken in account as legit here : you're asking **150km/h from a skateboard**.

Not taking into account the road itself and atrocious forces running amok across your trucks, wheels, etc... you do realize that you will meet a **WALL** of air past a certain speed. This wall will do its best to overthrow you from your board. You'll most likely need to be almost laid down on the board to go this fast, full tuck is not relevant anymore. Chances that you take off and fly into air while your board stays low or turns upside down are high.

Can your board do it? I'm sure there is a way ! And having the "emergency power" available looks **dead** thrilling. Unless you're an absolute athlete and are well aware of your limits, I'd stay away from this idea.

To reach 96 mph you would need 2,8 times the power you need for 68mph. And i doupt the board they sell to costumers is even capable of 68 mph.

To reach 68 mph you roughly need around 15000 watts (20 hp). So 96 mph would be 42000 watts (57 hp).
With tuck you might need a bit less but still too much for a production board.

Hope that somebody shows with a real life test that i am wrong.

I need to go on a nice long smooth 2 lane street or something

Eagles aside, We use long not-busy neighborhood straights and paved bike trails for speed testing. You might need something more though, perhaps a neighborhood four lane road at 4am?

In your picture it shows 64 km/h by GPS. So maybe something is wrong by the gearing or GPS might reacted too slow. But please post that video, would be interesting. Was that a flat street or slightly downhill?

But 64 km/h = 39,8 mph

68 mph / 39,8 mph = 1,708 factor

For double the speed you need 8 times the power (2 x 2 x 2) but we only have 1,708 times the speed it would be
1,708 * 1,708 * 1,708 = 4,98

1742 W * 4,98 = 8675 W

8675 W / 740W = 11,7 hp

for 96 mph it would be 

96 mph / 39,8 mph = 2,41 factor

2,41 * 2,41 * 2,41 = 14

1742 W * 14 = 24388 W

24388 W / 740W = 33 hp

Why are you guys looking at cars and motorbikes??? This has all been done before. The equation below takes into account all drag (including frontal pressure and skin friction drag) as it is based on experimental data. 

---

*Dusts off experimental windtunnel aerodynamics book*

**Drag of a human**

D = Cd * (vH/S) * q
q is based on airspeed and at 61.36mph ,it is 9.0lb/ft^2
v = volume of body
H = height of body
S = surface area of body
**Based on 16 subjects**, the vH/S value varied from 0.65-0.82ft^2 with the **mean at 0.72ft^2**

Cd of several positions:
Standing face forward 12
Standing sideways 5
Sitting forward 7.8
sitting sideways 4.5
squatting face forward 4.3
squatting sideways 3.5
**So I assumed 5 for Cd.**

Therefore at 61mph...
D = 32.4 lbf

Converting to metric yields... 3.93 kW

Now all that is needed is rolling resistance force and the power required to move someone at said speed would be approximated

 At 20mph, D = 3.6lbf
Power = 143W

So 27 times the power, nine times the drag force at thrice the speed. 

So its a cubic relationship which makes sense and is what @ackmaniac was saying before

**Do you plan to take the autobahn on your daily board travels and also, do you value your life?**

Personally for daily travels and just cruising around 25-30mph is good enough with good margins for me.

As far as I can tell, the numbers you provided only represent the power required for wind resistance. I think another 10-20% more power would be required for losses at thr motor, trasmission and to rolling resistance. 

From my own experimental data Ive found that it took me 4000 watts to hit 49mph.

You do know all airplanes are based on data from the 1950s right? The best delta aircraft (fighter jets) models are based on wind tunnel data from the 60s...

CFD models are based on experimental data from the 30s-70s. The reason is that back then they did not have the computational power to do models and therefore they had to rely on experimental data which is much more expensive than running CFD on a computer these days. 

Also physics doesn't change over a course of 50 years...

[/quote]

Correct!
This is purely the power that is needed to overcome drag due to air. 

What isn't taken into account are the following:

**-Rolling resistance: The other main source of drag.** 
To experimentally determine it you would require your board, some weights, a fish scale and someone to pull steadily. You can then pull around however much you weigh on the board, and see how much force it takes to pull it at a constant speed. This number should not vary with speed if I remember correctly. **What will affect it is the wheel material and the surface that you are riding on.**

**-Losses in your gearbox: Whether it is a direct drive or a belt drive**
There will be losses in transmitting the power from your motor to the wheel if gearing is involved. This does not apply to hub motors since the essentially are the wheel. 

**-Losses in your motor: This includes copper losses and iron losses from the magnets.** 
I'm not going to even pretend I understand this, as magnetism is black magic to me. 

**-Losses from your ESC: Any losses incurred in the fet switching and powering of all sensors and stuff associated with the ESC**

**-Losses in your battery: This includes electrical loss due to current transmission and chemical losses from the reaction inside the battery.** Yes, your battery also has losses!

---

What we see measured by the ESC as power (Voltage x Current) is the electrical power going into the ESC and already takes into account battery losses. You can kind of estimate the power coming out of the ESC by taking the RMS Voltage and Current but if I recall that isn't always too accurate. **Most ESCs operate at 90% efficiency. Motor efficiency for an outrunner is usually in the 80-90% range at peak efficiency and I know planetary gearboxes are somewhere in the low 90s at peak efficiency**, I don't deal with belt driven setups at work so I cant say what their efficiency is, although I imagine is similar. **So you could assume a ~70% drivetrain efficiency, 60% if you want to be conservative.**

Was that at a constant speed or while accelerating? Those two will differ. 
You could try going at a constant speed at several speed, eg. 5, 10, 15, 20, 30 for like 30 seconds for things to stabilize and then a cubic curve could be fit and extrapolated to define a model for you and your board.

No real cooling actually, I use FOC box's and they are mounted within the enclousure. I rarely break 35mph so its not much of a concern typically. Im putting these motors on a bigger battery and it should easily break into the 50's. Unfortunately that closed street I test  on is only 1/4 mile long so Ill have to accelerate harder at low speed which pushes my vesc temps up even faster if I want to break 50 and still have room to slow down in time.

we're seeing all kinds of fun things happening around 40mph. Not so much temporal distortion, but handling gets interesting. Especially on that junker test platform Jake's riding around on at 13S. My decks seem more stable at those speeds than that ebay clone. The Popocas are amazing at those speeds, topped out Ru at 38mph in a mostly sort of tuck and she stayed super stable. Probably could have gotten more out of a full tuck and charge but i was only playing with the wheels. 

we're not really interested in pursuing speeds above that because its basically useless for anything other than limit breaking technology. We're more interested in getting everything reliable at those speeds, and the issues aren't with electronics and overheating. They're with ergonomics and vibration damping. 

When we start trying to have a board that can do all of this cool stuff mine do and do 60mph reliably, it stretches the product too thin. You lose things in places you need them, like low end torque for example. The 40mph mark is actually a good upper limit for high end boards (commissioned or production) in my opinion because it allows for a crazy traffic meshing high end in neighborhood and inner city areas as well as bike paths, etc, but also still gives you a lot of power on the low end, and can actually create a more pleasant to handle  board because of the way the motors have to react to the low end on a higher ratio. It also puts the motors efficiency zone squarely in the reasonable distance cruising speed zone. 

Too fast is when the desire for speed begins to take away from the entire experience of the board. To fast means too little startup torque and too little granular control of the throttle, and too little of a "regular i just want to ride it around a lot" board.

68 mph (108,8 kmh) is roughly the top speed Mischo Erban reached during his 2015 world record on ngv's e-board prototype.
Here is the video of this record : https://youtu.be/XptB3rC7EZs

So it looks like they built exactly what they say on their site : "we’ve taken the high speed thrill and passion of downhill longboarding and made it accessible on flat ground".
Furthermore their three speed options (see spec page), roughly match the speed levels of the DH community : 55 kmh = basic, 75 kmh = national, 100 kmh = international. And you can slide this ngv board (with slide gloves), as people do in dh to slow down at speed.
If you add the carbon deck and dh precision trucks to manage vibration dampening at speed, plus the 70 mm contact patch (e-)wheels, you've got in my opinion the ultimate e-board for dh people, or for e-riders who want to develop dh skills.
But of course, for downtown commuting / street skating, this board may not be the best option : forget tight and light turns with these large wheels and trucks, it's low profile is not really pavement friendly...

EDIT : this ngv board looks now like the one from Revoll : http://revoll.eu/cn-1/
So maybe they have shared knowledge to build this impressive solution...

Double barrels mostly yeah. Tall barrels to be precise. (most precision trucks use tall bushings).

If you really go crazy 20-30 degree baseplate in the back and even dominator /stimulator bushings. Means your back truck is almost dead.

+1 with you for barrels and trucks : typical dh truck setup is 20-30 degree on the rear truck and 40-50 on the front...or go for the "cronins" ( ronin cast trucks) with their builtin kingpin (I personally tight a little bit more my rear cronin truck). All this makes real differences when you reach 35+ mph.

Cronins are decent for sure. Super beefy, you can't kill them, and good price point for getting started.
Love my pro lights though. So many baseplate options and just fits my riding style perfectly, felt heaps better to me than k4, sabre, vortex or beefcakes.

Hononorable mentions: kodiaks surprised me quite a bit, ran a few events with them, super solid for turny courses and crazy value for the money.
Same goes for Rogue (cast even), seriously impressed how much stability ,lean and control you get out of this cast truck. Got a few sets so I made a board for my neighbour and a fun set up for myself. And dayum son call me impressed. Those things shred hard for 30$/piece. Throw on your favourite bushings, sleeved+cupped washer bottom and sleeved on top and you got yourself an almost precision dream for about 38-45$ a piece.
The insert bushing and double talls makes it the biggest surprise in the truck departement for me. Still not the same as pro lights or kodiaks but unbeat in that price range. Honestly it is at such a price point that I think it should push out calibers as our main truck imao.

venom double barrels in the back, 94a, loose and snappy. Venom barrel and a different cone in the front, softer durometer, cranked down slightly. Wish i could recall the durometers on the front but its mixed. I have a 94a barrel underneath and a softer stock caliber cone on top. The softer one is the one i have forgotten the durometer of. 

took me about a year to work my ankles up to this but it was so worth it. I can swerve in response to an object at reflex speeds and it just snaps back into position with no wobble. Carving back and forth at high speeds is also pleasant, as well as cornering.

Really sucks that we have such expensive electric components but are stuck using sloppy cast trucks.

I think any of the precision truck market could make a killing if they just machined motor mounts as a part of the the truck, would be better than any welded or clamped motor mounts.

I sold my Ronin Prolites a while back, wish I could have used them instead of calibers. Spaceable axles would be super beneficial switching between pneumatics and smaller wheels as you could offset wheelbite and adjust your setup infinitely. AGGGH.

Have been playing around a lot lately with rather affordable trucks. Got so many friends joinig in at freeriding and need a kick ass set up but for cheap since we are all students. Used calibers mostly for their set ups, occasionaly going for cronins. But once I got a few sets of rogues and rode them myself I am amazed. Found also that most reviews are with me in questionning their pricing. The trucks are way to cheap for the performance. 1 to 1 the same build up as their precisions, innsert bushings seats with double talls makes them superior than any truck I have ever come across in that price segment by a loooong shot. (Annd I tried pretty much all of them except some exotic onnes).

If I only were in the states, I would send you a set and a baseplate to play arounnd for a few months.

I will actually try how far I feel comfortable with rogues, but so far not a single instance where I thought I "only" had casts under my feet. Sure kodiaks /prolites/vortex feel smoother and better overall, but I mean thats 600.- vs 70.-.

Also if you can target your ideal top speed with your pulley ratio and manage to land that in the upper end of the  motor's efficiency zone, you can get even more range out of it. Between the tuck, the tweaking, and the giant balls you can go pretty damned far pretty damned fast. 

I feel like there is some efficiency lost in the lower end by doing this but those are acceptable losses in my opinion. Efficiency is terrible down there anyway.

Truth. mine is more of a running stance/tuck hybrid. Being in an awkward posture won't let you lean back onto the rear foot and brace with your front foot the way you need to brake like your saying. You really do need muscle memory there, as well as freedom of movement. I was watching one of your videos and you stance a lot like i do. 

I tend to lean onto my front foot and only balance with my back foot while resting it in the groove of my deck. Sometimes i rest it on the flat if i'm hammering it on a straightaway or a section with only mild curves, but if the trail is curvey i like to keep the ball of my foot in the groove for steering, and a toe on the edge for reference. Most of my weight is on the front of the board usually, which allows the rear to drift slightly in a controlled manner on curves. I wouldn't call it full on sliding, but traction does break in a predictable and controllable manner. 

every day i love the weird concave of my decks even more. I should send you one.

muscle memory on throttle release is critical. Tactically releasing the throttle happens often and can be jarring so you need to have the reflexes to flow into and out of it smoothly.  

I noticed that the other day. I'm always playing with my mounts and belts and shit but since i switched to the UNiKs i haven't had to. So i'm finally able to see patterns develop that aren't influenced by whatever i just tried. All of that is to say that i'm finally able to narrow in on my required muscle memory for dynamic throttling of turns and obstacle avoidance when brakes aren't applied. And its helping a lot. Especially in my neighborhood which has a kind of awesome mixed bag of great and terrible streets ideal for "race" testing. 

And then i go ride another board and forget the language.

I've done 50 on it so far im getting up there, it takes 12 seconds to go to max speed and I usually run out of rode to do it, I need to find the perfect place for my max speed drive :frowning:

So waay back in Nov17 we were discussing how many watts it takes to achieve calculated speeds. I made a post using a current automobile drag co efficient computer and inputting skate boards numbers. Guess what. We made 63mph at 5902watts = 7.91hp  considering this run was an uphill grade I would say the computer is in the ZIP code.  Hey @longhairedboy did NGV ever take care of @skateswordsman after the melt down? ![Screenshot_20180719-191315|281x500](upload://lzZ55byi15V2yaACZKPdXSEN9Uy.jpg)

During the last 7 months there have been alot of set backs..(a whole damn lot, damon could go on for days) but I decided at the end near late may or early june to send it back to ngv so they can fix it them selves (Partially because there was a lack of communication between the cats and do- oh I mean Damon and Tone on the project) right now the board is in slovenia with tone who is almost done with it, he said this tuesday he needs 3 days to finish it so im hoping that It will ship on monday.
The main problem and why it took so long was because of bad modifications that could of been avoided if they just talked to each other

As of right now the board works, tone is working on a way to make the batteries removable from the board to be put in a lipo balancing charger because our modifications made it so it would be charged like a cell phone or laptop (which fucked up the board in the first place and made the batteries unbalanced)

How have I never seen you lol... I've been irritated that I can't get passed 32mph on a 10s battery on 100mm wheels... but that will be changing with my new build and custom motors

[quote="longhairedboy, post:24, topic:39104, full:true"]
past 35mph is no good for me because i can’t keep my blunt lit. Also, i might spill my beer.

Year latter. You figure out how to keep that lit yet? Still say 35 and under?

The only decent solution is a to use a vapourizer, but its not really the same. You don't look as cool.

I was going to make a thread with this exact title. 

35mph is fast enough for me. 40+ mph is too fast. I had my board geared for 55mph, that was a bit too quick, brakes sucked, maneuverability at low speeds took a massive hit, acceleration is never what it could be... As fun as **fast** is, once I got the thrill out of my system knowing I *could* go that fast everywhere, it's just not totally practical. I hit a max of 32mph on my most recent ride, and although I'd like to go a tad bit faster, I have to concede to what the community has been telling me since the beginning... Although going very fast may be fun, it's really not all that practical!
