Text me at 813 785 8058 if your interested in joining us. I will be parking my Jeep a few blocks from the 1st light on the south side of the causeway.  Look for my Jeep in the picture.

This is a video of what eboarding on the causeway is like:

I'm in, trying to get some unpowered friends to join. There and back is right at the edge of my range. I'll need a half hour or so to charge up on the other side. Dinner?

Drop some GPS co-ords when you find a good parking spot.
