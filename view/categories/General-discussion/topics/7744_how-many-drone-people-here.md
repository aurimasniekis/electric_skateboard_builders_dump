How many folks here are into drones / quadcopters etc etc?
In any form - FPV / photography / racing etc etc - whatever.

Sometimes the tail servo corrects in the opposite direction and some setting needs to be reversed. Try a naze32 or kissFC. A lot has changed since the days of the kk2 and multiwii.

Eh, its nice but it's pretty outdated and the Openpilot gcs devs stopped working on it.
You can flash librepilot or clean flight though...

There are some boards with integrated PDB and VTX now.

I made half a dozen or so 130-250mm FPV quads, still fly them occasionally. Lots of fun, I think I'll fly more when it's summer again and the trees are covered with soft leaves instead of invisible claws of death. <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/2/2ac65e0ecec592b9acd464e93c03e19781c58697.jpeg" width="666" height="500">

Hi, I built a quadcopter from scratch in March 2012, when multirotors wheren't very known yet. I loved the building process as much as flying around.

The quadcopter evolved from a simple flying machine to a budget video rig with a stabilized chinese video camera, many things changed between the begining and it's current evolution.

I dont' fly with it since I started gaining interest in electric longboards, I have to fly it again one of this days. :slight_smile: 

Here is one video made with it while flying with a Cheerson CX-20:

Built a tri with kk 2.0 and just finished a quad with Pixhawk and tarot 2 axis gimbal.  Got some fpv stuff but haven't had time to play with it yet.  Need more channels on my radio to play with different flight settings on the pixhawk. [This one](http://www.frsky-rc.com/product/pro.php?pro_id=144) looks pretty sweet.

Sounds great though. I'm looking forward to flying in some new locations that are a bit far to bother walking to, but have decent enough walking/cycling access. The best flying locations are away from people, with big trees and structures to fly around. An all terrain electric skateboard will be perfect to get there.

I built a qav500 about two years ago, having never soldered anything before in my life.  Was quite proud I could actually build something that flies.

Just recently bought a phantom 4 just for simplicity. With active track and things like that...made it a lot easier to name holiday videos and I felt a little more reassured when flying it.  

Now waiting for my board to come so I can try making some videos of my wiping out...I mean ...

I don't think this is what the thread is aiming for but i've been thinking a drone with esk8 parts would be pretty amazing/crazy.

Y frame tricopter
3x 6355 190kv/200kv+
3x VESC FOC
3x Huge 3 blade props (3 blade has more thrust for low speed)
12s lipo/lion batteries

at 6KW it could easily carry a full size DSLR or something.

**downside** I think it would be too heavy/big to fly in the us as a hobby drone...
**upside** Everything

Until now I've mostly flown old school helis with no electronics.  I wasn't very good, but it was fun nonetheless.

Recently I bought, and subsequently returned, a GoPro Karma, and have since ordered a DJI Mavic Pro.

Recently picked up this guy which has been awesome.  video quality is fantastic with the hero5, and my only complaint is the 20-22 minute flight time compared to DJI's mavic which is 27+ or phantom at is almost 30 minutes.  people give gopro shit for not having fancy sensors, but for me if was more about the whole package of having a drone, gopro, and hand-held gimble.

I actually pre ordered it back in October, owned it for 3 days, and then had to send it back due to the recall...  I now have two hero5's though since they gave me a free one after the whole issue!

I used to be a drone guy. I built two racing style drones during my freshman and sophomore years at Worcester Polytechnic Institute, all out of lasercut birch wood. One was a Hexacopter, which lasted me a long time. It would probably do around 35MPH, and was a blast to fly FPV. I always flew acro, and was quite skilled at it, could beat all the quad flyers on campus flying in auto-level. Unfortunately, this is the only good picture I have of the frame. I used the crazy color scheme for orientation, as I also enjoyed flying it LOS and doing lots of tricks (flips and rolls).

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/7/e/7e33473eb1c0c6e5b9b9290ba30ff1e18e1b0c88.jpg" width="666" height="500">

My next build was a 280mm Quad. It had some really nice motors on it that provided a 5:1+ thrust to weight ratio. Really really fast for its size! It featured a movable camera on a servo arm as well. Unfortunately, on its second flight, it shot up uncontrollably to around 100 feet in about 3 seconds upon arming the motors. Turning the throttle all the way down did nothing, so I had no choice but to disarm the motors. It dropped like a brick, and crashed onto the roof of a residence hall. Whoops...

Took a full two months of convincing campus police to give me the drone back. They had left it up there for days in the rain, totaling every piece of electronics on the aircraft (including the motors).

I have not built another drone since.

But, there is a silver lining to the story. The very same day I lost the drone, I saw a few students zipping around campus on some DIY E-Sk8s. I asked them if I could ride one, and one of them let me do so. I must say, that was one of the most powerful moments of my hobby life, as it completely shifted my interests from FPVing to E-Sk8ing.

I may end up building another one, but being a college student, it's really difficult to fund more than one hobby at a time. For now, it's E-Sk8ing for me!

@oneafrikan

suggest you start here: 
http://www.phantompilots.com/ 

The latest DJI models (Phantom 4 Pro and Mavic) are quiet affordable and can track and follow objects. 
I'm sure there are others (Yuneec, ...)

Then you should be able to answer to those questions: 
- what is the budget you have?
- what quality of photography do you expect? Does it match your budget? 
- what are the regulations in the area you want to fly?  
- is this a one off or do you want to do this regularly?

Is there a cheaper remote that would work? Like this: 
https://www.banggood.com/FlySky-FS-i6-2_4G-6CH-AFHDS-RC-Transmitter-With-FS-iA6B-Receiver-p-983537.html?rmmds=shopcart

 I've been eyeing Banggoods and gravest for a while. Just got my flight Controller. Will receive my 210 frame and 30A ESC any day now. As well as the 2205 2600kv racer motors. 

Also a quick question for anyone.
I'm interested in getting nice shots of environments
I searched that the GoPro weights about 75-180g. I am expecting that just one motor that can provide 1100g of thrust can lift that.
So if my motors+frame+battery+electronics weigh = 1134g(thrust)x4-100g-375g-52g=4,000 g of lift. In theory?

If the location is picked well, it's not illegal at all. If you plan to sell the footage or make money from it or its for your business you have a different set of problems and need to look up regulations from the FAA called part 107..but it's easy to do and find a pilot for even commercial purposes in America..I have friends if anyone is interested in professional work, but I prefer to fly for fun..same with my skating...

I'm in Sf squishy.  how about riding all over san Francisco at midnight chasing my board?  I'll try to lose you from one end of the city to the other.  If you would do it I would.  twin peaks would get some nice shots too.  maybe a small enough drone and no one will notice.  get a couple riders.  I'm sure others would be interested.    you with the googles on the back of a hybrid bike ridden by someone else and you could keep up.   just a pic of you on the back of the bike with the googles would be a nice shot.

I'm having trouble with my motors starting up and continuing to speed up even when my throttle is off. 

Problem:
I would throttle up and then down, do this twice and then maybe 3rd or 4th time the 1 or 2 motors would speed up as if my throttle was full but its not. Any idea?

Just found this thread, yah I finally get to boast about my quad! Ive been working on this baby for a while and entirely rebuilt it 3 times because the second time I soldered my XT60 on backwards and blew everything :expressionless: Its based around the Martian II 220 Frame from Banggood (Most things are from BG) and is my main racing quad. The entire part list can be found [HERE](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yIaJVSKUbOssqgjOXl9uhOWgjcs_DUD9/view?usp=sharing), but the main components are a RunCam Swift Rotor Riot Edition FPV Cam, Kakute F4 AIO FC, Racerstar 2205 Motors as well as RC 20A ESC's, FlySky X6B RX and KingKong Props. I also have a 3D Printed mount for my Yi 4K Action Camera which is an awesome cam btw and has held up very well through a few crashes. For a transmitter im just using a FlySky FS-i6 upgraded to 10 channels and for goggles im using the Eachine EV800's which are awesome goggles with great battery life and the ability to remove the face cover to either mount on a tripod or hold for multiple people viewing. Do mind its a little beat up cause it recently crashed head on into a car bumper, but only broke a blade a real testament to the frames strength. The purple braided sleeving around the ESC's on the arms is probably my favorite feature about the quad as it looks just gorgeous and covers up the wires extremely well while also protecting them. I got the idea from some YouTuber using blue sleeving though I don't remember and cant find anything about it but if anyone knows let me know. The rear light bar is an awesome addition which also includes a beeper which helps a lot with finding the thing. I have the LED's setup to change the bottom row color depending on battery life and the top row just flashes back and forth across. For vibration isolation this quad meets pretty much every criteria and is a bit overkill lol. I have isolation on the motor mounts with 3D printed TPU spacers, I have flight controller mount isolators and last but not least the coolest feature of the FC the onboard foam MPU isolation which you can clearly see on the product page. To be honest I cant tell if the isolation helps at all because it feels about the same as when I didnt have anything on my Eachine Wizard, but who knows. Pics below!

I think when I did the rotation of the board I went to change the angle. I entered 90 when I probably should have entered 270? I'm gonna have to see if that could have been the problem.

My motors are marked the same as the picture:

If your fc is in the position the arrow shows. it should he set at 90. the motor numbers never change. Camera is front. Arm your quad without props and hold it down and gently touch your finger to the top of each motor and see how it spins. it should spin like the diagram shows. otherwise dowbload Bheli of chrome. and you can change how the motors spin their. Also go to the radio tab and check that its regonizing the signals correctly

So I used Betaflight to rearrange the motors using the "resource list" command in the cli.
I moved the motors around. So now the numbering was correct, but the motors were spinning in the wrong direction. 
I then went into cleanflight, reversed all the ESC's so now the motors are in the correct position and spinning in the correct direction. :+1:

What do you mean? Like a drone that can follow you with a camera like DJI's active tracking? If so then I'd say the DJI Mavic is your best choice, maybe the Spark but Mavic is better. If you just want like a racing drone with a camera the Eachine Wizard Kit is good, though I'd recommend just building one from scratch, cheapest and best option.

If you want to save money, you can go with kits sold at banggood. You'll just need a radio/transmitter and receiver. 
If you want to go to the fpv route like @JdogAwesome mentioned, youll need fpv goggles, which will just add $ onto your budget.

Yeah like honestly you gotta crash a lot before you start to improve. I think another thing to keep in mind is simply your mindset of when your flying. I use to think that I needed to practice a lot more just flying in a park and stuff before I started whipping around trees and trying tricks. While that was true it's helpful to first learn how to fly properly, you just gotta eventually just go for it and do whatever you want and fly close to shit and crash a bunch, it's a lot of fun and you learn fast.

To follow the best you can do is use your phone or another gps receiver to send your current position to the drone and them it positions around you in a pre defined way, but that's nowhere near accurate. The next step is vision recognition, but way harder to implement, the best way is with an DJI drone that does exactly that very well

DJI is out of my budget until maybe tax time lol. Plus I love diy. I collected a crazy amount of tools over the past year. I'd like to at least start building in the right direction. Someone mentioned pixhawk to me and someone else mentioned using raspberry pi zero. Pretty sure I saw another method on the net too. Not sure which would be the best for my situation. It looks like they could be further upgraded with different additions over time. So if I start out with the right flight controller, I'd have room to grow with it.

Im using a Pixhawk in my F550 hexacopter and while its a powerful flight controller and the mission planner software is awesome with the telemetry system, your not gonna be able to do any proper gps or vision tracking without some serious coding and engineering. Id say your best bet is getting a DJI Mavic type clone that has tracking as well. Ive seen a couple reviews of some that work very well if maybe better than the Mavic at a lower price. Id recommend looking around on YouTube and other websites for actual products.

I have no idea, never messed around with building drone (yet), currently I have and Spark, but for the part of sending your position to the drone you can use what we use for the remotes, an Arduino + nrf24l01 radio,  with the PA+LN version you could get maybe 1km, but since the purpose is to follow up close i guess that even the basic version

Thinking, i guess you should go with and arduino based flight controller, the only i know ir Ardupilot, them you can modify the code to add the follow me function without additional hardware

For just the follow me is pretty simple, but as i said, accuracy will not be great, the DJI mavic has a pure follow me mode, you can see in the video how it performs. The big problem with pure GPS is elevation accuracy, as a first approach it may be wise to ignore it and manually adjust the camera angle before filming and make the drone hold a constant altitude

Doesn't look bad.  I started off with a 250 size frame too but it's a tough thing to learn on since when you crash you tend to break things more easily on these mid/large size ones.  I'd say still worth getting to start learning on but also good to spend some time either with a simulator learning the controls etc. and/or get a micro one you can fly around inside and not worry about damaging so much.

Regarding places to fly, there are some model aviation fields around my area but really any park with a baseball field or soccer field that isn't being used is a fine place to practice.  Be ready to sacrifice the drone or cut throttle if things are getting too out of control, but at the same time try to learn not to panic.  Learn to do controlled stable hover a few feet off the ground a few feet in front of you with the drone facing away from you then once you feel really comfortable with keeping the altitude fixed and making little adjustments to keep it hovering can start trying to fly it straight away from you and straight back (pitch control).  Once you feel like you've got pitch control figured out then you can "walk the dog" staying behind the quad and walking it around (always keeping it pointing away from you at first since using yaw to turn the front around is one of the harder things to get used to, you have to mentally re-orient yourself when flying line of site.

Yeah I just started actually trying to use my FPV setup recently, up till now have just been getting comfortable with line of sight flight it is a completely different thing though.  When I go fly with my friend who spent a lot of time in the simulator and started off with micro fpv ones before getting a 250 size one has the exact opposite level of aggression when flying line of sight compared to me (basically he's super comfortable FPV and goes fast, then line of sight he flies like granny and exact opposite for me).

Hearsay on this one but from a lot of quad videos I watch lots of people have recommended the inductrix not sure if something better is available but basically would check around on the latest YouTubes from Joshua Bardwell, Flite Test, AndyRC, Le Drib, etc. etc. basically just survey the youtubers who fly lots of quads and see what the consensus is or what people have to say about them.... the lizard (think lizard95) one was apparently popular but that same friend got one and lots of problems, carbon fiber frame shorting the antennae, needed motor dampening parts printed etc.

^^ this was the first one I made using some 2204 motors and really crappy props.  Plus side with the 3d printed one is when you crash it it's easy to print a new part.  Bad side is flexing the body is obviously wasting some energy and makes it tough for the flight controller to do it's thing well.  I've since replaced the frame with:

https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B019TNIUYQ/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1

using these blades now which are apparently not available right now but were really durable still have quite a few:

https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01LZAMNTP/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1

using these motors although they should probably be replaced (lots of abuse, one of them definitely isn't quite right anymore):

Using ESCs below, if I were to buy again I would have gone with something that supports up to 4S because eventually 3S does feel kind of limited (in order to upgrade I'd have to replace both ESCs and motor now).

Yup think better to go micro first get good then build something.  If you want to go bigger though good to build because you're going to need to learn to rebuild anyhow when you inevitably have a rapid unplanned disassembly.

Not into these small 200-250 drones because you just don't have the space to do so. However it's very easy to add to bigger frames like the F450 quad or F550 hex that I have. There's kits out there for like $100 that include a Pixhawk FC GPS and telemetry and you can do all sorts of waypoints and return to home stuff.

When you're not using your LiPo's, are you storing them at the 'storage' charge? Should be in the vicinity of 3.7 to 3.8v per cell.

Also a good idea not to leave the LiPo's at full charge for any period of time.

Sorry if you already knew this, but it seems to be a common problem among a lot of users.

Whats up people, been a little while since I have been on this forum. I am looking to get into building my own FPV racing quad/drone. I was wondering how many quad people we have on here and if there are any that are willing to help a noob out with a first build in the range of about $200, if that is even possible. I have a slightly damaged Blade 350 QX if I could salvage or use any of those parts. If anyone is willing to give me a bit of their time or can point me in the direction of a good forum I would be very grateful.
Thanks,
    Smorto

I've built a few quads and i think the base of this build is fine for an absolute beginner. I would just replace the Naze with a F3 Flight Control and use a better camera, something more like a RunCam. Everything else should be fine and good to learn flying, also not too expensive if things go wrong :D

Buy a tiny whoop or sub 130mm quad and learn to fly with that before getting in deep with 5" quads. 

Tiny whoop are pretty resilient and can take a bunch of abuse. If you do break something, it only takes like $10 or so to get back in the air. 

5"+ can get expensive fast!
