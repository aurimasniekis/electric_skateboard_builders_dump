Hi everyone.

I have bought all the products for my skateboard and I am planning on starting to assemble it soon. But I really like the deck I currently have so I don't want to screw my Enclosures into my deck yet as they will most likely be replaced soon and this will cause permanent damage to the deck. So what are some other ways I can secure my Enclosure to my deck without screwing it in but also still being able to removed in the future. 

Thanks

None that look clean (that ive seen) 
Strapping it on with tie downs, bungee cords, Tape or velcro are options i guess.

Cover the deck with tape and use a ton of adhesives

If you are using a vesc with a case, neutral cure silicone works really well

If your board is flat high strength double sided tape also works

No matter what he's gonna damage the deck lol, even if he used bungee cords, the enclosure will rub on the deck causing cosmetic damage

I don't want permanent damage such as screw holes going all the way through. Cause then when I use the enclosure I want to have I will need to re-screw it into the deck, thus causing more screw holes.

Wood inserts don't go all the way through

Use inserts and even if you do drill thought the deck you can use puddy to cover the holes up and apply grip tapes to hide the holes.   Remember it's a skateboard.  It's meant to be ridden and it will get damage.  So appreciate it while you have it and enjoy.
