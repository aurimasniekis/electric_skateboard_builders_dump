This talk/chat button has appeared recently. I don't use it and was wondering how to remove it as it spoils my forum browsing experience.

Pretty sure if your on Mac you should be able to go into all my files in finder then click â€˜command Aâ€™ and then â€˜command Oâ€™, you might need to do the same in downloads too. Hope this helps ðŸ˜Š
