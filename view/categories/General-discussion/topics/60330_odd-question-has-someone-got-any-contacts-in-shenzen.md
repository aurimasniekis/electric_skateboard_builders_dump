Hi everybody,
I have a rather odd question so let´s get right to it:
So I´m flying to Shenzen/Hong Kong on Sunday and will be staying there for 5 days. So my question is if someone knows if I can source some esk8 parts directly in Shenzen or if someone has any contacts.
Thanks for reading :smiley:

The Electronics and Tech fair in hong kong and Shenzhen(kanton fair) is your best bet. You need to apply for attendence months before tho.Think theres one in the summer as well.

Of course, Shenzhen has a lot of electric skateboard factories. But you only have five days, it is best to buy ESK8 parts in Taobao or Alibaba.
