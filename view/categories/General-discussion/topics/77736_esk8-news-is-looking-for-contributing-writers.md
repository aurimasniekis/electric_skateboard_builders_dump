i've been working on building a legit esk8 news site with a few other people and i'm ready to crank it up. For now I'm doing most if not all of the writing. I have other contributing writers on the list, and one has even been published, but things are moving a little too slowly for my taste. It's time to step it up. 

I'm looking for more people with knowledge of the industry, insight into how things are about to play out in general, decent writing skills and the ability to meet a deadline. if you think you have what it takes to submit articles regularly (as in twice a month or so) and are willing to contribute, let me know. 

At the moment there is no compensation for this except the byline, but i'm hoping to reach a critical mass of content that will begin to draw readership and allow us to run ads for vendors, thereby gaining revenue for hosting as well as paying people for their contributions. 

I know a few of you are articulate, well versed in the industry, and are looking for a venue like this. This is a great opportunity to become part of esk8 journalism in its infancy and grow it into a behemoth of an influential community. If that appeals to you, and you have the drive, hit me up in a PM.

I am definitely interested.  I don't write much other than reviews and how to's if that acceptable.  I have made it a point to NOT turn this into a job for me, like I did in the past with Bikes, Jeeps, hookers, etc :).

Damon I am not able to write you any articles because I suffer from a lack of adult genes. I am however available for an interview at any time.

Wow, I didnâ€™t even know of this. I just read the direct drives article and itâ€™s very well done and interesting.

I would be happy to write some articles, unfortunately I suck at anything English related ðŸ˜”

I'd love to contribute. shoot me a pm. I'm no professional writer but i seem to be able to explain things and write about things in ways that people understand. I'd need to get my hands on a few more parts like vescs and motors but apart from that i have a pretty good idea (not to piss in my own pocket)

Coming from a man attacking my typing skills earlier.  Probably attacking my penchant for falling asleep at the keyboard while leaving the reply window open.  It is a talent.

I can write pretty well and I have a few ideas of things I can write about, however I am not sure I would be able to commit to two articles a month.  Just think I would run out of ideas after my fourth or fifth article.

 I think with the number of people interested in doing this, we should  develop some sort of schedule or calendar so we can all write a few articles here and there.  We would still need to make sure everyone on the schedule is committed and ready to meet deadlines.

@sender and @Lunasi still owe me articles, as does @treenutter.

@Saturn_Corp this is all very fresh. The world needs some kind of esk8 news source/community, and i don't see conde nast stepping up. 

@maner yes please. The Getting Started section is one i hope to fill with how-tos and guides, as well as basic knowledge and advice.

I want to take the "Is DIY right for you?" Article I am working on and condense and pair it down for there as well.

Also a Moe Stooge wheel review possibly.

And, unless someone else is taking it, maybe "2019, the year of the Hub motor? "

Or something like that.  

When is our deadline?

Did a video a while back with Moja where he gives some good riding tips.

A lot of it is about your stance and also if you're doing DIY what you set your acceleration curve to.

I've got the "Esk8 year in Review" drafted, which is retrospective vs looking to the future. It'll be same format as the one I did last year.

That's the problem, don't start from a standstill.  Kick off.  It keeps you loose, saves more battery that you would believe and it leaves you in a more proper stance.

Awesome!  Figured something like that was already on the docket.

What else are you thinking about article wise?  I want to get a vibe for what everyone else is thinking about doing.

@longhairedboy what all articles do you have in the works?

Also, maybe it would be a good idea to post "article assignments"  that you want to be taken on so we can snag them up.

This will help getting the areas flushed out that need to be there early on.  Like a good framework so to speak... just a thought

When is our deadline?
[/quote]

I'm looking for regular contributors who can bang out a nice article at minimum twice a month. That's the minimum pace i'm setting for myself, so the deadlines are "in two weeks" for everything. Preferably i would like to have a new one every week. If I got a small crew together able do one per week, we'd have something new every day. But that's expecting way to much this early in the game, so two in a month seems a reasonable goal for now. 

this doesn't mean gimme something in two weeks or your out. I will gladly accept articles at any point from anyone for review. But i am trying to create a core group of content creators who will see this thing through to monetization and maybe see it make some money for events and other things of that nature.

Please send me everything, any and all relevant details, times, dates, who's going to be there, etc etc as well as any imagery that you have on barret junction and it will be featured in the events category. Also, i'm still figuring out ad space, so hang on to your cash for now. I may be able to sell you a square on the page for it as soon as i get it figured out. 

We'll probably do flat rate ad space to begin with and offer it exclusively to DIY vendors and event organizers, etc just to get better hosting. Right now its in my dreamhost account (which has a metric fukton of accrued bandwidth because i've been with them 11 years) but its still shared hosting and we want dedicated with support. 

I'm also hoping to develop some sort of real time group ride map/event schedular thingy at some point that allows people to create group rides at specific locations and allows other people to see them on the map and join in. I have no idea how that would work but its being looked into.
