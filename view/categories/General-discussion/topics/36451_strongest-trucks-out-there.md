What are the strongest trucks out there that can handle abuse??

I was looking to get some independent titanium trucks but they don't have rkp trucks... I need something sturdy for my next project... :smiling_imp:

Requirements: atleast 160mm and axle all the way through. Preferably titanium or chromoly. No aluminum stuff please...

Thanks!

trampa trucks?

i know theyre durable but im not sure about the size requirements...

i'd say NoSno... but I'm reaching, strongest for what bro?

as far as material strength goes...
but axle dia. is larger, bushings are bigger X 2...
 
what are you trying to do?

There are a few eceptionaly durable trucks. The question is how much are you willing to spend. The ronin Truck might be a good option, since if you ever have trouble with the axle it is somewhat replacable. The truck is cast then bored trough for the axle.

Sick trucks would either be Buzzed V3 Mega Beefcakes or Bear kodiak. Both known for surviving almost anything.

I was actually looking at ronins last night. I'm really interested in their 150mm hanger trucks. I wonder if they kept the same width axle. If so that would be perfect for my project...

We have the strongest trucks, going in at a 12mm axle. 20x stronger than 8mm axles :)

A larger axle doesn't necessarily make it stronger. I mean no offense to you, but I feel like a lot of sellers in this forum don't have any engineering background and just advertise their stuff as the best :poop: ever until it breaks....

I am looking for trucks that have been abused by skaters over years and years and survived. 

Now, that doesn't mean you can't convince me otherwise but you'll have to make a much better argument than that. What material is your axle, why did you go with said material, is it a through axle or does it bolt onto the hangar, what material is your hangar, what is the geometry like and why. These are only a few of the questions you or any other seller on this forum would have to answer before I consider their trucks. If you would rather answer through pm as to not give anything away to competitors, I'll respect your wishes to not spread said information and it would be kept between us regardless of whether or not I purchase your trucks :)

E: There is absolutely no info on said trucks on your website either...

Completely uneductaed in engineering. So this is a question I was courious for a long time.

 From what is constantly talked about in our riding groupes is that the Ronin truck is so good for its price (aside from the support pin which allows for a bigger rake but still stable at higher speeds at 44 degrees ) is because the truck is cast, then bored trough and the axle put in it. Other cast trucks are cast around the axle whitch makes every truck by definition unprecise. Also given that the axle can "move" around it is more durable since it has leway during vibration and the material expanding with higher temperatures.

Was allways intrested if this is true. Its what we have been preached and since they simply give you the best bang for the buck All of us silently agreed with that statement.

Some trucks are die-cast, these tend to be brittle and will fail under heavy use or from extensive vibration from MBS wheels. Sand-cast is better...Sand-cast in a US foundry even better due to the tighter regs and QC.

If you are looking into Trampa trucks, then I would not say that they are all durable and can withstand abuse.  I personally bent my vertigo trucks, equipped with twin drive and only after a few jumps.  Thanks to Jens at E-Toxx, he sent me another hanger Infinity which is stronger.  So in my experience the hollow Axles cannot withstand 1m jumps, I weigh 63kg.

INFINITY Trucks = SOLID Hanger & Baseplate with 12mm SOLID Axles & Nikle plated Kingpin
VERTIGO Trucks = CNC Light Hanger & Baseplate with 12mm HOLLOW Axles & Stainless Steel Kingpin
ULTIMATE Trucks = CNC Light Hanger & Baseplate with TITANIUM Axles & TITANIUM Kingpin

4140 is a common steel for axles and used in the trucks evoheyax is talking about.

hah thanks for pushing it up.. I opened this thread just throw the idea about NoSno trucks also and then I saw you was here before me already :D

So yeh.. I would also agree.. - strongest for what purpose exactly?

Though I think the best test is really jumping and applying a lot of force on the trucks.. that should show whenever they can take the abuse and are not weak..

Not many manufacturers use titanium or chromoly. Titanium trucks would be very expensive, I'm thinking somewhere $500+ (I pulled this number out of my head).

Yeah, there are a few brands out there that make titanium axle trucks fairly cheap but they're not rkp...

I thought chromoly was a standard as far as axles go. What else is there?

I think I might reach out to Ronin and see if they can do a custom cast with titanium axle or ask them how hard it is to press the axle in, I got a 12ton hydraulic press that's up for the challenge :imp:

Em, in my oldest pair of ronins, the axle moves around alot. Meaning changing wheels i was like wtf, where did the axle go, was all on the other side. If you want I can show you pics and take the axle out measure it for you.

It would be great if you could send me some pictures!

I'm finally off work so it's time to do some more research on trucks!

Just a thought. Trick skaters imagine put a ton more stress on their axles than esk8 and they have 8mm axles. I think material (note: not grade of material) is less important than quality or even size.

They also go through trucks like crazy. I don't remember anyone in my teen years having trucks longer than a year. Heck, I don't remember anyone having a single component more than a year!

I would always wear my wheels out, my one friend destroyed trucks grinding on them all the time, and the other couldn't go a few months without needing a new deck cause the kicktail was gone! Man, those were some fun days! I always preferred roller blades back then though

Nope. Maybe. I don't remember ever seeing an axle snap. Bunch of bent ones and literally worn out hangars

Look at the surfrodz precision trucks that @psychotiller sells . I've only ridden them for an hour but they are the most stable at high speeds I've ever ridden.  With 80mm axles they are hella wide too.  I was carving like a beast and they were incredibly predictable.

I've never left a set of truck as loose, bushing wise, as i have these. Mondo carvy and stable at the same time, I'm really impressed with them.  

Had to threaten my kid with a beating, he wanted them as soon as I walked in the house 😀.

Arsenal Cast trucks are extremely strong and come in 165mm and 180mm.  50 and 44 degree base plates are available, i suggest a 50 degree front and a 44 degree rear. The trucks take "Tall " bushings (around .75 tall)

@Alphamail I know this is an old post, but do you have any experiences with tall bushings on esk8 setups?  Like the arsenal trucks you mentioned here, if I understand correctly you were involved in the design of those trucks? How will it handle sudden acceleration and braking forces from the motors etc. Any reason not to go for tall bushings in a esk8 setup? From what I can tell, the arsenal trucks looks like fun, carvy yet stable.

We were involved in some of the design aspects of the Precision Arsenals, not the cast as we would have done some things about them differently like duplicating the shallower bushing seat on both sides in place of a deep roadside and shallow boardside.  If you are a heavy rider, tall bushings require you to run a harder bushing and as bushing hardness goes up, rebound goes down so you can lose some of the properties you like about standard .6" tall bushings.
