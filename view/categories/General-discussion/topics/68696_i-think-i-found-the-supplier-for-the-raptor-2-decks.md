Company name is called 东莞市鑫达体育用品有限公司， was looking at deck factories when I came across this. ![image|256x500](upload://o7WhZt5BNsElWWQpGygCHDVBTSg.jpeg)

Don’t know why the lady is installing a random truck instead of the cnc ones raptor uses on it though, maybe they’re selling it to other customers?

yeah that’s it. They have some pretty nice decks although you need to individually dig into each product page’s pics since they don’t list them all

Good find,  There's a few brands here that white-label Foxen because they use verified Canadian-sourced lumber in every layer (in their premium line, anyway).

Apparently they’re not selling it due to design being owned by enertion but I was told it’s 47 usd a piece, compared to their 13 usd decks which already seem pretty high quality

Or they are just using it to see where to drill the holes to mount the raptor trucks...

Interesting bit of trivia for the deck. Although I wouldn't suggest considering it for a DIY setup. There are better options out there.

looks like the bamboo gt deck even has holes drilled out for the evolve enclosure. This is from another factory though.
