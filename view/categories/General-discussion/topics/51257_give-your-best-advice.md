What is the best advice to builders both new and old? Whether it be something you think about when building, problems you came across and overcame, or just something you live by, what wisdom can you give to the community?

My best advice is to fail faster. The faster you fail, the faster you fix, and the faster a final product is made. 

Also, wiring. Pay attention to the lengths of motor wire, they should always have some amount of slack. Depending on how you turn, you can pull on the wires which can cause problems if there isn't enough slack. 

For gods sake, do literally everything you can to protect and fully insulate the phase wires. Don't kill your vescs!

Think at least twice before u do anything. (For example fry vesc or ruin your battery)

You should be spending 3x time in researching vs actually building.

I would argue if you do proper research you won't have to fail and fix.

It’s okay to fail but in eskate scene it really isn’t due to it can lead serious damages.

+1 on insulating your phase-wires. Found that out the hard way.

That was basically my point, failing here is sign that you may have skipped on some research.

- Pads, all of them, if you intend to ride above 25.
- loctite
- foam pad your enclosures, no one likes a rattle machine
- wire slack, yes the boards flex even stiff ones, leave some slack in your wires
- adjust your chargers to proper endvoltages, if you don't your fancy bms may never kick on if the chargers voltage isn't adjusted for the load of your pack
- wider belts the better, if you can't go wide use an idler
- setup your ppm endpoints, center points and failsafe properly
- program VESC based escs independently with isolated power supplies, then later connected to canbus.
- bigger wheels the better, the more reduction the better
- use Ackmaniac firmware, it's the tits, and has loads of extra features not baked into stock warez, as well as improved safety features
- Antispark switches 95% of the time are a waste of money and will fail... eventually if not quickly (stick to as150 or xt90
- toe stops, find one, use one, thank it(unless you have a drop/microdrop)
- griptape, don't be cheap, good grip is your glue to the board
- skateshoes, they make a difference
- bearings, ok I know your board is all fancy, but 100-200mile intervals for bearing services
- replace your wheel nuts, often, 5-10 times on and off and you should be spending the $2 for new nuts
- don't use stock bushings unless you wanna end up in a bush, tune your board for you

I said it first, but pads, do not skimp on them if you intend to ride at speeds this is the most important piece of building that is overlooked.

The amount of time you spend researching and asking question is INDIRECTLY proportional to the amount of money you will go over budget. 
TRIPLE CHECK DIMENSION of EVERY SINGLE OBJECT/HARDWARE AS WELL AS SPECS

Don't re-invent the wheel when you don't need to.

Rely on whats out there thats been tried and tested, and limit your scope.

This is especially important for builders who are trying to sell.
Earlier on when pre-builts started showing up on crowdfunding sites you always had people trying to come up with plans that involved building their own decks, making their own wheels, making their own trucks, and trying to innovate and improve everything all at the same time.

Then boosted came around and got it right. Used well known high quality, and good looking parts that were already out there and respected. And all boosted needed to do was to assemble and motorize it.
Much smaller scope, less room to fail, and much less work.

- Put a fuse in our board. Put the RIGHT fuse for your setup.
- Make sure your cables are the RIGHT ones based on your setup (max amp, etc.).
- Check brakes before your go on ride after powering on the board.
- Have fun, a lot of fun !

The more helmet, the better :joy: I use a motorcycle helmet. Already saved me once, I will never not wear it again. Especially after reading about Randy Jensen, people really need to wear them. There's no reason not to honestly.

Be adept at non-electric riding before you build or ride an esk8 

Respect the time of others when you inquire about esk8 building - builders here are nice and will try to answer all of your questions politely. Don't abuse that kindness. Do your own research and ask informed questions when you hit a point where no answer is already published.

Build your eks8 around a deck that you love. This is the place I see people skimp all the time to save money. Once all of the esk8 parts and configs are sorted out, the deck is what impacts the feeling of your ride the most.

Ride any DIY project like it is an experiment that could fail at any time. That means helmet, pads, and caution. You're not an expert, your board could fail at any time.

Think in the long-term about what parts will last rather than getting your board to move for the first time right away. It's great to experiment with "whatever you can find and afford today" but hacked together parts don't provide lasting enjoyment. Sure you can use glued-together soda bottles for your enclosure, but you'll be left on the street with a broken kit pretty soon.

I actually think Eskate would be a great way to get in the time and experience to become proficient quickly.

Its so easy to get out and ride, to put in time, and to keep things within your limits.
The speed you go isn't tied to the hills you can find.

But I do agree in terms of going fast. Any Eskate that people build here is not something I'd recommend for beginners because they're just so capable. But something thats limited to 10-12 MPH, that'd be great for learning.

Lots of good advice here already I think, but just adding my .02

* Ride with the assumption anything can fail at any time (1 pin comes loose and you could have throttle go haywire, make sure your failsafes are in place and work, test them on the bench).
* Assume you are invisible to drivers
* Take side streets when possible, one street off of a main street seems to typically be still pretty well maintained/easy to ride in my area
* Know your local rules/laws and how police in your area will react
* Don't ride above your level, if you are feeling uncomfortable or getting wobble you are going way too fast for your setup or skill level, slow down or eat pavement
* Keep your loop key and remote in your helmet, easy to find reminds you to throw the cap on every time, after a while you feel weird without it
* Keep some tools in your bag and some tape, a leatherman/multitool and some electric tape can get you home if something fails while you're out
* Figure out how long it will take to recharge your board given your chosen method of charging (keep in mind limit of 1C for batteries when charging, also likely limited by the wattage of your charger so check that)

That's all I can think of for now will add points if I think of any.

measure twice - cut/drill once. In that order.

And wear a fucking helmet.
