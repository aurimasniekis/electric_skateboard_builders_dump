Im debating weather or not to move away for college. Its at conestoga and im approx 3 hours away so i will have to live on campus. I dont have all of my courses that i need but i can do a upgrade course after i get my deploma to move onto getting a degree. It is a very new and nice collage it loket impresive when i toured it but im debating if i should go and do the upgeade course in the summer for my math course that i failed or if i should stay home another year and try to pass it save up some money and re apply next year. I dont really want to move away but it is a 5 year bridging program. Which means i wil be hella old if i stay a other year. Its gonba suck either way because if i go to college i will miss home and if i stay all my friends will of already left so i will be lonely. I just wanated some peoples opionions on the topic because i am very confused and stressed.

I think you should go, if you wait another year it won't be any easier or harder, just stressful longer.  Unless you're picking up a trade, you're gonna need a degree before you're gonna get a decent job.  Mech eng pays pretty well and you get machine shop access for free so take advantage of that and get free motor mounts made

If you go away for school, I'd definitely start spelling college correct, show them you mean business.

That's it my guy, and yeah English is dumb.  Luckily for mechanical you don't need to be a good languager, because numbering is more importanter.

I thought Canadians use English. That was really hard to read. I guess You just need to speak math and CAD for mechanical engineering 😂

If you can start in that college...financially and scholastically then you should just do that. I feel that living away from home is an experience everyone needs to have. Just do it responsibly. You need to start networking with like minded people as it will help open doors in your future career.

I beg to differ.
Almost all the standards are written in English.
Reports and correspondence in major/international projects are also in English.
I am a mechanical engineer and more than 80% of what I do is in English.
Numbers are important but communication is equally important.

Yeah sorry about my lack of qualty english. Too bad i csnt talk with numbers😂

I a just afariad of living away. Afariad of being alone and missing family. Its really starting to fuck with me. Thinking about all this shit. I just wish i could go back to grade 8. I know that my mom dosent want me to go away and whenever i bring up the subject she gets kinda sad so that will be fun to deal with.

I understand. And it makes sense. Im actually not bad at english i was just making a joke. But when it comes to typing i am lazy and will take shortcuts. That is probally y it is so hard to read.

Trust dude, I feel you.  I'm LDS (Mormon) and did the two year mission thing in another state, not able to visit or be visited.  It was scary at first, but it was far more in my head than anything.  The freedom, ability to learn self reliance, and gaining appreciation for my family grew exponentially.  Enjoy the time with your family, see a therapist to talk out any issues and learn healthy coping mechanisms, you'll be great.

Don't be lazy then.
Proper typing shows respect to the ones you are having a conversation with.

Oh. That reminds me. I left out one important part. It may not seem like a big deal but it has ruined my last couple of years. I dont know y my body does it but whenever i fell anxious my face will turn bright red. Just like some people get sweaty poms when doing a presentation however mine is clealery obivous. I have been peenalized for it and would now condider it a panic attack. It will occur almost once a day and i am starting to recknize what trigers it but i cant do anything about it.  None of my teachers understand and its kinda a tough topic for me to talk about. It has definetly set me back a number on the social scheme. I know iys all in my head but cant seem to get it out. I am afriad that it will be a regular thing in college for me and il be right back where i started.

I work with majority Mormon people (company was founded by a Mormon family). I apologize for the language you experienced here 😂. 

It’s really crazy how you guys do two year missions before college and get out into the workforce older than most. Me being Chinese is that I study and go to school until I die

Therapy dude, both when I left away for college and right before my mission.  I get panic attacks (don't turn red, but start shaking, repeating the same thoughts, and crying uncontrollably) but therapy has been helpful.

Haha yeah, lds life is tough at times but I've enjoyed my life as a whole.  The language doesn't bother me, I grew up around lots of colorful language/lifestyle in Los Angeles, it usually makes me laugh.  Though yeah, finishing school late isn't the most fun

Another mechanical engineer here! Here's my two unpolished pennies found between the couch cushions:
Three hours' drive from home doesn't sound too bad, you could be in the dorms and go home on weekends. As you progress you'll likely make friends there and have more reasons to stay for weeks at a time and the distance won't seem so bad. I don't know what your family situation is but remember that they're just a phone call away...
You say that this is a "new" college? How new? Do they already have a good reputation? Check and see what the background is, who the teachers and professors are etc. 
I'm going to make an assumption, correct me if I'm wrong, that you're a high school senior? If so, my personal opinion is that five years to finish a degree is perfectly fine, and no one is going to think that you're "too old". Mechanical engineering is hard, I say that as someone who barely passed the early math courses. If you like what you see at the college though and this what you want to do I say go for it.
Oh, and definitely work on the spelling, frustrating as it is. Do that, and in a crowd of bad spellers you'll stand out as the true professional.😉

It's weird, I loved the physics and had no problem with it, but the math haunted me the whole way through. Meanwhile a friend of mine there aced the math but just couldn't visualize the physics. 
I dunno, guess I just hate abstract numbers.
Hang in there, good luck with your midterms!

I'm was a smart but lazy. Took three quarters of physics in college late 90's. Instead of learning, I made programs on my TI that asked for values and gave me an output. Now kids got apps

How old are you?. Don't be scared of the "im to old" scenario. If you're not ready to study then wait abit. Especially if you have pay for it..I graduated as an EE at 26..here I am at 29 looking at masters programmes cause "they seem cool". Then again, maybe abit different cultures.

Here's my mediocre advice, since I was in your shoes not too long ago.

Moving away from home can be kinda scary. My school is about 1.5 hours from where I grew up, but it felt like 1000 miles when I was a first-year. I was worried about passing classes, making friends, everything. My family was sad to see me leave, but they understood that it was a part of growing up. My mom is still sad whenever I have to come back to school, but she knows that I'm learning what I enjoy and loving college. You can do it.

Taking a gap year can be really helpful for some people, but not everyone. IF you KNOW you want to go to college eventually and IF financially you CAN go to college now, then I think you should go now. I had a friend who took a gap year for no real reason and was bored after 3 months. If money is a concern, however, then I think waiting and avoiding debt is the best option. A little bit of boredom is worth not having tons of student debt.

As for dealing with anxiety, I can't speak to that personally, but I've had friends deal with it. Like it was said, therapy is amazing. Most schools will offer some form of free or heavily discounted therapy for their students. Just a thought.

On the practical side, if you're considering studying engineering (of any variety), be sure the school you go to is accredited by a 3rd party professional organization. What that means is an official non-governmental organization has given its seal of approval on the education quality of the school. In the USA, that means ABET accreditation is key. Since you're in Canada, it looks like you'll want approval from the Canadian Engineering Accreditation Board (CEAB). This basically means that a group of professional engineers has given your school the thumbs up. 

Apologies for the short essay. I hope some of my ramblings were helpful.

First: get over the fear.  You will make more friends in college than you have at home.  Everyone there is about the same age with similar goals.  A very important lesson is "don't worry about what you can't control".  Or you could go with the quote from an imaginary green little person:
“Fear is the path to the dark side. Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to suffering.”
Any way you want to look at it, it is wasted energy and it will prevent you from reaching your goals.

Second: you will have to improve your English to get an engineering degree.  Everything we do is documented - you have to be able to write well and they will enforce that during your education.  If you also need remedial work in math then I suggest you enroll in a local community college immediately, or if you can afford it, hire a tutor.

Third: stand up straight.  Look someone in the eye when you meet them and give them a firm handshake.  Smile a lot.  If you appear confident people will treat you like you are confident and you will become confident.  Understand that all humans have anxieties.  Some just hide them better than others.

Good luck.

Another ME here, graduating in a month, it’s not for everyone, live 5 hours from home and I enjoy it, do what you have to for a solid education, I would not wait.
