**This is EXPERIMENTAL**
Please DO NOT attempt this solderless build method unless you have alot of experience with building battery packs

**Before you comment what most people already can figure out.. YES It is not a super solid battery pack - It works for me and my requirements**

I needed to build a battery pack with some SONY NC1 cells I`ve had sitting in a box for the past 2 years...
BUT
 I didnt want to spend couple hundred dollars on a spot welder and 
hardware... so I made due with readily available materials.

 .high strand tinned wire
 .electrical tape
 .wood stir sticks
 .polycarbonate
 .stretchy rope

This is my 2nd attempt.. the 1st try worked great even outdoors in sub-zero temps.. The reason I re-built it was to add 2 more cell per parallel string..
Also.. I carry the battery in a backpack and have recently taken some big wipeouts.. the cells are tightly bound between polycarbonate..

Fairly straight forward... The next pack or If I rebuild this one I 
would try to use high temp duct tape to secure the cells together.
Any questions ??

You should just solder it because if the tape comes loose ur going to have shorts against ur cells

also not likely to be friendly to vibrations and bumps on an e-board.  you don't want cells constantly being disconnected and potentially becoming unbalanced.

Well thankyou willpark16 
I dont think a person could build a pack like this if they did NOT already know that!

Thats more effort than soldering or welding. But it is different. How does it work?

I want to build something one day with strong spring loaded 3d printed cartridges for each one. It would be cool if they made cases of different sizes that you just slide them in and you could have different configurations of packs (12s4p, 10s4p, etc.)

I think the issue with spring loaded cases and why we dont see them for sale.. is they cant handle high currents.. erosion of springs and materials.. springs losing their spring etc... A case needs to be proven to work for 2000 hours without any degredation. Otherwise the seller has liability.
The primary advantage of these 18650 type cell packs is their low weight
 and compact size for any given capacity, and anything you add will 
detract from that.

Very well said. If I ever try to do anything I'll research the concept a great deal and see if I can built it directly into the deck itself so it doesn't add much size and weight. You gave me great things to consider.

Sorry if my initial post came across overly critical.  

Cool build - good ingenuity and obviously some skill involved!  

Still think it's not durable enough for the moderately crappy roads i ride sometimes, but if it works for you - awesome!  It would be great to swap to a cell config i want more easily, or if you kill a cell swap in a replacement...  I also liked a few of the builds they've done w/ neo magnets.  More options and ideas are always cool to have!

gl!

At first I also thought - uh this is something I have not seen before.. will it even work?

but after I saw the clever wood panels on top of cells and also the ''reinforcing with plates'' it got me thinking this might work ok! 

@solarcross So do you press the plates holding the batteries just with these strings/rope or is there something more?

I believe if there was a way to tighten the plates with screws, it should be pretty durable / strong.

At least more stronger, belief/impression wise, than it looks now with the strings/ropes which might not hold into place all the time, I think :)

I would think of using some strong rubber bands. And big ass shrink tubes. Not in this order obviously :slight_smile:

@solarcross this is a great concept and you've got some serious tape skills! I think that we need more options for developing battery packs without a spot-welder, since many folks don't have (or want) one. I know for myself I bought a low-cost spot welder and I've used it a few times to make packs, but honestly it just sorta sits there looking cool and not being used a lot.

Cool concept, I'm anxious to see more. I've always wanted to make a pack out with easily swappable cells by using battery holders like [these.](http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/DIY-Black-Storage-Box-Holder-Case-For-4-x-18650-3-7V-Rechargeable-Batteries/301622376994?_trksid=p2047675.c100005.m1851&_trkparms=aid%3D222007%26algo%3DSIC.MBE%26ao%3D2%26asc%3D38661%26meid%3D61f5db4678fd4dd6968eb419a77752b3%26pid%3D100005%26rk%3D1%26rkt%3D6%26sd%3D182410501710)

some improvements I plan on making
conductive grease
individual cell level fusing for thermal runway.. but Im reading the failure rate of 18650 is 0.00001%.. 

 Points brought out by another forum...
 fish paper - gasket material any place a wire comes in close contact with the cell can.. 
Maybe use fibreglass circuit board chunks instead of wood.. file down edges..

 So Ive been using the pack for 2 weeks without issue.. However I want to try and see If I can bring the IR down to Nanotech battery levels... which is 1 Ohm.. My pack with just bare wire pressed against the cell is ranging from 7-11 Ohms..I will be trying a silver based product...

Are those wires copper?  They look like aluminum. That's an easy drop in resistance.

  Well the wire is from hobbyking and it is high strand core tinned copper
I used 16awg for the cell connections which is good for 35Amps, then 14awg for the + and - leads which is good for 55.6Amps... probably could get away with using 18 or 20awg for the cell connections..

  The silver based product I found is corrosion resistant and adheres to aluminum and copper and has a volume resistivity of just 0.0001 Ohms-cm 
 - compared to Nickel @ 0.0068 Ohms-cm and Carbon @ 0.46 Ohms-cm

I havent rebuilt it yet using the silver product...hopefully soon !!
because the pack is working without any issues.. which is a good right!!

Anyhow.. I have found a source for 3.45Ah cells from a 2016 Tesla 90D with only 5k.. The previous generation Tesla cells were 3.2Ah and have minimal capacity loss and 1000-2000 of cycle life...

Will probably try to arrange a Canadian group buy for the cells in two weeks time..
so far Ive been quoted $3.59 per cell in 150 qty.

Seems dangerous and like more work than it's worth.

For my latest battery pack, I calculated the amount of copper I need in a strip to get the same as a 10 awg, and came up with 20mm wide of .4 thick copper sheets. I could solder a cell in under 3 seconds, cells never even really got warm, so I doubt theres any damage. It keeps packs super thin still also. Took maybe 4 hours to do a 12s4p including cutting and shaping the copper and adding balance wires.

Just seems like theres safer options... You don't need to be a jerk with Will either, he's a nice guy, always very active and trying to help. He wasn't trying to be a dick.

Hello guys.  I'm from Brazil and I'm communicating with you using an automatic translator.  Weird words may appear.
I already thought of something similar to this not for the cost, but to protect the soldering cells from tin and to facilitate the exchange of a cell that has problem.
I was excited because you were successful in your experience.  I even suggest improvements in this technique.
In addition to using polyacrylamide tape as a colleague suggested before, use a ball made of aluminum foil at the point of the wire at each pole of the cells.  This will increase the contact surface and allow more efficient electrical conduction, further reducing the risk of heating.  With these two materials this technique will be very robust!


Thanks for sharing!
