[**Haggyboard**](https://haggyboard.com/),

We spoke about them in the Metasurf topic, I don't find a topic on them (I don't work or anything with them, just sharing their stuff),
and I already fall in love with this wheel (and ask for them, waiting for the end of the month now).

Yes they are, I have been talking to the owner for the past week, he is currently on holiday until the end of the month.

He aims that his off-road wheels will be done mid November

His wheels are made by labeda 

And his trucks have a 12mm stepped down to 10mm

His pulleys are only designed for his trucks

that's good to hear; thanks my friend.  

Please let him or her know that I tried to order the Haggy Drive kit for five bones or whatever it was (the one in stock) and their checkout failed last week.

I then sent an email to both of the hello@wertrimo.com and support@wertrimo addresses asking for support, and both bounced.

I've seen these wheels in Oz before and never knew who made them.  They looked perfect.

Maybe they're different. Mine are 125mm. But they're haggy boards.

Edit: Got them from a forum member 2 years ago, he was in Taiwan and was moving to Europe. 

I was looking for the company then but couldn't find anything about them, til recently.

hummm, yes maybe, regarding to your photo and the new Haggy wheels 125 vs 150mm, and the tire doesn't look bigger, so I guess the rim/hub is smaller too ....

ok thanks !

That's all I got. My calipers are somewhere, not sure where. 

It says 125 on the tires but they're over 5 inches. Idk exactly how that works.

dear all,
sorry for my late reply and also many thanks for having set up this thread and thanks for your interest in our components.

Let me clarify a few things:

- unfortunately the email address "hello@wertrimo.com" and "support@wertrimo.com" bounced but this has been fixed now. Alternatively I am also available on the app LINE under the nick "haggy.haggy".

- @DilatedPupils received from me a prototype (3-spoke)  wheel quite some time ago. The actual tire was made and designed by Evolve. We did not develop this tire and I received it from China. In the meantime we have fine-tuned our 3-spoke rims and also set up our own mould with Innova Taiwan for our tire. All tires have been finished and are ready in our little warehouse. Our tires are completely different to those from Evolve. The new Bergmeister wheels when fully inflated measure 150mm in diameter. I usually have them pumped to 80psi.

- I am waiting for our manufacturer to finish our rims and I expect them to be ready by mid-November. By that I mean that they are ready to be sent out to anybody who wants them. 

- I would be more than happy to send you detailed pictures of all our components. If you have any questions, please send via this forum or via email. 

My apologies if the reply is not instantaneous as I am travelling now and will only be back in Taiwan around Oct. 24th. 

Best regards
Timo

On your Kahua trucks, under CONTENTS it says: " 1x set of **Kahua trucks** (front & back) with dual motor mounts incl. all hardware and bushings". Does that mean that motor mounts are included? because I don't see them in photos nor sold separately. thanks!

not gonna lie dude. I am extremely jealous. My dream right now is 5 inch nummies on my carvon torque drives. 
6 inch on a dual setup might be too big but 5 would be perfect.

@DilatedPupils :dizzy_face: what Im looking now :star_struck: !!!
125mm for real, yes now that remind me Eric from esk8fr forum that ride them when the carbon GT was out ! They got a 150mm set never sold, and they propose 175mm finally on the GT serie. 

@mutantbass ,.. I still stock now. Why we didn't could find any wheel, tire or rim like this in this world !? 
I will love to get them even smaller :heart_eyes: ....

@topcloud :scream: 125 x **50** !? !  Hell Yeeeaaaaaah !!! (I only find 5x1" like links above/upper)
If a shop get some I take 4 of them !

@Tinp123 Motor mount only to sell with the truck as a pack I guess..

Hi @riverside.rider,

Are your new rims for the 150mm tyres the same size as the prototypes you used with the 125mm tyre?  Is it just the tyre size that is different or are the rims completely different? 

Can you provide a price for a full set of 150mm wheels?

Cheers,
Patrick

This were made by Evolve and seemed they tried this standar, but weren't happy with the results. @okp himself (Ribert Cédric from Unik) is the one holding the tires in those images. He said he received the tires from an Evolve distributor in France. He doesn't know what happened with this project.

thanks mate ! my family name is Ribert ;) but you got my surname spot on ! Cédric

Yeah I think it was back in 2015 or 16 when I did the review and gave the Carbon GT a ride in Paris, the french Evolve distributor (he's a really nice guy but too much locked with Jeff which I can understand, so he has very limited freedom to express which have created a bit tension in our relation the past years) shared with me this set of hubs wheels. Evolve was looking to produce them but they stopped. I assume because they didn't match something sustainable when their plan was to streamline and reuse everything to make money. So they were not at all in the "custom" or "parts" area but under development. 

I shared them with a friend and he was happy with them and then gave them back. I've paused the battery mods on Evolve boards (too much time, not at all a good financial model - Evolve customers don't care about paying 500 euros for a bad battery pack directly from Evolve but are still reluctant to give 400 USD to a one man army guy that does it after his job in quality to help them) as I found so crazy electronics weird stuff into them, but I have to admit that I really like their spoke hubs. It's Nylon glass fiber reinforced right? anyone has  a clue?

Cheers all!

Hi @Pmac,
yes, our 150mm tires are he same as the prototypes we used for the 125mm tires. The tire size (exterior diameter) is slightly different, the interior diameter is the same. A full set of 150mm Bergmeister wheels is USD 215,-. (TWD 6650).
This is just an estimate cost and I am trying to offer them below USD 200, give me some time and I will post the info on this thread, once the cost is fixed.

best regards
Timo

Hi @riverside.rider
Really interesting products. Do you know if there are any reviews/written user experiences of the trucks and motors for example? Also will you be selling a complete drive system with just the pneumatic wheels (no Senor Pepes)?

PS. Based on your name I'd guess you have roots in Finland maybe?

Hi @pixelsilva
yes, I confirm that these tires fit with the Bergmeister rims. But you may wanna check with the producer, if they are actually allowed to sell the tires. I take it that Evolve paid for the moulding cost of this specific tire. 
Anyhow, what I can do is to put on my website the rims separately, if there is a demand.

Hi @jaatis, actually I have no idea why my parents named me Timo......I am Swiss and never been too Finland...still a place on my to-do list though.

Yes, I can also put on the website just the complete drive with the Bergmeister wheels. No problem. I ll do that once I am back in the office.

Hi @Tinp123, I have corrected the entry on the website. The motor mounts are not included in the Kahua trucks. The reason for this is that the motor mounts are made to specifically match our motors (in regards to the shaft length), which match the wheel pulleys. So if you are interested in the trucks, they would come without the mounts...if you are interested in the mounts too, then you could go for the complete set.

Hi @Pedrodemio,
please refer to the below technical drawings :slight_smile:!
Let me know if you have any questions. we have tested them and they remain tightly connected when riding rough terrain (vibration). Also, they can be easily integrated into an enclosure...there  is a silicone o-ring included so as to make the connector water resistant.![15|690x474](upload://2k8ycex7qfnbE9yOGk6J50uDLdv.jpeg) ![48|690x472](upload://ojYLYAAsX7bABwWGVMyy3ECAuHS.jpeg)

Nice!. Your render settings seem to be much better than mine - I can never get it right anymore.

I have designed a 3 gear system for 80-107mm wheels like Kegels and Flywheels. Most of the concept was applied to the design that I just did for the Haggyboard offroaders and even use some parts. For example a bearing shaft and the clamp for the truck.

The wheel gear has an integrated bearing 
The gears are 12mm wide
3:1 gear ratio

I still got some cheap "driver" to custom for a test  (too bad it's m1.5 44T, I will ship them to you for testing...)
It should be easily custom on a lathe, I guess, maybe cheaper than making one from a peace a material ...
https://monlongboardelectrique.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/img_20171115_151629l.jpg

Your 2 stages gear sound just so good, when I was modeling this (but normal 1 stage) I didn't find to good compromise cause of the small wheel (and want good clearance).
It's why I pass to Gummies (hope it's not a bad choice).
https://monlongboardelectrique.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/img_20171114_131109l.jpg
At the same time, I was selling the dual hub/esc/remote of Maytech, cause of lack of power...
So when I get my Gummies, I see immediately what I got to do : make from them a new bigger powerfull Maytech 9055 hub like, but in 125-75 DIY way :smile: 

I will make those hubs now I start it just for me for science and maybe see to rework on a GD for the future air tire setup (before to make my hub for air tire that I start more than a year ago)

@Pedrodemio: Good morning. I am using Shopify for the webshop and calculating transportation costs is rather rigid and does not allow for much customisation. What I can do is to check for cost of posting the cables in a simple envelope. I believe the cost would be greatly reduced. Let me get back to you on that once back in the office.

@sofu: Good morning. I left early next morning when you arrived in Taipei. Next time you are in Taiwan, you are more than welcome to pop by the office. You asked if I would be selling the motors without the rest of the drivetrain. At the moment I won't be doing that because right now most of the motors in stock are already built into the drive trains. If I see that the drivetrains (with the Bergmeister pneumatic wheels) sell well, then I will make a follow up order of motors and can consider selling them separately. There will however be some changes to the motors, particularly to the sensor wires. All new motors will come with the sensor adapters (https://haggyboard.com/collections/connectors/products/vibration-proof-6-pin-sensor-connector-compatible-with-vesc-based-escs) included. All going well, I could have motors back either just before or just after Chinese New Year. I shall keep you posted.

@moon: impressive work! will you be using an o-ring around the wheel pulley to keep the luberication / oil inside the casing?

Besides, we are based in Taiwan and so is Innova.

@LukePL: As far as I know Innova is not selling on Alibaba...if you see companies selling Innova branded tires they may either be legit resellers for the standardised tires or fakes. If you purchase from Alibaba you may wish to take into consideration that a lot of companies (tire producers) use chemicals to treat their rubber / nylon compounds that are carcinogenic. So be careful when you buy on Alibaba.

As for chemicals you are right. I bought well known 6 inch tire on Aliexpress. Unpack it and touch my face around eye with the same hand that I hold tire. Immediately my eye start to burn and turn red. I washed this tire with water and mild detergent and after that it was ok. For sure some bad chemicals.

There is so much going on in China that just baffles me (in a positive and in a negative way)...good luck! If I can be of assistance, let me know.

The way the motor is mounted and how the tensioning work is also quite cool.

Hello everybody,
thanks for the above comments, much appreciated indeed. Also my apologies for this rather late update on the Bergmeister pneumatics status:

So here we go:
- I expect our wheels to be ready for shipment by either this upcoming Friday or Saturday. 
- The website will be updated with all the relevant information within this week.
- There will be the following rim colors to choose from:

Sandblasted black matte
Sandblasted red matte
Sandblasted blue matte
Sandblasted shiny silver

If you purchase the wheel set without the motors and the Kahua trucks, you would need to machine your own pulley. On our website there is a free to download .stp file for a universal 60T / 15mm wide pulley that should work with most kind of longboard trucks out there. 

We recommend to have the pulley CNC milled rather than 3d printed. But that of course depends on the type of filament. Given that it is a .stp file, you can also freely modify the pulley to your liking.

If there is a general acceptance of this specific universal pulley, we can also have a mould made for it, which means that we can produce it with nylon/glass fibre via injection process (just like our 36T pulleys)

Feel free to ask me any questions on here or via email.

Thanks,
Timo

@Maxid: Hi Daniel, the reason why the 60T drive gear / pulley won't work is because it comes with an integrated 6001 type bearing. This bearing has an inner diameter of 12mm and this particular pulley is specifically made to fit our Kahua trucks. Our trucks come with a screw in axle that is "stepped" from 12mm (area where the pulley bearing sits on) down to 8mm where the wheel bearings sit (which are the standard 608mm type bearings). 

You can see that the universal pulley design to download does not have a bearing, so this makes it universal in that it can be used with most longboard trucks. That pulley is screwed onto the wheel's rim.

Hope that the above helped to clarify this.

Thanks,
Timo

28mm seems quite large OD - so might fit around calibers (and TBs for that matter)

Edit: ah I see without the bearing there is nothing actually holding the pulley in place - clever design - just like the push on kegel pulleys etc.
Next step: finding a bearing with OD 28mm and 8mm ID :D 

@riverside.rider: how long does the axle need to be to use it with a bearing?
```

---
## \#91 Posted by: riverside.rider Posted at: 2018-11-19T16:44:30.477Z Reads: 210

```
@Maxid: No, this will not work, because the pulley would need to be screwed to the rim if there is no bearing inside the pulley.

Essentially there are two systems:

a) Using screws for rim/pulley connection: this will only work with the downloadable pulley design

b) Using no screws for the rim / pulley connection: this will only work with the integrated bearing inside the pulley and only the Kahua trucks will work with this.
The 6001 bearing pushes against the hanger and the rim pushes against the pulley...so it is a tight connection. If you do not have the bearing inside the pulley, then you have nothing to push the pulley against the rim.

Not sure if the above makes sense? I ll make a video tomorrow to show exactly what I mean. it is 00:44 here and my brain is half asleep.

good night everyone,
Timo

@Maxid: yes you are right: 638 works perfectly. In the picture below you can see it: brown = 6001 // silver = 638
the total axle length required would be 65mm. However, I strongly advise against using an exposed 65mm axle that is 8mm in diameter.

So I got the new tires from @riverside.rider. They are not that much different from the 5 inch evolve tires.

I haven't had a chance to test it yet, weather and life kinda gets in they way of riding.

Plus the black/grey mate is really good, they're solid in hand, I love the design of rim and tires. I'm taking more photos.
Just waiting for some sprocket, they should arrive during the next week I guess and some DIY to go before a test ride ...

Hi @mutantbass: This is the first big batch that we have ordered from our CNC milling shop and I have asked them to individually check each and every single rim before delivering to me, with particular focus on the bearing seat. This has taken much longer time than anticipated, unfortunately. 
They finished and packed everything now and I should have everything in stock by Monday. I will then check everything myself again and do the first wheel assemblies starting Monday. All going well the wheels will be ready for sale on either Tuesday or Wednesday. 
We do not wish to sell anything that we do not have in stock and ready for immediate shipping, that's why there is no possibility of pre-ordering. Again sorry for all the delays...but we take it step by step.

Do your trucks come with motor mounts?
Really interested in experimenting with your trucks and mounts!

Would you be able to make shorter axles? Thinking about maybe using the trucks for a hub motor design! I'm so excited you have no idea lol

So nice and good to read you Timo :pray:

Effectively, the wheels, the rims/hub looks perfectly clean, 
and the bearing go right in place without difficulty and with the perfect fit !

I got an idea for the quick testing setup, I will start posting soon, today it's house-warming !!! :blush:

I would go with the [universal driver 60t adapter for belt drive system screwed directly onto the Bergmeister All-terrain pneumatic wheel](https://haggyboard.com/collections/drive-gears/products/universal-60t-adapter) gently shared by Timo.
But it's around 50€/pcs for the driver. And I just want to make a test before to get the GD prototype ready.

So to could ride them ASAP, I will start with a cheap but super strong and easy, chain setup (the dual should cost less than a few 10€ of sprocket for a quattro + a 3D print spacer adapter) : 
https://amadridefr.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/26t_drive.jpg

Plus I design it more compact than the belt drive, for my need (light dual setup, 5065 140kv).
I'm finishing the GD system to fit them, it will be even more compact than belt or chain drive system with a better clearance to the ground :blush: Of curse I will share all with you :v:

@PXSS Hi Patrick, the motor mounts only come with the full Haggy Drive System set which would include the motors and pulleys of course.
We do not include the motor mounts for those that wish to just purchase the Kahua trucks. The reason for this is: the motor mounts require a very specific motor shaft length to match with the drive pulleys. So the idea is to sell the Kahua trucks to be used for either hub motors or a self developed motor mount.
Yes, we could shorten the axles, but I would need to know what length and diameter you would require (max diameter 12mm).
Let me know what you think and perhaps we can find a solution.
thanks
Timo

Hey Tyson,
I got them from tridistribution.fr
I used to drive board with chain since 2015 and even more since 2016/2017 on my Darth Vapor setup.
I love the freewheel, torque, noize and low maintenance of them. (I try again belt on my last build and it failed in under 5km ... So back to basics :smile:) 

I will share the 3D folder to make the centered holes patterns if there are any interest.
Something like that I guess (Im trying to rebuild my printer before) :

Dear all,

finally, the second bigger batch for the CNC machined rims has arrived. They come in 4 different flavours:

**- sandblasted and black anodised (matte)**

**- sandblasted and red anodised (matte)**

**- sandblasted and blue anodised (matte)**

**- sandblasted and silver anodised (shiny)**

(The colours may look differently under different lighting conditions, but colours are as per below pictures)

Here are some points that I would like to highlight:

- this batch is bigger than the first one but not massively big and stocks are limited. The next big batch (batch number three) will be ready by mid January 2019

- we are always supportive of group buys, but can only arrange them for the next batch mid January. We can always discuss pricing depending on the order qty.

- for group buys of min. 15 sets ( 1 set = 4 wheels), we can arrange custom anodising.

- the website will be updated Wednesday-Thursday and the cost per set will be the equivalent TWD 6600,- which is about USD 213,-

- when purchased from the website, free shipping will only apply with a total purchase amount of the equivalent of USD 300,- and above. For this you would need to use the code “ **FREESHIPPING** ” a the checkout.

=======================

For members of this great forum, I would like to offer a special discount (which will not be displayed on the website):

**The offer is:**

- 1 set of complete Bergmeister pneumatic wheels incl. bearing spacer and extra 35mm bolts and nuts (that can be used to attach your own pulley)

- 1 set of extra inner tubes for the Bergmeister pneumatics (1 set = 4 inner tubes)

- 1 set of 90mm Senor Pepe wheels incl. bearing spacer (1 set = 4 wheels)

- 1 set of 6pin JST esc connectors (1 set = 2 cables to be used on a dual motor setup)

**- Free shipping**

**- USD 285,- // TWD 8800,-**

=======================

**Please take note of the following:**

- this offer is strictly limited to this current batch and only while stocks last. A certain number of Bergmeister sets will be reserved for the Haggy Drive System 2-in-1

- basis first come first serve // this offer is valid for one single order

- as mentioned before, this offer will not be published on the website and is exclusively for members of this forum

- If you are interested, please send me an email to  **timo@wertrimo.com**  with your username in the forum, the preferred rim color, full contact details (name, address, phone number) and your PayPal account email.

- An invoice with a payment request will be sent to you.  **DO NOT**  use “friends and family" when paying via PayPal. I will cover the fees and this serves as your own protection.

- Upon receipt of the funds, shipment will be arranged within 1-2 working days and I will then send you by email the tracking number (EMS courier) as well as a copy of the postage payment receipt

=======================

**Compatible pulleys for the Bergmeister pneumatics:**

- you can download here (https://haggyboard.com/products/universal-60t-adapter) a free .stp file for a 60T // 15mm wide universal pulley compatible with the Bergmeister rim. Feel free to modify (and share) this pulley to fit your needs.

-  **@Riako**  has done some great modifications to this pulley, also for use with chains. I am sure he will be happy to help in case you got questions, so am I. If there is demand for a preferred pulley design, we can arrange to have it either injection moulded or CNC milled in the future

=======================

We are always happy to get feedback from the community. Our tire maker INNOVA here in Taiwan has been extremely helpful and cooperative and for the future we are also looking at making the same tire style,  just with different compounds. So plenty of things to come in the future. 

Looking forward to hearing from you,

Timo (@riverside.rider)

@skunk: Hi Kelly. The pulleys that you see on the website only work with he Kahua trucks, as they are press-fit pulleys (without any screws) and come with an integrated 12mm diameter 6001 type bearings inside the pulley. That only works because we have a stepped down (12mm for pulley area down to 8mm where the wheel bearings sit (608 type). So in short....bad idea to get our pulleys if you don't use the Kahua truck.

@skunk: which type of bearings do you? what is the entire axle length? for our pulleys to work on your axle, you would need an axle length of approx. 65mm.  I consider this to be a bit iffy for 8mm axle diameter and even 10mm.

 axle and the part of the axle outside of the hanger is  65mm long. The part that is 12mm in diameter is 30mm long (where the bearing pulley 6001 sits) and the area that is 8mm in diameter is 35mm long (where the wheel bearings sit 608).

@skunk: hi there. So I have some good news. My local bearing supplier has a bearing that has the same outer dimensions as the 6001 type bearing we use, with the small difference that it is 10mm inner diameter (instead of the 12mm for the 6001). The bearing goes by the identifier 6100.2Z
It seems to me that this could very well work with the 10mm Surfrodz. I will be sending you tomorrow 1x pulley for the 36T Kegel core, 1x pulley for the 36T ABEC 11 flywheels and 1x pulley for the 60T Bergmeister (incl. wheel). I would greatly appreciate if you could check if all fits on your Surfrodz.

@Riako what size spacer is required between the wheel bearing and pulley bearing?

Hey Cort,
You should use an 3mm spacer actually ;) (or like 3 x 1mm speedring - but the stl folder is still in improvement ).

About that, as Timo says
[quote="riverside.rider, post:50, topic:76241"]
There are now some fine adjustments being made and I will update you once everything has been fully tested and is ready for download.
[/quote]
Its a part of the adjustment, as I 1st would like to make it simple, in just one piece.
He tested the 1st version with a Taiwan esk8 squad rider, it fits perfectly, just this little gap to complete.
But reading you make me doubt about the one piece system, cause the axle is not stepped like the Kahua (so the wheel is directly pressed against the shoulder of the diameter change), and there will be a lot of force exercised on the plastic/alloy piece. There are 3 areas that the driver support against the wheel rim at different heights: the inner bearing area, the screw spacer and the external/outer flank of the rim.

![gear%20v30|690x388](upload://ibLdESYbILUjpf39AOUNuWegbJf.jpeg) 
Maybe it's more doable with a CNC alloy type driver ...
What do you think guys?

Not ridden the trucks yet ... But they're wide, looks super strong and for the wheels, they are really good on all surfaces/weather (mostly ridden around 5/0°C on AT for me). 
I think the motor has changed now, what I can tell it's all smell pretty good and Timo is like a communication Boss if you need anything ;)

Hi Justin
Don’t pull the trigger jet. There will be some exciting new rim colors to choose from. I expect to receive them within the next 7 working days.
;-)
For the time being we are keeping the 6364 motors (same manufacturer as sk3 ) but for the future we will upgrade to 6374. 
if you are unhappy with the current motors, they can easily be changed with the newer ones at a later stage. 
If U have any questions let me know.

Regards
Timo

Hi @jneumann. I have not yet had the pleasure of riding an Evolve gt, but i think in General terms it would be better to also take into consideration the battery used when comparing motors. 10s vs 12s is a complete different experience. 
The motors we are using are rated for  190kv and I ride them on 10s configuration. I will do some comparisons with other manufacturers once I have a bit more time on my hands....but for now I can say that 190kv 6364 motors with 15:36 (90mm wheel) or 15:60 (147mm wheel) pack a punch :-)

you try to compare 5065 motor (gt) with 6364 (Haggy) ... I don't think it is necessary ^^ 
I have already set and run SK8 3674 130kV from HK and there are bigger powerful nothing to compare with 50mm motor.

It's exactly what I'm gonna do this WE, swapping those little 5065 140kv + chain with the Haggy kit 2 in 1 :

Hi @riverside.rider,

I'm sourcing parts for my hybrid build (Street/AT) and I would like to know few things about your parts. As I didn't find any answer on this thread, here are my questions :

1/ Do you know if the Bergmeister tires (145mm) and inner tube you sell would fit the Sixshooter [hubs](https://psychotiller.com/product/6-billet-wheel-hubs) from @psychotiller ?
2/ Same thing with @marcmt88 [hubs](https://www.janux-esk8.com/product-page/6-x2-pneumatic-tires-and-hubs) ? Edit : Find [an answer](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/bergmeister-tyres-on-aliexpress-s-6x2-wheels/80789/2) for this question.

I hope my inquiries are not misplaced, Timo, but I like your work and the one from thoses guys as well (Dave's and Marc's). My plan is to buy something of all of you but I first need to know what is possible and compatible.
```

Hi  @Slak,
all questions are welcomed and i would be very happy to answer them ..(if i can).
I do not know if the Bergmeister tires fit on the sixshooter hubs nor on the  @marcmt88

but let me check with a guy on the French forum. I think I have seen him using six shooters and the Bergmeister tires.

@mmaner Hi Mike,
the 6364 190kv motors are only sold in the complete Haggy Drive System Set. They are not sold separately. 
But we are now working on a 6364 motor that will be sold separately and can be used on both the Haggy Drive System as well as the AVIO AT gear drive.
Given Chinese New Year on our door step, I expect the motors to be ready for purchase in the first half of March..possibly earlier.
(unit costs of the motors will make you drool though...in a positive way :slight_smile:  )

@riverside.rider I have a few questions.

Do you have updates on the bigger motors? That's one of the things that stopped me from buying the 2 in 1 kit before. I already have 6374 motors on other builds so it's hard to go down now. If not are you willing to sell the kit without the motors so I can source bigger ones myself?

Do you have bigger wheel pulleys so I can use with larger wheels (e.g.: 110 TB wheels) and maintain the same ratio?

I'm looking at the way the motor arm attaches to the truck and it seems to be a smooth round "c-clamp" style attachment system that gets tightened by a bolt. Is that reliable enough to keep the arms from moving even after hundreds of kms?

Thanks!

I see. In the first picture looked really low. Well the space underneath is enough but I guess you have some flex there. You could think about vacuum forming or thermoforming ABS/kidex. They allow quite some flex. Looking at your build to me you need to make slimmer the battery enclosure. Everything is so slick. Maybe use more smaller lipos or make a liion battery.

Idea v4.5 mount for ats12 trucks. Lots of places to bolt on to which is nice.

Trying to get the bolt pattern of the crossbar bolts is quite annoying. Seems the easiest place to mount to though.

I'm sure @Idea could share a simple screen-print of the drawing, face view, and I can adapt it to it ! (sorry if my frenglish is not clear ^^)
