Let me pre-empt what I’m about to say with this. I accept that I made a mistake trusting someone I have never met and barely know of. PayPal Friends and Family should be for just that, Friends and Family. So I take full responsibility for that part of this and I’ll accept the lost. That being said, of someone offers you goods and services, and you pay the as expected then they in turn should return the favor and deliver on said goods and services. That was not the case in my dealings with Kevin Dark. He’s taken me for quite a ride and has taught me a lot about dealing with folks here, lessons I won’t soon forget. I am posting this to warn others, especially if you’re not in the UK or Europe in general, that you should be weary of anything he promises. I’m sure others have had a positive experience with him, as that is why I ultimately decided to do business with him, but I have now come to regret it and only want to warn others. I’m not the only who has a story like this, at least 2 others have contacted me about similar experiences. I know I’m not big here or a builder, but just about any member of the NYC Eboarding Collective can tell you that I’m a honest guy, nice to a fault, and trustworthy, and I would not do anything like this if it wasn’t warranted. In fact, I hesitate as I write this, but after 4 months, a lost deposit, and no battery to show for it, this is to be done.

I ordered a battery from him February 11th and today, June 11th, I still have not received anything but empty promises and excuses. First he missed his own stated turnaround time of 14-21 days, then claimed he sent a battery that he had not even started building. When he finally claims he has mailed it, it got “lost” and I never received anything. I asked him for a refund multiple times but he has declined. I asked him for replacement pack, but he declined that as well. He has been less than upfront about the whereabouts of my pack and has shown little to no interest in resolving this issue. I had to constantly reach out to him for updates while continues to take new orders and post on Facebook about building batteries. Please be aware of the kind of service he provides. He believes he is doing you a favor by rescuing you from your “shitty evolve battery”, but it sure doesn’t feel like a favor at all.

Says because it was a battery, that he couldn’t insure for the full amount. Had to call it something else and only insured it up to 100 pounds

:no_mouth:

Possibility they seized the package when they found out it was a battery. In most cases it's illegal to send lithium ion battery packs so what ever service he was using was most likely against sending liion batteries but he lied to them so he could send it. And then also lied about the item value

No one is trying to hide anything just people tend to get a bit uppity with their orders at times and 'vendor bashing' isn't allowed without warrant (in this case maybe warranted given it is coming up from more than one buyer)... that said darkkevin did respond to the other thread

Also to add to that. I went to battle for everyone on this forum before. 

https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/vendor-complaints-versus-design-discussion/39459

There are reasons it's not allowed on the forums. However

There are also prime examples when this has been allowed, because there are scammers here. 

As I said before AATorque Systems aka alextech..Bimmer being the lastest goodie..  there are a few others I am missing. 

It's not to hide anything, it's to keep the community from spiraling out of control. When there is actual merit to people concerns. You will see that these discussions have been left open in the past. But circumstances must be of benefit to everyone here..

Step 3: raise holy hell when it doesn't show up, burn the place down, beat each other up.

This person's order has been fulfilled, however, the courier have lost track of the parcel and is under investigation by them.

He thinks I'm trying to dupe him out of his money, why would I ruin my reputation with such an act?

@Battosaii your friend is getting his refund imminently as I promised him within the week... People are sometimes so impatient!

 @Maxaweli as I've previously told you, I don't have the kind of cash where I can just make you another battery and send it to you like you've stupidly suggested. I'm not a company I don't have a business account or petty cash to dip in to, I'm an individual doing people who can't build their own batteries a favour. For very little recompense!

Right now the courier company are investigating the loss... What else can I do except wait to see what comes of it!?

As a moderator who has dealt with several members frustrated with our policy on these kinds of circumstances, I can confidently say that it was not created to hide behind or to protect any vendors, but rather to keep this forum a positive place. Despite the PSA that I posted a while back, it seems a lot of people insist on using the friends and family option in PayPal because either the vendor asks for it or the customer doesn’t want to pay that extra 3%. Nobody on this forum is at fault for that, and the negative energy that is spread when things go south after loss of $$$ due to this kind of scenario is something that we’d like to avoid here. So - I’ll say the same thing that I’ll always say:

I’m sorry that this happened, I agree that it’s unfortunate, and at the same time I hope that everyone can see it as a learning experience. The situation itself however needs to be dealt with privately - I’m sure that this has gotten Kevin’s attention.

Please don’t use Friends and Family. I’ll leave it up to my fellow moderators as to whether or not we want to close this thread.

It’s not a stupid suggestion. Especially if its been a long time since you promised delivery. I think that’s an adequate request. But the evidence is in my other post that was released. So people can judge for themselves, which all I want. We should be informed consumers, I wish I was.

People contact you. They give you money to buy the goods. Your service is building the battery. 

Take your service out, and you become a middle man. But being as the battery doesn't put itself together, and that is your service that you are selling. Yep. Vendor

I did group buys on remotes. I needed to ship them out myself ...even tho I didn’t make any money...I considered myself a Vendor...

I provided a service. I took in Money. They expect delivery of item.

There is no doubt as an individual providing a service is like being in a one man band at a rock festival. We have seen varying degrees of it with all the companies here and individuals...Shit does happen that can throw a person such as yourself in to an unfavorable light...like shipping batteries....let the big boys figure out shipping batteries internationally ... my two cents

So now that everyone has spoken their peace.

@darkkevind

You take care of  
@Powadangaboards yet?

What about this guy who still hasn't gotten his battery ( @Maxaweli )?

You obviously just refunded another unnamed customer. Maybe you should stop selling stuff until you catch up, and can make things right with all of your waiting customers.

Maybe there should be a PSA sent to PayPal so your funds are all frozen? 

I'm not trying to be mean, but you obviously need to be a little more realistic, not only with your customers, but with yourself and your capability.

Not only that, but you are putting your own family at risk, providing a service as a person and not under an LLC. Please wisen up, if not for your customers, but for your children. Again don't take that the wrong way, I would never threaten anyone. But I never want to hear about parents making bad decisions that could affect a child's future provisions(stable household monetarily etc). You obviously care about them, as you mention them in your posts. So do what a real dad should do, and separate your business from your personal entity, especially selling goods that can burn people's houses down and not holding insurance.

From my detective work, I believe the battery was sent with Parcel2Go.com and there list of prohibited items can be found [here](https://www.parcel2go.com/prohibited-items).

If I've learnt nothing else lately it's don't use parcel2go.
I have a parcel I sent to the US 19 days ago on a 3 day service. (£28 for the pleasure) 
Still not received and Parcel2go who don't have a phone number keep fobbing me off every day when they reply to my messages after over 24hr each time...
It's not a battery..

If you make a battery for someone once, then sure; you're an individual helping someone out. 

If you're advertising about your services, getting more and more "orders", struggling to finish the orders "on time" and still having new orders coming in, having significant amounts of money getting in and out of your bank account (I mean, more than shipping costs for free 3d prints), aso, then things have gotten a bit more complicated, and one can no longer argue that you're just an individual randomly helping a brother in need.. No?

Man we definitely have a worldwide battery shipping problem especially if you are an individual....

Definitely need to make sure that battery creation and servicing by individual service providers be done by someone In your country or trading region to avoid these problems with shipping internationally.

Obviously...the main Esk8 players have thier own network or policies that are in place yo help you.

@darkkevind If you are shipping battery at te international level without the proper paperwork or certification, if you have to lie on the shipping receipt in order to get your stuff ship... Then it is not up to your customer to pay for your mistake... It is all on you Man, you took the risk, and you knew the possible outcome

Sorry about that

Just seeing people offer services they cannot fullfil really flabbergasts me.

It is the sellers responsibility after payment is made to not only make the goods but to deliver the goods. It should not be on the buyer to receive the goods. If he knowing miss labels or under insures to save a buck I think it is on the seller to make it right if something goes wrong.

If you cannot do this then don't offer your services.

Ok, firstly, @Maxaweli I've already told you I'm waiting until the parcel company complete their investigation before making any decision...

The parcel has been misplaced/lost by the courier... for now or forever, we don't know. If they find it, it'll be on it's way to you again, if they don't well then that's on me and you'll get your money back.

This doesn't have anything to do with the contents, labelling or initial shipping company, it's simply been lost and is trying to be located.

@Deckoz please don't patronise me and try to tell me how to live my life or run my family.

@Powadangaboards has been refunded in full and has a screen grab from paypal to prove it. Whether or not it has hit his account yet is not my problem.

@JohnnyMeduse if I don't refer to them as 'customer' for everyone to easily understand who I'm referring to then how should I refer to them? "Guy who ordered a battery from me"?

No I'm not licensed, of course not, I'm a hobbyist, and I absolutely don't plan on doing this for much longer than people want cheap batteries. I'm definitely done with this shit within 6 months.
No, not all of the parcels are sent legally, if they were people would be paying nearly £200 for shipping! This puts batteries out of many people's budget. Any European order is ground shipped.
My prices are mega low because I want to help people get batteries, not rip them off or make a profit. I have a decent paying day job, this is not a job for me or a viable income.

My point is, people who order from me know all this.

This thread is important for the community and everyone making /sending /receiving batteries. We need to become aware and learn from this. 

This thread shouldn't be about Kevin. It should be about raising awareness about what we are dealing with and how to do things properly in the first place, cause these things will definitely happen again and again if nothing changes, no matter who's the "battery guy of the day".

Batteries are not cheap for a reason people selling them need to cover costs and expenses like paying for legal help for setting up a business or accountants to do your taxes or for insurance (or losses due to shipping).  I ran my own small business for the last 5 years (web dev) and while not wildly successful at developing the business I still did things legitimately for my customers and myself.  Setting up an LLC at least in the US is a pretty simple task and separates your business liability from your personal liability in case of lawsuits or other major fines happen due to the business.  Think you're taking the advise from deckoz too personally, it is good advise (seems you are getting defensive of people who are mostly "on your side" or at least neutral on the matter).

You say you will only do this until there is no demand, but I don't know that day will ever come.

but instead I thought them how to make introduce our forums and couple vendor to start with.Because I'm hobbist.

Dude the fact that you have yet to accept any fault in this speaks volumes. Stop taking new orders when you having existing orders, stop promising a turnaround time you know you can’t fulfill, stop saying you’re doing ppl a favor when you collect a profit no matter how small that profit may be, stop shipping packages without being upfront about what’s in them, and if something goes wrong, be more upfront and proactive about resolving it. I honestly would’ve been happy if you were giving regular updates but I had to hound you for information. That’s not right, that’s not how you help someone or do them a favor as you claim.

I don't think he's scamming anyone, at least I haven't seen any evidence of that but logically why are so many people worked up over this?  There's only one person in this thread that has any complaint and honestly, I've had Amazon make me wait for an investigation on a missing package before they sent a new one...so not much of a complaint, sometimes shit happens.

How am I at fault here when the courier company have 'lost' the parcel?

Any new orders I take are told the wait time is around 40 days, which is about how long some are taking... some quicker, some a little longer.

If I weren't doing this for the benefit of others I'd be charging a whole lot more money for this sh*t pal! My wife complains that I'm spending too much time "building batteries"! You think I don't want an easy life when it comes to my wife!? Grow up dude!

I told you what had happened. What did you want me to do, contact you every other day to say "still being investigated"... pretty sure you'd get sick of that after a week or two... I'm sure the parcel company are sick of me chasing them though!

Stop bitching like a whiny baby because I took longer than I anticipated to build your pack and the shipping company lost your package!

Yes. Kinda. Making money is work and in some way a business. Parents give allowance/toys to children for chores. It is a way to teach them how to earn money. You advertise on social media in order to attract customers so that you can do them a favor...at a cost.  So yes you are in business. 

When you decided to take on multiple orders for financial gain. You hobby/favor work became a actual business. Legally (at least in the US) in needs to be reported in you tax forms....no that anyone who make these small profits ever do. 

I recommend that you cease the arguement of the definition of what a vendors or business is. Concentrate on your defense that the internal shipping was the problem. Take your banter to DM. The more you vent here in public the worst your image becomes.

What exactly is the point if this thread? Has the original post already rectified the situation (to where it reasonably can be) and does any future comments serve an actual purpose in helping the OP? 

The package is lost, there is an investigation, this comment nor the next one or previous one is being rectified. Is the discussion something that should be here or on a whole other thread (or PM)?

Put your feet in the customers’ shoes. Would YOU pay for something and be fine with not getting anything? If goods were promised and unable to be delivered due to legal issues it’s your problem because of how you chose to send it. If it’s lost, refund customer and file the insurance claim and deal with your insurance refund on your end.

But no, let's keep talking about how much profit I'm making from building these packs for people that can't do it themselves....

Unless the buyer arranged and paid for the shipping separately through the courier company, then shipping the battery to him would be considered part of the service you are providing and he has paid for.

If the battery has gotten lost somewhere during the shipping process then that means you haven't been able to fulfill the service that he paid for and I expect that most people would agree it's on you to make things right, regardless of whether or not you're "in business".

Delays/issues can happen from time to time which is fine, but if he's been waiting 4 months when you've stated the turnaround is usually less than a month, I personally wouldn't consider you to be making things right or fulfilling the service he paid for, regardless of what the cause of the issue is.

I'd been in regular contact with him to explain delays. At any point before the package was shipped he could've cancelled his order and asked for his money back... but he didn't. He accepted the delays.

Maybe I missed it if it's been stated already but how long ago was the package actually shipped? 

If it was only shipped a week ago then I don't think it's unreasonable to ask him to wait a little longer for the outcome of the courier company investigation. 

If however, he's been waiting closer to a month or more with still no outcome then I'd probably be asking for a refund and expect you to recoup your costs via insurance etc once the investigation is eventually complete.
And as @Deckoz mentioned, if they eventually find the package, have it returned to sender.

1st April it was dropped at the courier office...

23rd April a claim was made as it went past it's stated delivery duration period...

It's been in investigation ever since and the parcel company have kept saying "we're still in communication with the courier who are still investigating".
I imagine there's some kind of cut off point where there'll go outside their SLA and have to confirm it's lost (if they don't find it). As stated previously. I'm not doing anything until they either say they've lost it or they find it....

I had to register on the forum to comments on this.

As it is right now Kevin, the whole fall has been taken by the customer of your services. 

You are arguing about "he's got himself a free battery at **my expense**" but have you even considered what the situation actually looks right now for him? 

You have got yourself money (sold your stock + work) at **his expense**. You sold your batteries, you sold your work (as in successfully traded your hours for money, which is not so easy nowadays for a lot of people), you got yourself all covered. While @Maxaweli got nothing. He just sent you his money and has received nothing for it.

The whole "delivery failed" stuff is not on him. It's 100% on you. Why is he the one taking the fall for it? As I have understood, you are the vendor here and you call him your customer. Customers never take fall for failed delivery.

Right now the courier company are at fault for losing the package.

I've done all I can my end to ensure the package gets to its intended recipient.

Right now, we're both in the hands of the parcel company to compete their investigation.

Like I've said, if they come back and they've lost it, it's on me, I'll refund him and take up any grievance I have with the parcel company... If they find it, he's got his battery he originally asked for. Done :+1:

If you were the one who organised the shipping then it's your responsibility to ensure that the battery gets sent to him in a timely manner. 

If he had no interaction with the courier company during the transaction process then he shouldn't have to wait months for the issue to be resolved, particularly when you chose to take the route of using a cheap, dodgy/illegal shipping method...

Something that I just want to add to this as @Maxaweli has failed to disclose it....

This guy has literally just only paid a deposit for his battery, it doesn't even cover the cost of the cells in the pack, let alone anything else... I've covered the shortfall out of my own money... In effect I've leant him the money, if you want to look at it like that...

Generally I take a deposit and trust that the recipient, upon receiving their battery pay me the remainder, and this is no exception.

It might actually be in my best interests to attempt to get the courier company to return to sender because as has been proven here, the recipient's integrity is in question, along with his intentions... I doubt, if this is found, I'd ever see the balance payment! :frowning:

The reason we don't allow these threads is because it normally always ends up in a back & forth argument that does NOT benefit the community in any way. In this case, it seems you are both in the wrong.

So here is some advice for both parties.

@darkkevind as a (potential) vendor you need to factor loss into your offer/business. For example, if every 11th battery you send gets lost in shipping & the battery cost is $100, it means you must add $10 to the cost base of every product you sell. If your gross profit margin is 50% it means you need to increase the retail price of your products by $20. This way you can take a loss on every 11th failed delivery. Your customers will love you and your reputation will help you sell more.

@Maxaweli if you chose to purchase a product primarily because it was the lowest possible price when compared to other vendors you need to ask yourself, what aren't i getting? As a buyer, you must also factor in the risk of loss. For example, you shouldn't pay using friends option in PayPal. You forfeit your buyer's insurance for the exchange of lowering cost. Everything has a cost, the lowest price often means you are getting less of something. Normally warranty or aftersales service is the first thing that gets removed when business is trying to save on cost.

i think darkkevind didnt do anything wrong and in my mind he shouldnt have to reimburse anything and they both should wait till the shipper deals with it.  hopefully it's insured.

a similar situation here with a very respected seller of batteries:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1rYgD8luGw

and here there are many many people in the lurch waiting

if Kevin did reimburse in the meantime while the shipper figured out what happened that would be going beyond what is expected, but then again I dont know what's typical and assume that is.

In order for this to be resolved, Kevin has to see the wrong in his actions but he refuses to acknowledge any wrongdoing.

That would be ideal, only he didnt properly declare what he was shipping, and therefore could not insure it for the proper amount. he told me he only insured it for 100 pounds, and I'm pretty sure it cost more than that, as my initial deposit was more than that.

Mike what the problem is here goes beyond this business to customer transaction, and goes to the business ethic of the vendor.

The vendor **denies** he is operating a business, even though by the definition in his own link he is, and that somehow that reduces his responsibility. His link was advising tax accountants they could not write off a failing business based on a few ebay expenses.
Further more he has admitted he has acted **fraudulently** in describing mail items, a act that is also **criminal**.

So in summary the vendor/business operator who has multiple transactions taking place at any one time who is operating a global business is in **denial** that he is acting **recklessly** or is being **irresponsible** and is in fact acting in a **criminal** manner.

This is not my opinion it is borne out of facts disclosed by the vendor in this topic.

This comment is 100% relevant to this topic and this community.

I don't disagree with anything you said, I think the 'tone' is misleading as the accepted definition of criminal requires thr occurance of a felony.  the content declaratiin would be at worst a misdemeanor and more likely a civil matter. 

My issue is that the vast majority of the comments in this thread are slinging mud with no it very little foundation. Your comment was in fact the only cogent argument I've read in this entire shit storm or a thread.

honestly guys this is not too uncommon with many of the sellers on the forum. A tiny buisness cannot easily recoup costs like this. And while the delays suck they happen a lot even for companies like enertion. As for lost products during shipping its kind of up to the seller. I mean he shipped the product and it got lost its not his fault because he did what he needed to do. Now yes he could refund the client but then he would be out a large sum of money that you dont make back quickly off of selling battery packs. At the same time I understand what you are saying @Maxaweli about having paid for a service and not getting it and I too would be pissed. But you are angry at the wrong man in a sense because the shipping company is the one who lost your package

So lets be proactive and look for a solution then. The issue at play here is that trust between @Maxaweli and @darkkevind have broken down. If someone trusted like @Michaelinvegas or you, whom both parties trust can keep the deposit in an escrow then when the investigation is over, and the package is indeed lost, the escrow holder will release the fund back to @Maxaweli. Obviously this investigation can't go on forever as it wouldn't be fair to Max. Give it a deadline, like 4 months from start of investigation.

To be clear, I am not angry. I've accepted at this point that I am more than likely not receiving anything. I am doing this warn others than may think about ordering a battery from him especially if they are not in the UK or Europe. I think after 4 months, I gave him enough time to make this right, up until today I had not told anyone except for a few who asked me about his services about this. and after a month of waiting for updates that I received few and far between i felt i had to say something. If you are a good person and do good work, then this should not affect you because you know the merit of your work and it speaks for itself. I dont plan on never ordering anything from anyone here because i know the majority of the builders here probably do great work. I love eskating more than anything @Kaly can attest to that :slight_smile: , I didnt like having to post this here, but i felt the need to.

1st I'm not willing to be the arbitrator for this. That needs to be a forum leader at least, but I doubt they want the responsibility either.

2nd, the length of the investigation is determined by the courier. There is nothing that either party can do to change that timeline. 

I applaud you for trying to find a solution though. 

The only practical solution I see is to wait for the investigation to be completed. If it's found the buyer gets his battery and then SHOULD  pay the remainder. If it's determines tinbemlostbghen the seller should return the deposit and pursue his claim against the courier.

@longhairedboy did me a favor and didn't charge me labor or any premiums because i've been his customer from the get go. I decided to pay him extra towards the end of the build cause I know he did me that favor and was losing out on labor fees, i'm not even sure if the shipping was covered. 

But the point I'm making is that every business has problems, and @darkkevind , whether or not its his fault, should at least has some kind of solution to @Maxaweli so that Max wouldn't be kept in the dark or not know whats going to happen. Claiming to wait for the investigation to end does not "solve" the issue at hand because if the investigation doesn't end, Max will be Sh*t out of luck for trusting in @darkkevind.

I'm not a prick, it is not lost on me that the courier lost the package and not Kevin, but he wasnt honest about what he shipped which may or may not be the cause of this package being lost or likely destroyed, or about his turnaround time, and was less than proactive about rectifying it. I did trust him which is why i put down a deposit and loaned him the cost of an R2, but he was not checking in, which is what lead to my trust in him deteriorating, which is how we ended up here today. At the very least, dont make people feel like they are hounding you for information you should readily have available, and then try to undermine their validity in being disappointed by saying you are doing them a favor while their money sits in your pocket.

If the investigation never ended then yes, but while they may take a ling time they always end. And then the decision is made.  Either the buyer got his product or the seller refunds. It's not far to expect the seller to refund before its defined that the package is lost as then the seller get the product and the refund.

In general they need to be transported as dangerous goods. This can be costly for small items as the paperwork and handling cost is high. It doesn't cost that much more to register a whole shipping container as "DG" as compared to a box. In some ways it is easier as the load for transport is then not mixed.

@Cobber ... there are multiple certifications to airfreight lithium batteries. UN38.3 is one of them. Cost to certify a battery for airfreight is around US$10,000 +. Change a single thing and you have to re-certify. Ground / sea freight is different. Not so far for the transport vehicle to fall. The big vendors do have their own channels. They may also limit the size to avoid regulations. In addition, they may use their own channels to move them around. Batteries would be the last thing I'd be selling and shipping ... Cheers.

Since the hoverboard fiasco, the US and other authorities around the world are all over it even more. There's a specific UL2272 for it ... but it appears to reach further than hoverboards and there are a range specific to lithium batteries. If you are making your own, good for you. Selling them is not a good idea IMHO ... I feel bad for the guy getting flogged on this thread ... but the solution is simple. Cheers

for whatever my 2 cents are worth. f the guy is in the US why didn't he tap up a battery maker there? Like longhaired boy ? If you had done your research on here you would of found multiple battery builders, also you must of known you would be taking a risk buying from abroad what with restrictions on batteries being shipped by airfreight. If I need a battery built where I am in France I wouldn't in a m million years get a battery builder on another continent to build me one. Just an opinion. As for Mr Dark, I've heard nothing but good things and have had very sound advice from him for my battery build. Hopefully this can be resolved amicably and at the end of the day we are all trying to help one another on here. Cheers 👍

As a customer of Kevin's, I'll add my two cents.

I was continually promised completion dates that were never met. Originally it was 30 days, then 'no more than more two weeks' and then another week. All of which led me to cancel my order because in all honesty, I felt like i was being taken for a ride. 


At no point did this feel like i was receiving favour and I was in genuine disbelief when i read above that the service should be considered 'a favour'. People do not profiteer from favours. I believed that i was paying for a service and in all honesty, i was.

I do believe this 'battery building favour service' did grow into something more than Kevin ever anticipated and I have no doubt that he could probably do without it. It is a victim of its own success. However, with its success you have to accept a responsibility to your customers - especially considering the amount of money some of them are parting with. 

Above all else, my single biggest peeve with this fiasco was communication and the resulting lies about my battery. Communication after the initial purchase became non-existent. I felt like i was having to nag for updates when the deadlines weren't met  - even then it felt like i was firing a few messages into a blackhole before i got a reply. To streamline things, Kevin should consider some sort of butcher shop ticket system. This way customers would know where they are inline and feel more content that progress is actually being made and that they aren't being sold fools gold.

Is this on topic?

4 Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. 5 It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. 6 Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. 7 It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.
