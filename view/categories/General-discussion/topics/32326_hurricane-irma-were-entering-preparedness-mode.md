This is a courtesy announcement to anyone with open orders or builds with LHB FES. 

HURRICANE IRMA is now a CAT 4 and less than a week away. Some places are saying it may reach category 5. To anyone who's been paying attention to hurricanes like i have for the last 35+ years, this is no surprise. We're not going to see a lot of cat 2s from now on. We done fucked up our climate too much. 

## We are going into hurricane preparedness mode. 

That means we're bagging and tagging and generally locking shit down, which also means any pending orders or builds will be delayed until this thing passes and we can unpack our shit again. As soon as the storm passes and everything is kosher and cleaned up we will unpack our stuff and resume operations. 

We're not interested in losing all our shit to water damage and having to file claims, so please forgive the delays. However, we are 131 feet above sea level and that should mitigate the flooding. It will not do anything about the potential for tree-in-house syndrome which may soon afflict us. However, this is certainly not my first rodeo so we got this. 

From Sunny Florida, we thank you for your patience. 

Time to fill to cooler boys. She's gonna be a doozy. More info here:

stay safe my dude! if FL can make it through 2005 (or was it 06?), itll be just fine for this one. Must admit though Im kinda worried that we've become quite immune to the threat since my hometown of Tampa always dodges the bullet. Hoping people there take any order to evacuate seriously

if it doesn't saw blade us on its way to Georgia then its going to head straight into the gulf, at which point it will gain a lot of strength and behave unpredictably. If you're in 'Bama, you might want to head to the grocery store too.

We're all pretty bone headed when it comes to hurricanes. Basically it boils down to "Fuck it, i know how to swim, kill food, and collect insurance so why bother leaving." I waas at ground zero during Katrina. I was basically right in the middle of the Giant Eraser track that wiped the entire Mississippi gulf coast clean of houses and trees. We stayed in my employers building, and watched as parts of houses floated down the street. Fun Stuff.

This is some scary shit. She's a Cat 5 now, and for the first time in my lifetime that i recall, all of the models are roughly agreeing on which way the storm is going to go. 

And all of them say we're fucked. lol

Best of luck to you and your family. Scary as hell. In some ways it's good that you can see these coming? I have Earthquakes here in SoCal, no warnings....quick death I guess.

Maybe when you open shop again, you should make a fully waterproof floater with these as wheels!

Rolled in to Gainesville from Boca yesterday. 5 Hr drive took 11 hrs. We are hunkered down here for the duration, moving hotel to hotel as we made reservations. I have a full tank of gas in my Prius after a 4am excursion last night, and I paid a small fortune for four new tires, but I am set. Looks like regardless of where it makes landfall it is going to roll over us. Hoping it will be a Cat3 or less when that happens. It should be interesting. I have rooms until Tues am, so we'll see how this goes.

We made it. We're safe, and the damage was minimal. No loss of property and no serious damage. 

Trees are fucking everywhere and it took us all day to clean up the yard. Power just came back yesterday monring and we still have no internet, so ops are still down. Can't do much without internet except clean up and get ready to get back to work, so that's what we're doing. 

Normal ops should resume by the middle of next week, so if you're waiting on something from us, please be patient. In the meantime we're taking the opportunity to get better organized, figure out where we are with everything,  and clean up this shit hole, which is all stuff we're normally too busy to do.

Good to hear everything is okay with you, I havnt had power since Sunday, if it weren't for the heat it wouldn't be so bad. The wind is gone and it's 80+ and humid at night. But other than that I wish I had a larger battery on my board. I've charged it with my car so far lol
