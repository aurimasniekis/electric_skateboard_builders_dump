Due to the rising cost of freebord bindings (my favourite) I am thinking maybe buying MBS bindings for my next board , never used them before , I am unlikely to want to add heel straps but want to know your opinion on which of the three I have put in the photo would you choose ? (For a kaly)![image|361x500](upload://xsIY0KeUVRyvM98turqhMefJtNY.png)

From what I have heard, they discontinued the F4 binding, F5 replaced all F4, if you check the US website, all F4 says sold out. 

Correct me if I am wrong...

Ahh yes it does say sold out of F4 (I didn’t think to check before asking this question lol) well that makes choosing easier then

The tragic thing is, those white F4s look fucking epic.

@MBS please make some white F5s!

I run the F5 MBS bindings and they are a notch above trampa bindings.  Well worth the money.  Shameless plug: https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/mbs-bindings-first-impression-for-those-who-really-want-to-be-one-with-their-board/71900

The binding holes are compatible.  You won't regret it!
