This is off-topic for this forum, but I thought y'all might be interested. For the last 6 months or so, [pacificmeister on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/user/pacificmeister) has been designing, 3D printing and building an electric hydrofoil. He discusses many of the topics that esk8 builders are familiar with from physically building the housing, modify boards, building the electronics, the powertrain, discussions about batteries, etc.

The entire series is totally addictive ... I've just spend the better part of the morning watching all his videos back-to-back when I should have been working! Here's a link to pacificmeister's videos: https://www.youtube.com/user/pacificmeister/videos

And, here's the very first in the series ... just to get you hooked!

Haha, too funny to see my project here. Thx @kane for mentioning it. I am glad people like it. All of you here were major contributors to this success. I spent hours on this forum reading and learning when I was building my e-skateboard earlier. On the foil I was expecting much higher amps so I didn't even consider the VESC. But turns out I only get to 40amps before lift-off. After lift-off I was too busy not hitting docks/boats and I could not look down on the display anymore, but certainly less once foiling. I want to try a VESC soon, love them in my skateboard. More to come. -msk8 aka pacificmeister

Ha! Great to see you here. I suspected that you were  a member of this forum after I watched your esk8 squad video ... but I couldn't find your user name. 

Kudo's to your skill and hard work. The whole video series is very impressive. When you're ready, I'd love to be able to purchase some parts from you so that I could follow in your footsteps. I've been dreaming about an e-foil for some time, but decided to start with an esk8 because I didn't have enough practical knowledge. I would still be a stretch for me, but I think I can now pull it off.

Jet ski electric surfboards sound so much manlier than hidrofoils :surfer: but are terribly inefficient :worried:***Hydrofoils let a boat go faster by getting the hull out of the water. When a normal boat moves forward, most of the energy expended goes into moving the water in front of the boat out of the way (by pushing the hull through it). Hydrofoils lift the hull out of the water so that you only have to overcome the drag on the foils instead of all of the drag on the hull.***

To each thier own. I want a short trick board. I'm more interested in explosive maneuverability in tight river spaces, we have a lot of that kind of stuff in Florida. Also flat bottomed craft are better in these kinds of environments due to the logs, alligators, turtles, manatees, ferile children, and face eating bath salt zombies. Not to mention plant life. Props are out, and anything dragging under the water is out in my opinion, even if its not for long. 

But i can totally see your interest in a lower friction device involving an underwater wing and i support your application.

I did some research into electric surfboards a while ago. The hobbyking jet may work, but it's a bit small for a surfboard and it's overly complex ... it has a directional jet which isn't needed for a surfboard. Thankfully, there's a growing e-surf community which has collide with the rc boating community.

@Msk8 Really really great project! I love the vlog and the iterative way you built your efoil.

We are interested in starting a project in Munich as well. 
Could you maybe provide **a part list of things so far** (epsecially which seal? etc.)? 
And are you planning on **sharing the CAD model**?

This would be awesome for us!!! Then we could start building from there, and iterate on it.
I am sure this will lead to a new community project, where many people share and give their experience back. 

Cheers from Munich

I'm not sure exactly where this is going, but for now I'm just using this thread as my online notes. Please let me know (either PM or on thread) if you think this is a problem. 

So, I've found one other DIY hydrofoil build but [Virus at youtube](https://www.youtube.com/user/vayrus7). It's quite a different take when everything is included in the housing including the batteries. His updates are much shorter than @Msk8's but very worthwhile watching to see the different materials and techniques. Here's the first in his series.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ku9bYjklwtc


It was inevitable the chinese manufactures would jump on the trend, and it's no surprise to see them [offering e-foils for sale](https://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/Gather-Sport-New-Designed-hydrofoil-electric_60671081903.html?spm=a2700.7743248.51.1.QZuLza). I personally think it would be this quick. Personally, I don't think this is a completed product. It looks like a mockup to test the market.

Finally, I found out today that some countries require a license to operate these types of watercraft. Here in Australia (specifically Queensland) you need a license to operate any watercraft that has more than 4.5kW power. Many jet surfboards have 2x or 3x the power, so I can build a jet surf but I can't ride it until I have a license. Looks like I'm going to boat-school!

Yes PacificMeister has done a great job and I am building something similar but with some modifications to improve battery life, and quick connects for my propulsion system and battery to my other boards so I can have my own [**DIY Electric Hydrofoil**](http://www.diy-electric-hydrofoil.com/), electric surfboard, and electric SUP. Super fun build but many more parts and things to figure out than PacificMeister lets on. It's a ton of parts and work.

Here is my first run at my setup parts, many things to change and add but I have hit the ground running.

Virus has an interesting design. It blows my mind that his tiny home made impeller of only 56mm can get him up and out of the water, mind you, its turning at 20,000 RPM which is insane... must be lots of cavitation but its got thrust...

Blow my mind the time and effort he has put in on the carbon fiber, they guy is a MASTER of carbon and a real inspiration to watch. 

That china company you linked to is no selling them yet, they said mid 2018... sure hope they put a housing around their big propeller blade... OUCH!

I had the prop made for me and have a couple others being made also (different sizes and prop pitches) as I want to test out different characteristics with various sizes, I have a 3:1 and 5:1 reduction drives, and ideally wanna go direct drive.

Yes, these work extremely well and are used for engines with lots of pressure behind them. You must be sure they fit tight and you pack around the shaft and in the seal with marine grease. This is as good as it gets.

You mentioned these seals are used for water pumps and want to know if it will be enough. 

Bottom line you/we are building a water pump... 
- a shaft with propeller pushing water
- All shaft seals will let in some water, these seals do the best job that I have found. Remember, all boats have a bilge pump because water is nearly impossible to keep out no matter the seal.

You could do a double seal, one on the inside, pack it with marine grease then put another seal on the outside, but that will increase the motor current as seals do have some friction.

I have had my electric hydrofoil under water all day and night last night, Ill be opening it up to see if my paper towels are still dry later today as I redesigned some 3D parts the other day.

hope this helps?

"Ducted Propellers I believe should be used for a couple of reasons. The main one to me is actually safety. I keep seeing people build and test boards with no protection from the propeller, and its just a matter of time before someone loses a lot of blood or worse…"

Yes because a duct is VERY likely to introduce a tremendous amount of drag, a properly designed duct could help you but it is so hard to get right that omitting a duct in the first tests will help you verify the motor / reduction / propeller first (which is challenging enough by itself ).

(battery voltag - motor kv and current - reduction - propeller pitch / surface area) really need to be matched, simply purchasing / printing a propeller wil result in burned motors, broken gearboxes and very limited propulsion power.

The duct you show in your pictures seem to have no (naca like) profile at all, is it simply rectangular when you look at its cross section? If so, this duct will add significant drag instead of efficiency.

I am unable to find the xjet followup video where he actually attempts to prove his theory, do you know where I can find that video? I think its highly unlikely a duct will improve efficiency. A duct might improve trust with the drawback that you have to put in way more power (thus lower efficiency). Just look at 95% of all marine propeller and surroundings, no ducts are used. If dutcs were to improve efficiency they would have been widely adopted already. 

The rake determines the angle of the board? I highly doubt that. The angle of the board is more likely to be a balance between total weight - foil design / profile - speed. 

Have you designed any propeller / foil in the past? On what information is you story based? 

What battery voltage / motor kv / gear box ratio and prop pitch did you chose?
```

If you read the articles I posted you will see the video and details. All this info is from reputable propeller websites, and educationals videos (video posted in article) 

As stated in the article Ducts are great for lower speeds and high thrust. You wont see them on speedboats, but you see them where the prop needs to be protected or when users need to be protected. Ducted props are everywhere. You simply do not understand the power of a foil wing which a ducted propeller has and this is explained in laymen terms in the video bottom of page [http://www.diy-electric-hydrofoil.com/ducted-propellers-used-diy-electric-hydrofoil/](http://www.diy-electric-hydrofoil.com/ducted-propellers-used-diy-electric-hydrofoil/)

High rake forces more of the waters force directly out the back of propeller, VS a low rake which forces much more of the energy out the sides of prop, reducing the amount of straight back thrust. Rake explained here: http://www.propellerworld.co.uk/Prop_Basics,_how_propellers_wor.html and also here: http://bblades.com/props-101/

Of course you need to match motor, KV/volts etc.. with prop, thats a given... Those who done, blow ESC's and motors are you know :slight_smile:

Good questions, thanks.

I know xjet, i have seen his video, he claims things with his limited understanding. He talks a lot, really a lot, he realises however almost nothing. I also couldn't find his video where he proves it. And with his example as well, if ducts were to introduce efficiency, why aren't they used with quad copters / dji phantoms? 

Like I said, the only useful feature of the duct is protection. Further the duct will likely introduce only drag. Please elaborate on everywhere, I cant seem to find examples of a widely adopted use of the duct.

The angle of attack, foil profile, weight it has to carry and speed determines the board angle. Rake will have very little / almost no influence.

Again, have you ever designed a prop? Have you ever designed a foiling object? All your explanation seem to be based on stuff you read on some website. Please be reserved / hold back a little with your claims and telling on how something works until you actually realised / tested the theory and have a thorough understanding of the complete system. 

What battery voltage / motor kv / gear box ratio and prop pitch did you chose?

The data is everywhere on the web talking about ducted propellers (kort nozzles) like here on wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ducted_propeller also the video I provided explains all this...

Go to virtually all propeller websites, or brand name sites like Mercury etc.. they all talk about higher rakes working better in aerated waters, helping keep bow lifted etc...

Of course I get my information from the web through lots of research.  

Ducts are used on some drones and helicopters but they those machines fly somewhat sideways to the prop/duct, it's not ideal for ducted propeller which makes logical sense if you think about it.

I think it's just best we agree to disagree, thanks for your feedback and hope you watch read about these things to learn more.

cheers!

For now I'm trying to figure out what size of jet drive I would need, what motor and barttery. E-foil looks super fun but i'm worried because of water plants in lake where I'll use the board. Long roadster ahead 😁
As for the sealings I was not able to find them localy but please take a look at those http://www.e-simmering.pl/pl/p/Uszczelniacz-8x22x77%2C5-CORTECO-12011511B/1366 .... and this https://m.banggood.com/8mmx10mm-Aluminum-Flexible-Spider-Shaft-Coupling-OD25mm-x-L30mm-CNC-Stepper-Motor-Coupler-Connector-p-995810.html?rmmds=detail-bottom-alsolike
I'm looking for some cheap parts as this whole thing is an experiment. I learn how to design jet propeller and I'll try to design jet drive for 3D print. I have a 3D printer so I'm able to test some different solutions 😉

Keep in mind, depending on what you consider cheap, this may not be a cheap experiment. You are technically designing and building a watertight remote control jet drive (motor assembly, propeller assembly, battery and ESC assembly, and need to create a waterproof remote control)

Just basic part cost not including couple dozen little things that add up really fast are:
Motor $150-$250
ESC $125-$225
Transmitter & receiver $35-$75
3D printer and or printer filament $99- $150 (Nylon is not cheap but can handle the heat and stress)
Reduction gear $124-$375
Water box for battery and esc $50
Batteries $200
(dont have a charger and leads? $150-$200)
Then, o-rings, seals, couplers, aluminum, wiring, connectors, SS bolts and nuts, conductive paste, propellers, shaft, etc..)
I ended up having to buying a bunch of tools to complete the build as well.

As you can see, buying just the basic parts alone will bring you $1000 in a blink of an eye. 

I have been working with manufacturers of the main parts I have used, and with a bulk order I can save 45%-85% on all the expensive parts, and have them arrive with all the custom connections ready to just bolt it together, plug the parts in, and start riding with the **[DIY Electric Hydrofoil setup I'm working on](http://www.diy-electric-hydrofoil.com/)** meaning at no extra cost to you for all the parts you could get the complete kit of all parts ready to be assembled. Just a thought as my goal is to make this simple for us all...

Side note, no matter what setup you use if there are a lot of weeds hitting your prop or getting sucked into your jet duct, it WILL be an issue

Oh yes I don't try to tell it's going to be cheap :) I'm just trying to keep cost low as possible. Looking at your part list I wonder do I need reduction? I think that jet drive needs much more rpm than efoil? Maybe you can advice in that regard.
What is a difference between rigid and elastic coupling?
As for 3D printer I have Zortrax so materials are limited. Recently they came out with PC-ABS. Its a mix of ABS with POLICARBONYTE so I think it will do the job for testing.

Those water plant are about 0,5m under water surface in areas where they are (not all lake) so that's why I think jet will be ok ;)
Thanks for the tips and ca't wait to see some videos of your work and maybe see some data regarding motor rpms (without reduction gears) amps and other stuff :D

@thetechtrader what gear reduction are you using?

@LukePL I've been trying to go without a reduction. Working on some props for higher RPM...

Nice looking setup!
Ya I have a 5:1, and 3:1, and a smaller prop setup for direct drive as well, as thats the most simple, compact, and cost efficient way to build it, just need the thrust, which is an issue with smaller prop, but I believe its doable...

Thank you @thetechtrader, What brand and model are the 5:1 and 3:1. Do they add a lot of length?

Sorry for the delay getting back to you, I have a no-name reduction gears for testing RPM's as the brand name units are $300 - $400 USD each, not cheap when you just wanna test as setup.

I just posted some info on another setup allowing the Efoil drive to quick connect onto any surfboard or SUP, and why I prefer under-mount VS jet impeller for an electric surfboard.

Check it out: **[DIY eSurfboard] (http://www.diy-electric-hydrofoil.com/diy-esurfboard-build-progress-benefits-mount-vs-jet-drive/)** - http://www.diy-electric-hydrofoil.com/diy-esurfboard-build-progress-benefits-mount-vs-jet-drive/

Also, Sunday I plan to post my first video of my build :)

That's so cool you are on this forum! I binge watched your series. I decided to sell a few of my land boards to make room for a foil before I leave Hawaii.

i watched the last video, part 13, and it looks awesome!
what is the total cost of just materials?

looks like someone made it for sale already and the price is $6000!  https://www.liftfoils.com/products/efoil

Yes, price is $12K, but there is new one being developed on Kickstarter that will bolt onto almost any hydrofoil using different mount types and its a video series starting up on how to build one as well. Kickstarter ends in about 24 hours. 

You can see it here: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/834430643/diy-electric-hydrofoil-and-surfboard-remote-propul

Dear electric foil builders,

The http://efoil.builders community just went live. We kept it very similar to this forum, built on the same technology. There is a fast growing interest in electric foiling with many special topics. We need more than a thread on a forum and this is why we started this. We expect a lot of collaboration and information exchange between the efoil and eskate communities. I also open sourced all my CAD designs.   

[<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/a/5/a51c5b42631ac6b580be70aa5ee3ce509ad74c57.PNG" width="690" height="397">](http://efoil.builders)

Please come join us for an in-depth discussion on electric hydrofoils. 

Aloha!

@Msk8 I don't know if you did it, or if it possible at all, but I would recommend to talk with esk8's moderators, I myself would find it great if all esk8 registrations would bi life on efoil too.

To be honest the 2 things are very similar, the same electric components, both are boards... Just a small difference, one has wheels the other propellers :slight_smile:

Would be great with all registrations be the same on the 2 sites. I can imagine, that they would collaborate better, if they would somehow be partner sites. Like ebay, doesn't mater where you register, you do it in all, and your search is worldwide :)   Something simlar here would be great.

Have a nice work on the new site :)

Very cool Tueboard! 
Love this idea, may take some time to get enough builders/project to fill it up, but love the visual aspect VS reading thousands of pages on a regular forum. 

My efoil is coming together and we are working on new **[waterproof surfboard remote control](http://www.diy-electric-hydrofoil.com/#!/remote)** that will go into production and available for the DIY community. It will work with eSkateboards, eSurfboard, eFoils, eSUP's...
