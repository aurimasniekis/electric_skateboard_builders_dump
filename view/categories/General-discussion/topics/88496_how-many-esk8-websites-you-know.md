Hi! Im asking this question since I know there are more than a couple sites around.. though, **who has really seen them all in one place?**

What I mean with this is.. that basically I know about:

Which seem to be a great site about many important esk8 related topics.

I also know about this site:

https://esk8builds.com

Which greatly hold this list of different esk8 part shops:

Though maybe some more should be added by now but still useful non the less.

Also worth mentioning is:

https://dosimplecarbon.com

![image|690x385](upload://3dmXDKIVsN92JR1dyGS90wimZu1.jpeg) 

Offers good tips on some hacks / remote improvement + other things

Maybe @danile himself can spread some more info what made him share his project and write other useful articles there ;)

So yes, if u **got more links to add, please share ;)**

I do know there are a few youtube esk8 channels.. though not entirely sure whenever they should be added / shared, but if u have a good one, share that one also ;)

I guess there are a few more which also focus on prebuilt/commercial boards .. but I guess in this case both of these work, just indicate, whenever it is for prebuilts or more diy esk8 related site.

Forgot about this site also:

https://www.ridefatdaddy.com/product-category/eskate/

Good selection of pre-made boards + lots of other useful info

Hah i guess im beating a dead horse here.. though hard to keep track of all the useful esk8 resources, especially when u need to share them to new builders, who are just starting out
