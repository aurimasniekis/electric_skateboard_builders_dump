Yes I saw your comment. As I said, the mount was only mounted on the truck for demonstration purposes because I'll get a new mount this monday. Still thanks for your comment!

The Hague is represented as well :sunglasses:! Getting all parts together for my first build this spring. Trying to make it as stealthy as possible though because of the high fines I've heard people getting.

Sorry for changing the subject slightly, but have any of you guys had any problems with the police? Will move to Utrecht in September and have read some horror stories about getting fined or have your board taken away (Not in that city explicitly, but the country in general).

Live at the edge of Utrecht for a year now. Since then encountered the police like 5 times on my board (as in drove by in plain sight). Never got stopped. Just behave normal, wear a helmet, don't go crazy with the speed in busy areas.

Nope not yet. I only ride around urban areas though. Correction, I have only ridden in urban areas and parks. Would not try to go into town with it. 

I have passed cops and cop cars but wasn’t stopped. When I passed I did slow down and also didn’t look if they were looking. 
I think riding on the hubmotors also causes less attention, which is also a reason why I chose the Meepo board. 

Just ride responsibly, stick to traffic rules, and wear a helmet.

I guess riding it to the university would be off the table then.
