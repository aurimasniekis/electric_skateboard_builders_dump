To evolves credit, they did invite diy boards to both of the last k1 speed races. In the last race, the standings where stooge boards, stooge boards, evolve, then me (on stooge trucks)... so not the image they want but they were still very respectful and happy to have us there. And that track is a few thousand per hour to rent...

I think direct drive is a smart move for them. But the question will be... can they make a decent direct drive motor?

There‚Äôs a lot of hate on direct drives and hub motors but that‚Äôs because most of them are garbage. You ride a few bad shitty cheap hubs and then you‚Äôll think it‚Äôs a hub motors that are the problem when it‚Äôs really just a cheap shitty motor and urathene problem... hummie hubs feel like your riding on clouds and you can feel the difference night and day.

Evolve have their fingers in bajaboard now.  Maybe some design share.  I don't actually have anything against evolve because if the boards work and thats a big if they ride very nicely and are a really good tuning platform.  Hopefully they don't just tart up the existing line up but have done a full re vamp.

Absolutely.  Full electronics overhaul is very necessary but I doubt that will happen.  Jeff would have looked at what evolve mods have been going on and acted accordingly the cheapest way possible.  New battery and bigger motors is my guess for an 800 buck increase.  Call it the GTO or some other such bullshit.  Hope I'm wrong and they put out a decent upgrade.

As for doomed no way They have a fiercely loyal customer base.

Yeah. I mean I‚Äôm a 21 year old know-nothing, but it seems other companies have the escooter game wrapped up. Boosted had a good thing with their skateboards because they were the first to do it and do it big, not because they are incredibly well engineered.

I‚Äôll eat my words if I‚Äôm wrong, but I think that scooter is gonna flop.

We adhere the cells to each P group, but this method can maintain flexibility per cell.
Manufacturing costs may also be reduced.  There is no need to solder the balance wire.

InBoard and Boosted are going after the scoot scoot market because it‚Äôs a different market. People generally would try a scooter before they would a skateboard because it handlebars and familiar turning. Their profit on electric skateboard is definitely what it used to be since social media is full of us pointing people the other brands and DIY.

The other reason, and it's great for Australians. They sell their boards (or used to) for the same price in USD as AUD. This makes them relatively cheap for Australians vs all other products which have a bad exchange rate. For example, Bamboo GTX street normal price on AU website is = 1779AUD (1246USD) ,  on US website = 1779USD.

I don't know of any other company that does this. For us, we normally pay the exchange rate + more.

I know if you simply color over it and export it you can certainly do some photo manipulation to reveal what's underneath because there's transparency in the color, but in this case I added a solid red rectangle over it then exported it. To my understanding there's no way to reveal what's underneath cause there's no longer anything underneath?

This board will likely sell for 2k US. For that I (and 200 other people, just off the top of my head) can build a board with more torque, way higher top speed, twice the range and look way cooler... Plus still have money for beer & burgers and gas money to @Sender's to see if he can shred it. 

Pffft

Evolve has a built in profit margin for decent boards, good on them, it's how business is done, but not here.  This is the place to build cool shit, epic shit, not expound on barely decent sit.

I'm calling that this board will have hubs like torque board hubs. This way they can use hub while being able to switch their off road wheels onto it. Not sure if this would work though... with the gearing and everything. But ive heard from an evolve employee himself that this board will be an off-road beast

Well theres alot of speculation on the performance when all we have is a bad picture. I expect the board to be better in many ways because Enertion has been dragging their feet with the Raptor 2 it gives evolve the perfect chance to swoop in and make something comparable but available and that alone would kill R2 sales.

Its like a voyeur obsession.  We would be having the same conversation if enertion announced a new board.  Look I'm all for a decent per-built because not everyone is as crazy as us lot.  Gets people on wheels then cool but really hope that price tag is worth it.  If it has a 30q or equivalent battery, some decent motors and a programmable esc then it will clean up.  They'd just have to limit the top speed though so the average joes don't wobble off into the trees.  Actually it would be good if they gave it a 70kmh top end just so we could watch the death of Jay Boston.  :crossed_fingers:

There is a big difference between hubs and axial or direct drive. Also, both not really made for pneumatics. As min the ones which are available now. In general i guess it‚Äôs hard to design one which would work well for one and the other. It will be always a lack of torque or speed in either pneumatics or urethane set up.

Brisbane council are currently negotiating with another scooter company.  Its obviously popular and trendy right now and making them a ton of money so I expect it to be brushed under the carpet and yes I agree, evolve are the only reason we are legally allowed to ride on the roads. 
While I don't necessarily have anything against a licensed scooter scheme, it will have a bearing on electric vehicles across the board.  (pun intended) good and bad.  

FYI   Guy had a heart attack because his body could not cope with the massive head trauma he suffered while wearing a lime helmet. Revision to the helmets I think.  He went down a flight of concrete stairs after braking too late.  So very sad for the family.

Guess Jeff gives free domestic shipping unlike the other Gold Coast based firm. I'm up the sunny coast and we are few and far between up here.

Once they figure out a way to tax us then everything will quiet down.  This is a big smokescreen to introduce some sort of license scheme.  Queensland loves a license.  One thing though and it is important is that some people do abuse the walkways.  Just watch that idiot Jay Boston and his little crew when they are riding around.  You've got to give people a wide berth or they will complain.

To be honest, it really sound like they took the time and listen to what people wanted. I hope there new product perform as well at it look. I have a bit of concern when they talk about a bluetooth remote, since it is one of the most unstable protocol out there, I just hope they use the bluetooth to describe a 2.4Ghz connection for uninitiate people. 

Even if they use the best cell out there at least they use 18650 and put them self a place holder if they need to change the type at one point.

I absolutely love the Carbon GT physical design, always had. Hate their remote. Battery is slightly improved, time will tell. At least they are pricing it at the same rip off price as the original...not really blaming them since profit needs to be made. Compare this with CarvOff and you will understand where I'm coming from. 

Non DIY people will buy this for sure. Who would want a Boosted over a slightly better Evolve?

35E can be a better cell than the 30q but only in a big battery like a 10s10p you would have the amps we we need for esk8 but more range than 30q.

It was approximately 32A discharge in GT mode in GT series.
This is a discharge at the time of full acceleration.
Once it reaches a certain speed, there is no need for a large discharge.
If the discharge is about 2-3A per cell, I think that 35E is not bad.
How about going uphill?

In turn you gain rolling resistance, wheel wobble (because on as smaller wheel the valve stem imbalance is more pronounced) and 25% faster surface wear. On paper it's a terrible idea but when you think what it means for a DD application, more torque with pneumatic goodness was worth the downsides.

It doesn't matter what cell you put in there. The battery won't magically push 15amps if the load doesn't ask for it. Soo, if the 35e is only rated to 8 or 9amps the 30q's will run very cool and provide way less sag than the 35e because the motor controller is already set to the maximums of the 35e.

30 miles is the official number. From my testing in SF it can do our entire group ride route then riding back to my place without charging and all in GTR mode maintaining full power riding briskly. It's about a 20 loop with huge hills and at the end you literally go up a mountain. I'd say the power system and battery is well done this time...

So it's a standard Evolve. Motors will die within the first 100 miles, spares will be pricey, customer service will be money orientated and markups will be abundant.

Case closed, let's all move on boys.

Well from what I'm seeing and from what they're telling me, they seem to have overbuilt most of the parts in this iteration. Let's not bash things before we know...

Basically every part is either redesigned or had their manufacturing process changed. Of course time will tell if it holds up...

I must say after watching this video, this is one of the best constructed battery i have ever seen in an eskate. I would be super interested to know the thickness of the PCB they have used and if its a specific composite to allow that much flex or just standard FR4. 

If they sold these 4p holders and custom nickel strips as a separate they could be awesome for diy boards . . . doubt this will ever happen tho.

IMO this battery design is a huge step forwards in eskate construction methods. If more boards used packs designed like this it would be great.

Ok we know some more information now.

Evolve employee has posted a video on our facebook group showing the board flat out no sag at 4% battery - Great! The kicker - its only 18MPH top speed.  So obviously there is some speed management to prevent sag going on.  What we need to know is what speeds does it restrict to at 75% battery, 50% and 25%.  If this board is low 20‚Äôs at 50% battery its going to be a problem.

No, it seems there isn't really.

10s @ 140kv @ 15:33 @ 97mm:

![image|690x74](upload://7QB1auIJ2MV0D335TGbswHvGcQx.png) 

18mph seems more or less in line considering at 7% if you're doing something that isn't going in an absolute straight line on flat ground at the fastest speed. In my testing there is still the same torque going up hills as there was at 100% so really that's all that matters I think.

It was hella difficult cus one of the replacement Focbox was missing the USB port. And I had to flash both of them new FW. I flipped my shit a few times thinking that I fked up and need to painfully solder on a new USB port. Got it figured out after a few hours, metr saved our asses.

Then there MUST be managment going on.  We all know lithium ion cells, if you had the same torque going up hills at the start and end of the battery life that means that its managed.  All li-ion batteries sag, so the evolve doesnt allow you to have everything when its fully charged to kewp it consistent through the battery.

Its the only explanation

Great review!
This is one of the best buys when buying Esk8 for the first time.
I was interested in 35E 4p, but I am glad to hear the details.
I think that 1cell 7amps is almost the maximum discharge in GTR.
I think the power is balanced at 97mm wheel.
I'm a little worried about Evolve being silent about the 107mm wheels.

Gotta stop somewhere is gorgious!

the reason is more that I won't do more than 45 km per session and during working days it should be 12-15 km one way with hybrid travel (subway or train), so to balance configuration, weight, ground clearance I think that 12s4 /12s5 (I do not have any stockoption registered with Samsung) are one of the most reasonable settings. perhaps a 10s5 or why not a 10s6 configuration should be an option to extend this short-list (better autonomy at the cost of lower high-speed or torque). 

my weight is 195-200 lbs

it is not a question driven by budget, as mine is quite open (< 2300 EUR excluding VAT and shipping).

it Doesn't require a cristal ball to post forecast like this, except NDC (NearDeath Company), recurrently vendors update their product catalog. so yes Evolve as others will produce more performant hardwares and also more expensive.
I hope they will take in consideration heaviest rider setting as 200-220 lbs are more and more common.
and even if they did some optimisation on power restitution using 35E rather than 30Q battery (many thanks @sofu for the review). 12S4 ou 12S5 are expected from us.   
Of course you won't increase speed or torque upgrading motors only w/o impact on autonomy if you don't upgrade also the batteries.

The only way to increase speed/torque of an engine w/o impact on ge batterie will be to increase motor efficiency, but electric motors nowadays are very efficient, and <5% points of efficiency are certainly possible at an expensive price that does not value the extra cost.
As my wife is telling it to me: Weigh Watcher Programs will do better job than motors upgrade w/o battery upgrade...

* A matrix of **12** serial cells each of them are a set of **4** elementary batteries in parallel,  **12S4** is for **12S4P** = 12 x 4 = 48 batteries.
* A matrix of **12** serial cells each of them are a set of **5** elementary batteries in parallel, **12S5** is for **12S5P** for purist and it is 12 x 5 = 60 batteries.
* A matrix of 10 serial cells each of them are a set of 5 elementary batteries in parallel, **10S5** is for **10S5P** for purist and it is 10 x 5 = 50 batteries
* A matrix of **10** serial cells each of them are a set of **6** elementary batteries in parallel, **10S6** is for **10S6P** for purist and it is 10 x 6 = 60 batteries

As a bunch of 60 batteries can be arrange into 2 configuration 12 X 5 or 10 x 6, this option is opened also.

A good amount of electronics we use are rated to 60V. 10s gives more head room for volatge spike, which result in a lower failure rate and less returns (in theory...) so good reason to don¬¥t go 12s on a production board.

But to me it looks like a strong cell at low voltage.

Perhaps we can focus our intention to Evolve rather than general engineering discussion. They are interesting and I will follow them with pleasure, but let go back to main subject. 3rd generation of Evolve.

I am pretty interested to read/analyse real condition hot run tests. 
Did someone with medium to heavy weight run some tests (uphill, stabilized speed run using a stadium ring, slowdown capability. 50m, 100m, 400m, 1km, 1mile run  with battery consuption and speed monitoring (for 80-110 kg riders)? 

I will try to do my best to put my name on a Evolve's demonstration tour in Switzerland or France, but to prepare test, some guideline will be perfect.

It kicks down into eco mode at 1%. The remote will vibrate to let you know starting at about 5~6% but remain into GTR until 1%. I don't think they're using voltage to determine when to kick down though... That's what the old ones did and that's why there were so many complaints

@sofu can we get some more info on this?

What are those brass inserts connected to? Are they only connected to the lid, or do they actually support the weight of the battery?

If the pack is hanging off of these then I'm very concerned. Those kinds of molded inserts are notorious for stripping out of plastic. There are MUCH better kinds for pullout resistance. You can already see that 2/3 of these have begun to pull out.

So there's a plastic cover that goes on top, that holds the inserts in. The silver screws (blue) screw into the plastic holes to hold the cover on, then the black screws (red) go through the cover into the brass inserts. The brass inserts are held in by the cover

If the inserts are moulded around during manufacture then they will be absolutely fine, don't worry. I agree that if they are push/press fitted, post injection moulding, then you have increased chance of failure. Given that they won't be selling 100,000s of GTRs it would be sensible for them to pre load the tooling with the inserts prior to injection. Sure it increases cycle time, but I think in the business of esk8 enclosure manufacture where numbers aren't huge it would pay off to do this way.

Lol my laptop disagrees. The majority of them have ripped out over the course of 2 years.



[These](https://www.ezlok.com/e-z-fin-inserts-for-plastic?_ga=2.263703823.2060057679.1557761809-1692018207.1557761809) have much better pullout resistance, and they are inserted post molding.

It's not exactly in their application description, but these can be inserted with heat post molding for a very strong bond.

Ones like [these](https://catalog.pemnet.com/viewitems/knurled-spacers-types-stka-stkb-stkc/d-in-threaded-inserts-thru-threaded-knurled-metric) are not very good.

yeah the second ones, the broach inserts, are what I was referring to. We used to push fit inserts here at my factory into PC mouldings but found them to damage the intergrity of the component as they were pushed in. It's been a while since I did insert moulding so maybe things have progressed since I last did it. (the first ones you linked) :-)

Thanks for the answer.
We DIYer know the remaining amount by voltage.  Ordinary users know the remaining amount by percentage.
Since Evolve is a board for general users, it may be necessary to express it as eco mode at 1%.
I am still interested in the conditions for transition to eco mode.

On this occasion I tried to do GTX battery mod.
However, in low-discharge and high-Ah cells, isn't old BMS and old ESC that become eco-mode at 35 V useless?
I think so.

Could someone who is knowledgeable with batteries (Moreso than the crappy explanation I am going to attempt below) explain to me what's going on with the sag?

The pack is, for the most part, designed to draw 32A, Given this, with AT Tires carrying the average man + gear up a hill (About 180lbs), how does this pack have "No sag". It would surely have to be drawing the "Burst" of 52A to maintain a reasonable speed & torque (Given i know speed is tied to voltage but you know what I mean I hope)? Especially given the low kv motors, which would help it get off the mark with a low battery but surely would not help on hills/grass keeping a good speed?

If this is the case, there is a HUGE problem. For optimal cell life, from my own research, you want to try to draw about 65-75% of a pack's potential discharge, thus keeping the cells at a minimal level of "stress" and minimising sag issues when the cell's voltage has dropped, allowing 30Q packs to go into the thousands of cycles if kept well in terms of charging from 20-80% capacity too. If evolve is withdrawing 170% of the cells recommended discharge regularly (13A / 8A), would this not absolutely destroy cell life? It would WORK for a while, but surely, after 2 months of riding, the pack would sag massively and cell degradation would set in very early? This may not be the case, I suppose we would need someone to use some kind of advanced BMS to actually genuinely record how many amps the ESC is trying to draw over an average ride with a normal weight male rider to see if this issue would happen?

The bigger issue is, reviewers won't know about this. I trust Sofu's review of the product, her board mustn't be sagging (Given she will be significantly lighter than the average male rider or a chonky boi like myself). But is there a catch in what i've explained above or should the product work fine?

All batteries sag, there is no going around that, the problem is how you deal with it, if you have a protection system that only takes voltage into account you will have problems, if you actually measure the energy of the pack and know how much there is remaining you can allow the voltage to go down and still keep pulling full current at low state of charge

Have you ever seen logs from a Tesla launching at full throttle? Around 50 V sag in a 400 Vish pack

About cell life, the problem is that there isn't a lot of data on pulsed application only continuous charge is discharge that hardly reflects how the cells are actually used

@sofu really good review, nice to see someone tearing this boards apart and showing the guts instead of taking it around the block and saying its good

Right, but the issue would mainly be drawing far OVER the recommended amps for a significant portion of the ride, (i.e needing the full 50A to get around on hills and stuff) would destroy the cell life, not necessarily pushing the cells even at low capacity.

its odd because at the 10A dischage thest it becomes only a 2.4Ah cell, while the 30Q was tested to 2.9Ah (dampfakkus.de). 

The IR is a lot higher (28 vs 18 mOhm) = more heat = more losses.... especially at pulsed high discharge situations

They have to be cheaper @ bulk like @taz suggested

97 mm wheel, 6 inch AT tire. It seems to be optimized in combination with these. GTR peak amplifier may be lower than older GT series.

I have been thinking about this a lot since my brief discussion with @sofu earlier on in this thread.

They chose the cells based on a wh verses power output basis.  They have looked at the power they generally need to run at and decided that constant current isn‚Äôt that much and the bursts are within the 35E specs.  Remember @Ackmaniac watt mode? I think they have their own version of that going on and are managing the power output in the same way. Those extra 2Ah from the 4P 35E pack over a 30Q pack are worth the drop in power output to Evolve.  I bet this is slower in GTR mode than the GT was/is

This might be me trying to cheat the system, but I might have found a potential loophole of sorts.

You can pick one up for $1999AUD ($1386.12USD) via the [Australian site](https://www.evolveskateboards.com.au/collections/gtr-carbon-series/products/gt_-carbon-all-terrain?variant=16296033058918)

You can also pick the up the same configuration on the [US site](https://evolveskateboardsusa.com/collections/carbon-gtr-series/products/carbon-gtr-all-terrain) for $1999

Rough maths say $1999 - $1386 = $600 in shipping!?!

Wouldn't you be best off to buy one on the Australian site, and ship direct to your house and wait the extra few days? Worst case you find a middleman or middlecompany to do the shipping for you and still end up saving a ton of money?

Do these wheels work with standard abec style pulleys? (Not press fit, the cheap kind with screws clamping down on the wheel) Just want to be sure I don't need a special evolve wheel pulley or anything before ordering.

They run different firmware an up the amps,  that 32 amps can be cranked to near 80  and use different motors. 160kv works well

If you want 6000W motors you should probably use a high voltage like 84v.
