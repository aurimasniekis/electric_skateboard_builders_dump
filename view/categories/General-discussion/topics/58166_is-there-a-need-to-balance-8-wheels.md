Hi guys,

I'm putting together an electronic mountain board for the first time so pretty new at this.

I mounted my MBS Rockstar II hubs along with 8" T3 tires, spun the wheel around by hand and got obvious wobbles even by at these low speeds.

I'm wondering if there is a need to balance these and if so how do I do it? I vaguely read about this somewhere in the forum but can't seem to find any information.

Let me know, thanks!
Erv.
