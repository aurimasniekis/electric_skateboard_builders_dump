So with the completion of my first electric board, I realize I am now without transportation on rainy days. I am looking to get a cheap cruiser board to use the old fashioned way. Any suggestions on what other people have and like? Looking for something small (<30") and cheap (<35ish). I'd be willing to swap bearings and wheels. Just include those in total cost. I found a cheap knockoff penny board for ~15 bucks. Not sure if that's wide enough. Just want it for transport around campus.

How much do you want to spend? Maybe just get a normal skateboard deck.

@lox897 less than 40 lol. I found a knockoff penny board for around 15, I could get a 22,24,27 inch variety. Figured I could put some nicer bearings on it. Just wasn't sure how wide that would be. Just seeing if anyone else had a small portable board they really like.

the beauty of the spud is, that you dont need wheel shields because the deck is covering the wheels completely! ;)

yea, aaand why would you need wheel shields over a fully wheel covering top mount deck? :thinking:

@lox897 hence the reason I want a second board that won't be electric. I don't trust my enclosure enough to sacrifice my esk8.

@whitepony for some reason I thought there was a shield for the bearing. Maybe I'm wrong...

EDIT: Those wheel shields do prevent water

yea, from splashing water up to the rider, they dont really save bearings from becoming wet ... and if at all then just a mild splash protection from just one side. ;)

You really should grease them bearings.

Don't waste your money on Wal-Mart boards. Try Craigslist? Customskateboards.com?
