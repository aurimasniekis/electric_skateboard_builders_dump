Thinking about building a new board, and wanted to make a sleeper evolve.  I was wondering if a torque board 12s4p battery and enclosure fit on a Evolve GTX deck?


Thinking about this setup:
TB 12s4p battery + enclosure 
TB 6380 x2 motors
Evolve GTX deck
Evolve trucks + 63xx mount plates
Stooge racing wheels
Enertion focbox x2
```

Yeah but it doesn’t flex like the deck does, the enclosure will probably splinter within a few weeks

Doesn’t the evolve GTX come with a long case too?

Torque board packs don’t flex at all, need a flex pack to work with the flex
