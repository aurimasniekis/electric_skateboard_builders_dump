Mini 2.4 don't pay more than $30 for it though. Its a great and reliable remote. Its just half the size of regular rc remotes and I wouldnt pay over that for sonething that small. You wouldn't be disappointed if you got one.

Which could be helpful for quad drive üòå

no you don¬¥t need.
you can also use CAN-BUS to connect all 4 esc.
I just don¬¥t like the idea to route a wire from one site of the deck to the other.
Plus with two remotes you have a back up if one site fails.
If can get disconnected during riding it¬¥s not good too.
so if you use CAN, than make sure you secure the wires good.
