For a couple of weeks website which I was using for calculations went down... Looks like server is down or etc but domain still present. If someone doesn't want to run it anymore and would like to share the source code I could put it up on github pages or etc so it would never die :)

P.S. I am talking about this: http://calc.esk8.today/advanced/

Sweet! I was just wondering, why are you cutting range in half when choosing a 2-WD motor setup? I think I was reading some time ago that having 2 motors instead of one doesn't really cut that much(twice as much) battery life/power as both motors become less loaded for same amount of work. Could you explain a little? Maybe here or in PM.

@Kug3lis This, your range figures are incorrect because you cut it in half on 2-WD when realistically the amount of power going out of battery is same in most cases.

I can´t speak about single to dual, but from dual to quad it´d definitly not the same. 

2x 12s5Ah lipos give me with dual 17-19km
2x 12s5Ah lipos give me with quad 13-15km

Yes, but my point was and still is: the decrease is not 50% as kug3lis calculator implies. You add 2 more motors to lose ~20% of range. On his calc adding a second motor cuts the range in half.

Its different with Lipos because you can actually output more power to motors with your huge C ratings. But In Li-Ion we are almost always limited by the battery even in some single motor 10s4p builds. Adding a second motor to these build will not really have a huge effect on range, maybe a 10% decrease.
