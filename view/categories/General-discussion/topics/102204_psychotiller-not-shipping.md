Hey guys, I bought an arc v2 enclosure from psychotiller 3 weeks ago...nothing, not even an update. I tried to contact him but no response. Is this normal? What should I do?

We should all accept the pay and wait business model. That makes tons of sense. I have no clue how defying that business model made Amazon so big

He's definitely been falling short on communication lately. 
I really like dave, and I know he'll get to things in due time.  But sometimes he is a bit slow.
Think he just over works himself. He probably needs to hire someone to deal with custom service.

Hopefully catching up real soon.

echo'ing what's been said here - I'm waiting on him to confirm when he'll be able to start shipping out new HeXL trucks, sometimes he takes a day or two, but after I follow up he usually gets back to me. 

Does seem super busy.

As a customer I can‚Äôt just wait a month without any sort of confirmation that Dave can even deliver...at any date. The order wasn‚Äôt cheap, and I‚Äôm desperately waiting on this part for my build. And yes I tried messaging him, that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm here. Nothing from instagram DM, forum message, emails, etc. feels like I got scammed. I kinda wish I bought from Big Ben, at least he responds. I think I‚Äôm gonna wait two more weeks for any sort of update, after that it‚Äôs gonna have to be credit card chargeback. I‚Äôm getting PTSD from enertion haha.

Ordered an enclosure on August 11th and it arrived this Monday the 23rd (31 work days - nobody works Saturday ;)
i think he was moving shop around the time i ordered so sure that didn't help

i would agree that Dave is a legit dude with good intentions. However, he definitely has overextended himself. I paid in full for a $2700 custom build and after six months of waiting and no ETA I had to pursue a chargeback. I eventually cancelled my order and asked him to refund my money but he went radio silent.

SIX MONTHS?! I don't care who you are or how busy you are, there is no excuse. If you don't even respond to messages, you deserve the chargeback fee because as far as I can see it's not any different from a real scam. Sorry that you had to go through that dude.

yeah, that's true, I'm all for forum members, but the waiting times have to be realistic with these guys. the "someone is very busy" moto doesn't work anymore if you are making profit.

Come place an order on my retail website, pay through a professional portal, pay a crazy amount of money! But don't expect to get what you pay for any time soon, cuz I'm busy. Don't try to contact me, cuz I'm very busy!

Have you seen other enclosures from other shops (not Ben), the ones I got were worth the wait.

I waited about 5 months for my battery.  Didn't think anything of it. 
He definitely went out of contact for a bit but took care of me and some. 
I'd definitely order again.  But I don't order much of anything excepting fast delivery. 
I do expect communication tho. 

On a full build.... I personally wouldn't expect a custom built to be done in less than a few months. 6 dosen't seem long.  But thats just me.

I'd expect great communication on a full custom build.

Please stop defending him. If you'd like to do business with him personally, that's fine, but he's represented as a forum vendor here despite the facts that he is never here, does not ship or even attempt to communicate, and yet I see his minions cover for him constantly so that he can sit on our money.

If I were in Psychotiller's shoes, I would be reinvesting this poor suckers $1600 over 6 months and be selling him a board that cost me nothing. Psycho seems to be doing pretty well for himself, made evident by the fact that he doesn't seem to think actually shipping things is necessary, so I'm keen on believing this is his racket. This isn't the kind of setup that I want to be involved in on the consumer side of things.

TL;DR, I'm not going to suck Psycho's dick just because he's got good enclosures, and you shouldn't either.

You could probably also ship a lot of Motors in 8 months that break in less than a hundred miles and keep replacing them for the same customer untill they finally buy maytech

Messaged Tiller on insta since that's what I've been told to contact him at a week or so ago about making an enclosure since I heard he got his vac table set up @ the new digs. No response.

A this point I'm just using tupperware because cheap and no wait time.

My friend was doing the same thing bro. He eventually did a chargeback and ordered from @Eboosted and it came in the expected 2-3 weeks :+1:. He also used Tupperware during the wait but it gets the job done :sweat_smile:.

Update: got a tracking number almost two weeks ago. I thought my wait was finally over... How naive of me. There is still no update on the tracking, USPS waiting on the item.
I'm on 7 weeks since initial order now. Still no response from Psychotiller no matter what avenue I use to try and get in touch.

if somebody brings up negatives, its only fair to bring up a defence. Or is the point of this thread to bash a supporter of forum because youre upset. Regardless of the circumstance, both sides must be voiced for anything resembling fair treatment to be had.

 Thats a threat more than anything and only hurts the community.
There is a string of evidence showing that the man eventually comes through. it just takes a lot of time. If that time is reasonable can be argued. You're within your right. I thought the same thing about my unity situation. But they eventually came through as well. Though I waited closer to 30 weeks.  With communication only after tons of badgering from me. In hindsight, I was just irate.

Oh I'm not threatening anyone, I'm doing what I need to do to get my money back. I want to remind you that the reason CC chargebacks go through is because the consumer waited an incredibly long period of time and did not receive their product, and the "seller" does not communicate in any way with the consumer. That, on paper, is what scam is. All this wait would be okay, on some level, if Psychotiller sent me a message about the order, or responded to my emails. That's his responsibility as an online merchant, it's not my job to give him the benefit of the doubt when I don't even know if this guy exists. As the guy who paid him I have a right to expect what I paid for, on time. It is NOT acceptable to have your own retail website selling all your stuff, not sending what you sell, just ghosting all your customers
 and having someone on a forum to defend your own reputation. Many people here bring up trust. That's not how trust works. A warning on the website about the wait time might have been useful. Would be useful to have the Contact Us button work too.

I have a lot of respect for Dave, he is a f**king legend, I have a set of sixshooters and they are bulletproof no pun intended. I would be happy to wait if just one email was sent or one reply. Going to grab a eboosted or maybe make my own out of fiberglass\CF.

I know a lot of people like Dave etc but if you don't have time to ship orders or make the stock, you should probably be looking at fixing the issues at hand rather than letting more orders be placed.
