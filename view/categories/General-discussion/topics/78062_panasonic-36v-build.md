![image|690x388](upload://4lgFvRUPSjb7GQ0LCK6flHVdpTo.jpeg) Hi Iâ€™m new to this so be kind lol 
Iâ€™ve built my first board itâ€™s very basic and to slow 
Iâ€™ve two 18v 5ah Panasonic lithium ion batteries I want to add to it am I right in thinking it will make it 36v 10ah then? Will this be enough power the motor is 36v .
Iâ€™m using the trigger as a foot button will this be ok with 36v ? ![image|690x388](upload://4lgFvRUPSjb7GQ0LCK6flHVdpTo.jpeg)

When connecting batteries in series you gain voltage. When connecting in parallel you gain amp hours.

For what you want you need to connect in series meaning you will get 36v 5ah. This should be enough depending how much current your batteries can supply.

Now another thing is to control the motor you need some sort of controller. People around here use brushless motors so that we can use a vesc or other type of esc. What sort of motor are you using? I am assuming a standard brushed one

Hi 
Yea itâ€™s a brushed motor I bought a few years back and sort of forgot I had I think itâ€™s an Eflow truck/mount ive connected it all up to a 14.4 v battery just to see if it works with the trigger off a Panasonic cordless jigsaw as a speed controller and itâ€™s fine now I want to go with the 36v I need Iâ€™m not looking for mega speed or mileage just a few miles at a decent speed like 15 mph 
Just wondering what others think ? ![image|281x500](upload://gz1GbzZZfK85lSb5Rcg5S8cb1ee.jpeg)

You could always give it a go and see what happens. Iâ€™m not sure if the trigger will be able to handle 36v though.

I think once you start having some fun, you will want to build an even better one ðŸ™‚

Yea love it ! 
I have a problem with connecting the batterys together ! There is another cable with a small 7 pin connector that goes to the trigger (my speed controller) from the battery without this the motor wonâ€™t spin ???
