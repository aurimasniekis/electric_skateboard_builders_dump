Right now we have belts and hubs both with their pros and cons and I'm not gonna argue about which one is superior all I want is choice.

I've been obsessed with the idea of using gears instead of belts ever since I saw someone using them here on this forum. I think if done right a gear drive could be easier to maintain in the long run even if it means higher costs upfront. 

I've searched around about the matter but most avaible gear drive systems are for mtb but I really want something for street boards and there isn't a lot of interest in them in general. The main cons with gears is alignement and noise which I think can be ironed out with R&D

I know that the small size of street wheels makes it challenging but I really hope that someone comes up with a user friendly design. I really want to contribute to R&D but I don't know anything about gearing but I wouldn't mind if someone enlighten me about the subject.

My dream is having a sort of sealed gearbox that also serves as a motor mount which can be made in different ratio that uses commonly avaible parts for simplicity.

Again I'm not trying to reinvent the wheel or anything i just want to see another viable option on the market

You should check out @kug3lis gear drives. I just ordered the Fatboy mini 3:1 gear drive for TB218 lol. He makes high quality stuff and you can check out @mmaner and @deckoz builds with these drives both using big wheel hubs and urethane gear drives respectively.

Although there aren't any ways to change ratios on the fly as that would mean gaps within the gear box I don't think theres a dire need to have it changeable. Currently only @kug3lis provides gear drives that use standard RKP trucks while others like @nowind or @kaly produce gear drives for mtb style decks. You can always go with Trampa gummies if you want that street performance. 

It is also difficult to machine these gears and have to align them just right if you want a variable gear ratio. You're right on the noise but if Helicals make enough market sense and can reliably be produced then you can make it much more silent though I've asked @kug3lis about it and it just doesnt make much sense for the added complexity of Helical gears as these are not as easy to produce hence they allow for lubricants to get that silent operation which i think is nice cause you can get one thats more audible(when running dry) or silent when lubricated. 

Just my 2 cents but been reading and researching about it as well until I finally made my choice and purchased my drives earlier. Hope this helps! :smile:

Edit:
@kug3lis is also in the process of releasing his urethane gear drives that work with 107mm though I would expect them to work with @torqueboards soon to be released 110mm urethane wheels

Edit2:
Disclaimer i don't work for or with @kug3lis :laughing: but I think I can give credit where its due as He's done well with providing these to the market.

I've checked their stores actually! But I kinda want more a bit modularity. Gear drive is still niche in the esk8 community so more vendors jumping onboard is welcome 

Also what I meant by variable gear isn't actual gearbox in itself but swapping the whole mount for a different one (yes that'll be expensive hence my desire to find avaible parts)

You can try hitting up @uigiroux as I've had some discussions with him about his gear drive that He's working on that allows easily swappable urethane or pneumatics. You could always purchase the mounts and swap the entire mount and gears though I don't know if its as simple as that to get the modularity you're looking for.

Though that is something i would like to have, I do expect to stay on pneumatics as roads here are bad so the less problems to worry about when going for a ride is something I'd take.

Awesome! All the best with the development! Would be curious to know the reasons as to why the decision to go with 3 gears over 2? I do recall @uigiroux stating that would get better clearance of the ground but are there any other reasons like say, in terms of performance and torque delivery?

## \#7 Posted by: moon Posted at: 2018-08-06T12:52:53.585Z Reads: 265

There are several reasons, most of them can be explained by @uigiroux since I am just the guy designing, he has just thought out gear ratios and all the good stuff.

One reason is because it allows us to use a smaller wheel gear, which means we have more clearance.

Understood. I haven't spoken to @uigiroux since then but I do kinda get the idea of it. I went with the Fatboy drives as these were already out in development and I didn't want to take too long sitting on parts and all as this will be my first build. 

I'm definitely interested to see the development of the drives as these would certainly be the first around with 3 gears that I've seen on the forum. All the best to you guys! :smile:

Yup 3 gears is mostly for clearance with big 6374 motors with urethane wheels that's the main challenge with gears they're inflexible with size adjustments and the main reason why they're mostly avaible for mtb only.

I've seen @moon's design with the 3 gears and I really like it. If we manage to use commonly available parts instead of miling them from scratch that'll reduce the costs by a fair bit but that's not easy I guess. If someone want a different gear ratio we can make it so that they could change the whole box because making interchangeable gears within the same box would be too complicated I'd rather have multiple gearboxes with different ratios instead

Well they are module 2 gears but they are modified to have bearings inside, and they are 15mm wide.

Sure I could design something that could use stock gears, it would cost next to nothing to buy. But it wouldnt be very reliable

Right now there's only 1 commercially available for street wheels, I'm waiting on Fatboys for Dual Rear Drive since the only one available street wise are only 1,000 for two. They're efficient and very well may be the next dominate drive train. They should be popular street wise anyway.

Definitely have to say @moon is the real genius behind the design we've been working on, I don't know how to use the software, so he's done the majority of the work.  The main idea behind using 3 gears is two fold.  First, it gives you enough clearance from the hanger and base plate of the trucks so that any motor size can be used (63mm, and if the hanger is long enough, up to 84mm, but for most that would mean 6374.). Secondly, it makes the ground clearance from the wheels side of the gear drive much greater.  I'm not sure what we currently have for clearance as the ratios have changed a few times, but we had up to 24mm clearance at one point (figuring with a 107mm wheel, the case was 59mm in diameter at the wheel).  Anyway, we're just trying to get some finances sorted to proceed, but that's the basic idea behind it.  Originally I was thinking just about using a 2 gear drive and making the hanger longer so the clearance from the motor to the hanger wouldn't really be addressed directly, but decided against that as it would make the hanger very wide and effect turning radius, etc.  So we haven't been able to make a prototype yet and see how realistic this concept is, but I think it's definitely looking like a good idea, and @moon has been fantastic at solving many design challenges we've come across :slight_smile:

I'd love to see how it looks and how well it performs! I'm sure it's possible to retrofit the system on current belt based motor mounts such as @marcmt88's brilliant mounts.

I was thinking of 3D printed prototypes with no load just to see the behaviour and then move to actual metal parts for the final product

Another advantage of 3d printing the gears when prototyping is being able to try with existing stock using their 3d models

it depends on whether the idler is used in the calculation of the gear ratio. if not, the idler is just there to transmit the "drive" and also to extend the total gear center distance.

i may be wrong, but that's what i see/think it does.

Right right. Isnt computing torque via gears also dependent on the distance between the pulley and the motor? Iâ€™m taking this from a topic Iâ€™ve discussed with a friend so I may be completely wrong lol

Yes that's wrong, lol.  Distance has nothing to do with ratio.  It's just the difference between the motor gear and the wheel gear.  The idler gear doesn't even affect it overall.

Edit:  Just saw you were talking about torque, not specifically ratio, so I can't actually say that for sure.  I just know about calculating the ratio.  I know with belts there is many different things such as the width it the belt, but for gears, I'm not sure if that matters as much.  I know they transfer torque much better than belts, but I couldn't get into specifics just yet :smile:

Oh sorry didnâ€™t mean to misinform so just disregard what I said haha. So its simply for allowing a smaller gear on the wheel which increases the clearances to what you stated earlier? So no actual or significant impact to the torque delivery/output?

The ground clearance and the motor from hanger clearance are the main reasons for the design.  It'll probably take a bit of testing prototypes to determine just how the smaller gears transfer torque.

I can't say just yet since we haven't made it yet, but in terms of calculations, the idler gear actually doesn't affect the ratio from the first and last gear I found out.  What's yet to be determined is if it'll be better to have an idler gear that's exactly in between the sizes of the other two gears to keep equal torque applied to both sides, or if it'll be better to just have two of the gears be the same size.  All will revealed after testing :slight_smile:

I'd also like to point out that @idea has some very awesome looking gear drives that's he's made and been testing for awhile now.  I've messaged him a few times trying to get him to sell me a set, as his do work with PU wheels and so far as I'm aware they don't have clearance issues, but I can't say one way or the other as he doesn't want to make claims without the testing to back it.  These look very nice though!

I've personally heard inrunners in rc planes and they're very high pitched so I don't know how it translate to esk8 in terms of noise

In terms of gear drive I donâ€™t  think the type of motor affects the sound much if at all as it still engages with the gears the same way which imo will be significantly more audible than the motor regardless if inrunner or outrunner

Edit:
Even with the top notch Helicals that @nowind produces I still think that sound does come from the gears albeit way way less audible.

Here's a couple of facts for you guys wanting gear drives that I've learned from the mechanical engineers I work with

1.  They are all gonna be loud unless you seal the drive train and use lubricants.
2.  Helical is quieter than spur, but not by much.  It's also much weaker as the stress is localized to individual portions of the tooth whereas spur gears spread the stress across the entire tooth.
3.  A case is almost irrelevant unless its sealed and you are using lubricants.  It increases the cost a ton and only protects the gears from debris and intrusions.  In my experience you are no more likely to have a hard stop from debris than you are with a belt drive system.
4.  Gears will produce more torque using less power, than the corresponding belt drive system.
5.  When using an idler gear make sure there is plenty of mass to dissipate heat as the idler gear will produce twice as much heat as a wheel or motor gear.  If you let it get too hot, your bearing lubricants will burn up and eat the bearings.  If you can avoid using an idler gear, do that.
```

Thanks for the great insight! I didn't know the idlers would generate that much more heat.
Also on your 3rd point, when you mention that you're no more likely to have a hard stop from debris with gears than on a belt drive is assuming there is no case? otherwise gear drives don't have to worry about debris in that sense?

I recently placed my order for @kug3lis fatboy mini and I hope to get a similar experience to your build too! 

I also thought that helicals did not suffer any differences of stress on the tooth as compared to spur but that means I still have to read up alot more.

Wow, thanks I never even thought about the heat issue on the idler gear...  We'll have to come up with some good ideas on how to deal with that...

We plan on making a fully sealed case with lubrication, but why is that 'a ton more'? I understand the extra cost of machining the parts, but I don't see how that'll be a significant amount more than just a sealed case as opposed to a fully sealed case filled with lubricants?

We've always used helical gears. They're tricky to get right and you do have the issue of axial thrust which you don't get with a spur gear or herringbone. We've done a lot of work on noise reduction and the boards are near silent below 20km/hr now.

Yes, that is assuming no case, just a regular motor mount with spur gears instead of pulleys and belts.

Honestly, I did too.  It made sense to me that helical gears, being more complicated to manufacture would have some benefit to offset the cost.  I assumed that benefit would be strength.  Turns out the benefit is the turn is more precise and that is pretty much it.  It is a little quieter, but I think only by 10-15% in our application.

That is a guess, just want to be clear about that.  I've only done limited testing as the production cost is way to high for the benefit, just my opinion.

There's a lot of math behind helical gears and they have several advantages over spur gears in all our testing. Wear is something we've not had any issues with, but our gears are made from hardened carbon steel. We had issues with spur gears shredding a lot when we tested them.

I never even thought about the heat issue on the idler gearâ€¦ Weâ€™ll have to come up with some good ideas on how to deal with that

Thermal mass being the idlers mount and really good lubricants are the only options I know of.

[quote="uigiroux, post:55, topic:64023"]
We plan on making a fully sealed case with lubrication, but why is that â€˜a ton moreâ€™? I understand the extra cost of machining the parts, but I donâ€™t see how thatâ€™ll be a significant amount more than just a sealed case as opposed to a fully sealed case filled with lubricants?
[/quote]

That's the magic...  I am proposing that you don't need a case at all and the benefit of a case only exists if its sealed and uses lubricants.  I'm trying to say, apparently not very well, that you can treat gear drives as belt drive replacements simply by swapping the motor and wheel pulleys for gears, assuming the existing motor mount will adjust to the correct distance for optimal gear contact.

Carbon/Hardened steel is a different ball game than ABS, POM Aluminum, etc. which is most people around here are using.  Im not saying helical gears are bad, I'm just saying the benefits don't justify the increased cost of manufacturing when speaking of limited runs of 100 pieces or less.  

I can't even guess what the cost of helical 12t & 36t spur gears would cost in carbon steel :).

Just so Im understanding clearly...are you saying you had issue with hardened/carbon steel spur gears shredding?

One difference though between a hard stop from a belt drive compared to a gear drive with no case that I think is how vastly different they each would respond to something getting caught in the belt compared to a gear.  With the belt, since it's got some flexibility and can stretch some, it's not like a 100% certainty that say a pebble getting caught in the belt would cause a hard stop, but maybe just a jolt or something like that, or of course it could be a hard stop.

With gears though, I think it's almost a 100% certainty that if anything gets caught in there, they are completely fixed in place and don't allow for any play, so they pretty much for sure will have a hard stop from pretty much anything getting caught up in there.

Wow okay not sure what the fatboy mini drive spur gears are composed of but my guess is aluminum. The price does already burn a sizeable hole in my wallet :'( but I just tell myself its gonna be worth it in the long run. I guess with carbon steel the teeth would likely be fine subjected to the stress?

would probably be a PITA to replace should anything damage the gears for whatever reason. Also a pain in the wallet lol

Respectfully, I disagree and my testing bears it out.

1.  Timing belts don't stretch, they cant, they will tear before they stretch.
2.  Debris when it intrudes into the belts path or the gears path moves sideways so quick it cant get caught.  The behavior is literally identical.  

I don't run belt covers for the reason that debris gets trapped and is reintroduced to the belt path over and over until its finally ejected.

I spun up an ABS wheel gear and Aluminum motor gear, with no case, using a 10s4p pack and 190kv 6374 motor and started dropping crap in to see what would happen.  I used staples, nails, screws, aquarium gravel, limestone chert, river gravel, copper rivets, pennys, everything I could get my hands on.  Not a single time did anything embed in the path of the gears.

Well I'll certainly take your word on that as I've never had that happen to me.  That would freaking suck though!

Do you think making the idler gear larger and maybe out of a better material that dissapates heat more efficiently would be the best thing to do.  Obviously, do all the things mentioned, but I imagine that would do the most in addressing that issue.

For a sealed gear drive with a lubricant, I imagine there is a specific type of lubricant that is used for high heat dissipation...

@mmaner thank you for bringing these issues to our attention, highly appreciated :slight_smile:

We've tested a bunch of different materials, including hybrid material gears made with steel cores and POM teeth. In everything we did we were able to shred the gears at a much faster rate than with helical. Granted they're more complex to make and lots of finishing processes required to dial in the tolerances, but the benefits are definitely worth it.

I would guess there are kunticanta that have the benefit if heat disapation but I don't know what they are. 

My best guess on a properly built idler gear would be to use a hardened steel gear with the mounting poiint being at least 7mm of aluminum or more of steel. 

If the case is sealed I think any decent lubricant would cool the bearing in the idler gear with a substantial amount if heat dispating mass behind it.

I'd be interested in discussing the benefits if hekical gears. Like I said, I don't really see much benefit. I've totally destroyed oom and and motor pulleys, but steel seems to hold up forever. 

I'm using a dyno tester as the surface, conrete blocks as weights and straps to hold everything in place. I'm then alternating the weight of the blocks with a piece of rebar as as a pivot handle. 

I'm essentially running 200lbs on a deck with a single motor, alternating the weight placement and trying the break the gears.

Another diference you have between spur and helical is impact, with the later having none if designed and assembled correct

This may seem little, but surface fatigue on gears is a big problem, and helical solves that almost completely

With spur, each tooth engement is a impact, thatâ€™s where the sound come from, but with helical you have a smooth engagement. If you could plot the surface pressure of both, the helical would be a smooth curve, spur would be steps

Is the surface fatigue you're referring to the same as what @mmaner mentioned earlier about stress points along the gear tooth? I do see that it would play a bigger role on gears made out of other materials besides metal but seeing as metal on metal gears look to perform well and are quite robust so far maybe its negligible in those cases?

Not exactly,

First for the spur, the ideal contact point would be a line, but since nothing is perfectly rigid itâ€™s a rectangle. When two teeth make contact, this contact happens at once at all points of this rectangle of pressure, and it happens almost at once, from no surface pressure to full surface pressure. You can lower this by making more teeth being in contact at the same time, but to do so you need to decrease the pitch of the gears or increase their size, both have downsides 

For the helical gear the ideal contact would be a point, in reality a circle. When designing a helical pair you should make it in a way that when a tooth is engaging, the previous one still engages, this way you can make the surface pressure smoothly go up and down at each loading cycle

![image|261x261](upload://mNeRRIl8FYXeJiIdiys15pm7qFU.jpeg)

Since we are discussing gears, what id like to see is someone actually designing them, from what I know nobody did that yet. By that I mean really doing the math and properly material and geometry selection, I think we can arrive at a way more compact arrangement and that most setups we see are way oversized

If I manage to have the funds to make one one day I plan do that, I already have most things implemented in a spreadsheet from other projects

Yeah, this is more like general use, not esk8 specific, as I said, I believe most if not all designs are oversized, we probably wonâ€™t see any of that unless we reduce things and start running at the materials limit

Also this apply for steel/steel gears, most here are steel/pom or steel/nylon, unfortunately I couldnâ€™t find a lot of references for non metallic gears, since plastics behave completely different at material level, most guidelines and formulations you find in a machine design would be useless since most of it derives from experiments

Ah I see, So I shouldn't take it too seriously into consideration about wear and tear on the spurs then. That's good because I don't have the budget to replace or fix these anytime soon should that kind of tooth damage occur lol.

though the drive train that I purchased is steel/steel but they're well made so I'm hoping that the contact point will be as close to a line as possible but like you said that may not always be the case. 

I don't think I can run the drives that hard to cause that kind of damage unless I'm always doing really hard braking or something which realistically would probably send me flying without bindings :sweat_smile:

What do you think about POM/Steel as it looks to be what @kaly is using on his spur gear drives. Motor gear being steel in that case

Edit: 
sorry I re-read your last statement about POM/Steel. I suppose real world use is the quickest way to know how well these types stand up to our application.

POM behaved better than all other polymers even with no lubricants just thin air. 

Just note that POM starts to melt at 150C, but a gear drive should not exceed this temperature, we would not know that though until we test these drives, but if so, heatsinks may be needed

Yes, there is no gear movement inside the tooths, also contact is made by sliding gear in not slamming against surface so sound and stress is greatly reduced, also I have never had gears heating up to even feel difference, most of the time heat is from motor conducting heat through baseplates to gears and etc (Gear drives absorbs motor heat so it can run cooler in summers) 

Our gears are made from POM and Aluminum, I can tell that even after 3k miles POM gear has like minimum wear, and aluminum just lost it's anodization on gear tooth.

dang if there's hardly any wear safe for some cosmetic effect over 3k miles then these would have handled abuse very well assuming proper uses on the right terrain. I couldn't tell it was made from POM as well to be honest as they both looked like they were machined from Aluminum. 

So by sliding gear that actually shares the same characteristic of Helical by having better tooth engagement while dissipating the force across the tooth evenly. I may just stick to 190kv to stay on the cooler side. Interesting to know that the gears themselves help take take off the heat from the motors so should expect better performance over longer rides especially going up longer hills.

Edit:
Might make it more attractive if you put that onto the product description on the site :grin:

Still there is the two thrust forces neutralizing each other creating excess friction, creating heat and wasting power and without lubrication  X 10.   To top it if your out of alignment .005" it's complete junk. Helicals are a mistake. They take power, create heat, cause thrust, expensive to machine and a pain in the ass to setup. Helicals are great for reducing noise and should only be used in a fixed gear alignment situation, proper lube, debri free environment with proper Torrington or thrust bearings. A terrible idea for user friendly and cost effect.  A well machined set of square cut are quiet enough without lube, steel on steel.  A precision cut set setup properly in lube are nearly silent.  Heat, strength, durability, availability, variety, and efficiency are all non issues with square cut gears. I've put 100's of miles through open non lubed mod.8 (32p) at 5200w available per pinion over 50mph multiple times on dirt and miles uphill @ 40mph.  The worst possible torture and conditions for any drive system out there available with Zero failures. With no lube the mod.8 9t pinion needs replaced around 60miles, spurs still show no signs of wear.

i would use a gear drive over belts provided i could replace the wheel or motor gears and adjust the teeth mesh afterwards by sliding or repositioning the motor in some way. 

Once size does not fit all, which is the only reason i'm still on belts. I need to tune my ratios the way i want them. Some people need more power, some need more top end and most need something not quite in the middle. 

Gear drives can solve the ratio problem while also eliminating the belt problems, but it can have problems of its own. Belts are forgiving of tiny rocks. Gears .. not so much. Gears can be sealed a little easier than belts because you don't need to change out anything and there's plenty of semi-permanent lube out there to make them even lower maintenance, so that can solve that issue. 

There's a lot of work to be done in this area.

That's almost all reasons why we are not going to make helical gears, as some friends from sport car transmission industry mentioned, helical gears are for city cars to sound less noisy and etc, but they have so many bad features that you will never see anywhere near performance related stuff, just straight cut spur gears in all performance related parts.

Also most important thing why we do not want to use helical, is that even small mis alignment will shred all the gear tooths even from steel gears... Thinking about DIY community you want something stable and working for everybody no matter skill levels. :blush:

Nice, did you manage to keep sliding to a minimum with this profile?

About the heat, I donâ€™t think we will have that problem. Heat in a gearbox comes from friction, and what really heat things up is the continuous power output, and that is relatively low, for me is arround 300W, for MTB could be a lot more, but even them, if the system is 95% efficient it would be only 75W spread against both gear box, thatâ€™s nothing considering you have the trucks and mounts as heat sinking surfaces

Keep in mind that 95% for a spur gear is in the low end of efficiency, if your drive train is less efficient than that thereâ€™s something wrong

While I'm not an expert on this but I don't think silent gears are even needed because noise dB is not the issue, it's more about the pitch and we just need to avoid producing noise in the 2-4KHz region (human hearing peak sensitivity). I'm pretty sure that we can tweak the noise output by altering gear characteristics to make it more bearable to the ears. Some industries do exactly that already and I'm actually surprised that nobody digged into this here

The pitch changes drastically based on RPM. The material choices are limited. Not sure any of that can be compensated with the exception of using specific gear profiles as has already been explored, but I fear that a decrease in noise just equals reduced contact area/gears that wear down quicker.

Pitch and noise levels increase with rpm and it's usually the higher end that gets annoying but you'd surprised by how much tiny changes can affect perception. 

I've worked with a lot of performance computer fans where silence (or the perception of it) is really important and I've seen very similar fans having drastically different perceived noise at the same dB. Tiny changes in blade design can yield drastically different sound signature but I don't know if that's entirely true with gears but I'm confident that some of it is true

Haha, but lower pitch travels allot further. I honestly find my low RPM noises allot more distracting and I know others notice me much sooner when I go slower. Changing pitch just makes it annoying on a different level. You'd have to do allot of weird tweaking to get past the hearing threshold.

Fans are made quiet due to adjusting how it chops air mostly. Same is true for millitary grade helicopter blades (yes, along with some materials to prevent or cause flex in certain areas, but that is not an option for gears).

If heat is not much of an issue with gear drives, could wrapping or lining the gear box with Dynamat or some kind of sound absorbing material help? I'm torn between loving the geared Tie Fighter sound, but also wanting to be able to run stealth FOC mode.

Thatâ€™s a great idea, first thing should be measure and analyze the spectrum of the current gear drives to see where is the problem

Decreasing the gear pitch and increasing number of teeth will increase the fundamental pitch, doing the opposite will obviously lower it. I donâ€™t know if the fundamental is the main source of noise or some of the harmonics

Oil is great to dampen everything, but the denser the oil more losses will happen

@Mobutusan do you have an idea of the thickness of these sound dampeners? Itâ€™s the same thing they use in car audio? Maybe that with a thin oil would work

Itâ€™s not fun then you bottom out top speed 20 times on the way to work

That just means you have PLENTY of power, which is never bad.  Topping-out keeps you from going dangerous speed and keeps your braking distance shorter, anyway.

I haven't used Dynamat myself, but it's pretty thin stuff, like 1.5-2mm thick. I just came across this stuff too that looks interesting.

Noise... Who cares. Go ride.

Most people can't even build a silent build to the point all they hear is bearings(no rattles or creaks). Little motor/gear whine never hurt anybody, and if anything it makes people get out of my way.

Also white lithium + proper backlash will make a gearbox no louder then belts. Belts are a lower octave, gearboxes are a higher octave. 

If you're measuring sound off of a recording, it's because microphones pick up higher pitch better than lower pitch. Do some real world comparisons. Not video comparisons

As a sound engineer I can tell you it's not the video the problem, it's human ears. They are just designed and unprotected for high frequency.that's why we can stand very powerful bass and a baby crying is annoying as fuck. 
Silence is really good... Since I've been riding Carvon's each time I'm on my belt drive It feels akward to have so much noise coming from belts.
