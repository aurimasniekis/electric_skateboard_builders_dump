I ordered from MBS US, and used YouShop to get reasonable shipping to NZ (MBS was going to charge $600 for shipping!!!!)

Still not cheap, and you might get pinged extra for the weight, but might work out cheaper.

I ordered 8inch wheels with rockstar hubs and matrix trucks, and was stupid enough to put it in one order so had to pay GST. Excluding the GST, the heavy weight put the shipping cost up to $75NZ. Orders over $80US get free shipping within the US from MBS, so that $75 was the total shipping cost. For just a set of off-road wheels you'd be looking at $20-$30NZ I reckon. YouShop is great, I use them for loads of stuff.

Yep, YouShop gives you an address with an id code at their US based warehouse. Then you get an email when it shows up, pay for the shipping to NZ and they send it over. Only problem is waiting that extra week or so while it takes a detour to the US warehouse.
Looks like they are $69 USD on the MBS US site, so you'd definitely get them cheaper that way than the $130US from Australia.

Just need the weight and dimensions as a 50cm√ó50cm box that weighs 1kg says it would be over $100 shipped.

Just ask MBS. It would be way less than that though, as I said my order for much larger/heavier stuff came to $75.
