Hey eSK8ers / e-ATBers!

Has anyone ever played the game S.K.A.T.E?  For those who haven't it's an old skool skateboard game where someone sets the trick and others have to copy it.  If you can't match the trick you get a letter.  The last person to spell SKATE wins.

To make this more fun and fairer we've changed the rules for this platfom:

**The Rules**
1. A trick is set and everyone else aims to copy the trick.  
2. Upload a video of the successfully copied trick followed by all of the failed attempts so we can all have a bit of a laugh!
3. The first person to upload the successfully copied trick sets the next trick.
4. For each trick you successfully complete you EARN a letter.
5. The first person to copy 5 successful tricks earning S, K, A, T, E is the winner.
6. Players can join at any stage of the game and copy any of the set tricks - if they can post a video copying a trick then they pick up a letter and are added to the leaderboard. They can then continue to match any of the other tricks to earn additional letters and catch up :wink: 

NOTE:  For all entries to count you MUST wear a helmet at a bare minimum!  

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

***** **LEADERBOARD** *****


Current Leader: @rich  - the first person to get A.  Killing the game, and his board, in persuit of S.K.A.T.E awesomeness!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**TRICKS SET SO FAR**

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**The first trick: Ollie Something**


https://youtu.be/NRIA--5MX44

This is a straight forward Ollie over an inamimate (or animate!) object of your choosing!  All you have to do is jump over it!  This should hopefully get some names chalked up on the leaderboard!  It's also possible that an esk8er could take this one out first and set a non-strapped in trick too!  Let's see what happens :metal:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Second trick: Nollie**

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nf47iz_GObI

Great progression from the Ollie set by @amecces.  Can't wait to see the videos for this roll in! 


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Third trick: Switch Nollie**

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRoz6TtkXrE

@DeathCookies taking the Nollie and switching that sh*t up!  Nice variation as we get to experiment with a set up 180 or nose roll too ;-)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Third trick: Drift Circle**

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4JwV8mlNag

@rich mixing things up and taking full advantage of our off-road beasts!   This is so rad, and looks pretty damn hard if I'm honest!  I've abbreviated it to **360 Drift!** ;-)


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

BONUS TRICK!

**Nose Roll 180**
This trick was originally set as the first trick but it proved to be really tricky on an e-ATB so we're gonna park it for now!!  If anyone does manage to do it though you get a letter and the pretigious title of eMTB God!!

In the video below Dylan Warren teaches a buddy how to Nose Roll 180 on a mountainboard - fast forward to the 3:55 mark to see the trick:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIaYmEp3HZw

The video teaches the whole trick - frontside and backside.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

S.K.A.T.E ON Brothers and Sisters!

Apologies for anyone I've missed btw - I could only tag 10 people in the post, but anyone with a mountainboard should try this! :wink:

@trampa, @TarzanHBK, @squad,  @laurnts, @Okami, @Kaly, @Mox, @whitepony 

@Deckoz, @Riako - have you guys got boards yet?  You guys have been pretty active too :heart_eyes:

First of all this seems like a nice idea. It is kinda useless because we cannot judge if it was the first or the 50000 try but i Keep watching this battle. 


[quote="DanSkates, post:1, topic:52423"]
So to start of the game of S.K.A.T.E I challenge all MTB and eMTBers to try and nail this trick in no more than 5 trys.

Thats the nice sentence everyone tells but in the end you are cheating to yourself AND to the others.

I am really tempted to take part of the challenge. It is fun with a snowboard but i never tried it with a mtb or emtb. probably gonna stick to a mtb for this trick to have a balanced board. Makes it easier. Maybe a bit cheating but we do not have any rules yet :D

edit: no rules except getting the trick fluid.

I ride goofy, so that makes it worst to lift left leg higher :smiley:

We put Matt and Andy on a single drive, small battery, two 6S 6200mAh Lipos. The pump track they rocked doesn't consume a lot of battery. It's more about the better flow and extra e-boost to nail the jumps faster and higher. After one hour of riding the battery was still half full. The twin is to heavy for that kind of action. 
Next thing on the list: Electric backflip on a big ramp.

No deadline as such - unless this goes for a couple of weeks without a successful trick in which case we'll pick another trick!  I've woken up this morning feeling bloody awful so it might be a few days before I can try it now :frowning:

@trampa I'm not entirely sure you've understood the nature of the game!! :sweat_smile:  the video you post should be 

1. of you, and 
2. of the trick set in the previous video!  

...that said this is a beauty of a 360.  Those guys are seriously next level - bet you're glad you signed them.  Looking forward to seeing what they can do on these things.

That's all good - they can totally function as seperate topics.  This one is supposed to be a game of SKATE - the purpose is to help push each other and encourage our group development but it's also to have a bit of fun trying to better each others tricks and just have a bit of a laugh :smile:

Hey Dan, I will definitely take the challenge!!! 

But I would like change the rules:

* With every trick anyone copies successfully he/she EARNS a letter (or point if this challenge lasts longer :) )

* The uploaded video should start with the successful try (to make it more interesting for others) and should be followed by all the fails on the way to it, even if it takes more than 5 tries. (This way it is easier not to cheat, because as said earlier no one can judge how many tries there were before. And we see more fails ;-) )

* The first who stands the trick sets the new trick. Others still get points for copying the trick or simply get no points for skipping a trick.

* If anyone joins the challenge later, he/she just has to follow up by copying the until then set tricks.

It would be great if you could update the first post with a list of the tricks and the succeeders to make it easier for everyone.

Something like:
* **Noseroll + 180°** - set by @DanSkates
  Accompished by: @...

Maybe you should even rename the tread to "S.K.A.T.E **Challenge** - Upload your trick vids!" to get more attention.

I like that idea, this way you have endless tries (or shall it be limited to 1000? ) :joy:
But it would be interesting to know which try succeed (e.g. No. 23,  can be written in video description), followed by all the fails. 

I'm sure my video would be movie length because I can't even nose roll.....

I bet @Duffman  wins the first challenge :wink:

Well, we will try to stipulate some serious E-MTB action and show people what setup we use for that kind of action. I think the boards for doing tricks need to be tuned specifically for that. Doing a nose 180 wants a very balanced and light board. People tend to overpower their boards...

If the back is heavier u just Need to pull your leg stronger. The board does not Need to be tuned specifically for a nose roll. It makes it easier but it is not neccessary though...

Furthermore I think with a liitle pratice any pro freestyle rider could do almost any trick, 740's, 1080's, backflips, whatever only depending on the size of the kicker. Even with a 12s8p and 80mm motors. But IMO the battery should be in the middle.

I think this is all really healthy discussion. The talk is generally around the mechanics/operation of the board but now we have boards we can ride it’s right we think about how boards can be optimised for different situations. For example all my kicker vids have been with x4 6s lipos - I only need x2 and could even get away with x1 6s if I changed my settings.  I’ll defo think about this for future vids. It’s probably important that we start to build with this in mind. If I did wanna flick over to a 6s setting, I should have a phone app with a preloaded setting so I can change between optimised ride modes...for example

I think i heard @NoWind say that he has a seperate 8S Freestyle Board that runs with a single Lipo, maybe some insight into that would be interesting for this style of riding.

As for me, i really like the idea of this thread but it will be a while until i can even remotely compete, didn't manage to get a lot of kilometers on my board yet :laughing:

Now I got my bindings just right (took a while of ride to find the best standing posture), doing jump is now not as hard and as imbalance as before. Still I think weight management to get the balance just right is crucial before doing any tricks.

Totally true. That is the reason that a nose role 180 is the worst trick for the beginning of a game of skate...

the trick itself is hard and normaly most People only have 2wd which makes the Balance Problems even harder....

You could be right - I haven't tried it yet.  But that's half the fun!  Look at the video of @duffman - he makes nose rolls look easy :)  I guess the only way to find out is to try.  Half of the idea of this topic is to help each other improve whilst having fun at the same time.  We all learn how to build from each other - now it's time to learn to ride from each other.  :

Thanks for the invitation, but personally staying with my four wheels on the ground as much as possible. 37 with fucked up knees from judo and wintersport. Already walk around like a grandpa for a day after a 20 km ride. One wrong move and I fear it's over, especially with the weight of these boards. I personally like carving and improving my off-road speed as much as possible. 

Looking forward to the vids though.

Didn't actually see the full description of the initial trick challenge at first...
As a mountainboarder, I can tell you all, nose rolls are fairly easy to pick up, both frontside and backside. But fluid noseroll 180s (without touching down after the noseroll) are a lot harder. A lot harder. Good luck for all your attempts those that will be trying!

Too easy bro!
At least an eMTB handstand strapped in bindings and with wristguards :laughing:

If I understand the rules correctly to be part of the game you have to upload a video. If you succeed you get a letter (and set the next trick), but to stay in game you have to upload a video, even when it contains fails only. Otherwise you can't continue the game but can win a letter with another trick. Maybe there is a half letter for the best fail video? This way more people could contribute for fun even when they know they can't succeed a trick. 

Another option would be to start with easier tricks first and keep the fluid nose roll 180 for the letter "E". So the winner of the whole challenge must succeed this trick in the end.


After the S.K.A.T.E challenge we could do a J.U.M.P challenge :metal:

I can do it for days on my snowboard so just figured this would be similar - perhaps I picked too much of a tough one for the first trick.  I'm happy to set something easier if people would prefer?  Maybe just an ollie over a stuffed toy to get people warmed up!!! :smile:

Dude I'm totally with you!  I'm 36 and my body hurts like hell most of the time - it's only my chriopractor that keeps me moving around!  

There could easily be a trick for a powerslide or something cruisy though...let's see what the next trick is!

If I understand the rules correctly to be part of the game you have to upload a video. If you succeed you get a letter (and set the next trick), but to stay in game you have to upload a video, even when it contains fails only. Otherwise you can’t continue the game but can win a letter with another trick.
[/quote]

I reckon we should be more flexible on this rule.  Typically in S.K.A.T.E everyone has a crack at the trick, but as we're playing via correspondance perhaps people could just try any trick at any point and get a letter if they can copy one and post the vid?  So maybe change rule '6'?  Somehting more like:

"6. Players can join at any stage of the game and copy any of the set tricks - if they can post a video copying a trick then they pick up a letter and are added to the leaderboard.  They can then continue to match any of the other tricks to earn additional letters and catch up"

All the drama over this trick has made me even more desperate to try it!!!  So much so I'm gonna throw on some pads and give it a crack in the backyard in the dark!  I'll try and got a couple of lights out too so it shows up on film.  If it is totally impossible for us all at this stage I'll set something easier.  Fuck it, If I crack it I'll set something easier anyway and if people do manage this trick at a later stage then they get the letter.  It probabaly shouldn't matter if you do the tricks out of order, you'll still be picking up letters in sequence and it's then first one then to post 5 successful tricks that becomes the winner.  I'm certain there will be tricks that some people can do that others can't and others that those people can do that the first lot can't.  I suck at backflips for example!!! :rofl::rofl::rofl:

As promised I tried it yesterday, but I couldn't do a fluent noseroll 180°, yet...

A noseroll is easy, a 180° is easy, but combinig those is hard, as you would have to get the energy to jump off with your front foot and lift the whole board weight after you almost finish the first trick...

And of course I made a video: :sunglasses:

SHIT YEAH!!!!

Duuuuude!  I'm loving the effort - you're sooooooo close!  Regardless of whether you got it all in one go the riding was awesome!  Like you said you have the nose roll and 180 perfectly!

...so...I just tried too!  In the dark.  I got close.  But same as you couldn't get the whole thing in one go - @AndyBigD you're totally right buddy - that's bloody hard!  I recorded mine too, I'll edit tomorrow night as it's 11pm here now.  Annoyingly the motor gear came loose after a load of tries so then I spent the rest of the time trying to do it from standstill!!  Unlike you're awesome riding I have ALOT of fails to share with you guys! :sweat_smile::crazy_face:

Hopefully the footage comes out as it was dark under house lighting.

I'll fix my board and try again in a couple of days time!

Damn this is fun! :smile:

I was motivated and tried some stuff today. I did not really get it but i want to share my experience with you!

Like i mentioned earlier is that trick especially hard for most people who will try it!
Most riders use a Dual Rear Drive (unbalanced board) which needs to be lifted for a 180 and then lift even higher to make a nollie 180... well. The board is unbalanced and you need to pull the heavy side. Have fun :smiley:
here is an example picture of my mount: 
 ![1ae32e2e07f5c35f01b437c4e3ab4f0b4c3ca6d3_1_690x431[1]|690x431](upload://5WsQUJWrNnQnSTQbGwhD9AJwzbO.jpg)

I already knew that i will get a hard time with my heavy mount and with two sk3 6374 motors. It seemed so easy when @Duffman or @DanSkates gave it a try. but i know that @Duffman is running smaller motors and heelstraps. That is a big advantage.
 
Never the less I never tried noserolls with an mtb or emtb just with snowboards. So i want to give it a try. In the first part i tried it with my emtb without heelstraps and without reverse... then i set up my board with can and reverse. 

Maybe when i attach my heelstraps to my emtb i will give it another try. without i dont think i will make it with this board (heavy mount, motors).

But enough talking. just watch yourself my progress:

@DeathCookies great effort bro!  You really got close without the extra weight!

@amecces - I love that all your videos are in dirt!!  It's truely what these beasts are designed for!  We need to get some of your jump videos up!  Nice try on the trick, but it's bloody hard work to lift that tail.  It probabaly took me 20 attempts before I got used to lifting the extra weight - you really have to get your weight over the front foot and try to move your body, rather than the board.

---------*****    TRICK RESET!!!!    *****------------

OK, so the Nose Roll 180 is a bit too tough right now for most people, and the idea of SKATE is that you start small and build up to harder tricks.  So, with that in mind I've reset the trick to something way easier - the humble ollie!

TRICK SET:  Ollie Something.
Ollie whatever you like!!  The sillier the better! :dog:

https://youtu.be/NRIA--5MX44

First person to upload their Ollie gets to set the next trick.  You have 1 week from posting your successful Ollie to posting the new trick to set.  If it takes longer the next person to post can upload theirs to keep the momentum going.

This trick may actually open things up to eSK8ers to if they have a kicktail :crazy_face:

Once the entries start flowing in I'll create a leaderboard.  I'll update the first post with this trick too.

OLLIE OLLIE OLLIE OI OI OI!!!

I'm quite glad I recorded all of the attempts as you can see I was completely useless at the beginning and it doesn't look possible to the end where I'm almost able to do it.  I'll keep trying this each time I get out.  I'm sure I'll be able to get it with enough pratice :crazy_face:

Nice one dude! Good progress and very close at the end! I reckon a bit of forward momentum will help you out... Use the motors to get a little roll going then try it, I reckon you'll have it 👌
And if you can find anywhere with a little drop down or bank try it off the end/top, makes that last 180 a bit easier to get round...

I'm defo gonna try this!  I have the perfect bank in mind to try it out.  Wanna run my smaller kicker off the bank and get some 3s happening too.  Would love to then build up to some bigger spins - these boards are built for freestyle!!

Gonna head over to your thread to see how you're getting on!  Do you have any of your moutainboard races or freestyle on film?  Would love to see that :star_struck:

Not much progress in my thread lately, just been on holiday and still waiting for lots of parts. Currently trying to plan my wiring.

Go on YouTube and search "ATBA UK 2016".
That's the last major event I competed in and there's a good selection of videos from that.

In fact just this weekend we had the 1st UK comp of the year, the series is called Rhythm Cross where we race on BMX tracks, 14 riders so fairly small but I ended up claiming the Open title 😀🤘
There's a video of last years final at the same place where I got 4th (behind the Brind brothers in 1st & 3rd);

The level you guys ride at is insane.  I can't believe it's taking me this long to find mountainboarding!  I would have LOVED this when I was living in the UK.  I instead spent my teens rollerblading, snakeboarding and skating and picked up snowboarding and wakeboarding in my 20s.   Then in my 30s moved over to kitesurfing and now esk8!  I love learning new sports though and the mountainboard is startin to feel really 'homely' now if you know what i mean?  Looking forward to exploring more in this sport.

For every trick you successfully complete you earn a letter.  So you just earned an 'S' - the first letter of the word SKATE.  The first person to earn all 5 letters to spell S.K.A.T.E wins the challenge.

BTW - as you were the first person to upload the successful trick you get to set the next one :wink:

What will it be??  I'm excited for it!

Totally forgot the rules :laughing: I'm curious, too.

There is one thing which I don't understand because there are 2 ways to set a new trick.
If you set a trick which you can't do yet  (e.g. Noseroll 180) you earn a letter after upload of the succeeded trick. If you set a new trick with a own video (e.g. Ollie Something) you can't earn a letter or already earned it?
```

Yeah good point!  Usually with SKATE the idea is that you don’t wanna earn letters but as we’ve switched the rules for this platform it makes it a bit more confusing.  

I only uploaded the nose roll 180 that someone else did, so that I could participate and to make it an even playing field, but really the first trick now is the Ollie.  I reckon the rule should be that if you match a trick you get a letter and then if you’re the first to upload you set the next trick and also earn a letter for loading up a successful trick.  In this sense, @amecces has an S for matching it (as will anyone else who uploads an ollie video) and then when @amecces uploads a new video he instantly gets a K (taking him to the top of the leader board).  The first person to then load a copy of his trick gets a letter, and they set the next trick too and so on…

Yes that was a sneaky nollie, but I need to make some nicer and higher ones and will then upload a proper video to comply with the rules...

The 2Wheel needs A LOT of practice because you have to forget everything you know about steering and balance from skateboarding and do everything with the front wheel. On flat roads it is O.K. to ride but on medium inclines up or down it is less fun because your center of gravity changes. That either means that go go into a wheelie and cannot steer because your frontwheel is in the air or your COG is over your front wheel and you cannot lift it for steering ;-)
You more or less just ride on your back wheel and only tip the front wheel to the ground to steer and keep balance...

I wanted to buy a original 2WheelBoard, but never received an answer to my emails. So I had to build it completely from scratch. The board is made from my 'old' MBS Core 94 deck with lots of glass fiber and epoxy... I started with a VESC6 SK3-6374 encoder setup but later switched to a sensored RC ESC because the plain old dutycycle control feels much better on this board than current control.

There is no build thread yet, but I should definitely make one... sometime...

That's just crazeeeee dude - I'm confident you could build anything!!! :smile:  Would love to see the build log, and would love to ride that thing!  How does it compare in feeling to a snowboard?  I guess the positioning of the wheels is the biggest difference as you've said.  Maybe a longer deck would help?

You've been added to the leaderboard bro!  You're currently 3rd - get the Nollie recorded and you'll be boosted to first place and get to set the next trick too!  @duffman, technically has nollied in a video but he wants to upload a better one to comply with the rules.  The first one of you guys to do it will get the next trick to set and the top spot!  Who will it be???  I love a good friendly competition! :sunglasses:

For anybody trying to find the inspiration to ride, I've been following an MTB (mountain bike!) guy called Sam Pilgrim and he just uploaded a first person perspective video of a recent big air tournement he entered - The Swatch Rocket Air Mountain Bike Slopestyle contest.

It's cool to see the course ridden and his emotions through the tournment.  REALLY makes me wanna compete in something like this!  Who knows, maybe in a couple of years there will be an electric boards version of this?

It took me 2 days to learn the nollie, it was so strange to put the weight above the front wheels. 80% in this video are fake nollies because my ass is above the rear wheels but it's the complete chronologic record of the evolution of my nollies :laughing:

To succeed yo have to drift at least one full circle without touching the ground.

Nice work @rich. Congrats on taking the lead. 

Just thinking aloud, but what would also be great, for people like me, is to have a bit of an explanation of how the trick can be accomplished. The latest one for example (drifting a circle), are you applying more power in certain places? are you pushing out with your back foot, etc.

Kinda like an instructional video. Probably best done once a few more people upload their attempts, then the 'laggers' like me can also try, and fail.

It's not easy (at least for me) but it helped a lot for getting a better feeling for the board (and how it reacts). 

[quote="ArnhemAnt, post:144, topic:52423"]
are you applying more power in certain places? are you pushing out with your back foot, etc.
[/quote]

Basically I put more weight on the front foot and additional lean more to the front, pushing a bit out with the back foot also helps. It is important to loose weight on the back foot paired with extreme lean to get less traction on the rear wheels. I started with the smallest possible circle without drifting, then apply just a little bit more throttle until the rear wheels start to loose traction and drift (and keep the throttle in this position). While drifting I also lean more than before to get smaller circles and loose further traction. It is a lot about balancing and keeping the right throttle position.

It's a very thin line between fame and shame :rofl:

If you're finding it tough, firming up your rear dampas might help ArnyBro?

Just like a dirt bike firming up the rear will make it easier to pop the front and break rear traction...

Funny you mention the analogy with dirt bikes. I've been riding my WR450 for over a year now, with no suspension. Both front forks and rear shock are stuffed. I've sent it all away to get a complete rebuild and expect to be riding again in about a fortnight. Going to be kinda weird to ride the bike again with working suspension.

Ok, i try to explain. I made a 180 like in the video, easy. The following happened, my body was still in rotation when the front wheels first touched the ground. The board has stopped the rotation but my Body does not, so nothing special done. The ribbons in the left knee are overstretched. except practice, probably better without kicker, I do not know how to prevent it. physical fitness, we're not the youngest anymore

It's predictable if you keep the exact same body position, same throttle and if the surface is always the same :rofl: Also it's different on changing terrains. I'm still a beginner in drifting, this were my first 360 drifts ever.

No more rotations :laughing:
But joking aside you make me think about if it is a good idea to do rotations at higher jumps because it is risky (at least for us, the young at heart). Instead we could develop new tricks like clap one's hands in the air :rofl:

So whilst we're all healing, repairing our boards or waiting for that next free weekend to ride here's a new video from Australian Mountainboarders to get your juices flowing.  Skip to the 9:15 mark if you wanna jump straight into the event with all the tricks!  There's some pretty sweet freestyle in this one!

They are still waiting on me and some other persons to heal up. Very Kind of them!

I still have to upload my drift Video. It is old and lame but it is still okay though. 

IMO you can get onboard! You just need to upload every Trick we have commited ;)
