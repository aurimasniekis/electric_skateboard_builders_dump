I can only imagine how much money I have saved in not using my car and mostly using my e board . I have 1000's of miles on my board now and it's still going strong. I get to work on it and to the store every day. It's so much fun too ride and people always ask if I built it and tell me how cool it is. I can ride 80 miles on one charge and it has a top speed I'm to scared to reach lol.

[/quote]

Are you sure about that? The biggest battery packs I've seen are offering around 30-35 miles per charge. Let's not misinform the masses here.

While it is possible to fit an 80 mile pack on a board, i doubt it actually happened. We're talking around 120-160 quality 18650 cells, so you're looking at one of my giant packs plus another one and another two thirds of one which could actually fit on a longer top mount with one ESC. Maybe. Possibly. 

I'd like to see some pics.

He might have a giant lipo pack, and doesn't go very fast on his board plus is skating on flat ground. And might be light as a fiddle :smile:?

I've actually wanted to try that for a while... imagine going cross country with an electric skateboard, charging it in hotels or even camping and using a solar system with a deep cycle battery to charge!

a prismatic pack of that watt hour range would dwarf an 18650 pack of the same watt-hours and likely wouldn't fit on the board. Every time i unpack a lipo or shop for prismatics i find myself disappointed again that they don't actually save you any space while still being far more puncture prone as well as sag prone. And often more expensive by the time its all said and done.

I estimated 29.6miles at 185lb rider with 40 (10s4p) Sanyo 20700B’s on the esk8 calc. Mooch showed the test results at 3989mah or something at 10amp continuous. They are sold and labeled 4250mah but I calculated with 4000mah. Mooch also got 3800mah+ at 15a continuous. 

You can get fit those doubled stack under a deck with say 45mm depth adding a thin enclosure for 80 cells. 50-60 Miles.  

Going over 40in deck and larger wheels like pneumatics gives you even more room, area of deck and depth to go down stacking. 

Triple stack as described is at 90miles+/- from increasing weight and other variable. Also pnuematics if used would decrease more (not sure if those urethane airless tires are near as efficient as regular wheels. )

so 29.6v x 18 ah (90%) = 532.8 wh.

Would say 54 km should be possible.. though that would be around 33 miles i believe.. maybe in eco mode you could push till 40 miles.. / 65 km..

That is then a 8S with 20 Ah. So that's then 592 wh which will get you on flat and decent speed about 50 - 60 km.
I beat that by 1036 wh (12S8P 30Q) in my street Board. Could get 100 km on a charge at decent speed. At all-in mode in my area it is good for 80 km.
At doggy jogging speed i could reach 160 km (100 miles) because then it only uses 6 wh/km. But I guess my dog never want's to proof that.
But it is great to have a battery where you never need to think about it if the range is good enough for the Tour. You will give up before the Board does.
But 500 wh are also enough for that.

Oh and on average LiPos are 50 % heavier than Li-Ion

I was throwing out possible answers, that's all. I saw in a thread he posted, dated ages ago, that he had been looking at using those multistar lipos, so I kind of assumed he went with those. I'm in the same boat with everyone else though...I find 80miles a little hard to swallow. And I did the math twice, just in case. But in the end, he still saved money on gas by not using his car. :thumbsup: 

Prismatic cells...100%. I researched those and holy CRAP those are HUGE! At least the ones I was looking at....made me want to cry.

I road from San Diego to San Marcos and back on one charge. It's a 38 mile ride by freeway but I was back and forth on side streets that added an extra 4 miles to the trip. 40 miles there and 40 miles back. The batteries never gave out on me and when I charged them back up they both took near 19,000 mAh each.

Going to back the original topic about gas money saved by taking esk8.

I'm a student but during the summer holidays I work and in order to get there I take the bus which would cost me $7 each day (not a lot) but when you start to add that up over time I ended up saving a decent amount of money (helped justifying splashing out on an esk8). 

When you add it up $7 a day * 5 days a week = $35 a week * 4 weeks = $140 a month

Over a few months I've started to payback some of my board plus travelling becomes really fun :)

For me it’s not gas it’s public transportation or traditional scooter in Paris. 

It’s 70 € a month for all bus, trams , subway. 

My scooter was 1200 € + 15 € of gas each week + 30 € of insurance each month and approx 500 € of maintenance and repair every 2 years. Not to mention bills you can get for wrong parking etc.

So my first board was like no expense since i sold my scooter and built one !

I can't even understand how that's possible. You must have the world's most efficient esk8 and weigh like 40kg! That's also an insanely long trip. How did your legs hold out?

What do you guys use for commuting on rainy days and in winter?
I use my esk8 regular to work and back - but only when there's good weather. It's fall here, I'll grind as much as I could into the winter but below 0C degrees I won't even bother anymore - public transportation is the logical answer but I really dislike to depend on it.... :)

Personnaly only rain stop me. Even when it’s below 0 i take the board since taking the subway would mean triple my commute time. Just a good coat with gloves and full face helmet and you can’t be cold. 

Rain is a bummer, at my early stage of eskating few years ago i would take the board with rain but with all the problems with bearings and stuff it’s a bad idea. So when it rains I take the subway. But it’s a bummer. If i could commute everyday on esk8 i would !

Money is one of the reasons.... but the real point for me is RIDE& NO PARKING. Those make worth it sk8 instead of cars.

Especially the ride home is best part of the esk8 commute :) haha

Do your batteries sag more in the cold? They don't have as much performance/juice under zero degrees C.

Every ride is the best ride haha 
Even more since I have those V3. Seriously I just can’t get over it, I feel like I’m on my old longboard... but I have breaks and can hit 50 km/h easily. no noise and smoothness is everything.. 

About sag I can only tell with my belt set Up from last winter. And i would estimate the drop in range of 10 - 15 % in my case. I think that you don’t lose much because you store your board inside at ambiant temp so the 15 - 20 mins ride I do wouldn t do much. 
With 10S3P for 7,6 km with lots of hills on my way in normal temps i end up with ( almost everyday ) 60 % ( belt or carvon V3 apparently the efficiency is the same ) 
During Winter it’s more like 50 - 45 % 

With belt drive with 25r cell i would sag at around 30 % with the V3 the sag is from 60 - 50 % and it’s very annoying. I have to finish the build for my V3 soon so i can finaly enjoy the drives at their full potential.

A good solution would be to go at least 10S4P or even 5P...I do around 7 km daily too, my route to and from work (no hills) consumes around 1Ah or roughly 1V from the battery. I charge my 10S4P 12Ah to about 41.4V so I can easily make it through the week with one charge and still have around 36V left. 33V is the lowest I’m comfortable going. 
So that’s around 40-50km of range with dual 6355 190V in foc and 97mm abecs. 

Big wheels keep on turning 😀

Eager to find out what winter conditions will bring though.

I have not mentioned that the V3 are hooked up to another board while I finish the 12S5P for the carvon. I will have 30Q cells so i shouldn’t have any sag. I just couldnt resist when i recieved them and I had to use it !!

@Crossfire Well I live in the country and drive ~60km to work every day (takes about 35-40 minutes). I just park in the Coles carpark next to my work building and usually there's only 1 or 2 cars in the whole carpark, so I always get my spot. Pay parking also just isn't a thing in a town this big. If I could esk8 to work I would (even if only to avoid the ~$70/week fuel cost). Maybe one day if I move into town I will. For now my Audi makes for a fast and comfortable ride to work.
