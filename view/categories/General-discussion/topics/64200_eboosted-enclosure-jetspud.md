I wanted to know peoples experience with eboosted enclosures. 

I’m pretty disappointed because I spent almost $200 on a JetSpud DS enclosure from Eboosted’s site, and it didn’t even fit the board or double stacked cells as advertised :/.

![image|375x500](upload://6KMCvXpOPxyeAAdKIPLEhoaQtTX.jpeg)![image|375x500](upload://6EDnSghIMpd3kaFEAzgWZE39Vxw.jpeg)![image|374x500](upload://l0LspAPvwqibyIuujFpuPyL73xB.jpeg)

Basically the first two photos show that the enclosure is too long, and the last photo shows my double stacked battery pack and how shallow the enclosure is compared to the depth of the battery.

I'm using a single stack enclosure and it fits alright. The edge of the enclosure is dead close to the truck baseplate or riser, and that's how it should be. Perhaps you should drop him a PM and see what he can do to help.

@Baswoods the enclosure has been designed to use the longer wheelbase holes, as you know the spud has a pretty short wheelbase and every milimiter counts to fit a bigger battery and electronics, that's why I took this decision. 

I see you used the inner position base plate holes for shorter wheel base and sealed the outter holes with car paint filler.

Drill the holes back and mount the trucks in the outter position and it will fit like a glove. 

Please let me know if you need any help with that.

I didn’t do any of what you said. What you circled is dirt from my riser pad, I’m using the max wheelbase on the board.

Is that a 2nd hand board because that sure looks like filler in those holes? These enclosures have been used time and time again and have proven to be perfect.

Also seems odd that there are riser hole marks further than the outmost position :thinking:

Maybe you should just fill in the holes that making the enclosure not fit properly & drill out the ones that were filled to get the proper fit??

If you say so than ok.
But why the enclosure fit to the encarves for the wheels like it’s made for it?🤔
Don’t get me wrong but @Eboosted usually use one template for every version of deck. 
So they all the same size and they fit other guys decks which have the same as you...

Looking at @Linny pic the trucks are a lot further towards the end of the board...which is allowing the enclosure to fit properly...

Or as there are no holes according to his words, just drill holes that would fit the enclosure.
Easy peasy😅

And if the enclosure is made to fit a specific wheel base that information should be in the description for when someone is purchasing the product. 

![image|281x500](upload://3fe1JP4Ik3J1og7OcyBAstMnoML.png)

There’s no we’re in here that states that there’s a specific wheel base it was made for so I suggest it be adding in for future reference instead of suggesting that people remove nonexistent filler.

Wow man just relax. We don’t hate on you, just discussing what you can make to fit the enclosure. 
I said you, you know batter than we if there holes or not.
And to drill new holes looks for me as the easiest option. If this is possible, again only you can measure out.


Just hope you got to @Eboosted before you opened this thread. He usually stand behind his product and I see here on the forum that he always willing to give advice or help if something don’t fit 100%.

Lol, my thoughts precisely! This thread irritates me. I vote close it! 

@BasWoods , if you buy a product from someone on this forum, it's considered "polite" (and a rule) that the best practice is to PM the seller for a resolution FIRST,  and preferably in a polite manner,  before starting a thread that annoys me (or others). I'd wish you luck, but I don't care

Okay. And no one is being rude, I’m just sharing a problem and purchase experience. Thank you for helping me with a solution, that’s exactly what this chat is for, but I’m making people aware that if they buy a Jetspud enclosure from eboosted it might not fit. 

What if I’m a customer who doesn’t want to drill through my board? Then there should be information states what the specifications of the enclosure are, and if there’s a possibility it won’t fit. 

Instead all I see are messages with false information and complaints that I stated a problem.

Just seems odd. The spud is a very popular board. And he's sold more than a few enclosures.

Very odd, i'm using the same enclosure and deck as you, it should fit but the rear truck will be pretty much touching the edge of the enclosure

[/quote]

Then the deck is the problem not the enclosure.  Here's how you resolve your issues...

1. Take the baseplate and move it out to where the outside holes should be
2. Mark the holes and drill
3. Move the trucks to where they should be and remount
4. Move the enclosure to where it should be and remount
5. Apologize to @Eboosted for being a dick 
6. Change the thread title to "my deck is weird so I made stupid assumptions and insulted an entire community of people who wanted nothing more than to help me"

@BasWoods the folks here on the board are trying to help you. They don't have the deck in front of them, so they are basing their comments on the information you've provided. In the pics here it does look like the holes were filled, and that's a reasonable guess because (at lease some) models of the jet spud have multiple wheel base options.

You should have reached out to the vendor before declaring disappointment publicly. We all understand that it is frustrating to spend money and then not get the result you were hoping for, but it's better to approach the issue with an aim to solve the problem, rather than bashing the vendor because you ran into a problem. @Eboosted is a known entity here that does great work. We'll take down this thread once the problem is resolved. If you want to post again, describing the incompatibility between the version of the deck you have, and the enclosure you purchased - that's useful for folks to know!

Practical advice: drill the holes and get riding!

Im gonna take this one topic at a time...  Im sorry if I hurt your feelings.  I wont quote all the different ways you offended and insulted people here, but suffice it to say that calling you a dick was not a curse and was simply meant to get you to stop and think about what you were doing.

@Eboosted has made dozens if not hundreds of enclosures for people on this forum and none have had any major complaints, very few complaints at all.  So when a new guys shows up and start digging at someone who assists and helps our little community we tend to get defensive.   

You may be 12 years old, I don't know, but on the internet your an adult no matter your physical age.  When you disrespect some, just like in the real world, that person and those people associated with them, are free to disrespect you in turn.  Own it.

Im done, but IMO you need to apologize to @Eboosted.

I shipped the guy a deck, and waited months for the enclosure to be made. When it finally arrived, it showed up taped together with 3 other enclosures that I had to distribute, and my deck. Adding to my frustration was the fact that Alan messaged me on WhatsApp while he was at the airport in Mexico. For some reason he was outside of the secured area, and they wouldn't let him back in with my deck. He had to check it. In order to check it, he had to pay $60. He messages me asking what he should do. He didn't want to toss it. :roll_eyes:

Anyway, turns out my enclosure had bubbles on the surface, and the interior showed random shaped sheets of fiberglass layed up, as it if were made out of leftover scrap. 

Many other folks have said that his enclosures don't fit well, but "don't want to vendor bash". One of those guys is in this thread (not defending him)!

Alan DID refund me though. After I paid him via friends and family. But his refund was sent as if it were goods and services, so I wound up paying for my refund. :man_shrugging:

This isn’t a one time issue. I myself had that exact problem using @JLabs deck with @Eboosted enclosure. Alan was nice enough to refund me so I didn’t make a big deal out of it. I personally know @BasWoods and he isn’t a “dick” like some of the others here claims.

I’m seriously disappointed. Between @Maxaweli battery issue and @BasWoods enclosure issue I noticed a lot of the veterans jump to vendors defense right out the bat without all the info. It especially makes a difference because I know those guys personally and they’re really the nicest people I’ve met, nothing like everyone here are describing them to be. @onloop @treenutter

Hey Bro,

All good to be a bit upset. But you don't have any context. That would make it difficult for you to understand why everybody jumped on ya. 
@Eboosted is one of the most helpful, and talented vendors on this forum, who makes an amazing product. @mmaner is like Santa, he helps everybody on this forum with everything in any way he can, he's likely given away over a grand worth of parts just to help people get on the road. But he's also like that uncle who takes zero shit and defends righteously those he feels are being slighted. In this case you sort of crossed a line opening a thread wanting to discuss your issues with the product you bought from @Eboosted. 
The reason this got ugly fast, is this isn't the first time this has happened. There have been other people over the last while entirely new to the forum who come on to simply share their negative experience with a vendor. Not saying this was you. But it's happened and it peeves people off. It's like a new patron walking into a pub and openly complaining about a well loved regular to his own friends. Does that make sense? This is a cool forum. For the most part people here look out for one another. You are totally welcome to become a valuable part of it. Today you learnt a valuable lesson. :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
Look forward to seeing how your build turns out. I'm sure you'll love the finished product.

@BasWoods I hope you were able to install your enclosure by now.

On a sidenote, you are right, that note should be stated on my website, hope you understand I just realized the existence of a new batch of Spuds 29" with only the short wheelbase position, so I just updated it now. I also included a procedure to drill the holes to the deck, hope it helps you in case you still haven't drilled them yet.

All future Spud shipments will have 8 holes in the rear to alleviate this issue

@mikenyc as I understand it you got your money back, so thats a seperate issue and has no place in this thread.  

@nate when I call someone an idiot, I don't mean they have jelly for brains and cant walk a straight line, I mean they are doing something I find idiotic.  I feel like your friend is being a dick to a another member.  He didn't handle this correctly and started insulting people.  

I stand by what I said, meaning that in this instance I (thats me, not @onloop, Enertion, or even @Eboosted)  think he was being a dick.  Im happy to edit dick to be 'not nice', 'unpleasant', 'counterproductive individual' or whatever, but the sentiment is the same.

I probably should anyways, I'm not comfortable saying dick this many times :).

Money back, minus fees and a scuffed up deck that was new. It's relevant.
