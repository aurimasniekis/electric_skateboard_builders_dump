Did you buy the surf rodz RKP truck "kit" and does one kit come with one or two trucks? It reads like it would just be one complete truck in the kit, but then they ask what color you want the second baseplate and hanger. Does that mean there's two trucks in the kit? I'm confused.

* Turnigy Reaktor 250W 10A 1-6S Balance Charger
* HobbyKing 540w 220~240v Power Supply

If you spend over 50 bucks on hobbyking it’s free shipping. @Mobutusan I was told by @psychotiller that you get two of them for the price. And that’s why you can pick each hangers color and base plates color.

https://www.surf-rodz.com/products/trucks/200mm-reverse-king-pin-truck-kit-10mm 
That’s what I got, 
70mmx10mm axles, 45 degree baseplate and medium hardness barrel bushings

Thanks for the info. That makes sense. Just seems almost too cheap for a pair of precision trucks. But, no complaints here! I'm gonna order the exact same thing with 50° baseplates.

@Mobutusan yeah I agree, a great price for what they are. And it’s nice you can just get a new hanger if you bend em, or order New shoulder bolts if you need different axle lengths.

ugg dont even get me started on RAM prices lol. the NAND shortage sucks right now, hopefully it'll be over soon though. Anyways I actually bought my RAM on Newegg for $140 [16gb DDR4-3000](https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820313793) pretty good deal and better than anything at Microcenter. And I was thinking about getting the 1700 though I was already over budget with the 1600 so I stuck with that, plus I really dont need 8 cores lol.

I am trying to contain myself from buying a laptop for when I travel as well. For $730 its hard to say to to this beast:

au contraire my good friend, I think moar cores is better and that I could hold off on 16gb of Ram and bough a single 8gb stick for $60.

Yeah definitely and if I need the more cores I can always upgrade in the future, cause AM4. Also I do actually need 16GB of ram, games nowadays take a ton of RAM especially Rust and some others and I also keep a lot of programs open at the same time. I use to have 8 gigs and I was getting crashes and freezes cause of me maxing it out on occasion.

So far:

JLABS- 2 dual motor mounts, 4 BY modules, 2 single FOCBOX mounts, 2 double FOCBOX mounts.

1 Roarrockit vacuum bag kit (I want to try to use if for carbon fiber/fiberglass enclosures, we shall see)

1 Arduino Spot Welder with cables and foot pedal.

MuirSkate: 1 Jet killshot, 3 sets Caliber IIs, 3 bearing sets

Torque Boards (not yet ordered)- kegel pulley setx2, kegel pulley set x3, abec clones, 1 6355 motor.

Now comes the big one, Enertion. Ordering a little later today, I'm thinking 6 nano controllers, 6 or 7 FOCBOXEs, and 2 sets of the 97mm RSPECs.


I told my wife, "Ya, gonna buy a few parts, gotta spend money to save money" 🤣

I stood in line at the local surf shop and got 2 new Leashes for my boards. One 7' and one 8'
I also got 2 tubes of Headhunter sun screen 30spf and 2 tubes of Zikna nose coat to keep from burning my nose and under my eyes.
I only saved about $21
Oh, almost forgot, I also got to bars of sticky bumps surf wax for cool water.
