Hey folks,
I've been running this flipsky motpr for a couple months now, and as I was running motor detection the other day, j noticed it making this weird, rattling sound.

From what I can tell, it doesn't sound like a loose magnet, but I'm not so sure.
Maybe a bad bearing?

Thanks for your help in advance.

Could be. Easiest way to find out is to open the motor.

After spending 10 mins with my ear to the speaker on my laptop it does sound like a bearing or a broken magnet. (wife thinks I'm watching porn with the volume turned down).
 How does it compare with other motor when you hand spin them.  Same resistance?  Nothing binding in there?  Just be a bit careful spinning it up under power without checking because if a bearing does disintegrate in there it can cause all kinds of mischief.  As can a broken piece of magnet.  Are the motors still in warranty? Because if they are then opening them up can void said warranty.  That said as @Andy87 pointed out its the only way to know.  Check the status of the warranty and then either contact vendor/flipsky or get in there and have a dig around.

Thanks for the detailed info.
There's no additional resistance in the noisy motor, both spin freely and come to a stop at the same time. I guess I'll try contacting Flipsky before I tear anything open.
