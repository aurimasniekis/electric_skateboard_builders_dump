Yo does anybody know what is going on over at Abec11?
Flywheels are super hard to get, 107mm only in black from Evolve for €160(!) plus shipping.
They don't answer their phones.
Their page is offline.
Dafuq? Have they like given up or something?

I really hope they stay in the market. They are the pioneering brand of the downhill longboard scene.

It does seem like the longboard industry is dying now. Lots of hype and people trying to go fast and learn how to slide back in 2008-2014. The stoke was real, ive seen the whole Ontario community come and go. 

Im pretty confident that most longboard retailers arent selling nearly as much product as before.

Im not sure what is up. I literally have to fight tooth and nail to get Spuds made... took 2 months and had to call twice a week. Now same thing is happening and it's kind of pissing me off. I can actually get better communication with Chinese manufacturers.

I dont think they are going out of business.. Chris and I have had a number of really long talks and the way it seems he dosnt have enough help. I dont think its the end, just a rough patch (i really hope).

[quote="ChrisChaput, post:467, topic:27818"]
1) Imagine that you attend a trade show wearing an Abec 11 shirt and walk past a booth where someone is displaying what appear to be Flashbacks, Gumballs, and ZigZags. Then you see 83mm Flywheels, 90mm Flywheels, and 97mm Flywheels in a bunch of different colors on a Flywheel hub, and an opportunity to put "Your logo here!" A salesman from the country of origin comes out to greet you and has no idea whatsoever who you are and what an Abec 11 is. He starts to tell you what an awesome product he is selling and quotes you prices that are lower than what you can make your own wheels for, and at MOQs (minimum order quantities) less than what you can do for your own wheels. They sell to anyone and everyone at less than wholesale, as long as you have the almighty dollar.

But everybody knows that clones are bad quality.
Like you can buy cheap trucks from China, but the main brands are still out there because people know they can rely on it. I'm surprised it's not the case for Abec. Or is it just the fact that the owner is just sick of seeing his product copied ?

This isn't the problem here.  There are plenty of buyers.  The copies have nothing to do with this.  **The problem is that the skateboard wheel company does not ship skateboard wheels**, which allows folks to buy them.  I'm fed up myself.  I can't wait for some SuperFly clones to come on the market, because you can't buy real ones anyway, so what's the harm?

I have a gut feeling...that the company might have over-extended itself just a tad when they took on that contract and their move to the other part of their building. They had one heck of a rough patch when both those things occurred : moving everything to a new location and trying to fill orders from that contract at the same time. It was a huge mess.

Hopefully they get back on the right track soon.

A while back on a thread where Mr. @ChrisChaput was responding directly to us i asked him if he could do a group buy directly to the forum members. I even said that the cash would go up front as we members are used to paying first and receiving products months after. I got no response from him.

I mean what better deal could you get than receiving your cash first, in full! And only after starting the manufacturing process. I bet he would a sold a whole lot more wheels and not have to worry with delivery dates as much.

Oh no, this is not looking good. I was patiently waiting for those Abec11 107 wheels, might have to cave in and buy evolve's 107 while they are still available.
I know chris was frustrated with clones but I believe he still had plenty of buyers. No idea why he would go under considering the demand and the clamor for Abec11.

That doesn't make any sense. Anyone whose ever ridden genuine abecs vs clones will tell you theres no comparison between the two. Abecs urethane formula is what makes their wheels, not the hubs. 

Complaining about the chinese copying the hubs is pointless, doubt something so simple as wheel hubs could be patented. And I highly doubt abec designed those hubs with esk8 in mind, more like a fortunate circumstance that esk8 companies needed a wheel that they could fit a pulley through. 

I've been keeping an eye on flywheels online for the past 2 months now, and they've been sold out at major shops like daddies, nordboard, and now muirskate. So theres clearly a demand, even in the face of these chinese copies. Maybe if abec11 actually stocked product...

I ordered 97mm clones because i couldn't get the originals. Might get the evolve 107mms to compare.

They look great and feel ok... though smell a little like gasoline :slight_smile:

So they say.  If they start shipping wheels.  If wheels don't start shipping, then it's turned into a scam operation.  Wait until that happens before doing any group buys.  There is a current group buy open already that hasn't shipped yet.  Please wait until that ships then we can do another, AFTER that one ships.

They are obviously shipping to Evolve and have been shipping stuff for a long time. I don't believe you turn into scam after a while or just because you are short on money. Scammers usually go out of business pretty quick, Abec11 has probably gone thought a lot of tough times and they have never turned to scamming and probably never will. There is such a thing as reputation.

Honestly at this point I see Orangatang wheels stepping into this void.  You wait and see they will do 97mm wheels soon and maybe even larger.

ABEC really messed it up.  Im not sure why they seemed so reluctant to dealing direct and actually stocking wheels but I think the time has passed now and others have stepped up

It's a fantastic idea except it needs to be metal or it will wear out before the wheel does -- and I hope it has lots of teeth so that gear ratios can be adequately adjusted with the motor pulley size

I think insert-pulleys are better.

Like I said abec is no where they use to be ..they are only marketing for the eskate..which is OK FOR US I GUESS..but really  why redesign the wheel..and being a long boarder trick boarder for 25 years abec is far from who they were ten years ago.. time for new ppl kegel I've heard and Seismic I've heard is coming to eskate world and hopefully knock this fool out of the game ..160 bucks for wheels what a joke in my mind and all the eskate ppl jump on it no wonder prices don't drop. And he is laughing.. deep inside... I can get kegel and Seismic for 80 bucks half the price..common ppl wake up and smell the cheese

People who want the world's best wheels will pay for them.  If you don't, go buy cheaper stuff.  It's easy.  Some of us value safety more than money.  Some of us don't.

But either way you slice it, there is about to be a new player on the scene for top-end wheels besides ABEC11 and Boa Wheels.  I'm glad ABEC11 is working on new stuff as well.

But if you're looking for low price points, price is not the main thing driving these new wheel designs -- quality is.

If seimic has the world records for the fastest wheel DH longboarding at 140 k  I guess your safest abecs just don't even come close to being safe at those speeds my 97 refly wobble at 55k ..so your a eskater only I can tell ..I ride any popsicle stick that has wheels or just a plank.

I will say @Frenchy Is right about sesimic they have been in the longboard world for years.  I'm actually surprised there are not more companies jumping into the eskate world because cannibal wheels, boss hawgs, and speed vents all have cores that could have pullies put in them somehow.  I have never ridden speed vents but I do like the fact of less core and more urethane in the wheel as it would make for a smoother ride. Longboarding is not what it once was heck even 4 years ago.  A lot of stores are closing up and longboarding just isnt as popular skating will always be popular but I think eskating will be the new longboarding.

Are yours the green ones. I have the black reflys and they wobble. my 83 green abecs do not wobble and my 97 abec red clones are better balenced or its the thane is harder and doesn't warm up and warp as I ride. I can hit 60 k easy I can down hill them to  65 to 70ish. eskate is by far different and harder to handle yes hen's the motors force and weight of them. I find the wheel heat up alot faster. But I'm sure my set up is fine if anything it's a lil too stiff for my weight and how I normally ride..

That would be for the molds and maybe 500 wheels. It depends. Probably a bit cheaper.  If u want to go in on it I’m interested in a long 80mm wheel that’s 91mm diameter and center set.

A giant group mold buy would be cool. All owned by many of us. Hella cheaper in the end

It would be an issue on sizes I agree. 

80mm is just too small for the majority.  I think 97mm as a minimum, and no bright green! (tired of Bright green and orange)  That said you would sell more wheels if they were smaller diameter as the boosted lot would be interested. 

@Hummie  I could potentially be interested in investing in something, depends on potential demands.  Happy to talk via PM if its something you are seriously considering.  I could put half of that money up for a product that would work

I’ll find the details.  The cost. For me though I’d want the smaller wheel n maybe we can compromise at 92mm diameter!  Honestly the long wheel is a great smoother of the ride.  My motivation is to get a regular wheel to pair w the motors I sell and not be stuck relying on expensive abec.  A larger wheel is more work for the hub motor.  Can do a lower kv winding but still more ideal short n long for efficiency

One thing I think to make a note of is the wider the wheel on a center set wheel the more some adapters wont work like Jlabs press on adapter wouldnt fit because the core would be 2 deep into the urethane. To fix it the hub could be offest or side set.  I kind of like side set wheels.

I spoke at length to Chris and I am willing to broker a special deal for wheels if we can reach an agreement on a minimum of 300 of the same wheel (75 sets of 4) so I need a commitment on what wheel you want.  Please discuss here and settle on **ONE WHEEL** that we can accumulate at least 75 sets and I will give you a price before we purchase.  Shipping to you of course will be an additional cost.  If interest is high enough we can do additional wheels as long as your needs add up to 75 sets of the same wheel, color and compound.

I do not feel the missing man will be missing forever, however the wheel production facility is moving to Texas and even if ABEC-11 disappeared completely, the production facility will still have the core design and molds to produce wheels and they will want to use them.  Since many drive systems are engineered around the ABEC-11 core, I imagine people here want that to remain correct?  If the driving force here is to make a community wheel company than that can be done also bu it will take much more time, effort and coordination among all of you that are interested.

I feel it would just take money.  Surely a core very similar can be designed and would work with the same pulley. Or maybe that shape isn’t ideal anyway as carveon adds shrink wrap to the interface.  The Kegel core maybe better.  We could design it for the purpose we want and maybe a better core


Aend is going to Texas?

Now i can be completely wrong here but 

As I’m seeing , what’s being seen here is a group buy. In order for there to be a future ,  there requires a consistent number (a high one at that) in order for fututre iterations to run, or you just have dead stock. As I see it  This community is not large enough to keep on a consistent demand or money pool for wheels , especially ones meant to last at that. 

In summary , this is truthfully looking like a 1 run thing.

I agree it would just take money. 

Just look at the demand boa wheels created and they are the newest eskate wheel company on the market now and dominating the 100mm size. 

They didn’t even exist before their wheels and jedboard doesn’t count since they haven’t even produced an eskate yet. 

I would like to see the community wheels with kegel cores because they seem to have the easiest core design for adapter manufacturers and a 100mm size with the weight of a 90mm wheel and softness of a 107 flywheel and in grey like the hummie hubs. A little bit of everything of  which I think is best out there. 

About the carvon adapter, that is I think just a mistake of trying to please multiple abec like cores on the market instead of simply making the right shaped design for the abec 11 cores. 

I think you need to boss the market and if your make is good the market will buy it even when their only choice is to buy expensive abec 11 wheels to work with your make.

Truly innovative wheel design is not for the faint of heart or unexperienced.  The wheels everyone has been using here were not designed as powered wheels, they just happen to be working.  There are likely undiscovered deign elements of the core / wheel the could push the performance beyond the current wheels.  Unless you use a stock core from Aend or Lebada you will need to pay for mold which have a life and are priced anywhere from 5K to 30k with the part price out of the 5K mold being much higher than the 30K mold.  Every aspect of a new wheel needs to be considered, diameter, lip profile and height, width, wheel / hub aspect ratio, transition shape from the hub to the full width of the wheel (concave, convex, straight, s-curves like orangatang), compound, durometer.  In addition to the hub mold, you will need wheel molds that hold the hub when the wheel is poured around it...wheel mold are not cheap either.  Once you decide on a hub and wheel design and commit to the molds, compound and durometer there is no guarantee the wheels will be any better than what is currently available and they may be worse!  Most of the current new wheel companies are taking existing hubs and wheels (avoiding huge costs), changing the color combinations and adding great graphics with a slick marketing campaign using a standard pouring house formula.  

There is an alternative approach that we explored years ago at RipTide with a two part hub that locks the replaceable tire between them using only the axle nut.  We would need to adapt the design to eSk8 but i am sure we could work it out.  The advantage price wise is we do not need a high volume to make it work and the hubs can be used forever and all you do is replace the urethane "tire".  Depending on the complexity of the hub, a set of 8 (2/tire) could be a 1 time cost of $100 to $200 but large tires like the 107's would likely be $70.to $100 per set.  The $ are guesstimates at this point.

This has me all excited.  Great concept.  Two part core with maybe the pulley incorporated into it.
I can see this will be the way forward for a lot of aspects of esk8 in the future.  Instead of adapting to suit,  designing for purpose.

I don't agree with that statement. Maybe they're the most used in esk8, but the top used wheels in downhill, techsliding, freeriding (all disciplines see speeds equal or greater to esk8) are mostly non ABEC. The wheels I listed above are extremely popular for downhill. Also the most expensive of that list is **$64**.

We all have differing opinions, that's just part of being human. Yes we're on an esk8 forum, but we're also on a forum that prides itself on innovation and pushing boundaries. Sticking to only ABEC 11 thane where there is definitively better out there is the opposite of what we're about.

I think he DOES NOT have a point, I think he's inventing an opinion which is based on assumptions, not facts. 

Sure there are plenty if good wheels it there which are not currently in wide use in eskate platforms. Go use them, then form an opinion. But starting an opinion bassed in assumptions as fact is gonna get you called out. 

There are a couple if weeks out today that are#good as some ABEC wheels, but they are new and not as trusted. On the whole ABEC offers a range if wheels from 83mm to 107mm in different dutometers and widths that cover the gamet. Noone else does that. 

The thing that is pissing people off is throwing product slurs around with no proof, not even any anecdotery evidence. It's irresponsible and irritating.

Well that's exceptional and great, but that doesn't make ABEC the definitively better wheel. Tim met those speeds in racing slicks and pitch perfect conditions to meet that speed, aerodynamics has a larger impact over your max rolling speed versus wheels. A standup stance versus a hard tuck (in regular clothing) is the difference between 30 and 60-70 mph.

Edit: and as another excerpt on size. 2016's record was owned by Kyle Wester, who did 89.41 mph on **73mm** wheels. Double the the urethane isn't going to equate the greater performance. In fact you sacrifice a lot of handling for not a lot of supposed speed gains (again, Aero is way more important at these speeds).

[/quote]

I rate these wheels by using them and pushing them to their/my limits. That's why I'm even adding my perspective to this thread in the first place, because experience is king.

Wheels are complicated in that they have multiple attributes that affect their performance. You're quick to call into ABEC's sheer size, but what about rebound? Duro? Outer and inner lip shape? The urethane's ability to stick 'on top' or 'inside' the pavement? Did you know a wheel's core has a major impact on how a wheel wears and engages to the ground? What about a wheel's ability to slide? If it does break traction, you want it to be a smooth event and doesn't highside you. How do you achieve that desirable attribute? What about a wheels hookup characteristics? What about it's initiate characteristics? Do you know how different wheel lips can affect the traction feedback you get? There's so much design and thought that goes into wheels that is often overlooked. Experience does a lot in telling you all these things. I don't claim to be the greatest at anything, but I have tried enough to know that ABEC's offerings aren't remotely the most well designed in most of these departments.

Phat Deanz thane and Happy Thane are actually very similar. A lot of people switched to Orangatang's offerings after the Phat Deanz bit the dust.

Also, if you like Abec's Flashbacks, you'll really like the Cloud Ride Slides. They're even more buttery in the slide, but have a much more feedback for the initiate. They also don't flatspot like crazy unlike the Flashbacks.

They're not converted for esk8, but i'll put out my experience. Hold on.

Compared to AHMYO Akashas, they're nearly as grippy but have a much more smooth and controlled initiate and hookup in the slide. Akashas are VERY similar to Orangatang 83mm Kegels, except the kegels have slightly more grip and an even more aggressive hookup. The Kegels will chatter a bit against the ground, so a lot of speed is preferrable. In terms of aggressive riding, I can take all 3 wheels freestyling and pumping, so they all perform remarkably in that respect. I'll probably convert the Cloud Rides for esk8 for my next build.

For those who need more comparsions/analogues, the Cloud Rides have **more** grip versus Evolve's 83mm wheels and Jlab's thane.

I'm here because of the general lack of knowledge and disrespect that popped up today. not to mention the confusion about the focus of this forum.

And bagging on abec is fair. I don’t see anything written about them that I consider unfair.  From my research talking to the actual manufacturer abec formula is their formula anyway.  And abec charges resellers something like 65% of retail while the rest of the industry from what I’ve experienced charges 50% or even less for OEM.  Abec presents as if THEY are some Pu wizards or at least people feel that way but it’s aend.  And they’re willing to pour wheels for way less than abec sells for.  Yea I think abec deserve some questioning

And there’s always gunna be people who want different attributes. With more rebound and lower duro u lose durability for example

So that's the funny thing, as I said, my slide wheels have **more grip** than a majority of wheels already used in esk8. However their thane makes it so that they handle way better in the event the board kicks out. I found ABEC's flywheels to be more abrupt (and more dangerous) in the event they lose traction. 

Wheels that are good for sliding =/= no traction

To me, the wheels I brought up excel in both grip and no grip situations, which is what I think is being overlooked. Even if we don't want to bring those up, all the race wheels I brought up from earlier are more than adequate for esk8.

@psychotiller - yourself, Brad and some other people who seem to know Chris or more about his current situation have some insider knowledge that the wider community don't.

I respect his past accomplishments but how I see it now, as a newcomer, the wheels seem prohibitively expensive - disregarding competition. He's also AWOL and the other manufacturers appear to be regularly communicating and engaging us.

I've got zero attachment to ABEC and as soon as a widely available option comes on to the market that's comparative, even similarly priced, I will bail so hard on them. The reason I haven't already is because living in the UK there's limited imported and stocked options.

If Dexter comes to the table with a couple of decent wheel at a decent price for example I'll likely not own another ABEC wheel.

This is my opinion, ignore at your wish :call_me_hand:

I think that's what's really important here. There's no fault in using different urethane that's not ABEC or even Orangatang. As I said before, our goal as a community is to find out what works and what doesn't work well. If someone asked me for advice on what wheels to get, I'm going to point him/her towards wheels that are going to best work to achieve his/her goals. Brand loyalty, none.

Also, I haven't really brought up any stats @psychotiller. The only stat I brought up was the 2016 speed record, which was a response to you posting your own stat of ABEC's speed record. After that, I've just been more or less providing the knowledge I have from experiencing using these wheels.

I have enjoyed my abec wheels I don’t slide them as I cruise and they have some nice feel to them. I do wish that the flywheels where a little less but understand that they can command a premium price when there are not really any other wheels readily available for 90mm+ that are not relatively newer to the skate/estate game and don’t have the reputation as abec does in the skate world. As there is more competition maybe Chris will lower the prices. What is the core size difference or core to thane ratio between the boa 100mm and flywheels 97mm or 107mm?

You should try Seismic Speed Vents. 85mm urethane poured in Seismic's DEFCON formula, which is very grippy and sticky. Versus say 90mm ABECs, I think the Sesmic Speed Vents are definitely a nicer and cheaper alternative.

For another comparison, 85mm Speed Vents are grippier and ride nicer than Orangatang's 85mm Caguamas.

According the the actual manufacturer you can. That’s the goal.  The formula as I said and they said it’s theirs really.   When I get the final prices maybe you’ll be interested in joining communal ownership on the molds and we can get bulk pricing.  As it’s showing now abec are a rip off.

I don’t know anything about skateboard wheels apart from what is popular in the eskate scene. 

So tell me if I’m wrong but we like eskate wheels of 90mm size and above. Some oddballs out there like 83mm or even less but they must be riding on some really smooth roads that don’t change road surface much in smoothness and obstacles. 

The wheels you mention I don’t think are in these sizes of let’s say 90mm and above since they seem to be the most popular. And of those size abec 11 supplies the largest market with the most choice in those sizes. 

Those wheels you mention may be grippier but we don’t use them in eskate. 
Let them come out with wheels in our preferred sizes and then bash abec 11 for their overpriced wheels.

Fyi
Up till now I have only bought abec 11 wheels 90mm green, 97mm green and black, 107mm black.

Wheel size does indeed play a role in how a wheel performs, there is no denying that, but we're overlooking the formula in favor of sheer diameter.

Formulas plays a huge role in how a wheel performs over rough terrain, as it can give that 'on top of the pavement' or 'in the pavement' feel. There's plenty of very sticky and soft thane out there that's not used in the esk8 community. Venom Magnums for example feel VERY planted over any road surface, and they're only 78mm.

It's like comparing an authentic 90mm ABEC versus a 97mm clone. The ABEC is going to just feel nicer and more robust, despite its smaller diameter. The same can be said about all these smaller downhill wheels versus ABEC's urethane. Now believe me when I say I love ABEC's urethane and still own a set of flashbacks and 90mm flywheels. However they just don't compare to the TOTL urethane that's out there from brands that are constantly innovating and trying to push the envelope.

The only thing you're working towards is cutting out people who have lived and breathed skateboarding long before you were born. And even if you did cut out the middle man. What will you accomplish when you're broke and you cant afford to carry the weight of a second batch of wheels. Seriously.

Abec 11 is doing good business. That’s what’s up with them. 

I bought abec 11 wheels because I went with carvon motors which only take abec core wheels and I wanted the best abec core wheels which are abec 11. 

Now I’m locked in having spent that money on abec 11 wheels and I probably won’t buy other core wheels until I wear these wheels down. 
If it weren’t for this I would have tried kegel core wheels.

Chris is not a chemist. He doesn’t design manufacture or process the stuff but the place that does all that tells me THEY do whatever I want and have quoted me much lower prices than seems right considering what abec charges  Take that as you want but I see it as an opportunity to get a better price on the same stuff

It’s not hard to base a design on past designs that have succeeded.  A kegel-like core maybe, and I like center set and slightly rounded lips.  I don’t see what Chris is bringing that can’t be gotten
You obviously are a supporter beyond what the wheels and their price warrant and you’re saying he’s owed something for his history in skating. I don’t think so. I’m not going to sit at the expensive trough knowing the real manufacturer’s offer

As a business guy he’s conflicted.  Everyone in business is.  I’m not trying to make a profit just presenting the reality that we can skip Chris.

Genuine question.  All that being said why does it seem like ABEC wheels are always restricted stock? Only available via distributors or to board manufacturers such as metroboard, Evolve and Riptide who seem to be able to get their hands on lots of wheels?

Also I always thought that ABEC 11's were the best wheel you could buy and have loads of miles on mine but then I tried the 77 Cags from Otang - their formula is much nicer and I hope they bring out a 97.... Grail wheel.  At the moment a lack of competition is anti consumer, I'm sure more players will move into this space - especially Otang.

Because Chris is working from one order to the next just like the rest of us. If they bring out a 97 it will be a great thing. I haven't once argued against that point. Hasn't happened yet though. So assuming pricing would be different from 97mm flywheels is a little questionable right? Nobody knows! They just sling shit opinions about the price different between 90s and 107's everywhere but somehow omit the differences in build or ride quality.

@Hummie I think you're way off here about Chris's role in everything. Aend may be great chemists but what do they know about longboarding?

Mr. Chaput put in the time and money to test all manner of core and wheel shapes, and types of urethane. He figured out what works and what's crap. Mostly because what he wanted wasn't available (reminds me of your hub motors). We're all benefiting from his efforts, every wheel manufacturer and rider. It's a sad mistake to belittle all he's done.

And yes, more competition is good, more excellent wheels is good, cheaper is good. There's room for more players for sure. But pushing ABEC11 out of the game would be a loss to us in the long run.

I agree. Yes a chemist is needed to actually develop new urethane formulas, but it still has to be tested by an extremely experienced and disciplined rider. There were probably dozens of formulas that were made but thrown out  in favor of the ABEC formula we've come to know today. Chris has as much part in the development of that urethane as did the chemist who originally conjured it.

Every brand of urethane has a different feel because it was designed and test ridden by different types of riders with different types of riding styles.

I’m just stating the facts about what he has done.  He isn’t the chemist who designs the pu, or the manufacturer, or the processor who pours I believe so that leaves his role as tester.  If you want to believe that’s something special and he should be entitled to high priced sales forever based on that we disagree.  If u believe the actual people who do all the rest of the wheel making other than testing different shapes is the one who should be getting the praise and bucks then we’re on the same page.  There’s a lot of talk about designing as if it’s a real science.  Different folks want different stuff.  Square edges cause they look cool or rounded.  Or center set or whatever.  It’s not the hard part.  I go with the market and when such a situation where the actual manufacturer can be gone to and the middleman can be skipped and there’s no loss in doing so ...why not?!  Are we trying to pay for Chris’ retirement because he used to skate long ago?  There are a lot of people who put a lot of work into whatever they do and people don’t buy their products for what amounts to pity

@psychotiller is Chris riding electrics nowadays? This is the sure path to get more good stuff in the pipeline for us :slight_smile:

I remember when the pink reflex formula came out. Still smiling. ABEC11 has catered to us electric riders with the reflex formula 90,97 flys, and gave us the 107 fly. I'll be so sad if ABEC11 shuts its doors.

@hummie you got the relationship all wrong. ABEC11 figures out what shapes and properties they want, test, and come back with more different stuff to test. Aend would just be doing what Chris asked. By now the shapes and cores are hashed out, but it was Chris who did a lot of the hashing. You stand on the shoulders of giants.

We’re literally talking about a wheel. There’s not many options to a core and the shape of the rest.  And every shape and style sells anyway and it’s not a science looking for the perfect wheel so much as catering to different wants.  Without aend if abec did whatever shape they wanted and filled it with crap China pu then see what would happen

@Hummie I admire what you have done and what you are trying to achieve here, I really, really do!
You should know the best that there's always a struggle. This wheels of yours will cost much more than just what Aend is telling. First of all you don't have a core. Mould for that will be much more than mould for wheels. There are going to be a additional cost like shipping those to you and form you to all of us. And after all that it's going to only one wheel and no other option. 
Thanks to Mr. Chaput chemist from Aend can probably make a very similar good performing wheel but this huge shortcut can be made thanks to Abec11. I'm not saying that we need to buy only Abec11 wheels because of that but maybe it should be done in a different fashion than all this talk about Mr. Chaput and Abec11?

And I wouldn't call Abec11 a middle man. Taking this road you should reach out to original producer of urethane components because Aend just mix them and pour so they are also kind of middle man ;)

I disagree with that statement. If anything, the ABEC core can be improved upon, and the wheel shape can definitely be improved. Right now ABEC's design has hit a wall in that the wheel is is too large in diameter, causing gross chattering and deflection on the road. As a result, the wheels have to be round lipped-instead of square lipped. A round lip has less traction than a square lip, however it's the only choice ABEC has. Otherwise the feel of the wheel on the ground will just feel sloppy and gross. There are even more factors at play, but that's the gist of the first problems you come to realize. That's stuff that you don't know until you actually go out and test these wheels by pushing them to their limits.

Everything you posted is either something that is a preference or not, or a chemist challenge.  Sure I want tons of rebound and a soft wheel that won’t chunk, but the extent of designing a shape that would help those goals is minimal.  It’s the chemists that do it.  Sure you can make a rounded edges piece of poo but that doesn’t make your input valuable.  You see his testing as valuable and I see the chemists who give the options of what’s available as important and I guess that’s the sum of it.  When I buy a super fancy bike and put cool handlebars and seat on it and someone says “nice bike”. I don’t take credit for anything and say “yea it is”

This is from Seismic's site...apparently chemists can't solve real world chunking:

Seismic and 3dm wheels are poured at the world’s leading wheel factory, using the world’s finest urethane. We’ve conducted extensive lab tests that subject wheels to extreme stresses as they roll on a smooth drum simulating a uniform road. Our wheels never tear or chunk under these lab conditions.

*But chunks and tears are an ever-present risk as flexible urethane wheels roll, turn, and slide on imperfect surfaces in the real world.*

Even the best auto and bike tires can go flat if they roll over nails or glass. Likewise, even the best skateboard wheels can tear on nails, glass, gravel, pebbles, and small sharp residue on roads that otherwise seem smooth. In both cases, the damage is almost always a matter of physics and bad luck, not product defect. Probably only wheels  *made of steel*  would be 100% resistant to tears and chunks!

Seismic follows the basic protocol of the auto and bike industries. We evaluate each report on its own merit, and we sometimes replace torn wheels on a courtesy basis. But we usually don’t warranty wheels damaged by sharp surface elements without very clear evidence of product defect.

The most common causes of tearing and chunking include:

* *sliding and hard cornering at higher speeds on rough surfaces*
* *drifting onto road shoulders and rolling / sliding*  *over gravel, rocks, glass, and dirt*
* <em>kick-turning on rough surfaces, which can shred the edges of longboard wheels in a single afternoon</em>

![|300x244](https://seismicskate.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Circumferential_Tear_Hawgz-300x244.png)![|300x244](https://seismicskate.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Circumferential_Tear_Hawgz-300x244.png)

A tear that runs along a significant portion of a wheel’s circumference (see photos above) is clear evidence that damage occurred as the wheel  *rolled or slid*  over a sharp surface element.

Harder wheels, and wheels with rounded edges, don’t catch as easily on jagged surface features. Softer wheels, and wheels with sharper edges, are more vulnerable to damage – especially under heavier, faster, and/or more aggressive riders.

Soft urethane can even totally absorb bits of glass, jagged pebbles, and beer-can tabs. These objects can then work their way deep into a wheel and later split it open from the inside. (Think of the “Aliens” films!)

High-rebound race formulas (like Seismic Defcon™) are somewhat more vulnerable to tearing – their faster rate of energy return is only possible because they have an inherently “looser” molecular structure. But experienced racers generally agree that the added speed is worth it.

Very tall, narrow race wheels (like the Seismic 85mm Speed Vent) may be more vulnerable to tearing and chunking, for at least two reasons: 1) The longer “lever arm” between the axle and lips amplifies forces acting on the edges; and 2) Those forces are not distributed across a wide contact patch.

On very rare occasions, an air bubble trapped in a wheel lip can break open under normal riding stresses on good surfaces. Remnants of burst bubbles are fairly easy to see, and we replace such wheels. But the riding surface is definitely the culprit if more than one wheel in a set of four has torn or chunked. (It is incredibly unlikely that one set would include multiple wheels with large air bubbles on the lip.)

Plenty of hills around here in San Diego, Blacks Beach is rather popular for field testing wheels and seeing how they handle. When in doubt, you can always hit up the areas around Mt. Soledad. That or areas surrounding the rest of La Jolla.

I'm no wheel tester, I just happen to have used many of these wheels for a plethora of different disciplines to formulate my opinions and observations on the matter. I'm not alone in my observations either. If anything, there are even more experienced skaters who can tell you more about these wheels than I ever can.

Doesn't mean I don't strap a motor to these wheels, doesn't make my observations of their handling characteristics any less relevant. A wheel that handles poorly without a motor is going to handle just as poorly with a motor. And so vice versa.

[/quote]

There's a little ignorance here I think. The wheels are big because powered boards are being used as commuters, it has nothing to do with speed, downhill acumen or anything of that sort. People on powered boards want comfortable wheels that can tackle pavement cracks, unknown roads and surfaces and don't need to picked up for every small obstacle in the road. To get that you need a bigger wheel in most cases.

Rounded lips chunk less. When you're bombing around on a esk8 riding up curbs, transitioning across multiple surfaces, dragging the edge of your wheel on obstacles and all of this for hundreds and hundreds of miles - you need rounded edges. 

Stop thinking about speed, grip, traction, previous experience with small downhill wheels and all of that when considering a giant cushioned, round lipped 107mm superfly. It serves a completely different purpose.

ABEC's flywheel lips are round because it improves side-wall stability and reduces chatter whilst promoting better urethane engagement to the road. Formula has more to do with chunking rather than lip shape.

I still think we can take a lot of design queues from downhill simply because it's still the same concept. You're going fast (actually faster) over rough terrain on a piece of wood. Blacks beach for example is laden with gravel, rocks, sand, etc. that make it a challenging spot for newcomers. We make do with 'small' wheels. Not because it's some kind of "i'll make it work" mentality, but because the new urethane that's coming out is just that versatile. Diameter comes second to a formula that can better roll over the same road hazards that an esk8er/downhill skater is bound to come across.

The whole point of a wheel having a square or rounded lip is more dependent on the type of ride feel the brand wants to cater to. A square lip more easily deflects and bites into the road, giving the wheel more traction at the cost of chatter. You can ask any experienced longboarder about round versus square lips, that's their actual purpose. ABEC isn't an exception to that rule, the bigger your wheels are, the more they're going to chatter and handle inconsistently across combination terrain. You balance out that negative attribute with rounded lips. Even Orangatang admitted to running into the same problems with their 85mm Caguamas. That's why they're rounded instead of square. You can watch the video from their loaded newsletter series.

aend did the slightest rounding to what I had them make.  you wouldn't even know it wasn't square.  they said it makes a big difference.  but they explained the reason so no chunking.

I literally have zero Orangatang wheels in my inventory. But It's nice to see I'm being mistaken as a fanboy when I've been trying to be as objective as possible about wheel design.

You realize Orangatang has zero reason to not round the lips on their Caguamas, right? It's not going to save them money (actually it would probably cost them more to design that CNC operation into the mold), nor would people have questioned their Caguamas if the lips were squared.

Maybe you weren’t aware abec requires retailers to sell at a cost about 40% higher than wholesale or they cut u off.  And they sell to resellers at about 60% of that retail. No other biz I deal with charges so much to resellers.  And then when I’m dealing with the manufacturer of abec directly and them telling me THEY formulate whatever wanted and there’s no magic in abec that they don’t make, and the low prices they offer...how can one continue to be a fanboy of abec much longer despite the evidence.  Ironically it is you who are being that fanboy.

 Not analogous. Unless you’re saying they’re offering me better prices than abec. Do u have evidence for that. Unlikely the case.  Why would they?  Unless they’re sick of how abec rules the market n has trouble getting stuff out and they want more retailers for their stuff. That would make sense. I wouldn’t hold that against them. Business

Ok boys... Please... We don't need more tension. If John wants to make a wheel, great. When you don't want to embrace traditional business practices, I don't have long term hopes that things will last. But it's his right to try. I think ABEC has done extensive testing to get where they are. Now can someone come along and make something 80% as good for 1/3rd of the price? Yes, and I think they should. ABECs are like the Mercedes of wheels. They are premium wheels, and not everybody needs every bit of extra awesomeness they have. Johns wheels right now are already 80% of an abec wheel at least. Put a core in and pour that formula and you'll have a pretty good wheel, no doubt. As good as ABEC? No, but good enough for most.

What ? Chemistry or that rounded lips are less likely to chunk?  Where’s the hard part?  Maybe you’re unaware of what the manufacturers and pourers do.  They do most if not all.  You give them a model and tell what characteristics you want.   And then they tell you to make the edges a bit rounded. That’s been my experience.  If u have knowledge to share do but don’t tell me I don’t know it and it’s a mystery one day I’ll figure. Not seeing that

You're also not seeing that they are pushing you into using the molds they already have made. You think they are doing something special for you? Was it just coincidence that popocas looked like ghosts? NO! They will push you into using some generic mold they already have sitting around. They won't make you a comparable wheel to an abec 97.

Whatever. They’re not letting people use other molds. I’ve talked to 30 pourers.  They don’t do that

So 6000 for molds. And 24000 for 500 wheels?  No.  And I’m not missing anything. Generally the molds would be the overhead investment and the 500 wheels is minimum production in their terminology

Guys this discussion is going in a circle. If @Hummie is so eager to try his hand on copying abec11 quality then let him. We'll see how hard it is. I just wish all this could be expressed with less hostility towards chris and abec11. He has done a lot for this sport and is apparently dealing with some serious health issues. A man needs to make a buck so instead of complaining about the price, just get a different brand or make your own.

For now PU has the least rolling resistance. That's its only desirable trait for Esk8.  Developing an affordable high quality urethane wheel seems like a erroneous effort. Esk8 racing,  thane will soon enough become a past thought.  All the past efforts to perfect PU for performance has been done.  There is almost nothing left to get out of thane wheels. In time Pnumatics are coming, short side wall, low roll resistance, with high grip and light weight.

I’m surprised air tires aren’t better than they show.  On a bike or car they rule for efficiency and low rolling resistance.  Do people always run them with low air or something on boards because they get bad rolling resistance somehow?  Lighter by a long stretch

In my experience with wheels.... first premium wheels put about 3k on abec 97s classic back in 2016 and I thought they were the shit back then but after riding some labeda made wheels this past year for way more mileage  I generally like their handling more, kegels, Caguamas, gen 1 rspec(same as Popocas and imo almost perfect wheel for esk8 great grip and formula nice size nice rounded lips that actually don’t chunk compared to abec’s rounded lip which chunks from first day) . 

I think abec classic feels fucking great on a smaller wheel like the big zigs 75mm which I mounted on my arc thaka for awhile, they carve with a butter smooth feel while the labeda made ones just grip and grip. 

At bigger size 97 the classic formula feels really bad imo after riding more wheels they feel really dead and non responsive and borderline dangerous when shredding hard on bad pavement. tried the reflex formula for awhile and they are loads better but need more experience with it first to tell definitively 

So overall my opinion is those labeda wheels inspire much more confidence while riding on rough roads even though smaller in size because I can kick them around carve over obstacles and do all kinds of shenanigans without worrying I will wipe out (abec classic formula tends to slip all over the place imo) which is fun af but at smaller size the abec classic  formula feels awesome when carving on smoother roads not sure how to explain the feeling. Weird thing is the classic formula feels way harder at comparable Duro with even reflex or other Brand’s  

Hope to try more Brand wheels like seismic pp venom and stuff in the future cause changing it up keeps this hobby fresh, interesting and fun. 

Tldr all wheels are great in their own way just have to experiment and try different ones to see what you like and suit you nothing is perfect. No need to bash or antibash 

Oh except clone wheels. They are the best, absolute best, perfect 👌 wheels you will never find better wheels, better than anything out there 👌 , everything else is terrible, terrible, I tell you they are premium and i tell you, believe me, nothing will TRUMP them because they aren’t made in Mexico, or China, or Saudi Arabia oh wait except they are made in china. Worst wheels ever.

To be honest, I enjoy the 83mm Evolve clone wheels for sliding and lots of freeriding. Basically those wheels are **the mids to my mids** that I abuse when I don't want to waste any half decent urethane. ![image|375x500](upload://5Umsups9Iz4W7dXjAiaqDM4nryq.jpeg)

A very large step above that trash tier thane would be my S9 Butterballs:
