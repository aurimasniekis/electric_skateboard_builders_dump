I'm looking to buy nothing more than a single caliber 2 hanger (standard or esk8 length). I can't seem to find anything less than a single truck with the baseplate. Cheers y'all.

I appreciate you giving me that site to use, would you happen to know if there's a place to get it domestically in the USA?

would you happen to know if the handling would get shitty if I use the 218mm hanger in the back and a standard caliber v2 in the front?

got no idea, i run the FatBoy 230mm hangar at the back and the tb218 at the front and it feels fine. probably bc they're only 12mm different. so not so sure. would look pretty dumb tho bahahah

If anything the handling would be better with the shorter one in the front.

 @ZachTetra Just realized shipping from  Australia would be more than that. @mynamesmatt I'm still interested in the price as i may need them in the future because i shaved mine down a millimeter in order to fit boardnamics mounts but if i want to use different mounts or a great drive i would need a new hanger
