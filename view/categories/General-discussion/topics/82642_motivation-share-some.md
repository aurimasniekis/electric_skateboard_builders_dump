Just as stated above. I hope for many of u guys specially those seasoned builders to share your motivation for building esk8s or just straight designing or making things. Share here help motivate others by sharing a little bit of what u love doing and whether or not you r doing that now? And how u plan to continue doing it or plan on getting there if u havent yet? Thanks guys for taking ur time to read this and sharing what u can. Pics r encourage but not necessary lol

I always love geometric designs and doing artwork with geometry in my wood burning.

Money, friends, good schmoke. Im easily motivated, hardly moved from my current environment :joy: 

Im really moving my life into a 'hole' by  not having much to work on once I leave college(Only my second year in, but its still something to think about :man_shrugging:) , but Im hoping that a move to the west coast will be the kicker that I need to get my wheel rolling
