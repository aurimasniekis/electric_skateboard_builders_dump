Evening All

I've being trying to decide on what ESC  to get, I'm running a dual motor 10s4p set up and I can't seem to find a ESC that doesn't break the bank and is reliable. Anyone have any suggestions?  In the UK as well

Do you want to run BLDC or FOC?

If you want to stay in BLDC, the Torqueboards VESC with a loop key will work fine.

Ah okay, i'll be using BLDC as FOC VESCs seem to be very expensive. And ill look into the torqueboards VESCS, Thanks for the help

Hobbyking  VESC is good works fine in FOC on 10S. I have 2 and use them for a dual setup.
