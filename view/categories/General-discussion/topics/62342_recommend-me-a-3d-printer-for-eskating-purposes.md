I have been wanting a 3d printer since I saw one at the university almost 25 years ago.
It seems the technology is a lot more mature and affordable and the time has come to start thinking about getting one.
So what do you guys use to print gears, belt covers, wheels, enclosures etc?
I would like the printer to be able to work with nylon as this seems to be the preferred material for gears (correct me if I am wrong).
Budget is open for discussion depending on what is required to be able to print this stuff.
Finally the printer preferably must be available in the EU as otherwise I will get raped in import taxes.

A lot of peeps use cr-10, I personally brought a tevo tarantula to see if I really will use it much and honestly I haven’t used it a whole lot but I haven’t had much time either. It’s not hard to assemble like some say and I’m only 16. 

The main problem I’ve had is filament getting stuck in the tube, i think the extruded gear is too tight and making burrs on the filament. The other problem is that the bed isn’t glass meaning it doesn’t always stick well. Apart from that’s its great, not sure how well it will work with nylon though, you might have to upgrade the nozzle

I started before eSk8ing with 3d printing. I personally have a cr10S with few upgrades where I think it needs to be improved and I am 100% happy with it. I think still now after 3 years that I have it, in the same price range is a great deal. Now there is the new ender 3 from creality that has an aluminium frame (non that common for printer in the same price range), but to be honest I didn't check the review on that yet. Otherwise with a similar printing size the anycubic I3 mega is good one. For esk8 you need PLA (everyone does), ABS (you will need to make an encosure, I did it and than you cna print it fine) and PETG. he later the best material to me since share the properties of ABS and PLA. Termo resistence as ABS, but rather easier to print as PLA. Plus you can play with the fan speed to improved the layer adhesion and make pieces rock solid. On top of that it is more flexible than ABS so even if a unique pieces is able to better absorb vibration. So my advice is look for a printer that it's able to print PETG and you will be fine, since most of the esk8 parts are not goona be piece of art but functional designs. Ah yeh, being able to print nylon would also be worth it. I have seen people print Nylon with cr10 after some modification due to the high printing temperature. Personally i have never try it.

EDIT: I watched the review of the ender3. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8Z-9ncYsps
I looks really nice. Major upgrade is the 24V heated bad. To me for 200$ it's a steal.

Another prusa i3 lover here, I'm printing the parts for my mk2.5 upgrade as I write this.
If you have the money to spend, get the mk3. The removable magnetic bed alone makes getting prints out much easier. Add all the other features like sensing and correcting print missteps, filament sensor and more makes it a huge value for money (though I've heard great things about the cr-10 too).

Ok the time has come but I am in a dilemma.
Creality Ender 3 which is really cheap and from what it seems very reliable but will need upgrades to print nylon
or
Prusa i3 Mk3 which is a lot more expensive but can print nylon out of the box

What would you do?

This might not be what you want to hear, but I think it's worth investing in the i3 mk3. My experience with 3d printers in general is that you really do get what you pay for. Here's the Creative Ender 3 review:
https://www.google.co.il/amp/s/m.all3dp.com/1/creality-ender-3-3d-printer-review/
For me, the manual calibration and needed releveling are the main dealbreakers. That's extra time and hassle spent on the printer and less time on printing.
What it really comes down to is- do you want to save money now, or time later?
As you said, the mk3 (assembled) is ready to go right out of the box. Would you rather spend more time on the setup? Same goes for whenever you have to recalibrate?

I decided to get the prusa i3 mk3
I even found it in stock in Greece with the textured powder coated bed so will go and buy it today.
I will get the kit version as it is a lot cheaper.
What filaments would you suggest to start with?
I think the kit includes 1kg of PLA filament to start with, so apart from that, I will definitely need some nylon filament for wheel pulleys

Skip the nylon for now. Buy some petg and start with that. Get a bunch of prints under your belt and reevaluate nylon later. I suspect petg will be enough for a wheel pulley anyway. Nylon has a whole set of water absorption issues you won't want to deal with initially.

+1 for petg

learn the machine by just printing random stuff with the pla.  burn that whole roll before diving into the petg.

if you do get the nylon, don't unseal it before you're ready to print.

Thanks guys.
I started assembly of my new 3d printer. I got the version with the textured powder coated table :grin:.
I got a 1kg roll of petg and a 1kg roll of PA (nylon) filament.
As advised I will first start with the supplied PLA, then try PETG and finally nylon.
It will take me a few days till I finish assembly though since I can only work on the printer 1-2hrs every day :neutral_face:

I have the Mk2s Prusa and it's worked flawlessly for last 18 months since I built it (also got the kit as it's fun to build things).

Get familiar with Pla before trying other filaments otherwise you run the risk of getting frustrated early on and giving up. Pla is a piece of cake to use, but nylon can be a bit tricky... Be careful not to let it absorb atmospheric moisture otherwise it'll be unusable.

Printers I can reccomend for engineering purposes.

Prusa mk2/3
flashforge Creator Pro
Ender 4 (WIth many many upgrades)
Taz 6 with moa struder.
any laser sinter'er.

in short.  
Prusa mk2/3 is a great all round printer - great quality and relaiblity, with a decent sized bed
FFCP has a much smaller bed but what you loose in bed size, you gain back with the option of a second nozzle - dissoluble supports anyone?
Ender 4 - cheapest of the lot on its own, and is decent from the get go.  Great for manually upgrading ( I have mine with a duet wifi mainboard, and a titan aero volcano hotend.  its my best industrial machine now )
Taz 6 - just google it, youll like what oyu see,   the moar struder is just a larger nozzle which gives stronger and faster prints.
Laser sintering - strongest, best quality and technically the fastest printer, but at a heavy price tag.

He probably means Ender 3.  The Ender 4 uses similar components (hot end, extruder, controller board, roller-wheel linear motion), but is a CoreXY design, which basically means more complexity but lighter print-head (faster acceleration without inertial print artifacts).  In general, most of the criticism and praise you see about the Ender 3 also applies to the Ender 4 and the CR10 as well. 

In my experience, the Ender 3 prints very high quality out of the box, more than sufficient for mechanical parts.  For an educated user, it's easily 90% as good even without upgrades.  Quality-wise, its really only surface finish where the Mk3 does meaningfully better.  If you're printing cosplay parts or models (where surface finish is important and you're likely to sand, prime, and paint), it'll make a difference, but for us it doesnt matter.  To get the Ender 3 to the level of the Mk3, you would need to swap the hot end for an e3d v6 ($70 for the genuine hot end, $10 for a clone) and change to a direct drive extruder (this isn't actually an "upgrade," direct drive vs bowden is a design decision that comes down to precise control vs speed).

That doesnt mean the Mk3 is not a better printer than the Ender though.  The Mk3 has a lot of quality-of-life features (better power-loss recovery, magnetic PEI flex-plate, quieter operation, automatic mesh-bed-leveling etc) that make it by far the default choice in its price range.  It just comes down to how much you value things like that.  For me, power-loss has yet to ever happen in my apartment, I slapped some magnets on my Ender 3's fiberglass+buildtak bed to replicate the Mk3's, I put it in the closet to quiet it down, and I print everything at >0.24mm layer height to increase mechanical strength which means I can get away with moderate bed surface inconsistencies and almost never have to re-level my bed.

With the Ender 3 and basically all Chinese printers, I do think its very helpful to replace the extruder with an e3d Titan extruder (or the TriangleLabs clone, only the TL one is any good AFAIK) if you plan on printing PETG as I've had no luck getting the stock ones to grip the material consistently, and replace the hot-end with an e3d v6 (or a PTFE lined clone, do not bother with all metal clones, or if you do, spend an extra $15 and replace the cloned heat break with a genuine e3d one) as the Makerbot style Mk10 hot-ends are prone to "heat creep."

> He probably means Ender 3

Nop, I do indeed  mean the ender 4,  

it fixes one of the largest problems that the 3 has, which is the binding of the z axis due to misalignment.  I just find due to its H-BOT layout (not coreXY) it is more reliable than the 3 but not by much. other than that. the 3 and the 4 are pretty much identical other than the kinematic movement.

Interesting, I assumed it was corexy, havent seen a new h-bot in a while.  Out of curiosity, what speeds and accelerations do you tend to print at?

The z-axis binding is pretty easy to fix, with either a printed adjustable z-motor mount, or with a cheap replacement motor coupling.

- solid infill 80 mm/s

I would like to go higher, but at 0.2mm later with a 0.4mm nozzle I’m at almost the limit of my extruder of 10mm^3/s

Out of curiosity, would SLA printers be practical for printing esk8 parts? I’m nit familiar with resin properties as compared to the filaments widely in use for FDM 

I recently found out about the new Prusa SL1 printer for fairly cheap at least for an sla printer.

@Jmding I can get upto 70mm/s with PETG, but I wouldn't print nylon as I haven't actually tried it.
The trick is to go slow on the first layers, and on the outside.  10mm/s first layer,  30mm/s outer layers.

@Wraith SLA / DLP printers are fantastic and definitely can produce parts for the .esk8 industry,  DLP/DLPS Tends to use similar resins that might be good, but you also dont have the full choice of resins that SLA has, which definitely have options that would out perform even some metal pieces.

First I want to print some more complex models included with the printer in g-code form.
That way I will make sure everything is properly tuned and adjusted in the printer.
Then I will continue with various other stuff in PLA then start printing printer parts in petg as well as some wheel pulleys.
The nylon filament will stay sealed until I am comfortable with the printer.

Sure thing.

When you are building the machine, make sure the frame is square,  sometimes during shipping the frame is slightly warped and you just need to loosen screws and re-square the machine. otherwise your prints will end up warped.

The extruder bowden couplings can be absolute crap. so when the tube is inserted, if oyu can wiggle the tube in the housing by a couple mm, it means you need to rebuy those parts with better quality ones.  otherwise your retractions are going to end up like shit, but it can also give oozing inside the nozzle which would cause blockages.

the hotend itself is REALLY small.  there is barely any heatsink surface area for heat to dissipate, and they have 2 bolts holding the heater block to the heatsink, which obviously causes excessive heat creep. but also causes the hot end to have slower heat up times.

the nozzles are actually pretty decent, cant go wrong with what they have but I wouldn't recommend going up a size at any point as the heater-block cant cope with more than a 0.4mm nozzle


Sometimes the bearing wheels are damaged from factory,  if you push the carriages by hand and feel bumps every now and again, then youll need to replace the damaged wheels as that will cause artefacts.

the filament intake into the bowden extruder needs a printed feed helper. otherwise filament tends to get trapped against the lead screw and the extruder body, causing undue strain and wear for the motor.

the fan on the control box is controlled with the same controller that the part cooling fan is,  so if you turn your part cooling fan off, youve also turned off your main board fan which can lead to overheating and fires.

when assembling the lead screw,  sometimes due to manufacturer error, the bracket is slightly too close to the frame, and this can cause the lead screw to bind up while the z axis is moving,  this is fixed by adding a couple pieces of paper behind the bracket to push it outwards.

I recommend getting a micro sd card to sd card adaptor otherwise you'll need the print tethered to your pc which is not optimal. 

The bed it comes with is a 4 screw levelling bed.  I highly recommend removing one of the levelling screws as 4 screws causes bed warping, while 3 screws does not. (insert speech about a flat plane only needs 3 axis to be leveled and a 4th causes the bed to bend in half across the 3 axis)

I can recommend getting a 2mm thick PEI sheet and use that as your bed material. as PEI is superior to their fake buildtak adhesive plate (which you would need to cut a screw out of to remove anyway for the axis repair)

And I can recommend using 5mm jerk with 800mm acceleration values, as the stock values are quite aggressive.


EVEN with all the above mentioned,  the printer is still amazing quality and you wont be disappointed either way.

Where should I purchase one from? Amazon seems to have inflated pricing for these.

This is precisely what's needs to be done. There is a really good Facebook group, where people will answer any ender 3 related assembly or print questions that you might have. 

Since we are diyers, it's the perfect printer for us, especially if you don't have a lot of surplus funds for a printer. When configured correctly, it will give you prints like a $25,000 stratasys printer(We have one at work)

After researching, I purchased an Ender 3 pro from the Creality Direct ebay store. Very glad I did.

Where I bought: https://www.ebay.com/str/Creality-3D-Direct
Shipped in four days.

Also a sick printer, ive used the normal ender 3 (Not a massive difference other then PSU and electronics are flipped) Prints sick quality once dialed in.
