So the the hybrid sloth creatures that staff the post office have started asking me to describe exactly what is in my parcels and told me they would refuse the parcel if I didn't not tell them exactly what was in there as "nothing prohibited" would not suffice.

Ok - game on!

Next time I am telling them in a very loud voice, "it's a butt plug training kit containing various sizes of rubber butt plugs designed to stretch the sphincter, no batteries in there".

But I am going to need more go to non prohibited items to tell them.

Any ideas?

so i finally got that same guy serving me today and he made the mistake of asking what was in the package.  

"A buttplug" was the loud and proud response, the post office fell quiet and the guy serving wouldnt look at me after that. 

Team street wing 1 - post office 0

i wonder how many times he will ask before he learns the lesson....

tell them its the Turboencabulator,

heres the link and script https://youtu.be/Ac7G7xOG2Ag?t=38s

"The original machine had a base plate of prefabulated amulite, surmounted by a malleable logarithmic casing in such a way that the two main spurving bearings were in a direct line with the panametric fan. The latter consisted simply of six hydrocoptic marzlevanes, so fitted to the ambifacient lunar waneshaft that side fumbling was effectively prevented. The main winding was of the normal lotus-o-deltoid type placed in panendermic semi-boloid slots in the stator, every seventh conductor being connected by a nonreversible tremmie pipe to the differential girdlespring on the "up" end of the grammeters."
