I have a 10s4p single 6374 longboard that is really fun in straight lines but the narrow streets and heavy traffic of my city won't allow me to use it at its full potential so I want to build something more sensible

My main issue with the current board is the size and weight. It's so inconvenient to carry around. 
I don't need a speed demon. Torque and portability would be far more useful to me and I'll be using a small deck so I won't be able to go fast anyway.

So guys I have a few questions, what would you use for such board? 

Motor? Hubs / Single 6355 / Dual 5045s?

Cell? 30Q / 20S (30A discharge according to Mooch) / Basen 26650 / A123 26650? (not going to the lipo route) 

Battery config? 10s2p / 6s4p / 8s3p?

Deck? I like the jet spud but it has to be an EU vendor, I'll take alternatives under 34" preferably light and not outrageously expensive. A kicktail would be nice 

My commute is mostly going to the train station to work with some mild slope, range won't be an issue because I don't rely on the board for the whole commute.

I like the jet spud it's a good deck I'd go with that. As far as components my Raptor 1 is dual focbox dual 6355 and a 10s3p and it's only 16ish lbs.

Wouldn't dual 6355 at 10s3p out preform his current single 6374 at 10s4p?
Or be almost the same thing just on a small deck.

They one thing I like about my current board is it's light enough that I can grocery shop while carrying it around and holding a basket in the other hand.
It's only dual 5055 at 6s3p.

While I think the size would be great, the weight is kinda similar my board is clocking at 18lbs and I find that unwieldy also I don't really need this kind of power for my commute I'm a light guy at 130lbs

Wow that's exactly what I'd like to do with this build what cells and motor (brand that is) are you using?

There was a thread I was reading a day or so ago.  A smaller carbon fiber deck with build in enclosure was recently made available to us. At a good price too.... deck had pink letters.. 
Can't remember.

Do some googling for arbor mini cruisers, there's some crazy deals on at the moment if you like the look of them, I saw one for ‚Ç¨37 yesterday.

Hold your hand down by your side and measure floor to fingers, that'll give you a swinging mall grab measurement to the truck. Single 6355 and simple esc will keep weight, cost and complexity down. I'd say think less about battery configuration at the start and more about how many cells you want vs weight. Then adjust your motor to whatever kv is needed to get the range and torque from the configuration you decide on. 

Narrow trucks for maneuverability?

That's a diyeboard kit on the R1. Out of interest how many miles have you put on it? Is it reliable?

The cast trucks didn't hold up. But I'm 200 pounds and always have a pack on.
It definitely leaves me wanting more in acceleration, speed and braking but that's why I'm building a different board.
Single 6355 on a 10s2 would be just as light and probably perform better and then you can share one charger.

16lbs is pretty light with a handle, a handle makes a huge difference.

Well as far as cells goes I thought around 18 - 24 for 18650 and 10 for 26650 so around 2lbs for the pack. I want to know what config so that I know what motor kv i'll have. I want to keep the weight under 12lbs if that's possible. Probably stick with the VESC unless there's a reason not to

I'll be fine with standard trucks with a deck with a kicktail otherwise yeah might need narrow trucks

The truck thing was just an afterthought :slight_smile: I'd build 10s2p personally for acceleration and brake performance.

Have you dug through previous builds here? I'm going to join you in the mini cruiser club as soon as someone figures out how to implement endless ride on vesc.

I did, saw countless of spud builds though most of them are performance oriented and even a few Pennys but those are really stretching it. I'm mostly curious about the technical side and building the ultimate last mile commute device üòÅ

Here you go:
30", single 6368 motor, calibers and 83mm wheels.
Will be with 6s lipo but has infinite space to expand this.
Should be around 10-12lb once finished

My upcoming build, shooting for 12 lb board weight. 

Torque is limited by 1) motor max amps and 2) battery amps. 6374 has an 80A max current (allegedly), which is higher than the 2x32A for dual 5045, is less complex, and similar weight depending on what motor mounts, pulleys you use etc.

18650 cells at 20a current per cell (even with no sag) isn't ideal in 2p format. Cells in general have good Wh/kg energy density, are pretty bad by way of W/kg discharge density. So I went with 10s1p 5000Ah, 35c LiPo which hopefully should provide well in excess of the 60a my esc should handle.

Also going to try 76mm wheels which save a half a pound over 83mm wheels

 As far as cells. I'm rocking lg hg6 20650 cells. Mooch rates them as true 30a discharge cells. The capacity is claimed to be 3000mah, mooch claims closer to 2800mah. For smaller packs, these cells are better than 30q's IMO. Simply because at 2p, you still have 60a to work with. That equals no sag. I've only spent a few hrs on my mini build so far. But i still haven't had to charge that battery yet either! Pretty sweet and highly recommended. 
Im rocking a single 6355 motor. I went single drive to reduce weight and cost. Not a ton of hills where I'm at so no issues with climbing. My setup is probs right around that 12lb mark.

That's why I'm considering the Samsung 20S (30A by Mooch) probably the highest discharge of all 18650s with the downside of being low capacity a 10s2p would be capable of 60A with those cells. I'd also consider 26650 10s1p but I don't see many people using them so I'd like to see some opinion on them 

But you guys need to keep in mind the style of riding I'm going for more like a push board without the pushing (similar speeds because of the environnement) I'm fairly light so sag shouldn't be that big of an issue

Single 6355 seems the way to go, I'm also looking at 5065s which are quite cheap on banggood are they any good?

I did hence why I ask if the one from banggood is good because most 6355 can be bought from reputable brands but can you explain the difference between 6355 and 5065 in terms of performance and weight

```
You can estimate the weights based on quoted weights of the motors and motor mounts you will be using.

You wont fit 5065's unless you use TB's extra long truck, you will need to use 5045's (they dont seem to make 5055's), which have a max amperage of ~30A each.  Compared to a single 6374 which has a max amperage of 80A, dual 5045's can only produce about 80% as much torque.  With dual 5045's, you will also lose about 10% of your electrical power through resistive heating, compared to a single 6374 setup, in which you will lose about 5% of your electrical power through resistive heating.  The upside with a single 5045 however, is better traction from 2WD

Duals are almost out of question unless the weight is acceptable. Yes it's not popular to go single with a 6355/5065 but the goal is not to climb 40% grade hills or go 30mph, juste a board that I don't have to push with my feet that allows me to go to the train station faster than walking (about 20min walk from home)

Why do you think I'd recommend the 5065 if it wasn't good? I am using the exact same thing in a Lou diy hybrid and it is awesome. Climbs 20% hills even with a 10s1P

A handle makes an even bigger difference when your deck is under 31.5" long with a tail **and the handle is on the nose.**  You just kick it up and grab the nose and go.  It's so ridiculously convenient.  It sounds silly, but once you have it that way you won't ever want to NOT have it that way.

26650 10s1p
[/quote]

A123 26650 12s1p is a proven formula. 99wh for airplanes, will deliver great current, a little peace of mind from the safe(r) chemistry, good high charge cycle count. It's heavy and range isn't great though.

The most famous are boosted boards and runplayback's jet/carvon build.

12s gives close to 10s voltage. I'd consider 14s or even 15s.
