Mine just came in today and I have to say, it is much bigger and better than the old anet a8 I used to own.

I'll be willing to print stuff for you for free (pay for shipping though) if it's not too big.

Never had a Tevo before, nor have I every tried using a delta printer. So far the CR-10 has been the most bulletproof printer I've ever used (I've used a shit load), zero adhesion problems on glass if I use a glue stick and prints beautifully straight out of the box. This might be subject to change though as I spend more time with it.

Do not ever buy a Tevo this thing is giving me nightmares. Every 3 prints it will just shoot the filament out the extruder while crashing into the bed for no reason.

Keep an eye on this: https://www.gearbest.com/3d-printers-3d-printer-kits/pp_627175.html?wid=44
The price is really volatile. I copped mine when it hit $329.

If you don't mind tinkering and tuning with a printer, I'd recommend the Anet A8. Requires quite a lot of maintenance but it prints so so beautiful when you build it right. https://www.gearbest.com/3d-printers-3d-printer-kits/pp_343643.html?wid=21

I also have a CR-10 (CR-10S) if you want to print Polycarbonate you definitely need to enclose it. My polycarbonate prints warped even with good adhesion since there was a lot of air circulation. Also might want to upgrade the hotend if you want to print at higher temps or larger volume items but I managed to print with a 1.0mm nozzle with PLA fine.

I have one of these, this one has given me plenty of pain as well. I can usually print stuff but leveling bed every time is so repetitive that I die a little inside. Plus bigger prints always fuck up due to bed adhesion. As stock it can pretty much only print PLA, anything else requires some upgrades. Also used to sound a like a vacuum until I change the fans and added the motor vibration dampeners. Its a good printer for price but man 3d printing has its headaches.

I have the CR10s (it's the CR10 but with dual z axis) and it's pretty reliable. Before that I used the Anet A8. Printing PLA and flexible filament (TPU) on the CR10 is super easy but ABS is not easy... I can barely reach 90 Â°C on heatbed, I haven't tried a enclosure yet. For ABS the Tevo Tornado should be better I guess as it heats way faster and better but I wouldn't leave it printing alone overnight. I recommend the Anet A8 for complete beginners who like to tweak stuff. The Anet A8 really needs a lot of maintenance and can be a pain in the ass (I had several clogging issues). If you don't want to have stress go with the CR10, personally I had no issues yet (using it two times per week for a few months already).
Btw when I first tried Cura the print quality was quite bad. After chaning to simplify3D it was way better.

I had actually adhesion problems at the beginning. Then I used a glue stick and it worked. Later I discovered when I clean the surface with water/tissue the adhesion works without glue stick. Maybe some hydrophilic interactions?? I don't know but it really works every time. If I use isopropanol it doesn't work. Maybe you want to try that :slight_smile:

I also have a Cr-10 since 1 year and half, more or less...crazy 3D printer...I use to print a lot with it. PLA, ABS and now PETG. For PETG you do not need an enclosure as long you have a decent temperature in the room (menaing at least 20^C). My printer is in the garage so I built an enclosure for ABS which works out for PETG too. Anyhow I am really satisfied with it, I printed nice stuff. I am now printing and enclosure 76 hours to go!!!! :disappointed_relieved:

Right now I'm looking into bigger nozzles for my CR10. Im thinking at least 0.8mm, possibly with an e3D volcano add-on. This will cut my printing times for my gears to at least a third of what they originally were and I think bigger nozzles really compliment this printer. 

I also want to silence the damn thing with TMC 2208 drivers and better fans, since it's sitting in the same room as me and its incredibly annoying to hear it all the time.
