Back when I first started skating when I was a kid, some older guy brought one by the skate park once. It was a regular shaped skateboard deck, but made of aluminum. Neverr could find the company who made it.

Then a week ago, I did some research after my first cnc milled deck failed the durability test. A block of high quality aluminum big enough to cnc mill a deck out of was just over $2000 USD, so I gave up on that. I think the aluminum deck may just be unnecessary. They will cost you a fortune.

I've owned an aluminum trick deck once when I was a kid. I believe the core was hollow. Super noisy when riding, and the razer tail on the board was kind of dangerous.

I own a ThreeSix and I assure you its awesome. The board is stiff as hell and really not that heavy. The concave is deep but the width of the board makes it comfortable. The only thing that sucks is having to talk to people about it multiple times a day because its such an attention grabber.

I have a ton of miles on a billet Cindrich.  Sick deck, stiff but bombproof.  Run over by car twice .  His newer designs are rediculous, highly recommended!
