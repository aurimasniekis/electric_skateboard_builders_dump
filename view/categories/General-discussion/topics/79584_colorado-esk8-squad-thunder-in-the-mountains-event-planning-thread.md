Discuss here about your plans to get to the event and general planning. 

Let's start this disscousion so people can find other people to share ride, share hotels and what not. 

@mods feel free to move or delete the thread of it isn't in the right place l. 

I'll start it off. I want to attend but I perosonally don't think I 5 days would be fesable but I was thinking of making a trip out of it and go hiking and white water rafting. I would love to find some other people interested in doing the same. 

Thanks,
Akash

I'm definitely looking to share lodging somewhere to cut costs. I'll be arriving early morning the 12th and leaving late evening on the 16th.

yeah i think a lot of people will want to share hotels but it will be more apparent closer to the event. Im also looking to share a hotel for about 2-3 days.
