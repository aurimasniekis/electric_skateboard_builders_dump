Ran into a group of 3 riders/builders out at Jefferson Barracks Parks in the St Louis area this evening.  Unfortunately, I was low on juice and on my way home at that point.
Are you guys forum members?
Let's get a larger group ride going sometime!

South City myself.
Where are your go to ride locations?  Forest Park might be a good central location for us three if we want to try to meet up for a group ride.  Weekend forecast is just about perfect.
