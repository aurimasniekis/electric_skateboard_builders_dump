I've seen a few of them with decks I wouldn't mind repurposing.
I've never gotten a good look at their trucks I'm curious how they would behave without the casters..

they don't want to sell to us almost as much as some of us don't want to buy them :stuck_out_tongue:

I think they forgot the part where esk8 cost several hundreds to build whereas freebord cost 250... So we're more ready to pay 70 for this than freeborders...
They're just reducing their general sell
