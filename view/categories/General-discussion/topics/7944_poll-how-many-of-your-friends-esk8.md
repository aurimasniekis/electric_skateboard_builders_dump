No offence, but I seem to get why Onloop kept the polls secret for all that time :smile:

Ontopic:
While this is still a niche market, I guess most of the peeps will be cruzin solo...

You're all my friends but my real friends don't have eboards. They want to build them for $600 AUD. Pretty much impossible without cutting corners. Motor mount would have to be DIY.
