do any of you guys recharge your battery once you reach a destination.

```
Re-charging your battery when you reach your destination is a good idea, especially if your using close to half the capacity to reach that destination. And as far as the charge cycle life of the battery, ½ a full charge only counts as ½ of a charge cycle off the battery's life. So theres no harm done by frequent recharging.
What will harm lithium batteries is discharging them below 20%

If your using lipos, then its a good idea to use voltage alarm

```
If your using top quality lipos like Venom, set the alarm at 3.2
If your using economy lipos like Zippy, then set it a little higher like 3.4
In fact, I have a could Venom packs and right on the label it says minimum voltage 18 total for 6s
Venoms are pricey but there awesome packs.
I ran 2 6s 2500 25c packs in series for 12s and went 5.7 miles with speeds up to 25mph.
thats really good range for 2500 mah

You can, however you will be pulling high amps which will cause more heat in the motors and Esc's.
It would be better to put your 2 6s packs in series for 12s. You will increase power greatly while reducing current draw.
Only you will need a High Voltage Esc. Either a VESC or Torquesboard 12s Esc

Be careful with voltage alarms like those. They draw power from one cell and will eventually unbalance your lipo.
```

---
## \#18 Posted by: Namasaki Posted at: 2016-02-11T06:28:23.154Z Reads: 121

```
Use a Balance charger that designed for lipos.
Always charge in balance mode, never fast charge mode.
Always charge at 1c rate which means you match the charging current with the amp hour capacity.
5000mah - charge at 5amps
2500 mah - charge at 2.5 amps
Set the capacity limit on the charger to match the packs capacity.
Don't charge multiple packs in parallel even though you can. Its just not a good idea.
And for extra precaution, use a lipo fire safe bag. there cheap insurance.

They read all the cells individually. And I've haven't noticed a problem with them unbalancing a pack.
And I don't think I've ever seen a lipo pack discharge every cell evenly. Not even the quality packs.
with or without alarms connected.
I believe what causes this is that the pack's internal resistance varies form cell to cell
This another reason why its so important to use alarms because if just one cell falls below the mark it will sound alarm.

## \#25 Posted by: Namasaki Posted at: 2016-02-11T06:41:49.118Z Reads: 105

```
The particular voltage meter that I mentioned cycles through and reads every cell and then displays total voyage.
If any cell fall below the set point the alarm goes off.
The lipo packs discharge unevenly because of varying internal resistance which can vary a lot in cheaper packs like the zippys.
So it might seem like the meter is causing this but its not.

you can get that exact voltage meter/alarm without the pretty case for $2 I use them on all my builds.
I also have a handful of imax b6 chargers that I leave at home/work so that I can charge on the go.

That charger looks like its DC imput only. So you'll need a separate power supply to use it.
Thats why its cheap.
Better to get one with built in power supply.
I would not recommend a lipo charger that you can't set parameters like capacity limit and charging amps.
Those are 2 very important settings.
Dont skimp on the charger. Its too important. Get a good charger.
Like this one that will charge 2 packs simultaneously and only take 1 hour for 5000mah

yeah I have been using them almost daily for over a year now and I haven't seen any cell imbalance.
I think the draw is so low its not an issue.. powering lights and other things off the balance leads could cause imbalance.

I charge 2 Zippy 6s 5000mah packs at the the same time with a 5 amp charge rate no problem.
It takes about an hour to fully charge and balance both packs. When there done, there not even warm.
Thats why I never charge higher than 1c even though the packs claim a max charge rate of 5c

yeah 1C charging is plenty. that's a 6S full charge in an hour with 10A charger.

if you are that impatient that you cant wait an hour for full charge then carry a spare 6S pack in your pocket.

Can you tell me if i understand you correctly?

10Ah 6S has more range than 5Ah 12S? (Indeed it has more torque and highspeed)

 Theoretically the range should be the same. 
10ah x 22.2v = 222 watt hour/ 22.2= 10 Mile range
5ah x 44.4v=222 watt hour/22.2= 10 mile range
But current draw:
2000watts / 22.2 v = 90 amp
2000watts /44.4 v = 45 amp

That sounds that everyone should better you 12s because it has the same distance **AND** better torque?

## \#46 Posted by: lowGuido Posted at: 2016-02-11T10:49:21.304Z Reads: 79

```
no, not really. same distance, twice the price, slightly less current draw. more torque would draw more current, so thats altering the equation.
see the thing is, none of these number stay constant in the real world so you cant make any of these assumptions.
if you run higher voltage you also run lower kv motors so you end up comparing apples and oranges.

There is an 8 cell alarm with an oled screen that does unbalance you pack. The el cheapo led models don't really draw enough current to have a large impact on cell discharge.

The 8 cell monitor has been pretty well documented on the sphere.

I personally no longer use voltage alarms. When you have over 700 watt hours of capacity all you need is a total voltage display and a bms.

10s8p li-ion, I think the bms I have on my personal board cuts out at 90 amps. It is way overkill for most riding but you get almost no voltage sag. I now max my boards out with a 10s7p pack, leaves more room for electronics.

not much point going under 3.6 as there's barely any energy left and if you keep at that voltage you battery will last much longer.  
here's how much energy is available at each votage
4.00V--84%
3.96---77%
3.93---70%
3.90---63%
3.86---56%
3.83---48%
3.80---43%
3.76---35%
3.73---27%
3.70---21%
3.67---14%

the vesc seems to have two voltage cut-offs..one that drops available power a lot and then the final cut off.  I set it to 3.6 and find when I check the voltage immediately it will have sunk much lower, but then a couple hours later it will bounce to 3.6
