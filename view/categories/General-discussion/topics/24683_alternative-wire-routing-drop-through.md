Got a deal on some drop through decks with super fat radial cutouts that should fit 90/97mm wheels!

I was thinking of doing some wire channels with the dremel, but obviously the wires would need to be done differently since the center section of the deck is gone. 

I was thinking just put them short on the inside. but this would mean hubs or outboard only. clearance wise might mean no inboard motors anyways but just wondering....

@longhairedboy have you done a dt deck before? any ideas?
