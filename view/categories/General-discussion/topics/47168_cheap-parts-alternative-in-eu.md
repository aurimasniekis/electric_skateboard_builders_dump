Hi guys

I recently launched a [webshop](http://pwrboards.com) (pwrboards.com) located i Denmark. We ship all over Europe. 

We now have some new products in stock, including Belt Drive Kits, Off Road Kit, cheap FOC ESCs, Motor Protection Cases, foot bindings, Bestech BMS etc... 


In celebration you can now enjoy a big discount on our custom enclosure:

The enclosure is not great for decks with flex, due to the narrow flange, where the screw holes are located. The enclosure is great and sturdy as long as it is used on stiff decks (not dicks, but decks!) :)

Good I will think about the enclosure. I am trying to print it. If it doesn't work I will probably buy it
