I'm just posting this topic to create a general list of sellers of individual outrunner or hub motors. This should be sticky to the top. It's going to be buried in usersub. The list will adapt to what sellers have at the **current** moment. Got more suggestions.

Outrunners:
Hobbyking (SK3)
Tacon
Emax
Scorpion
Maytech

Hub motors:
http://tppsf.com/steel-hubs/, I think this is Hummies
Carvon
Maytech
Jacobs-Emf


Both: 
Alien power systems

Edit #1: list gets updated for whoever mentions others I have not heard of.

That is normal, they are phase wires. Just connect them to the 3 phase wires from your ESC and if it spins the wrong way switch any two of the wires. The order of phase wires does not matter.
