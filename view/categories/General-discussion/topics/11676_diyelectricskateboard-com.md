Works fine. Are you sure it isn't an issue on your side?

You should scan your computer. This usually means you have a virus.

Your computer is infected with malware
There's a free software to fix that.

I've seen something like that once or twice. Definitely follow what everyone else has said, but if it comes up with nothing try using a different DNS service. I think there's a DNS server out there that has a bad entry for diy

I've had the same issue, of you block the chat window it works fine.  The issue presents in Chrome only (not IE or Firefox) so I think it might be a plugin or Chrome itself showing an incompatibility with the chat window at DIY.

Had that similar issue, whatever your solution ends up being you should know that DIY is a trusted store. Issue is how you are getting to it. That said @torqueboards should take a look at this as not an isolated incident (though I have never seen the page in screengrab above, looks worse lol)

Yeah, I should have clearer.  This is not an issue of trust or even a question of legitimacy...just an issue with chrome and a website plugin.  Dexter is very cool, helpful even.

There was actually a huge ddos attack on half of the Internets DNS, so you may have visited the website during the hack. It's mostly fixed now, but your computer still could be infected with malware

Try using 8.8.8.8 as your primary dns and 8.8.4.4 as your secondary if you have a computer/phone that needs a secondary
