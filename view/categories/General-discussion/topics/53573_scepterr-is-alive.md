To all of those who has been worried that @scepterr has been gone for the past ~week, he is still alive, well, barely.

"Cerebrospinal fluid thickening that lead to black outs and losing motor control of my left eye leading to a medically induced coma while they went in through my nose popped a hole and drained fluid and then blind folded for a week"

What happened??

[quote="scepterr, post:169, topic:44200, full:true"]
Oh no it was not esk8 related, atleast not directly, didnâ€™t fall or anything, my back locked up, figured nothing serious, tried pads some muscle relaxers, seemed to be getting better, till I woke up and litterally couldnâ€™t move my left side, turned out had a pinched nerve, caused some swelling and was getting intermittent paralysis on the left side. Can still feel a twinge in my back but otherwise fully operational
[/quote]

Is this related? Or was something additional? Hope your good Max...

His back got fucked up one day and he took some meds, and then the meds fucked him up even more.

Don't take my word though, he said he'll jump on the forum in a bit.
