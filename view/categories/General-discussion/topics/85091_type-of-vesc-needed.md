I would like to run a 12s battery config. All of the ESC I am finding either don't mention it or say 10s is the highest voltage it can handle. What type of ESC/VESC would be a good choice?

Unity/focbox/vesc 6/ Ollin. Those are the most reliable, standard 4.12 work on 12s too but not as reliably

It’s recommended 10s but every vesc based controller work till 60V.
Some more reliable, some less.
I would go with a focbox or unity or any of the vesc6 derivatives or original.
Don’t get any cheap hw 4.12 based version.

My default answer is, "The best one you can afford." Don't cheap out on your motor controller or batteries. Something based on 6.x is ideal.
