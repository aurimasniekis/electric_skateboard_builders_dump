just created subreddit [r/esk8builders](https://www.reddit.com/r/esk8builders)

it's completely empty right now but i plan to write up a wiki of sorts for new builders.  i'd also ask others to fill it with content, if possible.

please raise your hand if you'd like to be a mod or admin.

I don't think I would have time to be a mod on a subreddit as demanding as my engineering schedule is, but I would be willing to help contribute to it. :slight_smile:

I brought this up before but i think the community needs less fragmentation and more unity. We're already a small crowd as it is and having multiple forums, chat servers, and social media for the same thing dilutes an already small community.

What purpose does this new subreddit serve? 
How does the community benefit? 
What can it achieve that cannot already be achieved here?

i'm with you 100%.  if this new sub gains any traction, i suppose it can used as a vehicle to funnel people to here or sk8.club, perhaps?

it was a counter to /r/electricskateboard because they're mostly prebuilts and seem to be allergic to diy.

reddit usebase is giant, let's use it drive more interest to esk8s in general?

jason, motivation here is not to drive users away from here.  quite the opposite.  i felt esk8 presence on reddit sucks and wanted to see if an alternative sub could serve a purpose.  like i said, if anything it may have a positive impact to esk8.builders.

>reddit userbase is giant

that's true, i tried to find a community like this on reddit before i went ahead and found this one. It was actually Jason's videos on youtube that sent me here.  That being said, i think the community we have here is really great and getting some linkage between here and reddit can definitely grow us.  We should have links to this forum in the sidebar, and reference posts to here and to endless sphere to try to direct more user traffic our way, especially as the sub gets larger

Just post more diy stuff on Reddit! and encourage others to do so. I'm trying to prettify the sub as much as i can, but i need users to submit more awesome content.

ooh, nice.

i see there's a bit of conflict here.

i'm going to let it stand for a bit, see what comes of it.

i doubt i'll spend much time cultivating it.

I agree with this, it seems to me that most of that subreddit is prebuilts

Yeah pal,. I'm so rich from this forum.... Lol..

& None of my competitors have ever benefited from the free exposure to the few hundred thousands of users either... Lol...

It's people like you who make me want to monitize this place.... Then you can have a legitimate Bitch.



P.s. incase you actually care, 

Building a community from the ground up, spending hours and hours writing useful content and helping people get the info they need is hard work... This forum was a ghost town for months and months... Now its self sustainable... 

Esk8.club will probably be bigger than this site... It just takes time.... and Google bots.

Eventually all the haters (you) & the other lazy arse twats who haven't contributed shite to the community except hate & more hate....  and all my competitors who sell completes will be over at the club pretending they supported it since the beginning... 

The growth rate is steady over there, just like it was here back when it was deserted...

Merry Xmas cobber

LMFAO omg jason that made my day. 

guys, this forum was started by @onloop but we own it. The balance of terror is precarious enough that as long as we do what we're doing noone will have full control or full influence from bias. YEah he could shut it down, but that's bad for the community and bad for business. Yeah he could fully commercialize this forum but that's bad for business and bad for the community. Because we could all just leave at any time and leave this whole thing he built worthless. See how that works?

@onloop is too fucking busy to manipulate you. He's hardly even around. fucking foil hats and shit man. lol

i built an entire business off his drive train then went my own way and didn't thank him for that. You see him here bitching? No, instead he fucking asked me to help him start this community and then asked me to help him mail some batteries. 

It takes all of us. ALL OF US. He knows that, i know that, you all should fucking know that by now too. 

fucking twats. hahaha i love that word.
