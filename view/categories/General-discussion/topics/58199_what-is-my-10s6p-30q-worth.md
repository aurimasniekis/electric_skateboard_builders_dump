I'm considering selling it... Its one big brick probably suits best for MTB...lightly used and has a 35amp bms so could probably use a bypass or new bms if want all the potential...

Heres the backstory if anyone cares... I built it for my delivery ebike in NYC... So it doesnt get huge performance use. When I was a total newbie I was looking for a high capacity cell and everyone, rightfully so, rages about the 30q and its amp output so thats what I bought. But since then ive become more battery intelligent and bought a bunch of PFs an affordable solution especially when I dont need a high amp output pack for a basic ebike. Which after welding and assembly is working great!

So that said its been used a few times a week each week twice daily maybe. For about a month.

If you are not using it make sure to discharge it to 36v for storage

I’m curious... do you have any pictures of the build process? Depending on how well it’s done, that battery is certainly worth 500-700 USD

meh...id rather rip it apart and use it for another build... 

i feel like the benefit here for someone is its instant gratification...its here now, in the US, and ready to use especially if someone doesnt have the skills or resources to do a build and no waiting a long ass month for nkon to arrive =)
