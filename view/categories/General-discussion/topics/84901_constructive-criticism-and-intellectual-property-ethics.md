What the **fuck** is wrong with people? why so much hate/negativity? - if this place turns into a hate-filled hell hole like the electric skateboard subreddit I'm going to die a very sad man. 

**We should be celebrating new ideas.**

Personally, I think this looks really cool! It's obviously extremely unique in terms of aesthetics but isn't outside the realms of what is possible with today's technology & manufacturing processes. I would definitely be interested in riding it to see how it goes. _(pretty sure it's not actually going to be a real product though - it's more like someones major work for a university or something - either way lots of work has gone into it)_

To the designer, Mr Lim, Congrats for thinking outside the box, product design is really hard, sometimes the best designs seem really strange at first, what is important is that you have the courage & the vision to try something different! I hope you get to ride an esk8 like your design one day!

Finally, Everyone else who thinks its funny to put people down publicly, you need to look at yourself in the mirror for a while and decide why you are on this planet and think about whether you have done something nice to help the world or others lately. Maybe start by saying something nice.

I personally don’t think ive said anything wrong besides not being convinced it is something Id use. That can definitely change but looking at the picture raises questions. Aesthetically,i like the look, just not convinced it can go all that fast or that the kinks in the “smart drive” are figured out. Ive always liked how fierce the community can be. Real products that work always survive anyways

Honestly, i'm not talking about any one person.... it's just a general feeling i get reading various threads lately.

Specifically, I'm addressing the "tone" in the room/forum.... its like pack mentality & its extremely unhealthy in online community forums.... 

EXAMPLE: 
"Everyone else is saying it's shit, it must be shit, therefore i'm also going to say it's shit too & if anyone asks me why i think it's shit i'm going to tell them that everyone says it's shit so that's why!"

Now when others see this NEGATIVE theme developing, and say for instance they don't have the courage to develop & express their own opinion, especially if they have a different opinion, it means new ideas can die prematurely. Which is extremely bad for our community.

So, is like the feeding frenzy @onloop describes. Nothing short of that. :roll_eyes:

You could lead by example. I've seen you make hostile, vague legal threats out in the open towards other vendors.

I'm pretty amused that you think you're boxing in the same weight category here by dropping such novel concepts as "emotional intelligence". Taking some night college classes are we?

I didn't see hate being slung around in this thread. I saw people being skeptical about Renders of a 'product' that looks like it will never see the light of day. People are just leery of vaporware. 

My point in all of this is that you are **not** the right person to champion the "be good to people" cause. It comes across as pretty insincere to any of the regulars who have seen you spiral into manic little fits again and again on here.

You and Frank are potentially the two most toxic people on this forum. That's my opinion, but I doubt I hold it alone. Prove me wrong, I would love to be wrong on this.

For the most part, people were stating there opinion on the look, the worries about the battery backpack and the doubt in implementation of a self driving technology. People have gotten excited over promises only to get disappointed... the acton quatro, jed boards and marbel come to mind. In the end, everyone can eat crow if someone does a proper review and it turns out to be a game changer.

I would say to all on the forum from Leader to Nub, criticism is my daily bread. I use to struggle with it here and in general. When I see something like the Nike board tread I tend to think its bate for the sharks and HEAVY criticism is forthcoming. Sharing Ideas and helping others I believe is the core of the forum. I can't see any innovation to be shared or help to render. This industry will continue to grow in ways some won't like but I think the CORE will survive.......... DIY or DIE 
I have nothing against the company ( i like their shoes) when affordable, I just don't see much room for one in my closet. 
The pot belly pig reference is funny, I think people can criticize things and make unkind commits on the forum (HATE) is always a hard word to use, it also can be constructive.

I don't think it's a cultural trend to worry much over.  This Forum has a lot of emotion that drives it. People are serious about this (sport, pastime, money pit) I'm sure most (like Me) could find many topics or treads to criticize and some do. But what I see most are people helping, sharing info and ideas. Walking a newbie through an issue offering endless answers to 100+ questions. The CORE will always Help and that's what keeps me coming back, I'm sure its not said enough but Thank You for creating the forum and giving us a place to Help or Criticise, sometimes criticism is the help.  
But in the end, It is in the eye of the beholder and not everyone dances to the same tune kinda shit.

It’s also been a way for you to keep a close eye on the market, your competitors, and the community. I’m sure you have all amounts of data you use to help buisness. Not to mention the ad space is invaluable.

I agree 100% - I learned so much from feedback.

The problem is some people like to offer "destructive" criticism, often this snowballs with others jumping on the bandwagon. It can get really nasty and often has no benefit to anyone.

I saw this happen at the electric skateboard sub-Reddit, now that place is a joke and people won't go there to Converse. If it continues to happen here it will be a a disappointment.

Like most Open forums this will continue and will need correction from time to time. It's just as necessary in the growth of anything and brings the need to shut that shit down. We all walk a thin line and try to stay on the Path, but have some fun doing it...... 
The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Bless it is he who in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers. And you will know my name is the lord when I lay my vengeance upon you!

Agreed, That is why I’m excited that the majority of VETS on the forum are innovators and risk takers. just in the past year I have learned so much and elevated the products we resale or make in house, diversification will drive the DIY industry. I promote Quality products, serious customer service and support only rivaled by a few. I love the ability to source products from the small guy ( I’m a small guy) and find ways to help those that help other with free test products and discounts you can’t get anywhere else. Everyone will criticize for whatever reason, it’s tolerable. We see who does what and why and try to aline or team up with those serious about the industry. We sell enertion products and are the Central Texas RA for Raptors seeing the same drive for quality and service. From a business standpoint, a forum is a tool that benefits all in the right scenario. From Us as vendors to the individual that gets guidance through a build thread or a discussion about a part he/she wants to use. Having both on a Forum has made the connection easier and help &amp; support more available.

Well what about getting flagged for one word like "nuts". Isnt that rediculous? Not being critisized? It shouldnt matter the critisism we all give or get if people dont like it might as well stop posting? This is why i rather speak to people and not type at least in america we have the freedom to say whatever we like even if people r offended and get their panties in a bunch

Okay @onloop , fair enough. We could all do with a bit more constructiveness in our conversations and debate. I can assure you that my intent was not to crawl entirely up inside your butthole on this topic, but your method of debate in this very thread involved passive aggressive wiki links and strawman style deflections.

You've chosen every word you've wrote on a public facing forum. You have often been hot-headed and overly aggressive at times to other vendors that _you_ invited here. You can't pull the victim card when people react to your words and actions. 

So, constructive criticism:

I am impressed with what you, and Enertion (all the folks there that have put in many hard hours to bring us some awesome gear), have done in the short time that this industry has even existed. Namely, you managed to counter the entire VESC situation pretty gracefully and in turn landed a large chunk of the market with the FOCBOX- and it's something you should absolutely be proud of as it's a great piece of tech. Enertion's efforts have made sure that that even more people out there _get to have fun on their boards_. That is really why we do this yeah?

The fact that you brought this forum up and helped build the foundation of this community is also to be commended. I have considerable amounts of respect for your contributions here, I don't want that to be lost in the noise. 

However, part of what you offered was an open forum for other vendors to advertise their own products & engage the community. All the name of nurturing innovation, right?

This is really where my criticism stems from. Your actions towards @torqueboards come across as petty and anti-innovation. I won't comment on what I think about the investment of resources towards patents at this level, but the end result is that you have singled out a smaller company and placed conditions upon them that you are not enforcing on any other vendors, for reasons I'm sure only you truly know the extent of. 

To me, it feels like you set the stage and then changed the rules the moment you felt threatened by legitimate competition. That doesn't align with your own words as to your intentions on what this forum would be. We **need** good competition, it absolutely spurs innovation. At this stage of tech, everything is iterative in a generational as well as derivative sense. Encourage it. 

You know what would've impressed me? Had you taken the high road and congratulated TB on their DirectDrive release announcements, and truly meant it. More high quality drive offerings is a good sign for the DIY 'industry' as a whole, why not just welcome it? In 3 years we'll be 2-3 more iterations/generations beyond and none of these designs will matter anyway. 

If you truly care about fostering a healthy DIY community, then support the industry as a whole. Genuine comradery will build good will for all.  Torqueboards is here to *help people have fun*, just like you guys are.

The reason it upset me is because I'm starting to notice a trend forming.

_Have you read/watched Lord of the flies?_

Maybe I can provide some more insight into my reaction; The main problem I see is that negativity is slowly becoming dominant in a growing number of people's commentary, especially when it's a topic about new or different ideas. This is not a beneficial immediate reaction in an environment that should be trying to nurture innovation. 

I've seen communities turn toxic & get ruined by this, I don't want it to happen here.

The reason I believe this negativity is spreading is due to the "Need to Belong" - if new users see it happening frequently, especially if senior members revert to being hostile and negative towards new ideas, these new "impressionable" users see this and adopt it as acceptable & normal behavior.

This need to belong to a group can lead to changes in behaviors, beliefs, and attitudes as people strive to conform to the standards and norms of the group. People often present themselves in a particular way in order to belong to a specific social group. 

For example, a new member of the high school football team might adopt the dress and mannerisms of the other members of the team in order to fit in with the rest of the group. Just like junior members on an esk8 forum might think its cool to offer negative or destructive criticisms to other people who are simply trying to create something new or different.

Junior members might also compare themselves to other members of the group in order to determine how well they fit in. This social comparison might also lead an individual to adopt some of the same behaviors and attitudes of the most prominent members of the group in order to gain greater acceptance. "Popular Joe thinks XYZ is shit, Maybe I'll take a strong stance on the topic so that I'll be liked too"

This is why it's so important that leaders in a rapidly growing industry have an ability to provide Constructive Criticism as they are the role models for the group. Anyone who sees themselves as a leader here should take the time to gently tap these people, who have immediate negative commentary, on the shoulder and ask them to be a tad more constructive.

There is a big difference between innovation, imitation and direct Infringement. 

You are known to be a fierce supporter of "following the rules" and "compliance"  & I do agree we shouldn't tolerate direct Infringement of laws, such as copyright and patents, or general forum rules, etc & you are one of the biggest advocates of this! Society does need some guidelines to keep it on track.

For example, Without your ongoing attacks enertion wouldn't have known about and been motivated to make changes. Without Frank trademarking VESC, Focbox wouldn't have existed. Sometimes you need to bang people on the head repeatedly to get compliance, Ideally you do it in a constructive way.

But we do you need to be consistent, no?! It seems like you are now saying you don't care about cases of Infringement related to design? Or any legal matters? 

What if a new brand popped up in the forum and started using someone else's brand names and logos? And selling the identical merchandise, Would that be acceptable? Would you actually Support that or speak out against it? - or do you just flip sides when it's suitable?

Do you think that the businesses that operate inside this community should simply be quite and not try to defend themselves when a competitor initiaties an attack or agressive marketing or smear campaign? I would hope that they would defend themselves, especially if they feel they have a legal right to? 

So here's my personal opinion, if copy cats, like Dexter who don't actually innovate or strive to bring new ideas into the industry, roll into this arena and then directly try to compete for sales directly against other business (carvon is probably on its last legs thanks to Dexters copy cap business model) , then that's a totally different ball game with different rules and they certainly should expect some healthy competition and if they infringe or fail to comply they should also expect to be banged on the head about it.

.... NOW Please just stop for one moment! Let's get back on topic; 

# Constructive Criticism for new ideas.

I am talking purely about new ideas and innovation! Remember I started this forum and invited my competitors onto the platform and allowed them to freely grow their businesses from here in the hope that it would allow new ideas to flourish. Amazingly it worked! Plenty of awesome "first ever" stuff has come from creators and members who hand out here.

Why did I do this? I did this because i am pro innovation, when people tear down new ideas it's bad for the community.

So stop being fuckwits about this, if you want to have an argument get your facts straight, leave the ego at the door, have a healthy debate with your peers, and be ready to deliver and take some constructive criticism.

And just so it's really fucking clear.

I don't really like Dexters current business model or ethics. Here's my constructive criticism.

1. Don't copy other people so closely, have some confidence in your own abilities and try to make something new and exciting.

2. This is sort of related to point 1, Have some respect for your peers if you are borrowing people's design at least try to credit them.

3. Your Brand & Business model basically got copied by diyeboard. If I where you I'd be totally pissed off! I would take this as a sign! It's a great reason to innovate and start to be different.

Thanks for your insight.

Just so we're clear, you're pro-innovation so long as it meets your own criteria as to what you deem worthy to be on the market. So long as you like a company or person and you don't view them as a threat/competition, it's fine? 

Glad to clear that up.

This is your playhouse after all. It's just good to know the rules you're playing by.

Edit: You know, it's pretty clear this isn't about upholding some virtue of innovation to you. There wouldn't be a financial dollar amount you were holding over @torqueboards as ransom to take them off the greylist that you imposed on them, simply because you don't like them. Cool.

I'm not sure that business and consumers and creators are the perfect mix, all living together under one roof.

But I do know for a fact it's better being together then forcing us apart.

I have devoted too much money and too many years to casually sit back in silence if my business is being threatened. I'm going to fight back every time.

But I'm also not a fan of seeing other people's dreams ripped into either. 

So I guess I've got double standards, as a business owner and a community member / leader it's hard not to be conflicted.

It's that you're setting double standards deliberately to benefit your own financial gain, while trying to masquerade as some pariah for innovation within the community. You can't invite other vendors here and tell them they're free to post their gear, and then go back on that on a personal whim and expect there to not be backlash. What kind of bubble do you live in?

Wouldn't repair my focboxes last year would you though.  Even when I said I'd pay shipping.  I told you what was wrong with them and instead of saying I could just snip off the canbus chips you told me you don't deal with australia because of shipping costs etc.  End of so lets not fling crap around about products and customer service because Dexter has been nothing short of stellar in that department.  As was enertion with the wonderful @CarlCollins sorting me out with 2 new buggers.  How many other branded 4.12 have you repaired?  Not from australia obviously.

I'm really sorry you feel that way... But to be honest this was a common issue, if you had asked me about how to solve it I would have told you in a heartbeat... (like I have done many time on this forum...). Don't think I've done this intentionally, I've always promoted the wealth of the community before any vendor, myself included.  

I'have done it a couple of time and shipping from Canada to Australia is around 60USD to 70USD and I wish that was a joke... I don't want to put this burden on the customer. 

And I do not do any international repair because it usually cost me more than It cost for the customer, and I even if like my customer I try to keep some money in my pocket.

All good mr wizard.  Hindsight is a wonderful thing.  Just for the future though there is absolutely no one here that repairs esc's.  I would have paid the shipping just to have them back up and working again.  Maybe I wasn't clear enough.  Peace my friend and thanks for not getting all nasty on my ass.  Actually think it was one of your threads that gave me the snipping info in the end anyway.  Not sure thats true but its a good olive branch so I'm going with it.  Friends?

The thing I had in mind for a while now is group repair for Aus and Eu guys. Where one guys can send me like a dozen of esc, and everyone saves on shipping, I think that could be a good Idea... but that is only a sketch.

This thread has shown me that I don't need to be.

I love this place now! 

We all know Jason's a douche but I'd down some beers with the guy. We all know long-haired boy is a pacifist sexy monster. Kugl3is gets to speak his mind. Dexter can egg people on, no biggie. Shots fired everywhere... Apparently nobody's taking too much offense... 

That last point is key... Maybe it's just Friday night  ... Either way I love all you people this is a fun read. Can't wait to skate with all of you one day 😎

Actually Jason and Brian are the same person in reality and sometimes the effort of maintaining an argument with themselves can be overwhelming.  Paranoid schizophrenia is not only hard to spell but also hard to keep up with.  Keep watching and one will emerge.

I do agree we shouldn’t tolerate direct Infringement of laws, such as copyright and patents, or general forum rules, etc &amp; you are one of the biggest advocates of this!
[/quote]

@onloop, the fake Superstar thread is still online, with a company advertising their fakes, even using our copyright product images... I told moderators to delete these images, since these are our images and are used without our approval to market 1:1 fakes of a poor quality. According to the suggested standards, we should exclude the fake offering company from the forum and delete the content. 
Especially if such companies are so ruthless to say that they are our supplier, suggesting you can have the same quality for cheaper. 

I would expect those things to be deleted immediately, showing fakers that we don't accept that. Innovation can only happen if innovators can profit from their innovations. We have users here openly advocating fake products.

In general I can understand Jason's wish to focus on constructive and positive feedback, rather than taking a personal pick on someone.

Absolutely, 100% support this; that company is using Trampa's photographs in their advertisement on this forum for fake product.

If an Asian vendor posts a dual 4.12 ESC in an orange, plastic box and calls it a _UNI-T_, with a link to purchase - is that okay to leave up?

It was a member who found the sungate wheels and posted the link after he found it, it wasn’t the Sungate company that started the thread, they came in after to answer questions.

Apples to oranges. 

This is someone who is blatantly using copyrighted images and trademarked branding to promote their products while leveraging from the real thing.

Believe me, I'm not one to jump in and defend Frank, but TRAMPA isn't wrong in this one. If they had not violated basic copyright and trademark laws, and it was just a clone, it would be a different story.

Using different consumable hardware on trucks isn't even on the same plane. It would have to be a complete knockoff SurfRodz truck being marketed as the real thing to be similar

When they used copyright images and a trademarked logo to advertise.

For the record I think most trademarks are silly unless you've got a brand that is blowing up fast
 Copyrights are notoriously hard to enforce in these situations.

You’re good. I bought them, and wouldn’t recommend them if you can afford the real things, but just believe it’s a DIY forum and people should know about the available options good or not.

 Kind of like how people should know about diyeboard. Closing the thread won’t let people know about possible downsides of them after a full review of people who might have bought them.

I guess my point is closing the thread won’t show potential downsides of the wheel, giving more evidence to why they should by trampa instead of sungate.

WOW! This thread is just a mix of emotions.

@ninTHIENdo there's a difference between Trampa barrels and fake Superstars. Those rims was made to pretend the real thing. Some one has to spent a lot of time designing them this way and it's not ok. Showing that here is totally ok. Those barrels are simply a spring replacement. You can't get them in different form or shape for that application. I found them being sold by a company that is selling punching molds.
So @trampa is right that this is a copy and sure if you can you shouldn't support that kind of companies but that is individual decision and asking to remove those posts is..... just Frank being Frank.

We should be thankful that we have a place where we can explore, share and innovate things.

I'm not saying a thread should be deleted. I'm saying infringing content should be deleted. If someone uses copyrighted, original images to advertise a fake product, that crosses a line and shouldn't be accepted. We requested samples and the company told us they are the original manufacturer, making the original Trampa hubs. 
If a company has such a low ethos and is proven to lie, you can be sure that they would also lie about the quality. People got blue hubs when ordering green ones... I don't want to know the composition of the rubber and chemicals used for de-moulding. 

With regards to barrels: Industry standard product, like screws or bearings. Nothing anyone here has invented. It was applied, not invented or designed for purpose. It's a different story.

To bring this back to IP and constructive criticism; consider this example, that's currently in our headlines:

* MBS plastic base plates fail on us (5+ people)
* E-TOXX builds a CNC base plate (genius)
* MBS releases Metal II base plate next month (thank you)

...and Joel's announcement stopped my order with E-TOXX, straight up.

Speaking as **creators**, we can all agree that MBS is not copying E-TOXX.  

MBS is not infringing on Jens' IP because MBS has sold metal base plates, for years.

As **customers**, we feel like MBS is 'making it right', and they are.  Joel even stated E-TOXXs are bulletproof and he sounds like a great guy.

Yet the economic impact to Jens is the same; the OEM is directly competing with our favorite indie creator.

Take my favorite indie esk8 E-TOXX, again: elastomeric dampers are not an invention; fitting them in a Trampa truck is awesome.

As **customers**, we feel a responsibility to speak out for our favorite creators, and that's awesome.  I speak up for my favorite creators out here all the time, even when they fail to find the right words, themselves.  

Yet what matters the most to customers, #1, is that **competition between businesses means the customer wins**.  When I see a customer arguing for less competition, that’s just a fanboy. 

Folks, I hate to be the one to point out the obvious, but when you see threads here titled Intellectual Property and Vendor Bashing and all this?

It means **electric-skateboard.builders is becoming **electric-_skateboard.business_.**  Kaly was born right here, reconfiguring Trampas. LaCroix was born right here, trying to make a better Kaly, which was a reconfigured Trampa. 

Now, you see Kaly passing LaCroix and manufacturing everything, without any Trampa components - as it should be, for a true global business.

All that, from Frank’s HS-11. Respect. 

A new, super-premium esk8 startup is launching right here, within BAESK8.  They will produce a hit board, my guess is within 6 months.

I've been reading  and I truly admire how they're bringing it all back to authentic, DIY esk8 culture.  Someone there will produce a tier-1 board, my guess is within 6 weeks using TB drives. 

There is no solution; this is merely evolution.

@onloop, 

Carvon stopped selling separate drives before Dexter ever started selling his. Using his own motors. And self designed hangar. And adapters. For kegels. And abecs. There is no foul here. Hes making direct drives accessible to us if we want them, and ones that you can use various wheels on.

@torqueboards has the best customer service ive experienced here. They are the peak of helpfulness. Dexter has repeatedly gone out of his way to get me what I need when I need it. At one point in my life I made a hobby out of studying intellectual property law because i wanted to make a career of it, and I study esk8 now as well. I havent seen anything dexter has done that is a blatant copy of someone elses design. There are only so many ways you can mount motors to trucks and wheels to motors, so being so nitpicky is unfair. Gear, belt, chain, direct, hub. 

I want to like you, but in order for people who like Dexter (and what he does) to like you, you need to not unfairly shit on the man. He is doing the good work of giving U.S. people quality esk8 parts from within our country. Work on your products and let him work on his. Most of us use both of yours. 🍺

After the posts regarding that issue, I've never had any posts censored or deleted or gotten shat on here. So you peoples seem to be the chief sinners about this topic. It made me question whether I should be on here or not.

There's no real way to legally protect IP in every jurisdiction, even a fairly solid company with access to resources like Trampa can do absolutely nothing about Sunway(?)

This is one of the main points the Chinese administration have been dealing with in the Trade war. Even Dyson with their I don't know $100m turnover have been powerless to persue.

Copycat is one thing but filling Coke bottles with Pepsi is wrong

Trampa take far too much shit from leaders here, the personal attacks against Frank who remains a calm source of good info despite these attacks....I don't know. Enertion did a great job of playing by the rules in that regard, Unity is a measure of that and I am looking forward to breaking one.

IP farming is a particularly ugly way of innovation.

Onewheel are doing a lot of this but actually implementing their patent, what happpens eventually is idea patenting without any intention of implementation....bu$ine$$

Suffice to say if you lodge patent you can come after your competitor for a slice after they do well, of course if they are killing you then you can't wait.

Creating a brand and trying to protect it? That is cool, Vedder did this so he could write code and let others take care of business matters. It's still Linux, you just can't call it Red Hat (vesc)Linux.

Here’s one we learned from a friend that used to be the chef at the Hollywood Standard; to create a spectacular drinking vodka, pour Costco vodka through a Zero Water pitcher (I believe they sell these filters at Target) like, 3-4 times.   

I don’t drink alcohol, however, the reaction was so positive that I am certain several people went out and bought those pitchers lol

Son you guys were drinking what we like to call water.

The zero water filter is strong enough to make vodka into water with one pass through and you guys did it 4-5 times of course it's a great drink it's literally water it has no alcohol you filtered it out. 

You can do the same with wine but wine does take a few pass throughs to get all the red out and bring it back to water.

hahahahaha I was thinking this but didnt wanna say it. we brew Mead, and a buddy of mine tried this. the specific gravity was the same as water after. But we did get kinda drunk. Maybe it was placebo, or his carbon was only string enough to pull pigment. depends on the filter. carbon 16 and carbon 32 pull different molecules

(16 and 32 number of the identifiable organic molecules filtered depending on the purity of the activated carbon)

yes and no.

pigment, taste, sugars, and organics that contribute to fermentation over time. Yes. So it effectively raises the proof by the % of molecules removed. The more pourous/surface area of carbon the more of these get pulled.  With each pass. Distilleries use both distilling and carbon filtration to attain a taste and color, and stop fermentation. 

All I was saying was it strips the character from ethanol. Ie, mead is no longer mead its mostly just water and ethanol, stripping the honey character that gave it birth.

Except that he didn’t spend it on legal fees.  He simply paid for some time with a lawyer who said to patent the heatsink, the $30k is notional.

To play devils advocate here, layers do that and you’ve probably seen some terrible IP farming in your time and extremely questionable patents which are only used to extract licensing.

The lawyer gave poor advice, given the dynamics of the market the reality is you’ll have an extremely difficult time extracting any licensing $ from this particular market, it’s not s/w

But I guess the glamour of getting a ‘patent’ won over, that wears off
