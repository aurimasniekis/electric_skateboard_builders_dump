Hello Eskater!
Next week I'll order a spotwelder (malectric) and my first project is a 10s3p battery with Samsung 30Q.
But before I start to weld and build, i have a questions about it😉

Okay:
1. Which nickel strips do I need?
How thick should they be?

Lg and thanks😂🙏

it very much depends if you use cell level fusing or not.
there will be no single nickel strip you can still spot weld and is big enough to handle the current through the serial connection.
so you anyhow will need to add more layers or use silicone wire for it.

one of the important things is to get real nickel and no mix nickel strips which start to corrode over time.

good thickness for spot welding is 0.15mm

I wanna build a battery like that one, but 10s3p and with a bms. 
Does it work like that guy made it? 🤔
I thought the end should be connected 🙄

We don’t see all pictures of that.
But it doesn’t look like his battery is finished.
Don’t forget to use fishpaper, even if you use the spacer.
Make sure your balance wires can’t rub on anything sharp etc.
