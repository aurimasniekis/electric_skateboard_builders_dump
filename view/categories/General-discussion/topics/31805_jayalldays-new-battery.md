A picture's worth a thousand words...<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/d/4/d4cb0fb0f0ace862b02fa127225b2bfc09755d76.JPG" width="375" height="500">

Here's what I see. The heatshrink is still on the battery-preventing any "tampering" as @jayallday
  was accused of.

The battery doesn't read nominal voltage when connected to a voltmeter. Hard to cheat that one too. 

Being accused of just trying to get refund when you didn't get what you ordered is almost normal these days on the forum...

Just a quick question:

Did he order a 4s battery? If not, then he didn't get what he ordered.

Simple as that.

Thanks man l appreciate it. Only trying to get my money back at this point. Before that I only wanted to get the battery I paid for. Now I have to shell out another $400 for a battery which will take another 10 days

He would have gotten his refund but instead he chose to threaten me an act like a brat before and after he got the product, I offered him multiple oppurtunities to work for a solution and go over any problems. The fact is he cut off communication with me when I was building it and complained when he got it how does that make any sense

What you have is the opportunity to fix the situation. That's what you do when you have a customer with a valid problem. I don't know anything other than the picture he showed me. Doesn't look like he tore into the battery to me.

And today we learned how e-switches work. 
95% of mosfet gated swiches leave a "residual voltage" when the switch is in off position.
At the mentioned stage you could short the 2 poles and this "fake voltage" wouldn't be able even to make a spark.
Thus if the guy has a eswitch turned off 15v can be a right value.
If the battery hasnt an eswitch then the battery is comprimised or the guy is faking the test. @psychotiller

Ideally in a civilized manner. @Jayallday if you try and be a bit more civil, i'm pretty sure most of the people in this forum always try their best to solve problems like this.

Have you tried what @fedestanco said? The battery can output a “fake” 15v when the eSwitch is in the off position.

It doesn't really seem like anyone actually wants to fix the "issue"(still don't know what it is). Can we get some of the talent around here to actually assess what us wrong and how to fix it. If half the energy used here was aimed at constructively problem shooting/solving we could accomplish so much.

I mean work out the problems. You don't have to prove anything, you could just walk away and stop responding if that's what you want to do. However, if you want to salvage your investment, work with us to find out what's wrong with your pack. Do what we suggested and measure the voltage again with the pack on to see what the actually value is. Are you complaining about a broken battery, or just shoddy craftsmanship?

Just take a breather and don't even think about Will for now. I'd say you can definitely salvage what you got and save some coin and headaches. The pack is likely not a lost cause. Try doing the things we suggested and I'm sure you'll be on your board before you know it.

So if he measured the voltage with the battery off he'd of course get no voltage, which is where the residual voltage from the eswitch explanation comes in. However if the battery were turned on it should read approx 33V for a 10s3p correct? Also if the battery were disharged would it not read lower as well? 

I'm genuinely curious here for future troubleshooting.

If the voltmeter is reading 16.##volts, that's roughly half what should be coming out. My guess is something broke. If the batteries are legit quality, it would be easier to just fix it and move on.
There is a arduino spot welder that has been reviewed by a forum member for about $100. Can easily fix this problem. Or just a little bit of soldering for a new switch if that's the faulty joint.

I've had a BMS that read 33v with the switch both in and off, it didn't read right until there was something with resistance connected and a multimeter didn't offer enough resistance.  I've had 3 eBay BMS's that read 4v with the switch off and 33-342v with the switch on. I've for 2 Bestech BMS's that read 12 to 14 with the switch off and no resistance and 33 to 42 with the switch on....so sounds like a switch problem to me.

I try to buy Hugh quality switches now, had to replace some cheap single throw eBay switches 4 times on the same board in a 2 week period. 

Not saying it's a cheap switch, just that it's more likely a plastic single throw switch would fail than a metal housing switch.

To everyone else thank you for your offer to help. I am open to ideas. The battery was NOT off when I checked the voltage (thanks Google) and still 15.5 is the voltage read out. The solder is not applied very well If compared to images online

Could you post a video with all your issues with the battery? Just as a sanity check.

@willpark16 copy and paste that in an email to PayPal or whoever the. Resit card vendor is and his case will go down the tube.

 @Jayallday if your not interested in resolving this issue then why post in the first place?

Yes he certainly can do that. I have plenty of documentation why I am not sending the battery in to Will park. If you don't trust a person to do a job would you still have them do said Job? If so would you have any confidence that it would be handled correctly?

You mean take a video showing that it doesn't register at the correct voltage?

A video of the soldering job and of you testing the main leads with the power on and readout on the meter. Always good to have extra eyes checking the work.

Well after reading up a little regarding the claim. I am doing nothing more than shipping the battery back on my own dollar. I am not going to attempt to repair and risk the claim. Thank you for your offer. This is just causing more problems for me. This kid always has to chime in  and You guys really make a person feel unwelcome. Literally I will not be back on this forum. Diy has been an awful experience for me.

To be blunt once death threats come into play, I just don't have that effort to help anyone. I would just like to say I have been a member for nearly two years now and have been working on this stuff for 3 years, I have contributed to numerous builds and helped many people here on this forum. I will continue to do so and my buisness will continue to help diy builders, I will continue to improve and evolve my products and won't let a bump in the road stop our progress I will allow paypal to handle this and if the rule in his favor he will receive a refund, if not and he approaches me in a different manner I will again offer to fix his purchase in whatever way I can. I am a very small buiness but I offer very good communication that many members can vouch for along with my services.

Dude can you tell me how to withdraw from this forum. I am sick of this. I dont have to provide a goddamn video to this forum. No one here has any stake in this other than me and the person I bought the thing from..
No one here gets the bigger picture. If the battery works /doesn't work is irrelevant. I still would not want the battery based off the fact that I don't trust him to provide a quality product. The guy is dishonest man. How I end up being the one in the wrong is beyond me. I should have bought an Evolve. Then I would not have been in this situation

It's very relevant, you can't ask for a refund for a working product because you don't like the seller.

I honestly believe you just want your money back. @willpark16 has done many battery repairs for me and he always makes sures I am pleased with the job done. He sends me a video of the work done and writes me all of the parts he fixed, etc. I recommend him 100% and so all the other people that he has serviced. Since your first post he has been willing to fix this issue with you and you are not able to do the simpliest task of checking the voltage which oh btw other members of the forum have asked to make sure the battery is fine. See? No one here is against you, but we want to make sure that the battery is fine, or maybe something got fucked during transit. But to be whining all the way and accusing people over stuff your not willing to share then that to me is sketchy. @willpark16 has given you alternatives to get to the bottom of this...its up to you. In the end, the true will shine buddy

I agree with @joeadams101, @willpark16 has helped me multiple times with my build and everything he has said has worked. I would not listen to what @Jayallday is saying as he cannot provide any valid proof that the battery is faulty. Now if you would like to solve this problem why not actually do the tests that people have told you to do or perhaps ship the battery to a respectable person on the forum so they can prove that it is either faulty or not faulty. If you will not do these tests it shows that you are trying to avoid proving the battery is legit. END OF STORY

I think @willpark16 should do a live video unboxing of the battery when he gets it back so we can all see the on/off voltage tests that are missing from this thread and what the problem was or wasn't. I need closure after this emotional rollercoaster. Lol 🎢

I really hate when this kind of claims go public even more where the buyer hasn't tried to fix issues directly, I also hate to see how much power the community gives to the seller when they made a public claim, this should have sanctions for both sides.

Jayallday with this attitude you will have issues not only building an electric skateboard but with almost every project you start in your life, learn to work things out, threat people like you want to be treated, DO NOT call names to people it will make you look childish and immature and it won't ever help in any situation it does not even makes you feel better.

## \#106 Posted by: TarzanHBK Posted at: 2017-08-30T08:38:00.400Z Reads: 129

I chime in here. @Jayallday posted pictures of the battery in an other closed thread:
https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/willpark-and-jayallday-slug-it-out/31807/13
Where you can clearly see some burn marks.
So someone simply shorted something, so the switch or bms is not working properly anymore.

I just don´t understand why he can´t calm down a bit, show some pictures and let other forum members help with this issue, he could probably solve himself.

The other thing is, if you bought something from someone and call it broken, you have to prove with pictures or something that you already got it broken.
Also if @willpark16 is willing to take it back to take care of the issue, I´m sure everyone will be happy in the end without much expenses.

We´re a lot of awesome people here - please keep it that way ;)

If @willpark16 tested before dispatch it must have got fucked up in transit,delivery company's throw parcels around! 
If he's offered to fix it then @Jayallday just send it back, you have already paid for the product and will eventually get a working battery that you ordered, I think he's been more than fair and has dealt with it in a respectable manner! 
Problem solved! 
Peace out ✌WARMAN

@Jayallday You've asked a few times how to "withdraw" from the forum, yet you are still posting. You are welcome here and you'll get plenty of help from well-meaning folks if you ask politely and stop the name-calling and making threats.

I will suspend your account as requested. Contact me if you'd like to join in again. I want to reiterate: you are welcomed here and it would be a shame to let a single bad experience with a purchase sour your perspective on a very large and supportive community.
