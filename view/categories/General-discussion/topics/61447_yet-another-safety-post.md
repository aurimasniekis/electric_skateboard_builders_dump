Today my brother and I went for a little night ride, well I had just finished my re-build of my second build and wanted to test it out. Well obviously you can guess how that went, around 50km/h I was suddenly no longer on the board. I managed to take 2 large steps and then tumble into a roll according to my brother. 

I was wearing a full face helmet so my head was safe but I had no other gear. I am now buying new gear including knee pads, armoured hoodies and maybe pants too. Look at it this way I ripped clothes worth at least $150 so why not spend that on proper gear to not rip your nice new clothes.

I was lucky and just have minor road rash and cuts but guys this is serious please get some gear

Aside from gear, knowing how to fall to the point that it is muscle memory is huge
Glad you're in one piece. Heal quick

Yep, totally agree. I have become very good at falling due to playing soccer and being rather small. When falling off my board now I usually try and run it out and then try to roll. This probably isn't the best way to fall but I find it natural and helps to spread out pressure

Depends on speed. Low-mid speeds great, high speed not so much. Hands start swinging around,  better off getting into a controlled slide.(road rash sucks so get something tough)
Ive had 4 operations on my right arm from a high speed roll. Things shattered..... 15+ years latter and that arm still isn't right.

Yeah, I'm looking at buying a kevlar reinforced hoodie with removable CE armour on the elbows, shoulders and spine.

The main reason for the roll this time was my unawareness of the crash happening, the was no wobbles or any debris on the road, it was 100% random. I was suddenly just stepping on the ground. No idea what actually happened but I won't be going that fast again until I get some new gear.

Honestly I'm not the best person to ask.
I've been doing stupid s*** and going fast wearing no gear since I was way to little.
Lost count of how many concussions and broken bones I've had. Lots of surgeries, a few bone grafts and more metal parts than Japanese cars. Chicks dig scars lol.
I'm in my 30s now and still struggle to wear a helmet...
Just getting into esk8. Trying to be better about it.

don’t EVER try to run it off, 9 times out of 10 you’ll break an ankle

i take 1 step and launch myself into a roll over my right shoulder, i can usually get back standing thanks to my momentum at the end of my roll

if you’ve got kevlar, just slide on your stomach, no steps

It's one thing to sprain an ankle and it's another to brake an ankle

What! are you some sort of a ninja?
How would launching yourself higher or lower or anyhow help things?

Why not just *not go 50km/h (31mph)* ?

35 km/h (22mph) is a very nice top-speed allowing you to enjoy esk8ing and all the joy and convenience without risking such a bad spill.

I don't know about you guys but I pucker up just the same wether it's 35-45mph or 20mph. Falling sucks regardless and it's the feeling of being out of control in general that scares me. I'll only really push 40mph if I know: 1 the road is smooth, 2 the road is clear, 3 I'm mentally prepared for unexpected obstacles. I guess because of this I get the heeby-jeebies a lot more often at lower ~20mph speeds.

I've had 20mph falls way worse than 45mph falls. To answer your question though, because it's fun and relaxing. Just gear up for it.

YESTERDAY - -

Conversation with myself ..  
"I'm just going to the park to hang.  
I rode 40 mi yesterday so the cobwebs are out. 
It's hot (95°F) so I'll just wear my helmet.  
_Well you better wear gloves too, you know how bad that hurts even if just a little spill._
Ok, ok.  Gloves too. 
_Remember that last fall on your hip?_ 
Fuck. Fine my hillbilly shorts under my shorts. You ok with that? 
_Better at least bring elbows and knees incase you decide to go on a speed run or something, but yeah. I'm ok with that._"  


3 miles down the road I hit a hidden bump so hard it flipped me forward. Took the brunt of it on my right forearm, rolled to hip /back. Thank _myself_ for the convincing of the hip pads.  Backpack (with the other pads in it) saved my back. 
Board flipped and landed upside down. (never seen that before). 

The elbow pads **_would have_** perfectly covered where I got road rash and scrapes. My only injury other than that was a quarter sized scrape on my shoulder. 
"_Told ya so. Never again talk yourself out of full pads._" 

Looking into those protective hoidies. Thanks for the tip.

If anyone wants a great deal this is the place to look especially for Aussies, free shipping over $80. I just ordered a pair of G-form elite knee pads and 100% mtb gloves for $95 AUD including shipping due to their great first buyers discount. Should be good for international buyers as well

Yeah there are a lot on eBay but I’m kind of weary of fake Kevlar. Just googling armoured hoodies brings up numerous different brands that seem to be much more reputable, yet also more expensive. I’ll have to have a look around, maybe I’ll see a motorbike gear shop in the city tomorrow

not to be a buzzkill but isnt 50km/hr at night just asking for trouble? I see your builds have taillights, what about headlights? you cant possibly see all the possible cracks/debris in your path, and especially at night you're tired and have slower reflexes anyways. Even during the day, for me at least, anything above 20km/h means my eyes are glued to the path directly in front of my to keep an eye out for bumps, dips, cracks, rocks, random debris....

I currently don’t have headlights on either builds but the street I was riding in is right next to mine and I know it very well, it’s is extremely smooth and new with no cracks dips or large stones. It is also well lit with street lights. 

Normally I would not go this fast at night but I was so pumped about my new board and how stable it felt I thought it would be hard to fall, it also keeps accelerating unlike my other builds as this one uses current control instead of duty cycle like my other board.

At least now it scared me enough to finally fork out for some gear

I'm glad you're okay and didn't break anything (bones or otherwise).

I took one bad fall in the city. Luckily, I was riding on the sidewalk, so no cars were around me. I wore a regular helmet (now I sport a full-face) and I also had wrist guards, elbow pads, and knee pads. I ride regular footed, so my left hip hurt a bit, but I minimized road rash.

No matter how short the ride, I always wear all of my gear because the one day that I don't wear them will be the day I fall and wish I had them.

Personally, I wear cheap clothing when riding during the day (gym wear) and old jeans at night. But not everyone has weather like Southern California, USA :smile:

Just a reminder, but if getting clothing with pockets for padding, or any armor, please make sure it is a good fit. A loose fit is not good at all, since in the event of a crash that shit will shift and move, thereby having the armor in the first place moot.
