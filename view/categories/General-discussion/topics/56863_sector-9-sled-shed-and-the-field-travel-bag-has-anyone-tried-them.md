I am looking at doing some traveling with my board whether by car or plane and looking for a Travel Bag. Noticed Sector 9 was having a sale on their Travel Bags and wanted to know if anyone has tried them and what their thoughts are. Thank you.

What are your board sizes ?

I'm really looking forward to buy this (for my 75 cm board) :

Skatebag is a russian brand iirc but I can"t find any mention to it in an english website.
