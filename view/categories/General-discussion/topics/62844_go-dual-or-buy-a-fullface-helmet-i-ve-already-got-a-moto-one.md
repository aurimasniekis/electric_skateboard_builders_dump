So im almost done completing my first board and i cant make up my mind on this last part, should i spend the money and go dual 6374's or buy a TSG Pass and go single 6374?  if i go dual i have a motorcycle helmet i can wear but i hear that might not be a good idea considering weight and field of view.. so what should i do? 

(i cant afford both right now, so what i end up going with is what i'll have to live with for 3-4 months)


and for reference (or whatever else) this is my motorcycle helmet that i'd be using for the for seeable future if i dont get a tsg: ![051915-AGV-AX-8-EVO-Naked-f-633x388|633x388](upload://eRNrQ6BHJQz2FaXlblHMcVmqbmq.jpg)

Go with the helmet.  You can always get another motor but you can't get another head.

maybe go dual 6355â€™s then and buy a helmet

also isnâ€™t it hot as a mofo out there? the tsg doesnâ€™t have great ventilation with the visor down maybe look at a full face mountain bike helmet itâ€™ll have a lot of breathing vents

totally agree , I had a full face BEFORE my first eboard even arrived (and I've skated ~34 years!) I saw what happened to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Pearce_(snowboarder) don't risk your ability to skate just to go faster!

I  find the "tsg pass syndrome" the most intriguing.
Any good helmet is up for the job.
If you own a motorcycle helmet use it. Unless It is a very low quality one It will be better than the tsg.
I use the same helmet i had for my electric bikes.

Its actually been really nice the past few month surprisingly. and i already have a 6374 motor so its too late to go 6355's.. the full face mountain bike helmet is something i may consider but i really like the small size of the TSG, always found dirt style helmets a bit big.

i'm really leaning towards just using my motorcycle helmet tbh.. i did some research about why its a bad idea to use a MC on a board but i mean, if my MC helmet can save me flying off my bike at 80mph+ i should be find taking a tumble off a board going 20-30 right?..

Going dual is also a safety improvement, as braking is so much better with two motors. That's the most important gain with 2 imo. Insufficient braking power could also kill you. A good helmet is a must though ðŸ¤”

If I was in your shoes, Iâ€™d probably just ride the single motor around for a bit, see how you like it and then maybe switch to a dual. If you go 15mm pulleys/belt on a single 6374 the braking and acceleration will be plenty on flat terrain (unless you weigh over 250lbs).

Motorcycle helmets are generally not recommended because the extra weight can cause damage to your neck when falling from a standing position on a board.

I wouldn't use the motorcycle helmet because once it hits the ground it has to be replaced.  And a good motorcycle helmet is >$500.  You can buy a lot of full-face MTB helmets for that kind of money.

Also they're heavy and hot.

Do you really believe that? Do you know the difference? Tsg is 930g. It's plenty of MC helmets that weight just 1 kg 
Imho It is just marketing. A good helmet is what we need.

Biggest difference is Field of view. Also bike helmets have sound deadaning and TSG pass allows outside sounds to be heard alot easier. 

Also a sub 1kg motorcycle helmet will be very very expensive. The TSG is at a good price point for a full face and it's features, but yes there are other options.

I agree. The tsg is a great helmet.
 I have seen carbon Fiber MC helmets for 100$  around 1 kg. In my opinion buying a helmet specific for esk8 is a good choice but not a must if you already own a good helmet.
The most important is the quality and no crashes. If i beat mine i will toss it inmediately no matter how It looks. Once the fibres within are broken you have no protection.

The FOV on my helmet is massive so i wouldnt need to worry about that but you're right on the sound and weight.. my helmet is 3.37lbs or 1528g and even thats supposed to be light for a MC helmet.. the biggest problem is that motorcycle helmets are huge no matter what size you get, so its awkward to use it on anything other than a motorcycle. just wish the TSG wasn't $260....

I would go dual. As it was mentioned it is also a safety matter since traction and braking is considerable improved plus the fact that if you break a belt you will be able to get home.

The TSG Pass is a great looking helmet however my experience has not been the best so far.

Since you already have a motorcycle helmet go dual.

uhhh, that's not how most helmets work, most have foam that regenerate by themselves after a few hours.

eitherway, a helmet is a helmet, one fall isn't bad enough to completely destroy a helmet and a customer like you is what most companies want someone who will buy a completely new helmet after a minor fall..

if the helmet is completely cracked and the foam is flattened completely then yeah it's trash, but that's not the kinda accidents esk8ers get into, that's mostly motorcycles at 100mph+ territory.

Its really up to you but like you said yourself a motorcycle helm is heavier with less field of vision.  TSG pass is specifically designed for downhill longboard.  While both will protect you when you do fall, TSG or other longboard \ BMX helmet will be more comfortable and arguably safer because you can see more.   I personally like the TSG because of the weight, vision and the visor.  I go over 30 regularly, having something blocking the wind is very desirable.  If you can find one, try it on, it will help you with making your decision

you don't need a Pass, it doesn't provide appreciably more protection than a normal half shell. I'm saying this as an owner of a pass: I love my helmet, it's super comfortable, and the visor keeps the wind out of my eyes but in terms of pure "not dying in a crash" safety, it doesn't actually help that much. Use the MC one for now and wait for another Pass group buy because they happen every year.

Yes, you are completely correct.

Except in the case of motorcycle helmets.  They do not work that way.  They have some magic sauce in the eggshell that transfers the force of the impact around your head to the outside of the helmet.  Resultant of this they are single-impact devices.  Even if you just accidentally drop it on the floor you have to replace it.  This was heavily drilled into us in every motorcycle class I've taken, and I can find a citation if you want.

for most helmet materials if it hasnt shown damage or collapsed its very likely still going to be very efffective.   i quoted some guy who works doing the testing on helmets and while the label will be covering their ass and will always tell you you need a new helmet (of course!)  he does say this in effect.

A group buy is when people new to the group want to sell something to a lot of people at the same time and don't know that they need to be level three members, and then @GrecoMan steps in and calls for moderator-backup and then thread is closed in 3 minutes.

```
First, I don't see this as an either/or.  You either get the helmet you want or you stick with your motorcycle helmet until you decide you want a lighter, smaller helmet.  Separately, you either get dual motors or not.  They're two separate decisions and neither should be compromised.  If you need a cheaper downhill helmet, there are open face downhill rated helmets for less than $100, or the Zero Gravity Vector is $190 (please see my helmet guide post for others).

Second, please don't believe what random people on the internet write without checking the facts.  Shudder.

The Bicycle Helmet Safety Institute argues that a motorcycle helmet is safer for speeds faster than 20 mph.  Source: `https://helmets.org/powered.htm`

As far as motorcycle helmets increasing the likelihood of neck injuries, this is true in some cases but if you crash that hard, you're also dealing with head impact and the motorcycle helmet would perform slightly better upon impact.  Source: `https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21768134`  (Unfortunately the AGV Evo 8 helmet is only DOT rated and not ECE or Snell rated, so the test velocity is only 1.4 mph faster than the downhill velocity impact for the TSG Pass.)
```

```
I wouldn't say motorcycle helmets aren't recommended.  The better impact performance would help, but the slight increase in neck injury likelihood from side/rear impacts is also true.

As for weights, the TSG pass is 2.34 lbs (1.06 kg) and MotoNate's AGV helmet is 3.37 lbs (1.53 kg).  Most heads are in the 3-6 kg range, with a medium-large helmet sized head is 4-5 kg.

```
Any helmet that has ExpandedPolyStyrene foam, including motorcycle, bicycle, and skate helmets (including the TSG Pass), need to be checked after a hard impact.  If the EPS foam is compressed, it does not "regenerate" and the ability of the helmet to reduce impact is compromised by the amount of the compression.

Many skate helmets have an ExpandedPolyPropylene foam layer that will reform to the original shape after an impact.  But any dual-certified skate helmet has an EPS layer, with or without the EPP layer.
 
Neither of these layers should be confused with the comfort liner.

As for having to replace it and cost, I've never heard anyone complain about the cost of replacing a helmet that's saved their head.  And good helmets don't have to be expensive, just check the impact ratings.

Personally I recommend dual drive since you already have a moto helmet. That's good for now and if you happen to fall and smash it wouldn't be a smashed new TSG Pass but rather a helmet you were going to replace anyways.

True, but at the same time my moto helmet is $380 plus another $80 for the shaded visor.. so it would be more expensive to replace than the tsg. im currently trying to sell some stuff i have lying around that i dont use anymore to try to get the $ to get dual and the tsg.
