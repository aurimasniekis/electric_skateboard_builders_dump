Sad to say it has happened again. Can we all agree that the time is ripe to wear a helmet every time you stand on a board?

This is truly saddening. I think we need to actually have a law that enforces wearing a helmet at all times. 

As this sport becomes more popular more accidents are going to happen and there is only one way to lessen the severity of these accidents, protective gear. Everyone please be safe and wear proper gear

That's heartbreaking, I'm really sad to read these kind of news. I can't ride my board without helmet anymore, but it might be a good idea to buy a full face

Absolutely, I have both full face and just regular, if I am going on a short casual ride I take the regular helmet if the ride is more than 5 miles. I go full face, these things are too dangerous and unpredictable to go without a helmet. Maybe I should always start wearing my pads as well. They have already saved me serious road rashes at least twice.

Sad 😔 another one bites the dust. It’s never good old or young. 

I only wear a helmet on long rides or if I intend to go faster than 10 mph. I do a very short ride daily just to have a board in the office and to cycle batteries during the week. I park at the far end of the office lot and ride like 1/4 mile to the office. I go maybe 5mph at most but never wear a helmet because I consider it a safe ride. I definitely need to change that habit.

So sad. I can't imagine what his wife and kids must be going through. My heart goes out to them. It's sobering to be reminded of how fragile we are and how quickly and easily we can disappear from this earth. I can't even step on my push boards anymore without throwing on my half helmet because of accidents like this. Most importantly, I'm trying to lead by example, so my kids know the importance of being safe every time, cause all it takes is one wrong fall.

I wear the helmet because I picture myself above telling my own self.. "YOU F"KING IDIOT LOOK AT YOU NOW" not only + if you like city riding.. it doesn't even need to be your own fault. Might as well wear protective gear and give the driver the right of way.. because 100% they probably don't know your there.. that 3 secs of waiting.. isn't worth your life.

@Mobutusan It's horrible... everyone would be so devastated. I honestly can't believe people take these risks. It's a mistake you can't come back from.

Wear the helmet so you can ride another day!

Word. Even all geared up, there is still risk. More so in the city, I'm sure. At least with a helmet, you give yourself a chance. That's what frustrates and saddens me about stories like this that turn what could have been a minor tumble into an irreversible tragedy. I too imagine having to look down on myself, but only able to see my devastated wife and kids. Can't let that happen. Helmets 4 Life. :facepunch:

This is sad condolences to his family I hope his example can encourage people to wear helmets every time and no not for a little while until you forget and get comfortable again especially with the weather getting warmer. I have been saved by helmets more than once from serious injury sometimes when you fall your head can act like the tip of a whip and just smash the ground and there's nothing you can do about it it's just momentum.

[quote="Deckoz, post:21, topic:51368"]
Ya know @squishy654 I’m sorry we argued about this previously…
[/quote]


Props for having the balls to apologize dude, but none needed, I understand the uphill battle of adult education. 

We need to continue to remind, even ourselves, to never grow complacent.

I place my remote in my helmet when not riding, in this way, I never use one without the other. I ride skateboards all the time without a helmet, and ate shit in the snake run the other day, snaked by a scooter kid no less...such is life...but eskates will kill you, they are proven to kill anyone and everyone, no matter how good you think you are, no matter how seasoned or experienced, these things will bite your ass and kill you when you let your guard down...to ride one without a helmet considering the circumstances is downright stupid now...we need to all realize this, and pass it on to our neighbors and every beginner before we lose more people, it's just a fact of life now..  Spread awareness before you lose your friends..simple as that...

Randy could have been any of us out testing something in the front yard...do you wear your helmet each time you do that? I will admit I have left it off in the past, made videos of me not wearing one, and now I will speak up each time I see someone else doing it..everyone needs to speak up if you see anyone riding an eskate without a helmet, it needs to be ingrained in our culture, an essential piece of gear, and someone needs to begin holding companies like Evolve accountable for making unstable crappy double kingpin designs which keep hurting people...

My favorite way to put it is like this: "Don't just wear your helmet, but always use what's inside it too" indicating your helmet should always be on, to remind you to think with what's inside it to prevent accidents and always remain aware of safety. 

If you push the limits, and push your luck, you're gonna have a bad time, you risk dying, it's not a joke anymore...it's not an argument...you are fucking stupid if you do not wear your helmet...and everyone needs to point and laugh at you...the time has come..if we wish to save lives, literally, we need to be serious about it and honest...this has nothing to do with how rad you look blasting down the street without one, that world is no more..now you look like an idiot...and a poor example...

If you see a video with some famous person riding and not wearing a helmet, call him out on it...if someone wants to ride your eskate, put your helmet on their head or don't let them ride it..I just let a kid ride mine the other day and looking back it was a poor idea...we are playing with fire here..these things have more power than a gokart and the electronics still fail every which way to Sunday and we have 1st time skateboarders asking for the cheapest ones...what do we think is going to happen? I saw it the day I entered the community and I've said the same thing since..

I have a blood stain outside my place from a buddy who dislocated both shoulders at the same time, speed wobbles (or whatever happened) don't give the rider a chance to tell us what happened, because most of the time the riders are dead...how about we try and stop this pattern?  I am just sick of losing good people from an already small community...we can prevent it and we should..we simply shouldn't be hearing these stories anymore and we seem to be hearing them more often..we are doing a poor job of awareness, I have slacked off myself, and I'm sorry...

I rode into the office this morning like I usually do. Felt weird strapping on a helmet, but with it, I went much faster than my usual 5mph, it was fun.

I'm sure we are all guilty of not wearing a helmet on slow rides and testing out builds because many of us are experienced, I see myself as the safe rider (chicken) who doesn't put himself at a speed that will kill him.

Personally I'll change my ways, my daughter is 3, my wife has clinical depression and my handicapped windowed mother depends on me. The way I see it is, if I die, my mom is homeless, my wife kills herself and my daughter ends up with the state.

Manufacturers are going to get sued at some point because of a complete lack of safety education surrounding their products.  Esk8 purchase should just come with a helmet, mandatory.    @longhairedboy's Danger Manual is a great start - the other manufacturers need to get the message and cover their asses quick.

If manufacturers are going to be blamed for what people do with their product. Nobody should make anything anymore. 

I hate the overdone UK safety regulations myself. But if there is one thing they done right it's the  safety boards they use with the following:

Look at the person who is responsible for your safety today:

And then there's just a mirror.

Be my guest to wear a seatbelt, implement airbags and crumplezone on your eboard. Or what point are you trying to make ? 

Edit: To make myself a little clearer. It's the regulations that are in place that provided those safety measures, not the manufacturers. And even though, your car has a seatbelt. That doesn't mean you use it. People get ticketed everyday for this. If it was really that important, your car wouldn't start without a seatbelt in place.
In the end, it's you, the user who has to take responsibility.

Whilst my thoughts go out to the family & friends, I can't help but think this was unfortunately in part, self-inflicted.

In at least one of the photos linked by the OP, the poor guy is shown in cycling gear WITH a helmet...

...given that he must have considered cycling sufficiently risky to warrant wearing a helmet, why on earth would he not wear one when on an esk8.

Again, I can only sympathise with his family, but please all of you reading this who think you are invincible, reconsider your actions. Wearing a helmet may not look 'cool', but your family, friends, employer, doctor, first responder will thank you in the event you do take a tumble.

This is how you get Regulation - big f@#$ing "R" regulation.  Push all responsibility onto the consumer, who WILL come back at you with lawsuits at first, then with laws and Regulations.  

https://academic.oup.com/epirev/article/25/1/90/718671

An ounce of prevention is better than a pound of cure, don't you think?

Regarding seatbelts - exactly.  You have been educated in their use and why you should wear them as the outcomes for those who fail to use them are generally poor.  That is a universe away from a car that has no seatbelts and the end-user has to install them.  The analogy holds - if a manufacturer ships you properly-sized helmet, pads and a product manual with your brand new eskate that intent is similar to a seatbelt (here's a safety system for the dangerous-as-f@#$ thing we just sold you).  Selling one without those safety systems in place (or even a general explanation of how to not die while using it) is an open invitation to get sued.  A rider can choose to not use the manufacturer-provided safety system - that's their choice, but the manufacturer cannot be blamed for negligence.

The biggest problem when it comes to helmets is that even though it's encouraged, and even if you inform people of the dangers of NOT wearing one, there will always be people who think they are the EXCEPTION to the rule and go without. Same crap with seatbelts.

A serious head injury can occur just from a fall. Now imagine falling off a board that's going 20MPH.

I am surrounded by motorcyclists and moped riders and they usually, at minimum, have a helmet on before even starting up their bikes. Most prefer to be fully padded up along with the helmet. They throw a fit when they see a video or ad with some idiot riding a motorcycle or moped without a helmet on.

Condolences to the family though...but this is, once again, a lesson for all of us. WEAR A HELMET AT ALL TIMES.

that's fine, exceptions are perfectly normal and always present...what we have had is debate, controversy and people wishing to not even have the hard discussions...What I propose is to make those who don't wear helmets the exception...correct..and the norm, or the majority should all be wearing them...it should be ingrained within our culture...creating an exception, verses continuing to have debate...

There will always be exceptions to everything, we cannot change that fact, but we can help create what is the norm or the accepted rule.  Let people latch onto this as a reason to display not wearing them, let it be an opportunity to be that exception and watch what happens...I've been watching long enough now to see the patterns...if you survive your 1st big crash, you will understand safety and complacency...if not, you haven't crashed yet, and let's just hope you do survive...the few who have lived to talk about it all have the same message..and they know best..

Exactly.  I don't want to see that (licensing/insurance/etc) either.  I want the market to regulate itself, but right now this is the wild west, and until manufacturers start to realize this and start to behave in the best interests of the consumer this is the path we're marching down - Regulation.  And that outcome is going to SUCK.  It really is in the best interests of mfg's to get in line and start thinking about safety first, not as an afterthought.

I should rephrase : the people that don't wear helmets but know they should, when I said they think they are the exception, I meant they think they couldn't ever get hurt. Or that they won't crash or they can bail perfectly in every given situation if something goes south.

I've seen it too many times. Even if the evidence is right in front of them, they still believe they are the exception. And you can repeat "Wear a helmet" till you're blue in the face, but these kind of people will only go their way and their way only.

People are capable of making their own decisions. Give them the information, warnings, etc but if they don't want to heed them, then they will have to deal with the consequences of their choices.

I'm saddened to see another amazing member of the community gone. I wish the best for Randy's family and loved ones.

The idea that everyone should wear a helmet all the time is a great one. The reality though, is that there will always be people that don't wear helmets. But what's really fucked up is influential companies not taking those safety procautions themselves. Personally, I almost never wear a helmet, I have 2 speed modes on my board (Metr.at), "No Helmet" and "Helmet". My "No Helmet" mode is the same, but speed is limited to around 12 mph. If you don't want to wear a helmet, then please, for your own sake, limit your speed.

Man. I think before it gets out of hand, one or all protective wear companies need to be approached, I’m finding it hard to get a deal on bulk direct.  I’m having to go around and catch bulk companies unloading quantities. I think the cities need to be approached as well. Enough support and I’m sure the increase in accidents will bring some laws about. My angle is to be proactive with it and involved. Before we end up with laws we don’t like.

And the shit happens to fast for most to know to roll or jump off. I have seen the inexperienced ride it to the point of impact. Tuck duck and roll with a helmet.

Sorry - I flagged the posts as I felt the focus was moving away from what the thread meant to me, Another lost rider and more about the Man himself not the circumstances.

This is a forum and a community and Dave wants the discussion on his thread. Namasaki has unflagged them

I am ALL for helmets - am considering wearing my full face more often now as it's the little unexpected moments that will get you.
When I started my first trade one of the first things we went through was health and safety. Part of that was viewing some rather graphic images and videos of workplace injuries. Confronting and helped to get a 17 year olds head focused.
Maybe a sticky is a good idea, before anyone can post they have to read it, watch a vid whatever so they know the risks.

His family is taking the time from this tragedy to also tell everyone to wear their helmets.

But I think the biggest issue is not the community here not wearing helmets, but the fact that the companies selling pre-builts are not bothering to show their own riders with helmets, and in a way they are encouraging the whole 'don't wear a helmet cause it isn't necessary' bit.

Majority here take helmet safety pretty seriously, especially since what happened with Derek and @runplayback's friend.

BaD guns right?  You defeated the purpose of this thread by bringing up an irrelevant topic.

Bringing up use of helmets has to happen.  Increased speeds put us into the realm of obvious danger.  You're never going to see a law that says a grown ass adult has to wear a helmet.  You even have states like Michigan which repealed helmet laws for motorcycles.  

Some of you guys have completely ruined this post.  

Bring awareness to helmet use and helmet safety.  

Don't talk about guns and forcing people to wear helmets by making more laws that take away your freedom.

You put the information out there, let people see the reprocutions from not wearing safety gear.  Then individuals get to decide the level of safety they wear while riding.

By all means, continue posting about helmets can save lives.  Even hitting a solid object (truck) @25 wearing a full face helmet still has the potential to kill you.  

I'd be dead if I wasn't wearing a helmet, and I'm a big fan of people wearing them.

[quote="akhlut, post:46, topic:51368"]
 if a manufacturer ships you properly-sized helmet, pads and a product manual with your brand new eskate that intent is similar to a seatbelt (here’s a safety system for the dangerous-as-f@#$ thing we just sold you). Selling one without those safety systems in place (or even a general explanation of how to not die while using it) is an open invitation to get sued
[/quote]

That particular suggestion is impractical. I will soon be on my 4th board, does that mean I'd have to pay for 4 helmets and pads involuntarily, that I would not be using because I have chosen to buy better ones anyway? I agree that they should include very obvious warnings though but I can't see anything else that they can do that would not be over the top.

Lol, yes because you can't remove the seatbelt and airbags to use on another car. Making you buy an entire new helmet for every eskate is completely idiotic.

I think people need to ride an eskate the way that smart motorcyclists ride - scanning ahead, looking for danger and riding defensively at all times. I ride a motorcycle and I assume every car driver doesn't see me and ride accordingly. If I see a car signaling to turn left in front of me ahead, I assume he might not see me and I slow down, ready to swerve or break in case he doesn't. After years of riding, I haven't crashed. I've had nearly daily close calls ALMOST hitting inattentive cars, but so far, so good. I've never, ever been complacent riding a motorcycle.

I think the same strategy should be applied to eskates. Never be complacent. Always be paranoid of the dangers of riding. Always consider your speed in relation to the road and obstacles around you. If your board suddenly threw you, would you hit that telephone pole or parked car dead on? Ride defensively at all times.

A helmet should be your last, final line of defense...well, because it literally is.

The way I see it, it's just like the regulation for wearing a helmet when cycling. Here in the UK there is no regulation, you choose yourself to wear a helmet or not.

You can easily reach similar speeds and faster whilst cycling, I know I used to hit 30mph on the flat regularly when I was younger, yet there's still no law that says you MUST wear a helmet whilst cycling. IMO there doesn't need to be. Educate safety and people will choose to do what they believe is correct. 

Whether they do or don't the consequence is their choice.

Couldn’t agree more that small donation from everyone would be helpful. 

My dad died when I was 21 and still in college. I worked three jobs then to pay for tuition and there was no money. I took out a loan to pay for the funeral. it was a rough 4 years after paying it back along with additional responsibilities, I dragged out my last year of college because I had to work more hours in order to make enough money to pay for my mom’s mortgage as well (she’s handicapped, can’t really work).

I will donate as soon as I get paid this Friday. Dealing with some major taxes this year so I'm pretty strapped at the moment.

I'm sincerely sorry for the family. I really hope you can find peace at some point throughout these hard times. 

I started wearing a helmet the moment I started esk8'ing. It's a must! I've been skating for 24 years and have never worn one. I'm so glad I do now. I've been hit by 2 cars, 1 truck (just 2 weeks ago), and I've broken my first 2 bones just esk8'ing in the last year. 

I really hate sharing my stupid face online but I don't care right now. Put on a helmet! We want everyone to stay here with us for as long as possible. Let's mitigate the risk a little!!! We've already lost too many. 

Here's me putting on one of the most important things in esk8 (Full face coming soon...).

Not sure if it's blaming...I think we would all like someone with that much of a young following to set a good and safe example. For those young followers who idolize him, they most likely need their parents to purchase a Boosted Board and those parents are responsible for setting an example and enforcing safety gear usage. For adults, this is a "you should know better" situation. 

Sadly, I know that these death are people who do wear helmets, but it just so happens that they weren't at these moments. Because of Randy's death, I have also changed my ways and no longer even step on the board without a helmet no matter how short/slow the ride is, of if it's just a short test on a new build.

I agree that the standard minimum safety advice for these boards should be to wear at least a skate helmet to ride them. 

It would help for anyone that views his youtube and wishes to ride an eskate that he always wears a helmet when he rides. He himself admits that he should always wear one. But I don’t agree that it is his responsibility for us to do so to promote this safety advice. 

It is our own responsibility to ride with good judgement and him wearing one every time would help to promote this for any of his viewers that wishes to eskate but I stress this again it is not his responsibility. Of course I do think if he did wear one every time it would help to promote the safety of it. 

I was also surprised to see his new employee Dan riding one without a helmet so he definitely doesn’t think about it actively one could assume. Maybe he did tell him to wear one and Dan said nah I’ll be fine without one which is a shame I think but still it is his and your own choice. 

Having said/thought this, please always wear a helmet when riding an eskate. It is always safer to wear one then not. 

One more thing. If Casey one day happens to fall and hit his head while riding an eskate, I am sure this will help the promotion of wearing a helmet. So there is a ‘win’ situation here but I sure hope it never happens to him.

Not California, But Canada. Esk8er on an Evolve CGT has died from a hit and run.

Remember to wear your safety gear, but that doesn't mean you won't get injured or killed. Hit & Run or not, he probably would've died. Be careful out there, slow it down and pay attention, because it's not always you who has the control over the terrain or traffic. Dumba$$es often seem to have the upper hand for some reason

1:15 AM and serious head injury. Hit and run is wrong but I do wonder if he was wearing a helmet which could've had a different outcome.

I used to test my boards at around 1 AM when there's no one on the road here. Thinking back, it there was a hit and run I'll probably lay there (possibly dead) for hours before anyone finds me.
