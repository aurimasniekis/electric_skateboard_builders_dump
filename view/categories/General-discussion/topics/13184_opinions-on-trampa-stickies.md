I've been looking for a softer wheel to replace the wheels that I got from Torqueboards a few months ago (claim is 76a but the 81s on my non-electric are softer...). 74a Tampa stickies look to be perfect but with shipping to US the cost skyrockets - I want to make sure these things are good before purchasing. Does anybody know how these hold up? Do they really feel like the 74a that trampa claims?

u can try to mention @trampa himself here, though would be great to hear from someone is a user already.. definately looks like they have brought something new and also perhaps high quality to the market.. too bad shipping for you to usa is high.. they should probably open a branch in usa.. to drive the shipping cost down :D

Hi, we wouldn't offer different shore hardness's, if they were all the same. 
Its all about choice, we like to offer. 
76a is already quite soft and you feel a huge difference to the 81a wheels which are quite solid. So we thought: Lets ad a 74a + the entire 90mm wheel range in all hardness's. 
A bit crazy, but no one else does it. Search the internet...
Price is reasonable if you consider that we park a lot of $$ in wheel stock, since we need to buy quite a lot of wheels per harness and size if custom made to specification and in top quality. Premium brand urethane, propper hardness accuracy etc... 
We have tons of wheels for all sorts of applications! Have a look at our pneumatic wheels and tires options. Its insane.
You pay for choice that you wouldn't get somewhere else. Choice means stock and stock means invest and storage. Nothing is for free in this world. Be glad that you found what you need and pay with a smile. Its only a little more for you but a lot of invest and risk for us.

Frank, I am absolutely willing the spend the $$ on this if it is what I am hoping for. The purpose of this thread was to see if people who purchased them think they are worth it. Do you have any videos or pictures that show how these ride, or how they hold up overtime?

The 90ties just get their print. We float them over. I'll check and give a reply.

Quality is as always Trampa! We don't do the cheap stuff. The softer, the more they wear, sure. I had some cheap orange clones which were down in no time. Frustrating...

Wear is only an issue on the driven wheel though. I recommend to buy 5 so you save on shipping. To be honest: My 76a Stickies have quite some miles on and are still good. 
Not good for sales (-;
I changed the wheels over once (left to right).
Its 20mins of work but prevents uneven wear.
If you change front to back and left to right, they will last quite long.
You won't be disappointed.

Good tip! Thanks! 
I'm also waiting patiently for these wheels. I have a nice custom build coming up and the ABEC 11 Green and Orange color scheme is not really what I'm after. I need a set of the Black 90mm as soon as humanly possible. Please!! 
You guys are really stepping it up at Trampa! Everything...Drive systems...wheels...MTB stuff as usual. All great looking stuff. Can't wait to try some out and put some mileage on those 90mm wheels. 
Trampa seems legit as they come. IMO

Hey @trampa! You have some typos on the sales pages for the 90mm wheels. FYI. On the page for the Black 90mm it says 74A, but in other spots it says 76A. Could you guys please clarify what is what? It appears to me that White is 78A, Black is 76A, and Blue is 74A. Is this correct?

im had black 83mm stickies on my vanguard with cronins! 

* they look gorgeous
* they feel about as hard as 80A kegels
* they feel quite a bit more uncomfortable than my 76A 90mm flywheels
* they have very good grip on, like really really good! cant make my vanguards rear break out with these

i had a problem with the inner bearing core and the trampa pulley: if you fasten the screws handtight, the retainer works great and even compresses the bearing seat, the pulley though seems to deform the bearing seat so that it actually opens up. bearing was very loose and did ticking noise when you spun the wheel. had to loosen the screws a lot and fixate them with a lot of loctite.

Hope that helps. Six bolts can build up a lot of pressure without noticing it! Bolts sit quite loose. Interlocking does happen on the urethane. The extended puley teeth grip into the urethane, preventing any slip. So the bolts are not really under strain. The carve board bearings are slightly oversized and bolts can be a bit tighter, using the 9.55mm ID carve board bearings. I would not use the wheel for skate bearings when you have used carve board bearings before. The oversized carve board bearings slightly stretch the plastic over time and the replacement skate baearings will in consequence sit a bit loose. When clicking occurrs, your bolts sit to tight. Lock paste schould alsways be used!

ok, i rode the trampa 90mm 76A stickies for about 20km now. through the night on finally dry roads ... and Im super stocked about them: they are super silent, super soft and smooth and about as grippy as my abec11 90mm 75A. could let the rear break out on hard carving turns just like on my abecs, but it happened in a smoother softer way and not with a sudden loud fart sound when the urethane slipped on the road.

they ride better than my 90mm 75A abecs right now - might be the breaking in phase though, not sure how theyll perform after a few hundret kilometers.

its very hard to believe that this is supposed to be the same urethane thats used on the 83mm stickies which Ive been riding for a few months. @trampa did you change anything on the urethane mixture? new manufacturer maybe? the 83mm 76A stickies are really quite hard, loud and somehow a little more grippy.

big thumbs up for the 90mm stickies - its my new favourite wheel! :heart_eyes:

83 next to 90mm. you can already see that the surface is more rough on the 83s and looks sonehow softer and smoother on the 90s. breaking in? maybe! they ride exactly how they look

ran the wheels for another 50km, think they actually grip better than my flywheels while being softer and smoother at everything they do. tar is still pretty cold and there is a lot of dust/salt on the roads too - think theyll just grip better towards spring/summer than now. its fantastic, Im in love! :slight_smile:

Hi, as always, we make the good Things even better. The urethane of the new wheels is of insane quality, which unfortunately ads to the price. We think ist worth every penny.
The rebound is set to: No chance to improve any further. 

We would like to offer them cheaper but we can't. Quality to price is very well balanced already.

I'm aware of the 125mm urethane wheels, but as you told me in messages, the hub is too wide for the caliber II axles.

Happy enough with my ABEC 97's, just wanted to know if you have any inkling of marketing larger long board wheels in the near future is all.

Even if they would fit the caliber 2, the truck really wants to be wider. Wheelbite....
90mm is really the max at this stage. I personally think they are a very good balance. Truth is: If a 90mm is to small, the 97 is probably not performing any better but just ads weight. So we will offer the 90mm for the now. I personally love my 76a 83mm Stickies.

Its actually for the extra speed. You get a decent speed bump from the 90mm to 97mm. It lets you get past the 25mph barrier on the Evolve GTs. You'll have a solid market if you contact Evolve as they don't have any special partnership with Abec.

we had great weather in germany and I probably got 150-200km on the 90mm 76A stickies by now. streets are still somewhat dirty with sand/small stones from winter, but cleaning teams are on their way and partially I had great roads ahead of me already.

changed my opinion on the grip level - by now I think the 90mm stickies got a little less grip than my 90mm 75A flywheels and quite a bit less grip than my 76A 83mm stickies. weird enough its the reason why i preferred flywheels over 83mm stickies: the exitement of a rear thats constantly breaking loose is pretty sweet. :stuck_out_tongue:

@trampa Im not sure how these things fit together - most silent and most comfortable wheel vs. probably least grip of my wheels? :thinking:

@whitepony, remeber they are fresh! Urethane changes its character over a period of time. Also the shore hardness varies by x % from batch to batch. You could pick another set of xyz wheels and may get another result if its from a different batch or simply older/newer.
If I get you right you prefer super silent and comfortable wheels with little grip. The softer, the more rebound, the more silent, the more comfortable, the more grip. When I get you right, our wheels perform better than the competition due to less grip? I don't get the point 100%

Some like the grip to carve harder, others like to slide. I prefer the grip in order to accelerate from corners.

There is all that dirt around at this time of the year (sand and stones and salt). All that sticks to the surface of the wheel and makes it less grippy I guess. Maybe our wheels are a bit softer and catch more of the gunk. Maybe the other brands wheels are older, harder, softer whatever. You will have to wait for better road conditions to really compare stuff. The road surface is also pretty cold these days. Horses for courses....

already with the 83mm stickies I complained about the strong deformation of the core/bearing seat after I installed the trampa pulley. now, after just about 500km, the core of my new 90mm stickies broke in 2 places, even though I used the trampa pulley without any pressure of the 6 screws.

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/8/3/83e687fdf5531b93f5bd3f10ae717cef214cdbe3.JPG" width="490" height="500">

as far as I know @Nowind had a similar problem with 83mm stickies. maybe the core is not strong enough of these wheels - an abec flywheel core feels a LOT more solid and surely is a different material. had 2 sets of flywheels with more than 5000km on the clock and a really tight pulley without any problems. you can feel the core very well when you remove bearings with some wiggle motions - kegels are supertight and wont let go of bearings, flywheels are also clinging to bearings - but not as much as kegels. for stickies they come out very easily and you can feel the core deforming without much resistance when you try to get them out.

@trampa hoping for a replacement wheel and, unless this is just a material issue in only my wheel, I feel like something should be changed when it comes to the core of the wheel. Im not a very aggressive rider, I would say I put VERY low load on belts and wheel pulleys (Im also running really loose belts to get the max range) - the only load I put on wheels is from hard carving at constant speed. I specifically set up your pulley following your instructions, I use precision bearing spacers with bones swiss 6 bearings and I tighten down wheel nuts in a reasonable fashion: handtight, then opening a quarter turn ... just enough so that you can see the bearing spin absolutely free. 

I can send in the wheel with pulley if you like to examine it firsthand. 

switched to my beaten up backup kegels now :stuck_out_tongue: @esk8 precision pulley - its really the best seated pulley I know! :heart_eyes:

@trampa and me exchanged a few PMs yesterday, and Ill be getting a replacement wheel and also a reworked pulley that has a different seat - from what I understand its seated on the core instead of biting into the urethane (which seemed to lead to the deformation of the core and opening of the bearing seat and ultimately probably kills the core). 

lets see how that works out! very positive about the customer support, bit sceptical though if a new pulley seat is the solution - the core feels very different to abec flywheels & kegels and its definitely softer ... but thats something frank will have to explain in more detail. :slight_smile:

Hi Builders, I personally never had a core splitting apart so far. It happend on three cores only ( @nowind / @whitepony )
Since it only happened on the driven wheel, I changed the design of the pulley face and now it locks in position like a dream, running so centered that you can't see any whobble at all - looks like spinning the part on a lathe. Now there is no strain on the hub caused by the pulley mount - I checked the dimensions of the bearing seat before and after mounting the pulley. There is no widening, not even a 1/100mm. Since our design uses 6 x M4 bolts, delivering the power (without any play) to the outer end of the spoke, there is no strain on the core from the power input. 
I have absolute confidence, that splitting hubs or loose bearings are a matter of the past. Next week all 37 teeth pulleys will get the rework.

Wish you made an Insert Wheel Pulley with its own bearing instead of the bolt on version, ..this would be the best solution especially since Trampa axles are larger in diameter.

Just curious to know why you don't like Pulleys with Bearing Inserts,..IF the Axle can take the load like on Trampa Trucks ?

On ordinary Trucks with 8mm Axles I also don't like Insert Pulleys because you have to cut part of the Truck Off, leaving part of Bare Axle unsupported.

...Also I wonder if the Stickies 90mm Bearing seat was designed for Ordinary Bearing which have a O.D of 22.03 vs the ones used for the Trampa trucks (R6 2RS) O.D 22.26mm ?

well, the scenario for me is always ronins and they would need cutting. incase of the truck being wide and solid enough yea sure, why not. extra bearing noise, 9 bearings instead of 8, and no real super benefit except for some axial load reduction (which Im not convinced that its necessary). why make stuff complicated when it works very well when its simple? ;)

about the bearing size: I cant tell - maybe thats why the bearing come off easy? @trampa will know the details about which bearings were meant to be!

The Stickies are designed for 608 bearings but also take the R62RS. 0.2mm more OD is no issue for a flexible plastic bearing seat.

Yes, all of them. It's only the 37mm pulley BTW that can squeeze the urethane when you are not careful.
The mod can even be done with a file in 10-15 minutes. Simply file down the edge of the inner teeth in a 45°angle.
Clamp the pulley to a table and use a rather coarse file. 10 minute later you pulley fits like like a dream, spinning centred like on a lathe. Try the pulley on your wheel until it slots straight down on the core. All 6 bolt ends sit flush with the surface on the inside of the pulley, when mounted. Beautiful!
Some dents or uneven filing on the inner teeth dosn't matter, since the belt will never ever travel there. They sit inside the wheels inner contoure.

today I went back from 1 month daily kegel to 3x 90mm stickies and 1x 90mm abec 75A. looks a little stupid but omg, did I miss soft 90mm wheels. hopefully my replacement wheel will arrive soon.

attached the new pulley to one of my "old" stickies. not really convinced the core is going to stay healthy, because I had a 33T pulley which was seated on the core only. :thinking:

wish the pulley was a little more narrow. right now I have uneccessary leverage which adds tilting pressure to the core. @trampa why is it so wide? is it meant to be used with 21mm belts?

If you don't mind, i will pick it up in Nottingham on Saturday and stick it in the German post on Monday. Faster than royal mail. I will also send you a new 33 pulley.

width is 21mm because a 15mm belt wants a 21 mm pulley. Depending on the mount, the belt can swim a bit.
The long Urban Carve mounts have some minor flex and depending on the direction of spinning the motor, the belts can flow to the left and right. Trampa is a bit like Lego. A lot of things connect to a lot of other stuff and you can build many different kinds of boards from the same components. So certain tolerances need to be in a certain way. Maybe 19mm would also be good. The option to ride 20mm belts is nice. 

If you like I can lathe your new 33 pulley down to 16-17mm.

oki with the german mail (even though its only tuesday, think royal mail wouldve been faster). :stuck_out_tongue:

why a new 33T pulley? did you change them to be more core friendly? the 37T pulley looks flat like my 33T pulley, so unless you have found an issue and resolved it, I wont need a new 33T pulley. cant return your 37T pulley either, cause it has already 40km on the clock. used another motor with 230Kv to adjust the different gearing 33->37T ;)

used last weeks bad weather to read a little on lathe & co (I inherited a small lathe from my grandad a few years ago). used my knowledge to lathe down the trampa pulleys so that I would just have it as wide as I need for my 15mm belts!

very happy with the results and it will probably help with the forces on the core too!

Looks good but imo there doesn't look like there's much material left on the pulley to provide slack for the belt to move slightly, perhaps it doesn't even need the extra width?

Side to side slack depends on the motor pulley's Width inside the Flanges , I'm pretty sure Whitepony's Motor Pulley are 16mm (inside flanges) ,I have bought some from same vendor.

....This leaves Only  0.5 mm movement possible from side to side.

I have other motor pulley's that have 17mm inside flanges allowing more side to side movement.

All the other wheels are 100% fine. The wheel probably caught something on its path and the hard carving did the rest to it.
People drink beer and and smash the bottles... 
The urethane we use is a well proven high spec product and we haven't seen anything like that happening in the past.
Since no other customer had such issues, it's a single case, single wheel. If it was an issue of the urethane, I would expect the other three wheels to show similar damages, especially the driven ones. 
Keep on carving and use your spare wheel I sent you earlier this year.

still riding the wheel, somehow grip is still quite nice! very happy with the 90mm stickies overall, nearly 1000km on them, coning a little now which just adds more grip. today I had such a blast, sunny weather, hot tar, back on my vanguard and breaking loose the boards rear end at the end of every swing ... man, I just love this! :heart_eyes:

grip- and comfort-wise, they are on flywheel 90mm 75A level, at least now with the slight coning. the issues I had with the breaking core and now the urethane damage are an ok price to pay for the extremely sweet looks. Im just not a big fan of the flywheel green that, at some point, always becomes muddy dark green. :stuck_out_tongue:

You seam to carve the s...t out of them! 1000Km in that short period of time - respect!
Glad you like them as much as we do. We didn't compromise on the urethane quality, so they should perform just as good as other high spec wheels. I'm pretty sure you just had some bad luck with catching some glass on your path.
Your core should be fine with the new pulley design. I reworked all of them.

uhm, think I probably rode flywheel vs. stickies for the VERY first time back to back on the same board. before I had different boards, longer winter break and many other things that prevented a REAL comparison I guess.

must admit, flywheels were really a step up in smoothness and grip compared to stickies - weird how they feel so different now somehow. felt like stickies were supersmooth out of the box, but they were comparably hard and loud now next to my old beaten up flywheels.  :open_mouth:
