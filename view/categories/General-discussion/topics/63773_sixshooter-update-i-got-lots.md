You need to move your base of operations to australia. 

I will be getting me a set of these very soon though despite the shipping and wait they are worth every penny.

Me too! Been üö¥‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è 24 miles each weekend. Used to do that before the kid and Esk8.  Disturbing how much harder it is after almost 4 years and a ‚Äúfew‚Äù extra pounds. First day back, I got dehydrated and almost passed out

Ran a 5k in key west 2 weeks ago...almost died.  Busted my shoulder and cant swim laps any more, so now need to run.  I hate running.  I might have to get a bike.

DIY can be cheaper it just depends on your set up. My dual 6374 12s4p Evo cost significantly less than a Boosted yet it's outperforms it in every catagory expecpt weight.  But no if you go crazy getting the best and most expensive parts on your build yes you can easily pay more than a boosted.

I want these so bad, got a set of SurfRodz RKP 200mm with 80mm axles on there way. Running 107mm flywheels right now but I‚Äôm sure these would be another level. What size belts are you guys running with what gear ratio?

just went from 107 to 6shooters

first impression, there's a lot more rolling resistance than thanes. 

second, wh draw on average is about double. 

but mostly, they're way more grippy and so much more comfortable. between the pneumatic wheels and thane bushings, the whole setup feels way better suspended. 

having said that, thane wheels feel more responsive to the road. 

at this point I'm of the opinion a pneumie @nd thane board is necessary.
