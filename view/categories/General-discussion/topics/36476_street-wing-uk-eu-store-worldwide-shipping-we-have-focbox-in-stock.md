@bigben Thanks for clearing that up ! I hope when UK exits EU the street wing shop will still be a viable option for folks in the EU.

I think Street Wing is about the only potentially winner from Brexit, it should actually benefit our customers as we won't need to charge VAT to folks in the EU.

Hey guys!
A couple of questions since I'm interested in ordering:

1. Are you going to sell batteries (if s,o when)?
2. Mechanical kits to mount motors (if so, when)?
3. How long is your coupon valid?


Cheers!

At the moment im using 12s 1300mah lipo (three 4s miniquad packs in series). One set gets me to work and another to get me home. Its not ideal but does the job. The long term plan is to build a 12s3p vtc5 pack from some recycled battery packs and a bestech 80A 12s BMS.

Im a BIG guy but have been incredibly surprised by the hill climbing power of a single 6374 motor. The main problem i had with the mono setup was getting enough grip to stop the wheel spinning up in the wet. Only just finished fitting the dual and mounting the electronics somewhere temporary but it feels much safer and reliable when applying power in the wet.

holy mother of god! 12S lipos and 6374 190 kV motor = mucho rapidio!

A dual setup is definitely worth if for the extra grip and not needing to carry the board or push kick home if a belt snaps.

One of the hardest things when planning your first build is working out what components to buy and trying to work out what components are compatible with each other.

The new "Electric Skateboard Conversion Kits"  (can anyone suggest a better name than this?) at Street Wing solve this problem, they contain all the essential ingredients, all you need to add is an enclosure and deck.

@davewood1982 You raise a good point!

January is rubbish! The weather sucks, the days are short and dark, everyone is being boring and not drinking. 

I think a 5% off voucher for Jan is in order to bring a little light to  this bleak month

@stormboard1 - the motor you have has a different sized sensor cable connector than the FOCBOX, but fear not I always include an adapter cable. 

Making those adapter cables is about my least favourite thing about Street Wing - they are silly fiddly to make, but thankfully that is a thing of the past now as I have the factory putting the correct connector on now.

@HighMasterGogo even worse than that, the male connectors are the work of the devil to solder up. I've got better at it but they are so small it really strains my eye sight, it's not often that you wish it was JST crimping instead of the job at hand

Hey @fraannk !

Yes there are available and in stock

[https://street-wing.com/product/6355-260-kv-motor/](https://street-wing.com/product/6355-260-kv-motor/)

These motors do not have the correct plug for FOCBOX however they are supplied with an adapter cable, so completely usable and not inferior to the new batch of motors, it's just means I have a fiddly soldering job to do :slight_smile:

I am actually low on stock on those and needed to print some more. They take ages to print and occasionally the printer plays up and needs some time spent on it so I always try to keep stock to ensure I'm not stuck for a pulley at exactly the wrong time.

This one was going to be the 2nd pulley in your order, it's 35% done in this screen shot:
