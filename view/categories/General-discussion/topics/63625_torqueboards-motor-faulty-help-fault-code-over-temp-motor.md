Hi guys!

I im having problem with my motor saying that FAULT_CODE_OVER_TEMP_MOTOR i solved it by doing like this guy https://vesc-project.com/node/428.

And i really belive that diyelectricskateboard sent me a bad motor because when i recived it it had a loosegoosy wire flying in mid air:https://imgur.com/a/8M0WUIv i sent them instant mail back in may and got no awnser now 4 months later when im finally finishing my build and connecting it to escape i get the FAULT_CODE_OVER_TEMP_MOTOR on one of the motors. And trust me i did test with both and i am sure that i got a bad motor from them.

How to solve this properly? Feels weird just to have a pin unplugged....

And diyelectricskateboard isn't much help at al since they are saying that the motor is technically out of warranty and that i have to pay shipping from me and back to me which from where i live it is expensive as fk.
Only the shipping i could buy 4 motors....

Sent first messeage in may and now they got back in touch with me since i had to make a new ticket this is really frusrating me since they said This motor is technically out of warranty.......

Well the messeaged that i got last seemed not very helpful at all and for me to ship the motor would be too expensive.

I want help to solve FAULT_CODE_OVER_TEMP_MOTOR that i got when i connected the sensor cable, the souloution at the moment was to remove the temp signal. Any other soultions?

 Had the same problem with my tb 6355. Removed the pin and it's all good! Maybe same batch?
