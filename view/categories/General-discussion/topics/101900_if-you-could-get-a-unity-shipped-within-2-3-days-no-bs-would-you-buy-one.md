Just ordered mine from @mackann at Bioboards.  No BS, and shipping is not $113 to the US.  Just gotta type in the correct address and you will see the right options.

Its a bug im working on atm that happens to a few. The price is 1/10 of that.
I think i will solve it today.

The problem is for some reason it allows it to go the checkout with other value then SEK.
And the shipping only calculate in SEK but when having USD it will display in USD but the amount in SEK.
And USD is around 10x times more worth then SEK so thats why it shows so expensive. I will update here when its fixed.

Before you buy:
My unity died after only 2 weeks and i found a burn in one of the connectors.
I contacted them last week and marked the ticket as "critical". What a joke. Like they gonna be answering any faster...
Enertion is on my black list now.![20191015_205124|374x500](upload://stjJRQiCI3qxzh0q3Rl7H6FGA5p.jpeg)
