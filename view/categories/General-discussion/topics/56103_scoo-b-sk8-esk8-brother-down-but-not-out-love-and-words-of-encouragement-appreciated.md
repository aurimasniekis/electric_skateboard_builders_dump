Hey guy's 

@Scoo_B_SK8  had a crash yesterday and worked his knee pretty bad.  I have known him a short time but he is a true eSk8 brother and will be out of action for awhile.  I am sure he would appreciate your thoughts and encouragement. He had his protection gear on however it appears something went wrong with the motor controller and threw him at 20mph.   I will let Scoo_B_SK8 share more if he is up to it.  

Thanks Guy's in advance,

Kevin

Thatâ€™s a shame, he has my best wishes! 

@Scoo_B_SK8 I am a few months out of knee surgery, hit me up if you have any questions, and I wish you a speedy recovery!

Wishing @Scoo_B_SK8 a speedy recovery! Happy to hear he had protection on - I imagine it could have been worse without it.

Heal fast brotha!
