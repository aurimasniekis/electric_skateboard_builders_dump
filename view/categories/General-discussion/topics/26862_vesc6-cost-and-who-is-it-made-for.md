Haven't seen anyone even question the cost on the VESC6 but it looks like a complete dual build with VESC6 would cost $680 just with the ESC parts.

Seems like an insane Hike considering FOCBOX or other VESC work just fine for average Joe builders. I understand some performance upgrades on the VESC6 can be amazing to have but 3x the cost amazing?

Also no need to explain the business reasoning on pricing it this high to makeup for the cost in production tooling and what not. Businesses have to make money to stay in business so i get that part.
I just don't get the marketed consumer the VESC6 is made for. Is it for money bags Joe?(Millionaires or singles who don't have children to take all their money)

Perhaps there is someone with a VESC6 who can chime in.
My only reason to buy a vesc6 is if money is no issue and save a little bit of space in the enclosure and.....longevity may be longer when being put under stress...maybe, time will tell though.

I'm just going to wait around a while and then see if i can get dealer pricing. I have no idea what the rest of you are going to do because yes, the price is ridiculous, no matter how you look at it. 

Focboxes are bad ass. AXLE and OLLIN 4.12s are also bad ass. Until i see precisely what the allure is, there really is none for me. I keep hearing about how hardened they are. I've seen a few videos. People i respect are talking them up. But for me, personally, its all vaporware until i have it in my board and can feel the difference with my own body and see that it doesn't fail when most other ones would and if it actually performs better under most circumstances. Its going to take a lot for me personally to justify the cost. However, they will be an option in my builds even at that ludicrous price point.

I think this question can and will get answered in many ways. PERSPECTIVE.

You see it a few times a day, people saying they can make the lightest, fastest, most advanced e board ever! (for $400) They can't and never will, but they persist. And suckers buy their shit without question.

You've built countless builds for yourself and others and you know without doubt to get 25-30mph, climb 6% grades and go for 20 to 25 miles your board will not weigh less than  17lbs and will not cost lest than $1500. 

You are constantly reminded that you have to buy the good parts if you want a good build and that you get what you pay for, but you still think you can do it better for less.

-I think, that unless it delivers the capability to withstand 150a continuous, allow much more than 60k erpm and not burn out when a servo splitter is dangled over it that I'm going go about my business like it never existed.

I don't care how good Vesc6 is, I'm not paying over $700 usd for a pair of them shipped. 
I believe in buying quality parts and both of my builds cost well over $1000 but you gotta draw the line somewhere.

VESC SIX is made to last and perform under more extreme conditions and can be used with equipment having high amp draw and high ERPM, low resistance motors, high KV motors etc. The applications are endless. VESC SIX makes use of all the new firmware features like three phase measurement for super stable and smooth FOC. I'm pretty sure we will see a lot of different VESC designs soon, and some will be more expensive, and others cheaper. You can buy a smartphone for 70 or 700 these days. There are probably good reasons to buy one for 70, as there are good reasons to buy one for 700. 

BTW: 150K ERPM is tested, up to 80A + continuous is not problem, depending on your heat distribution.
Motors with very low resistance do also work just fine now. Hardware 4.xx simply can't handle that. 
We have switched from full forward to full backwards in 0.05 seconds, using quite big motors in FOC under load. Some robots do such crazy fast movements. So you want the hardware to cope with that.
Not everyone uses these controllers for skateboarding! You have no clue for what these ESCs are being used for, other than skateboarding. The applications are endless. Benjamin is being approached by all sorts of startups and well established companies. So for sure he wants to show a hardware being without any compromise and up for many tasks.
Firmware and hardware need to go hand in hand.

Current pricing:

Assuming you are outside Europe, the VAT does not apply!
Without VAT:
Price is as low as 187 Pound if you buy it with a board.
If you buy a twin, they cost 216 each
If you buy 4 VESC SIX, you get them for 208 each.
If you buy 10, the price will drop to 187.

If you compare that to existing hardware, cheaper to make, the price is quite realistic.
Its is a superior design to hardware 4.xx and the price is simply according. 
You also have to note that only a very few vendors donated something to Benjamin.
So they did not price in R&D and project support, but rather used Open Source availability to lower the price.

You can easily spend 500+ € on a single motor controller that is as smart as a potato, allowing only BLDC and voltage control. VESC-based hardware is very cheap if you compare that in the market - plus it can do all sorts of things other ESCs simply can't. It is a full scale industrial grade controller at the price of hobby equipment. So you are all lucky that this piece of software and hardware exists for such a low prices.

I did get two of these for science and to support the idea........

Reasoning as follows:

1. The electrical vehicle industry is still budding, I want to see it make big advances and I feel this controller is a staging device for things to come.

2. I want to build with top notch parts. I have some money ( not a lot) and can afford to purchase such ammenities. I do not own a car, commute by public transport bike and e skate  and value quality crafted goods and tools. 

2.5. money talks, euros put towards the advance of things I love and value rather than a driving/flying vacation/ lavish dinner still seems like the best option.

3. Vedder is a fucking stud......I want to support him.

4. Trampa has been making some sick shit for a few years, I want to support them.

Can you build stupid awesome boards sin VESC 6.0? Totally. 

Is it stupidly expensive and not for everyone? Abso-gawd-damn-lutly. 

Is the naming debate rediculous? Somewhat.  

Is FOCBOX a great name and did I have fun making up new names for VESC? You bet your sweet ass.

Having learned so much from ES and this forum Im now researching drones, 3d printed and considering building an ebike ( any of you see vector bikes new light frAme!!!) VESC 6.0 can be used with ebikes ! The possibilities of expansion are truly legit.

Ultimately I supported this project because I don't have the know how /time to do it and I think it will lead to better things for our community, as I did when I bought the V1.0 gold motor mount and the original VESC Enertion produced, or the v1.0 of pyschotiller cases, or the VESC 4.10 from Ollin, or DIY V3.0 mounts. LHB I would buy your boards if I didn't love tinkering so much and get joy from building myself. Beer/ garage time is the best. I grew up with that. I love seeing you get your family involved.

Time and money are needed for most growing industries. I'm happy and sleep well knowing I'm giving to the ones I believe in.

Much e skate /skatan/ e vehicle  love,

Hunter

Similar story as @monkey32.  I have a pair of VESC Six from @trampa.  I was able to get them during the initial beta price, and actually ordered *on my birthday* - as a bday gift for myself.

I've spent over $200 (250 iirc) for an 8s Mamba 2 ESC - and it ran like crap (the squeal brakes, and none-to-throw-you adjustment).  I stopped f'ing with car ESC's and moved to VESC way back 4.6, and first 4 i got direct from Ben himself.

I've always tried to support Ben, not just use his work.  I've split profits on his/fechter's anti-spark switches (sold extras) and have contributed multiple times to what i feel is an underappreciated contributor to esk8.  Money where my mouth is.

Similarly - i had a chance to get the new version, giving me ability to run 12s and FOC (to be tested - i'm slow), and most importantly support Ben as he tries to mature his offering.  TM and partnership w/ expertise as provided by Trampa seems like a win.  I feel like so many folks have ridden Ben's work for their own benefit, not giving back, it's overdue he does something to make his work sustainable.

I am excited to see the open source release of the VESC Six reference.  Can't wait to see the competition and improvements from Chaka, Enertion, Axle, and DIYes of it!  Look forward to the price leveling out a bit with multiple options depending on your budget!

And i hope people still donate and help Ben continue to work on these!  I am excited to see the VESC Tool start to support 4.xx hardware and simplify the configuration for v4's!

Thanks for the responses. Everyone is making very valid points. Some which I disagree with but that's just a matter of opinion.

A couple things stand out so far.
1. VESC6 can be an overkill for the basic eboard hobbyist. 
2. VESC6 is meeting a higher standard to further support other use cases in robotics, EVehicles such as cars, scooters, bikes buggies, go karts, rockets, and whatever else you want to go fast as hell and not blow up the ESC. :slight_smile: 
3. We are buying them to support Ben. (&Trampa business cost)

So the VESC6 is roughly $80USD more than my VESC4.12+heatsink+warranty. Doesn't seem like that much of a price hike if it performs as advertised and comes with a warranty. 

There are always cheaper products on the market, but you get what you pay for. It doesn't make sense to compare the VESC6 to the cheapest 4.12 on the market. It's not cheap, but if it's all it's cracked up to be, it seems like a fair price. It's not like you can't pick up a cheaper 4.12 if you don't need the extra performance. For those who need it, it's worth it. I still overheat my VESC 4.12 from time to time. The VESC6 should solve that issue entirely.

Need some assistance in math because i suck. lol That and THe site is horrible with showing conversion to U.S. dollars and it doesn't make sense when i select shipping in U.S. and it shows in UK pounds.... *Scratching Head*

So in lbs conversion as it shows

The VESC6 is now out of stock! BUT we are making more & taking pre-orders for all that wish to be first.The VESC will be sent to you in the next weeks: Please supply me with 2 x VESC @ rrp £275 per VESC	£260	 	
 	 	 	£560
This would Equal $362 per VESC6. Am i Missing something because that is not $80.00 less than any vesc with or without heatsinks. Its over $100.00 more and that is a lot of money for powering one little motor.

In all fairness, those are very impressive specs and I can imagine that they would be a real advantage for mountain boards
or even a street board for someone who wants to obtain insane speeds.
You might want to see about fixing your website because it did not remove the vat tax in the shopping cart when I tested it to see what the total cost would be, Thus the over $700 usd that I quoted.

Hi, @Jaraya92881, the website clearly states: 
Price includes 20% VAT
NON EU customers purchase VAT Free.  
Deducting 20% is not to much of a job, and we believe most people are capable of that.

@Namasaki: The VAT will be deducted, once you check out. 
There is a simple reason for that: You could pick a shipping address in Europe, but have your billing address outside the EU. In that case we have to apply the VAT. 
So please go forward and have a look at the bill that is being generated before you finally pay. 

@DougM :  The cheapest offer is 187GBP (excl. VAT) if you buy 10, or if you purchase them with a twin drive board.
We believe that is a very good price for a controller like the VESC 6. Well made motor controllers ain't cheap

You could have a single strong motor, nearly as strong as a twin setup with lower spec controllers and motors.
It's quite impressive what a strong single drive is capable of - more power than most people can deal with. Not everyone lives in SF or in Switzerland. 

I'm not sure if Brexit will ever happen. Poor Theresa...
To bad when you promised the public something it can't have. That tasty cake simply doesn't exist.
People and politicians will get real as soon as some major companies/banks will start moving to some other EU countries because they need real cake for survival.
No matter what the outcome will be, it will not affect us to much.

I don't see any problem with price. As every product you can choose between different price categories depending how you value that exact product. For example exaggerate by generalism 1000e Iphone 7 isn't too expensive for me but 25e anti-spark switch is.

FOCBOX delivered to me cost 205e so VESC 6 isn't that expensive for EU people...

I think the exact price varies day to day due to rates, but generally I've seen it in the $270-$300 USD range. I didn't do any conversion. Just what the site says. Factor in group buys and we can get the price down a bit more. So between $70-$120 or so difference in price depending on rates and how many you buy. Never seen it at $360. Perhaps on a bad day for the dollar.

Ditto on that. The only reason I'd want to upgrade is to get reliable FOC. I've never touched it due to the mixed results with 4.xx versions. I wonder if FOC on VESC 6 is any quieter. I've heard from a couple people that FOC is just as loud as BLDC at high speeds.

FOC is completely silent even at high speeds, although I'm running direct drive so my ERPM won't be as high. But FOC shouldn't be any different on VESC 6 than 4.xx. Just possibly more stable.

> made a quick video of 50A accelerating and -16A braking of the SK6374 with my german FOC vesc. its interesting, cause its only really ninja-silent when its slow and from mid-speed onwards to the max its nearly as loud as bldc. not sure if its simply the sound the motor makes or if the sound can be attributed to the driving ESC?

The reference HW design will be the next to be released after the software. So no worries, we are not far away from the releases.

No matter whether you buy 1 or 10
There are still 3% for paypal fee by Trampa
V4.12 was an open cource project.
Everyone had the opportunity through the Bom list
The prices for the components to find out
As a result, the market for Vesc was transparent
Components and BCB were priced by 1 pieces  at $ 80
Added to this were the production costs
The price has been reduced by high production numbers
The most expensive on the V4.12 were the DRV, SMT32 and the shunt
DRV and SMT32 are still there were other components
But on the whole we are talking about a maximum of 10-15% higher
Price for the components.
But the production costs are cheaper, since the V4.12
Consists of two parts and the whole new controller
Only one component.
In the V4.12, more work steps are necessary
You can look at times the front and the back of the PCB
And you get it by yourself

FOCBox round about 180.-€ with al cost to Europe without Guarantee 1 piece

Do you price in R&D (e.g. through substantial project support), moulding costs, CNC housing, second PCB, X-Ray testing, warranty etc? Most vendors forget about R&D, which is most of the cost involved.

All the work is in the software R&D and no one could sell a single VESC-based hardware without Benjamin banging hard on the stuff. So everyone crying about cost should consider the fact that most of the cost involved (R&D) was swallowed by Benjamin in the past. Time=Money
Hope that will change soon...

[/quote]

That's an intangible, you can make it any value/price you want and no one can disprove it but neither can you prove it.  

What @esk8 is saying is that cost of the V4.12 VESC was transparent because it was "actually" open source since the BoM and firmware/software was available to everyone to verify the cost and look for ways and means to change things to make it better.  

So far, that is not he case with VESC6.

They should be cooler...more volts less current.

So where can I get a VESC6? Why only Trampa?  Why so expensive? Oh the R&D.. not because Trampa has cornered the market by buying a trademark? $340 shipped to US.. get outta here Frank.
[/quote]

Trampa makes great products but the VESC6 price is steep -- I bought a few... no problems.

But I also decided to hedge my bets, in case they don't release the original reference hardware design like for a year or two.  Or their units have issue and run into some situation where they aren't warrantied.

@stewii is selling VESC6 clones based on the VESC6 schematics released by Benjamin Vedder. I jumped in and ordered a couple. They are about 50% of the price.  He says the PCB and components cost about $70 total (converted from pounds). Of course he has to make a profit and also the hard work is putting in to solder on the components. He is also selling just the PCB's alone as well.  

A caveat about the pricing so this is sort of fair and balanced.  These units you will have to solder on the motor leads (super easy imo) and the +/- terminals for the power source (also easy). These are marked on the board.  Also right now that price includes the vesc and the cover but not the CNC aluminum housing. @Kug3lis is offering a CNC housing for 25 euros. Also, Trampa itself sells (2) VESC6's for 187 pounds (last I checked) if you buy a complete electric board from them. So all these factors should be considered. 

Here is link to his thread:

If you buy them with a board, 187 GBP is the price. US customers usually pay 240 GBP for a single unit. I hope @stewii has priced some $$ in for Benjamin. 95% of the hardware vendors forget to do so. Cheap Cheap Cheap and let's forget about software development.... Without the software those units would not spin a motor a quarter turn.

That's the magic right there... I was thinking about that :)

On a separate note -- why are still so crazy about FOCBox when there is the VESC6 and @stewii VESC6 clone (ESCape its being called I guess) ?  I know FOCBox run really really well and read a lot of good news about them being very robust and the like.  But it's old technology now right? 

All those little questions are just pre-text for... when are the big boys like Enertion going to release their OWN VESC6 ?  I mean if @stewii got the open source schematics and made a reliable clone.  He is just a small guy... any of these big boys like Enertion can surely hire a engineering college kid and do the same right?  Or are we waiting on the reference design to be released by BV? I checked the vesc project website and it says he will release it soon.  I am sure he will but he maybe busy or it take a very long time. Wouldn't it behoove us to do what @stewii did?  Assuming what he is doing is legal as the schematics were released open source.

The silence on this issue is deafening if you know what I mean.

Why does this all matter to me? I am buyer and I need more VESC's in 2018.

@chaka doesn't have to. His v1.1 is unkillable and the format is desirable for his application. IT has all the primary benefits of a 6 with the 4.12 format convenience for his space constraints. Not to mention the extras. Ollin has been fine tuning that thing constantly for a long time now. Fine tuning, not reinventing and surrounding with politics. 

@onloop did exactly the opposite. Enertion took the format and left it mostly 4.12 in nature save the direct fets and a few good layout and component upgrade decisions. @blasto and @JohnnyMeduse have been feeding them with feedback and improvements since day one based on the failures they've seen.  At this point the FocBox is both no longer a 4.12 and not yet a VESC6. I have helped contribute to this by deliberately sending my broken vescs to @JohnnyMeduse who is  associated with enertion for repairs and i have been promoting his services. Why? Because i want the focbox and anything after it to meet my increasingly demanding needs. We don't have to come out and say it, we know its a mutually beneficial relationship. I've been associated with Enertion since the beginning. Nothing new here. 

Enertion is in a position to provide me with an excellent product that does exactly what i need it to for exactly the right price and they listen to me when i tell them shit ain't right. Any time i post something of interest, anytime i ask questions, @blasto and @JohnnyMeduse are right fucking there pointing shit out and that's how its fucking done.  If i'm pushing boundaries and they notice, they ask questions, warn me about things, let me know good info.

I didn't ignore it, I just don't agree with it. From my standpoint why would I upgrade to a device that has a larger footprint and has fewer config possibilities?  You used the word 'old' when I think you meant 'earlier'.  You are making the assumption that an earlier iteration is not as good as a later iteration and it's just not true. 

I can see using the VESC6 for a MTB that needed 120a delivery, but there is no benefit over the FocBox for street boards, but there are deficiency issues as related above.

i only went the vesc6 route because months back from when i first got into the hobby.

So basically you’ve never try a Focbox or Ollin 1.1... ? 

If you want to know, from personal experience there not enough difference between a Focbox and a Vesc 6.0... you should try 😜. We where event able to bench test a motor up to 130Erpm in foc withpuy damaging anything (which is 30k over the absolute limits).

Haven't seen anyone even question the cost on the VESC6 but it looks like a complete dual build with VESC6 would cost $680 just with the ESC parts.

Seems like an insane Hike considering FOCBOX or other VESC work just fine for average Joe builders. I understand some performance upgrades on the VESC6 can be amazing to have but 3x the cost amazing?

Also no need to explain the business reasoning on pricing it this high to makeup for the cost in production tooling and what not. Businesses have to make money to stay in business so i get that part.
I just don't get the marketed consumer the VESC6 is made for. Is it for money bags Joe?(Millionaires or singles who don't have children to take all their money)

Perhaps there is someone with a VESC6 who can chime in.
My only reason to buy a vesc6 is if money is no issue and save a little bit of space in the enclosure and.....longevity may be longer when being put under stress...maybe, time will tell though.

I get that part their vesc is insanely priced and really killed my wallet which is why i got on board with @stewii after he started making clones from the open source released schematics. I just thought that's what enertion and others were going to do when the  reference design is released by BV. But i guess if people are saying FOCBox is a beast already that plan isn't necessarily the move they want to take

i make a lot of educated guesses about Enertion, and occasionally, i'll even post my guesses. Most of them i keep to myself though because i know they're right, they end up being right, and it would have made them look bad or possibly inconvenience them had i said something at the wrong time. ITs a precarious balance of knowing and wanting to say but not knowing if i should. 

but i will simply posit the following based solely on what i have seen in public and nothing i know from being an insider: Enertion will have a motor controller that is not only closer to the 6 in hype as well as type, but will surpass it in performance. Raw amps and erpm performance. If i had to call it, i'd say late 2018 we will hear something beyond guessing. What makes me say that? Jason's Tick Tock is akin to Intel's. Tick on new, Tock on stock. He's already ticked through ESC, sleds, drive systems, and component accoutrements. Next will be his Tock on those supplies, and that has already started with his newish vendor program. Tick will be returning soon enough, and the place in my opinion to tick the most will be the ESCs super beefed for offroad hill climbing as well as on. Heavier everything in there for more amp throughput and more safegurds against accidental electronics death. There's already video out there of their fine engineers showing us, the consumers, how to deliberately fry things and then how they addressed the problem that caused it. 

If they have no plans on this, then they're probably thinking of cashing out the company and retiring for cocktails.

Now I get it....you guys don't need any of that --- `we will release reference design for VESC6`.. it's all Kabuki theatre from Trampa to make everyone feel good.

Enertion gonna crush em with this new product when they come out and their vendor distribution network and their field testing.  Really sad that Trampa just went the way of making a very expensive product and not follow thru the same way with a reseller program and decent pricing.  Instead they choose to copyright, hoarde the trademark, and go it alone.

I can't wait until 2018... I like what you guys are saying. Really exciting times ahead it seems :)

Well I talked to a guy who knows BV personally and he was sure that Vedder doesnt get a dime from Enertion. He did not want to be paraded around on the forum. If you dont believe me, just ask Vedder himself!

Concerning Trampa:
Is 300$ single piece for a pcb with some components a lot? Hell yeah.
Is what Trampa is doing with the Vesc6 cool? I don't know. Not sure I even understand exactly what they are doing. 
What I do know though is that they actually make sure the guy who worked on creating the product for years in the first place gets a fair cut. Their company further developing the thing in cooperation with Vedder makes sure this can actually become more than a time consuming hobby for him.
He made the whole thing open source, software under GPL because he believes in information being accessible and that everybody should be able to contribute. I don't believe his plan was having large companies use his technology to make big bucks without working with him and I think this is also the reason he and Trampa are starting to TM etc because next thing we know some large ebike, ecar, whatever company starts producing vescs and using them for free solely for their own gain.

All I know for a fact is that it's Ben and the Vendors job to work that out, not me as a consumer. 

Saying that @onloop has never given Ben a dime is a pretty loaded way to make a statement. He may have paid Ben's rent or bought him groceries or paid his taxes. Who knows.  If Ben has an issue that he thinks should be public, then he should be over here talking about it.  

I'm sure there is a story there but noone but Ben and Jason know what it is. 

Regarding your statement...

That's cool, I even respect it...but Frank has not taken any steps to.protect me, as a consumer, from an overpriced piece of equipment that I, and most people, don't need. And to be totally honest, Ben kinda sold us all down the river by partnering with Trampa/Frank. 

I don't have a dog in this race, I'll buy what I wanna buy and won't buy what I don't wanna buy.  I'd rather see money and time go into the v4  VESC (yeah I called it a VESC, sue me) that the v6 as the v6 has no measurable benefit to me, as a consumer. 

I won't buy from trampa for the same reason I don't buy from Walmart, I don't like bully's in the marketplace, and I exercise my limited power button not trading with those companies. 

I'll just leave it at that.

I just commented because I love the open source and donation based development movement and get kinda sad when I get the feeling that this is being taken unfair advantage of.

Whatever. The HW 6 can be built and worked on for improvements. You guys just need to step your game up however you like. 

I'm freakin' biased in what I think and I don't care, here are my 2 cents : 

FOCBOXes and successors **damn better be fine tuned and reliable** as many people including me were sacrifices on the first shitty choices made by Jason and Jacob when starting VESCs production with Flier back in the days. 

I mean : I literally **threw away** my money for defective unwarranted VESCs 4 units which needed repair even before use. Not ranting again on the fucker who was supposed to repair them but finished destroying them instead and ran away with my money.

So enough already with the fan service guys, it is just **normal** that it delivers reliable performance. The contrary would be fucking bullshit. 

Whatever performance level you aim for, reliability should remain the first criteria. Period.

Yea, to sum it up : given how the project went awfully pre-FOCBOX, FOCBOX better be a well rounded product. If not that's bullshit. 

Was kinda answering on long insider shot of LHB. 

As for hw6 and what not : files to work on it / develop on it are available. Reference design isn't needed for electronic engineers, sure. It's simply up to people to choose what they'll do with it.

We previously offered a very traceable and transparent way of earning $ per FOCBOX sold, BV didn't register any interest.

We also offered a substantial lump sum contract to BV to bring VESC6 to market at affordable prices. Offer rejected

I'm happy to contribute, I have some innovative ideas too, Perhaps I could "tax" sellers of "VESC" labelled items who freely use this forum to promote their wares. That seems fair.

_$XXXX per month forum access fee for anyone who sells VESC named items, I'll donate this sum minus administration fees to BV._

Who is still leveraging VESC to sell their wares?

I been a software developer for now about 19 years... 15 years of those was on Linux, GCC, and the like. BV is definitely too mum on his expectations after releasing everything open source hoping for donations and now this whole about face in which one party doesn't say anything and we hear only surrogates chime in is very, very weird.

For all we know, this could all just a foiled Bond-villainy plot, give everything away for free, build up the community and then issue a trademark move to try to gain a chokehold on a product. Now I say foiled because outside of this website, nobody cares what VESC means.  If the nextgen FOCBox has better stats and reliability than VESC6 then I am going to buy it. Actually I might buy two right now anyways because I cant afford another $650 for two more VESC's that I am going to need.  I went out with friends this weekend esk8'ing all had Evolve or Boosted or uni-wheel or something along those lines... they were talking about "ECO" mode on their Evolve remote as we went bar hopping along the beltline.  When I tried to explain them VESC and my custom build and how my volt meter says 37V left on my 12S battery they lost interest... a glazed look passed over their eyes. All said one day they will do a custom build. Some may... but if there are a million esk8 boards in the world... if even 10,000 of them are DIY I would be very surprised. And no vendor selling to the general public will advertise the VESC trademark. It doesn't mean anything to consumers... just to us. It's very niche and to try to create a trademark in something very very niche is never going to lead to Bond-villain style world domination. It's just sad.  We will call it VESC here or something else... 99.9999% of the rest of the world that esk8's doesn't even care. They want to plug it in and it work.

Lol... used by e-cars and e-bikes... that is hilarious commentary. Like some Chinese factory is going to print VESC on the side of product like consumers actually care. Nobody cares. Not Elon Musk either.

It was a really really poor move to alienate a small group of people. That's my $0.02

To me the solution is simple.  I did buy a VESC6 and it's a really nice box, but the price is too steep for me to get any more of them.

UNLESS :-)  for "a few dollars more" I could get a Dual Vesc6.  I'm building my first dual motor board and I'll be using twin 4.12's but if I could get a VESC6 Dual for under $400 I'd do it.

The PCB layout time is pretty minimal, just reproducing what you've already done, and the component cost is nominal.  Maybe the biggest cost will be in the firmware update to get dual to run on a single processor, but for a whipsmart code monkey even that shouldn't be more than 2 weeks of work.  Then there's the VESC tool updates.  

It isn't easy, but I think that might be where the sweet spot in the market is for these boxes.  I could be wrong.

You could have a single strong motor, nearly as strong as a twin setup with lower spec controllers and motors.

It’s quite impressive what a strong single drive is capable of - more power than most people can deal with. Not everyone lives in SF or in Switzerland.

I agree, but the braking power of a dual-drive is unsurpassed.  I like dual just because of braking.

Well, If you want to brake harder, you also need a bigger battery to swallow those AMPs pushed towards the cells. The energy needs to go somewhere, and in our case somewhere is the battery.
The Battery is usually the weakest link in the chain. 
So a second motor has a big impact on the total weight and price of your board. Sometimes its good to have a light, cheaper and more portable board. Two ESCs, two motors, double the P-count, bigger switches or two switches.... It gets expensive and more complicated....
