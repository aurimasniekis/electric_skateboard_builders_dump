Just wanted to see who is local in Portland. I know it wet out, and chance to ride are few but maybe we can get a group ride setup for spring? Id like it to be mainly a DIY meetup, and try keep the rebuilt to a minimum. 

I'm open to route suggestions. Springwater Corridor Trail could be fun. Its pave and reasonably smooth. The zoo bomb is another option. I've personally done the Zoo bomb a dozen times on my standard decks, and its a fun ride. 

sound off...

I've got a nice little single motor build. 10s4p, focbox, idlers, and a 15mm belt.

I have a 500w bike style hub motor for it. Just need to figure out how I'm going to lay the electronics. I think it will make a nice wet weather trail build.

Hey I'm in Portland and new to electric boards is there any place to buy parts locally? I need an VESC for my noob board. It's a yuneec ego2 but I have original 2batts with the power switch and 30a bms. I wanna run parallel Batts and jump to 60amp which I heard the motor can take. Any advise?

You can try some of the better hobby stores. Tammies hobby in beaverton has lots of RC stuff like wire, plugs, batterys, chargers and motors. Not sure if those motors will work well on a eskate but they have some. 

Boosted has or had a office in portland. But it is or was just a design shop. No parts or service. 

Batterys plus isn't any help, and are kinda cunts. Won't touch eskate stuff at all.
