Hi guys. 5 days ago a cop stopped me and took my electric longboard (DIY) with him. He told me that it was illegal and that he was going to take some pictures and see if he could give me a fine (he was going to call to the people that know about this). He told me that then he was going to call me and say what to do (he also said that he would give me the bord back).
Do you know the law in switzerland? What can I do?
He also said that normal longboards are also illegal while skateboards are legal... Is it possible?!

Thanks in advance for any help.

I know in Netherlands some cops fine, but some are very friendly to you. It is illegal here but unless your not driving like a madman 35km/h on bike lane taking over bikers, you‚Äôll be fine. I guess you‚Äôre unlucky

No way longboards are illegal.

Yes, I was very unluky. I used the electricskateboard everyday for 1year and 3months, never being stopped by the cops. When he took it from me I was breaking to take the longboard in my hands and walk the pedestrian crossing.

Yes that thing of longboards being illegal but skateboards are not is very very strange.

oh man thats too bad, i'm also from switzerland and i'm sometimes worried about the police when i drive around with my longboad or mountainboard. it really is illegal here and the police can take it away from you.

last time i went to zurich i took my longboard with me and just stayed on backroads but there were these lime scooters driving around everywhere so i was not too worried about police.

you were probably just unlucky and the wrong cop saw you at the wrong time. hope he wont file charges and it goes before a judge, that gets expensive very quickly. 

reminds me like in my youth when the cops were on the hunt for tuned velomotors. they like easy targets.

please keep us updated.

@MarcoMota1
definitely longboard skateboard's are not illegal in the land of cheese and chocolate..
I ll try to stay under the radar with my setup...nice routes near Zurich (Pfannenstiel)...best early in the morning.
good luck getting your board back.

Shit I live in Switzerland too (from France before, moved in this year)
The law says that electric skateboards are illegal, but I haven't got any problem (yet)
Longboards are surely legals, there so much in Lausanne, and if the law say so, I bet you won't have any problem over regular street skateboards

I doubt he stole it from you, but go and check at the police station if they still have it if you're unsure

In switzerland and germoney its illegal because you don't pay taxes to the greedy government for riding a longboard and they say its all about your safety what is a fucking lie. Nobody cares about the millions of alcohol victims or the dead people on the speed unlimited highways in germoney. You can drive 300kmh with your car but skateboarding is to dangerous? Wake up, people! They betrayed our grandparent, our parents and now they betray us. Everything is fine if you ve got enough money to pay your parking tickets. Pool full of greedy suckers.
You even get a punishment in germoney, just for playing cards without a helmet. Nice business model created by assholes to patronize you all and to soften your brains make you believe they mean it well for you.
In our country you will never be old enough to decide for yourself.

i can¬¥t totally agree with it.
even in your germoney you can¬¥t drive everywhere 300 and you can¬¥t drive this 300 with any car you want.
If you have a fucked up car with broken brakes than the government also don¬¥t give you to drive with this car on the street.
Not saying that the rules are accurate regarding electronic vehicles , but things/the law are changing in the moment ... they just super slowly as usual.
It¬¥s not right to compair esk8 with other situations in life, but as you want to do so, you think it¬¥s more save to blast with 300km/h in a car than to blast with 65 km/h on an esk8, maybe even without helmet?  And don¬¥t come me with, "a car can hit also people which not involved in it"... you can harm others with you esk8 too... while riding and while not riding. Just imagine one board going up in flames in a closed room because of a shitty build battery... you want to be close by in this moment?

Hahah, I was walking with the board under my arm. Once a freind told me that in italy since skateboards are illegal his tecnique was that when he saw a cop he putted the earpods in his ears so if the cop managed to stop him he could give the excuse that he couldnt listen him screaming to stop.

Swiss here too. never heard of a differentiation between skate and longboards. they are the same... why would they not be?

I heard of a guy that got caught on the sidewalk with his eskate: 160CHF fine.
Another guy got caught on the street: 650CHF fine

its a motorisiertes fahrzeug ohne strassenzulassung in switzerland.

it doesnt has to be right from my point of view, but its how it feels for me.In germany you can ride an ebike wich goes 30kmh wherever you want without any insurence , but eskateboards are limited to 20kmh since january 2019 as far as i know which is a big bang for this country because before it was completly illegal.  I am not that frustrated as it sounds and we are going forevert here in germany.  Anyways,15bucks would be painfull out here,tooüòâ....
and you are totally right with your thoughts. Things are about to change here slowly as usual but you are right thats ok because someone has to to this complex jobüñíand you are right about accidents and things that could happen with any vihicle on the planet.
All I can say is that children and people are the weakest parts in dayly traffic and I always break for everyone nearly down to zero to demonstrate that i have full control and i can break in time.

@McErono
Thanks, that seems like real figures. if it goes before a judge its ~700CHF, if the police gives you a fine directly 80 - 160CHF is what i would imagine.

@MarcoMota1
I would not argue with the cops too much, it just gets you into deeper trouble. Just say what they want to hear to get your board back and pay a small fine as possible. Always remember the best advice a lawyer once gave me "don't talk to the police" or at least as little as possible ;)

I think it depends totaly on the cops, your board and the speed you are pushing,  when you have a sleeper board with hubs and a small enclosure in foc mode they will think its a normal longboard. I think the moment you start building your board you made already the decision to the stupid rules for EVs here in Germany "entwicklungsland" hahah

Yeah i agree with that. I got  well masked boards, and like i mentioned before, I am the gentleman sidewalk surfer. I only accelerate when there are no people around and that pays off for me, because most people like it and i can go for high speeds at night, because the city i live in is so small, at 3 pm its skaters paradise in the streets because you are nearly alone. Don't think i will get in trouble here in the future.
I ride both, bldc and foc on hubs and in daily traffic theres almost no chance to hear even the bldc motor sound.

well, as i said if its in the "bussenkatalog" and they fine you directly its normally from 10 - 250CHF. If its not in this booklet, it goes before a judge and gets expensive.

You can check the bussenkatalog with the corresponding fines here:

https://www.admin.ch/opc/de/classified-compilation/19960142/201705070000/741.031.pdf

This could be relevant for us, if a board is considered a "fahrzeug√§hnliche Ger√§t":

1. Fahren ohne Licht (Art. 50a Abs. 4 VRV) 20

2. Behinderndes Ben√ºtzen der f√ºr die Fussg√§nger bestimmten  Verkehrsfl√§chen (Art. 50 Abs. 2 VRV) 20

3. Behinderndes Ben√ºtzen der Fahrbahn verkehrsarmer  Nebenstrassen (Art. 50 Abs. 2 VRV) 20

4. Nichtbeachten des Signals ¬´Verbot f√ºr fahrzeug√§hnliche Ge-r√§te¬ª (2.15.3; Art. 19 Abs. 5 SSV) 20

5. Verwendung von fahrzeug√§hnlichen Ger√§ten auf nicht  zugelassenen Verkehrsfl√§chen (Art. 50 Abs. 1 und 2 VRV) 20

6. Missachten des Vortritts der Fussg√§nger (Art. 50a Abs. 2 VRV) 30

All cost 20CHF, i guess nbr 5 is what @directC got.

No to get political here or anything my friend, but Europeans shouldn't spit upwards. Don't eat that shit up about the 'perfect first world countries'. There too, policemen are absent, nowhere to be seen when crimes or attacks occur to their own country men in those tiny nations where supposedly 'everything is perfect' in those 'first world countries'. That last sentence is ambiguous.

...and Brian, the US still one of the greatest countries, perhaps not the best organized, but when they talk and compare a tiny 6 million nation like Denmark, their 'perfect way of life', a 'first world country' against an 'imperfect nation' a 'disorganized country' a 'fallen power' like the US and its 320 million... they don't even know what the heck they are talking about! The US is still a great nation despite their problems and shortcomings. (Just my opinion, and I was not born here by the way :wink:)

Maybe beneath a police mode it could be a useful trick to rebrand the motors with fake stickers of 100 watts or something for switzerland and germany. Maybe for the batteries,too, they just have to look professional(the stickers) and i think they could avoid trouble sometimes on the first look of a policeman in the streets.

Today a friend told me he heard about the new 20 kmh scooter law in germany. HE said the government wants to bring through the law before summer this year. Thats Ok for the beginning and we will only need a simple liability insurance. The question is if e-skateboards also match this law, and if it counts when you're still liability insured or if you need a new insurance for that. As far as I know my country, I bet we will stand outside with our eboards, and if not, we surly need 10000 new insurances and license plates.
