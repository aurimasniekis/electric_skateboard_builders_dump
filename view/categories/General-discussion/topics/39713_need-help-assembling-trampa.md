Hi! I'm completely new to this and I know this is mainly a diy forum,  it I recently purchased an Electric Trampa Mountainboard and it arrived yesterday. I open it up to some amazingness. Then I realized I have to assemble it and I'm a little lost. I assumed it was going to be pre-built, but was wrong (my fault). I reached out to Trampa via FB messenger for help on what goes where. They saw it but haven't replied yet. I messaged them again just a little while ago this evening in hopes they could reply and help. Until then, maybe someone can help me here?

There are some carbon parts I'm not sure where they go and wiring as well. Anyone familiar with this?

It is a molded rubber cover. Not sure if it's standard on all vesc's, but it came with mine.

They come with an internal silicone seal when ordered separately. If ordered with an MTB they will also come with an external rubber sleeve.

Finished assembly, but now have a new problem.  Remote is bonded ( I believe) and  wired  correctly, but nothing is happening. Does it have to do with the vesc's? Do I need to calibrate or program them?

Yes, you need to run VESC-Tool and do the motor setup wizard and input setup wizard.
