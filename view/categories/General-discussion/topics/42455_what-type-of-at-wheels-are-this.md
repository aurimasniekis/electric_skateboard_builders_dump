I am intrigued by this Evolve AT wheels shown in this vid that seem to be wider and fattier than most common Evolve AT wheels. Anybody knows something about them?

They look like standard AT wheels to me. I think the perspective in the video just makes them look extra fat.

If you want FAT wheels, look up @psychotiller's Sixshooter wheels.

They're 7 inch. Looks wider in the vid for some reason.

So strange because the guy in the vid does not look fattier at all. So what gives? The tires look awesome tough.

Yes they look flatter and nice.
It should be a combination of low tire pressure and something about aspect ratio of the video

The guy in the vid said the tires came with the 2-1 AT kit for the Bamboo (??) Some there asked the same question about the tires.

I could be wrong idk, they do look quite a bit wider. I think it's mainly just low tire pressure though.

Where'd you find the stats? I've got a couple sets of the first that are listed (175 x 50), but they all say 50 PSI, not 36. Wondering if it was a typo? Not seeing any wider tires listed on their site.

No man, watch carefully... read what is printed on  the tire's rubber side.

* Evolve's 7" inch AT tire image posted in their site. You read on the tire's side: 

**A-1028-02**; **175 x 50**, Inflate to **36** PSI, **250** KPa, **2.5** BAR

* Evolve's 7" inch AT tire image extracted from the video. You read on the tire's side:

**A-1028-02**; **175 x 50**, Inflate to **50** PSI, **350** KPa, **3.5** BAR

I'm still not seeing where it says 175 x 70. Is it supposed to be visible from the picture above? Weird it does say 36 PSI in the other photo. Ones I have here say 50.

Yeah, my bad. I thought I saw the measure :dizzy_face:... not clear in the vid image, but the rest is like yours: Inflate to **50** PSI, **350** KPa, **3.5** BAR

...still, different than the tires offered at their site. Strange

Maybe do some research before just randomly using stuff from the internet:
https://evolveforums.com/threads/135mm-wheels.415/

135mm are also not 6"
