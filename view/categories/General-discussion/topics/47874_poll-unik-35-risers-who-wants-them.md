**Note: This is not a group buy.**

I've been trying to get a hold of a pair of Unik's custom CNC milled aluminium 35° risers (to fit 35° trampa trucks on a topmount like the Jet Spud). They're featured on @okp's classic shortboard with offroad Trampa wheels which [you can see on youtube :star_struck:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAkpsMPtV5g). You can't see the risers (because they're on the underside of the board ... doh!) but they're there.

Here's what they look like from a picture uploaded by @longhairedboy (in the flesh colour circle ... oooh, flesh colouring! :+1:):

![20481739_107563703274930_4280555649202388992_n|667x500](upload://hzDBGRcQCbBEyHhZMk3ZURnbbnL.jpg)

Here's the problem with the risers ... they're expensive :grimacing: to manufacture. I contacted @okp and he mentioned that he needs a minimium of 10 pieces (5 pairs) but probably closer to 20 pieces (10 pairs) to make a production run worth while. I'm trying to raise interest to see if we can get 20 pieces (10 pairs). You should know I'm not making the risers, and I'm not affilliated with UNiK. I just want a pair of risers myself, and this is likely to be my best option. 

**Note: This is not a group buy.**

[The last time this topic was discussed](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/unik-35-risers-compatible-with-trampa-spring-trucks/31302/23?u=kane) the quoted prices were ...

1 riser : 125€ HT / 150$ HT
=> 250€ / 300$ for a dual

Shipping :
FR : 9€ /
US / AUS: 22€
UE : 15€

I'm going to assume that these prices are still the same but you should treat these numbers as indicative rather than final numbers. If you've read this far, and you'd interested :thinking: in getting UNiK 35° risers then [here's a google spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PZI51RbYEXgJDZtogYVcOELXRm-nY9gKqlS2nF5-a7c/edit?usp=sharing) where you an register your interest. Once we have 10+ pieces (5+ pairs) I'll pass all the information over to @okp and let him deal with directly with the individuals regarding payment and shipping.

Oh, and did I mention this is not a group buy?! :grinning:

edit: added emoji because emoji!

There's been a whole backchannel discussion around this topic ... and it's become clear that the words "Group Buy" mean something quick specific on this forum. From memory, the need to be Level 3 (before being able to create a group buy) was introduced after @alextech [acted like a douche ... another runner in the night](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/horrible-communication-by-alextech/25597). A bunch of people got burnt and the rule was introduced.

On this forum (_and only on this forum_), the term "Group Buy" seems to involve (1) taking payment (2) purchasing the product, and (3) distributing the product.

_This post is none of these things._

This post is to see if there is sufficient interest to help justify a production run with @okp. If I can't raise sufficient interest for 5-10 pairs of the risers (which are really cool, btw; you should check them out) then this whole tread is moot. Having said all that, this controversy is really great for raising the visibility, so thanks for that! :grinning: :+1:

Let me point out a few specific points:

1. I'm not asking (nor will I be taking) anyones money. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy diving into a bath of crisp $100 bills as much as the next guy, but that's just not the intent here.
2. I'm not building the product. @okp is much better at that than I am, and I'm happy to let the master have all the glory.
3. I'm not sending nothing to nobody ... unless you want a picture of my dog. You can have that for free. He's a really cute dog.

i don't have a dog. I'd probably just kill it if it started yapping. 

i hate yapping. 

This is not a group buy. 

But it IS going to take a good 20 sets of these to get the run worth while, because they are ridiculous. The batch of 5 sets i bought was expensive as shit and i only needed one set for one build. I had the sell the rest and at the time there wasn't a whole lot of demand for them. 

based on the ridiculousness of angled risers, i expect baseplates to be equally ridiculous.

I understand. I'm not questioning the cost, and I know you have to make it worth your while. I'm more than happy to support that. :+1:

I'm just suprised there isn't more interest. As soon as I saw them, I wanted a pair (of risers) so the slow progress is killing me! :grin:

Thanks @kane!
Quick question, i'm getting these for an AT build on a 34" Potato deck. These angled risers fit all Trampa trucks i assume? I've not decided which trucks to get yet.

Might help you decide the kind of suspension to go with it. Trampa uses their springs while the MBS Matrix pro II's use their damper things(Sorry can't recall the exact name). 

MBS supposedly lighter than the Trampa but I don't know by how much. Checking the Lacroix posts you'll find a comparison and discussion as to why the decided on the MBS for the Lacoix DS660 custom completes.

Hope this helps!

I do want a set but $300 is steep. I understand there is cost associated with this so not discrediting the work. 

Maybe it would be cheaper to have these welded

I hear you, but you might want to consider there is a real possibility this is a one-and-only opportunity. When I first saw these risers I had the same reaction as you ... "they're just too expensive." So I put some money aside over about 3-4 months and when I was ready it was already too late; all the risers were already sold and there were none left. So I created this thread. It's been a PITA and I won't be doing it again, but the only reason why I'm still here is because of a very slim hope it might be successful. 

I've already thought about alternatives, and if this all falls throught I'm going be making my own design from a lump of metal and a blowtorch ... it's not gong to be pretty. :grimacing:

If you make this out of three steel or aluminum plates and then weld them together the cost would be much lower.  Top plate, bottom plate, center plate.  Design for pieces to be fit together then welded. Cutting could be done on a waterjet or plasma. Maybe add a couple ribs for added strength. Make sure you get a competent welder

thanks for the feedback. I'm going to investigate this. I usually get everything milled out of solid block of AL7075 and get a nice anodized finish. That's what I have started when making my parts available without compromising strength and quality. 

By looking at how the ESK8 scene has evolved in the last 4 years, I also think that  price can also be a perception. I'm a huge supporter of helping people to build better boards at the right level of price so ESK8 is available to more and more people but on the other side, these risers will last forever, can be sold while still keeping their original value whereas some other parts that cost a lot of money too (wheels) will get old over time.

Builders usually don't care "that much" about price but a lot more about fairness and balance knowing that here, the main driver would be price... and if we can manage to get more people into this existing initiative, everyone will benefit of this at the end (and the price will be lower)

I personally am put off from these just because of how prohibitive the cost is. I imagine I could get one of these machined by a friend.

I'm gonna take a stab at redesigning how they're built, in an attempt to make a cheaper design. I don't expect it to ever be built but I figure it's a little relevant given all the price discussion.
