Hi everyone from Italy!
I’m planning to build my first electric skateboard. At the moment I’m thinking of having a single motor and a 10s configuration. I’m mostly **interested in range, rather than speed**, so my idea is to program the VESC in order to limit the top speed to **30km/h** (at least for now). 

ALREADY PURCHASED:
-	**The longboard**: deck, Caliber II 50° trucks, 83mm flywheel clones etc. (around 150 euro)
-	**Motor pulley (15t), wheel pulley (36t) and 15mm belt** from Ebay (around 25 euro)
-	**A FOCBOX** (from the Europe group buy): which I plan to use in FOC mode (126 euro)

STILL HAVE TO PURCHASE: 
-	**2x5s 5000mah 25C Lipo batteries** to connect in series: this way I should get around 18 km out of them. (80 euro)
-	**Turnigy Aerodrive SK3 - 6374-192kv** (78 euro): or is it better to have the 6364 model if I don’t want to go too fast?
-	**Hobbyking motor mount** (8 euro)
-	A Lipo charger: **IMAX B6 DC Copy** (15 euro)
-	**Cables**: I still have not figured out which cables I need to buy to connect the batteries in series and to the VESC (which uses a XT60 connector). Also I have not quite understood how to make the antispark switch.
-	**An enclosure**: I was planning to go cheap to start with. I’d like to have something that can be easily opened to easily charge the batteries.
-	**A remote**: it seems to me that the **Benchwheel** remote is currently one of the best ones and I really like the fact that it has a 50% throttle mode. Does anyone know where to find one without having to order it from china? Maybe someone who is selling his here in Europe? Would you suggest any other remote? Why?

I am planning to buy most of these components as soon as they are available on hobbyking (EU warehouse)

Plans for the future
-	Get a **BMS**
-	Get a **fancy enclosure** with a switch and charger port which are easy to reach

Now I ask you: what do you think about my setup? Will all parts go well together? Does it make sense for me to get these components if I prefer range over speed? Is there any way I can save a few euros?

Thank you in advance for your answers :grin:

i wouldnt go hobby king motor mount you will find a better mount on these forums.. you might need risers to avoid hardware touching your deck.. 6374 is nice.. im using a 6355 and its got plenty of power.. i have had 2 benchweel remotes, cant say i care for them, the v2 winning is ok, i got a couple of v2 and v1.. they are decent.. if i were you id get a really nice remote maybe alien remote or somefin, QC is an issue with these chinese remotes, im still troubleshooting my last crash.. FOCBOX should be schweeet.! 10S is easier to run I hear.. for range some other memebers will be more able to comment as I use 18650's and not lipos

I can buy a nicer motor mount if I get some more money. As for now, the budget is really tight.
How come you didn't like the benchwheel remotes? I've heard some people on the forum depicting them as the best they have had so far. What do you mean by QC?
I've bought a couple of 6 mm risers and a couple of 15-10mm angled risers. I think they should be enough

I'm about to purchase some components from hobbyking. I was wondering: should I get a 6364 190kv motor or a 6374 192kv one? What's the difference between them? Is the 6374 worth the 7 euro difference?
