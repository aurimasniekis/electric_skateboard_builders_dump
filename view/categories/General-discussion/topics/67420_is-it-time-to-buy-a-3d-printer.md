The more I research this hobby the more I want a 3D printer.   Granted I've wanted one for several years and have also considered one of the kits.  You know the cheap ones from gear best that start fires.  I love the idea of building the printer, then using it to make parts to improve itself.  Figured I'd spend the day researching but from this community does anyone have a recommendation?  I'd like to stay under $300, however if that budget isnt worth it let me know.

you can get a great self assembly kit for under $300 these days. It will take a good few days to assemble, tweak and learn to print but that is also kind of fun.

Try and get a printer with a heated glass plate it will make life a lot easier.

recently picked up an Ender 3, loving it so far. it comes pretty much close to fully assembled. maybe about an hour of setup max. Gearbest / BG have it frequentyly for like 170 -180 but you gotta wait for it to ship, you can spend 40 more and get it from amazon in two days look for seller comgrow. Had a slight issue with a bowed bed, but creality replaced it pretty quickly.

Esk8 got me seriously considering a 3D printer as well and a CNC too but those are way more expensive

I think the Ender3  would print most of the things we usually use as I've been reading more into 3D printing as well but not sure about how well it prints other filaments like Nylon

I got an anet a8 for my classroom and got some upgrades for it. 
Auto Levelling Anet A8 with Included Filament - Prusa i3 DIY 3D Printer w/Self Levelling Sensor https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07237ZYGK/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_EM9KBbENB6DCD

All for under 300. You can google upgrades for this printer and find everything. It takes time but worth it.

Yes the Anet A8 printer is great printer after upgrades and it's under your budget. There are also many videos reviewing it and recommending what needs to be upgraded.

Would recommend the creality platforms over the a8, they are much more rigid and not much more expensive. Ebay occasionally has 15 or 20 percent off coupons, bought an ender 3 for 160 shipped with one of those, delivered from a US warehouse

I just checked out some of the suggestions made here, prices have dropped and quality has upped massively in the year since I got mine. I am tempted to get a second one at these prices, especially as most seem to come pre-assembled now.

BTW, I'd say that it's only worth it for buy a printer if you plan on designing your own parts to print. Most doo-dads on thingiverse are useless, poorly designed, or don't work etc. It's also just not that much fun to download and print.

Exactly what @Octave suggested;

“Anet A8” = $150
I consider this a workhorse.  It was first printer i bought (3yrs ago) and is still rockin it.

“Cr-10”
Simplicity of design makes it a great starter printer.  

VERY note worthy...

“MPCNC”  = can print parts yourself or order.
Best multi-purpose machine seen yet for the cost and time to setup/calibrate.  Can make work area any size you want.  You can attach pretty much any kind of tool head;
•spindle
•dremel 
•rotozip
•3D printer
•drag knife
•Palm sanders
•Rotary sanders
•Pens/Markers

...most listed items already have mounts made and can found on Thingiverse

There are plenty of good designs on thingiverse as well as bad ones.  You have to remember that people that post there designs made it to their specific needs.  It may not be exactly what you want but thats why you edit the design  to your own  needs.

If you design your own objects, depending on experience, chances are your gonna have to edit it after your first print anyways.

this might help with that...(STL_to_CAD) NOTE: doesn't always work out well.

I disagree. I have a 300x300x400 printer, and rearly find myself using the full build volume. In terms of print quality a smaller print bed will outperform the larger one if all the other components are the same. So if you dont see yourself using the full build volume anytime, i would have gone with the ender 3 vs cr-10.

Thats another point stl files are hopeless for reediting, esp complex models. RAW cad formats would be much more useful. But hardly anyone shares these. I think thingiverse is a great idea, its just proved useless for me.

If I was looking to buy a 3D printer at the moment I would go for Prusa i3 MK3. I know it's a little expensive but it's such a nice printer with very cool features and great support from both Prusa and community.

On a tight budget the Creality Ender 3 is a very good option. Best that you could hope for around 200 bucks.

If you want a printer with bigger build volume then go for either Jgaurora A5, CR-10 or Tevo Tornado. All have their pros and cons, cost around $300 and are similarly sized. Watch some reviews and decide what features you prefer. A few notes about the Tevo Tornado: it's very similar to CR-10 but has much better heated bed. And that matters a lot especially when the bed is so big. But with the Tornado you definitely need 8-diode [smoothers](http://makerfun3d.com/tevo-tornado-8-diode-smoother).

I've seen and used quite a few printers. I went the route of designing and making the printer myself. Wouldn't recommend that unless you really, really like that kind of stuff :sweat_smile: My goal was to save some money and you know how that works with DIY stuff...

Here's a crappy pic of it from some time ago when it was almost ready from it's second rebuild/design. Now it's a bit different looking with nice LEDs but don't have a photo :confused:

![20180304_141158|374x500](upload://dmZmCpyGFX8ZTXdqNKVo4oplDr.jpg)

By the way, authentic E3D products (like E3D Volcano hotend) are the best upgrades I could ever recommend to any 3D printer. Also TMC2100 drivers are very nice on a Ramps/Arduino Mega based controller.

you can always buy and add a glas sheet in the end to clamp on your heated bed. if you have glass cutting buisness near you its probably just a few bucks. tough amazon has nice support and fast shipping (if its not 3rd party chinese seller).

Yeah I do like the warranty and support via amazon. The price is about $250 already though.

Are you able to reliably print nylon or abs on it? I know pla is common but wanted the durability of the harder filaments for remotes. Kinda busted ip my current remote which does work but having a tough material that lasts longer is what I’m looking for

no you will need a heated chamber for those plastics, everything other than pla and petg will be a pita without.

Ok good to know thanks! I reckon there are mods that allow heated chambers to be swapped in for the ender 3? I think @agniusm prints his n.e.s.e. Modules in petg on the ender 3 but i could be mistaken on that
```

## \#35 Posted by: Nordle Posted at: 2018-09-09T04:35:15.615Z Reads: 156

petg and pla are fine without. but you can do already a lot with these two. petg is similar to abs just less warping and a bit more brittle (and more stringing...).
but for example i printed axle clamps on my mtb in petg, and they are still holding up.
petg is ideal for the nese modules i think, very high heat resistence (for a 3d print at least)

building a enclosure should always possible for any printer.

if you didn’t already, download slic3er or ideamaker(found recently and very like it) and try them out. it’s all you need for printing software wise;)

one last thing, personally i would buy the cheaper one from gearbest

Ender 3 is a nice printer. like others suggested you need a closed chamber for abs otherwise you will get a crappy result without it. Also you need to let it cool down on the bed otherwise it warps really bad :/ other than those gimmicks abs gives me better results in quality compared to pla.

For high temperature filaments such as nylon you really want to have an **all-metal hotend** that can safely reach +250°C and more! I'm quite sure the Ender3 doesn't come with one.

The layers didn’t stick nicely together even with 260 degrees.
I wanted to print pulleys and the details of the teeth where not so accurate like with petg.
I guess a problem was also the nylon itself.
Found out it was some kind of wet and I couldn’t dry it out as we have only a gas oven and I can’t regulate 50-60degree. So I guess if you get a better nylon it could work out somehow.

Nylon soaks water extremely well. U have to put it into a vacuum box immediately after unboxing or printing. Even better if u can manage it at the time u are printing with nylon. Also a chamber Temperatur up to 60 degrees is recommended

For an entry printer the general consensus on the Reddit 3dprinting forum is an Ender-3 or Anycubic i3 mega.

The important thing to do is get it calibrated both hardware and software wise.

Then start modding and read read read 

Just like esk8

Same as @Andy87 I have a Tevo, I like a 24v bed as a must, for high temp filaments it makes life easier.

I’ve replaced the x/y/z drivers with TMC2100 and using a DRV8825 for the extruder. 1mm PEI plate for adhesion.

Importantly I’ve tuned in the VREF of the drivers so as not to get the motors hot and miss steps, now enjoying silence.

Benchy making is required but also make calibration cubes and fine tune your steps, having a print come out dimensionally correct is really important for makers mg mechanical parts.

Right now I’m printing some z-brace mount to reduce z-banding using a big printed triangle and 8mm threaded rod, I’m also going to add more rollers for the Y-axis.

I’m going to change the cold-end to a water-cooled Chimera with a Petsfang blower with a 5015 fan.

After that a heated enclosure with 4mm polycarbonate with a lack table enclosure.

My Wanhao I’m rebuilding with flexion extruder for squishy filament primarily

i have a creality cr-10 on my desk and i love it. its over your budget but its worth it. i paid around 500€ around a year ago so it might be cheaper nowadays since the newer models hit the market already.

regardless what printer your going to buy...i suggest printers with a good rigid frame and a big print volume. the cr10 has a 30x30x40cm build volume which is nice.

Don't get too caught up upgrading. It's very easy to tumble down that hole. For the e3, print a filament guide and a fan guard. That's it. Run it for a while, print some parts for your board, and don't upgrade anything else until you have at least a dozen parts done. After that you'll start to get a sense for what's actually needed, and which upgrade parts are not utter crap.

I got 3 ender 3 for my upcoming 3d printer cluster. 12 planned. Having prusa and 1 built on cr10s4 frame I am modding my enders. I am near finished with most. These will up the price of a printer from 209usd to 320eur.
Here is the list:
1. Direct drive system with titan and v6 ( better quality eith less retraction, flexible filament printing, hight temp printing, mine, up to 350C)
2. Induction probe ( always smooth and nice first layer)
3. Spring steel magnetic print plate with N45H magnets ( for induction probe, to flex off prints, for future pick and place robot)
4. Extruder breakout (to swap faulty components on extruder without tracing all the way to mainboard(for production to minimize down times)
5. Filament runout sensor
6. Drag chains on x and y
7. MGW9 rails on x and y (less maintenance, better motion system than v slot wheels)
8. Firmware mod to enlarge print are from 220x220 to 232x228 ( cause Chinese cant make stuff perpendicular and all is crooked, hence cant go 235x235)

Don't do it.  There are major safety problems with that platform that the "upgrades" dont address, there are several accounts of this specific printer burning down due to the printer being fundamentally made out of a flammable material, coupled with the fact that rhe firmware thermal protections are disabled by the factory.  And even if you dont care about that, the frame is made out of floppy, sheet acrylic.  Even if you upgrade every other component of the printer, the frame is just too unstable to achieve the level of accuracy and precision that you want.

The Ender 3, despite being twice the price, is SIGNIFICANTLY better value because you get a much more rigid, extruded aluminum profile frame.  2 years ago the A8 made sense from a value perspective, if you were willing to do a lot of tinkering, but we've made a lot of progress since then.

For what it's worth here is my experience.  Printing PLA is fine but it's mostly only useful for orniments and things.  PETG is good but a sticky pita sometimes.  What you really want to be able to print in is Nylon and ABS - that for me really brings out the potential for 3d printing.

Look at these pulleys, 100% Nylon (I just finished them)

That is the sort of stuff you want to be able to do.

hacked a few ikea CL finds together with some scrap plexiglass to try and print ABS with the ender 3.

Check out this new video of PP filament. Really interesting properties, especially the layer adhesion seems amazing. Not for taking any forces though but good for applications which need to flex.

Things are escalating quickly over here. . .  A coworker didn't want to figure out / fix his Monoprice Maker Select Mini's, so he gave them to me to help build out my mini print farm.

Ender 3 is still the way to go if your are planning on buying a printer, but the MPSMs do a decent job, albeit at half the print volume. For the price of 'gratis', I'll take it.

I used to have that printer too!  ITs amazing that a year ago that was a fairly compelling option, and in the time since it has been not only totally eclipsed in quality by the Ender 3, but also undercut in price too.

MSo I picked this up on Amazon and have been extremely happy:

https://www.amazon.com/Creality-3D-CR-2020-Assembled-200x200x200mm/dp/B07D49S45M

The printer is extremely precise right out of the box and has auto leveling, heated bed. Printed this 3d cube puzzle and well the quality speaks for itself.

I am going to see if he is feeling generous and will let me do a few prints.

We have a FlashForge Dreamer and really like it. It can print in ABS but not nylon. I haven't used it for eskate projects. I am not sure I would trust 3D printed gears, for example. I am thinking of battery boxes, stuff like that. One website with many 3D models is Thingiverse. I would go see if there are things that you want to print before getting a printer.

I have a little filament printer that is awesome, haven't printed anything from thingiverse in a long time, it's all custom stuff. Having a 3D printer has been invaluable.

Haven't had any issues with ABS gears that I've printed, although they are really only for testing and will be replaced with either metal or a harder plastic in the long run.

I am really curious to see how SLA performs in terms of speed, accuracy and durability though

My first post! 

Getting a 3d printer changed my life, I highly recommend getting one. The sweet spot seems to be around $600. That's taking into account speed, print quality, exotic Filament capabilities. I would recommend a kit over a complete build so you intimately understand how each piece supports the other and so on. in most cases it saves you some money too. It's not an easy hobby though, be ready to spend some time learning the software.

Ok here is an XT90 handle / over mold designed by @mmaner  look at this printers precision. I know there are a lot of great printers in the market I have just been so pleased with this one.  I have no connection to Creality and purchased my printer from Amazon.  I did a lot of study and this is just the one I pulled the trigger on as I wanted something that worked out of the box....

Used a bit of two part JB weld epoxy and all done solid less than 2hr from beginning to end.

Yes this is why you want a good 3D printer.

I purchased an ender 3(shipped for $200) and am very happy with it "now". It took me about 10 days(spending roughly 2 hours on it every day) to learn about the slicing software(I am using cura), experiment with the setting, print calibration prints  and align the hardware and print setting based on that. It's good hardware once you set it up, but you should be ready to loosen a few bolts and adjust a few things to get it to print perfectly.

This little @mmaner 3D part just makes life easier....the plug goes in and comes out the same but with the thicker grip it is just much nicer worth the time to print have made two as it is just fun putting these together.

Now here is what I would personally pick:

Ender 4 (without Duetwifi) £258
Ender 4 (without Duetwifi) £258
Prusa Mk3 £699
Hypercube Evolution ~£600

**Total: £1’815.00**

Here is what I would pick if I was to need larger build volumes:

Anycubic Chiron £320 (Unofficial duetwifi £144)
Anycubic Chiron £320 (Unofficial duetwifi £144)
Hypercube Evolution £800 (Upgraded for larger build area and Official duet wifi)

**Total: £1’872.00**  - Leaves some spare cash for possible upgrades for the Chiron that I personally don’t know about (As I haven’t personally used one yet)

Here is what I would pick if I wanted quality over quantity :

Ender 4 (without Duetwifi) £258
Ender 4 (without Duetwifi) £258 (or replace the two Ender 4’s with a single one and all the QoI upgrades)
Prusa Mk3 / Hypercube Evolution £700
Prusa Mk3 / Hypercube Evolution £700

**Total: £1’914.00**

Plus obviously there is the choice of having 8, ender 4’s instead ( or 6 Chiron’s). which would definitely be a small print farm!

I've been torn between the ender 3 and this sparkmaker resin printer - more costly to print but apparently fairly reliable with a couple of minor mods, I will probably get the ender but since its second use case would be printing little figures for my nephew its hard to ignore the res on this.
