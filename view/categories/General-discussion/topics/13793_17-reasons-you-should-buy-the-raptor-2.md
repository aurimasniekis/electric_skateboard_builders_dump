**1. The Raptor 2 is Most Powerful Direct Drive Electric Skateboard. Bigger battery, more current.** 


 - "Inboard" they only have a 99wh battery & smaller motors || Raptor 2 wins on battery alone. Not to mention top speed etc & over triple the battery size.

 - "CARVON EMCX" Single hub motor only, 99wh battery || Raptor 2 wins on battery & has dual hub motors PLUS VESCX which can throughput much higher current.

 - "Acton Quatro" 4HUBS, 240Wh battery, only 1600Watt || Raptor 2 has Bigger battery & higher wattage with peak of 3.3KW

 - "Mellow" Only have 99wh battery, maybe 2300watts max power (not sure 100%, not much info) || Raptor 2 has bigger battery & higher wattage & higher top speed.



**2. More torque delivered to the wheels as there is no belts which create a bottleneck & there is zero maintenance**

the wheels look like they would be a hard durometer, would it be possible to change them out for a set of orangotang kegels?
