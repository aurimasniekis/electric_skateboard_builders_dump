Hello. New here. I'm planning my first build and I'm wondering what speed is too much for you? I have a background in downhill so I know how speed feels but that was years ago, didn't have gsp speedometers then, and no brakes. I'm thinking about 30 it gets a but scary. I want my board to be able to cruise at the speed I want (commute), and maybe cross that fear boundary just a touch.

about the time you get a wobble... awesome until then...

joking aside, i typicaly gear for 25.  I've hit 30 on a 25 mph setup (tailwind or slight slope).

have you checked out any of the speed calculators?  There are quite a few with similar results - giving you a Wheel, Battery, Motor KV, motor gear / wheel gear setup for a given top speed.

Somewhere above 20mph depending on the road and your set up is where things get critical ... IMO ... It really depends......but comfortable riding is 15-20mph ...if you constantly above 20mph a full face is recommended....

And something about being over 20mph...seems your skin has a harder time slowing you down ðŸ˜‰

Yeah I've figured out how to calculate but I'm trying to make the decision of what speed I want to go. I will be going with a full helmet. some pads for when I feel like pushing it. I just want the ability to push it and still have a good efficient cruise most of the time. I'm going to buy 16t and the 13t pulleys for the ability to alter my top speed. My town has a 22 mile long smooth bike highway that connects 4 small towns and has off ramps at major roads. So excited!

What I was gunna say.  Brakes are everything. I wouldn't go on a board down a hill over 20 without them.  With brakes and a stiff board and wide trucks im not scared at 35 but exhilarated
I went down at 28mph 2 weeks ago.  Not so bad.

See that's my feeling too. I have this scooter I'm selling get to fund my build. It was so fast feeling at firs, topping out at 45. But a few months in and I'm bored and being tailgated constantly. Speed and range (and building custom shit is awesome) are why I'm here instead of staring at the boosted board blog waiting for shipping updates

 45mph on a board I'm sure you won't be bored.  I used to have a scooter 50cc and I could just get it to 50 with a slight downhill.  35mph on a board seems enough to me

dude, a scooter or bicycle or motorcycle is completely different than a piece of wood with tiny urethane wheels under your feet.  Going 20 mph to me on a board is a lot more thrilling/dangerous than going 40 mph on my road bicycle downhill.  

I've gone over 30 mph on a board, and it's pretty damn scary.  I wear full face helmet and pads everywhere under my shirt...and I do even have a moto GP armored race suit.  

The SCARIEST thing ever is anytime you lose your brakes or connection with the remote or you get the slightest hint of speed wobbles...that will make your heart skip a few beats.

If you have downhill experience, it's still different on an E-board.  First pulling off a slide to stop a regular longboard from 20 + mph while bombing hills is terrifying and no matter how many times you do it, you still are scared to do it.  On an e-board, if you lose brakes or connection...you cannot pull off a slide, they are too heavy and the wheels are too soft.  You're screwed if you lose brakes, even if you have experience...unless you're zak maytum and can footbrake at 60 mph like below.  (at 1:04)

I shouldn't have brought the scooter into it haha. I agree and know from experience that a board is way different. My point was that I quickly grew out of that vehicle capabilities. I don't plan on making anything that can go over 30-32 mph. Probably more like 28 max.

I know speed wobble intimately haha. I've taken high speed falls and lost skin. Ive seen first hand some near-deadly falls. I can foot break and with hand protection, could probably still pull an emergency slide to stop. I just want to get a feel for how others experience speed on an Eboard And Your Input helps. 

I am very curious to hear about remote failure, motor failure or anything that could cause the board to stop suddenly beneath you. I hadn't thought of that. Do you just lose power and coast against belt resistance or can it seize? I've seen drones lose signal and just sit there flying. Does the Vesc have safety features that shut it down smoothly or could it go full throttle without your consent?

You can set the specific amps you want going to brakes when signal is lost. I've only guessed at the appropriate amount...think I used .5. 
Most electronic failures result in dead/coasting board which isn't terrible so long as you're not headed down a big ass hill or going 20+ mph into a busy intersection. Occasionally electronic failures result in brakes locking up...happened to me, but it was the result of the VESC and motor short it at the same time, which I have to believe is rare. I've since insulated the hell out of my motor wires to prevent it from happening again.

I think that is scary, but definitely not the SCARIEST. The scariest is when you lost your remote connection and the board is pushing full throttle because of a failure and not just let you roll out. That happens to me at 32mph and because it was a test run I was only wearing a helmet and no protectors. Haven't drive since that again.

My opinion is, that everything below 20mph feels comfortable, everything below 30mph is fun when no error occurs.

He is crazy, but very skilled.  Helmet and gloves he has, but I don't see pads.  There is a video of him posted by venom bushings where he does 70 mph downhill.

At these speeds on a longboard you won't make it out of a crash without broken bones, skin and muscles shaved off down to bones.  He is really fearless.  I put on a moto go armored suit when doing around 35 mph and it's still scary.

@Photorph wow that is insane I didn't think footbraking was possible at those speeds. No matter how skilled someone is, I still think it's insane to do runs like that without full gear. If a stone in the road shows up unexpectedly, it'll mean 6 months in the hospital if you're lucky!

@Spek I agree with @Michaelinvegas that up to 20ish MPH is comfortable. I ride on medium-traffic suburban streets. I hit 22 MPH six times a week, and I've adapted my setup to be stable at and up to that speed while still being carvy enough to be fun at slower speeds. Most of my riding time is at 12-15 MPH as I negotiate over many different terrains, sidewalks, and intersections. I wear an open-faced helmet w elbow and kneepads. My daily build is geared for 28MPH and I use ERPM in VESC to cap speed at around 22 MPH.

TLDR: Up to 22MPH feels fun and manageable with regular safety gear and beyond that the scales tip to being too dangerous for me to enjoy it. The environment you ride in plays a huge role here; if you have smooth paved trails with no cars I'm sure that higher speeds becomes more fun.

For me, I feel safer at high speeds. Some of the roads I commute on at in perfect condition and cars pass like crazy. If I can do 35 mph, I would be able to keep up with them. At 25 mph, they still pass. It all depends on your setup really. If you use wide trucks, and have a wide wheel base, you feel more stable at high speeds.

From this thread I've taken a few things away for my first build. I will be starting with a gear ratio that produces a slower top speed, giving myself the option to easily switch a gear and take that up a bit, if I want to. Secondly, I can program the ESC to keep things a little below their maximum capabilities. I sure this has the added bonus of keeping the stress on parts down. 

I've also developed a new fear and worry over remote failure. Being trapped on a board that has decided to go full throttle against your will sounds like a pretty terrible worst case scenario.

YES!!!! uphill seems so less scary than downhill. I swear I don't go faster than 15 mph downhills in case my remote fails (which has never happened luckily). Uphill or flat though, bring on the speed :P

I think this is a good strategy @Spek - it also has the added benefit of producing more torque for good acceleration and hill-climbing. 

I'm always disappointed when "top speed" is used as measure of how desirable an esk8 is. I think people want to hear that a board is "the best and fastest," not realizing that top speed is only useful if it can be safely applied in the right environment. It's rare that someone has the combination of skill and environment to safely ride at 30MPH+ Not hating on those that do it, just recognizing that the potential for serious, life-altering injury increases greatly at those speeds and they should be taken seriously.

@Spek get yourself a Flysky GT2B (with an enclosure mod if you like) and you'll eliminate almost all risk of controller dropout. It's the bluetooth and nunchuk users that have these issues generally. Although, we should always ride with the recognition that a board failure could happen.

From my research I agree.  But I have one caveat.  If you use a VESC, be sure that your downhill use of brake isn't long enough to stress the VESC or battery regen.  My first real test hit the regen/voltage cutoff about 2/3 down a hill.  Of course it had a stop sign at the bottom.  Fortunately I was able to ride it out okay.  That gave me a healthy dose of fear with my VESC settings... :grimacing:  Of course, she still calls me back.... :smiling_imp:

long consistent, but light, braking force down hill is how I get a nice amount of charge back from my rides. Never overheated my components. Boosted recommends longer braking sessions for better regen as well, but they use a different ESC so it may vary.

For the most reliable connection i still feel the GT2b is the best.  Not always the smallest and takes some fiddling to make it pocketable (badwolf, mad monkey, baby buffalo, master cho - enclosures for it).  A fun project and rock solid regardless of interference (that i've found at least).

I share your sentiments. I really like the idea of board brake or brake board or any of those external braking solutions (the ones with disc brakes and/or the ones with the road brake, not the ones where they want you to just carve into your wheels, which is poor design IMO). 

I keep toying around with the idea of putting a "brake button" on my board like the opposite of lowguido's perpetual steez button. I am just getting into this though and learning how to manipulate the vesc. I like the idea of not having a remote at all.

While still on the brake button idea.. I think this could also work nicely for not so good esc's.. like the car ones :D

There just needs to be some sort of specific resistance to each button (if there are more than one) which act as different levels of signal..

ok i sound maybe a bit blurred.. but im still sketching out on how it might work and it just connected with what you said about ''brake button''

Maybe not a button, a pressure plate perhaps? Maybe something like a guitar wah pedal? Lol. I liked the idea of the zboard, but not the price tag. https://www.zboardshop.com/products/zboard-2-blue

I want to get my hands (feet?) on some of those footpads. Now that I think about it, that's exactly what I want, with cruise control. Also, some type of e-brake when I'm flying down a hill in case something shorts out.
