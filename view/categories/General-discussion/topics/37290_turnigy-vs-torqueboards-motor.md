Neither.

Go with: 

https://miamielectricboards.com/shop-1/unsensored-electric-motor

It's waterproofed and sensored. I think it's actually a new generation Maytech that is rebranded.

Same as the one on eskating.eu but for a much better price and especially for US customers...

Keep in mind that TB's motors come with a keyway and flat spots on the shaft for grub screws.

Yes, so turnigy should not have like an anchor point for the motor polley?

I have a turnigy motor and torque boards. I say go with torque bards, its sensored, and having a keyway will really come in handle when mounting a pulley, particularly with a 6355 motor, it will put a lot of strain on grub screws, and that's after you file down the shaft of the turnigy motor which is a bit of a pain.
