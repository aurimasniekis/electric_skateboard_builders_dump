# UPDATED Putting California&rsquo;s Electric Skateboard Law to the test. Can it get me out of a ticket?

Last Friday, I got a ticket for riding in the bike lane. In Los Angeles, California, where the law clearly states you can legally ride an electric skateboard in the bike lane. 

I tried to show the officer that the board was electric and pulled up the law on my phone for him to read. He refused to even talk to me about it, only saying over and over that I needed to give him my license so he could write me a ticket. Eventually I just gave up and he wrote me the ticket. 

Now I'm going to challenge the ticket in court, but I'm worried that if the officer doesn't even know the law, will the court even bother to read it or will they up-hold the ticket, basically making the law that lets us ride here in CA meaningless? 

Anyone have any advice for going to court and getting them to remove the ticket?

Here is the law for reference. http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?lawCode=VEH&division=11.&title=&part=&chapter=1.&article=7.

When you go to court show the law to the judge and it will get dismissed.

Looks pretty bullet proof. I need to put reflective tape on my helmet though, to be 100% in compliance.

That's good to hear. Should I bring my board as proof that it is electric and meets the standards set fourth by the law? I'm worried the officer will claim it is just a normal skateboard and the the judge will take his words over mine.

You can bring it with you or take some photos of it. Dont know if you can bring it into the court room or not.

I'd bring it. Just in case. Although depending on the court, you may have trouble with security. Our local courthouse has metal detectors and a security staff with no sense of humor.

Also sometimes depending on how your court deals with tickets you can fill out a form and dispute the ticket without going to court. Maybe try calling the court house and see what they say your options are.

I don't live in Cali.  But if I tried to bring an electric skateboard into a courtroom over here, well, it would not end pretty.  
  
Take photographs of your board.  If ti goes to trial, call the cop onto the witness stand before he gets any wind of the law and ask him if this picture looks like the skateboard he saw you riding.  If he says "yes", you have a pretty bulletproof not-guilty by just reading the law after that.  
  
If he lies, which cops do ALL THE TIME then you're just fucked and you're going to pay for his small-penis-syndrome.

I'd recommend asking the officer to describe what the board looked like, then show them them the pictures. Also if you have any other proof of you going for that ride and that you where using that board.

Quote the law when filling out the paperwork for dispute. It will likely be dropped without going to court. Happens quite often when mistakes are made, as it's not that cop him/herself that reads the dispute. It's a person that will actually look into the law, realise that there's no photos or accurate description of the board to argue it wasn't electric.
Otherwise if it goes to court, quote the law to the judge and that you were riding an electric board, have photos of the board in case the Judge would like to see them, but without the cop having pictures of what is clearly not an eboard you'll win the case hands down.

Take a look at the back of your ticket and see if they allow you to fight a ticket by “written declaration.” If so, google that term and look at the process. You are basically pitching your argument to a judge in writing. The officer will have an opportunity to present evidence in writing as well. Here’s the interesting part though, at the end of your declaration, you write something along the lines of “if I am found guilty of this violation, I request a court date to defend this in person.” It basically gives you 2 chances to get out of it. Also, cops are paid overtime to show up in person for court (so they rarely skip that), BUT they have to complete the documentation for a written declaration during their normal work hours. Many cops don’t want to bother with it. If the cop doesn’t write to the court,you get off...even if your defense was simply “I’m not guilty.” If he does write, and the judge agrees with the cops assessment, you still get your day in court. This is usually an option for all moving violations which it sounds like is the way he wrote it.

I hope all goes well. I keep a printed copy of the law in my backpack whenever I ride. I've only been stopped once by an officer. I wasn't wearing a helmet at the time.:open_mouth: He stated the law and asked me about the board a little then let me go. He was pretty cool about it. I think he was just waiting for the opportunity to use his new found knowledge.

This was in Westwood, about a block from the UCLA campus. I've passed by cops as well, and every single one of them has told me to get off the street, but none of them have given me a ticket until this guy. Most are pretty cool about it once I show them the law and explain. Not this guy though. He wouldn't even discuss it with me or listen when I tried to show him the law.

To be legally riding your board in LA you need to wear a helmet and not exceed 20mph. So set a limit on your vesc to top at 20mph if you want to take your board to the court.

lol, I try to be respectful, and not piss people off or be rude, but when I see an open path... :stuck_out_tongue:

Honestly, SF is really chill. We don't have nearly enough cops for a city this size, so they just focus on the real crimes, especially gangs and guns.

Even when weed was illegal, you could smoke in front of them on the street and they wouldn't care.

Maybe certain parts of downtown, they could care about electric skateboards. But where I live is super peaceful, happy, low crime residential neighborhood. Still packed full of people like a city, but a bit more chill then the downtown environment. In the oddity I see a cop, they are either in different, or excited (get a lot of thumbs up and smiles). I think especially when you suit up with leathers and a full face helmet, they respect you a bit more. Your showing them you take safety seriously.

I wasn't planning on taking my board to the court, as others have said, I doubt they'd let me in the courtroom. Lucky for me, the officer noted that I was stationary on my speed, as I was waiting for the light to change. I was not wearing a helmet, but I'm hoping that won't come up in court, and besides, the ticket was riding in the street, not for failure to wear a helmet.

I definitely wouldn't have handed him my driver's license, you didn't commit any offence let alone a driving offence.

I totally agree with you about the cops being on a power trip, trouble is giving false details could land you with a perverting the course of justice charge. Just tell em to jog on - unless they are going to arrest you don't provide details, this is your right, why be lured into a potentially more serious charge...

Yeah I believe here you do have to provide identification when you're stopped like that cause you are considered a vechicle if you're riding in the bike lane. I felt like the best thing to do was comply because seeing how this cop was obviously a jerk, I was afraid he might try to confiscate my board and I didn't want to have to go through the trouble of getting it back.  

I believe this was technically a public road, right on the edge of a public campus.

Everyone breaks laws every day.  Get used to it LoLz.  It's how a huge bureaucracy works.  It's all selective enforcement, so just don't make the cop angry and cater to their badassness-factor and you'll be better off.  Make the cop feel like a big badass and be really sorry and willing to change.  Even if you aren't breaking the law, they can just say you were anyway.  It's all about the cop, really.

In the US, you are required to properly identify yourself.  Giving a false name is a misdemeanor 

> _Penal Code 148.9. (a) **Any person who falsely represents or identifies himself or herself as another person or as a fictitious person to any peace officer** listed in Section 830.1 or 830.2, or subdivision (a) of_ _Section 830.33, upon a lawful detention or arrest of the person, either to evade the process of the court, or to evade the proper identification of the person by the investigating officer **is guilty of a misdemeanor**. (b) Any person who falsely represents or identifies himself or herself as another person or as a fictitious person to any other peace officer defined in Chapter 4.5 (commencing with Section__830) of Title 3 of Part 2, upon lawful detention or arrest of the person, either to evade the process of the court, or to evade the proper identification of the person by the arresting officer is guilty of a misdemeanor if (1) the false information is given while the peace officer is engaged in the performance of his or her duties as a peace officer and (2) the person providing the false information knows or should have known that the person receiving the information is a peace officer. _officer.

Ok, it's obviously not good to give false details, I'm not saying I'd still do that at my ripe old age (probably would!), but what if this guy didn't drive? How's he supposed to hand over his license? This cop didn't know if he drove or not, he didn't have to give him his driver's licence, riding esk8 is nothing to do with driving, there's no licence that covers it.

In the UK, handing over your licence when you're pulled is an admission of guilt, you don't have to do it, you can either refuse or say you don't have it on your person.

Well if I hadn't handed him my license he still would have asked for my name. And then he would have used that to look up my license. If I refused to give my name I would have likely been arrested. 
Once I realized there was no talking to this guy, I figured I'd rather get out of the encounter with a $194 ticket (I finally figured out how much the ticket costs) than risk him confiscating my board and having to go through a bunch of crap to get it back

You don't need a driver's license if you aren't driving.    But California appears to be more strict

> Although most American adults carry their driver's license at all times when they are outside their homes, there is typically no legal requirement that they must be carrying their license when not operating a vehicle. However, the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that states are permitted to require people to truthfully state their name when a police officer asks them; about half of the states have enacted some variant of stop and identify statutes requiring compliance with such police inquiries. Furthermore, **in some states, like California, failure to produce an identification document upon citation for any traffic infraction (such as riding a bicycle on the wrong side of a street) is sufficient justification for full custodial arrest.**

(I was curious so I googled it....)

That's specifically **NOT** what the law you quoted says.  It says

In the US, you are required to properly identify yourself after being arrested.  Giving a false name after arrest is a misdemeanor

See the subtle but *very important* difference?  So, after they arrest you and bring you downtown to the station, *then* it's a crime to give them a *false* name but that law does not say it's a crime to decline to give them a name.  It also says nothing about before you've been arrested.

Read the penal code again. It says, "upon a lawful detention or arrest of the person, either to evade the process of the court, or to evade the proper identification of the person by the investigating officer is guilty of a misdemeanor."  He was being lawfully detained.  Also California requires ID or they can just arrest you

Not trying to argue here.  I'm an engineer, not a lawyer.   I do know this... If you don't give them your name, they're going to get annoyed. And it's going to make things take way longer than it needs to

From wikipedia, again:

> in some states, like California, failure to produce an identification document upon citation for any traffic infraction (such as riding a bicycle on the wrong side of a street) is sufficient justification for full custodial arrest.

Wtf? How is handing over your license an admission of guilt? That's insane. And if you say you don't have it on your person, surely you'd be forced to get out of the vehicle and not drive it any further? It's 100% illegal to drive without having your licence with you in Australia... is that not the case in the UK?

Nope! You don't have to carry it on your person or have it in your vehicle at all.
You can be cited to produce it at a police station within 7 days though, which is what will generally happen if you don't have it at the time.

If you've been stopped for a traffic offence, by surrendering your license to the cop you're acknowledging you've done something wrong. You don't have to, you will still have to produce it at a station though at a later date, which isn't an admission of guilt.

Wow that sounds totally insane to me. How are the police supposed to do their job if they can't identify you?? In Australia _every_ time you're stopped for whatever reason (RBT etc.) you'll be asked to show your licence. It's standard practice to have your licence ready to present before the officer even reaches the window. If you can't present your licence you'll be asked to step out of the vehicle because it's illegal to drive without it.

It's not a legal requirement to carry identification on your person at all times in the UK.

Thing is, if it's a traffic offence, if you don't give your real name they can look up who the vehicle's owner is, whether or not it has insurance and if that person (false name you gave) is logged to be able to drive it etc. There's ways of them finding out. If none of that's covered, they may choose to arrest you.

But for something like this! I'd have totally given a false name, taken the ticket, put it in my back pocket and been on my way, tossing the ticket in the nearest trash can I could find.... :thumbsup:

Drivers licenses are still vastly different in the U.K than in USA?

Like this:

It's a huge piece of folded up pink paper.
No photo.
Expires on 70th birthday.
Any infractions (tickets) you've got are written directly on the license.

I believed it to be so if pulled over for a traffic violation, the officer can immediately see your status.



1986...I was living in England with my grans, took the driving test and got my license. 

I still have it, expires in 2035 lol.

Wow the rules in the U.K. seem so relaxed!

I'm in California, the law is/was that I have to have my driver's license on me if the police pulls me over driving. I CANNOT use a photocopy or picture of one (I used to keep a copy in my car just in case I don't have my wallet, which happened a lot back in college when I went to a gym or played sports). The cop will use the copy to pull up information on this computer to verify identity, but on top of the traffic ticket gives, I would get ANOTHER ticket for driving without a "valid" license. This was what the cop told me back in early 2000's not sure if the law has changed.

What would the cop have done then? He truly couldn't have handed over his drivers license because he didn't have one.

Like I said, unless you were driving a motor vehicle, there's absolutely no way you should hand over your drivers license.

ahhh you are not from the US, "Driver's License" is our adult identification card, we don't carry or even own both a DL and an ID. As a kid I carried only my school ID, but you can get a government ID, once you get a DL you only have that. So, cops saying "show my your DL is basically saying show me your ID."

more hilarious, ID cards are issued by the DMV....the Department of MOTOR Vehicles 
"**_DMV issues ID cards to persons of any age. The ID card looks like a driver license, but is used for identification purposes only_**"

Yes if you live in Cali and you are not driving you are not obligated to have an ID on you but guess what. IF / HOWEVER, once the police have a reason to stop a person they can demand identification and legally hold someone for a reasonable amount of time to determine their identification. If you are stopped lawfully and you do not have a license, the police have several actions they can choose from. These range from taking a thumb print at the scene to finally arresting someone and hold them at the police station pending positive identification.

The moral is, you can save yourself a lot of hassle by just carrying ID. While it is noted required, you also do not have the legal right to refuse to identify yourself under certain circumstances.

I think you are not understanding me. In order for an officer to write you a ticket they need to positively identify you. So you can either show them your ID or they can take you to the police station where they will try to ID you. Why would you not show them your ID and move on with your life? I believe every state has there own Identification card for people who dont drive or cannot legally obtain a drivers license.

It's a citation which will either be a fine or a court date with a judge that will result in a dismissal or a fine, like jaywalking...still a ticket. It's mostly up to the individual officer on what to do. But if you have no identification, they can take you in and hold you until they can positively identify you

The point is, if I hadn't given him my ID, he would have taken me into the police station until they figured out who I was. It's not as if they'll just take your word that the name you give them is your actual name, they want proof so that you can't just "throw away" the ticket after. And they certainly won't say, "oh he doesn't have ID, guess I can't write him a ticket then"

One time when I was about 13 or 14, some dickhead neighbor of ours called the cops, saying they saw someone breaking into our house ( complete lie ). Cops came and I opened the door. Luckily, the cops were really nice but they immediately asked for ID and I happened to have one ( got one when I was 11 ). If I hadn't had any, I don't know what would've happened but I'm guessing they would've asked to contact my parents and have them come and confirm everything.

And yes, this was in Cali. Even if it's not really necessary, it's always a good idea to carry ID...

To the original poster, if you do end up having to fight the ticket in traffic court, most judges will listen to you and try to uphold your rights.

Yeah, they’re kind enough to hold my money during the entire trial and then drag their feet getting it back to me once I win

Well If i was you I’d be more worried about meeting your girls parents than getting a ticket. But to each his own. Let me know if you’re in the Santa Monica/Westwood area and want to go riding while you’re here. I know a few good spots.

Is there anyway I could get my hands on your dismissal/case at all? I’m fighting the same exact ticket in Irvine in two weeks. While my defense looks alright, having proof that another judge dismissed the exact same law for the same reason should seal the deal for me. My citation was for 

CVC 21956
(a) No pedestrian may walk upon any roadway outside of a business or residence district otherwise than close to his or her left-hand edge of the roadway.

Yeah, let me see if I can find the paper work. I can send you the defense I wrote for myself as well if you would like.

perhaps not esk8 specific, but at the very least it’s related...

My son was given a ticket for riding an esk8 on campus at Cal Poly SLO. To be fair, there are posted signs that say no skateboards on campus, but he was riding on the bike path that cuts through campus, not acting inappropriately or riding crazy, just moving with other people on bikes. 

There are literally hundreds of bikes (Electric and normal) riding up and down the same bike path every day. It’s BS to single out skateboards for doing the exact same thing. 

Asked my son to fight it in court citing AB-604.
