***Now before I start I want to say that I have no ill from any American Vendors. You guys are great and your services are A one. Please Keep it up what you do.***

I've been thinking about this for a long time and a recent post made me think about it further. American Vendors, your current stock is trash (please don't stone me). Hear me out. America is an very large country, large enough that even through the the Northern Hemisphere's winter Period, a portion of it is still ESK8 Friendly. So there's always a market somewhere even if for 4-6 months it dwindles. 

Now I'm not sure about Europe as a whole , but I bet you guys don't get the most generous weather or seasonal periods and get far less ride time than say the State of Florida or Texas. Yet, when I look at the Euro ESK8 Shops compared to American ESK8 shops , there's a stark difference of items and variety.

Arguably, the biggest ESK8 Market Place is [DIY Electric Skateboards](https://). They have mounts, kits, motors and all the things you expect to see. *But thats it*. It's limited to its brand items and [while they do have things on the way](https://www.facebook.com/diyelectricskateboard/posts/), its still not diverse enough. 

We got [Eskating.eu](https://eskating.eu) offering: [motor covers](https://eskating.eu/product/eskating-pulleys-and-belts-covers-for-electric-skateboards-2x/), [wire grommets](https://eskating.eu/product/soft-rounded-black-gasket-for-motor-and-sensor-wires5pcs/), [nose guards](https://eskating.eu/product/bombsquad-universal-noseguard/), [lights](https://eskating.eu/product/bombsquad-universal-noseguard/), [**fully assembled** drivetrains](https://eskating.eu/product/electric-skating-assembled-kit-7020-watts/), [water proof covers](https://eskating.eu/product/waterproof-cover-for-on-off-bms-switch-20mm/), [**fully assembled** antisparks](https://eskating.eu/product/waterproof-cover-for-on-off-bms-switch-20mm/)

[Unikboards](https://www.unikboards.com/en/) has [diverse variety of wheels](https://www.unikboards.com/en/categorie-produit/classic-skate-parts/), [Focbox Cases](https://www.unikboards.com/en/boutique/focbox-dual-aluminium-case/), and [Cable Risers](https://www.unikboards.com/en/boutique/riser-pad/)

Hell the EU is even getting Goddamn [**Gear Drives**](https://shop.3dservisas.eu/collections/drivetrain/products/fatboy-mini-drive-train-1-3-for-abec11-107mm-wheels-on-torqueboards-218mm-trucks?variant=12108149719133) , [**Push to Start AntiSparks**](http://electricskateboard.repair/index.php?id_product=41&controller=product), [**better looking motors**](http://www.trampaboards.com/136-kv-2400w-dc-brushless-motor-6364-61-p-12967.html). 


And I'm not saying they're unavailable to us NA folks cause they obviously are, but it would be nice to have a good diverse market back at home. Yes we have absolute great products here at home (such as psychotiller's [surfrod mounts](https://psychotiller.com/products/shop/motor-mounts), marcmt88's [mounts](https://www.janux-esk8.com/all-products), and Jlab's upcoming projects), but were a tad behind.

Personally I would like to see more [Thingyverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/search?q=esk8&dwh=465b660cbd657d1) designs being made in good quality and sold. I would like to see the forum used more to get a direct consensus of what product to make, make a poll or something and act based on the marketing potential from there. 

American Vendors please broaden your horizon. 

TLDR; The EU ESK8 Parts market is more diverse than the American ESK8 Parts market and something needs to change

Do you realize?
1. EU is closer to China, so cheaper and faster shipping
2. EU actually have more manufacturing industry than U.S.
3. There's a US China Trade War happening on metal and other goods
4. U.S. has a smaller population and more spreadout
5. American are more favor to pre-made board than DIY.
6. We the America ppl uses imperial measurement which is pissing me off all the time.

Enertion do not cater for diy anymore at all and that's a shame.  Jason being the astute business man that he obviously is must mean there is not a big enough market yet.  Nothing would give me more pleasure than to start an esk8 business but we need manufacturers and that just requires too much investment and my wife won't let me sell the house or any of our 3 children.
Unreasonable women are.

I won’t address some of the points since some of them were addressed by other users already but:

[quote="Winfly, post:2, topic:63836"]
There’s a US China Trade War happening on metal and other goods
[/quote]

It really sucks but this is something that’s been prevalanet since even before the recent trade war activity. Does this war extend to things such as Plastic and Rubber? @Alphamail, has the recent trade war effect the PU industry in any way? 

 [quote="Winfly, post:2, topic:63836"]
* U.S. has a smaller population and more spreadout
* American are more favor to pre-made board than DIY.
[/quote]

True but only by 200M (well that still is a lot), and some countries Ban EKS8s (looking at you Germany) which dwindles the population even more from the ESK8 worldwide population. And we sure do love our Premade boards , but there’s a still a present population of US builders.

[quote="Winfly, post:2, topic:63836"]
We the America ppl uses imperial measurement which is pissing me off all the time.
[/quote]

Lol doesn’t matter to me since I can’t measure for shit in either measurement (I kid I kid but I have the inability to visualize a measurement) 😂

You guys stop complaining and should come to Aus. We have nothing here that doesn’t really come from here. Enertion used to be good and that’s about it. Our battery guys have a ridiculous pricing and every other bits and pieces either have to come from the US, China or Europe with some higher shipping costs Boone really appreciates.

I swear to God I'm gonna get this tatood on my frikkin forehead, Im so tired if saying it...

This ain't Walmart or Amazon Prime.  This market is miniscule compared to underwear, tampons, Pop Tarts, etc.  If you want a 6374 motor for 60 bucks, they can be had...they are crap and even make terrible paper weights, but you can get them in the US.  @psychotiller and @JLabs and @torqueboards all have fuckin great motors, all of which are available right here in the US. 

Sure @okp makes some badass gear, but it's specialized. There's not room for 6 people to make $200 risers or evolve 63mm motor mounts.  If the market would support it, that's what everyone would be selling. 

This is an issue with sourcing and market availability, nothing more. Go by Dave a beer and ask him why he doesn't sell lime green motor covers with LEDs and a bottle opener included. His answer will be that there's no profit and likely because HE wouldn't use it. 

Go get a steak with Dexter and bring the conversation around to "so when are the frilly lace laser cut grip tape patterns in dung yellow coming out?". His answer will be " dude, WTF is wring with you?". 

He Jared, when am I gonna be able get water melon jolly rancher flavored wheels?  

 I'll say it one more time for you slow folks...

1.  This is an issue with sourcing and market availability, nothing more
2.  This ain't Walmart or Amazon Prime

*** I would buy the hell out of some 97mm 75a water melon jolly rancher flavored wheels 😁

Interesting and I’ll even admit that might lack of knowledge really lead to the naivety of this post and topic as a whole, so I do appreciate everyone’s comments since it’s helping shape my thoughts on this. 

Again , I ain’t mean no I’ll will against any US vendors since I do love you guys. I’m just frustrated at the rate of diverse offerings that the EU has compared so the US

God...I’m sounding like Donald Trump... someone hit me already.

Great perspective and I appreciate you sharing it. But it is one-sided specifically for a DIY Consumer which is a very small market. In a business sense, it can be good but can also be bad. Just depends on what your goals are of course. True DIY'ers make their own parts hence the reason why there are so many options available on Thingiverse but those parts will always typically always be a DIY part (not enough scale, niche item, not many people will need or want it as it's not a complete solution).

Selling smaller niche items or 3d printed parts is a temporary bandaid solution. No need for us to sell that if you can just 3d print it. A 3D printer costs about $200 for a small decent one nowadays.

We're currently focusing on R&D to change the landscape and provide more reliable commercial products for the DIY Market as well as a Pre-built market.

As a small business, you can't scale complete diversity.. Only large corporations like Amazon/Walmart/etc can scale diversity because they have unlimited man power and capital to do so.

It's the same reason why Enertion has one board and one board only and it only makes good business sense to do it in that way.

America's not so bad.  The finest and most commercially successful electric longboard in the world is designed a few miles from my home in Mountain View, California - and North American-designed products dominate regular longboarding and skate. 

I also take heart seeing a focus on platforms and not parts.

Lacroix just set the bar for this; instead of manufacturing 10 different decks with 10 different purposes, Lacroix launched one focused, esk8-only platform and they've catapulted themselves from literal obscurity to being reviewed among the best esk8 platforms in the world.

Likewise, Kaly's remix of the Trampa formula - up-armoring a Trampa for Brooklyn road duty and giving it enough juice to cross Manhattan - platform.

I even think we're seeing a whole new class of "Super Duty" AT sleds emerge, like the new @psychotiller and @treenutter collab on the Red Ember 44 that's designed specifically for Psycho Six Shooters on Surf Rodz.

I understand your point; an American firm could easily design a cohesive line of esk8 accessories for the DIY enthusiast.

It seems to me, however, that the wind in the Americas is blowing towards more esk8 platforms, instead of any dedicated focus on parts.  I think that's good. :)

Seriously I don't mind waiting for parts to arrive because truth be told most purchases are made on line nowadays anyway but to be able to walk into a shop and pick up a set of six shooters just makes me jealous as all hell lol  I was reading @psychotiller post about new wheel stock and @thisguyhere said don't ship mine i'll pick them up 
wow to be able to do that!  lucky bastards!!
That said most of the major parts that I do order are shipped from the states.
Its not even the lack of vendors over here that gets me its the lack of machine shops where you can get small parts made up. Yes there are lots of fabricators out there but unless you are buying serious amounts won't do a one off or small order at all.  Just not interested.  
The market in the US is so much bigger too especially used parts and such.  So many times something I really want pops up on here and is stateside. 
So moral is
Revel in what you have guys it could be so much worse!!

Italian [Eskating.eu](https://eskating.eu/) simply rock!! Just in a blink, the last few months increased its items offering exponentially, both in cuantity and quality. Their delivery datelines are top notch. Frigging esk8 company.

Another company its been growing and delivering tons of new items lately is US [DIY Electric Skateboards]().

I think american CUSTOMERS need to do better. 

You may have noticed an abrupt pause to my retail selection. This is because i didn't stomach the over $5000 in charge backs i had this year very well. Apparently its perfectly ok to call the bank and get all of your money back and still not return any of the items you received. I'm going to remember this the next time i need to refurnish my fucking house, i guess. 

That's only one minor reason i'm focusing on my own boards and less on wierd bullshit and side projects and trying to put kits together. Another reason is this: without substantial startup capital there is no real money in retail of DIY esk8 parts. If you can't reach a critical volume fast enough, you end up playing catch up the rest of the time.  Trying to claw your way up by leapfrogging bulk orders and using this to pay for that and that to pay for the next thing only works if you happen to nail the demand most of the time. This is why TB is successful, and Enertion. When Dexter isn't coming up with his own shit, he's asking people like me what would be on our wish lists. For example, he hit me up and probably about a dozen other people when he was about to release his 218mm trucks. he kept revising his motor mounts because they kept being crap, but all the while he sold the shit out of them. 

Enertion leveraged the community to get started, created a community to maintain itself, and will eventually leave the community once its purpose has ended. They are the titans of leapfrogging. Easily construed with bloodthirsty sharks, as well. 

Evolve is the epitome of maximizing sales while minimizing effort. I've never seen a board with simpler construction or more basic parts. Even ArcBoards are more complex in most ways. They give no fucks about it, either. All the way to the bank. 

But people like me? Shit. If i can do better, fucking hell. Maybe somebody would like to show up at my shop with a quarter million in capital and then we can talk about doing better. It took me three fucking years to go from "taking money so i can build boards" to "building boards so i can then take money." Its probably going to be another three years before i can have stock to sell in actual retail locations. Or, maybe, somebody could pay me to quit my day job. That would probably eliminate a lot of the issues i'm having. 

And if i quit doing the evolve mods i won't be able to keep the biills paid to keep doing any of this shit... but man they are a time suck. 

The struggle is real.

I'm learning alot from this post as well as the others and you made a great point earlier. I'm not going to change the title as it would be like me covering up my mistake and arrogance but I will as you and the other vendors this: **what can we , the consumers, do better?**

What is a vendor exactly? We have a no vendor bashing rule here. At what point does someone become a vendor because I'm currently in possession of a battery built by someone here who makes and repairs batteries. American and definitely needs to do better because his workmanship is questionable which never should be when it's something that can burn a house down or take a life.

I have yet to receive the refund that was promised but I did give him until this Friday. Reminder was sent over the weekend and I have heard nothing.

Even if we have more vendors here in the states, it would take a while before the trust is built to the point where they are profitable.

```
I would classify a vendor as a person. group of people who sell a products, simple as that.  Obviously there are exceptions to every rule.  If someone is selling a service, that person is a vendor, in my eyes.  Especially if they have sold the same service to multiple people.  

I think it comes down to to characteristics.

1.  A person or Group that sells a Product and/or Service to multiple people, is actively advertising their Product and/or Service should be qualified as a Vendor
2.   A person or Group that sells a Product and/or Service to multiple people with the end objective being profit should be qualified as a Vendor

I would hate to see Bob S. Dumbdick who is selling his used pitted junky ass kegels qualified as a vendor.  But I also think that if you are making a gadget in your garage and selling multiples for a profit, that makes you a vendor.

I will say this, as a personal rule, Im very careful who I buy battery and battery products from.  A half assed battery is a quick way to get to the emergency room.  If a person/vendor does this more than 1 time (as 1 time can always be a mistake out of a builders control) that person/vendor should be barred from selling on this forum forever.  Just my opinion...
