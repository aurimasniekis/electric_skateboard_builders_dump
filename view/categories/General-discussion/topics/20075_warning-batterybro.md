I think they've imploded.  I made an order for 50 Panasonic 18650 cells and several standalone chargers.  Well, the Cells arrived, but the label wrap didn't quite make it all the way around the can so they kapton taped it - so obviously not a genuine Panasonic cell; and none of the chargers arrived.  

I have emailed several people and their support email several times and gotten no response. 

So do not buy from BatteryBro.

Can you post a pic of the cells?
I have also ordered once from batteryBro in the beginning when I wasn't as well versed in the 18650 suppliers in europe and in hindsight paid a lot over margin for my 50 pieces of LG MJ1s.

Nowadays I'm mostly looking at stuff from Nkon

Thanks for this heads up! I'm in the market for 50 cells right now and this is good info. 

Anyone know if liionwholesale.com is still a reputable vendor? I'm in Canada so nkon is not an option.

Yup... LOL
What the intern doesn't know is that they used to come with those nasty stickers that fall apart whenever you tried to take them off on individual cells...
I'm sure I rubbed off all of my fingerprints... :frowning:

@SimosMCmuffin here's a pic of the suspect cell.  Note how the metal of the can is visible below the Kapton tape

I tested these and they do hold their rated capacity, but I can't ship them.

Note that these were purchased for a non e-skate project.

That's so weird, I thought you meant the end wasnt covered, not that the heatshrink did not go all the way around...
Maybe they are some old cells or cells that got damaged during shipping and they rewrapped them.
I don't see why they would do such a crappy job though.

That is not part of tha can. It seems like they have an additonal protection PCB (Cell level bms).
It seems like a part of that.
Can you provide some detailed pics to be sure.

Seems they sent you a bonus (battery protection) and you are complaining for that haha.<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/9/5/955df2e891f0475e20c66ba8ace94ebf20e8e7e3.jpg" width="690" height="439">

@DougM Just take it off and you will have perfect brand cells as it seems.

Thanks @fedestanco and @flatsp0t - I did order them with protection.  Seems as though I've had protected cells before and they were properly wrapped, but ok, this makes me less cranky.

There's still the issue of where my missing chargers are and why no-one at BatterBro will answer my emails.

Hey mate, in Auckland. I bought off these guys in Germany, cheap shipping too, It will forward you to there Russian branch, so oyu save a lot on their tax. Lots of forums suggested them to me. I was originally looking battery Bro but they never returned me emails when I asked questions. 

https://www.nkon.nl/rechargeable/18650-size/samsung-inr-18650-30q-3000mah.html

Their Nickel is legit too - passed the grind and rust test.  I got stung off eBay and AliExp "Pure Nickel" they claimed.

Thanks for the tip! I'm shopping around for about 500 cells and this is enough for me to want to give them a try.
