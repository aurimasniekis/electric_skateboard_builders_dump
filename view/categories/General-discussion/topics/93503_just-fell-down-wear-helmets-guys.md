I was on my way back to work from lunch on my Sidekick when somebody threw dirty water with detergent on the pavement, right over some painted slow down sign, it was slippery as soap. My rear drive slipped freacking fast and i fell down on my left arm and my head hit the pavement as a whip, it would have been a deadly fall if I wasn't using my TSG evolution helmet and even though I felt dizzy for 10 seconds.

I'm pretty sure I'd be in ER by now or even dead, so this is just a friendly reminder for all of you to wear helmets, I´m so gratefull to be wearing mine during the fall.

Scary stuff. Glad you are ok. Were you riding Pnuemetics or  urethanes?

I was runing Caguamas, those are pretty slippery on wet roads

When your rear wheels loose traction the hit goes directly to your rear scull like a whip, you don't understand how much I'm loving my helmet right now.

I was naively planning on waterproofing my board until I returned home one day just as rain was starting to fall, and my caguamas slid away from me as if on ice. I was going very slow because I thought that might happen, but it still caught me by surprise! Glad you are alright!

[quote="Deckoz, post:6, topic:93503"]
if you are riding wet on urethane, ride a speed that never requires the brake, in this case, know your route, and adjust your speed down to a lower average… because braking on wet urethane is asking to get high sided… so just don’t make yourself have to brake…
[/quote]

This is some awesome advice right here.  I second this.

Thanks @Deckoz I'll buy the the GForms right away.

I was just riding at cruise speed, really low maybe 20km/hr but a lady threw water with detergent over the pavement, here in Lims, in some places, street food carts just throw the water over the pavement after washing their dishes, this might not have happened with Bergmeister wheels but my Century had no spare belts at the moment

Yeah I also had an incident with slippy roads anyhow (foot braking) + (knowledge of how rear wheel slides work) saved my ass.

Watched any online snow driving fail videos?
had a nice RC car when you were a kiddie?

Ever do DH longboarding?

If your rear wheels go ----> then use the top control to turn -----> this will hopefully balance out the drift
but expect your rear to fly back the other way because you over compensated.

I was driving on the left side of the road and my rear wheels locked up and went this way ---->
onto traffic so I leaned this way a little ---> and then my rear wheels went back this way <----
so I started turning into the side walk and my foot brake foot did what it had to.

Thanks for the bong water man it helped. 

I was slow (unlike you) and like it was near the end of my braking when that occurred.

I feel like the board was saved from flying off the road not me. (and I already got one board squashed on that road :face_with_hand_over_mouth:) PS please make some sort satire out of that, I'd love to hear it.

its not often you see a skateboarding crash up-close where the helmet did its job.
this video is eye opening for those that don't wear one now


EDIT: its not graphic or disturbing, dont worry

My fall was silimar than that, the violence of the impact of the helmet to the ground was massive.

The rear slid and I was hiutting the floor in less than 0.5s, impossible to control

I was just thinking about hooking up for a ride this weekend, but remembered tomorrow is my 1yr anniversary from broken knee accident, figured it'd be best to stay off it this weekend... for the wife sake  :roll_eyes:

Mate when you come off its usually a bolt out of the blue.  Steering into a slide is something most drivers know about but it has no relevance on a skateboard unless its a controlled slide.  This was not that.  Unless you have the reactions of a cat then you're going down.

Pretty sure Alan knows how to drift a car too.

it doesn't matter how good your reflexes are. a fall at 25mph is almost impossible to prep for. wear a helmet and gloves at a minimum. its saved me several times

Skating is inherently dangerous, eskating ever more so. be safe guys

That is a very real thing.  Fall anxiety.  After my first fall I didn't ride for a week and it took 3 quick beers to get me back on and relaxed.  Almost the exact same damage too.  Hand, shoulder back and elbow.  Slow fall that one sub 15mph.  The last one was a proper doozy at at least 25mph.  Found out just how high a kerb transition you can roll over with 97mm urethane.  Dead stop and a full shoulder to roll.  No damage at all. Muscle memory, kevlar reinforced bike jacket and luck is all.  
Alan glad you're ok bud and order those pads.

yeah i was nowhere near 25mph but I get where your coming from as in practically at this common (24mph) esk8 speed the tricks I mentioned are useless.

but I heard @Sender ran off a board at 24 mph but he's an army freak  like captain america so :man_shrugging:

Bailing at 25 and falling at 25 are different! I can safely bail at 25 and be ok. But a sudden unexpected fall is impossible to combat. 


I fractured my wrist at 15 when i hit some sand and lost control

One of the reasons I use pnuemetics 95% of the time. I have riden my carvons like twice in 2 months. 

On regular thane, I am constantly anxious about hitting something and falling. On nummies, I barely even look down and its so much more relaxed. if I know the road is good, I take urethane. Otherwise, I am taking the pnuemetics everytime.

even as much disappointing like eskaters in full protection gear rocking full speed through parks where others( children,dogs and so on) seem to no matter at all.
They are safe but others are in extreme danger because of their dumb, egoistic behavior. Saw that in more than a dozen videos and these dumbs guys are responsible for us all getting treated by the people. And then there is a thread which is called: why so much hate? Because very much of us(not all) are giving a shit about others. Unfortunately true! Do I have to ride 30 mph through a park where kids play and people walk their dogs on sunshine days? Eskaters, think about that!
Edit: @Deckoz your edit is speaking my soul: road rage is the keyword! Great!

“edit: Incase you aren’t picking up what I’m putting down, don’t bring undo stress to yourself if you are not prepared for it. calmness and assessment of everything in life before action will bring you nothing but blisss… take that how you want. but seriously… no need to bring road rage to carving the land.”


Could not agree more.

I have a tsg pass....but I’ve never worn it. I know I do very reckless things so you can save calling me a dumb ass. I’ve worn a helmet once ever and typically reach well over 20mph. Today I was going about 12 mph and I didn’t take a turn sharp enough before the approaching curve. My head smacked the curb but it wasn’t too bad because I half caught myself. What really hurts is it sent one of my tooth’s through my front lip.

Happy you're ok! 

I hope you're buying a new helmet as a replacement because the shell and foam have served their purpose and are now compromised.
