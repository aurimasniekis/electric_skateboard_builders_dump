Don't route it too thin:

Damn

That look bad, I think the main problem is that you routed on of the carbon fiber layers

Hope you are good

I'm good, a few scrapes. It was going slow thankfully.

Maybe. Idk, the deck split clean on a layer. Maybe the glue wasn't strong enough? I made it as thick as some of my drop through decks so I assumed it was good.

Could it be, mine I made sure to leave both layers intact and went to hell and back with it and it’s as new

This was the 12s8p build, yeah? It could be the degree of weight on it that isnt present on other drop through builds? Or bad layer adhesion as you've said, but that would be a first for hummie decks.

Glad that you're okay though!

Motor cans were hitting the deck. I routed the bottom before routing the top for the baseplate. Just one of those two would have been enough.

This was the low rider build but swapped the rspec drive for an AT drive.

When this happens the best thing to do is to use the motor itself with sand paper wrapped around, you only remove material that actually needs to be removed

That sucks. Can you cut off the broken part and still have enough room for a G bomb bracket? I wonder if an extra wide plate on top of the baseplate would have spread the load enough for this to have not happened.

Yeah I'm thinking of DIY-ing a new baseplate mount using metal plates of some sort.

Soo to repair this I'm thinking of routing the bottom clean and wood gluing a new block of wood. Then I'll use the spare hummie decks I have as a routing template and route it back to shape.

Whats a good type of wood to buy from home depot for this application?

[/quote]

That's the thing though, it was so close to the deck that you couldn't even turn. Probably around 2mm of gap. It's less of the deck hitting the motors and more of it completely being blocked so I really needed to route it out. It would take a really long time with the sandpaper method. 

But you're right, I removed too much material.

It would be tricky for sure, I’d call it a dead deck unless you want to get creative 

That bracket could be a help in a resurrection attempt but it’s not cheap as you noticed.

Backwards but you would probably need to route it into the deck

I'm glad about the dropped bracket style taking off. Yours seems like an elaborated shape from mine. You ordered them with the same old school mounting, no?

A dedicated LDP deck is what you need. They are perfect for this application. There are some production LDP decks suitable for these brackets. [Rocket Exodus](http://rocketlongboards.ch/product/exodus/) or [Antidote Hurricane](https://m.facebook.com/commerce/products/1844934242236580/)
