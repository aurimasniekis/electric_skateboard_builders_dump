I think it might be all predatory animals.  Me and my son were at the local university riding around this weekend and just happened to ride over by the lion.  She really liked the sound of the electric skateboards,  She chased my son around the outside of her habitat for 20 minutes.  You can see it here...  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8MJbmA0ljw

I think dogs can hear the high frequency audible noise that comes from the motors due to the motor controller using PWM. It's in the region of 20kHz so outside of the human hearing range

sometimes it seems like its the sound but I've seen dogs that go crazy from a regular skateboard also.
I think its just they see us moving in a strange way, too fast, so maybe a threat... :thinking:

my dog loves mine.. I walk her (well, she runs to keep up actually) around the neighborhood with my board and she couldn't care less about any noises it makes.

In fact, she starts wagging every time I grab it because it means she might get to go on an adventure.

It's like those apps that do the super high frequency whistle and the dogs go ape shit. Seriously, download it and bring it to a dog park ðŸ˜‚

My dog hates my board, she barks at it lol. I'll try @cmatson technique of walking (esk8ing) my dog. She probably would get left behind though.

most dog are simply astounded by boards in general - can always see the "WTF" over their heads cause boards arent a very common form of transportation. just take it slow, take enough distance and coast to reduce the motor noise when you pass dogs, especially when you pass them from behind.

have you guys tried that stun light out yet?  on yourself?  I remember people using them for drinking games.  My dog used to run through our electric underground fence on full charge no problem.  I tried it to test it and made a squealing noise it blasted me so badly..dogs don't seem to mind as much.

such systems are not allowed in the EU for many reasons, same with these retarded shock leashes that allow to punish things you dont like about your dog and probably screw up your dog completely cause many people are simply too unobservant (frankly: too dumb) to train or simply lead a dog. imagine a dog sees a kid, runs friendly towards it, gets shocked. the logical connection for the dog is most likely: kids are horrible and next time they might bite it ... and who could blame them.

ill have to stop reading this thread cause it will just make me angry. shock fences, ultrasonic apps, stun lights, ... :expressionless:

if you have no clue about dogs and you ride a skateboard, at least try to memorise a few of the **guardian breeds**, cause these were selected to guard their pack and they will be the most dangerous for you as a **quickly approaching, aggressively humming manbeast.**

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guardian_Dog_Group

most prominent guardian breeds around where I live:

german shepherd
american bulldog
boxer
doberman
giant schnauzer
rottweiler

you cant blame these kind of breeds if you approach them like an idiot (fast, close, loud).

its not always a bicyclists fault when things like that happen, but I think there is a good chance that the vast majority of bicyclists is provoking this behavior by passing too close and too fast without any clue about the trigger mechanisms for certain dog breeds.

I agree though, if you cant control your dog, you should take it on a leash. but you can do your part as a bicyclist to avoid these things instead of provoking it.

The true purpose of the stun gun in relation to dogs, is to make an intimidating loud crack and lightning bolt. If a dog sees that it will prob take note. I have been chased 4 times, they have come running at me out of nowhere, completely unavoidable. Bit by a cattle looking dog. If you love dogs so much that you would rather get bit than shock a dog ,than i am sorry for your candidates recent loss in the presidential election

Mike and i saw these at the electronics convention. I had the dude zap me on the leg for a split second, it definitely does not feel good. The videos online say to aim for places with a lot of nerves like crotch or face/ neck. I could only imagine what a cock shock would feel like

I let my cousin ride my road cycle for the first time around a round roaded neighborhood while i was running along side her, one homeowner had a big dog unleashed and it started barking and chasing us, it ran past me and after my cousin who being too focused on the dog, ran into a parked car. Thankfully no damage to bike or car or cousin(GG for helmet) (she rode right into the car wheel). Dog runs back to owner.

I was riding around the park the other day several times and passed the same dog 4 times. The 4th time he nearly escaped his owners leash and it would have been a disaster cause I was cruising. I'm in bldc mode right now. Makes me wonder if foc would be less irritating to them?

It won't matter ... it's mostly the movement I'm sure...

Just hoping that the sound of the zap will be enough...

Getting chased on a board is no fun .... every time I just wanted to stop but...prob would of been nipped at if I did stop .... the panic is getting tripped up trying to get away....streeting ones face while trying to get away would really suck

I E-skate with my dogs almost daily.  A big Lab mix and a newer Golden Retriever who has endless amounts of energy.  It's an efficient way of getting their exercise in quickly when I have very little free time living in "Dadville" ;)
You need to have good control of the dog to avoid accidents (shortened leash and strong arms in case you need to hold the direction).  Oh, and SQUIRRELS!!!...and cats, other dogs, interesting smells, etc.....

Not e-powered, but same concept and I love having brakes now....

It's usual to come across many dogs when I'm riding my electric longboard but no problem until now, usually they go around their business and let me alone. Some of them chase me but are small dogs, they don't scare me. :)

But seriously, Dogs are kinda stupid. In that regard, Cats are much much wiser, independent and with more character. Cats respect themselves, have more self-control and they don't give you their loyalty easy. A dog that chases cars is using his most primitive instincts like if the wheels were squirrels or bunnies. In a way, dumb animals.

Had a nice little chase from a couple of Chihuahuas going through a neighborhood the other day. Now, not sure if this is a dog vs esk8 thing, or a Chihuahua vs the world thing, but those two little f-ers hated me skating by. They were chasing and ankle biting 'til I hit speed and tore around a corner. They followed for a minute but couldn't keep up :smile:

In my mind when I took the corner they rolled like an older car chase movie, but in reality they just have tiny legs hahaha

You realize that cats just think you are a really terrible cat right?  I like cats, don't misunderstand, I've had mine for 12 years and Bean is as badass as they come...but cats are not deep thinkers and will eat you if you happen to die with them in the same building.

@pixelsilva i can tell you never had a dog. if you did youd be amazed by their observational and social skills. 
their often comical way of dealing with things is just the dogs way of getting to you. they know exactly what you like and love about them. :relaxed:

a dog chasing cars? never seen that one and if at all theyd probably do it for fun, cause â€žthe huntâ€œ satisfies primal needs. same thing with chasings balls or sticks.

i got 2 dogs and they never chased anything but prey. first time they saw animals on tv they licked the screen, looked behind the tv and that was the end of the story. they love humans unless they classify them as weird - been growling at drunk people, a weird man hiding behind a tree in the forest, people walking around my house and trying to look inside. all in all they judged every situation perfectly and thats not a suprise at all cause thats what dogs are really good at.

99% of cat owners are irresponsible for letting them roam free to kill wild life, crap on others property, damage car paintwork. And cat owners have the audacity to moan about drivers running them over too. Ive killed 3 in 3 years, with many near misses, because for some reason they feel compelled to dash in front of my car whilst driving, Very intelligent. 

Its not cats i have a problem with, its their owners and society for keep an animal that has not been fully domesticated. Im not a dog person either but at least most owners do not let them roam, it wont eat you if you die either. 

Oh and cats loyal??? seriously.

It looks stunning!

Its been a mystery for long time. The board is for kite surfing, is a D-Ex (I think from the UK) with elliptical Genesis trucks I believe. Those wheels are the real mystery. What brand and size they are? They look awesome and have the right profile, thickness and width. Just big and wide enough to become candidate for esk8 projects. I always tought they were R-Spec Ghost, but that is just a hunch. What do you think?

Where the hell do you live where dogs are just roaming around not in a fenced area or chained up? :slight_smile:

Got chased by a small dog a few weeks back, I went full throttle and lost it but the damn thing kept up for a while probably till I hit 20mph. I was more afraid if it getting caught up in my wheels and effing us both up more than it biting me, after that incident the owner doesn't let the dog out with out a leash anymore but it still tries to break free and chase me when it sees me.

.... **sorrentino**, you let them run free and unchained, when you live in a country like this:

Dogs just hate skateboarders and generally they are picking up on cues from their owners.

Dogs read subtle subconscious reactions by their owners.

...to this day I don't know what subtle subconscious reactions the stupid dogs are reading when chasing Bridgestone radial tires (??)
