So my next board I'm planning on building is an evo, but I'm going to have to wait till Feb before I can get my hands on some carvon xl drives. 

I'm trying to see if belt drive until then is an option. Want to go pretty budget on the trucks/ mount etc as it won't be permanent. i did some searching and actually didn't find anything on any belt drive evo done before. Anyone have an info on previous builds like this?

Interesting that both of you mounted the motors inward. Not sure if I could swing that with steeet wheels.

Seen anyone ever do them out the rear?

Why do you think you cannot with street wheels? Are you worried about clearance to the ground?

Does anyone know of a press in pulley available that will work with the caliber 2 narrow tolerances (dual 6355)?
