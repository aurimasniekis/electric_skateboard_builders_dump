For a couple reasons i've managed to nab myself a set of maytech hub motors for a good price locally with a catch...no trucks.

supposedly pulse boards has some lying around they do sell individually but i'm having a hard time getting in touch with them.
so, are there other storefronts state side that sell the squared off trucks?
