I'm kind of afraid of this new fonction since people from the future can speak to us

It's kind of weird in phone because when you click to chat it zooms in and scrolls the page behind.

Hahaha! I guess it's because of the time zone deference. I'm from Greece, which is GMT +02:00. That means that here(Greece) it's 03:15 a.m. on Friday the 17th. :smile:

No textbox to type in. Maybe its b/c of being in mobile version?

Bug report: When I get a notification that someone mentioned me in a chat (in the top right, where my icon is), and I click on the notification, it tries to go to a relevant page (http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/chat/general-discussion/17820/427 in this case) but then sends me to a dead page (http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/404)

There is an issue filed on the plugins website about the safari issues. The author said he was going to look at it soon. If He hasn't fixed it by Tuesday I'm planning on bringing my Mac home to fix the safari/ios issues.
