So I was trying to get my hands on the bms with   
 e-switch from bestech and was told they no longer make it. This 10s 80a bms was discontinued and upgraded as mentioned on the email received. This is what I was given for reference can anyone may be shed some light on whether it will still work the same from the data sheets? Of course I have emailed the rep at bestech that is helping me with the purchase with my questions but wondering if anyone on here can may be give me info on this. I circled the areas in question

```
who was your contact at Bestech?
I just emailed my sales contact about it. I'll report back when I get an answer.
It will be a shame if they discontinue the HCX-D223V1 Modules.
the overcharge detection and the over discharge detection should be adjustable but the balance current is not and 42ma is low.
the HCX-D223V1  had a balance current of 126ma

I can't find an HCX-D596 on their website???

@Namasaki Yea its Lucy. She told me she was just informed today about it when she tried to process my order. She said the hcx-d596 was an upgrade to this bms and it wasn't on their site because the change was so recent. I'm still waiting on thier response because I haven't decided on getting it yet. If I don't then I will have to shop around for something else and I didnt want to. I still want to know if it will work the same as the other with the same features just some minor adjustments. But I will make my decision after they respond back because what I want to know is will it work the same if the balance current can be adjusted?

I don’t like the balance current and I especially don’t like the short detection of 480a. 
What good is short detection after your board is already on fire?

What would be a good short detection average? If its adjustable I will ask for it but in not too convinced of this upgrade seems more like a downgrade to me

```
It seems like a downgrade to me as well. 

Seems like the D223V1 could detect a short at very low current. 
Once I shorted my charge port and the bms shut down instantly so that there was no damage to batteries, electronics or wiring. 
Only the pins in the charge port suffered arc damage. 
Well, maybe that was high current but only for a fraction of a second.

There is still the battery supports but they don’t have a built in E-switch and thier balancing current is only 62ma
They don’t have good heat sinks either

@Namasaki so I got a hold of someone thru Alibaba and they gave me the same deal they no longer carry the old model but he gave me a different data sheet. The balance current changed a little bit but the detection delay didn't. Now I'm curious plus I have a headache from trying to figure all this out from Bestech.

Bummer maybe but is this still a viable option to make a 12s battery pack with an eswitch even though the circuit protections are at a higher level?

I feel like it's not that bad... i always now
incorporate @goldenHusky anti-spark protection and set the settings to like 80a max on Vesc6 so I don't see what could go wrong.

Hey dude... this caught my eye a few times... is this the 12S version? It doesn't say on the website. Unless of course 10S-12S is same BMS for bestech -- apologies for my ignorance -- only previously purchase a SuPower.

EDIT: Nevermind looks like you don't ship to the US.

I am buying the remaining (6) HCX-D223V1 --- I will keep 2-3 of them.  Rest I will sell @ cost @ USPS shipping first class mail.  This isn't a group buy just me and I will have a few left.

It appears that they still have some HCX-D223V1 for 12s but not for 10s
So if your ordering modules for 10s they will probably send you the new version

All you have to do is look at the circuit board. Either behind the balance connector or on the flip side, there should be cell numbers for each pin.
The solder pads for the main and charge wires should also be marked.

I have had them completely forget my orders, or send me only half on an order. Also, when I emailed to check on orders they said they refunded me. Which they didn't. Always keep an eye on your orders with them. Seems like there is a communication breakdown in their supply chain.
