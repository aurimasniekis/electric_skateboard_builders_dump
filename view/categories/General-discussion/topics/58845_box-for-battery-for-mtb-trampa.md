What's the exact size of your battery pack? Add some space and then you can compare the internal size of boxes.

I use a PeliCase 1150, the 1120 is a smaller one.

I think u need to search for "peli,can" cases. The other name might have been ultrabox

Check some other builds, for example made by @barajabali

Sorry for duplicating pelicase suggestion. That was an earlier reply
