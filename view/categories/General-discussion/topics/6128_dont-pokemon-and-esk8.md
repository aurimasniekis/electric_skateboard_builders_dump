Damn dude. I hope that's the worst of it. Still looks pretty painful. I've been testing my hub setup with only a helmet and even topping out at 17mph, it makes me nervous not having more protection on.

lol sorry, I was playing pokemon go around my neighborhood and I was on the sidewalk coming back from a pokestop and the sidewalk was uneven. I did not realize HOW uneven until I had been flung into the street, almost being hit by a car.

So is this a Esk8 related injury or a Pokemon Trainer scar ? :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

yes, do NOT ride until you have one. it only takes an instant to turn into a vegetable.

Drink plenty of water and ice up your shoulder.

HAHA! I guess this is the first instance of pokemon and esk8 related accident? :joy:

Seriously though, you probably tear a shoulder muscle or something, better to go see the doctor and have it check out. Also, apply ice pack to your shoulder or any areas that hurt (but do not show physical bleeding) for the next 24 hrs to prevent scaring of the muscle and inflammation. Good luck dude!

Too many people have been getting hurt playing pokemon!

It's more dangerous than eboards!

@link5505 all the best and speedy recovery. Hope it's not too bad. 

you should change the title of your post to something like: "Don't skate and play with your mobile at the same time..." or "always watch where you're going while eboarding .." or "don't be distracted while riding .."

tsg pass is a awesome helmet! not cheap though, alternatively some mtb helmet will do, full face makes sense!
