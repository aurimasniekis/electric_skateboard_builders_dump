So... This is the new Koowheel!

**Koowheel D3M (2017)**

What parts have been upgraded: 

1. PCB: Koowheel customized upgraded PCB, durable and stable quality. 
P.S: Passed by very tough road test, such as down and climbed more than 30 degrees slope.
2. Remote: 2.4Ghz digital connection and new look design.
3. Battery: Original 5500mAh LG battery supporting 20-25km without a break. What's more, new adding a adapter for removable battery that can be charged directly.
4. Motor: Dual Brushless Hub-Motors upgraded with replaceable PU.

And that's how it looks:

Alrighty folks - flame away, but DAMN i was impressed the couple times i rode my brothers Koowheel!

It's not a hill climber - regardless of what they claim.  But moved my considerable bulk along surprisingly well (120kg/265-270lbs) - even up some hills i didn't expect it to make it.

Brother (@Byrd) got his about 6 mo ago and has had 2-3 swap/repairs to get it reliable.  I'd watch the connector on the battery as it was the last issue we figured out - too much pressure tightening it maybe elongated the contacts and made them inconsistent.  Since then it's been great for his kids and occasionally me when i'm over.

We just built a full DIY dual motor for him, and he's been laughing as he accelerates up every hill in sight...  

On a budget and don't want to solder - especially lighter riders - Koowheel is a solid hub'd option IMO.

Agree'd, My friend got one(not the 2017 version) since he didnt wanna DIY, we rode it this weekend. The remote is abit sensetive for me coming from the GT2B mini but it was way beyond my expectations. Hes not had it for long so cant say much more than my first impressions. We had nearly a 20km run aswell and battery levels was still high when we got back.

On a budget or for kids...

I'm not settling for average performance, touchy remotes, connections that don't stay connected and wheels that look like toys. And did they paint the thane on? 

Looks like they tried to copy the inboard remote.

Also, not abt to support a company that steals content to make it look like their own. Check the video below...looks like @onloop works for @Koowheeleskateboard . Boycott Koolwheel

They keep on upgrading/evolving parts, this is a good business model, I think that's what kept them selling thousands. 

However I do hate the wheels

They stole it from Halo, before Inboard was even a thing:

I'm really tempted to try one as my first board instead of investing a lot of time and money in a DIY even though it seems to be the way to go according to most threads.
Also I would really hate if the board fails on me and I have to send it in for a swap/repair as I really don't like to wait, but rather want to fix the issue myself. 

There's almost no hills where I live and I weigh about 155lbs so I guess the koowheel should do the trick for me in terms of torque and speed as I'm also new to skating.

Do you think it would be a bad idea to start with a board like the koowheel and then later on upgrade/replace parts with DIY or would this seem like a waste of money?

You can't do DIY repairs on any brand skateboard

You can't do a DIY board without investing time and money for knowledge

You can't avoid a board to fail on you sometime in the future, more even when you are buying a 500 bucks one

Nobody with tell you this is a good or bad idea and if they do there's no guarantee you will be happy for a long time

For that price range is the best board

I have a Koowheel D3m. The updated (supposedly) version. Don't get me wrong I haven't had a lick of problems from it in the four months since purchase, BUT trust me it will not be what you want. I've learned that the hard way. Only DIY has everything you are looking for because you are building it the way you want it, not the way a focus group or whatever thinks you want it.

Thank's for your replies. It all seems logical. However, I don't quite understand why I shouldn't be able to remove the motherboard and replace it with another ESC and receiver of my choice. When the motherboard is replaced I dont see why it shouldn't be possible to change the hubs for others or a belt setup. 

However, at that point there's only the battery and the deck left so I see your point.

Edit: I'm actually pretty sure that I'm going for the DIY solution instead of buying something I can't fix. I've been building race quads for quite a while and I'm pretty confident that I'm able to figure the electronics myself. 

Can't wait to get started :D

Ok so I've been riding this new model for three days now no problems this far. Changes from older model are 
1) new remote 
2) braking and acceleration is smoother 
4) no battery indicator on the board it's on the remote 
5) it would appear the push start button 7 times to u lock top speed no longer works (unsure whether permanently on fast or not)
7) the rubber can now be changed on the motor wheels 
8) all so far released come as the all black  like the speacial edition onyx version
