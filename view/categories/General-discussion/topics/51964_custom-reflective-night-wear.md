Hey Guys,

So as part of my job I work with commercial embroidery machines. I do all digitizing (what they call designing stitch files in embroidery world) in house, using the absolute best software available for the job (Wilcom ES4). I have every color of Polyneon in stock, as well as some specialty threads.

Anyway, I like skating at night sometimes, but the only jacket I have that's reflective is a windbreaker that fills with air, causing a miniature low-flying blimp effect lol. I've used Glow in the Dark thread because I never grew up, but let's face it GITD does not make sense as a safety precaution unless you're stopping to juice up the light retention every so often.

So today I ordered some 3M reflective applique plus metallic gold and silver thread. The reflective applique is perfect for being seen in low light, and for covering larger areas without your thread count skyrocketing into the 100k+ realm. Basically just trolling for ideas and tips. If there is anything you guys would want to see let me know, supplies should be in in time to start stitching the first try the beginning of next week.

**Not a for sale post. This thread is for banging around ideas for fun, progress updates on my project, pictures, etc. If there is enough interest and they come out really well I can offer them as a custom service, but for now let's just do it for the pleasure of doing it**

This is one of the dumb ideas I thought of this morning before I decided to kick around ideas with the forum. Will probably never make this one but its the first thing that came to mind. Fill section is 3M Reflective, satin trim in metallic silver thread. 

I'll probably end up doing a character with a large word. Me and my daughter love Bendy or Little Nightmares so one of those characters would be sweet (plus I have already vectored and digitized artworks she likes for various applications, just cause I like making her stuff. Last week I came home with a purse lmao. I kid you not I even sewed up straps, added, a snap clasp, it was ridiculous)

![hit me|624x500](upload://gROx8sS5b18uoJX1W8GO8bsecDu.jpg)

The original thought I had was this, or a giant middle finger lol. But lets face it I don't even wear clothes with swear words on them, I'm not in college. The above artwork is not a final version either, notice the border distortion in the "A". Something not visible but it also needs all its stitching orders changed so every letter lines up perfectly with it's corresponding border. **So yeah, this is where I am currently at in the project : Material ordered, should have first jacket ready early next week. Let's get some cool ideas flowing!**

Technically I can just start making one the second the material gets delivered, as it's stuff I already do, but lets shoot for next week 'cause life and I have a ton of parts coming in for my 2018 build.

Will definitely be making different designs. Was just showing the reflective appliques to the owner of a large trucking company we do business with while he was picking up hats, as the material will meet reflective standards. So now there's no going back lol, I have to order more reflective material already and the first order isn't even 2 hours old, because he wants at least one for each driver.

We have distribution accounts with multiple apparel manufacturers so if I do end up offering custom work on here we can even do small orders, or mix matched orders of different sizes and SKU's to cut the apparel cost for customers (by combining the shipping from seller to us). You guys would just go on the sites, pick your apparel, and we'd add it to a weekly order coming our way or something. 

But I'm getting WAY ahead of myself, still just doing this for fun lol

The thread manufacturer I order from doesn't carry true reflective thread but I will definitely check that out! 

I exclusively use Madeira thread as it is one of the industry standard thread manufacturers. The process I am using for this post is using sheets known as appliques which are then stitched onto the garment. I think embroidered appliques would be more along the lines for our use as a lot of reflective stuff should be big and bold, and large size like that done in all embroidery thread gets costly very quickly.

Perfect example, that "dont hit me" text I showed above would be 84k stitches, taking about an hour and a half per garment. The reflective thread if I could find a quality one will easily cost 4x that of normal thread, though thread cost compared to time is minimal. With that in mind, doing this with relfective applique would bring your stitch count to 30k, more than halving the cost and time to create each piece. 

Don't get me wrong I still want true reflective thread if I can find good quality, that would be great for chasing small designs or smaller text!

Would it be possible to stitch some EL wire onto a jacket/hoodie?

Thanks @TheFluffiest! When you look for the material it is called 3M  Reflective Sheet. I'll throw a link to the one I'll be using next week

http://www.madeiramart.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=specials.reflectivesolutions&tp_preview=true&ContentId=511

@mmaner I'm sure it is possible, but definitely more sewing than I'm willing to put in. To make a sleeve you'd cut strip of sheer cloth the length of the EL wire, and the width would be the diameter + 1/2". Fold in half, and sew up along one side between about 1/8"-1/4" from the side (1/4" will be super tight to the diameter, I would do 1/8" to give your wire some wiggle room) Then turn it inside out.

buuuut you'd still to sew it to the existing jacket. And without it looking horrible. Honestly a good seamstress could do it, I don't think I could without spending a lot of time figuring out the kinks. I only use my regular sewing machine for easy projects. 

An easier option to use that wire is already out there, but you won't be able to do custom designs with it. You find a jacket with a cord running through it that matches how you won't it to look and isn't opaque, then swap it out or run alongside it. I'm sure a cosplay forum would know a better way. Cool ass idea though

If you made the clothes you could integrate it, but once again way more sewing than I want to do lol

Hahaha nice, yeah I don't do much manual sewing, I can get do anything basic around the house, or make stuff with a pattern, but that's about it

Got my wheels turning though, that's always fun. I spent a solid twenty minutes daydreaming about using the machine to lay wide satin stitches over the EL wire... but in the end I figured I wouldn't be able to do the lengths/areas necessary to truly make it look good.

I've seen something called retroreflective tape. It is designed to reflect directly back in the direction of the light. It is the same stuff used on construction jackets. It's kinda a grey color. Is this the same stuff the thread is made of?

I bet that would work really well! Plus it'd be removable

Ok almost done with my frist draft for my jacket. I just yanked this clipart from Google so I'll probably re-draw the entire thing before I actually run it.

In this instance I am laying down the applique material and using tight backstitching to add the detail.

![dont blink|593x499](upload://kQ6Jwsyf8dCccmYjxN2Mb2Nv1SS.PNG)

It still needs some love for the letter outlining and obviously to finish adding in the details

Sort of, the applique I am referring IS that stuff, 3M Silver Reflective, but it's not actually a thread. Its a sheet that you apply with embroidery. It meets safety standards :) But yes that's the same stuff used for safety vests

Just have it run down to a pocket and chuck the battery pack in there. 

Or yanno you could be super duper cool and run it down to your feet into your shoes (which are also el wired) and run it into one of those little wireless charging pad things that is in the board then bam, when you stand on your deck instant eye strain for drivers

Ok next idea. Big ass hand, as in talk to the, also known as the crossing guard middle finger.

Maybe a mandala version to give it some umph. Wait a minute this is a jacket not a lower back tattoo... hmmm

Nice I'm glad this project is turning some gears :slight_smile:

These are all great ideas. I should have the first samples done by the beginning of next week. My reflective sheets have already been shipped out and should be waiting for me when I return to the office Monday. 

For the more detailed stuff, such as the skeleton or the lines of the angel what we'll do is stitch a satin outline around the perimeter of the object, then go back with black (or any dark color) and stitch in the detail. For example the skeleton  we could invert the color so it's silver and the details are dark, or put it inside a slightly larger bordering background, making him dark again the silver

Should look really cool at night! 

With text well need to remember to keep it big and bold if you want the letters to shine, or to do a reflective background with dark letters for thinner stuff. Can't wait to get started!

Oh crap I totally forgot to update, I started creating objects out of all these ideas so they'd be easily editable. My reflective sheet came in this afternoon but I got hung up working, dinner, then spending time on my own build. So far I did a few different skulls, all the text ideas on the thread, and adjusted some other designs I was working on for this project. I'm hoping to stitch out a reflective sample tomorrow

I did slap together a boney boards in hat size but really I just was starting with creating the objects and happened to stitch this out while I was tinkering with the CHP badge order (gotta get those brownie points in case they try to give me esk8 grief ya know)

I just Googled it man :D This was done small, and I used stitching to do the letters rather than outlining applique letters which will be the process we use for big and reflective

I stitched it out on some flat backing just because one of the embroidery machines was doing nothing. But honestly if I were to actually stitch it on a hat I would redo the skull as meant for that size, just to make it look cleaner and crisper.

Hoping to do some cool samples today!

Forgot I had a dentist appointment yesterday so that sucked up a couple hours of my day and really killed my ambition for the rest of it lol

I did start my first two reflective applique test passes so I will post it as soon as I get a chance to finish. I ended up ordering spools of true metallic gold and silver as well which came in, so the first sample for the trucking company is 3M Reflective sheet with metallic silver borders and metallic gold shadowing for the larger letters. 

The metallic I thought would look cool mixed with the reflective, as it will catch the light in a different way as well as draw the eye during the day. It may not be up 

Here's the first test pass I ran, I did the silver/gold I outlined above, and for the lower panel used a regular non-metallic silver that matches well. I also showed using black text on top of reflective sheet to verify it looks clean. I'm really anal about small mistakes so let's go ahead and point them all out lol

1. Could save run time by pre-cutting shapes, then laying down a placement stitch. For exact measurements will test cutting settings to do it with our lasers. 

2. Small areas such as inside of "G" need to be filled in with color of garment AFTER tack down stitches, but BEFORE final applique border

3. Slight movement of "IA" due to push/pull causing slight space between shadow and applique border, add slight overlap and pull compensation so it wont happen on final sample. 

4. Remove small amount of column width from black lettering, looks a little congested. 

5. Will do applique stitching manually, though the program did it well, I feel I could have halved the amount of applique work by tacking down all shapes first before the frameout and cutting

6. There are some tiny bits of applique peeking outside of the border, won't be in the next pass I was using different scissors at the time.

![40|690x388](upload://8grngX42F6JopV44QNjNlZ5n4zv.jpg)

The fluorescent lighting doesn't do the colors justice, test pass 2 is in the machine now and I will do an actual wearable sample this afternoon. Will start with a large middle finger + Text or the Boney Boards logo

First actual sample is currently running. Instead of using the applique tools included in my amazing program, I decided to do it all manually, and I think it will come out even better.

I also went a little nuts with my main stitching outline. Rather than your every day Satin stitches, I added a 3D effect and made them huge and raised! I didn't use 3D foam to raise them, but rather multiple satin layers. I'll post it as soon as I get back from lunch :)

I also found out from a coworker while I was running this one that you can actually get pulled over for displaying offensive terms/images displayed in public. It may depend where you live, I personally am located in California. Disturbing the peace meh

This topic has finally come to fruition! Well, at least for my personal jacket lol

I loved the middle finger idea, but for my own ended up going with a cartoon glove version. I could have lived without the text but let's face it I just wanted to see if I could. Not bad for my second try eh?  :tongue: (I guess its the first real try as my earlier sample was just playing with different applique settings)

Thanks guys! Next up for final applique digitizing is Boney Boards (considering I'm about halfway done with it already)

@akhlut I'll PM you sometime today or tomorrow about size/color/style and we'll make something sweet

Once we get a few good samples out of the way I'll see if I can work out some type of pricing, art limits/requirements, and ordering timeframe and I can start producing these for anybody who wants to order

If any other embroiderer wants to reach out with questions I'd be happy to teach/help you accomplish the same results. I did this mainly for fun and to see if I could, I already have a job lol. But what I WOULD like to see is more and more esk8ers being safer :D

Finally got a chance to transfer that pic, super busy today.

Wasn't happy with these results, I went too trigger-happy with the layered satins (3d raised effect) which caused bunching when laid on top of the reflective sheet. I've already digitized the necessary changes but haven't ran another Boney Boards one since, as my machines are currently running an order that should finish later today.

```
We call those bunching areas "puckering", and in this case it is just because there are way too many stitches in the raised satin going the same direction, which pulls at the fabric. 

My changed file has the letters set to fills, but with the stitch angles corresponding to how they look on the satins. I added some density to the fills themselves so they will have slightly more coverage than that shown in the eyes. 

Still looks really cool when the light hits it though :)

That looks super bad ass. I definitely want that on a t-shirt maybe like your jacket where the thread is only outlined. That should be less likely to pucker I would think and then it will be really seen at night. Then something on the back so people see me from behind.

```
If it were a regular satin then doing on outline would actually double the puckering effect, in this particular case it's because of the raised effect. What the raised effect does is lay down a narrow satin column, then 3 more increasing the width each pass. It's 4x the amount of stitches per object part.

ANYWAY lol I believe I get what you're saying. You'd like the letters separated by outlines, where the letter itself is the reflective material. For your specific letters this would have to be done a different way, as even enlarged as they are your letters contain lines that are too narrow to border on both sides. There is a limit to what can be accurately cut out, even should I pre-cut the shape with a laser, getting it to stitch down correctly orientated with small details would be a nightmare.

Here is a rendering of how your lettering would need to be done, each full letter (or word if letter outlines are close enough) would be one piece of applique with a border, with the negative space filled in with thread.

This capital B is sized the same as the first last image I showed, with border added about 3"x3" The small connecting lines can be removed in the final, but are usually close to not noticeable and make for a better stitchout

Here is the other sample I ran, it's the second version of the first one I did for the trucking company. This was done in their colors and without any raised 3d effects needed. If you look at the word "TRUCKING" you can see an example of fill stitching done on top of reflective, this did not have any extra density added but it could have for a more even cover. 

"Santa Maria, CA" is done in a normal satin, small amount of puckering but should smooth out.

Also, notice how the small areas are filled in between the letters such as the inside of the "G"s, cutting into the with small scissors was not even an option, so that is a smaller scale example of removing the negative space with thread which is how we would accomplish the detail of your letters

That sounds fine. My main this is I would want the letters and skull to be the reflective part so however you want to do that is perfectly fine by me. And if it’s to much work you can’t just say hey I can’t do that it rocks be a pain in the ass. If you need to keep that little stitch in there on the smaller parts that’s cool with me.
