I hooked up with someone who buys broken VESC's and after my Esk8 trip to the post office, I was heading the 1.5 mile journey back. The way I got there, I was standing and riding in the bike lane. On my way back I thought I choose to sit on my board. Flying over ground cracks and speeding above the poorly paved pedestrian side walk at 20mph was never that fun. UNTIL I heard a loud police siren... 🚨

Chills went down my spine. :skull:

I stop, turned around and saw this police dude on a motorcycle slowing uttered "Can you do me a favor. Ride it like a normal skateboard, wear a helmet, and don't skate on the sidewalk." and left in a hurry. I thought I was gonna get a ticket. Lesson learned: DON'T ride esk8 on the sidewalk. Unless you're pedaling. Obviously, I wasn't gonna pedal half a mile back, so I just stood and rode slowing and safely got to my house writing this. :joy:

Any other interesting stories you want to share? Comment below your experience with Big Brother in Esk8. :grinning:

Yep. Always ride like you're on a skateboard dude. It's less dangerous considering if you're standing up and more people are apt to see you. ;)

My one time experience so far is... I was pulled over after passing a cop in a 25mph zone going 31mph. He said I'm lucky that there's no speed limit in the bike lane and left. I was was pretty stoked!!!

I would stand. But I weigh only 110 lb and don't' get enough traction unless I sit. Plus I can emergency break sitting down. :peach: And pedestrians can see my plain site too. But you're right, standing makes you more visible.

I don't know about you, I just can't accelerate as fast standing because I tend to lean forward standing. 

Tell me you can floor the breaks standing up 20mph.

We gotta get you trained on a non-electric board for a while dude. That way you will be able to handle it no matter your weight class. My 7 year old (40lbs I think. lol) daughter rides my dual board standing straight up no problem. It's weighs 20lbs which is half her weight!!!

Lesson should first and foremost be WEAR A HELMET. 

Also if you weight only 110lbs and can't get traction...wear a helmet

If you are unable to ride a skateboard like a skateboard....wear a helmet![5806426693_e9d193ee2e_b|690x460](upload://8hkjKgVUd8opzufhmjDQWiXJ6tD.jpg)

I sit on my boards sometimes. Specially when I ride with my dog and kids. But my case is different. I ride on sidewalks only and at lower speeds. I guess that's unwise on the road.

I was pulled over on my boosted board in the bike lane this summer. 

The cop issued me a ticket for “failure to use turning signals”. The ticket was for $185 and 2 points on my license. 

I disputed the charge obviously and my court date is in the spring sometime. 

Getting a ticket on a skateboard made me feel both angry and flattered:

I agree but there are times when you should just let it roll over. I would ride faster but the roads here are full of potholes and the bike lanes aren't consistant. Turning street corners is a bit of pain since I don't have a kicktail.

You have way more observation advantages standing it sounds like you just need more practice to build up your confidence,stick to the speed you feel safe at and dual is a good idea for the extra control but stay safe until you feel comfortable at speed.

Try moving your wallet to your left back pocket; if you're sitting on your board and it's listing to the left at 20 MPH, it's almost certainly a postural concern.

Best of luck to you.

Lol. My friend and I were cruising down the road at about 20mph the other night, cop was coming the opposite direction of us, flashed his lights, rolled down the window and yelled at us, “GET BACK ON THE SIDEWALK!!”

Oh yeah I should mention that there were no other cars on the road at the time

Ha. My very first build was a penny board on caliber trucks and since it was so small my friends had to sit on it. My skate goon friend took a challenge to ride full throttle down a 40mph road with us following in the car behind and guess what? After 30 seconds, a cop car tailed us, wondering why we were going so slow (25mph), passed us, saw my goon on my esk8 and yelled "get in the bike lane!" and speed off. lucky he was busy. 
What made it funnier was that he was wearing full mount bike gear and sitting on a tiny penny board going 25mph like mario cart.

We did it on a penny board bc the thing was so light that if you go of the trigger you'll get pulled forward and you can't even balance at 15mph let alone go 25. I sometimes sit on my longboard because I lean too forward standing up and I get a lot of traction on my drive wheel sitting towards the back. Feels like a go-kart too. :rotating_light:

oh man you stepped in it now. some of the sickest skaters i've seen on insta are chicks so what's up? Nevermind the fact that i sit when i pee because my mommy isn't around to clean up the splashed urine from around the toilet and i hate cleaning bathrooms.

This whole thread hurts my head. 

butt boarding is awesome but has no place in traffic. Do it on bike trails or in chill neighborhoods or something. WTF people if cars can't see you you may as well call them up and ask them to kill you. 

and wear a fucking helmet. 

and if you can't hit your brakes and not fall off your board at 20+ mph, one of two things is happening: either you have less than enough experience and need to ride more in a safe place for practice, or your settings are just terrible. Trust me, terrible settings can throw even the most experienced rider. I've been to the ER a few times over terrible settings. Mostly to the bushes, but sometimes to the hospital. 

also, in general, degrading women as an insult to men isn't going to win you any points with the growing AND EQUALLY POWERFUL female population of the esk8 community, nor with me, an outspoken feminist.

and feminism Is not something you use to look cool,
there's the normal side of them and theirs the nasty side teenagers Looking for meanings and means.

You don't have to be a woman to think that women should be treated as well as men and stand up for their right for equal pay, equal benefits, and equal opportunity. You just have to be a human being with a fucking conscience and some level of empathy. Basically, not a psychopath.  But even a psychopath can fake appropriate behavior where deemed necessary, so really there's no excuse to not feel this way.

Dang! We should get together and as we say in Sweden ”kissa i kors” which pretty much means crossing pee-beams. Maybe that is a thing in the us, maybe not.

So to sum everything up: -

Zackory doesn't wear a helmet and sits, rather than stands on his board for some reason
Most people seem to take great offence to this
Jedi compares sitting on your board to a bathroom break (5th out of 98 comments that started a descent into discussing pee)
mikenopolis has his toilet on a skateboard (hoping photoshop had a hand in that photo)
lennylogs actually got fined by a cop for not using turn signals (cool new idea......e-skate turn signal light thingy's)
warman can brake at 35mph for most things, making me wonder what the other things are (squirrels maybe?)
longhairedboy is an outspoken feminist, and has proved it.
you don't have to be a woman to be a feminist (every day's a school day)
This is a very important thread
longhairedboy pees on peoples heads when they don't wear a helmet
smatter also pee's (unsure if he means on people heads)
atlesk8 pee's for recreation (but hasn't explained how)
there's a device that lets women pee like men

Not sure what to take away from all this, but zackory best wear a helmet before his head gets wet on a sunny day

>I only weigh 110lb and don't get enough traction

The friction force between your feet and the board is proportional to your mass. The force required to accelerate you is proportional to your mass. The mass cancels out and is therefore irrelevant. Learn to skate before you ruin this for all of us.

Edit: wow I was really late to this thread. I feel like I missed the party.

That's not true.

The friction force between your feet and the board is proportional to your **weight**. The force required to accelerate you is proportional to your **mass**. On the Earth's surface, the mass and weight nearly cancel out and are therefore irrelevant.

Just remember "mass" is quantity of quantum stuffs, and weight = force

gravity acts on mass to create force/weight

And don't forget the first rule of biodynamics:

Assuming you're not accelerating up and down, your mass is proportional to your weight, so the friction is still proportional to your mass. It's all semantics really.

Well, if your pee is cooler than the speed controller it should still help. If you drink enough you won't even need a radiator, you could just dump the spent coolant as you go. If you angle it backward it could even be a source of thrust.

only on Earth. I think that was the point he was making. But since we're all here, we can call it that. 

Ironically, Earth don't weight shit (she's floating though space) but has a fuckton of mass. Enough to generate the gravity that makes this scenario possible in which its only semantics. I suppose Sol would be her bathroom scale if we were to be rude and discuss her figure...

By the way.  The earth does have weight considering the product of its mass and the suns gravitational pull for example.
