**Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.**

**HUB MOTORS**

Before Inboard started their Kickstarter campaign hub motors where already starting to gain momentum in online forums & in the garages of hobbyists. In December 2014 Endless Sphere forum user "jacobbloy" published his hub motor designs to the community & started a beta program to further test his design.

Inboard have also changed their hub motor design substantially making it much more similar to the Jacob Bloy design which uses arc shaped magnets.

**VESC MOTOR CONTROLLER**

In September 2014 Endless Sphere forum user "austindavid" created a thread "10S Custom Skate ESC: testers wanted" This thread is about the open source motor controller designed by Benjamin Vedder. This thread is actually where the VESC got its name. Vedders ESC Became known as the VESC. surprise, surprise photos have now started to appear on the Inboard kickstarter page & facebook page showing them working on their M1 motor controller that looks identical 

**Suprise Suprise... it's a VESC.to the VESC.**

ARGH. They could call it any superlative they want, but I hate when the say they did it first, like they invented an in-wheel motored skate, or worse, hub motors themselves.

From the interview published two days ago: "We've designed the first electric skateboard with the motor actually inside the wheel of the skateboard, and all the electronics inside the deck."
