Creating your first topic!
--------------------------

Start by clicking "**+New Topic**" here:<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/1/12a9923d0df93bdfb5b9f915cd4963dc3e0c8848.png" width="690" height="78">



Now you will see a blank box ready for you to add text. Here is an example once some text has been added: <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/3/3010780265babb361fdbd3186124867895c16bad.png" width="690" height="237">

1)First, give your topic a name, and in this case it is **Creating your first post!**
2)select a topic that it fits in, in this case it is **General Discussion**
3)add some optional tags at the bottom such as #VESC is you are using a vesc electronic speed control.

If your catagory is an eboard build, please abide by the following requested title format:
------------------------------------------------------------------------

In order to make the "E-board Builds" category really easy to search & locate specific builds we are asking that you change your title to something descriptive that better expresses the makeup of your build.

Most of the new build threads tend to end up with a name such as 
**"new- noob - noobie - beginner - first - build - help - newb"** this becomes hard to keep track of.

I would like to see each build thread with a descriptive title, such as;
**Project Name | Deck Name | Trucks | Motor type | Mounting method | Voltage/Battery | ESC**

Example
**The Samurai | Custom Deck | Paris Trucks | R-SPEC | Custom Mount | 10S | VESC**Navigating the tool bar!
------------------------

You must read a certain number of threads, and spend a certain amount of time on the forum browsing before permission is granted to make a thread. 

It doesn't take long, don't worry!

Hello, this is my first post, so please be patient with me.

I have an initial idea of what my longboard build will be. Atm i have already purchased the following: 
- Longboard Deck, 
- Caliber II Longboard Trucks, 50 Degrees.
- Orangatang Kegel 80mm Wheels.
- 30 Teeth HDT 5mm Pitch 11mm wide wheel pulley
- 20 Teeth HDT 5mm Pitch 11mm wide motor pulley.
The pulleys have already been drilled and connected to the wheels.

I'd like to create a 10s4p Samsung 30Q battery pack. But im unsure about what type of bms i should buy, if you have any recommendations please provide them, or if you can teach me about how to pick a bms, that would be greatly appreciated.
I would like to get dual Turnigy Aerodrive SK3 - 6354-260kv, and dual vesc.
What are your thoughts and comments will be appreciated

@moderators can we split this into a new topic?

@aras_96 Looks pretty good! I would say that if you're aiming for a 10s battery on a VESC (you didn't mention what esc you might use, so I'm assuming a bit here), it's a great combination IMHO, but I would aim for a motor with a lower kv, under 230 would be my recommendation.

HI all,

i just joined today....i don't have a new topic button available yet...so posting it here..

i bought the swagtron swagboard for 200 bucks on amazon a week ago...i never skateboarded before...i started learning skateboard 2 weeks before ...just for fun riding around neighbourhood..never planning to go to skatepark or do tricks..i am little older for that...28.......i am an average with respect to activity scale...i have been snowboarding for 3 seasons now..i would say i am an intermediate now in snowboarding. 

the reason why i explain those here is ....i am scared to go fast downhill on skateboard....i know it is just mental thing....but i have been using the brake option on the swagboard remote a lot when going downhill....because i am scared the board would wobble or i may not be able to turn it as fast as it has to go past the corner. 

i know i just have to spend more time with the board....my third day was much better than the first day....but i am just amazed at the videos form youtube..where people stop on downhill with famous boards like boosted , evolve and starting to think may be those boards would help me better?
