Was lucky enough to catch the live feed on this and "tame the taipan" last weekend. Check the slow-mo! :star_struck:

The last major turn at "forest elbow" took a lot of riders out of the running. You will see it around the 1 minute mark.

Damn I envy those guys.... the control they have over that board at the speed... some marbles on those gentlemen. That speed wobble at around 1:50 was gnarly!!! Dude almost saved it
