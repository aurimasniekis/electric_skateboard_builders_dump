I want to sell parts of my eskate but I can’t post in the parts market. 

What do I have to do to unlock it?

You've got to put in to take out. Basically it is protection against scammers & amoralistic, zero-reputation people who may embellish their wares acual condition or function, sell here then vaporise.

Wanna sell your esk8 parts here? no fees but you have to contribute. It's a super deal

It is indeed a good deal indeed, the only thing is I want to stop eboarding. 

The police already gave me a ticket of 250 euros and 2 weeks later my BMS from my modded evolve board breaks and they won’t fix or replace it.

Stick around, and for kicks find out how to repair it which will allow you to get a much better price or at least by that time sell it here

are you sure your esc didn't blow cause I think evolve uses the same motors as racerstar but they are at 140kv which could cause issues but also easy to fix

Holland, the eskates are forbidden here. 

Although that actually was kind of a soft one, driving a not insured vehicle here can cost tickets of 550 euros plus. 
Also they are allowed to confiscate the vehicle.
