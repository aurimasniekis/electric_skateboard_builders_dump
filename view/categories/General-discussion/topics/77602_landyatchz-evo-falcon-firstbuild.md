Hello, this is my landyatchz Evo Falcon 36" build so far! 

![09%20pm|690x384](upload://Ah7A7LJbZwiw68JvjKMdwLE0LLP.png)   

Are there any faults in my build so far, all prices are in AUD. I am getting a custom 10s5p battery to fit inside the EBoosted falcon enclosure. Any tips will be great and because this is my first ever build ever and I have never owned an electric skateboard. I am getting a lot of Torque Boards stuff (TB) because it is cheaper as a bundle and I only want to have to pay for shipping once,(to Australia shipping can be expensive) also its nice to know that everything will fit together and I know I am not forgetting any thing! Does anybody know what size riser pads or wedges I will need to fit the motors underneath the deck with inward facing mounts. I am hoping @Marsen can make me a battery with a built in BMS and charging port and possible a on and off switch, but I can easily apply the switch myself. When the Part says OPTIONAL, it usually depends on how the battery is made. Thanks for your time!

Have you already bought the falcon?
It seems the regular 39" Evo allows for more flexibility regarding the build (forward facing motors, more room for the battery and electronics) plus it feels less cramped and will allow for a wider stance.
Although the Falcon is 36" since it is a drop down deck, space is limited.

I you haven't done so already, you'll want to check https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/first-build-vera-evo-36-dual-foc-6355-190kv-10s5p-30q-107mm-metr-pro/58551. Note that 10s5p, two focboxes and a small BMS is the absolute max you can squeeze into that enclosure. Consider 10s4p instead to avoid things getting cramped.

@taz I am still at the planning stage for the build so I havnt bought anything yet. I like the falcon Becuase itâ€™s smaller and I am 160cm so I donâ€™t need a big deck

@Marsen and @Lobbie I would seriously consider building this around the evo 39". As @janpom pointed out it's a mission to fit 10s5p in the eboosted enclosure and forward motor mounting is all but impossible unless you dewedge the back truck completely. At that point I fear ride comfort and stability would be compromised.

The 39 allows all of this easily. @Deckoz got a monster 13s into the eboosted 39" enclosure in fact.

Trust me on this one!

Yes. There are many examples in the forum with forward mounted motors.
Just do a search with keywords landyachtz evo and I am sure you will find many.
Here is mine .

The 39 isn't that huge of a difference in stance. My wife has pushed mine around (haven't built it yet) and she loves the deck. Told her that the 36 was out there and she kinda turned up her nose at a shorter deck.

I usually push loaded decks, so maybe I'm just used to a longer platform. The flare outs fit perfectly around my feet and I can lock into in in multiple different foot positions.

EDIT: and yea, I've seen alot of people have trouble forward mounting their motors on the 36, but usually on the 39, they don't have a problem.

I personally love a slightly shorter deck.  A couple inches off the deck length can make a pretty big difference in ability to carry it around without smacking the ends of the board on doorways and such.  That's why I use the Landyachtz 38 Switchblade as opposed to the 40 inch Switchblade.  The 36 switchblade wasn't quite long enough for my stance though.  I can't wait to see pics when you get it finished!

With so many option out there it's easy to change your mind and hard to keep to a decision. Don't think there's the perfect board out there yet or ever will be, what one person likes another may not. Don't rush in to things and take in the advice you get and sift through that. In the end it will be your decision and even then nothing is set in stone and you can change or modify later. I'm back at home for a week so will check out some of this thread and what your looking at doing.

Evo 39 is too big for you.  Get the falcon then keep the battery to 10s and talk to tiller about the enclosure.   Get @moone to do it for you if he will.  The 39 is heavy and to turn it you will need it loosey goosey and then a 12s battery will put you in a ditch.  10s and easy settings on a falcon.

They are a downhill beast.  My youngest loves my arbour.  He doesn't skate so he loves the stability.  Feels safer on that than anything else and he can still turn it,   I'm thinking more along the lines of a sector 9 bintang which is a similar shape.  10s though.  He rides scooters to a level I can only gasp at and I will not let him near the 12s.

I just changed my mind to a 39"and now changed back to a 36" falcon :joy: Lots of people have told me to go for the 39"
[/quote]

I went for the evo because I loved the deck and enclosure combo but it really is not the most manoeuvrable deck out there even for me who is a great big heavy old git.   I think the guys were unaware of your age and size.  You want to be able to turn and have some fun, slides and stuff.  Get something carvy.  You will enjoy it more.

[/quote]
For you not worth the extra weight and size.  Keep the thing light and small as you can.  Build for you, as you are now and not what you see on here because we are mostly full grown and a hell of a lot heavier than you.  Grab a sector 9 and An @Eboosted enclosure and build a beautiful thing that will be better for you.
Hold on I'll call alan for you

I mean motors out the back or under the deck?  If I were you I would go drop through reverse motors and keep that thing low as you can.  Just like the darth maul.  The lower the deck the more stable you'll be and the more able to sling that thing around and trust me thats what you will be wanting.  Slides and hard carves.
If you go the evo route you will end up with a board that is great for straight line speed.

I would rather Under the deck, away and hidden. I want a cruise deck, nice for carving but good for high speed. Is the darth maul good at speed, it looks like a beast. I can't really get a drop though trucks because I am getting the TB dual motor mechanical kit which has included trucks, I want the bundle because i know i am not forgetting anything. To be honest, i don't really know how drop though trucks work, is there a piece that goes on top that could be attached to the TB trucks? Also, what deck is the Darth Maul?

Hey the sector nine is just another drop through cut away deck to be honest.  They are nice and would do the job.  The arbor I have is the same shape and there are a lot of similar decks out there.  How about an integrated deck without an enclosure?  Something you could keep the motors underneath and have a nice quick lightweight board?  That haya is a great deck and I was on the list for that but missed out.  Some of those builds are lovely.  Go check the thread out some more and come back to me.

No worries.
Just ordered a 1500mm x 1000mm cnc router as I plan on making custom enclosures. Either vacuum formed then cnc routed for custom logos and engravings or Possibly carve a complete enclosure from solid ABS. I like the two piece ones enertion do so will do a few designs based on that too. Having the larger cnc machine will enable me to make boards too.
