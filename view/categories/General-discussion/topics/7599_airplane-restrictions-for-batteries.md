I was looking through the forum and found that although we have topics about eboards on airplanes, there is no dedicated topic that specifically goes over the airplane restrictions for eboards. So here's what I know, if anyone else has info to add, please chime in.

-99wh or less is legal, no questions asked
-you can go above that with airline approval, but the battery must be removable
What this means:
6s2p 4500mah li-ion is the prime choice for one battery,  you could go higher if you are using lipos just take them out of the board
-Yuneec ego will not work
-Boosted 6-7 mile range will

In theory if u could break a giant size pack so each now separate pack is under 100wh and itll pass the rules for carry-on no matter how many there are.   Maybe just get smaller packs and disconnect them all for the flight

As far as I got regarding this topic. 
99Wh is allowed, but with the certification that boosted has done for it's board and components.
And up to 2x160Wh but with airline approval.
So chopping up a bigger battery will be limited to 2 pieces as well...

What would be their reason to restrict it, for me it just doesn't make sence. Since all parts together go over the limit. 
So if you would want to be a smartass, you assemble a big pack with battery cages and then for transport you just undo all the 18650 cells separately and ur good to go... :blush:

So what you guys are saying is I can connect my battery via bullets into 4 pieces and I can bring it with me on flights...? 

Not sure the tsa will let that go. It looks even more bomb-like when you split it up into pieces

More cells connected together have more potential to short I think but id rather they made distinctions between chemistries and be more permissive with some of the safer Li-ion.  lg hg2 for example.  Or maybe show that the cells are discharged..don't think it's easy to blow up if ur at low voltage.  
I just read a story from an airline steward talking about how they had a fire on a plane from batteries that was luckily still on the ground.   He said they put it out, wonder how as I read they're really hard to put out and I don't think even oxygen is necessary to keep it going.  I'd be freaked to see someone bringing cells such as Ive been using duct taped to the bottom of my board.  But legal none the less.  Another reason to drink a couple more before the flight, otherwise I feel I have to consciously bring the plane down safely

Speaking of looking like a bomb it would be a good place to hide a bomb. I'm surprised we haven't had many more bomb incidents on planes and in this country.   

A bad battery incident= 100 dead on plane and loss of freedom to put cells on plane
Another bomb or two on a plane= 100 dead on plane and total national freak out and none-stop 6oclock news and likely war and 100,000 dead

Has anyone considered this solution:
Ship your board to a UPS location customer counter pick up in the city your traveling to. And just pick it up when you arrive? Then ship it back to your home address before leaving

I can't remember where I found it but I read at one point that the fire keeps going because as the battery burns it causes a chemical reaction that creates more oxygen. It's almost like Greek fire...

I like the idea, and would like to solve this issue for sure. But for instance li-ions should be around 3.5-3.6V for ideal conditions, if you would drain them completely and frequently, it would shorten the life quite a bit, don't you think?

Even at fully discharged voltage for li-ion, you will still be over the Wh limit.

Also the safety regulation is calculated at nominal voltage, so you won't be legally passing anything with a space cell.

CIf you travel alot I suppose the battery life will be shortened. It's all about getting the battery through checkin and also percieved safety issue with these things.

If I have whatever battery capacity, discharged or at low charge say 20% would be good to leave it in, so you can at least get a ride pff the bat once you unpack the board.
Also put it in a fire rated bag.  Maybe something like the lipo bag https://www.ebay.com.au/itm/291843930122 

Definatley needs a alternative label, but understand this is a legal issue as you are being a tad false with capacity.

Its only becaue I know the capacity. If it has no labels on it id have know idea other than to test output.

Thats another way maybe to get around it that is not pulling the voltage out with a meter, but that would take more time through checkout. No doubt customs may check that anyway.

Surely of I have a low charged battery its going to be safer.

Lithion ions I would have thought only explode if punctured. But im no expert.

That's the whole reason they're heavily restricted for flights. It's not likely they will explode, but the fact that they can leads to all these restrictions on travel with lithium. I'd say forget trying to bring 160wh+ packs aboard and just have a spare pack that's <160wh for traveling.

This is one of the first recorded instances of li-ion batteries bringing down a plane. There's also a few theories floating around that li-ion brought down Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370.

Ok, I put this out there that maybe onloop should look at a split battery design. In 2 parts. 1 99wh and another pack that gets connected together neatly in this Raptors or spcell shells.
 
Depends on whether its cost effective for Enertion to produce. If he designs the battery that way then it will still work fine in his products, but allows the dam things on planes. Id just take the 2 batterys as you say under the requirements.

Some may pay more for that option to be able to have it.

Im not carrying in cargo hold a significant amount of lithion ion batteries or comoustible material. And Im sure significant is alot of batteries.

Ive got a small battery which if I split up would be nothing between 200 odd passengers. I discharge it,have it at low charge, and put it in a fire rated bag.

Fully understand safety issues, but its over the top. Has there actually been100% proof it will cause a fire on the plane for the capacity they are limiting. Where did the come up with that limit. From Boosted. Give me a break,

Is there like a fire rated cupboard on a plane that it could also be put in thats monitored if it goes alight.

Shit who knows what gets missed in the luggage compartments.

If I put a battery in the fire rated bag in the front seat slot. If theres friggin smoke coming out of it eveyone will know and an extinguisher can be used immediately. Having it up in the overhead lockers would be dangerous if it went off as you wouldnt know in time.

My 10cents worth.

Sorry forgot to elaborate. My response was just in general to the thread, like a curious fact about wether or not li-ion could take down a plane. I've gotten 8 4S Phantom batteries and 5 99wh V-Mount batteries through TSA no problem. This was also coupled with a bunch of camera gear, all laid out in separate plastic bins so it didn't really raise any issues. I guess my point is you can probably get away with batteries if you have camera gear?

Even at the lowest safe discharge (2.5v per cell) you'll have 187wh on 3P which is still over. I also highly doubt they sit there with a multimeter to check your voltages. Airlines should measure with nominal voltage as a standard. You can try to slap a 99wh/160wh sticker on the pack but anyone with basic battery knowledge may call you out on it.

I figure it this way. A small battery fire shouldn't bring down a plane, but there is a small possibility that a fire started by a battery could. I think the greater concern is more along the lines of any fire on a plane big or small is not a good thing. The more you can minimize the chance or size of that, the better. It may not bring down a plane, but it would likely cause some damage to surrounding luggage and warrant an emergency landing. Either of which are not good and very costly for the airlines. 

I figure this. They're allowing us to take on the equivalent of a 6s battery. That's generally good enough for 6-8 miles. If you need more. Take two. DIY sells a 6s pack specifically for this purpose. I'm sure one of those packs would fit easily in a Raptor or the SpaceCell enclosure. Or you could get crafty and split a large pack.

Ths issue with travelling at the moment with lithion ion batteries higher than 99Wh for some airlines. 
What can we do? 
Can we put these things in a fire safety slip bag. 
I was thinking just present the battery fully discharge.  Is there an easy way to discharge spacecell without having to run motors. Some other accessory we could plugg it into to fun it down overnight before leaving.  High output light or something. We could use the light. 

 Ok to ride till dead at home before you travel
 Might not be so easy while away and time as your always in a rush when travelling/hols. 
-Definately relabel battery mobiliy battey snd change Whr rating. Could be accessory battery.

Hey guys, just updating this thread with some awesome information I found. 
For you Lipo runners out there, there is an article I found that very specifically goes over the dos and donts of traveling with lipos, as well as the restrictions http://www.dronethusiast.com/traveling-with-lipo-batteries-drone

Also, there is an app about traveling with dangerous goods that you can find in the App Store (iOS) by simply searching "dangerous goods travel". I found it to be fairly simple to use.

So i flew with south west airlines back in December of 2015 and when i got to the gate they knew i had lipos (for a quadcopter) and asked to see them. They where not happy with the number I had (10-20) of zippy compact 2200 mah 35c 3s lipos. So they said i could only take 3 batterys. So i hooked them up in parelle and got 9 on board.(3 sets of 3) so no matter what they say thats what goes at the gait according to the flight crew. What i would recommend it to take your airlines regulations and the tsa regulations and place them on top of you battery in your bag. Just to be safe. 

P.S. Carry your battery on board the plane because of the pressure difference and the flight crew can handle any bad situations. When going through tsa place the battery or any other questionable objects in the last bin with your paper work. So when they flag it you can get you belt and shoes back. Learned that one the hard way!

Not Australia, it's Emirates policy at play here:

"Personal motorised vehicles are not allowed on board. For safety reasons, we can’t accept personal motorised vehicles such as hoverboards, mini-Segways and smart or self-balancing wheels on our flights. We can’t carry them either as checked-in baggage or as hand luggage as they contain large lithium batteries. This regulation still applies even if you’re connecting to our flights from an airline that has accepted them."

I've given a lot of thought into this, as I cannot imagine traveling without my board. I am traveling to Thailand next year, and I don't want leave it to chance that my battery might not make it past airport security. I weighed a couple options including, mailing my battery ahead of time, having a new battery shipped there, and even breaking down my battery pack into smaller 99wh packs and trying my luck with airport security. Even that seems a little risky, cause you never know if TSA is just gonna ruin your day (or vacation for that matter).

I found that the best solution around this, is to find a hobby store in the country you are visiting!! Sometimes the simplest solutions are the best ones! I mean why spend so much money shipping your battery, when you are gonna have to ship it back also, and who knows what kind of import taxes and duty fees you are going to encounter at customs (Thailand can have an import tax up to 90%). So why not just make life easier and buy some cheap Lipos for your vacation battery solution?

With a little research I found this hobby shop in Bangkok: http://www.twinprohobby.com/index.php?page=product&productid=3485&category=9

And thats just one shop, I'm sure there are others. They even have a youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sme6LGB8cEg

This is the battery that they sell:
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/f/6/f6b4004dba0d73a5ca7a3aaa3c59aec3b7803b82.jpg" width="690" height="236">

Who knows if it is a quality cell. But I don't really need it to be. As long as it last for the 2 months i'm there. And for $50-$100, its the cheapest solution that I can think of that guarantees that I will have a board for my trip.

All you need to do is do a little planning in advance. Make sure you bring a charger, and any wires and connectors that you are gonna need. I'm having a 6s6p battery being built right now, but I'm thinking about installing a 6s VGA charging port on my enclosure anyways, so I can easily swap my 6s6p battery with lipos whenever i travel. I think 6s is gonna be the most practical solution when traveling, as it is a lot easier to charge. You just need a simple 6s balance charger.

Something needs to be done about this very quickly. Electric longboards are fast becoming an extremely popular way to get around and I can only hope that battery technology gets better or the flight companies remove their heads from their sphincters.

If Emirates stated that they can't accept personal motorized vehicle, then it's easier for "US" DIY builder to assemble a board that can be taken a part easily during transport. Take off the mount, the belt, the drive wheels and the batteries. Then put the batteries in a laptop bag and place a power bank mark on it. Hence they can't took your board as it's just a normal sporting goods. The parts of the boards are miscellaneous while the batteries disguise might actually work.

TBH lately with the Samsung Galaxy 7 amount that have been caught fire and transported in airplanes, It should be reasonable too to carry large batteries on board.

Thought to throw this in:

http://www.ebikes.ca/product-info/ligo-batteries.html

These are battery modules, you can ''stick'' them together, basic config is 36v and 2.7ah. 

Seems quite smart, though, at least two of these would be needed to get a somewhat decent range / capacity..

No info about the pricing yet either..

Just to put it out there, I recently finished an airplane legal build. Batteries are 99wh (6s 4500mah), and each gets me 4.5 miles of range. Super compact so that I can take it as a carry-on as well. Custom made by barajabali using Basen 26650 cells. Attempting to take it to Germany this coming summer - I'll update everyone on how that goes

To swap them I unscrew the enclosure and unclip the main and balance plugs. Not very easy, but doable if I need more range. Also got one plug charging integrated into the system. Here are a few pictures:

I think a good rule of thumb to use is: If the airliner bans 'mobility assistance vehicles' (with exception of wheelchairs), eg. hoverboards, then it's safe to say that taking an e-board with you would be a very big risk, and likely not acceptable onboard. It is of course leaving it up to interpretation, but splitting the packs mightn't be good enough if security/the airline want to be difficult.

Maybe some ppl find this interesting.. it looks like to be a ''documentation'' of Lithium battery hazards which have happened on airplanes or in airports in general.

Maybe a a123 26650 12s1p battery will fit?
Even boosted did this, why there aren't that much build with it?

@Trans-amers because A123 cells are crazy expensive 😂. Honestly I probably would've gone that route but it was simpler and cheaper to keep it 6s

I've travelled with our Jed Board all wheel drive from Singapore to Sydney and back a few times. It's got a total of over 400wh of power. I disconnected the batteries, put the skateboard in a box and simply just checked it in as a skateboard. Didn't have any issues on either side. 

I'm pretty sure casey's boosted was confiscated as in Oz we have a weird rule about travelling with sporting goods. 

Ultimately the airport is the one who has the final say no matter what the airline says. 

Best carriers I've found for travelling with battery related items are Virgin and Singapore Airlines.

They may be crazy expensive but when I build my air travel safe board, I am going to use the A123 LiFep04 cells. It may be more expensive and they still pose a risk, but I would feel terrible if anything happened because of me so I'm all for minimizing risk. 

Not directed at you specifically, just saw you mention price.

They might be expensive, yet they work well for high power eboards due to its spec. 6s 2p might just have 70A (take Sony konion us18650vtc5a as example) output , vesc can only handle about 50-60A, yet 12s can provide the same torque /power without blowing the vesc up @ 70A using have of the continuous ampere output (in theory)

United Airlines has just recently banned electric skateboards (among other battery-powered mobility devices) in checked or carrying passenger flights.  So would lean towards other airlines for esk8 trips.

Recreational self-propelled vehicles, hoverboards and riding suitcases

In the interest of safety for our customers and employees, we do not accept as checked or carry-on baggage any recreational self-propelled vehicle or device designed to carry one or more persons or goods, and which moves by use of a lithium battery-powered electric motor.

Such devices or vehicles include, but are not limited to:

Smart balance wheels/boards such as Hoverboard, Airboard and Skateboard
Self-balancing wheeled devices such as Ninebot
Battery-assisted bicycles such as e-bikes
Wheeled vehicles or motorcycles
Electrically-powered scooters
Riding, motorized suitcases

If the batteries are removed wouldn't it just be a skateboard?

And they still allow batteries under 99Wh.

I will be traveling with my board and batteries separated to Germany. The batteries will be sealed in separate bags, each 99wh. I already contacted United and they have approved it (and sent me papers along with the approval), but you never know what will happen

Actually I will be heading to Spain and back from US on United, is there a phone number or email address for united that I can try as would be great to have something approved written down I could have with me. As you say, who knows what actually happens at the airport!

Is there an exhaustive list of airports/airlines restrictions on batteries and or electric skate/longboards? If not I would like to make one.
