Second one, how often do you check the forum? Meaning how often do you check in and look at your unread and new tabs.

* 1
* 2
* 3
* 4
* 5
* 6
* 7+ (I am addicted and my wallet is begging me to stop)
[/poll]

Fourth, do you wear protective gear when riding? If so what?
[poll name=poll4 public=true]
* Helmet only
* Helmet and elbow/knee/wrist pads/gloves
* Full face helmet only
* Full face helmet and full protective gear

[/poll]

Fifth, do you skateboard? Meaning do you do flat ground tricks and/or tranny/skatepark skating?

[/poll]

Sixth, hubs or belted system or direct drive gears?

I skate goofy because I balance better on my right foot and my left foot is stronger so I push with my left, but I could see why people would skate regular. Stance isn't really whether you are right or left handed but what suits your body best for the task of skateboarding.

A couple more polls, maybe remote preferences like trigger, thumbwheel or joystick would be cool.

You should move this to the original post, no?

Also, could ask question about the max speed you feel safe with.
