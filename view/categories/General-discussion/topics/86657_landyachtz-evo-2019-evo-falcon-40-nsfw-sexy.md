It does, It has 70mm to 50mm clearance with 6" tires and no risers.

I already got one of these delivered last week from Muirskate that ill be finished building over this weekend in looks like and I'm running psychotillers 6shooters on it with surfrodz and his quick mounts having the motors facing forward under the deck (6365) and no rubbing issues so far with either (tires or motors) when trying but haven't gone for a real ride yet. I'm 6'2 2-- lbs though and cant even really get close to wheel bite at all with all my weight. Just have a tunnel riser in the back and thin rubberish riser for vibrations in the front.

does anyone know if the enclosures for the old evos fit this or is the shape slightly different? Im tired of fighting with the flex on my bhangra and multi piece kydex enclosures and want to switch to an evo.

This is probably a really stupid question for some but....

Apart from looking more badass what is the benefit of using an 
Evo Falcon 40
https://landyachtz.com/product/evo-40-falcon

Over something like the 
Switchblade 40
https://landyachtz.com/product/switchblade-40-faded

To the uneducated the Switchblade has a more symmetrical shape and a slightly wider deck so would fit a bigger more even enclosure, looking at the attributes on the Landyachtz site the Switchblade has everything the Evo has except "racer" but also has some others the Evo doesn't. Makes it look like the Switchblade is a more all rounder board.
I have seen some builds where people use angled spacers to mount the trucks which I think is to bring it back to a more horizontal mounting plane for the truck baseplate.
I also don't see many other boards with the kicks like the Evo has.

Is the Evo just the weapon of choice for high speed builds but not the best for an all rounder ?

The evo easily clear 6" tires, wheelbite is basically impossible. Its very very low to the ground and the concave is extremely aggressive, its the most confident deck at speed i've ever ridden. I've accidentally been forced to jump (Board went up a little ramp) on mine at 30MPH and i stayed on it, its just so stable. 

Also the switch is better than the switchblade imo due to the concave and drop.

Does the new switchblade have any wheelbite issues with 6in pneumatics?
```

Makes sense, I didn't even think about wheel bite, most of the Evo builds I had seen seem to be on thane where I don't think wheelbite would be an issue.

I was thinking an Esk8 with 90mm thane and battery under deck.
I doubt either would have wheel bite issues and and the Evo being really low ceases to be a benefit if you have to run riser blocks to get enough clearance for the battery.

I've absolutely loved my evo. The new Falcon looks amazing! Personally though as mine is starting to show signs of love. I have started a mini project of making a carbon fiber clone with the goal to have the center hollow for my batteries and a stealthy look.![20190311_185934|243x500](upload://k4tv1jpiwPrBXkWrJdePPdu7hCq.jpeg)

Hell yeah this is the solution! Give me a week and you will see the best looking Evo for esk8 anywhere (subjectively, I may be biased ðŸ˜‚) it is getting a green Carbon Fiber skinned @bigben evo enclosure to top it off. Should be of the chizzle!

They are actually a steal at $135 out the door at muirskate, shipping included! I saw them in stock and two days later they were out of stock. They recently restocked and that is when I got mine. Unfortunately they also said they were out of stock again. Scott mentioned all the Esk8 guys were buying em up lol

And here is the @bigben Evo enclosure skinned in green CF with a Sender Skates logo (thanks @mmaner).  Ben's enclosures are the best, and I highly recommend them.  They are brick shit houses without the CF, it just adds some coolness.

Thanks guys!  It is my favroite so far too if I am being honest.

I have another fabric print of it (minus the mmaner avatar), and I am probably going to put it on the another evo and do another enclosure the same way and put it up for sale.  It just looks so damn right.

Just out of curiosity. I saw there are different length of EVO decks (not the 36'' ones)such as  39'' 40'' and 41''.

What's the difference with all those versions of length? Every couple year is different?

Where did they add/shorten the 2 inches from 39'' to 41'' and such? 

Are the enclosures fit all of them? For example, does @Eboosted DS 39'' EVO enclosure fit the 41'' deck?

I got a 2012 41'' one for 90 bucks. I measured it from tip to tip on the top of the deck. Do you think your enclosure would fit this one?
