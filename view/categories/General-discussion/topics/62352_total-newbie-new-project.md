Hey everyone, I‚Äôm going to build my first electric skateboard. I‚Äôve been doing lots of reading and there is some really interesting and helpful ideas on here. I was especially interested in @Namasaki build of 10s1p I‚Äôm thinking about building a 10s2p dual motored with the idea being of having a good power with a reasonable range (please correct me if I‚Äôm wrong) lol
So far I have purchased the board only![image|375x500](upload://mK97zDjq4wN9gH555KNItOHv7B0.jpeg)![image|666x500](upload://AvWzosoQ0I5hSwlGsSv2KznHeB1.jpeg) Thanks guys and look forward to seeing more projects and help

sweet deck, is it just a pool blank?
What size wheels do you plan to run?
Are you planning on running dual belt drive motors or dual hub motors? 
What do you consider reasonable range?

In my opinion, those mounts are not adjustable in belt tension. Go with single drive. So you would be better off spending 40¬£ on Calibers 2 from Bluetomato plus 50¬£ on @marcmt88 mount or @Boardnamics mount. And get a decent 6374 sensored motor.  
It will be plenty of power plus you only need one vesc

Unless your a heavier dude or going for speed records I personally don't think you need dual. I would put more money into buying a kick ass single drive, then upgrading to dual in the future.

Keep in mind it adds quite a bit of weight.

Shouldn‚Äôt be a problem as long as you have enough space under your board aaand choose a other kV for your motor.
If buy a vesc based on hw4.12, with 12s and 190+kV you could get over a erpm of 60000 which could blow up your vesc if you don‚Äôt limit it.
Better choose 150-170kV which gives you also a bit more torque

Great deck,  just the sort of thing I'm going with on my next one.  I'd go single satellite or dual hubs with that and stick to 10s with more in parallel.  More range less sag etc.  Thinking about it with the roads and pavements in the uk being what they are then probs the satellite with some crossovers would be the way forward.  I just like hubs on kickers only for the simplicity and durability on a board you are probably going to be hopping up kerbs etc.  anyway keep the thread going with your progress and good luck!

Thanks for all the comments and help much appreciated. So at the moment I went today to get a quote on painting the board ¬£60 (but I need to primer the board first)

I have also been doing a lot of reading and searching on forums etc I'm coming around to the idea 2 x 6s Lipos rated at 5000mah https://www.overlander.co.uk/batteries/lipo-batteries/lipo-batteries-5000mah-6s-22-2v-50c-ultrasport.html
With a dual motor 170kv 4000 watts each.
https://alienpowersystem.com/shop/brushless-motors/aps-6384s-sensored-outrunner-brushless-motor-170kv-4000w/

My question is has anyone mounted single motors front and back to create a dual motor setup? like this from youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zubc-UTdwo4

I agree with going for a single motor setup. For that size board it would be perfect and you could use the savings to get a larger battery. For me 10s2p doesn't offer enough range. That diyeboard enclosure has enough space for a stacked 10s5p + esc. 

Some people run diagonally mounted motors, and [ollinboards](http://www.ollinboardcompany.com/product/dual-esc-integrated-power-system-longboard-deck) mounts them that way so no problem- but might be for that particular deck.

FYI, I just finished a kicktail build and I had to use extended reverse motor mounts to get enough motor clearance from the ground.

Thanks for the suggestion @Static but I have looked at idea of mounting 2 motors diagonal but the posabilities are quite limited. I love the idea of having 2 motors but due to the board I have chosen I'm limited on space however I do like a good challenge and I wouldn't want to change the board.

If you put cells in series you need to connect + from one to - to other cell. In your diagram it looks like you connect +with + which would be a parallel connection.

If you make 3x 12s rows you cannot connect the bms so that it balance all cells.
You need to make 12x 3p packs to get the balance leads connected right

## \#44 Posted by: Andy87 Posted at: 2018-08-09T10:15:49.226Z Reads: 73

So you will not use a bms?
How you plan to connect the cells?
If you use nickel make sure you use multiple layers in your setup. If you go the 3row 12s way the current inbetween the parallel connection is higher. So a single layer 10mm .15 nickle wouldn‚Äôt be enough.

Sorry for the late reply. You need to reply to my question directly or add me, if no I don‚Äôt get notifications.
First thing I would change
Go like this: pack1- to pack2+, pack2- to pack3+ and so on. You now go like pack1- to pack2+, pack2+ to pack3-.
Hope you understand. Would draw it but don‚Äôt have anything to hand.
Second, you don‚Äôt need connections between level1 and 2. just draw your pack in one level laid out. Guess it‚Äôs more easy. Than fold it down after pack3 but don‚Äôt connect the levels. Make sure they good isolated from each other to don‚Äôt short.
```

---
## \#48 Posted by: Andy87 Posted at: 2018-08-09T23:03:02.259Z Reads: 69

```
With your latest layout it‚Äôs more easy. 
Inside one parallel pack you can use 8-10mm .015 nickle, to connect the packs you can use 2x12 awg wires or 3-4layer of the nickel should work too.
If you want to go with cell fusing than you need to use different nickel strips or fuse wires.
It‚Äôs more safe but bit more work.
If you interested search for cell level fusing in the forum. There some good explanations here

Read through the thread here
https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/help-with-charge-only-bms-wiring/5626?u=andy87
Usually the leads connected to the + instead of the main -.
If you buy a bms there should be a wiring diagram come with. They sometimes a bit different to wire up.

I guess you still have a small fault in your drawing. You should go like this:
![image|375x500](upload://br7pMEwrRDh3uSpsyPhpougHc0t.jpg)

Yes. The current should flow like an S through your packs. - + - + and so on. Or how else to sayü§îfrom the upper left corner from your pack to the down right corner, then turn around the next pack and from the left down to the up right and so on.

What exactly you don‚Äôt understand in it?
This would function great too and you don‚Äôt need to double the nickel as you have 3 serial connections for each pack. You don‚Äôt need to make the serial connection on the end corner of the pack. All parallel connections anyhow briged. Important is that you connect the right poles of each pack

Just came from a five hour trip to my next hotel and no time to look. Will have a look later this day when i‚Äòm free. But for the first it looks not so bad but the connection between your 3rows missing. At the moment you have 3 4s3p rowsüòâ

For to make everything more easy for you to understand you could just imagine every parallel pack like one cell. In fact it doesn‚Äôt matter for your diagram how much cells inside, one site is always plus, one is minus

It was a bit too much wires.
I crossed the connections you should skip.
The blue ones you need.
And green is your main + and - of your pack.

Don‚Äôt get this batteries. Everything with ultra super fire written on it usually fake.
Better use a trusted source like nkon.nl
The bms is for lipos. Means probably it will cut off your LiIon at 3.5v but you could discharge them till 3,0v. So that would take away about 30% of your range

For bms you could look for something like this if you want to use it for charge and discharge.
http://www.bestechpower.com/444v12spcmbmspcbforli-ionli-polymerbatterypack/PCM-D223V1.html

It also depends if you have enough space in your enclosure. If you don‚Äôt have enough space you could go with a charger only which is smaller.
In this case i would fuse the main circuit just to be safe.

I‚Äòm not the bms expert...guess @b264 could give you a good advice for a 12s LiIon bms.

Look for Samsung q30 batteries. They should fit good to your project

@Andy87 I originally looked at the Samsung 30q but they only had 3000mah that‚Äôs the only reason I was thinking others more towards to 5000mah and you are correct the bms I did choose was from before when I was going to run 2 6s lipos but it only made a 12s1p.

I doubt that in this cells 5000mah.
It‚Äôs not so easy to get so much in a 18650.
You can compare by your own, the higher the capacity the less a you can draw (the max at the moment i guess the Sony vtc6a with 3125mah and ‚Äû35a‚Äú constant (more like 20a constant)). But they quite expensive to compair what you get with the 30q
The 30q with 15-20a are still high drain and 3000mah it‚Äôs quite high.
With a 12s3p you should already get a good range.
What you expect or which range you wanna reach with your pack?

18-25km should be possible with your pack and q30.

If you need more range, add one more 12s but as I understood you don‚Äôt have more space.

Usually the bms is set to one input voltage.
If you use 2x6s bms it would mean you need two 24v charger or somehow get them in series but I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs possible and would work.
Try to get a charge only bms if you don‚Äôt have enough space, they smaller. To have a discharge protection just add a 58v fuse. Better than nothing

Dude is right, those ultrafire trusfire etc. Cells are big scam, those are actually 500mAh and max. Discharge current around 0.2A
Very often they're a cans with a very small battery and rest filled with sand.:

You could also consider ncr18650ga 3500mAh assuming 10A each is enough.
