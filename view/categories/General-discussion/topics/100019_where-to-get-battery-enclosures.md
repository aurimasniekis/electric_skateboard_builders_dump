12s hopefully 5 or 6p, was thinking of building my own enclosure, but if there is a good cheap alternative i would like to buy it, any reccomendations greatly aplreciated.

@psychotiller and @bigben sell enclosures.  There's many more that sell them too.

Lots of good diy enclosures if you use the search function.  You can do ABS, Fiberglass, Carbon fiber, etc...

This is a good one to start with

You can try searching on Ebay too. For example try looking up a 12s universal enclosure.
