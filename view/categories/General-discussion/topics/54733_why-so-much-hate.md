So today on my way back home from school some old motherfucking lady tried to spit on me for absolutely no reason. What's wrong with these people??

And then other times people would scream out cheater or some bullshit. Why the fuck are people such assholes?

Has this happened to any of you guys?

Humans are like that. There are no reasons for it. I'm surprised it was an old lady though. The cheating comment I've gotten, but I see it in a joke-ish comment.

I believe it was @mmaner who had a 2x4 thrown in his path?

I had some kids throw a soda at me out of their car window one night while I was on my esk8. 

They hate u, cuz they ain’t us. 

But the same thing happened once in a while on my bicycle. I think that anonymity inspires some folks to explore their worst inclinations. Knowing that they can “get away with it” facilitates the exploration of bad behavior. which is the definition of a shitty person. Their punishment is having to live with themselves.

Yep, that was me...  I'm honestly never surprised though.  If you've ever waited tables or worked a retail counter it becomes very clear very fast that world is full of ass hats.  Fortunately the world is also full of well meaning generous people, just gotta find them.  Being kind is an act or purpose, it doesn't happen by accident.

Almost got hit by a car that tried speeding in a street, but I was riding the speed limit in that street.
I ended up faling at the side of the road and he fleed.

Also had a guy tried to stop me, he was sitting in a regular city street at his front door. Probably thought I was driving to fast or to dangerous, but I was only riding 15 km/h because there were kids around... Didn't bother to stop and make a scene though. Just took the yelling and ride on.

My advice to you is don't react. By not reacting, **you** control the scenario...not them. Always live life on **your** terms. Take evasive action when needed by reacting with your reflexes and skill, but don't react with your emotions. The streets are not the place to find sympathy.

Example: last weekend I decided to open-up my board on a smooth section of road at Fisherman's Wharf in SF. Immediately after, I heard someone from the crowd yell, "cheater!!!". He was damn right...I was cheating physics and it was disturbing the programming in his feeble little mind. 

Number of fcks given: zero.

Shortly after that, a Honda Civic full of teen low-lives (you know the kind), attempted to smash me into the curb just before a right-turn at the intersection. I simply anticipated said assholery, leaned on my brakes, carved around their car, and then opened-up the accelerator. 

Number of fcks given: zero.

Well this past Friday my Skate got ran over by an asshat that decided not to stop at a cross walk. I had to bail out and he ran over the nose of my deck, deck flew like 15 feet in the air. The guy...ran over the deck, his front wheel kinda jumped up and he didn't even stop to see what happen! Just kept on going! 

Results are a cracked brand new Bustin Royce Pro deck and a bent front truck. I think my 90mm flywheel are intact. Still got to take it apart to do a damage control. Good thing is that i haven't electrified the board yet so it was still a regular push board. Even though, gotta drop have to drop like $150 to $200 on deck and new trucks. 

So yeah...people are assholes.

I live near a "rough school" and when I used to cycle to my school (a diffent one to the rough one) down a hill all the kids walking up the hill first started shouting at me which I didn't really mind, then they started to jump in-front of me while i was speeding down a hill on my bike at 35km/h at-least and I had to swerve onto the other lane and I almost went head on into a car this really annoyed me but what just stopped me from cycling all together was some scumbag spit bloody flem straight onto my hand it was so disgusting.

because of that I dont even try esk8 to school.

I dont understand why people do these things but unfortunately we'll never get away from them so its better to just ignore them I think

Don't let the trolls change the way you live.  Just ignore them.  Keep riding or doing whatever you need to do.

I also noticed how different people treat me:

A) when I have the helmet on with a gopro mounted on it
   versus
B) when I have the helmet on with no camera

You'd be surprised how everyone is so nice when they might be being recorded

I can't be the cool kid who doesn't react to bullys. I even go out help and fight back to them for others. I expelled few back in high school. 

To my defense I did nothing wrong riding community rd where just 2 cars using each lane. And one of them had to mess with me and follow and honk and dare to say not to ride in my town.

He is lucky I didn't grab my board and start hammering his window.

Last week, had some crazy lady honk and yell at my buddy and I while we were in the bike lane. My buddy yelled back at her and she slammed on her brakes and pulled into the bike lane nearly hitting us. 

To be honest, I was totally caught off guard. I’ve been very lucky and had almost no issues riding in my area, I just wasn’t expecting the random totally unprovoked anger. 

She stopped with her passenger side front tire inches from my board. I normally carry a pocket knife and if I’d had it with me, I’d have slashed her tire without a second thought. I actually went to grab it and remembered I left it at home. In hindsight, I’m glad I didn’t have it, she might have it coming, but I don’t want her bitching to the cops that would likely end up asking her what happened.

I see your point in some ways, but in high school your actions probably won't land you in jail, as you get older and continue to push back in this way, it also becomes a criminal act. Sure, you can go to court and explain this it to the judge and hope he reduces your sentencing or maybe your case gets dropped. But you lose time and legal fees. Sometimes, it's just best to let certain things go.

Think it's just a case of "vocal minority" (loud but small group) of both positive and negative things.  Mostly I'll get people who are cool and positive about it if they just see me in a restaurant or generally people walking/biking around (people who see drivers as the opposition I guess).  Have had people compliment me on the board or try to buy it off me or try to get me to build them one (without knowing anything about it), but I've also had a few negative encounters mostly someone hollering out the car window.

Strangely I'm in a fairly homicidal city yet haven't had anyone try to run me off the road (granted I keep to side streets as much as possible).

---

To add I also had a guy go the wrong way down a one way (following me) to ask me about buying it off me (was with his family who all seemed psyched about it was a pretty funny encounter)

I have more issues riding slow on the street then fast.

Just ride 35mph and under streets...and ride the speed limit. Stay off of main roads. It's pretty easy to avoid issues... If you can't go the speed limit don't skate on the street?

So you are asking why popele are assholes. Well shiat, let me grab a beer and dinner this is going to take a while.

No but in all seriousness, as soon as you enter the Orion Arm and first come up to the way marker of our solar system there is Earth, where you have to agree to the GTC to proceed:

" I hereby agree to expose myself to a harmful and toxic structure. Where the occupants despise all different ways of life (and life forms) that aren't the same as theirs. Ridiculing or aggressively opposing any rational discussion which doesn't comfort to their bias, would be the earthlings most prominent trait. So visitors must be aware that any form of decency, respect and sincerity will be violated based on your appearance and mode of transportation.

PS: We further advice visitors never to creat a situation where an earthling is forced into a state which is called "thinking", where they pretend to use their cognitive nervous system to produce an adequate solution to any given input, while confusing it with "truth".A principal we haven't yet been able to define.

I am sorry for my ramblings, but trying to study (philosophy/cosmology) and coming home after a night out is a hell of a combination. :slight_smile:

No I'm saying if your riding a 15mph street ride at 15mph or higher, remember speed limits are designed for a reason...  If your riding a 30mph street ride at 30mph. If your keeping up with traffic you can carve, you have less cars passing you making you have to abide to the narrow cycling lanes. Allowing people to pass and get upset, because you are disrupting the flow of normal traffic. If your keeping up to the speed limit of the street you ride, it works out pretty easy. 

I stay off of main roads that are 35mph and under Because typically it's heavy traffic and people are assholes. Otherwise do above and life will be a lot less stressful skating street.

If you can't do that... Stick to developments, greenways and sidewalks. The road is made for moving. If your in it you should be going with the flow of traffic or not on the street... Otherwise you are just putting yourself in more danger then riding with traffic, and would be safer on the sidewalk.

Regarding riding fast or slow I don't think it matters that much as long as you aren't in the way and are in control.  Personally I'll stop if I'm at an intersection and there's a red light and just walk or kick/push the board across the intersection once it goes green and basically stay between the actual lane and the walking path.  Usually by the time I kick my way across the intersection most of the cars have passed and I can get going back on electric powered.  

Agree on what Deckoz is saying too though just stick to streets that match generally the speed you're going to be going is ideal this way you don't have a ton of cars trying to get past you.  I only ride side streets or streets with bike lanes so long as it's an option, I'll walk it if the path I need to go down requires being on a major road.

Only thing I'd disagree with is the "option" to ride on the sidewalk since I tried that once while it was raining and got a warning/pat down from the police in Berwyn, IL (so see your local laws/enforcement for details).

That's called "aggravated attempted murder"

After that happens, you remain calm and
A) shoot her if the threat is still present (aka if she is hitting the gas again toward you)
AND (not or)
B) call the police and report the crime
C) remember her license plate as well.

Not doing B means you are just as at-fault as she is.  We have laws that say you may not try to murder people, and we have those laws for reasons.  They need to be upheld.

This is where being in Canada is awesome. I've gotten only a single "learn how to skate!" (though unbeknownst to him, I've been skating since I was 8, so joke's on him). Otherwise its entirely smiles, and "that's so cool". People love it.

im in canada too and the worst i had was a guy pull up to a stop sign while i was in the bike lane in my neighbourhood. I saw he was turning right so i waited for him take his turn and gestured him onward. he wouldnt move and kept honking at me...so instead of going straight through the intersection like i planned i hugged the right side of the road and took the right turn...he then proceeded to follow me around for the next 10 mins angrily yelling shit i couldnt hear due to wind. I lost him when i went into a park trail into the woods....

Only thing I’d disagree with is the “option” to ride on the sidewalk since I tried that once while it was raining and got a warning/pat down from the police in Berwyn, IL (so see your local laws/enforcement for details).
[/quote]

Guess this is gonna vary by area. I only use sidewalk if it is unsafe on the street and there is no other path.  Most officers understand that..and also understand it's transportation and not street skating/destructive, at least around me.

I pull over if there are people on the sidewalk...

Don't know about you guys but esk8 makes me happy.  cruising down the street strips away my cares faster than curry through a pisshead.  I'm absolutely incapable of anger.  This is the beauty of this wonderful hobby. On a serious note though, we are coming under scrutiny across the globe and some countries are banning esk8s so a low profile is advised, it only takes one or two incidents and everything is ruined for everyone.  
I'm from Queensland, Australia and they are a nanny state that will slap a ban on us as soon as look at us so please please curb your anger and just enjoy youselves.

all of us eventually have to deal with a mature woman (often younger than me) yelling and cussing at us because our boards scare them.

The only way to deal with that is ignore, go on and laugh at It.

IMO eskate, like all other newer technologies provokes a reaction. 

You must remember that for most people, when they see you skate past its probably the first time they have seen or even imagined an electric skateboard. Its probably quite a shock and often causes their brain to have to form an opinion very quickly on something they have never considered before. Depending on the first thing they think about it will be either positive or negative.

I also think that because of the disbelief of what they are seeing they usually feel the need to share this opinion with you and others around them, irrelevant of the current situation. Im sure anyone whos flown a lot of miniquads will agree that this is not just an eskate phenomenon .

This can bring out both the best and the worst in people. For every negative thing someone shouts there is another who shouts something positive. Its just human nature and its sad that people act so quickly without thinking about their actions but i dont think this is going to change any time soon. Idont think its hate, i think people are just quick to make snap judgments.

I could agree with this when I lived north of the Mason Dixon line. North Easterners are assholes (yea I'm a north Easterner, and was for 24 years). The people of the south don't act like this. It's few and far between. The city I live in is such a tech city that it's not out of the norm, my state has the largest greenway and biking system in the US. So all of this hate in foreign to me. Sure there's the one or two assholes, but the community of bikers, pedestrians, and skaters on the road here, is comparable to cars on the road. 

Sorry y'all have to deal with douches. Maybe you all should start fundraising, or talking with local companies to give dollars per sale to local government for greenway, safety and provisioning in your city. Just saying, you can change the face of your community. And people eat up the good of companies that support thier own local municipalities. It makes for positive business impact. There are things yall can do aside from bitch...

This is why I live in SF. Never had any bad comments or anything really. Just lots of people interested. The worst I've had is getting the stop sign first, just to have them cut me off and go. But then I just pass them real quick and what can they do? lol

I feel like the majority of the US is so bitter. People live miserable lives because they don't know how to find happiness. What they don't realize is they have just ignored their personal flaws, and instead of bettering themselves and fixing those flaws, they project their unhappiness that those flaws bring them on to others who have found happiness. In SF though, most people are better than this. Over 75% have at least a bachelors degree, which usually translates into a well paying job here. So why would they be bitter? They just look at us and tell themselves they make more money (whether true or not), and move on with their ego, lol.

She thinks people ride those because they are childish, stupid, poor or can’t afford cars (possible) she doesn’t see the congestion, lack of parking and fun aspects....in New York she took the taxi and walked, she refused to use the subway because that was for poor people.

For me, the way I ride really helps. Being keenly aware of people's potential fear/anxiety around powered popsicle sticks like these, I tend to ride overly cautious... Then gun it!

For example, riding by a park full of kids playing, mothers and father's watching said kids, grandparents wandering, cookouts and picnics abound, if I come within or anticipate coming within 50ft of someone on a sidewalk, I slow to a near dead stop.... You could walk the pace I go down to as i'm passing by. I show a big smile (as this shit is really fun), I wave, and almost every time (I don't remember a time where I didnt) get a reassuring/confident/interested smile wave and greeting back. 

These parents in the park, grandparents wandering, and children playing see me, that I'm being responsible, not trying to be dangerous, yet when the coast is clear I take off... Fast, but not too soon. I get my space first. But with these people still in sight, as I zip off faster than the speed of light, I can tell from the looks in their faces "here is a man being overly cautious and responsible, but truely having a blast, and that looks fun, I want to try it". The kids are enamored. The parents want one of these rocket sticks. The grandparents seem to think "don't have too much fun!".... Instead of "get off that damn skateboard!" from the looks in their faces.

Maybe I haven't been riding long enough, but even longboarding over many years, this tends to be the case, so long as you are aware of your surroundings, are cautious when riding, open to listening to and actively anticipating the concerns of others and adjusting yourself and your riding to accommodate this on all of the roads and paths you ride on.

Then again, there will always inevitably be that one person though, that just won't have it. I don't have an answer for that guy or girl... But when you get stuck in a situation with that guy or girl, a cop will probably side with them so try to avoid that situation/person at all costs.

Try the suburbs of Cali, where I'm at. Full of arrogance and loads of people here didn't even graduate high school. Those that end up with college degrees, leave for greener pastures.

I haven't finished my build yet but I'm anticipating lots of asshat-ery, attempted thefts, death threats and murder attempts, and just plain old ignorance when I do start riding around.

SF...people only gave a shit about bikes, skateboards, or scooters was if you were riding them really bloody fast on the sidewalk, which was a BIG no-no back when I was living there.

It's ridiculous how people view everything as some sort of symbol of social status. A car is just a tool to get from point A to point B, with it's own list of pros and cons. A skateboard is another tool to get from point A to point B, with it's own list of pros and cons. Etc, etc.
Those that see beyond the social status bullshit and treat it as it is, bullshit, are so much better off for it.

When I first started eboarding in 2014 I rode around a park in my neighborhood that had a skatepark with a lot of typical teenage skaters. I would hear them talking amongst each other saying "thats gay" when they saw me. I understood where this was coming from.  It's a different philosophy of "trick" skating, respect is earned by being able to pull off complicated tricks.  A dude that's pushing a button to move their skateboard goes against that trick culture.

You can live here under a few circumstances:

- live in the same house as a bunch of other people,preferably your friends, with your own room, having found said place through a friend (my situation and most people I know).
- Craigslist and get lucky with an in law room (happened to me once also)
- Work in tech and pay through the nose (likely my future with my new degree in CS and my landlord issues lately)

Other wise, it's impossible. Forget 50% of the city before even looking for a place through a friend because those places are for overpaying tech workers only.

Ive had so many drivers seize the opportunity to cut me off/hit me. Only bumped into two cars now, nothing bad yet...Alot of drivers will speed by, clearly jealous :slight_smile: 
 Always stay alert on the roadway, drive courteously, and wear protection!
The police in Massachusetts loveee my E-board, many stop me just to get a closer look! 
They clearly show a lack of jurisdiction around the subject, but i know theyll confiscate it no sweat, so I always slow down and ride on curbs when I see the coppers, and watch for cars in general..
So far, so good!!!
I want to give eboarders/eriders a good name, so I never give the middle finger.
(the only defense besides an M1 garand and spit)
I just speed onto the nearest curb and choose a different route if drivers are being stupid.

A prius isn't made for offroading (but can) and an offroading truck isn't made for gas mileage (but can possibly get better gas mileage depending on how you drive...)

Just like you _could_ ollie an e-board, and you _can_ bomb a hill or go fast on a shortboard.  But just like you can't even come close to getting the gas mileage of a prius in a truck even if you tried, you can't really bomb up a hill on a shortboard, even if you tried.

You need that electric component to make it that much better. Guess what car I drive.

 When dude charges at you, screaming its his sidewalk and acting violent, i think politely telling him to go fuck himself and to back away from you in an aggressive tone so you can ride away is better than fighting a guy

Concealed carry in a state with laws favorable to defending yourself or others in situations of fear in the face of deadly bodily harm, unlike CA where you can only meet your assailant with equal or lesser means of force, could be a good way to deal with crazy violent people... Totally not advocating for carrying a gun to shoot random or just randomly angry people, but it doesn't hurt to be prepared incase you find yourself in a deadly situation because of some crazy aggressive/violent person that _for some reason wants to kill you over you riding an e-board...._   ???

Just saying, you can legally carry a gun most places. While brandishing it is illegal, and it's smart to know when and how you can legally defend yourself... it doesn't hurt if it means the difference between either speeding off, being murdered by a crazy person trying to diffuse the situation, or having your vescs die and being stuck in a bad situation. ;P

I don't carry a gun when I skate- way too unwieldy.

I feel you. From my subjective perspective, I feel like we are somewhere between professional cycling, and skateboarding (street skaters). If that's truly the case though, something makes me think we are going to be okay. We need to stay vigilant though.... them laws ...

 Then again we could just resort to our "outlaw" skateboarding roots and just keep on riding anyways. I don't want to though, we are _mostly_ adults, right?

To be fair I think everyone who’s response is gun would probably do so in any situation involving defending themselves, its more of a culture thing and not so much about the image of the sport.  My rule is if i can speed away safely then do so,  Half the reason i got into this hobby was to leave people in the dus watching as i skate away. They know that the only thing that comes close tocMarty Mcfly is us Esk8ers. Besides, i got a kid to get home to

Same here man. I'd like to respectfully disagree with you on the gun portion though. I don't carry around a gun when I skate because like you said, the marty mcfly stuff! 

But if I am taking my wife and kid around to a sketchy part of town or whatever, I want to be able to defend them, protect them. 

For me, I am a super pacifist... it has nothing to do with culture, gun culture or anything like that. I just don't want me, or worse my family, caught in a situation we can't get out of because I didn't apply for the permit and train on safe handling or forget to take it knowing i'm taking my family out somewhere that is statistically more likely to end us up in a situation where a tool like that _could_ come handy if the situation deteriorates to the **worst-case-scenario** (ie, you have an armed assailant putting you or your family at risk of death, period). This is super off topic though. 

To get back on topic, 100% just speed away, I was mostly just making fun of the whole thing :sunglasses:

Somebody might find this interesting:

Riding around a few days ago I was going on my normal route along the sports park in my town, slowing down for pedestrians and such like I normally do. There is one point along the sidewalk where a lot of people park to open up there cars and take things out (like a blanket and food or a picnic, for example). 

I was going along that area at about 10mph due to pedestrians when some little yip-yip dog jumps out in front of me. I was very alert and came to a complete stop, without harming the dog (keep in mind this little pillbug had ran in front of me and started barking). The owner of the dog, some guy probably mid-50s gives me a scolding that I couldn't hear because it was windy and I had me helmet on. 

By the time I hopped off the board and took off my helmet to hear him a bit better, the only thing he had left to say was "You should put a leash on that thing you idiot! You could be paying the vet bills for my dog!". 

My response: "If you put a leash on your dog like this park requires, this wouldn't be a problem"

Moral of the story for that guy: 
This is my park. I grew up here, I know the ins and outs of every turn and field. If you're going to give me a hard time, better make sure I did something wrong first.

I guess they have a better way to hit over 20 mph on flat ground.

People look for reasons to start shit. Most of them are all talk. When I do ride on sidewalks, I know that it can be startling to fly past someone too close. So I’ll either take the time to annoyingly stop and slowly get around them or I’ll make sure I’m on the far opposite side of the sidewalk. One time I’m riding in West Hollywood with a nice wide clear sidewalk. I pass a guy that is on the completely opposite side going probably about 15. He “hey you fucking faggot”. The weird thing is, this is the heart of gay town, you can tell instantly that I’m likely straight, and that he was likely gay. Well regardless of how inaccurate the insult was I stopped, and tried out my reverse function. Long story short, he was a puss, not willing to back up his shit. People just don’t like other people traveling faster than them.

I’ve fell multiple times because of this, and it’s rude and annoying, and dangerous af. I don’t recommend this, but now when people intentionally do this, I simply hit them full power, not caring if I fall in the process, because they need to understand how dangerous it is. 😭 maybe I’m as ahole for this, but to me I justify it as, if you want to get hit then you’ll get hit.

the only two times I've been yelled at were the first time I rode the finished board (it was night time and did not have lights on yet, I had to make a little detour from the bike lane on the street, so I stopped and checked if I were safe to do so and an upcoming moped driver on said street told me he could not see me and he realized I was on the side of the street at the last moment, so he stopped by and suggested me to get some lights, which I did) and that one time I was riding with my backpack fully opened and a visible MacBook Pro inside :smiley:

Idk how I feel about this... I feel like she was somewhat justified in her anger. You were smack dab in the middle of that street (the one without the bike lane) slowing down traffic. 

I hear "thinking they own the street" a lot but sharing the street works both ways, forcing traffic to drive behind you on an esk8 doesn't seem right. I think the correct thing would've been to ride closer to the side to let them pass or go on the sidewalk until you come to a street with a bike lane.

Having also been a driver before, theres nothing more infuriating than driving behind a biker cruising along at 10mph in the middle of a one lane street with no safe way to pass. It might technically be legal for you to do so but do you really want to test some random road ragers patience when you're on a motorized piece of wood up against a 2 ton block of steel? Is a permanent bodily injury worth a court settlement payment?

Food for thought

I was thinking about this today when I took a run to the store for some groceries. I mostly ride on sidewalks, because most of the roads around me are pretty busy. My board can get up to 37mph or so... which is perfect for the 35mph roads around here, but I think i'd rather push the speeds in the safety of my own "lane" on the sidewalk. I might start using the bike lanes more often though..

The reason I am replying to you right now is this: it's a cold, dreary day out today here, so I was going pretty quick on some bike paths. Up ahead, I saw a family, dog... kids, mother and father. I immediately started full brake, but I was going *really* quick. The wife was frantically trying to corral the dog, the dad was just staring at me... probably thinking "cool"... but the wife seemed frazzled seeing me hurling towards them while trying to corral the kids and dog...

I held my hands up to motion that I was coming towards them to please step aside incase I didn't come to a full stop in time... well... they corralled in the middle of the sidewalk instead of off into the grass. but probably just not thinking, just responding (irrationally, which I guess is normal when frightened).

Either way, I came to a full stop before I reached them, and navigated between the kids, dog, etc slowly. I apologized for freaking them out real quick with a smile and a "sorry", and drove off at a bit more reasonable speed. 

I am glad to know how fast I can brake, be able to look ahead and go only the speed I know is clear. 

But this brings me back to your point. The sidewalks and pathways imo should probably be for pedestrians. I'm going to make it a thing to make it out into the bike lanes more often, or at least when I have to take a path try to not frighten families walking their kids by riding at a reasonable pace (maybe 15-20mph). 

I don't want to be irresponsible, don't want to get hurt, or worse end up being that guy that hurts someone else on the road or sidewalk. I'll try to save the speed for clearer roads, more open paths or relatively isolated areas.

IMO, if there's a bike lane and your riding the sidewalk...trouble is waiting to happen. I understand there are reasons, buy if something happens on the sidewalk and there is a bike lane available it will be your fault regardless.  

I do it myself.  The bike Lanes in Podunk Alabama are crap, mostly the sidewalks are too, but they are better than the bike lanes.  Just know that when you hit someone it's your ass that will be at fault not matter the scenario if there's a bike lane and your not in it.

Just remember you are operating a motor vehicle, and will be held liable if you hit someone.

Dogs are truly a wildcard. Never know if they are gonna be completely cool and not even look your way, start barking at you or head straight for the board/legs. Personally I usually slow down and try to pass with no or very little throttle, as the whine from the BLDC must be much more audible to them.

Another problem with going to court over something like that is even if one doesn't get jail time, in some places certain judgments can suspend one's right to carry things like knives, pepper spray, and other personal defense items...especially if one used such an item during the incident.
The point I'm getting to is save major reactions for things that are truly defense/safety critical.
Of course, if you're in a place that doesn't allow you to carry tools for personal defense anyway, the suspension point is moot.

Yeah. strangers responding irrationally and even way-over-the-top anger seems increasingly common; even more than just a year or two ago. Even folks nowhere near your path may surprise with what they do...like waiting until you pass by and then throwing dangerous things (e.g. rocks, bottles) at you from behind. Weird.

Just remember that a cam can also be used against you...as can your phone's GPS, and the data any esk8 app may be recording (speed, location, acceleration, direction, etc) with convenient timestamps for the lawyers. The more sophisticated the app, potentially the more data may be available to either support or contradict your memory of the events.

Example: Data like "speed" at time of impact (which could be shown with "acceleration" and "location" data), could be used to sufficiently prove extreme negligence/recklessness which can cause financial damages awards to be vastly increased. In a courtroom there's a big difference between a witness saying "He seemed to be going kinda fast." and your own app showing you were going "32mph" at the time you hit a pedestrian.

Miami hasnt been too bad, i had one "lazy" comment from a bunch of old men drinking beer on their porch i just thought it was ironic.

also more recently I had some old guy on a golf kart yell at me and told me to slow down maybe? i dunno i sped off. Its best to never stop for people that yell just keep going, problem is when i see another eskater in the wild i usually yell at them to get their attention and they usually do what i do keep riding lol.

When i do night rides on south beach i carry because it can be quite dangerous in the city that late. My buddies battery died on a bridge and we were stopped for a few min before i was going to tow him back. I noticed a guy come from the shadows and was walking towards my friend from behind the guy stopped when i yelled out and my friend turned around and the dude ran away, he got really close and never said a word it was really creepy.

Interesting experience this weekend, was going fairly quick down a cycle path when approaching a woman, her baby buggy and her friend, taking up the entire pah - now here's the odd part I started some slow down carving (training foot break hardcore, i don't use my breaks at all right now), I can only assume she thought I was 'going side to side to piss her off' so suddenly she starts to mirror my carving...I stopped carving and she kept moving in-front of me I had to pretty much stop to get past safely.

Wow I thought she's using her baby as a weapon against a random eboarder, would hate to be married to her lol

I'm in SF, CA. Been an average street skater since I was young, and I've now gotten into eskating. About a month ago, one person told me to, "Do a kickflip" on an electric longboard with no tail. I tried to not let it get to me, lol. 

Then, just today, as I was riding down a hill in GG park, there were two people that I had seen earlier; one on a bmx and one on a regular longboard. I was going downhill at about 25mph, the guy on the bmx was in the middle of the road, he saw me proceeding left, and he literally kept moving closer and closer to the left, as if he was trying to run me off the road. I kept going, with a few inches of road to spare. I don't know if it was intentional or what, but I'm definitely open to the possibility that there are petty fucks out there that would do harm for basically no reason whatsoever. If I ever see this fool in GG park and he pulls that shit again I'm going to ram my fist straight into his face at 30mph, I don't give a fuck (and I have armored gloves to boot).

That's why we see lots of vids of crazy pedestrians and car crashes in countries like Russia... they got extreme laws to defend pedestrians, at a point where all sort of crazy people now try to jump in front of cars to mimic being hit so the insurance companies pay them loads of money based in these extreme pedestrian protecting laws; now almost everybody with a car there carries an inboard camera to protect themself from these intentional scamming schemes. The result, all type of other car related events being recorded, car crashes, highway semi truck collisions, road rage, fights, irresponsible pedestrians, crazy maniacs, mad street crossings and even astronomical events like meteorites falling from the sky. All recorded on camera. Russia is f... crazy!!

I never really understand the hate. I get that people at times draw associations between things and as a result of these associations, everything within this relationship is given the same treatment (I.e Movie Theaters not allowing Skatebaords no matter the electrical variety) but these things has **value**

They’re practical and they’re getting more practical every year with each new innovation and milestone. And once battery technology takes that needed leap, these things are going to be the future.

I read an article just now that , we’ll *disgusted* me. Half because I can feel the author is reading this to get paid and half because I know people will use this reconfirm their own prejudice against us. I’ll quite It below so that no one has to go over to the site and give her revenue. 

> Everything is stupid, and so are we. Welcome to Jezebel’s Stupidest Summer Ever, a season-long celebration of our worst, most idiotic thoughts and opinions.

> I have always loved skaters.

> I remember going to the now defunct indoor skatepark at my hometown mall as a tween to watch cute older boys and even cooler, but fewer, girls from my town skate, grasping at the chain-link that lined the border of the substantial maze of half-pipes and rails, and wincing as floppy-haired teens wiped out to the music of The All-American Rejects.

> At home I’d watch Jackass and the underrated MTV show Scarred, the latter of which chronicled the worst injuries amateur skateboarders have ever endured, and would become morbidly infatuated with skate battle scars; broken bones and stitches galore. Part of skating, I thought, was to surrender your whole, stupid body over to the art form and its dangerous whims. Teens who skated were putting themselves in mild danger, which was insanely cool, of course.

> But you know what isn’t insanely cool? Grown ass men riding electric skateboards.

> Listen, I don’t know where they came from, I just know that they’re everywhere right now. Several times in the last few months I have walked the streets of New York City and seen a posh older dude skating, almost too smoothly, perhaps with the purr of a small motor, holding...a remote? And every time I’ve died a little bit inside from embarrassment.

> But you know what isn’t insanely cool? Grown ass men riding electric skateboards.﻿
I’m no skater, nor expert. I am merely a fan of the sport (and a judgmental woman with loud opinions who gets paid to write about them.) And I’ll admit that from what I’ve read, electric skateboards seem like a completely different activity than the non-battery operated original. For one thing, it doesn’t seem like you can do any crazy tricks in them (“You can slide on the board but take care that you don’t abuse the board in a way that will void your warranty,” the FAQ for one brand reads) which is lame! They’re also extremely expensive, running hundreds of dollars.

> The image of a man, say, in his 40s or 50s casually taking up skateboarding for the first time can be disconcerting to some, especially because it so often screams: “I am desperately trying to feel 25 again and also do you want to come back to my Dumbo loft and listen to Flipper.” So if that’s already cringe-inducing, please imagine that exact same scenario except he’s not even trying to learn to skate—he’s buying a motorized board (read: scooter without the handles) to do all the work for him. So, am I going to side-eye some high-schooler in Brooklyn zipping by me on one of these? No. All I ask is, please consider if you’re going to look like an asshole on your $700 electric skateboard, because you probably will.

> I found some solace in this thread titled “Are dudes on electric skateboards considered kooks by other skaters?” as well as a video from YouTuber and skater John Hill who asked a bunch of sponsored skateboarders he knows for their opinions on electric boards. Responses included “thumbs down emoji,” “seems convenient for getting around for lazy people,” and “they’re probably really convenient but not the coolest looking thing.”

> True that. Get a real board, dweebs!

Well fuck us for wanting convince.

That pathetic excuse of an article is ridiculous. I used to skate, my commute from home to high school was 3 blocks. I got yelled at by the narcs all the time when we skated after school. On the weekends I hung out at skate parks getting dirty and sweaty. In college it was awesome being able to travel around campus at three or four times the speed of walkers. Skateboards make great seats and foot rests in class too. 

Analog skateboards have a purpose and it’s fun but I t’s used for short travels/commutes and tricks, not for the distance and speed we travel at or awesome group rides. 

Sure some people were never skater before this. But that goes for everything. That’s like looking down on a guy on a motorcycle while one a bicycles and calling him a dweeb...then my three year old looks at that bike guy and calls him a dweeb.

Quite frankly, I highly doubt they're really a fan of the skateboard/longboard scene in the first place (they don't even know how much a good, solid skateboard or longboard costs for instance). Just ignore ignorant dumbasses like that. You'll be better off for it.

I always wondered though...all this shit people post on the internet thinking there aren't any consequences...someone should dare all these guys to stop being chicken shit and go up to the people they're talking about and tell them their opinion straight to their face.

The average person is resistant to change and respond in hateful and disrespectful ways.

Why?

Because change means having to adapt. To adapt means to learn. To learn for most people means taking risks and that entails making mistakes occasionally. And most people HATE to make mistakes. Too much pride and not enough humility. And as a result, they lash out.

A guy whipped a beer bottle at me recently, funny I decided to veer off around a pole right when he threw it so he missed like the drunk jealous a-hole he was. I was in the zone having safe fun in full gear, and thought he was following and enjoying the look of the board like most ppl do. 
Nope, he was lining up his shot for 1/4 mile and misses like a dumbass. 

I gave him the finger after seeing and hearing the glass, he was speeding away when I did no scratches but i felt it. 
Next time hit me a-hole!, prove a point or move the F on. Pull over and explain what I did wrong if i got in your way, but rarely do I do so, and I always stop, wave, or apologize when I do make a traffic error.
My gear was looking mighty fresh that day, yellow tires, Fast new drive and flashy orange full face, He must have been so jealous!!! I even had some punks try to grab my board out of mcdonalds once, little f***s. 
Respect the hobby, respect traffic laws, and then remember your better than these whackos Ive mentioned.

I've read figures for older people on electric kick-scooters getting seriously injured took a huge spike upwards in the last few years as the the scooters became cheaper and more available. Unpowered scooters too, as some cities are apparently providing them in trials as alternatives to public bicycles.
