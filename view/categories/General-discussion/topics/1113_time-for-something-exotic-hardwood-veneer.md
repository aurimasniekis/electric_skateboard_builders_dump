Did our first pressing of exotic woods this evening. This Teak should look nice under some clear gloss. I have been wanting to try this for a very long time!

This is tempting. I love the idea of using exotic veneers for the face layers.

Definitely the lux treatment! Those Arbor decks are sweet! You keeping it Flintstone or going electric?
