Ths issue with travelling at the moment with lithion ion batteries higher than 99Wh for some airlines. 
What can we do? 
Can we put these things in a fire safety slip bag. 
I was thinking just present the battery fully discharge.  Is there an easy way to discharge spacecell without having to run motors. Some other accessory we could plugg it into to fun it down overnight before leaving.  High output light or something. We could use the light. 

 Ok to ride till dead at home before you travel
 Might not be so easy while away and time as your always in a rush when travelling/hols. 
-Definately relabel battery mobiliy battey snd change Whr rating. Could be accessory battery.
