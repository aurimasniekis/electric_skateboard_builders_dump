After a long reflection, I finally decided that I should tell this story on how I got scammed buying a used board here on the buy and sell section. I never received it neitheur my money

The main reason to write all of this down is because I want to share my experience so this doesn’t has to happen to somebody else and because there is still a little hope that I will get my money back...
In November I contacted MarkeyScott (username) because I was interested in his Board.
Here is the selling thread still online:
https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/murdered-esk8-build-f-s-obo-218mm-375/37305
After some very good a fast communication he offered me to add a second motor to the board to build me my dream set-up.
He would build fast and ship it out to me in France.

To not get scammed I paid using PayPal goods and services. He replied promptly to let me know that unfortunately he can’t withdraw the money from PayPal for a month's time that he even called the consumer service of PayPal. The reason why he can’t withdraw would be because it was not sent as friends and family.
So he gave me the choice either to wait a month for the money to release so he could pay the motor from my money or refund me the money and I will send by friends&family and he could start building right away. 
He was very responsive and even accepted to send me a picture of his Id- card (which I am willing to add to the post if this can help)
 He still seemed very serious and  trustworthy

After sending him the money he still replied, but not as fast as before, he kept telling me he had lots of work to do at the hotel as he would work as a hotelmanager and would finish the board on weekends. This went on until the end of December, he even told me twice he would just need to do some testing before sending the board off tomorrow which he of course did not do.

Mid December he told me that one motor broke and he would need to buy a new one, he sent me pictures of a new motor a week or so after the presumed old one broke, I have been texting him on a very regular basis since then with very lacy replies.

During the Christmas season he did not reply anymore to tell me in the beginning of January that his car got broken into and he and my board got stolen. But he assured me he would get money from the insurance.
He offered me to either build me a new board or give me the money back. I went for the second option which has not happened until today!

Every 10 days or so he does answer to tell me I would get some money right away through PayPal as I need it and pay me all of it back when the insurance does pay.

I never got a dime back from the guy and as I see how strong and honest the Esk8 community I got hope that somebody might know, dear MarkeyScott and tell him to send the money back to the student guy really needing his money.

Thanks!

I am sorry for your loss :/ hope it gets resolved soon!

Just to throw this out there for others to be aware, I was researching this when I was setting my shop with PayPal and **there is no such thing as money being seized because of the way that they have been sent. That is for either side (seller and buyer).**
Some reasons that the money could be seized is for suspicious activity which includes things like complaints from customers about a certain account, "unexpected" income so if you have an account that receives a payment from time to time and suddenly you receive big or bigger amounts of money that can alarm paypal to freeze your funds until they are sure you are not stealing or such...

Everyone needs to stop using friends and family. Only time you should ever use friends and family is when you send your mom or dad money lol. Im sorry this happened to you and it really gets under my skin when people scam people but this is the reason I will never use friends and family ever ( unless you're a close friend and I know where you live :) ) I'd rather wait or pay the extra fee just to send money as goods and services then get burned because unfortunately some poeple are scumbags. Hope you can get the police involved and you have all the back and forth messages saved.

PayPal will most of the time freeze the money till you either gave a tracking id or 30 days has been passed, I recently bought a board of a guy here I had to manuelly press confirm before he would get the money and I also recently sold some motor to a guy nearby I had/have to wait 30 days for the funds to be released I asked paypal and they simply told me it was due to my account not being used enough, they want 100 dollars to be sent or recived a month before they remove this limit. 

Its simply just so PayPal cant lose any money due to chargebacks or scams.

In my opinion I don't think its friends and family it's more like don't take friends and family if they have less than 80 days. 4 days in wanting to sell something is really fishy. I've bought many things and sold many things here never had a issue. Only issue I think I had is when I tell them I'll ship in 2 days and they worry but I got a life sooo things happen .

I personally think friends and family would be fair to cover the shipping since not everyone can afford to pay the shipping outright, but the entire price of the board never.

F/F is prone to be bad for both.

Someone should start a thread on names of trusted sellers on the forum amd exclude those people with a website. Only those who use the forum may be even include those that aren't trust worthy even their full Name. Idk just a thought

Yeah, I'm gonna say no to that.  There are a couple of vendors here that I have purchased from literally dozens of times.  Sometime up to $600 - $800 per order.  Why waste their money on fees?

There is so little profit margin in standard esk8 gear that its irresponsible to cost a vendor 3% just for the hell of it. 
 Some people are trustworthy, some are not.  For those people that have made hundreds of transactions without a blip, I would suggest its a waste of money to pay the fees.  For new sellers, F&F is definitely NOT the way to go.

EDIT:  In fact, I recently got a royal screwing when paying someone on the forums by specifically NOT using F&F.  His paypal account got help, or so he said, and he couldn't get to the money.  He waited almost a week to refund the money, by that time it had crossed into a new billing period on my credit card so I got the pleasure of paying interest on a $1000 that he sold to someone else.  Cost me $120.  

The lesson here is be careful who you buy from, reward those sellers that practice good business, be leary of new sellers until they have proven themselves.

I'm just going to clear a few things up...

1) It is not against forum rules to use friends and family with individual transactions in PayPal (though it is frowned upon)

2) it is strongly advised to use goods and services w/ PayPal 

3) @Lambjr088 @Pingo03 the moderators are currently working on compiling a list of trusted sellers on the forum, these sellers will be aloud to conduct group buys regardless of their level

Yeah don't get me wrong there are good guys out there where you could probably trust your money with them but at the end of the day 3% can be split between the two parties and it would save a lot of headache. Especially on $500+ orders

I sold something here (board brake) and just said please include the 2.15 got PayPal fee and 2.37 shipping and gave my PayPal for payment. 

I figured they would send as goods and services. But they sent as F&F. Figured the 2.15 was a tip of trust since it was sent F&F.

Shipped the next day. Got delivered never heard from the guy again lol. @Jreamer

A list with trusted sellers will help on this forum but you will have to sell a lot of stuff to proof your honesty but it might be a good solution to prevent people like me to lose 600usd to a complete stranger and probably never get the proper Eskate you wanted because the money for it got stolen

The username you better not buy from is MarkeyScott
The name on his presumed Id is: Mikey Scott Villagimez
And email adresse used on PayPal: 
aarre2241@stu.wusd.org

To make a propper police report I need as much information of the guy as I can get, maybe the moderator do have more information about him? And please delete his account/thread so he can’t do the same on here anymore maybe he even scammed more people with the same board!

ok so here's the plan. 

we all meet up at midnight at Del Taco. I would say Taco Bell, but the point is to not be seen by anyone. And i need tacos and mountain dew or i can't go through with it, i'll just fall asleep in the van. 

then we get a van. best to just steal one and cake mud on the plate '70's style. 

so then we van the guy, black sack and all, and make him answer a bunch of existential questions about chicken sandwiches until he cries for a dead god to save him and loses his shit. 

then we hand him a shovel and make him dig a hole while blindfolded and ear-muffed on public property while somebody reports a hole digger to the cops, and while he's blindfolded and digging we sneak off and leave a bunch of signs saying he's digging for his conscience. Then the cops show up and find a crazy distressed guy in the middle of a performance art piece on public property that involves destruction of public property and put the whole thing on youtube from behind a tree.

sorry for all that live in GA... but Atlanta is a HUB for scammers... my banker even told me so after my shit got hit last week.

sooo... i'm game for some tacos and i'll even bring my own shovel...

i'll hand delivery pulleys to @GrecoMan and swoop him up...

i'll bring what ever color paint and my paint sprayer for @RedEagle  bus...

dry it ou on way to pickup LHB and proceed with the run down...

NOTE; we'll stop for eSK8ers and only politely ask once "to get the "F" on the bus

after that i would suggest, since we have bus, just drive that on over to Esk8con :yum:

If this is Alex Arreguin, the kid needs to put in a jail cell.  And at least his parents and school and community knowing they are living amongst a thief.

There's enough room for people _and_ their boards. There's also a bar if you feel so inclined.
Anyone up for a drink? Slumber party? Trip to Skatan's lair?

funny you should say that.. I am writing a book. 

i just sent my Danger Manual to the printers, but I have been working on my esk8 autobiographical tome for a few months now, just trying to dump the stream of consciousness into text so i can re-organize it later. Once i get that up to a reasonable content level and edited, i'll probably self publish it as well. 

The danger manual will be available for purchase, you won't have to order a board to get it. I'll probably make a t-shirt and sticker bundle for it as well.

His Facebook is daily easy to find. It’s the fact that he’s a minor that makes It hard to pursue, multiple attempts have been made to contact people in his life to No avail. A police report is really the best step but no one wants to pursue it. And no one can unless their a victim (I mean you probably could , but why allot that time and money to something that you won’t get anything out of personally)

It probably is time to get the police involved at this point. I mean i get it when he started that company and took orders and it was a school project and all that then just engaged in rampant bamboozlry as a minor who maybe possibly by some stretch didn't know what he was doing and it got out of control. but the lessons should have been learned by now.  It seems to be continuing.

If this really is alextech that scammed you: @Pingo03 i highly suggest you file a police report. Alextech knows exactly what he's doing at this point(if he's still scamming), and so do the adults around him....

A police report needs to be filed by victim.  Try Going online and look up STATE/County where supposed dude is at/lives...

I would advise anyone else who has been scammed by this guy and if true is same as AlexTech... make your own police report... power in numbers gets results.
