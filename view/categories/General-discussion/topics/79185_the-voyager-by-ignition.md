I'm very familiar with the esc I just didn't know that Hobbywing made it.  They make some damn fine rc stuff.

Thats not the same as the normal shit esc that diye sells.  Meepo styly.  Looks different and I have used the hobbywing rc stuff for years with great results.  The board is still shithouse though and the website is full of lies and deceit.

Hobbywing does make fine stuff as I'm pretty sure exway usues a custom engineered esc from them

I'm sure they changed it. That's why starting from wowgo and onward their ESC was upgraded.

Exway definitely does the most upgrade and engineering over the other Chinese brands.
