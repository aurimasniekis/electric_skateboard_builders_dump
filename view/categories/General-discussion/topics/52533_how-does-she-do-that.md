Yep, the road seems bumpy in the middle and she is on the other side of the "bump" (compare to the viewer) but all 4 wheels are on the ground, for me.

Basic optical illusion, as benjamin said just above

It happens to me a lot, and if you don't have dual drive system you will hate when it happen.
Just lean back when you making a turn and it will happen to you too.

When you lean very hard into a turn the board will lift up after some time. you cannot glue the wheels to the tomach. 
I only loose the traction of the outer wheels when i went 3kmh and made a tight turn.
Oh, and last time my front outer wheel just lifted up, by a damn Little rock...., in a 40kmh curve. Scary but gladly i did not fall and just cruised along
