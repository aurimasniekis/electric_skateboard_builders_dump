I have to say that the nano gear drive is pretty efficient to set and stay in place (imo)...

Unik got good one too for belt drive.

I tried a few and the best I found is this https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/whoosh-motormounts-for-caliber-tb-surfrodz/ the fixed version with the crossbars 

Price is steep tho.
