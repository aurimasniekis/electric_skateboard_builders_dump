My orange kegels are starting to look a little gnarly. Any recommendations on how to clean them?

You can wash then without any detergent in the dishwasher. If it doesn't satisfy you, add detergent
Because of people can boil them to die them, then dishwasher will not harm them

dishwasher, easiest thing in the world.  My wife looks at me crazy when I have 4 or 5 sets of wheels on the dishwasher, but what can you do :slight_smile:

I put a couple of drops of Dawn Dish Detergent in the little cup that normally gets powdered detergent.  It takes the road greese of really well.

I just use car degreaser, water and a rag. They look brand new. Also surprisingly baby wipes clean wheels very well, hell you can make your whole board look new with baby wipes lol

That is true.  I was doing some pics for a science faire at my kids high school, he used his board to prove the viability of personal small form factor electric vehicles by skating all over the commons and scaring the shit out of everyone :slight_smile:.

Anyways, we made it look brand spankin new by using baby wipes, grip gum and a little bit of armor all. 

I had forgotten about that.

Power of baby wipes!

Before 
![20181030_000148|666x500](upload://7LYIdJ9Gm5DgIXNI61iCmwJLGAW.jpeg) 

After 1 baby wipes and no degreaser.
![20181030_001011|666x500](upload://rMS3uW3AvZ2c1CSytWIUWqKZB7Q.jpeg) 

Now for this wheel I would absolutely need some degreaser I have some spots in-between the spolks that look like road tar deposits that won't come off with baby wipes alone but if your wheel isn't as dirty as mine it would do the trick.

Another example my 107s have alot less road tar on it so it cleaned up very well with only baby wipes.
