Been eyeing these for a few weeks.
Think I know what I'm getting myself for Christmas. Would be great to have something like this not only for esk8 but for the few times a year I get to go do downhill runs. Maybe not daily wear but still.
Anybody know much about them?
Thoughts?

This is a wise investment for those who like to push the limits of speed

@sk8l8r
Hit the asphalt at any speed and your gonna loose skin. 

With leathers, you can get up and keep going.

Can be worn when taking our the trash, laundry day, cold nights in the winter as pjs, it's technically a suit so weddings, office parts, funerals if you get it in Black. So many uses. You would be wasting money on several other outfits that this thing can do all of. Pays for itself lol

Wow he got straight back up. Definitely proved they work.
He felt it... moving gingerly looked back to see his left arm....still there lol
Nice tuck and roll....great muscle memory.
He's one tuff boy. 

The leathers definitely get the tick in the burn through time protection.

Nice of you @Skunk to point out there many uses lol

@Wraith must have been TKP's lol I hope. 

How does anyone feel about the Demon Flex Force Pro Body Armour as an alternative?

Made for snowboarders, skiers mountain biking lightweight, flexible materials the don't have the burn through slide protection for road which is really the point.
In summer they would be more comfortable as we ride for longer maybe we would be more likely to use them. 
They focus on impact and are on special at the moment in most sizes at Absolute-Snow UK

SAS-Tec ribcage, elbow, shoulder, spine pads: A soft foam with shock absorbing properties
Additional collarbone padding protection
Fully ventilated underarm and side
Redesigned for use all year round, perfect for both snow sports and mountain biking
Neck brace compatible
Adjustable elbow straps for a better fit and wrist supports
Front zipper entry
Fully CE EN 1621-1


What do you think?

I like how we're all different and using these boards for different reasons. My rides are leisurely strolls at 10mph with a ¬£10 coffee in one hand and my clutch purse full of tampons in the other hand (control the board with sheer manifest hatred). I never had a specific place to be and never have a time limit.

Any speed can break bones and crush helmets I know, but I'm definitely not out pushing the envelope every day. A sturdy helmet and the knowledge that I'm going to eat pavement at some point every month and have to go home to a wife's judgement is all the protection I need.

yeah runout for me is like 18-20mph. 99% of the time that's all i'm doing anyway because i just like carving around mostly. Most recently i've been commuting to work but just in a helmet because i'm still only maintaining those kinds of speeds. 

Virginia was the result of me starting a fight in a strange bar, so to speak.

Every time I hurt myself on a board I tell myself I need to dial it back.
And then usually before the injuries even finished healing I think f*** that and go bomb a hill.
I've lost count of how many broken bones I've had.  And I quite literally can't remember how many concussions I've had because you know concussions.......
Still... my first build I'm going 12s on 6374s. So I haven't learned a thing. Lol
Although you guys did all guilt me into wearing helmets now.

I get it,  I do.
But whenever do wear one (always now that I have the pass) there's this voice in the back of my head making fun of me.

@Skunk same here re:helmets, I've owned one in the past and only wore it when required by the event I was taking part in, since I got my TGS Pass that all changed, you'll find that 'little fun making voice' disappear the moment your head is bouncing of the ground!  :) 

I saw a docu on Kevin Pearse while waiting for my bajaboard (1st deck) to arrive - convinced me to take TBI seriously.

Unless you are actually downhill racing why would you need one of these?
A motorcycle jacket, slide gloves and kneepads (and maybe some crashpants) are more than enough.
It's not like you will be falling all the time so need the abrasion resistance of leather.

FOV is super wide horizontal and vertical, it doesn't obstructs much the view from first impression.

Weight is between 1360 and 1460 but good balance so I don't find it heavy (note I haven't tried something like a TSG pass lol so that's lightweight to me for now).

Also found out that despite my big forehead I fit a M üòÇ

I almost pulled the trigger on one of these suits the other day. But held back. I can't decide if more of an impact protection would be better. I wrote BTR about their leathers and why they are the way they are. I dont know if the leather offer enough impact protection (there must be some) or if I really need something else. As you can see they do recommend using crashpants under the suit. But what about the upper body. Do anyone here have any experience? 

"Our suit comes with 2 ply leather on most vulnerable positions - knees, elbows and seat for more durability. 

For protection in our basic suits we use removable CE approved flexible polyurethane pads on knees, double ply leather and soft foam padding in between on elbows and back protection. (also we can offer polyurethane elbow pads if you think you want them) 

Additionally we can offer D3O protection at additional cost (D3O is a leading technology in the market)

Reason we don't use shoulder protection like bike suits would because that would limit rider's mobility and our mobility is what really protects us, you see when you can balance yourself moving your arms and having ability to move you often can save yourself anticipating fall unlike motorcycle riders who are locket in sitting position. 

For hips we always recommend to use crash shorts under the leather suit, so you have option to remove when not needed or change model when needed."

My biggest fear is that the electronics fucks up. That would come totally unexpected making a different crash than if you can anticipate the crash and initiate the fall your self using the leather. Maybe a more impact based protection would be batter for those crashes?

I guess that's true but I can definitely see Mobility hindering balance with to much gear.
Falling is kind of muscle memory for me at this point. So even in unexpected crashes I do pretty well doing it correctly.

## \#60 Posted by: Grozniy Posted at: 2019-04-05T22:47:44.902Z Reads: 50

```
In my opinion, esk8ters crash because of:
-road hazards
-car drivers
-esk8 malfunction
-speed wobbles
-uncontrolled carving

Since most esk8ers are not DH riders, we don't know how to control the board at it fullest. Also we tend to go much faster than we can control. And our decks are chosen for enclosure compatibility and looks, not really for DH. Of course I'm generalising the community, there are members with great skill and setup.
So for us speed junkies and DH noobs, we need hard shell on the outside and soft foam on inside to protect from unexpected fall and to be able to slide it out since we go to fast to just roll once.

Just my 2 cents

I agree.  Its kinda crazy how many novice skaters are just able to build boards capable of braking 35mph.
I think people are comforted by the idea of brakes, and "being in control". 
Personally if i couldn't control a gravity powered board as fast as my esk8 goes i probably wouldn't ride it.
I think for some more protection is needed,  but for others it might be a hindrance.

I learned on a 12s mountainboard. Crashed real bad after about a year doing an accelerated slide around a bend, strapped in so my knees slammed down. Swollen to the size of a mango for about 2 weeks and immobilized whole knee (thought i tore tendons).  Walked out of the ER with crutches in hand and carried them way home in my hands while on the board. Definitely need some protection, but i think it's mostly knees and elbows for the people riding offroad and around towns (vs downhills).

Now, the question is, you may be able to control a gravity powered board going as fast as our boards do, but if the gravity doesn't stop, can *you* stop *it*?

I think if that's the case, no need to worry about ever losing brakes. I wouldn't feel safe above 35mph if I didn't feel confident enough pulling a slide at 35mph on a sidewalk (an extreme). 

Locked up wheels, other vesc glitches... Leathers sound great for that. I used to fall all the time in my leathers, it was amazing. It was easier than taking a fall playing soccer or something.

When doing down hill you often anticipate the crash and can react to it - Right? When we experience a sudden electronic failure its out of the blue and the crash might be different than if we "know" that now we will fall. Do you think that leathers still would be the best form of protection? I am talking about 35mph+

The original and still the best maker of leathers for skaters.

I had one of these out of the blue crashes recently, it sucks, you really have no time to plan for the fall or even brace for impact. My leading foot impacted first and whipped the rest of my body into the asphalt severing some none essential nerves in my hip and crushing my rib cage and left shoulder ending with my helmet taking a huge blow that left me KO'ed. The impact knocked the wind out of me leaving me groaning for air as I was unconscious.

When I came to, my dude asked me where I was and I laughed and said "at the races!" Had I not had leathers on I doubt I would have been laughing. I would have been covered in abrasions and lacerations from ragdolling across the road.

Some hip pads under my leathers are probably the only thing I will change. My leathers have knee shoulder and elbow pads and they definitely did a good job in keeping me on my feet as I recover.

Guess you could say...

_Your leathers saved your hide._

Also your helmet was a champion. 

Once again, glad you're okay bud. That was a helluva crash and I'm glad you walked away _relatively_ unscathed.

Still kicking myself for not crouching properly. I doubt I would have had such a rough fall if I had better form. I'm pretty sure I was standing tall coming out of that last turn.

Speedy recovery to you. 
So for you its leathers hands down. And leathers for abrasion protection sunds like the way to go. You dont think hard pads in shoulder and over chest would have been nice for you? But that properly not the best combo with leathers. So one properly have to choose.

The only thing that holds me back from adding more protection is keeping mobility while riding and keeping it simple so I always wear everything I need. A chest protector would have been nice but had I been crouching I wouldn't have had such a hard blow from the kung fu whip the asphalt gave me.

Is it a skate skin you have? With shoulder pads. They normally don't put shoulder pads in skate skins right?

You can get skate leathers with pads anywhere you like from NJK, still saving up to have my set made. I am currently using some moto leathers, took me ages to break them in. I actually ended up swapping out the pads for some slimmer pads to get a decent fit. 

The seams on my "off the shelve" leathers have exposed seams all over the place so they probably wont hold up as well as what I have seen from NJK.
