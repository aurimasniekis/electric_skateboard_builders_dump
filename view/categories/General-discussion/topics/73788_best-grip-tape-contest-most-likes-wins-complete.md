It is a Red Ember Caldera that had seen some abuse.

How did you get the shiny effect?

@briman05 that Joker board is one bad MOFO it's underrated.

@ARetardedPillow I say go all out, wing on the back and a R/C Pick-up or truck body on the front and voilà ! Wait for the next "**Get out of the road ! That's not for skateboards**" person to come at you and see reaction when they find out you ride a mini-truck

Thanks for the pro tip. Don't have silvertip but I got 2 liter of Sicomin resin, supposedly can give the shiny finish too if layers are applied properly. But how does it fare against flex, is the deck stiff ?

It is definitely a stiff deck.  In terms of flexibility it goes polyurethane>epoxy>polyester resin.

Agents of Shield, black on black on black because there are two grades of frit. The AoS logo is in fine, the rest is in medium. Opalescent black glass on a black deck. 

i think this is one of the many that never made it to insta, further proof that you can't know my entire catalog simply by following me.

Only two of the phase leads are white, i thought it would make things more interesting. The customer actually asked for "stealth but bling but low key, pops but still stealth", i forget how he put it but it was an interesting juxtaposition of "popping" and "stealth" which are sort of in conflict, yet harmony as it turns out.

Not really, play around with the settings (on some spare griptape) and you'll find the sweetspot in no time! Lay grip side down as the particles may bend/diffuse the beam.

I do mine grip up, no issues with the beam... Play with the settings and you can leave the backing paper mostly untouched so more complex designs stay together. 

I have found MOB to cut and apply most successfully.
