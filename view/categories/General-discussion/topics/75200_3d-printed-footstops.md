Hey there! My name is Shawn, and I have been building longboards for about 3 years now. My specialty has been downhill/freeride type decks and as a result my designs, construction, and products reflect that. You can check us out [here!](https://www.voxelboards.com/)

With the industry changing and being no stranger to the urban sprawl of cities like Los Angeles, Portland, San Fransisco, etc - my background in robotics and my wanderlust both desire a solution in the form of an electric longboard to make my travels more efficient and intimate. I'm excited to see where that project takes me, and am enthusiastic that I can find unique solutions to make my personal build and our future esk8 products truly stand out.

Now that we've been introduced, here's what I've come to talk about. Footstops! I was pleased to see a thread talking about footstops where the OP had posted a picture of ours, asking if a footstop was at all worth picking up for their setup. I was super flattered to see my product pop up on it's own, and I couldn't be happier that it was here. I just wanted to give you guys a quick run down about them:

They come in two sizes (Regular, and Mini) and lots of colors/materials! Our footstops are designed with triangular geometry and a stepped ledged design. The robust shape goes hand in hand with it's rotational symmetry, giving you a comfortable position almost anywhere you rotate it.

Our mini footstop has an advantage over the regular one I find with people who don't need too much extra to keep them on their decks, but could benefit from the extra tactile feedback. I currently include my mini footstops with the regular size as a sort of bundle to get the most bang for you buck. I talk a lot about the implication this product has for my company on my [blog](https://www.voxelboards.com/our-3d-printed-footstops-why-they-matter/). I also recently had the honor to have a small interview published to [Concrete Wave Mag](https://concretewavemagazine.com/2018/10/beating-expectations-voxel-boards/), and I would appreciate a read or a comment if you have the time. Thanks to everyone for your patience reading this, I appreciate all the feedback and the support that I get! Please check out our decks as well, although I plan on winding down production for the winter slightly, I might be willing to make an exception if I can get enough interest behind one final batch. I hope everyone is enjoying their autumn!

- Shawn
