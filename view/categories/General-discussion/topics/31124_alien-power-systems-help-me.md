He doesn't come on here all that often...

Which email address are you trying to use to get in contact with him?
I'll pm you his email I usually use to ask him about products...I don't feel it's right to do so on an open forum, in case he's uncomfortable with that.

I have contacted him by the link on their website and got timely response.
If you think 8 pounds for shipping is high, your lucky, it's much higher to USA.

Yer I can imagine tryed the link redirects to his email just keep getting error message not sent. like I say don't mind the postage if everything was in stock that I needed also If u take into account distance traveled ur postage probably works our cheaper I.e per mile
