So, I was browsing my LinkedIn connections the other day and I realized most of my connections hardly know me at all and can't possibly reflect on me in any sort of way, positively or negatively.  To be honest, most of my hobby projects which might demonstrate my electronics skills to a future employer have all been esk8 or electric vehicle related and I post about them here.  I also have sold a few new and used items here and all of my customers have been more than happy with my products.

I guess what I am trying to say is some of the members on this forum know me professionally better than most of my LinkedIn contacts, so if you have had any previous interaction with me or another forum member which you think reflects in a positive and professional way, connect on LinkedIn!

I know this is probably only relevant to other college students like me, but I always think its cool when I can somehow tie my hobbies into my future professional career and I'd hope there are a few other people out there who would like to do the same!

Just DM me!
