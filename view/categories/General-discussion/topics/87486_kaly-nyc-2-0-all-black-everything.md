**What's up! So like I said would bring you guys the photos of the complete package once I met with the captain himself @Kaly. Here I bring you the Triple Black Package. This weekend we were out in DC for a group ride so I managed to snap a couple of photos. Enjoy!**

Super nice. Subjective, but all it needs now is bindings.

I know their boards are pretty much super customization, but what range and top speed are people usually getting with these boards? Id guess like 25-45 miles and 30mph ish top speed?

@Kaly gives you real specs not no china specs with a 110 lbs person. Specs are a person that is 210 lbs riding through NYC can get 23-26 miles. And that’s real world miles not no (riding at 18 mph) miles. And top speed is around 40+.

But remember no is riding at a constant 40+ mph everywhere so you'll get mostly that mileage all the time. Can’t wait to get my hands on that XL75+ V2.
