Hey has anyone attempted a 10s6p battery in a spud/ Tayto yet with this eboosted enclosure? if no one has done it I might just do a 10s6p build since I have an extra Tayto and vesc on hand. @Eboosted @JLabs but I imagine the battery is going to be a heck of a lot, 60, 30q are *$240.00* alone.

** and would velcro even hold a battery that heavy?

Eboosted Enclosure mentioned above.

Basically this battery from eboosted but twice the thickness.

If you contact @Eboosted I thick he can build a custom battery for the DS.

I'm worried about the weight lol since my 10s3p spud already weighs like 20 bricks

For what you have an enclosure?
Velcron +enclosure and you good to go...

I just wonder, if nobody would have done it before, why than there are enclosures from Eboosted available in this size? ðŸ¤”

for the people who want to use lipos, and for that one crazy person like me

you could probably just enclosure mount the battery, but i would get a lot of hate lol

Board below has a 10s6p 30Q pack on a Jet Spud DS enclosure.

It fits comfortably. You could even fit a 12s6p if the pack is built compact.

Does it weigh like a brick though? 
[/quote]

I don't get your logic here. Just double the weight of your 10s3p and you can get a rough idea of how much it will weigh?

Yeah it weights a lot.. around 22lbs, but if you want a big battery you will sacrifice weight, not much you can do around it.

Yep, have to mall grab. After a few blocks it's pretty inconvenient.

[quote="AlanZhou, post:12, topic:80098"]
also who built your battery. and did you board mount or enclosure mount you battery.
[/quote]

I built locally in Montreal with some friends. Bought 1s6p packs from the Lacroix guys and connected them with a custom harness.

I mounted it to the enclosure initially and it worked, but during this winter I will change things around and mount it to the deck using neutral silicone sealant glue.

I have a Spud with a 10S5P underneath (http://www.diyeboard.com/10s5p-18650-lithium-battery-pack-36v-10ah-360wh-p-460.html) if that helps? 3D printed my own enclosure though.

I mall-grab it. Don't care about the weight so much, but then I'm not carrying it much.

3D printed enclosure. M4 cap-screws (bolts?) into threaded inserts.

Example from pictures thread:

```
6 M4s in the part that supports the battery (the blue-grey part), 2 each in the end bits (green bit, red bit). The end bits only hold the VESCs.

I don't profess to be an expert though. I'm only guessing, but have had this type of configuration going for about a year with no mishap. Have even "bottomed-out" on some driveway curbs a few times with little effect (PLA FTW!).
