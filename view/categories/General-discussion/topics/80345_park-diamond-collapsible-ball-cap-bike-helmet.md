Personally would rather test this on my knee than my skull, but what do I know - they're overfunded.

Are we wearing these since they're better than nothing?  

What happens when we get pulled over lol

I wouldn't even use a regular helmet that isn't full faced, let alone a collapsable thin hat.

I'm sorry, what the fuck...

**$1,481,877 USD total funds raised**

That is over the top stupid, it's a helmet, a poor protection helmet at that.

if it can fold, it will not protect your head! its an over glorified cap. also what abt the ears? if you fall u can slide and ur ear is not there anymore.

Well mabye it would protect your head if it's made of that football helmet orange stuff, don't exactly remember the materials name

But good luck to your ears and nose

I have a similar foldable helmet from an IGG campaign as well, called the LID helmet. Pretty cool and is certified to be a helmet. I believe this Diamond helmet has certifications of some sort too. ![22fb-cover-mob-first|690x262](upload://tOkeS9fniteQyNk3c5qLTtOUDc3.png)

Or fill the helmet with clay and Shockwatch damage indicators inside a plastic bag, then drop gym weights on it from different angles.  Do the same with a skate helmet and a $19 foam bike helmet and no helmet.  Or just resurrect the Mythbusters from retirement.

I've watched this at least 50 times. 

Is it just me or does it seem like the regular helmet has a lot more give to it, or does this not matter? I'm not a helmet scientist.

 The more I watch it the more the music just sounds like a cracked skull.

what does the bouncing even mean. So, of course a cap isn't gonna bounce as much, how does that prove it protected anything?

Every add I see says they are $29.99 until they sell a certain amount and then they are going back up to $99. I really want this to be real but I feel like it‚Äôs a scam. I‚Äôll wait until people actually have them in their hands.

I signed up for a new account, just to say this; this USD29.99 are a freaking scam.

I paid for one a couple of weeks back, and when PayPal showed a Shenzen, China business, I knew I've hit a stinker. Received it today, and it's so fake its actually funny. Avoid this company called Bulestyle, on IG, like the plague

Some of these helmets, real or the fake,I can‚Äôt imagine being very protective being so thin and doesn‚Äôt have one solid outer shell.

I ride like a maniac on a bike obeying no laws and drafting cars everywhere.  It‚Äôs a crazy race everywhere and I never wear a helmet and I don‚Äôt wear one when skating unpowered either but on an eboard i always wear a helmet and have smacked my head really hard a couple of times and glad my helmet wasn‚Äôt as wimpy as these ![image|281x499](upload://bCdmeaIRtiB4OXIP3gGWLPIZvmb.jpeg) 

My last bad fall my helmet saved me again but collarbone and neck maybe will never heal and for sure loss of mobility and maybe always pain 

Take care.  I loved flying around but my high speed days are done.  Gunna hook my motors up to something else

On the case.  Be healed enough to make them at least. (Almost got it all in the bag w all manufacturing)
My point is it‚Äôs a very dangerous sport, way more so than spending a lifetime playing in traffic with cars on a bike even without a helmet.  And then there‚Äôs people who want to do 45mph.  I‚Äôd get a decent helmet at minimum.  And at least long sleeves and pants.  Was looking on Reddit and people stories of how they literally lost chunks of skull n lucky to be alive without a helmet. I‚Äôm mostly extremely reckless and pretty much am in every other aspect.   It‚Äôs not like with a beater car where when it breaks and ur leaning full force on the gas you just roll to a stop.
