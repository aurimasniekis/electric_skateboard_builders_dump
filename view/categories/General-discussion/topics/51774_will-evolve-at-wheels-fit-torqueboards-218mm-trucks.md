having issues finding AT wheels/truck combo to use on my long board build. i dont want to use the evolve trucks. i wish i could use the trampa 6.5in superstars theyre so sexy but they are too wide and bearing size is slightly too big. would these trucks work or is there any truck that will accommodate the evolve AT wheels with minimal modifications?

I may be confused, but you should be able to fit Evolve AT wheels straight on the TB 218 trucks, they are both 8mm shafts.  You will have an issue with the wheel pulleys that come with the Evolve AT wheels as they have a 10mm bearing slor that rests on a 10mm shoulder on the truck.

It’s youre deck. You’re probably getting wheelbite. The evolve wheels fit all regular skateboard hubs. Get a different deck or sand down those areas but you then might hit you’re feet.

Can you mod past the issue or is it best to find different pullies.. I won't have these wheels till later this week but I assume I will face the same thing

You can just use 2 skate bearings instead.

Use 8mm to 10mm spacer for evolve pullies also you can use trampa wheels with the board bumpers adaptor.

As was said before the pulley has a special bearing with 10 mm inside diameter which you may can change against a regular bearing depending on the width and outside diameter. But, won't you run into the same problem as with regular Caliber II trucks that you have to remove about 7-8 mm of the hanger material in order to accommodate the extra bearing? 

Just checked my model and it seems like that the bearing has a width of 6 mm, 10 mm bore and an outside diameter of 22 mm.

You don't have to remove material with the TB 218 trucks they have extended axles. Sounds like you can just pop in a regular skate bearing.and it will work though

Evolve wheels by themselves will fit. But you'll need to lathe/cut/sand down the truck hanger about 10mm or so to accommodate the bearing on the Evolve pulley.

So these aren't a direct fit but they can fit if you make it work. @longhairedboy has a video on how you can remove it.

We'll have some pneumatic options in the near future also. Working on a few things so we're a bit behind on that.

so if the measurements for the evolve rear bearing is 6x22x10 would there be issues using a skateboard bearing being as they are 2mm thicker?. if this is the case i can use a regular bearing this will be amazing to hear. if 2mm of clearance more is needed in order to properly tighten the axle nut then i dont mind cutting a bit of hanger material off.  Thanks for all the replys this has been a real pain for me the past 2 days

Evolve uses a regular skateboard bearing on their pulley.

You just need to sit the bearing on an 8mm axle and then you can thread the wheel onto it.

This image is how it looks on a 218mm Truck.

On my TB 218s with 6 shooters I only use 1 spacer next to the hanger. I could use 4 speed rings to set the wheel as far it as possible but only use 1. Nit sure if that correlates to the eveolve wheels.

i c the problem now with the hanger :expressionless:. looks like i will be cutting. i put on regular berings, still needs more space for
TB218's. with a single bearing it will sit on there ok, but cant say thats safe at all :rofl:

if anyone can confirm the belt size using the evolve wheel and AT pulley 65T on tb218 lemme know. these pulleys are quite large i measured something like 410mm for belt not using tensioners on marc mounts. i already startred shaving the hanger

i was told that these are the correct size, im not 100% as i havent received them and wheels yet. i will also be using macs mounts with the idler pulleys

Hmmm if you don’t use the idlers wouldn’t you run either too tight or too loose belts since there’s no motor movement to adjust with? I wonder it it would be possible to deflate the tires to adjust idlers and then pump it back up one a belt it tensioned

Working on it. Started with Dremel and hand file.. somewhere less than a inch I'm going to say... really want to get it even on both sides. It's hard with the circular cutting disc and not destroy axle. Hoping to finish today and waiting for belts. The dust that it puts off is crazy, had to move this stuff to the back of my suv.

after getting my wheels in today i got everything mocked up and it looks like the drive wheels will need about 12mm cut out of the hanger to be able to make up for the 2mm extra thickness of the rear bearing and to be able to show all of the axle nut threading. also the front wheels if going dual rear will need a spacer made to fit the extended axles as well.

So have to order another set of belts 420-5m-15 would not cut it, still a little short. Will be getting 430 soon I hope.. idler clearance is also questionable

you cant use the idler pulley. the clearance isnt there. the clearance for is almost the same as how thick the belts are. i wasnt able to get them to work. i ordered 410 and a 415mm belt to see what would fit as 420mm was too long and 405 was too short. use with urethane wheels and idler pulley would work since the wheel pulley is so much smaller.

that was my fear. i went up a size, bad choose again.... what about a smaller diameter bearing for idlers? do you notice slippage running 410?

i never thought of using a smaller bearing. that might actually work. if you do end up using one let me know! i went with a smaller belt size since i gave up on using the idler pulley.

Got a bunch of belts today unfortunately Marcmounts would not work for these sizes

410-5m-15
430-5m-15
420-5m-15

Note* this is in reference to tb218 with evolve at kit..
I tried single idler, dual, no idler, inflated, deflated, and lightly greased belts. It seems without idlers as @rexpepper651 said is the best way to go. I'm thinking 415-5m-15 to make that possible. Might try 435, but for now I'm stumped on what I'm doing wrong here. It seemed like 430 might have worked with single idler, but it had too much dragg with any idler position ☹ if anyone has run this setup before with dual 6355 give me a shout

Interested in these pneumatic options in the near future... do you have a target release date for either the wheels or info about the wheels?

@bloke900 no exact target date but we're working on them. designs are pretty much done. i'd say we're still about 3-4 months off to be on the safe side. They are 160x50 as of now. I wish I had them already but I don't :crying_cat_face:

Since Torqueboards pneumatic wheels are not available yet are there other trucks that will fit the Evolve AT wheels easily?

Or are there pneumatic AT wheels that won't break the bank and fit the torqueboards 218mm trucks?

We're working on our own pneumatic tires. Trying to release them as soon as we can.

Of course, have to do testing first. It will take longer due to everything being custom.

160x50 street tire and then perhaps a 180x50 all terrain tire.

It's looking pretty sweet though.. :) If I had to give an ETA.. Hopefully 2-3 months...

I'm using @marcmt88 mounts with 435 mm belts with one idler for last 200km. mounts work with 450mm belts with dual idlers too.
445mm will probably work too with dual idlers.
