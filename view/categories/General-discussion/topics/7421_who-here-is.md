I suck at stuff like that. $130 AUD is the cheapest I can find a deck this shape anyway.

Finding a friend or a local builder wouldn't be hard, and I'm sure they don't charge much if anything since its such a simple task. Those decks are nice, but they might be too flexy, which is why I didn't buy one, then I'd have to do split enclosures. 

Choose whatever but if you buy some wood from bunnings, one deck will cost you $15

Higher torque, lower speed. It is going to be hard to get that screw out though without some proper heat. Maybe even put it in av oven. @lowGuido could you please tell me what heat you need to remove red loctite?

Heat is only way to get out loctite red. Unless you have some methylene chloride available to you. That will melt practically any plastic or epoxy so only use on 100% metal parts. Powder coating companies use a 70% version to remove powder coating from parts that have to get re-coated.
Nasty stuff definitely be careful handling it.

Hey is anyone keen on group buying enertions vesc -x motor controller? Their products are on sale now. 
Price goes on
1 - 10: $168.8
11-20: $ 153.7
21 - 30: $ 148.4
31- 40: $ 118.8
41- 50: $ 110.5
51 - : $ 89.3

Price is on USD + 10% tax 
Original price was like $200 
It would be a HUGE bargain if we get it down to $89.3 (probably not gon happen though). I'd love to get the price down as much as possible and get one myself. Apparently the sale goes on for 6 days only so if anyone wants to join, we should organize it quickly :slight_smile:

Does anybody know whether it is allowed to ride an esk8 on roads where the speed limit is 50km/h? I did a quick test ride (during night time) on the road and guess what, police came by, slowed down, stayed a while behind me then overtook. So, obviously wasn't a problem? But, just in case what are the rules here in Stralia?

I got my bamboo from China. Australian Skateboard Kits imports maple from roarockit, they are really nice too. Would definitely recommend. Also, I hated working with bamboo, it's really fragile especially if you don't get the vertical lamination stuff. Go maple and DIY, or buy a bamboo deck.
