So some one posted about the services of entertioms first reptor with concerns for the second and onloop closed the thread. I think it's bullshit and I also think that he has given almost no real specs on the new raptor 2 besides these hubs supposedly being so magical they will be the best. @hummie I believe questioned the specs and he replied with just wait and see but before I drop 900 or even 1500 on a board I wanna at least know the specs of it

things like this are why this forum exists...and why its a conflict of interest for a owner/seller to also mod  a place that is meant to be open.

there are other forums that exist where this type of thing wont be a problem and you won't get **sales people disguised as "users".**

The title it absolutely true but does not reflect the real situation well enough. There was NEVER ever free speech on this forum. It is heavily moderated by enertion from the day 1. If you write something that **His Majesty** doesn't like it gets flagged or closed in no time. That's why I like endless-sphere so much more. But it runs shitty old phpBB.

Still I believe in the power of the community. If this moderation becomes more and more of an issue, we can make a revolution (just fork this forum and run it openly with proper moderators who are well respected members here)

@rmrf @saul agree on both i tend to ask a ton of questions but would like to feel I help at least a few boobs out on here. Opinion matters and with everyone hyped about the new raptor 2 I think they forgot about all the previous promises Jason has made and failed to meet. It's easy to talk but harder to make good on ur words. I personally would at least like some motor specs, how do we know they are truly better than hummies? Besides the fact that they have a 6372 stator or something

@willpark16 why you are even asking this? I would never buy anything from the company with so awful customer care and bully attitude. All the innovation is bullshit. **CarvON3 + VESC6** will easily shred these little rapto-reptiles to pieces. Read, study and build yourself, do not buy overpriced shit.

honestly, this forum is more open than closed. I have spoken a lot of crap about enertion (when I feel something is said by Jason is bs), and never had any of it removed. Threaten to be banned, but not removed, lol.

It is what it is though. I thought it was shaddy when he started advertising enertion products on the top of the forum like he has, where no one else can advertise but him.

Inh theory, his products are solid. But IMO, there's poor manufacturing, which bring him down. This is why I think chaka has yje right idea by making his freeride boards in house and not outsourcing the work to china. You can quality control the entire process when you do the work. You can't quality control it when it's sent to some factory in china... And that will be the fatal flaw of the raptor 2.

As a mod of the forum I'd like to mention that the reason complaints get flagged is not to limit free speech. It's just annoying. People come here for information, we tolerate some complaints but remember that these threads are all public. If you have complaints we suggest contacting the vendor unless it is something you feel the public should know.

The complaints against NRtion vs. other manufacturers - both items and services - are handled differently.
There are a lot others could learn from those complaints! Even simple (or re-edited) comments are wiped out from here.

[/quote]

Closing a thread isn't the same as censoring it... it's still available to read, closing it just means no further commenting will be added, which is a strategy we use to keep forum threads on-topic.

@willpark16 I'm a mod here on the forum and no one has ever instructed me to treat comments about Enertion differently than comments about any other vendor. I volunteer my time to help keep the forum running because the help and support I've received on the forum is valuable to me. I think that all of the other mods feel the same. None of us work for Enertion (except for Jason of course).

A lot of people come to the forum and treat it like a public customer service portal for Enertion products; they vent frustrations, complain about shipping delays, etc. When we (the mods) see posts like that, we have to make a judgement about whether the thread will provide value to current or future readers. We try to reduce clutter so that the meaningful content can prevail.

I've read nearly every thread in its entirety on this forum, over 9,300 posts, and with that perspective I'll tell you that there are plenty of criticisms of Enertion on the forum. They aren't deleted. Which I think is more than fair since Enertion fronts the bill and started the forum in the first place.

On any forum there are going to be disagreements about what kinds of threads are allowed. I don't think it's a fair or accurate assessment, @willpark16, to declare that the forum isn't open to all on-topic discussions.

This whole thread is bullshit...

@sandbound "This thread will be locked or deleted as soon as he wakes up"
That is nothing more than rhetoric.  If you dont like it, then leave, but dont screw up the experience for the rest of us.

@willpark16 "Agreed but I'd rather spend 1600 on something that works rather than a discounted 900 on a product that haven't even been tested"
Then buy one and test it.  Complaining about a NEW product that hasn't been tested is just stupid.

I would suggest that anyone who doesn't like the assumed profit margins or quality of a seller, dont buy from them.  If you are right, its self correcting.  These are experimental boards with experimental electronics...and for anyone that just cant seem to figure it out, this ain't Wal-Mart.  Buy a benchwheel or boosted board if you don't want the hassle and enjoyment of building a board yourself or using experimental electronics.  But, if you do that you get boards that might catch on fire or only do 7 mph.  

On the subject of treating sellers reasonably.  @psychotiller, @Hummie and @torqueboards post on here all the time about the products they sell.  Not to mention the countless other users that don't have actual businesses that are selling just mounts or batteries or whatever.

Regarding the up-sell banner at the top of the website...@onloop is paying for hosting, dns services, development software, development services, etc. (and his own freaking time for gators sake), so why shouldn't he get a little advertising?  I'm sure if you offered him $.25 a click he'd let you advertise maxi-pads, or whatever.

I'm getting the distinct feeling that this thread is being pushed by people that are either trolls, screwed up hardware through misuse or bad installs and are pissed that they couldn't get a refund or are just the type of people that when angry don't give a damn about screwing up everyone else's good time...cause that's ok right?

I have never even bought anything from Enertion, but he has been happy to help when I had a question.  That tells me he is in this because he loves skating and is just trying to make a living doing something he enjoys.  If you cant respect that, catch out and leave the reasonable people alone to pursue their hobbys.

This board isnt being sold as a project or something to tinker with.  Adjusting belts is a given just like a chain on a motorcycle its expected.  He is selling these as a finished product not a kit you build.  Big difference.

[quote="mmaner, post:24, topic:13808"]
I have never even bought anything from Enertion
[/quote]

haha, and here's why you don't get the anger. When you spend a few hundred dollars for something you never really got the performance you were promissed, you would want to complain too. I bought 2 vescs, one came broken and the other broke day 2. I have bought 8 from chaka since, I used the same firmware, same software, went through the same install process, I'm not an idiot with electronics and I'm aware of things like ESD events, same motors, same settings, and not 1 has broken in many many months of running. Jason wouldn't give me any money back, replacement, or repair. Onloop claims his failure rate is super low, but that's assuming everyone would try to contact him if they broke it. Even than, chakas failure rate is a fraction of what onloop claims his is (and chaka will fix it, even if you blow it up, so I think anytime his breaks, people will contact him. That's not a coincidence.

What if we had a thread for complaints about each vendor, i.e. one for enertion ,one for evolve, ect? So the community knows the problems others are having with a given product and their experiences. Not only can others learn, but the vendors them selvs can learn to.

@evoheyax "When you spend a few hundred dollars for something you never really got the performance you were promissed, you would want to complain too."

The first DIY motor and ESC I bought lasted 3 days but I recognized that I couldn't be completely sure that it wasn't my fault, so I let it go and bought a Mamba Monster 2 and another motor.  Dexter was as helpful as I expected from a 1st rate seller, I didn't get a refund or even a repair, but he was handy with advice and discounted my next purchase.  

But even if I hadn't been happy with the result, I wouldn't have gone to the internet and started raising hell.  By doing that you have essentially talked possibly hundreds of people into NOT building/buying an electric skateboard.  Right or wrong, your approach was engineered to piss people off.  Well you did.

I don't think you are being reasonable nor do I think you are being fair to all the other users.

damage? I made a simple point dont ask people to put hundreds or even thousands of dollars down before at least having a working prototype so people can see what they are getting. I can show u photos of cad models and parts I had cncd all day but seeing their preformance is an entirely different issue. As for feedback, the seller should take it as consructive critiscism or ignore it. But if hundreds of people started telling me there was something wrong id start changing things

The thing is, I burnt up 3 esc's and 3 motors before I learned what I was doing. I made all of the rookie mistakes before I ever bought a vesc. I spent many hours researching it, read all about the issues I could have and how to avoid them. The thing is, if you studied enertion, you would know they switch through 3 factories in china which all produced some good and many poor quality vescs. Chaka has stated the number one reason he believes vescs are breaking so easily is not user error, but poor manufacturing. 

If a particular vendor claims to have a stellar reputation for a product, when many users have had nightmares with a fraction being user error and no CS to help, somethings wrong. And the community should know that. Like I said, I had a bad experience. Many others have also. If this becomes a pattern (which for a while before these kinds of threads got shut down), it speaks about a company. And it's information the community should have.

If you want to blame everything to user error, then you've never experienced buying a product, to have it crap out on you immediately under proper operation or come broken, and get no refund/replacement/repair. And those products are 100's of $$$.

This thread is still open isn't it? 

Personally I'm shocked how much free speech is permitted on this forum relative to other product forums. It's why I keep coming back. I was going to buy a raptor and didn't because of the raptor 1 issues thread I saw, so... it's not all rosy for Enertion, this forum is as much a risk for onloop as it is a boon. 

I also want to mention, aside from onloop's monetary investment in this platform he's also invested a lot of effort in making this platform highly visible and trafficked. Early on he put tons of information on this site to get the traffic, just plain old hustle got this forum to where it is today.  

I personally don't agree with all the moderation that happens on this forum, for example, I agree with willpark original post. However, I believe that forum owner has the absolute right to moderate the speech here. 

Freedom of speech is not anywhere absolute or even the most important value there is -- even in the U.S. which has some of the broadest protections for speech it's ok to prohibit certain speech like obscenity, defamation and so on. I don't think people always get that you have to have balance.

@the comments towards **all moderators** treating enertion based negative feedback:
I've never seen any mods except onloop do this, so it's unfair to put all the other mods into this basket. They all seem pretty fair in my opinion. 

@the comments about complaints about products being **annoying**:
If this were the real reason 90% of enertion complaints get hidden/renamed/threatened against then why is it we have seen so many generalisations (border line racist) comments from the majority here, more so onloop himself
Comments being "don't buy that cheap chinese shit, it's shit etc etc"

@the OP, don't be surprised when you get banned, see example below:
