I already know that a number of you are telling me to use the search but... I am looking for negatives to motorcycle helmets. I want a Bluetooth helmet and only motorcycle helmets have that option. Has anyone had issues with neck injuries after falling due to the high weight of motorcycle helmets?

Ruroc shockwave collar gives you BT

Also I saw this at REI last week. They are for snow helmets. Not sure how you can integrate into other helmets

They are a fair bit heavier than skate helmets, but I don't think it would contribute much to any neck injuries if you had to bail. Might cause fatigue in your neck of long rides though depending on how heavy it is.

There are a buttload of motorcycle helmets that are as light as a TSG pass or near enough.

Iâ€™ve been eyeing the one that Ernesto wears. I kinda like them. About $100USD looks like itâ€™s pretty popular for motorcyclist in India. Very slightly heavier than the TSG

Is that a question for me? I am debating with my family that a motorcycle helmet would be just fine for me but they seem to think that sector 9 or tsg would be a better option despite having no Bluetooth options easily.

The problem with motor cycle helmets in a lingbosrd application is the placement of padding and weight. The types of impacts we have are vastly different that what motor cyclists suffer, so the protections offers by a motor cycle helmet is not as good.
