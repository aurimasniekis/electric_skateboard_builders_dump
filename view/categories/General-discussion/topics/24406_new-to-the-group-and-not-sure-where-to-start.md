Hi all, I'm really keen on building an Electric board.  I have watched countless videos and been reading through the forum posts but i can't find the place to start. 

I am struggling to decide between a road board and going the full mountain board route.  Mountain board has the most appeal to me but I'm now wondering how i should start?  Buy the deck or start getting components etc?  Which deck should i buy and how to minimise my spend.  Ive never ridden a mountain board before of any type but i used to love riding my skateboard when i was a kid (long time ago) and these look fun.  here are the questions i have.

1) Will an older mountain board be a good place to start?  or should i buy new?  whats the difference?
2) What is the cheapest way to mount the motor to the truck?  I have seen solutions ranging upto £400 and thats way more than i can afford for something i will probably break in a month.
3) I will need a custom battery pack, from what i have seen the best are the 18650 type.  does anyone sell these pre built? i don't want to have to build it myself.

I looked at the Trampa options but they seemed like a lot of money for an unfinished board.  They still need Batteries and radio etc.  I know once I'm started i will be ok but I'm really struggling to pick a good used board on eBay because I'm basically buying blind.

Has anyone else felt like this?  I just want a ready to go solution lol its the budget constraint thats holding me back.

Welcome on board!

I think you red all the pinned Starter-threads? Good!

At first about budget and the two routes to decide from:

* A streetboard should be about 500$ if you wanna go cheap on parts, sometimes even less for a single drive. You´ll find some build logs here!

* A mountainboard is another story. 1000$ will be really cheap and you should already have some parts, like a good deck. You´ll find real offroad monsters here for more than 4000$.

To your questions:

1) Maybe, depending on what "old mountainboard" means.
2) Cheapest way is mostly building your own, if you have the tools. Cheapest solution I know comes from @Idea
3) If you are in the US, @barajabali is the man for your custom battery.

Trampa boards are the best option when it comes to mountainboards for eskates! 
Quality has it´s price!
