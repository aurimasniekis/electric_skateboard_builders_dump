I’m still working on it, not a lot of room inside the housing. Where’s some pic with a bigger thumb wheel and the inside.

Attractive and a nice form factor, the trigger looks very sturdy and responsive.  Let me know when you start selling, I'd like to give it a try.

I cant find the completed remote on the ruffycontrols site.  Do they just the small thumb part and you will do the rest?  hope its an ok price because it looks top quality controls.  no wonder you have the guard around it.  looks nice.  kinda tough.  
  how will it differ from something like the new maytech thumb control?

what do you mean that you mod the handle?  you get them made or convert it from another use? the injected plastic parts look really nice
