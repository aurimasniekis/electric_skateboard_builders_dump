I don’t know what size bearings are in those wheels, but I have those trucks and the axles are 10mm.

You would need 10x22x6mm 6900ZZ bearings and some spacers to fit 83mm wheels on those trucks. However that diameter wheel won’t leave enough clearance from the bottom of the hanger to the ground. 110mm wheels on those trucks mounted at 20° left barely enough clearance. Mounted at 35° would be less.
