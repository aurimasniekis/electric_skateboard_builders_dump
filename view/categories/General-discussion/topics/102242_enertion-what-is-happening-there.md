Yes yesterday @CarlCollins answerd my email within 24 hours but it wasn't a demand or negative. Just wondered about the tracking number and I got a reply less than 24 hours later.

1 of 5 mail got replayed the rest still no feedback yeah but I'm done with dealing with Enertion from now on.

I just ordered a nano-x from their site. I thought he was legit but I guess I should have done more research.  Did I make a mistake? It showed in stock. I hope I won't have to wait that long for it.

Since you bought a remote they have had for a long time you’ll probably get your item. That being said I’m not a fan of the remote. Much better options available

What's your favorite. I really wanted a unity since it's used in so many builds I figured it would be a good investment. Thought the remote was considered good?

Here this is a good read

https://forum./t/esk8-remotes-garbage-or-greatness/33

I’ve had the nano-x and it’s a pain having to calibrate it each time. There’s been reports of failures from other riders as you’ll read in that link. I have a Hoyt for reliability, but it is kind of a weird fit in hand. The trampa wand is coming out and that looks promising.

Mine had a failed charged port. The calibration is an ass. So is the company (CEO at least)... Now trying out a VX1. Feels more premium, no calibration and but still have to see about the reliability.

After about a year riding with my nano-X it started trying to kill me. 

Calibration every time, sticky throttle, cheap construction... This is all not too bad but when even after setting your failsafe having the remote reboot and think neutral is full throttle all while you are coasting, or just go full brake out of nowhere, or just not respond only to wake back up into full brake for half a second into full throttle into coasting and full throttle again 2 seconds later... I liked the remote for a while, but not anymore. I am meticulous when setting up my remote in vesc tool. It's not the receiver, I padded that with caps to make sure, the remote itself is just constantly doing weird shit. I tried reflowing solder joints all over it, and it seemed to help a tad, but it was only placebo.

Honestly it was alright for a while and I thought people were just ragging for no reason. Sure, cheap, shitty, hassle of a remote... But those honestly were never dealbreakers for me. I didn't listen though and kept using it.

You need to file a chargeback with your bank immediately, faulty products are one of the protections your bank will cover.

You might also want to file a complaint here if you think the product is https://www.productsafety.gov.au/contact-us/for-consumers/report-an-unsafe-product

Don't delay on getting the paperwork done for the chargeback.

Can you at least give me a hint if that Company still exists? Is Jason still on it? is there any hope? You must know more than we do, and to be fair on us pls give us some hints and tips.
Thx a lot in advance

Thanx for your Answers so far.
How ist it possible that they do so bad? Did they have a lot of faults and returns?
Is there a way I could get any response from them?

My issue is that the R2.1 suddenly doesnt switch on anymore. The Charger turns first red then after a while green. The led on the FOC Box and the LED next to the switch flicker when spinning the wheels. So i have no idea wha it could be. Maybe is it the battery?
@CarlCollins maybe you have some clue what it could be of some expieriences with those boards? If enertion doesnt react how could I analyse the error by my self?
in case it is the battery is there a way to order one directly from the provider from China? And where?
Sorry that i bombard you with so many questions but I need it to drive to my work every day and I cant afford to throw out 1500$ just like that.

Thx again for your help

Actually, it's been a lot going on internally which can't be disclosed.
All I can say is they are trying to restore first before improving.

That's actually not true, they have some issues with the finance only, not with the product. Minor issues are something which no one is spared from.

I think you will get a response once they have a CS department back.

I think you have to show me a video of your internals so I might be able to help you diagnose it first.
It's possible that battery might have some faulty cells in it or maybe a charge port issue which is not supplying enough charge to the battery.

This is laughably inaccurate. Many serious problems with the Raptor 2.1, to the point where no one should buy one. SMH.

Majority of users are having some minor issues with the Raptor 2.1

saying they don’t have a ‘customer service department‘ is bullshit when you’re the only employee (Owner) now you are every department just like before when he began the business.

If you’re trying to recover a company, going completely ghost is not really a good way to keep afloat. But they know this’ user promise, over deliver and if you can’t- communicate’... oh the irony

Remove that white ribbon cable from the BMS to the unity, connect the switch directly on the unity and go from there... Most likely your BMS is fried

I like thinking about what Jason is up to.

He doesn't seem to want to be in the public eye, does he go into the office still? Is there a office still?If he does go in what the gat dang doodly heck does he do all day. I don't care what it is I just want to know. 
Does he still esk8 regularly?

I kinda give up on Enertion when Jason does (you all did long ago I know). As long as he is there and still trying I have hope, but at this point I have no idea wether he has given up or not. I'd presume not.

He worked from home, I remember the videos and it’s all drop shipping That’s How I got my unity and now what is done with unities to amazon in America to avoid Australian protection laws and previous customers with problems 🤷‍♂️

The real people that would know are the high end builders like kaly, bio boards and lacroix be interesting what esc they switch to or rather, if their supplys from enertion have stopped.

He probably got a normal job so he can just sell unities on the side the plus side is this forum is still being payed for

I had the same problem. Board died while riding (at 18mph). No help from Enertion. The issue is the BDS PCB. The Power Switch passes thru the BDS Board, I made and uploaded a Video how to fix this. It's easy found [HERE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXsHSCcCZTY)
