I have a dual drive trampa with Vesc6+ and aps 6384 170kv. I‚Äôm getting a motor temp fault while riding. Motor temps are spiking from 60c to 80c in a matter of seconds. Even with no load on the board with it on my workbench. Any suggestions?

Motor max 80A
Motor brake -65
Batt max 70
Batt then -70

I would try 60 motor amp, -35 motor break, 60 bat and -35 . If you break too much at -65 motor amp, I think it is too much stress for the stators dealing for such high amps... Actually I would try lower amps than 60... I would not follow the motor brand suggestions, I would start from 50 amps and change the values until you reach the spot for a balanced ride. What Batts are you using?

12s5p Li ion. Board worked fine before the upgrade. Before it had Vesc6 and 6384 200kv at 80A. I‚Äôm not sure why these motors are getting so hot. What‚Äôs ‚Äúnormal‚Äù temperature for a motor like this?

```
When I use 130kv motors, I run them at lower amps, they are efficient and they get the stator saturated if you manage the amps that you would use with a 200kv motor. Also, if you full charge your batteries and then you go riding and breaking a lot, or just downhill with a full charge, all that energy has to go some where, creates heat, and your battery is saturated, therefore your motors will work as dissipators, and you will hit the red zone very fast...you could set up the limit at 100 C grades, but I would rather set it at 80 C, because magnets suffers a lot at continuous high temps....I suggest you to try lower amps 45 motor amp -25 break, and 45 batt and amps to start, obviously carefully because you are experimenting, and you will reach the perfect spot with patience. Wish you the best...

I tried lowering the settings today, it longer but eventually reached the thermal limit again.  Ive noticed the temperature jumps around alot at the higher temperatures (60C and above).  also when temperatures are 80C i can still touch the motors with my hand for a short time.  Wouldnt 80C give me an instant burn?

By touching the motor by hand, you mean the bell? I touch the lateral (sprocket and shaft) if that burn my hand immediately , there temps are too high. But the bell it is always dissipation heat, therefore they are not too accurate. Few questions, do you have belts? if they are ti tight motors heat up rapidly. Do you have motor cover? same problem, they need air. Do you loose power when motor heat up? thats the proof vescs are saving them from burning. How is the weather? Too hot will heat motor fast. How is your riding style? accelerating and a lot of breaking aggressively will heat your motors. Also, 80 C do not burn my fingers instantly. If there is no answer, best try to talk with Bruno from APS, maybe he can help you, also Frank from Trampa. PM them or email.

I would try Frank first. Ive been told there havnt been many, if any, VESC 6s that go bad overtime.

Thats not to pin blame on you though, it sounds as though its the motor, and something within it thats wonky.

Hi, 
I really appreciate the helpful comments, I have an etoxx gear drive, so no belts. I have been in contact with APS, on my previous setup I had Vesc 6 and APS 6384s 200kv. I blew a Vesc 6 up last month and ordered two new Vesc 6+ along with two APS 6384s 170kv motors. The new 170kv motors have a completely closed bell while my old ones had a vented bell. I thought this might be a factor but APS assures me that the enclosed bell should be okay.  I am losing power when the motors get hot, Vesc‚Äôs are throwing a motor temp fault.  The weather here is mild for now(Arizona) it‚Äôs a high of about 80-85F here currently.  My riding style isn‚Äôt super aggressive but I definitely enjoy accelerating hard out of some cornersü§ò.  APS said it was likely due to my geartrain (which I don‚Äôt think because it ran fine before) or timing(which I assume means Vesc settings?) I have also emailed trampa, awaiting a reply.

I am currently using the same motor min and max as well as batt min and max that I used on my 200kv that ran flawlessly never overheating for the past year. Even when it was 110F+ outside.  Also my friend has the exact same setup running the 170kv motors only difference is he is using focbox.

It just doesn‚Äôt make just sense to me, it takes about a mile or two to reach the temp limit then severely cuts power to protect motors.

I read your thread and I can't see something standing out.

Lower kv motors normally can't handle the current higher kv handle due to more turns in the winding.
However your motors have a lower resistance than all of my 6374 motors and I don't have major overheating problems with mine.

The only thing I can suggest, is to make sure you redo you motor detection, make sure temperature compensation is off and recheck all your motor phase connections.

Fw 3.52 had temperature compensation on by default during detection and it caused a few problems with some motors.
If you have FW 3.54, unless you activated it yourself, it should not be on.

```

---
## \#31 Posted by: taz Posted at: 2019-05-17T16:33:44.720Z Reads: 86

```
The beta value is a constant that depends on the characteristics of the thermistor used.

I don't know if motor manufacturers use various NTC thermistors with values that are different to the standard value in the vesc tool, but if that is the case, then this means that the temperature reported differs from the actual one.

You would only need to adjust this value if the vesc tool reports eg 80C when the actual temperature is 60C.

Considering that your motor temperature climbs from 60C to 80C very fast, I don't think this is your problem.

```
You definitely need to adjust the beta factor, since the function is logarithmic a small error produces a big error in the temperature reading 

Measure resistance and temperature and resistance at two different temperatures and put them in the calculator bellow

The best way I‚Äôve found with built in temperature sensor is to use a hair dryer and let it heating the motor for at least half and hour or more to stabilize, just be careful that some hair dryers will get things way too hot and damage the motor

It seams to be a NTC 10K, which is what you want. If temp spikes up that fast something is funny somewhere. Question is: is the motor really getting war that fast, or is it a measurement issue.
sure the Thermistor is connected to temp and GND?

Probably 3950 is the beta value of your thermistor, adjust it in vesc tool and try, normally the thermistor is placed on the stator, the hottest part, it will be very different to the temperature of the motor can.

The motor takes about 2 miles of riding to reach motor temp fault, a little longer if I ride it gently and little sooner if I ride it hard. It appears the thermistor is attached properly.

So I am back with the board and still having motor temp faults. APS was very nice to me and sent over two of the vented style rotors just like my old 200kv motors. I am getting about 6 miles of regular riding in now before motors hit temp limit. Which is much better then the closed style rotor but something is still not right. Does anyone have any suggestions? 

12s5p li ion
Vesc 6+
APS 6384S 170kv with vented style rotor
Etoxx 1:5 gear drive

Motor max: 70a
Motor brake: -70a

Bat max: 60a
Bat regen: -60a

My sealed maytech 170kv motors hit soft cut off temp of 85C within 9km.

Seems pretty normal to me.

I never had this issue till I rebuilt my board with new motors and VESC‚Äôs.  I cannot find the issue and was hoping someone here might be able to help
