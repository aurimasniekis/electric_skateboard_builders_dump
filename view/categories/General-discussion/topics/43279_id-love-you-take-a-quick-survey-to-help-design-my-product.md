Thanks for all your ideas on what I should make for my Product design challenge! 

I've decided that I'm going to go ahead with designing and prototyping a longboard charging station and therefore I need to do some research so if you could spare a minute to answer these questions it will really help :smiley:
If you could post anything after this post to keep this thread alive, would be appreciated ;)

Thanks
Doug

Survey completed, though I think some more options would have been nice in my case. I take my batteries out to charge but would rather not. Couldn't say that on the survey

Why do you take them out? If you don't have to?

Yes, I had thought of this, thinking of making something a bit more robust with more options

I do have to, but I will be making some changes so I don't. Survey asked if I do (and I ticked that box) but I'd like to express that I'd like a charging option where I didn't need to.

I think an awesome way of charging would be a wall mount that goes around the truck and there's contacts on the trucks so the board just charges when it's on the mount. But more realistically a cool way to store and charge my board would be awesome.

Thats so weird!! I was just thinking about that sort of solution for the temperature sensor for inside the board and then thought why dont we charge the boards like that too!

Brilliant thanks :D I will make a build log or something to show what comes of this!

Survey complete.  What about a free standing station that holds boards upright. That way you could move it to a different location if necessary.  Could attach chargers or have a spot to set the charger.  Just another thought.

I was considering trying to make it both wall mountable and floor standing, but I have to say the majority of people would prefer a wall mounted one

I know what you mean. I was thinking it sits against the wall. Maybe attach if you want. But otherwise able to move other places.

Ahh gotcha, so it's safer than just leaning the board against the wall

A ton of the people in Cities who live in apartments can't wall mount. I'd love the look of a wall mounted e-board charger, but I cant do it due to my lease agreement.

So not like this. But free standing like this.  So it can go against the wall.

Maybe make one like the bookshelves that lean against the wall... they look kinda like a ladder. 

Make it tall, like 5 or 6 feet. Put your gear or books or whatever on the shelves above.
