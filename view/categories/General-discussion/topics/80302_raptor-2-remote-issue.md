Hi everyone,
Yesterday I shut down my raptor 2.
I turn on raptor 2 this morning.
The nano x remote Control no response.
So I replaced another brand new nano x.
It work but the  accelerate very slow and Throttle neutral point will give some brake.
Does anyone experiences this issue before?
Could someone provide the solution

Have you tried contacting enertion support? Do you have a raptor 2 or 2.1?

There's a small switch on the back of the nano-x that when flipped up is in slow mode and when flicked down is in fast mode.

What color shows on the LED when turned on? 
What color shows when plugged into charger?

Is it in slow mode? 
You also may need to calibrate it in the tool.
