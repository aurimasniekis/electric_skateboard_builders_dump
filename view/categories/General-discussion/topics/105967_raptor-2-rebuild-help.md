I am one of the sad raptor 2 owners (rip) who received their board, but now it seems that enertion has gone out of business and will no longer be honoring warranty parts or selling parts. I am looking for a reliable replacement for the motors or drive kit where sustainable wheel purchases can be made. Does anyone have recommendations for something that I could swap the raptor trucks and motors out with to make a franken-raptor?
