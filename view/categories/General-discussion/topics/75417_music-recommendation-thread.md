Not sure if this has been discussed before, but what do y'all like to listen to while working on the board, doing the dishes, or chillin out after work?

Specific songs or bands/artists work.


I'll start:

the Lumineers, Mumford & Sons, or Three Days Grace

If you like lumineers and Mumford look up Langhorne slim. You have probably heard his songs but didn’t know it he has had songs in this is us, a coke commercial that played during the super bowl 2 years ago a few car commercials and recently a dick sporting goods commercial with the ping pong table.

As for was I listen to it depending. Sometime sublime and bob marley sometimes slayer sometimes the casualties or other punk

Karma To Burn 
Mighty riffery without the distraction of lyrics, typically a great work music for me!

Mainly go for focus beats while riding but generally love all music sans country.

If I'm feeling thug enough I go with my boy Atmosphere. 
If I'm feeling classic rock it's Zepplin baby

I've never really been big on 21pilots. Probably because I just can't stand that guy's voice.

Shout out to all those rocking the classic punk, primus, aphex twin (Richard James is a genius), and the jungle like techno. Was really feeling that Chon track. But where’s all the 80’s/90’s hip hop? That’s gotta be represented here...

Whenever I get questions about music I need to think, here's what I've listened to in the last few weeks, but Damn it changes too quickly.
Working:
System of a down
Turisas
Eminem
Current 93
Shinedown
Red Hot chilli peppers
Three days grace
Hollywood undead
Disturbed
Five finger death punch 

And while I'm riding (bike or unmotorized board) a mainly shit like these
Grandson 
Bohnes
Sickick
Neffex

Grandson has some great stuff, although Blood in the Water is by far my favorite.

Another artist to check out; Lostboycrow. He is criminally underrated.
