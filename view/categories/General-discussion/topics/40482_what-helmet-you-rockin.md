Mountain bike. The chin bar is removable. Idea was that you can use it as a normal helmet riding up and put on the chin part flying down the hill

I've used it for a week or so and it's been great. It didn't get warm in there, glasses didn't fog up and no condensation inside the mask (which you can very easily take of and that brings me to my next point).

It's quite cold here in Switzerland right now so can't say but you can take of the mask and googles and just put some sunglasses on. 

When I received it, I walked around in it for like 20 minutes (inside) to get a good feel for it, and it wasn't too hot.

I think you'll be disappointed with any bike helmet except downhill MTB or motocross. As downhill MTB and motocross have wide FOV(field of view) like downhill longboarding helmets. 

Motorcycle helmets are designed to look forward as you have mirrors... Terrible for shoulder peaking.

Just my opinion.

@Rutherford  Built in visor mostly. Most MTB helmets will need retrofitting.

The visor is the best part of a full face(aside from the obvious extra protection) as it keeps rocks off your face. Dust and bugs out of your eyes etc. 

I have one scratch on my pass visor. It's because I hit a dragonfly at 35mph. Couldn't imagine not having a visor now.

They're both called visors... Because they block the sun.

I get it the pull down piece, they're typically called face shields... But face shields are always clear. Either way. Two terms with basically interchangeable meanings


But you won't find a replacement "tsg face shield" as tsg doesn't call them that...

I think you‚Äôll be disappointed with any bike helmet except downhill MTB or motocross. As downhill MTB and motocross have wide FOV(field of view) like downhill longboarding helmets.

Motorcycle helmets are designed to look forward as you have mirrors‚Ä¶ Terrible for shoulder peaking.

But to add to that...if you get a motorcycle helmet..that is under 1300 grams... It's probably ok..but it's gonna suck.. because you can't see shit or hear shit.

@SimosMCmuffin reading your accident analysis post was when I was finally pushed over the fence in buying one. 

Had the money for a dual drive upgrade but then realised that dual drive is useless if I'm too injured to ride it.  

 By the way, I went for a tighter fit (medium). It's normal that it's really tight as it slides over your head right? @Deckoz

Yea, there's a little spot where your ears go. Feels very nice and snug with the pads pressing on your jaw.
I heard that it doesn't come with a carrying bag but mine came with quite a nice black string back. Even had a special pocket for the clear visor.
My only gripe is that the straps are so close to your neck that it's uncomfortable, even with the padding over it. But maybe that's a good thing

Wear the strap a little loose. If something wants it off your head it would pull till the button stop. So no harm not having it super tight.

The head/cushion fitment should keep it mostly in place without choking yourself :)

This is an awesome thread.  I've learned alot and it helps me towards my search for full face helmets for my son and I.

I'm not a hement expert.  But as a former lifeguard with knowledge of how diving accidents cause spinal injuries,  those forehead visors worry me.  At a glance they appear to be something that could contribute to a hyper extension injury.

![image|606x418](upload://6r50odUxt0yqDaHXzNvDFxR6Vdo.jpg)

Do those visors break away on impact.   Back in 1992, I was just out of university and working as a shop hand in a design firm that was working on bike helments.  I had no authority or helment expertise, but I saw one design that had vents on the top of the helmet that looked to me like a snag risk during a fall.  I pointed out the risk of those vents  catching and rolling the head backwards.  The design was scrapped. That does not prove I was right -- only that some helmet designers took my comments seriously three decades ago.

However the majority of helmets do seem to feature a very slippery centreline and recessed vents.  Those sun visors look to me like a snag risk that could catch and roll the head backwards.  

So I'll ask again. Are they break away. 

Everything else I see on this thread is confidence inspiring.  I appreciate the pointers on disadvantages of motorcycle helments towards visibility, weight, etc.

Specific to the Bell Super xR, I think the visor would bend or yield on impact. It's there to keep the sun out of your eyes, but is fixed with two adjustable screws, which would undoubtedly yield or break off under high impact. It's not a structural component by any means
Edit: ...and it's totally removable

Agreed, the Bell 3R looked to favor break away.  Other ones like these lookes a little scary.  Not just the sun visor but the forward angled vents/air scoops.

I'm thinking for those that have not gone to full face but don't have hundreds of dollars, maybe this thread could discuss more budget options.

My son wants a down hill longboard racng helment.  I'm thinking motocross.  I can afford to spend the money on a TSG or Bell.  Not everyone can though.

But if I wanted to spend low for something cool looking, I'd be drawn to these in particular:

for < 15 MPH Ruroc RG-1 with DX Shockwave audio is my preference for exploring cities.  The speaker sits in the back of the helmet leaving your ears mission-capable.

for 16-25 MPH: TSG Pass Carbon.  I'd never heard of this helmet until finding this forum; it's good, not great.  I think it's the perfect Boosted Board helmet.

for > 25 MPH: Shoei X-SPIRIT 3 Assail, my fave.  Vents in all the right places and it's much quieter than both the above at speed (Shoei FTW @ ~130 MPH via GSX-R750).

I assume I could use regular 3m car tint, this tint is made to be put on from the inside and the visor is quite small so I wouldn't need much and should be easy.

It was dual 6355 at the time completely stock. My Raptor 2 rolls almost as well as a normal board I've kick pushed it down my block for fun and it felt great under manual power.

I was able to order my wife a TSG pass, she saw how obsessed i was with these things so she went out and bought a boosted board.

I replaced the clear lens with a dark smoke lens, and also took off the front visor. the shield has a very satisfying clonk when you close it also.

She didn't want me to build her one like I'm doing now, she likes having the mass produced and tested and "safe" option. And the guys at the local skate shop here saved the last one that had a loaded deck and she loves her loaded decks.

Its her first time ever riding so she didn't want anything crazy...I want to go fast! But its nice she will have something to cruise with me on.

I can't honestly remember the last time I wore a helmet for more than a minute.

I ordered first XL as everybody said it¬¥s smaller than they advertise.
I needed to send the helmet back to get one in L.
58cm head, fit now super perfect.
I didn¬¥t took it for a ride yet, but it¬¥s super light too.
field of view similar to the switchblade.
my chin is very close to the helmet front, so I needed to take out the small neoprene bumber, but now it¬¥s fine.
I like that you can adjust the helmet size with the switchblade.
that¬¥s missing on the TSG.
on both I don¬¥t like the locker (sorry don¬¥t know the right word in english) the meachnism how to close the helmet.
No way to open it with gloves or frozen fingers in the winter. :rofl:
maybe there is a trick for it, but I didn¬¥t find out yet...

For the TSG you can get a lot of air in with the visor opened in the summer time... I like to keep just a little opened while riding to get more air flow.

As for sweating in your helmet, that's just nasty as you do it repetitively and don't really have the ability to wash it. I highly suggest these "Headsweat" helmet liners. I've used it for like 20 years since biking days

Anyone got recommendations for XXL full face helmets with visor? 

Tried a XL size TSG Pass without cheek pads, still small for me.

This manufacturer from Italy is doing XXL 63cm-64cm helmets.
Their sizing is also better.

If you are interested in, I fly every 1-2 month from Germany to SoCal and can bring you one in XXL.

Only have had it for about a week. Two mountainbike rides and a couple longboard trips on it. No mountain board yet. Fits well, very light, lots of ventilation. Love the features. Not as heavy duty as a Motorcross helmet but that s not what I was looking for.

@klaus79856  I will definitely take a look at them,  thanks for the suggestion!  

@Skunk The visor is kinda of necessary to me, because my eyes got pretty watery and I have eaten couple unknown bugs alone the way...... If there are really no other options, I will take a closer look into them! Thanks for the suggestion!

Thought I should share this. 
Saw these on sale for a good deal. This is a $300+ dollar helmet for $104. I‚Äôve not used their mtn bike gear, but I do have a bit of moto gear from ixs and I think it‚Äôs quality stuff. 
They don‚Äôt have my size and I like my helmet but I did order one for a friend.

I got a sweet deal on a base model ruroc. I never liked visors so it was an easy buy for me.

Still trying to find a lightweight, fox proframe style, dual visor (main visor, and inner RoboCop style) full face helmet.

I think they might not exist tho :(

All these lightweight style downhill helmets are used with goggles.
With dual visor you mean a second integrated sun visor ?
You will find these only at motorcycle helmets and they have at least 50% more weight.

Yeah, I found proper search terminology last night and figured that out. I think the lightest helmet with dual lenses I could actually find that wasn't complete trash was 1400g.

I might have to go with a switchblade or fox proframe for the time being and put a quish release buckle on some goggles.

And honestly, being a glasses wearer for the time being... I'd probably look like a mega-dork with dual lenses.

Can anybody with goggles give me a general weight of them? An Amazon listing for fox standard goggles says they weigh .8oz. which is 22 grams. Which is four US .25c pieces. I doubt that.
