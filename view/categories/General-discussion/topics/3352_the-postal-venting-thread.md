so this is a thread for venting about how the post office screws you around.

kinda like how my package is at the station for my area and has been since Saturday yet they still haven't sent it out to me.

i've stopped using UPS, ordered 100$ of parts from SDI-SI, got charged  an extra 80$ of handling and brokerage garbage on top of the 30$ shipping.

That's interesting.  I've never had a problem with UPS.  Do you live in the US?

It's unfortunate that other countries have to deal with stupid shit like that.

never ship ups or fedex for cross border stuff.

there is paper work that needs to be done for stuff entering the country that usps does for free.

i had to fill out a lot of paperwork for customs shipping motors to europe using usps.  they need to come up with a system where you can do it all online.  its a huge time suck going in there, waiting in line, filing out paperwork.
