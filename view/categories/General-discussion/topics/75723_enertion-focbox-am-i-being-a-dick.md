So after reading on here I decided to purchase a Focbox.  Placed a order on the 19th and paid $210AUD for it, now 4 days later they just dropped the price to $136AUD. I contacted support and was told its the black friday sale that I should have known about apparently. And that I should have contacted support first before placing the order like everyone else does. And as my item has been shipped I am not entitled to anything due to their terms and conditions. During the conversation I got emailed the shipping confirmation and the shipping is still pending. I was looking at the Raptor for new years but id hate to have a warranty issue. So are they always like this? Or am I being a Dickhead? Here is my conversation with customer support.

I have to say that sounds frustrating.

However,  I don't think it is unfair or anything.  A little research and you would have known to wait.

You can't expect them to retroactively give discounts.  Where would it end?

But, who knows @CarlCollins is responding right now.

@Pete75
Black Friday sale is something which happens in November (almost every year)
So if your order is already dispatched before it or if you placed your order before the sale
There is no way to refund the order just for the sale (after it gets shipped).
2ndly, to get the news updates, you have to subscribe to our newsletter, Facebook, YouTube or Instagram
I have checked our system and you haven't subscribed to any of these.

We have Live chat support for you guys, hit them and ask them about the discounts, sales etc.

Anyways, I am adding $50 AUD store credits to your account 

If you want to return the item then you can return it but as per the terms, you have to cover the shipping charges.

**Just an advise, Please follow our newsletters and social media to stay up to date with our promotions and discounts.**
**Our system only works if your email is in the system otherwise there is no way you will be getting an information about the promotions.**

Also, you can't return an item saying that price got discounted now, because there will be many more promotions coming up so you will be in the position of always returning the stuff :stuck_out_tongue:

That was good of you Carl but I really don't think it was necessary. Buyers remorse shouldn't cost enertion in this case

Whatâ€™s that beautiful leather thing you have there?! I canâ€™t afford one. I use a ðŸ“Ž 

Thatâ€™s awesome @CarlCollins itâ€™s always great when vendors become human and see the pain from the consumerâ€™s side. 

I have to agree that you shouldâ€™ve seen that coming. Most of us have been holding back on spending just for todayâ€™s splurge.

You'd be the best if you did! I'd buy another focbox right now! I'm not expecting anything. I think it's really nice you already gave that guy some money back when you certainly were in the right saying no!
