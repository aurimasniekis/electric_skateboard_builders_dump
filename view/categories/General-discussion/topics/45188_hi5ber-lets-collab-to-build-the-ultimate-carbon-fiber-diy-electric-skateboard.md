What‚Äôs up everybody! Brian here from Hi5ber Boards. In case you haven‚Äôt heard, I make some of the sickest fully carbon fiber longboards/skateboards available on the market. Check it out: [www.hi5ber.com](http://www.hi5ber.com) . I started making boards back in 2011, and have made considerable progress with my manufacturing and the business since then. I‚Äôve designed upwards of 25+ models, pushing out 6-10 or so new shapes each year. I have a strong passion for 3D modeling and bringing my CAD designs to life. I repeatedly get emails from customers looking to convert their Hi5ber board into an electric one, as well as looking for any recommendations of which of my existing boards would be best. I joined this forum to get some input from the electric skateboard community on developing a DIY friendly ‚Äúshell‚Äù of a board, designed specifically for electric skateboard builders. I think we, as a collaborative effort, can make the ultimate carbon fiber electric board! If you'd like to contribute to the collaboration, please give any information on what you think would be the ultimate e-board. Things like: length, width, wheelbase, general shape, enclosure dimensions*, etc.

Thanks for the input! Consider me to be totally ignorant when it comes to electric boards. What is 10S and 12S? What size enclosure would it take to fit 60 of these batteries? Length x Width x Depth...

Welcome, I love to see manufacturer's come here for input.  I would say the 2 most important aspects would be concave, probably a tub, and a built in enclosure with wire channels.  If you made that I bet you would sell as many as you could make.  Hell, I'd by 2 at the beginning.

Holy $hit @scepterr looks like we are in luck. Our favorite deck maker is here!

@Hi5ber I love the Zenith‚Äôs size and concave.  @Eboosted is currently making a custom enclosure for it.

If you look up the original Enertion Raptor. That‚Äôs the CF deck that I like to use. It opens up from the top for components and the lid is Kevlar I think? Because CF would block the signal from our controller 

Not sure whose image this is, but he had measurements written on his 10s3p battery (with huge BMS, Switch & LCD) 80mm x 140mm, then the rest of that room is for ESCs and receiver

I like the idea for wire channels!
[/quote]

I would definitely keep it simple. I would suggest a single large channel or 4 small channels on each side of the back truck that follow a rounded path to the inside of the enclosure.  Or, and this may be easier, just make the enclosure overlap the slots for the phase wires so you have internal access to them.  

[quote="Hi5ber, post:8, topic:45188"]
built-in enclosure with a detachable lid
[/quote]

That sounds awesome.  

Another aspect I would look at is making a slor in the lid for a volt meter.  You could standardize the volt meter shape by using [this](https://www.amazon.com/DROK-Capacity-Lead-acid-Indicator-Electric/dp/B071HW4QHL/ref=sr_1_37?ie=UTF8&qid=1517433354&sr=8-37&keywords=dc+volt+meter) Drok DV Volt meter and either sell it with the enclosure or point people too it.  Maybe add a blank that screws in/out for people that do not want a volt meter, although I doubt there would be many.

I think a simple CF deck with a top opening that can be sealed with a gasket would be ideal. It would make the board very resistant to water, and would allow easy access to electronics.

I say the optimal size is 38" and maybe 9-10" wide for a longboard. Perhaps a wheel base of about 30", and no kicktail. The reason for no kicktail is that larger boards are usually dual or quad drive with big batteries, so you need as much space as possible to accomate that, and can't afford to lose space to a kicktail.

Or make a cruiser that is maybe 28-30" long with a smaller compartment (cruisers usually have smaller batteries) and a kickball.

I'm of the same opinion as b264 on battery size, 60 is indeed perfect.

Also design the board to allow maximum turn radius with 107mm wheels and/or 6 to 8 " pneumatic wheels without needing risers to avoid wheel bite.

@Hi5ber, hey Brian and welcome.
Consider making a small cruiser board around 27in.
With a top enclosure cover. Inner size could be 33 x 140 x 330mm. This way you could fit a 10S2P flat pack 18650 cells (20 cells) and a BMS, plus 2x VESC and receiver, like this one from eskating.eu 
 ![Electric-skateboard-10s2p-battery-lithium-power-pack-Eskating|656x241](upload://waqYUeCfGVGF6MqRpvaJsZBZfDY.jpg)
A shape like penny nickel or LOU board but sexier, with a kicktail. Maybe even a 27in drop through deck (that's my wild imagination ahahah)

eMTB aside... all the decks I ride are downhill, 25-27 inches skateboard wheelbase ~34 inches long and up to 10' wide. The trend is for bigger batteries so make as much space as you can for storage.

I'd follow the downhill model with the exception of making the deck a bit wider, eSk8s need to be safe and stable. This could accommodate more cells and also give you a bit more leverage over the trucks with the super wide trucks that are being used to fit in motors. If done right it could be a win/win. Nothing too crazy an extra 1/2 a inch to a inch and you will also make more battery space.

not sure if even possible but the surface that would be in contact with electronics be NOT carbon fiber as it's conductive.  i remember someone building a CF enclosure and shorting out their battery.

@Titoxd10001 build a CF enclosure but the final layer, on the inside, was fiberglass.

awesome that you join us.

So in the past, lot forgot the basic needs a deck has for the rider. To much focus on form and space for batteries.
So for me I nee a solid rocker running trough the whole deck, for a stable ride yet comfy enough for long cruises.
Wheel flares would be useful since most of us runs gigantic wheels 90mm +. W concave is loved by some hated by others. So that can be added via implants later on.

I think the range model be best, you could stack 2170's if needed and have space for plenty of VESC especially for those of us who will be running a 4WD setup.  I would prefer it if it was a slight drop down style, but other than that I think this style is perfect!

I have an aluminum deck I've messed with for months and never got it to ride right (no concave). When printing the enclosure I was also getting a Jeep CJ7 tun think lined. I got them to spray the enclosure as well. And expensive solution normally but in this instance it was free.

Totally agree! Lid on top!  Also just making an enclosure that only fits 50 cells is to small.  I'm going to be running a Carvon 4WD and that needs a minimum of 60 (12s5p), and me personally I plan on making like a 12s7p, not too mention 4 VESC's will be needed along with everything else.

My point is the enclosure should be big enough so we aren't limited in such ways. Making a board enclosure that is specifically designed for a certain amount of batteries and VESC greatly limits you and your configuration options.

I know CF blocks the receiver so would it be ok to use fiber glass instead?  Or wood with a layer of fiber glass or aluminum? 

Another option I was thinking is do the lid CF but have a little cut out that we could attach the receiver to and just cover it up with a piece of wood or something.

Or just don't ride in wet conditions since you really shouldn't anyway.  Or just make sure to wipe down the lip of the lid when you open it, since it most likely won't be opened out while your riding.  Additionally you could line the edges of the enclosure with an absorbent sponge or something similar, making them removable so you can dry them when needed.

Ok your argument is absurd.  Comparing a car which is the main transport for most people to an Esk8 which granted, some people use for their main transport, but I think for most of us this is for fun /hobby, or getting somewhere from a bus that's a mile or so too complete the way home. As for your comments about driving a car in the snow I'm just going to ignore as it's clearly meant to start an argument.
I guess my point is, the board shouldn't be made to the specifications of a rather small portion of the population, but to the needs of the majority.

I'm with you. IMO, what the majority of eskate DIYs will want:

- integrated enclosure of some sort, hold 50 cells with room for 2 ESCs, bms, receiver, etc. This also gives us big wheelbase for stability at speed.
- wire channels of some sort
- enclosure opens up without unscrewing 30 screws. splash resistant.
- room between enclosure and rear truck for inside mounted motors
- mounting panel for charge port, switch, vesc usb passthrough, XT90S loop key, etc.
- we tend to run big wheels. 90mm, 97mm, 107mm. So some kind of wheel clearance. And most of the motor mounts are designed around caliber fifty trucks.
- maaaybe some mount points for lights, front and back. Like flat spots on bottom near trucks
- badass looks (from what I've seen you can't help it)
- cheap as hell (this one's a joke)

And thanks @Hi5ber for popping in! Exciting.

I never said anything to discourage people from riding in the least.  I'm just cautioning about riding in the rain as that is usually a good way to mess up your bearings, and a lot of motors aren't waterproof so I'm also trying to help in that regard, but if you want to risk it, don't let me stop you, but regardless of where the lid is, if it's raining and your riding, you have a much higher chance of ruining your motors and bearings long before any water could get inside to do its damage.

Dear @Hi5ber, thank you for reaching to us!

I'd suggest the following ideas : 

- We need a kick tail for the city, it is a pain to ride without it
- We need a W concave for easy foot placement because it will go fast
- It must sit as low as possible when mounted on trucks like Caliber 2 (most used model) to provide the most possible "analog" feel, people can always choose to put risers later
- The lid of the enclosure should actually be on the bottom because **instead of making multiple deepness in the deck, you can offer various lid sizes, flat or bulky,  to accommodate for any battery packs sizes** ; if you put the lid on top you won't be able to cause it would mess up with the whole deck. 

Rest of the proposed ideas are pretty good too. 

Since there seems to be a disagreement on kick tail, maybe propose both offerings? 

Wish you a good development.

That's awesome you're here @Hi5ber I was actually looking at your decks but wound up going with a different brand. I'd definitely say kick tails are important to me with city commuting. I was also looking at carbon fiber specifically for the weight. Maybe you can do 2 versions, a longboard without the kick tail and a shortboard that includes the kick tail.  Definitely enough space to fit large wheels, easily accessible innards... 

You've already got sexy down. I've noticed a lot of the larger boards tend to have more flat decks. But a lot of us also prefer Concave so not sure about that. I think some type of channel for the motor wires coming from the trucks to the enclosure with maybe a panel to cover them up would be cool. This maybe difficult, but past the battery section, where the vescs and receiver goes the enclosure top could change to a different material to help with the receiver signal.

I think the enclosure should open from the bottom just for the sake of having a Concave built in to the deck rather than a move able part, but what do I know. I break everything ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

I am also in for a deck if the enclosure length is at least 650mm. That's enough for a big BMS, 2 VESC's and a 12s4p/10s5p battery.

Let's have it so we can at least get 60 batteries, that works well for both 10s and 12s.  50 is not enough for 12s...

Also we should consider that a lot of us will probably start to use the new 2070 and 2170's cells now instead of 18650...

Seeing how you have many models/styles to choose from already. It appears having multiple design molds isn‚Äôt to costly for you. Just my guess. 

Id look into having a kick tailed and non kicktailed for preference and 36in and 42in lengths. And so long as your bottom of deck is flat for the compartment, a W concave sounds great. Obviously it‚Äôs a mess if the top and bottom of deck are wavy, the battery assembly will be a pain. 

The idea of different sized lids for the battery compartments seems clever too. For bottom of deck.
Have a near flush fit for probly 40 batteries, a bms and 2 esc‚Äôs. And a bigger one for 60 batts. 

I‚Äôd recommend listening to the enthusiasts and high end crowd mostly as well. Seeing as you are making $200 decks already. Your customers aren‚Äôt exactly the budget consumers.

I think we should just choose a few from here and then they could develop them with an enclosure. 

I really like the Makako, Lotus, Azure, Raptor, Zenith, Overtaker, Undertaker, Incisors, and Jalepano.

My favorites being the Raptor, Lotus, and Makako. I like the dimensions of the Makako the most, but I think the Lotus and Raptor look so damn good and fun!

I was looking through your current deck offerings and I think the Lotus may be the perfect form factor to start with. 

It's 36x10im, the average longboard dimensions. It has cutouts for big wheels.  A 3/4im radial(?) concave.   

Using your existing plug and adding the enclosure and other mods may be the easiest and cheapest way to get started.

I'd love to see an electric Hi5ber Raptor!  I've been riding that deck for a couple of years, with 4 hub motors, but now I'm pondering enclosures for my belt setup.  I'm having mount clearance issues, and will have to get something shorter or much lower profile than my old Sulaco enclosure.

@hi5ber, maybe also consider offering board specific molded carbon fiber enclosures that attach to the bottoms of your current models?:grin:  Those flanges on your deck make great mounting points for screws or magnets.![26 PM|690x179](upload://3uKdZAc86AesO1YWOheZ3b87m5h.png).

if they were to thicken the "ribs" on the bottom of the board that go lengthwise it could have compartments for the cells, but leave the "ribs" that go the length of the board the same thickness then it would hugely increase rigidity in just the side to side direction but keep the same slight bendability with the length of the board.   They could do the same deck and same layup and have the same feel.    wont feel like riding a brick.

It mounts using the flares at the sides with nut inserts and screws, the prototype was made out of hardened foam and then shaped with sandpaper and a lot of patience, after the prototype is done I use fexible resin, hardener and fiberglass sheets.

No one mentioned anything about battery sizes being the limiting factor of the compartment shape. At a minimum, the compartment should be 160mm wide and 25mm depth because of the 21700 cell format. The depth may be deeper because of the speed controller.

I like the idea of the bottom mounted enclosure with different depth options. Like almost flat or flush with board for single layer 18650's and a 1/2"-1" deeper version for stacked packs, larger cells or even Lipos. I could see having a shorter range, lighter board with the lowest profile box, and another thicker enclosure with more batteries for longer range that could be swapped easily. I'd take a page from @whitepony' s book and make recess in the board for the enclosure  flange, so the enclosure edge is flush with the bottom of the deck. Should make it pretty easy to waterproof as well.

Hi Brian, 
I'm late to the party here...I sometimes make enclosures and was wondering if you had any scrap or waste decks. If you do, I could use them to make the flanged base area of my enclosure molds. Then there would be an abs offering for many different battery configurations and component choices without having to design a goofy compartment and lid into your deck.

I've already made enclosures for a few of your decks, but wasn't totally happy with the interface between the enclosure and the belly of your beasts. If you're down, I could make a few enclosures that will fit your decks perfectly.

Here is a little render of what I've got going on so far. I'm basing the shape off an existing model I offer, the Makako. It's super comfortable, one of our best sellers, has won awards, and is probably my favorite board and what I personally carry in the trunk of my car. I designed the bottom of the board yesterday and today, and will tackle the top cutout of the enclosure soon. 

Specs: L:40" W:10" Wheelbase: 30" Rocker: 0.5"
Integrated battery compartment should accommodate 12S4P and 10S5P of 18650, as well as a BMS, antisparkswitch, charger port, battery capacity tester, wires. Enclosure depth is 1".

Keep in mind this is a mockup and some modifications are likely. Comments and suggestions welcome! After the completion of this board, I want to begin designing an esk8 version of our Ion-30 cruiser :wink:

The Makako looks like a good start with the general design of wheel cutouts and deck concave. I think the 25mm max thickness is reasonable given battery and ESC alternatives which are available.

I think we all agree it should be sleek and stealthy as possible without compromising performance. I do agree with @Pedrodemio that the ‚Äòlip‚Äô on the edge on the top surface of the deck tends to suggests that the battery compartment is smaller than it could potentially be.

Perhaps if you taper the edge of the deck, (like how it is done with the M1), so there wouldn‚Äôt be an apparent or obvious bulge where the enclosure would ordinarily be?

What about those of us who want to make a 4WD?  Not only would we need additional space for the two extra VESC's, but we would need 12s5p at least.  I don't think an additional 10mm is so much that it would be noticed.  That's also just double stacking for 18650's, not 21700's.  Then we would need 42mm depth enclosure which is what is really like IMHO. Then we'd have the choice between any cell size,  18650 - 21700.  I don't think anyone is going to double stack some 26650's, lol, but the other sizes, especially the new 2170's and 2070's are probably going to become the new standard size used now.

I am actually not interested in this deck, because I prefer flexier decks...but my personally opinion is, that carbon fiber wrap around foam core will be uncomfortable for long distance rides...some structure to dampen vibrations would be nice :) Loaded use cork veneers, which could be option, or polyurethane/wood inserts in the place where trucks are mounted :) Flax fibres works well from what I have heard, but they are bit heavy :/ 

You are the pro Brian :) @Hi5ber

4wd is rather niche if going that route you should consider getting something custom made for yourself
Still 1-2 years from 20-21 cells to be anywhere near the standard being used

How many people here ride 4wd boards? Maybe 5 give or take a few. If you need a specific deck you would be best making it yourself. The most common battery setup here is 10s4p -12s4p and that still gives heaps of range and power, @Hi5ber would be much better off making for the majority than you 5

Hey, sicked to have you here with us ma man !

My 2 cents on the deck, only about its functionality not talking storage space.
In esk8 we usually run rather budget trucks, huge wheels and heavy ass set ups compared to traditional longboards. 

So for me actual control the rider has was always super lacking compared to my freeride/downhill experiences.  So I allways tried to get as much control and ride quality as possible out of my esk8 set ups. So as a personal preferece I enjoy topmounts with a solid rocker he most. Gives me more weight directly over the trucks, allowing to have somewhat a direct and fast reaction feeling from my esk8. Its hard since the enclosure (storage space) makes this hard. But I would appreciate every inch I can closer stay over my trucks greatly. Thinking along the lines of your yellow jacket.

I guess my point was it doesn't hurt to have extra space.  Better to have it and not need it, then need it but not have it.

No one has said anything about power switches, charge ports or battery meters. Do we need to open the lid up to power on and off the board? I think we should come up with a consensus on specific components so they can be installed easily and neatly. 

For power switches, I prefer old fashioned toggle switches, and led indicators for battery rather than lcd. No real preference on charge port.

Personally, I only buy sleek thin boards. The big advantage of carbon fiber is of course the weight. Like others above me have said, 4wd only caters to a small number of people.

Ok so not as many people do 4WD, fine..  I don't see how adding an extra 10mm in depth is going to ruin the design and the board overall.  It just opens up all possibilities for however you want to run your board.  Personally I don't want to have to cram everything into a small enclosure, I think we all can agree on that, so what harm is just that time extra amount of space...?  There is none!  Also, yes I think we should discuss what ports to have and where.

I agree, having the extra 10mm really is not that much, and it opens up a lot of possibilities. If it supports 4wd, great, if not, most people will not care / will still buy it. 

As for charge ports, I feel like there are so many options it may be hard to decide, but I think an xt-60 is perfect for this application, I used it on both of my builds.  Battery monitor has a lot of options too, but the Amazon one gets used a lot.

The enclosure should have no holes in it anywhere...

(truck mounts accepted)

read the tittle dudes, I'm all for fitting a decent sized battery but not for any holes in the enclosure. We can all use a drill to put them where we need them and keep it sealed up.

Come on dudes this is DIY!
Keep it flexible...

And I am all for what michi (@michichopf) had to say, give us the rocker of the yellow jacket please

otherwise like on my limelite (yes I actually have a hi5ber deck already) I need to add a footstop up front and some "W" out back to get comfy and wedged in.

I feel like I need to say this, even though it might come out a little 'asshole'.  @Hi5ber is doing us a favor by designing this board and making it available.  Its a large undertaking and the cost is substantial.  

You guys need to know that your suggestions will most likely be looked at and evaluated by the manufacturer, but this ain't a democracy.  Your demands or decisions don't carry water, the manufacturer will decide what to build as he has to weigh how many he can sell based on each suggestions.    

It may be that 99 out of 100 want a 40mm deep tray, but if @Hi5ber feels like that will cost too much and is not willing to take the risk, he wont build it that way.   If history is any teacher, 500 people will come here saying what they want and the only 20 people will order.

Say what you want or desire to see in the board and then move on or your gonna make this too difficult to work through and then it wont happen at all.

So you are speculating  in the $400 range? I think most people at the moment are spending say $80 for enclosures and $150 for a deck. If I remembered correctly, Jason had the Enertion Raptor 1 CF deck available for $400...question is how many people would invest that much money on the @Hi5ber enclosure deck at that cost?

Its no cheaper to buy the deck and get a custom enclosure made

@Mikenopolis having @Eboosteds enclosure now, I'm sure that'll go up quickly, atleast for the Zenith, it's that converting most of the hi5ber decks to esk8 is a bit cumbersome with available generic options and I think that's kept people away  
I might be getting a 2nd Zenith deck...üòã

@Hi5ber 

Hey Brian, that's a great design for an eskate. the only thing I can think of it making it top-mount just to avoid clearance problems and increase strength. Also I would make sure you retain the flat center section of the original in order to keep that comfortable flat feeling. I like how the concave is shaped it has a lot of potential and I think something like that will be the ultimate endurance board. Maybe increase the size of that center section even more. I find that having both a large flat center and abruptly contouring concave near the wheels makes for a great compromise between comfort and control and that "fun" feeling you get leveraging large flares...if you can make it flex a little with some dampening in it to help tame road vibrations, it would be much appreciated.., 

It looks like you would have a winner for best tailless design...a kicktail version would be even better so if your not going to include one in this 1st version then I would recommend the cutouts be very generous for wheels larger than 100mm...the exact same shape or mold in a elegant kicktail version would also be sick, I would prefer the kicktail myself...I would love to try any of these out when the time comes, put me down for one..

Lately I've spend very much time searching for the best parts (most durable, water resistant, mileage, etc) for a diy eskate. I developed an obsession for carbon fiber decks with build in electronics compartment. Mainly because of their huge potential for waterproofing. 

I stumbled across these decks and thought that many of you would be interested to see these. I contacted the factory for more information and shipment pricing.
If there's enough interest to match the minimum order quantity of 10, I think I can ship these to pretty much everywhere for roughly $250usd.

These boards seem really slick, but they're not exactly what I'm looking for. 
Personally I am really looking for something with a kicktail for better overal control and the ability to ollie curbs and whatever. To me, the raptor 1 deck with some minor adjustments to enhance waterproofing could be perfect, the design is really slick and has really proven itself when it comes to durability.

I have contacted enertion if they were still able to manufacture these, but they told me they are not able to do so. 
I really hope some molds or even a deck is still available as these ideas of perfecting this design won't leave my mind.

I am really considering using the same 90mm hub motors Meepo used on their Meepo board with a 10s battery. 
But this 12s performance is brutal.
