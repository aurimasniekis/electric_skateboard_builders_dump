I'm just curious as to what this ring at the base of the shaft of my motor is and what is its use? And can I remove it? - to make space for mounting my motor plate to it <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/c/9/c9e54b9924bcfbdf69f034787054d4f157958240.jpeg" width="375" height="500">

Sometimes u can omit it depending how u load the motor and on a board with pulley there's  little axial pulling so the magnets are usually enough to hold the rotor in place and u can remove it. An rc plane would be a different story. U likely are fine removing it and might show that the rotor magnets and stator teeth are not ideally aligned if without it the motor rotor ends up in a slightly different position in relation to the other part.  If it makes more noise w it off that's bad
