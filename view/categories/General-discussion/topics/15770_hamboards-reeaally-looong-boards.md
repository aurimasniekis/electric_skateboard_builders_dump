Just came across one of these Hamboards for sale locally on craigslist. Never seen one of these before. First, I lol'd, then I wondered if anyone on earth had turned one of these into an esk8. I was thinking a quad hub drive with a flexible, flat 12s20p battery might fit. Over 2kWh capacity and 100 mile range for the endless concrete wave. Wish I had the money to try this, as ridiculous and over the tip as it sounds.

I think @Michaelinvegas built a long esk8 similar (not same brand and maybe not quite as long).  Hopefully he can chime in and share pics if i'm recalling correctly?

Whole family could ride that thing...  :smile:

Yeah, I remember that one. I think that was only 55" and an actual longboard. This thing is like 78" long, 15" wide, and basically a surfboard with wheels on it. 

It's like Ahnold Schwarzenegger next to Shaq. :smile:

Well, I start to wonder where is the line between a light electric vehicle and full size electric...  :joy:

for that investment, might as well build a electric go cart thats street legal and shit. 

Longboards are for fun. not more than a 20 mile round trip

Damn, you could just lie down on it and drive around or maybe strap on a few lawn chairs for passengers :P

Now you're talking! Instead of horse rides through Central Park, you could put a seat on the back with a couple Outrigger wheels for stability and give e-longboard rides up and down Venice Beach or something. Or extreme Uber rides for hire. Lol

Hamboard was one of the first esk8!  The ABEC guy  (chris?) Built one.  Altered esk8 hardware I think.  Looks like a ton of fun, but obvs a little impractical

speak for yourself in ultra skating they go over 200 miles a session, racing. I regularly ride 50 + plus miles on my eskate..just because the industry is complacent to limited range doesn't mean you have to accept it..

Hamboards are hella fun.  I have the Pinger, the Fish and Pescadito.  With the HST trucks they carve insanely well.  It feels like surfing when you are gliding down a slight incline.   You have to ride one to feel the difference.  Smiles from ear to ear.
