If you think carefully about how to develop the best electric skateboard that you can, and put a lot of time, research, and money into the process, this article from a generally reputable news source in the US will break your heart!

Omg, that so called "article" was ridiculous. It reads like a 4th grade book report. Which should be offensive to 4th graders. It sickens me to think Janet Miller actually got paid anything for this steaming pile of horse shit. Idiot.
