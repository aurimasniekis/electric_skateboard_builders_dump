How do you guys keep your lipo charger from overheating? I'm sitting here next to mine and it hurts to touch.

Most good chargers have built in cooling fans. What brand of charger are you using?

I'd say get a decent sized heatsinc. My older  charger (which btw I've taken to hell and back) is covered with them, and I've  seen no problems for months.
