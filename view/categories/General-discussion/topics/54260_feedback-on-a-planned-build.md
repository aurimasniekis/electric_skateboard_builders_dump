I am looking for some feedback on a planned build.  I want to try to minimize expensive mistakes if I can.  If there are any builders in the Philadelphia suburbs please reach out as I woud hope to use you as a resource during this process and maybe share some spots to bo boarding. I will be a weekend warrior so use will not be everyday and I am 195 lbs...   

The base board is a dropthrough deck, with Calibar II 50 degree trucks and 83 mm Evolve wheels 

That part was easy, althoguh I needed to undermount the trucks to avoid wheel bite.  It may give me an opportunity to put the on/off swtich or battery indicator in the mount holes.  Anyone have a  plate for the top - for sale?  

I am planning to buy the following 
Motor
Maytech 6375 - 170kv motor   (I was planning on a rear mount - should I worry about clearance?) If so I could go with a 5065 270kv being sold by psychotiller?

Mount and pulleys -  If I go with the larger motor  I was thinking of a 12mm belt and 16t / 36t pulley.  Should this change if I go with a smaller motor. Was thinking of this set up https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/complete-drive-system-for-sale-formerly-motor-mount-with-dual-idlers-and-custom-made-cnc-motor-mounts/50738

ESC -  Focbox

Battery ++  Something as complete as possible - with BMS, indicator and switches,   but I have no idea on the size I will need.  I would like to be able to go 8 - 10 miles on flat surface.  Chi suggested 10s4p.   I would like recommendation on battery size and best place to buy - quality and price.  

Enclosure will depend on battery size 

Remote -  open to any sugestions -  need something as reliable as possible...
