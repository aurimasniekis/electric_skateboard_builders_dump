Its a thing of beauty that lacroix and actually good value if you live in the states.  If I wanted one it would run me nearly $5000 with import duties and exchange rates etc.  Theres only one in the country right now.  
The brothers are on the forum my friend and are good people. I'm sure they would help you out with a code if you asked.  Can't remember the tags though but look at the Lacroix group buy thread and you'll find them.
