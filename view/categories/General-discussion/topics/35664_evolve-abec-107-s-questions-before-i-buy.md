Ok before I buy these bad boys. Is anyone running them on 32t setups. I’m not trying to rip through belts, and I’m not trying to go 29mph without breaks. Has anyone ridden them, if so can you let me know what’s up! Thanks

No way in any world your going to run 107's with 32t gear your going to need a higher gear ratio such going up a hill is going to be impossibleee with 32t the minimum is 16/36 I've done with my 6355 at 107 and they were like dying

Evolve is a little different though because I’ve gone up some steep hills with 97’s on the 32t setup. I’m not sure what the stock pulley is like 15t or something?

Oh this is for your evolve bamboo. 

I'd still get a larger wheel pulley. Especially if you like high speed, torque and hills. Plus you're not exactly the smallest dude.

Ya I’m about 200lbs now since I’ve hit the gym hard lately. Ya I’d never run 107’s on my diy unless it’s just for a high speed drag run. Wouldn’t want to blow my vesc’s up.

If y'all can wait a week, I will be writing up about the 107mm on a 32T, 36T and 38T pulley on an Evolve GT

My 107's come today, and all I have are the evolve 32T pulleys. I ride 30 miles per day, so I'll be able to give you some good info tomorrow after my ride to/from work.

For anyone wondering. I just got to work, 12 mile ride. These things are definitely the best urethane iv'e ever ridden on. However, the **38T pulley is a must.** Even my custom battery was sagging heavily on full acceleration. When I checked, it was drawing the full 65 amps quite often. 

Anyone riding with the stock evolve battery will have almost unusable sag  during full speed acceleration. I still felt like I had strong hill climb torque, but accelerating up to full speed just takes ALOT of amps. 

The top speed is just bonkers with 32T though. I have been riding for over a year, did a lot of long boarding before this, and generally love to go fast, but I just can't even push this thing to full speed, it's just too sketch. .

**EDIT:** I saw evolve was out of stock. I will probably be **selling my set** that is **very lightly used** if anyone is interested. I ride a lot in the dark, and commute alot, and these still just don't compare to pneumatics for riding on the sidewalks(de dunk de dunk de dunk). PM ME if interested.

**EDIT 2: WHEELS ARE SOLD.**

Nice post. I’ve had a couple people say the braking wasn’t bad at all. Mine haven’t shipped yet. I ordered them yesterday, hopefully evolve didn’t sell more than they have

I ran 15/40 on 107's on my 33mph Socal Performance Day build. Plenty of low end torque.

I have used 48 motor and 32 driven pulley combination. I have yet to strip my 3M belts. This works because there more than the minimum number of teeth in the groove to reduce the chance of stripping the belt. It's better to go with 5M pulleys.
