I am from New Zealand and i am having the worst time trying to get a battery from anyone over seas. Do i risk it being sent which has to miss labeled for it to be even sent and risk it being seized or do i build a 12s lipo pack with bms and display. It would cost me around $320 nzd for a lipo pack or around $480 nzd to get a 10s3p li ion pack sent. So my question is how good are lipo packs compared to li ion packs. My motor is a carvon single hub, any advice would be appreciated :slight_smile:

NOT WORTH IT! Li-ion cells are better than lipo batteries. Trust me you'll be really upset if your battery gets seized. Just build the pack, if you build your pack you can make it whatever size you want and have as much power and range you want.

i can get a hold of samsung 25r here but they are $9.95 each (around $7.20 usd) so that would be $300 for the cells (10s3p) then if i got an 10s 80a bms it would be about $120 nzd shipped and matching charger at 4a is about $120 so thats $540 and i dont have a spot welder and no case :-/ i could get a cheaper bms and charger though.

Well, that stinks, $120 seems like a lot for the charger... You technically don't need a BMS (but if you want one for safety reasons, get one. You should be able to get a charger for like $20-$30 USD it won't charge the pack as quickly but it should work. As long as the voltage is correct, go for any charger you can less than the amperage of your pack, the difference between a 2Ah and a 5Ah can be ALOT sometimes, but the trade off is that charging may be 4 hours instead of 1.5 hours. You don't NEED a spot welder, even though you should use one unless you really can't get one. You can always solder to the batteries... *cough* @whitepony *cough* QuadTheory does the same with his boosted board battery packs.

EDIT: Oh if you choose not to use a BMS, you just have to be very careful-- talk to @lowGuido

 I've read lead acid chargers are not compatible with lithium cells!!  I forget the details but I'd check it out first


Constant current or constant voltage or maybe it was something else

There is a way to get batteries in but they have to be inside the device, so i would have to buy a complete.

A fellow kiwi! Hi!

You can order LiPos from HobbyKing, just select the Australia warehouse. They ship by boat and take about 3-4 weeks to get here.

I got 2x Zippy 8000mah 4S for an 8S setup from them last week, cost was $130US including shipping.

Use lipos.  Lipo 4 lyfe.
Seriously li ion are a better battery but lipo is so cheap and easy.
You just gotta take care of them.

Hey, get some batteries from fasttech.com, they're from the US, but I ordered 10 packs of 4 18650 25R (Samsung) batteries (40 cells in total for a 10s4p). It'll cost you about $213 after conversions from USD, and maybe $230 after shipping costs. You'll have to solder them yourself and get a BMS and such other materials too, but it'll still pretty cheap compared to $480 from wherever you're getting yours from.

I got mine shipped to Australia and it took 5 days to get to me, with the cheapest shipping method which was only a few dollars.

Lipos are fine, not sure why everyone is against them so much. Just get a decent balance charger, and never over or under charge them, and they probably won't explode and burn down your house.

OT, you said you were in the middle of the north island? Where? I'm Hawkes Bay.

Normally you use 10S/12S 1P  >20C Lipos. The problem is that the VESC only have a total voltage LVC. If one cell comes unbalanced the VESC does not detect it... not everytime because the total voltage is over the LVC.
When you use 18650 you are going to use at least 3P. these three parallels will balance themself and the pack will stay  probably longer healthy .

But the main point to use 18650:
LiPo charge cycles: ~1000
LiIon charge cycles: ~1500

If you balance charge, that's no problem though, it's always balanced at the beginning. I guess potentially one cell could discharge faster or slower and might cause it or others to be discharged a little more at the end, but that seems pretty unlikely to be an actual problem.

In the quadcopter world, no one monitors indivudual cells and I've never heard of it being a problem.

Fair enough maybe on the cycles, but is that really worth the extra cost/effort?

I had the problem that one cell comes unbalanced and now it is always the first cell which reaches below 3.5V.... that is annoying because your pack has juice left but because of one cell you are fucked up... But i could be the only one who had this problem.

Another advantage is the "damage resistance"!

Well I got mine all good, I haven't tested to see if they're faulty or anything yet, but they offer a 6 month or 12 month warranty for refund or battery replacement. Pretty some someone else got it from fasttech here, not sure how they went but mine was fine.
