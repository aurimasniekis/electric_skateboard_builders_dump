Dear NYC ESK8er Riding Up 23rd and 8th Today.
So today I saw an electric skateboarder riding up 23rd St today crusin' at probably 30-40mph.
Had a sweet setup probably 90mm wheels, it was actually pretty loud and quite insane. Happened at 5:30 on Aug 15, 2016.

The board was moving pretty fast but the overall design looks pretty similar... Hmm.
Yeah NYC is the place to be!

Just did the math and that thing has a theoretical max of 38mph. Crazy stuff. Be careful going that fast with the winning remote, I've had my brakes not respond and throttle get stuck (not physically) with it. That's why I changed remotes.

Totally down for a meetup. Just set up the time and date. 

Also, please wear a full on arms and legs pads if you're going over 25 mph. Had another wipeout today because of uneven roads under Brooklyn bridge close to South St. Got abrasions on my left sides but overall ok. :weary:

What worries me about that is what if there is a board issue, or do an accidental power slide? I'd just be worried about now being able to hope right off. In a  second I don't always have time to just slide my feet out before hitting the ground. I think it would be REALLY fun though.

How do you like it? I thought about it but was told it'd be a bad idea since I can run it off if the board gets stuck in a pothole or something without straps. Kinda true, had 2 close encounter yesterday and was able to run it off buy it took a toll on my ankle though.

I really like it. It's much safer for me. I was without straps for a while but kept bailing for remote glitches and bumpy sufaces. Now I never bail. If there's a big hole I can jump over it because the board is strapped to me. U should do it.
