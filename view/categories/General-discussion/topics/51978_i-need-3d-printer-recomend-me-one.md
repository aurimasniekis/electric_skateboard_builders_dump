Hello everyone,

I need a 3D Printer. I did my study how to operate and material, bonding, etc. however I never owned one before.

I need a recommendation that is cheap and hastle free but also large enough to print an enclosure or a small furniture that I can piece it together with glue.

price of under 500. could be a bit more but...

I saw the anet8 something like that but it wables and need many mod to use it good. frankly, I dont have much time to do, these days.

Thanks in advance

Just finished a 23 hour print on my creality cr 10, pretty happy with it. Go with the CR10S Variant and buy some dampers to reduce noise, otherwise it's a really nice machine.

Or if you don't need the 30x30cmx40cm build volume you could look at the Cetus 3d printer. 300$, but i never heard of any major problems with the machine. definitely less DIY than the creality and i think the most "finished" chinese printer out there.

I'd recommend you stay clear of Anet A8, just not worth the hassle of building and troubleshooting the thing to get it working.

Original Prusa i3 for life. You can’t go wrong, I do have a CR-10 but I always use the Prusa when I need it 100%.

Prusa i3 is a very good choice, just a bit expensive. But i would definitely recommend it over the CR 10 if you can afford it!
The features of the CR10 might sound tempting (well, mainly the build volume), but you have to do some troubleshooting here and there sometimes.

The cr-10 has its problems 

The heated bed is weak, its very noisy, has no bed leveling, bed glass is warped, no filament alarm. It cant print flexible out of the box, has no boot loader out of the box so settings will reset. The sd card slot is prone to breaking. I could go on... 

If you dont like messing around and modding save up some money and get the i3 instead. If you like playing and modifying things the cr-10 is great for the price, and many of its faults are easy to fix. I believe the latest version of the cr-10 addressed some of version ones weaknesses.

Get a raspberry PI too.

I’ve got a Tevo tornado which is great. Basically the same as CR-10, just that the bed heats up waaaaay faster on the Tevo! 240V Powahh!

now that you list it like that it seems way worse than i remembered, but you are right :smile:
things i did so far:

- level bed with a bit of aluminum foil placed under the center of the glass
- switched to the microswiss 300°C hotend
- vibration dampening for the frame and the x&y motors
- raspberry with webcam mount

currently planning to switch out the fans for less noisy ones and maybe also the stepper drivers, not sure on that though.

Sometimes it's frustrating but i don't regret buying this printer yet.

I don't want so sound like i'm completely against the tevo tornado, but it's the one printer i really don't trust. So many individual components are better than the cr10, so i'm wondering where they cheaped out?
Maybe they pushed the price so much to compete with creality, i don't know. 
Maybe a cheap power supply or cheap fans? Who knows.
But if it works - all the better!

The mainboard on the earlier machines is maybe What i see as the weakest point, as the stepper drivers are noisy as hell and the salmon skin ofcourse.. But newer models have got an better board and new stepper drivers too, Who eliminates the salmon skin :smiley:

Yeah, its forgivable because it prints pretty good for the money. The stupid clips that come with it makes the most noise, the buzzy handles on them, changed them straight away. I built an enclosure and stuck it on instructables.com, that made things better, less noisy, better temp for abs 

Ive since put a negative pressure vent on it too, no chocking on dodgy abs fumes. Flashed new firmware with an arduino to allow modifying of the settings. Im going to go the whole hog and use a duet board soon. 

The good thing about the cr-10 is the frame. Its pretty sturdy. So ideal as a project printer.

The CR-10S I think improved on some of the issues you mentioned.  I dont have one myself, i've just been shopping around for a bigger printer.  I built my own DBot, so im no stranger to tweaking, so for me the CR 10 S5 with a 500x500 build plate is pretty nice (sadly the heat bed doesnt cover the whole base plate.  :\  Nothing aquanet cant fix

Fun... hmm.. i wouldnt say it was fun.  It was my first 3d printer and at the time I wanted something with a decent build volume and didnt want to drop $$ on a Prusa.  It was definitly a journey, i ran into hurdles pretty much throughout the whole process which sucked, BUT i know exactly how to tweak fix anything wrong with it.  Was it fun? Maybe afterwards once I had everything dialed in to see your creation come to life in the mechanical works but also seeing the virtual stuff you designed go from idea to tangible object is very rewarding.

Im in the beginning phases on building my first electric board and im approaching it the same way, its gonna be tough at times with fixing stupid mistakes, but in the end i'll have a very intimate knowledge of the board and can fix whatever breaks.

Coincidentally, I have a CNC, I bought a Shapeoko 3 almost a year ago and its still in the box (I moved and havent set it up...), but with the CNC i wanted to get it up and running quickly and not DIY it, so thats why I went that route.  I bought it for speed of setup and a year later, its still in the box.  Hopefully now getting into the diy boards, i'll set it up and use it for some basic parts.

Thats where im different, i enjoy designing and building things more than actually using them lol I actually quite like when things break, i like fixing stuff and improving stuff.

Id really like a mill too, then adapt it with stepper motors. I want to build things out off aluminium.

Salmon skin is a pattern that appear on the outer skin due to the use of Drv8803 or similar stepper drivers. Its a common problem on delta-type printers. Search for it on Google and you’ll understand What i mean :smile:

If you want something cheap (depending on where you are), that's not as expensive as an original prusia i3, I have been running with the Wanhao Duplicator i3 Plus for quite a while now and it prints great, is extremely reliable. 

I did the marlin firmware upgrade which comes with some cool features that the unit doesn't ship with... and printed a bunch of upgrades to it that help with reliability and print quality. It even prints flexible materials with a replacement guide tube.

Probably best to just get an original prusia i3 mk3 if you don't want to print and tinker with a bunch of your own upgrades for a cheaper printer.

We have an ultimaker 2 and 3 at work and my own Tevo Tornado feels like the better printer. I added a bed level sensor and couldn't be happier. We are at a point where my boss asks me to print things at home instead of at work on the ultimakers because my prints are better. Only reason we can't just get a Tevo Tornado there is the missing CE conformity.

You're my inverse doppelganger!  I build shit cuz I want shit.  I dont build for the sake of it, its a means to an end that im trying to accomplish.  If we want to get a tad "woo woo", your approach is the correct one, you're enjoying the process, whereas I am trying to accomplish the goal I set out to do.  Hats off to you man! (I honestly mean that)

For example, I had an idea for a website 15 years ago to solve x problem, had to learn the LAMP stack.  Then around 2008 I had an idea for an electronic project that interfaced with a computer wirelessly (I found Limors website (adafruit) and started learning about MCU's and how to use zigbee for a serial point to multipoint connection, created a protocol to deal with transmission drops).  I've always been fascinated by all the tech thats involved, but I use it to manifest the things I want. 

But i guess the differentiation is that I use my knowledge to get something done instead of just doing it for the joy of learning that thing, which if I understood you correctly is how you see it.  I could be totally off base btw, so my apologies.

I need to jump in here, cause I got the CR10-s 3 months ago. Could not be happier. All above mentioned problems are solved. Its only 480 euros on amazon.de.

I've upgraded it with auto bed level sensor (8 euro) and a 5.5MW blue laser for engravings.

But IF you have the money. Go for the Prusa i3 **MK3**. otherwise one of the CR10-s variants will do. Biggest one will do 500x500

No real benefit to discuss. I already have a 3d printer that uses 2,85 filament, and now I'm looking for one with a bigger printing volume.
Usually I buy filament in value packs so would like to use the same filament on both printers

@onepunchboard, CR-10s, was my 1st printer and i got it running in an hour. A better person could assemble it in 30 mins no problem.
I've so far used PLA and PETG and the thing just works. haven't needed to upgrade it.

I've heard that the Prusa is a solid machine and considered it instead, but the CR-10s can be had a lot cheaper, and for me, represented better value.

No not really, it depends on the print quality how fast your print is done. Imo it does not makes any differences if I print with 1.75 or 2.85 trough a 0.4 nozzle, the speed is the same.

No ofc not. But you can print with 3mm nozzle with 2.85 filament

Lol, you did not get my Point :D  First of all: You are right. It does not make any difference. How should it make a difference when the nozzle size stays the same and just the Filament size increases?

No Problem.

I would recommend a Prusa i3 MK3 if you have the Money because you will get so much more Quality than a chinese brand! EDIT: and you can print nearly anything with it (pc, pom, ...)
If you are on a Budget go with Tevo (AC-heatbed) or creality. Especially if you want to make some bigger enclosures for eboards

I was just looking at the prusas. $750 isn't bad for a piece of equipment that can prototype parts on your bench if its reliable and doesn't need a bunch of mods in my opinion.  

I need one of these.

I have the Prusa MK2s and it's great. I bought it in kit form to save £200, as well having a bit of fun builing it, and it's worked brilliantly now for over a year. For the money, the results you get from it are far superior to other printers that cost a lot more.

I have a Wanhao Duplicator 4, it's a pretty good mk8 printer with dual extrusion, picked it up for €150 with very low hrs last year, great first purchase.

I've screwed up the thermocouples by shorting them and managed to replace the thermocouple chip, diy all the way! You need to have patience and time to work with these things. Next is to make windows to fully enclose it, it's 24v so temp not an issue at all.

Lately I've been telling myself that a 2nd printer may be in order,  a backup if you like, they are really useful for building things. I was leaning towards a cr-10s but tempted by Tevo Tornado after a bit more research.

I want auto-level, glass bed, fast effective heat and plenty of update in order to pull mods/parts
