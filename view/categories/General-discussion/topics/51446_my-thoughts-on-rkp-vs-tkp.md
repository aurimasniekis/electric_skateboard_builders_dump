I found many article explains RKP with word "better geometry" therefore use on longboarding for satbility.

none of the articles I read explains what better geometry is,

But I think it comes down to trucks movement in relation the the deck.

RKP moves back and forth in order to turn
Where as TKP moves up and down in order to turn 
due to the position of Bushing, hence "Geometry".

I think this difference what makes TKP not stable since u will be more divy(up and down) which body will be hard time balancing in high speed.

Also I think RKP dampens vib more as the pivot stays angle and let bushing takes more impact.

Is this right?

I don't know what you're even saying, No offence I just don't understand
but its common knowledge RKP is more stable.

Yeah common knowledge! That's the problem, all the article just say it is more stable. and if ask why they blindly say "geomatry". which I think refers to bushing and pivot position. but they dont explain why those position makes differences. 

which is what I'm trying to figure out.

It's a decent explanation, the basics teach you about angles etc, 
The angle/degree of a RKP and TKP truck is different so the pressure on the bushings is also different.

Tkp flaps, rkp wobbles. 
.
Over powering a flap is hard unless your a pumper at heart.

Over powering a wobble can be done with a carve just lean.

For a person with out ankle control, tkp at speed is alot more violent and harder to tame. 

Both can be stable at speed, but one is harder to over powering when it starts controlling you vs you controlling it. Rkp is easier to overcome. So it is more "stable" or it's ability to be controlled in a stable manner is easier.

I would further add, when NOT at speed TKP is.more comfortable as the leans and carves are more fluid (linear) than RKP...which is why I like them.

They both have great positives. TKP vastly increases stability as width increases. Grip as well, where rkp looses grip as width increases. They're great trucks when they are made right(surfrodz).

But yeah @onepunchboard I mean the deck itself kind of flaps back and forth, remove the bushings and push the deck by itself on a tkp and it 'flaps' in mostly a straight line

 Where a rkp deck if you remove the bushings and push the deck wobbles back and forth like a slithering snake.

I rode RKP forever because everyone, and I mean everyone, said they were better. I was broke so I didn't wanna spend money in something that wouldn't perform. 

I eventually bought a pair or Surf Rodz TKPs from @psychotiller because they looked so damned cool and his mounts had the stability infiund lacking in others. I can't go back now.  I'm not saying all RKPs are better than TKPs under 20moh, but the SR TKPs are  better than any other truck I've ridden...under 20mph.

It's all in bushings seat and nose of the pivot. Surfrodz or indeez 215s are the only tkp truck I'd ever roll on..and they are amazing.most other tkp feel dead to me..(but I'm definitely an rkp guy)

Edit: talking about longboarding and speed specifically..not popsicle decks.

I feel the same.  I'll eventually get a set of the Surf Rodz RKPs just for the hell of it but I can't imagine they would be any better. 

I've got a pretty untraditional bushing setup on my Evo with SR TKPs but I'm fairly certain it was needed because bof the deck and not the trucks. But all that aside it rides awesome now and I couldn't be happier.

That's an rkp and it slithers like a snake, but good video..he actually said something good too that differentiate tkp vs rkp.

Tkp wants to go straight. Rkp wants to be in a turn..

But imagine a board that is flapping like the rkp in the video without nearly as much turn... And going straight. You have no centrifugal force pressing you down against the board in the lean..as it's going straight. so it feels violent without the "planting" effect of the centrifugal force.

I like the SR TKP the best also.. Crazy because nobody would even buy those trucks either for ESK8.

At least I don't see many people buying them. Can't beat that price at $120 for a set!

Same.  About to pull the trigger on a new set (all gold RKP's on a blackout bludgeon).  Literally just ordered the altar wedge from @psychotiller too.  Waiting on the exchange rate to dip a bit further before ordering batteries...

Back on topic.  SR RKP's with @Alphamail's bushings are SWEET.  So much better than RKP calibers. They're just fun to ride.

TKPs have a heck a lot of rake/axle offset and don't engage the busings as directly because they're not at a perpendicular angle to the angle of rotation. AKA on RKPs the kingpin is ~90 deg to the pivot axis where as TKPs its a much more shallow angle.

![blob|690x329](upload://im1A1fIEiS7cyohsdQfXKg51C6y.jpg)

Thats basically the only difference.

The better bushing engagement of the RKP means that it has a much stronger center and more progressive resistance, where as TKPs are usually described as divey.

The added axel offset means that the front has rake, essentially the opposite of caster. Forward motion of the deck makes the truck eager to enter a turn.

Edit: Pivot axis is actually not drawn correctly on the TKP, but still demonstrates the point.
![zzzz|473x446](upload://hTsKRMxt8geoNVankfTE98fvIXW.jpg)
Correct pivot axis is in blue.

There's a lot of great tkp trucks besides surfrodz guys..and the typical tkp rider doesn't use surfrodz, weird freeride guys do though..or weirdos like me...try some of the other 20 tkp trucks, tune them and pay attention to them like they were shiny and machined for a moment and you'd be surprised..

Thanks, so TKP's angle of axel is shallow and does not meet with king pin that not engaging bushing fully, and use indirect method of creating axis.Good to know

Some of my favorite tkp trucks, all worth a ride are: indy 169, ace 55 and 66, Avenue 169, surfrodz, Bennett vector 5inch, tracker axis, tracker RTS rear truck, and the Carver rear tkp as well...there's many forged options as well, and indy makes a forged baseplate with hollow titanium axle and king pin. Avenues are super fun, lightweight and pump parks faster than any truck I have used, Ace carve harder than indy, and surfrodz is different and turns more so it needs big risers or tuning like carvers...one of the classic and best riding setups is the divy and turny Bennett vector 5 inch in front and the tracker RTS on the rear..its like the tkp version of having some dont trip poppies and is a great cheap introduction to real pumping setups..![20180407_085253|689x195](upload://8fmRIhvjdTeCsyA5GpzyU93PXpa.jpg)

I dont have much experience with tkp only tkp I have is avenue 9.5". this is really bomb. I put a little throttle and can start pumping so easy. I can probably go 50km range in sigle charge with pumping. so much fun.

Someone should try making a electric pumping board with hubmotor with these. 
just a hubmotor to push abit and start pumping

but I often go 30mph+ so Im ganna change to avenue rkp. cuz current set up make me sweat when I go fast.

I also love using TKP tricks for various applications, especially when I have a short board and I want a long true wheelbase (measured from axle to axle).  Since we make bushings, we made the same shapes available for TKPs that we have for RKPs.  We call them our "StreetSeries and they come in 2 heights.  ShortStreet is .4" tall and Street is .5" tall.  ShortStreet height include a Cone and Barrel where Street height includes a Cone, Barrel, FatCone and Chubby.  TKP's can be wedged and dewedged just like RKPs with similar benefits but I normally will only dewedge the rear since most TKP's turn a lot already so I am just looking to deaden the rear a bit for higher speed stability.  The differentiating factor between TKPs and RKPs is the pivot axis is not perpendicular to the kingpin on TKPs.  For more information, have a look at:  [http://www.riptidesports.com/streetseries-bushings/](http://www.riptidesports.com/streetseries-bushings/)

Does this mean better to go with the surfrodz tkps as long as you stay under 20mph otherwise the wobbles become difficult to manage past that speed as compared to the surfrodz rkps?

woah never seen or heard of DKPs. getting weird results when Googling it lol. The double kingpin does look very unique but I've wondered how it performs in terms of carving and stability at speed which is what I'm looking for. @mmaner really like the SR TKPs for good carving experience(which I thought was generally better on TKPs) as long as you ride under 20mph.

I figured TSR KPs could be just as carvy as those with softer bushings? then maybe tighten them abit more when planning to go faster. Any thoughts on that?
```

## \#30 Posted by: mmaner Posted at: 2018-07-24T01:27:57.892Z Reads: 287

```
My rule of thumb is cruisers and carver's get TKPs, fast boards get RKPs. 

You can have a cruiser and carver with RKPs but they won't carve as hard. You can have a fast board with TKPs but it won't be as fast. 

A lot of it has to do with how you ride, how tight the king pin is, your bushing setup, etc.

Thanks for the insight! I wanted a good versatile setup that allows fun carving but wonâ€™t get me worried when going abit faster. 

Iâ€™ll probably go for rkps then get some really soft bushings to maximize the carve out of them. I hear the stock SRs are so-so so I may swap them out for something softer later on. Getting wide trucks on the 200mm rkps should help with stability as wel though I recall reading that stability on rkps decreases when the length increases? Not sure why as I figured that wider trucks should be more stable overall regardless of the truck type

I don't want to ruffle any feathers here, but Double Kingpin trucks are shit. They don't out-perform any trucks. None. Unless you are looking for trucks that over-steer and washout. Then, by all means -Do your dance

Planning second build and stuck between another set of RKP surfrodz and TKP.
I found another set of used RKP trucks, just gotta talk the guy into shipping them to me.
They are the 176mm not the 200mm. But I would think 6354s would still fit.
But I'm tempted to try the TKP trucks still.

Okay, RKP to TKP beaten to death for those that ride both. Very different riding experience on each.

But, does anyone enjoy riding RKP rear and TKP front?

I got the whim to try it tonight, SZ indeesz with adjustable baseplate on the front with surf key and softish high rebound bushings, with a dewedged TB218 on the rear with hard low rebound chubby barrels. 

It's too wet and snowy right now to test it to the limit, but I was able to ride on a small length of dry sidewalk and my initial impression is that it feels good... Almost what I'd expect an LDP setup to feel like, or a stable but hard carving machine. Too early to tell though! 

Who else, anyone else try TKP front RKP rear? Thoughts? Did you end up going back to all one or the other instead?

if your front steers more than your back, it's all good. if it's the other way around you'll have a speedwobble generator.

I set it up and the jury is still out since the weather has been garbage lately.  Coming from RKP to TKP/RKP the initial impression was meh.  Im not focused on speed and wasnt setup to try a max speed run on the first few runs.  Ill know more in the spring.

The action blink S is tkp rear and rkp front .. on a small deck 28 and stable speeds to 30-35kmh ..sweet lil sidewalk ripper. I was going to swap the front for tkp but it's been really fun so I haven't yet

I understand going RKP with low baseplate angle in the rear for stabiliry and a TKP up front for maneuverability.

But I do no get the reasoning behind TKP rear and RKP front at all.

Either did I I was very concerned by it when I bought it .. I have some nice slolom set up and trick tkp set ups.. and rkp DH ..but it just work well @Sender .. it's very fun..it won't be staying that way but I figured I'd let ppl know that Acton  blink sells them this way so it's not to life threatening..lol.. I do have the back pretty tight with some big stiff barrel and the front is super soft it can skate it pretty hard like a trick board I found great for Ollie up and down curbs and dodging people on the sidewalks

Well, its just an esperiment.  I'm not gonna mess with my setup too much or else it's all new motormounts, etc.  And it's all adjustable baseplates, so why not play around.

That said i'm probably back to TKP in the spring.

I find a single tkp drive works and rides better I think. There is less wheel torque steer with the tkp

super low angles on any RKP truck will reduce torque steer to nothing, so its a moot point. I agree TKP its easier at higher angles to do the same thing, but it's not some exclusive feature when the angles get low in the rear drive truck like they should be..

This isnt the Subsonic Spirit deck but this is the setup.   Might even use a 35 degree base plate for more stability at high speed.

Its how subsonic designed the board to be used.  Stability at high speed.  I havent made an electric Spirit yet so Im not sure what the finished product will be.   

https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=60&v=O04ISTL5550
**Spirit 30:**
Along with the Shadow single kick, the Spirit Slalom has been designed from the ground up. Featuring radial-tri-plane, the increased leverage adds to the response needed at any speed, while giving you the solid base for long straights. Designed in stages over the better half of 3 years, the Spirit is built for slalom and downhill alike, with many wheelbase options to choose.

The standing platform of the Spirit is designed to sit flat, then transitions to a micro-drop before the kick. This aids in the ability to flatfoot tuck, with added response from the leverage. The kick sits higher than most; when mounted correctly, it adds control to cornering and carving. It comes with an angled block necessary to mount the truck flat, or build to a specified degree.

*LASER-ENGRAVED Graphic!*

**Specs:**
8-ply maple construction
Length: 30" (76cm)
Width: 8 3/4" to 8 1/2" (22.2cm to 21.6cm)
Concave: &gt;1/2" Radial Tri-plane (&gt;1.3cm)
Wheelbase: 19", 19 1/2", 21 1/4", 21 3/4" (48.3cm, 49.5cm, 54cm, 55.2cm)

Interesting. Did you get to test the TKP/RKP setup any further? Any more impressions?

I currently have the Caliber II RKP trucks on a EVO Falcon deck and while it drives nicely on the road I'm missing more maneuverability when going through the city center. I'm thinking of getting TKP trucks instead but I would rather test some TKPs first before going all in for it including changing the motor mounts. Maybe changing just the front truck would be a good way of getting the feet wet?

Can anyone recommend a good TKP truck that's easily available in EU (=not Surf Rodz) and would make sense to combine with Caliber II?

Why? 

Other than psychotiller tkp i don't really know of any that have mounts available or are wide enough for motors. 


Except for maybe some of the no brand Ebay trucks.

Mounts are not needed for a front truck. Surf Rodz are difficult to get in EU. Plus, I believe they only come in pairs?

I changed it out as soon as possible. I took it out (tkp front, rkp rear) for one group ride and didn't like it. Sure, it was unique, and its worth a try if you have TKPs to test on hand, but otherwise I think it's kind of pointless. I'd recommend spending some money on a range of different formula, shape, and hardness bushings from Riptide, Venom, etc. to tune what you have or what you get to ride the way you want. 

Try it and let me know if you get the chance to do TKP/RKP, but imo, for me going RKP/RKP or TKP/TKP is best.

Evo is designed around 35degree baseplates. Caliber comes in 50 or 44.

Maybe try some dewedging risers first?
