So I'm considering building an electric cruizer and I went through a couple of beginner threads. They were extremely helpful but didn't mention any control boards or transmitters. They said the parts necessary were batteries, motors and a speed controller (as far as electronics go) but wouldn't they also need a microcontroller and a wireless receiver module for the remote? 

Thanks in advance

Pretty much all remotes come with a recevier that you connect to the vesc using servo cable. Look at any remote, it will mention it comes with a receiver

Receiver plugs right into vesc/esc (speed controller)

Connect ESC and remote with the help of a servo cable.
Ebay has the same remote, 18$ instead of 60...

That post literally lists everything necessary to build a board. If it isnt listed there, you dont need it. There is even a diagram that shows you what you need. Maybe you need to spend some more time reading if this isnt clear yet.
