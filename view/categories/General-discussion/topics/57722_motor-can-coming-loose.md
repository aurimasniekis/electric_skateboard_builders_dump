Does anyone know what I need to do to fix this movement? This board has gone through just south of 50 miles. I can tell one mount angling down more so I have to redo the loctite there..On my way home from the office just now it didn't feel right. I hopped off and noticed that the motor can is loose I can wiggle it back and forth. 

Is there something loose I need to tighten up?

probably c clip. I completely lost c clip on mine but magnets and mount just holding fine fo me.

Make sure the c clip is on correctly, and if it is, the set screws in the back are loose. 

This is a common issue with these motor in the 6374 size. That‚Äôs why I have moved away from them. More times than not, it‚Äôs the set screws.

@jlabs what set screw are you taking about? Is it that one hex I see inside those vent slots

The motor shaft definitely shifted.

That looks like the set screw at the back that keeps the can and the shaft. check if thats loose

Yep that‚Äôs it. The way they have them installed, it‚Äôs practically impossible to fix. I literally tried everything to fix them..

Happened to me with a similar (the same?) motor. 

Couldn't untighten the set screw though, not even with added heat, and eventually it stripped. I had to use a hammer to push the shaft out and then added green loctite to keep shaft in place.

Dremel a flat spot with a cutoff wheel. The reassemble and put the setscrew on the flat spot

Same exact problem for me in the past! If you strip the grubs you'll have to drill them out. That motor can accommodate up to an m6 grub. To set the shaft to the right depth, you can set the can on a skate wheel, put the spacer and the circlip back on, and _gently_ hammer the shaft back until it won't go further.
If you have to drill, remove the shaft, and use duct tape to cover the motor magnets.

There is a flat spot on the shaft already, but it's too long allowing the screw to slide along the flat spot. They should have drilled a hole for the set screw, not a flat spot.

Hope I can fix this soon. Thanks everyone!

So in theory, the shaft can‚Äôt just fly out it the grub screw is not back all the way out?

I‚Äôll try to take it out, clean and apply blue loctite

It sits pretty tight even without the screw, and then add the force of the magnets... It won't fly off, although it might not run very smooth as there will be some added strain on the bearings? 

I noticed that when getting the shaft in place, motor ran a lot smoother with less noise.

It‚Äôs a very tedious process.. you will for sure have to drill out the set screws because they are so small and brittle. Also, if you push the shaft back in at the slightest angle you will ruin the entire can.

Dude one of my motor is doing exactly the samething. My motor can slides like yours and also the shaft rod shift too. I really hope you can find a way to fix yours

Ok, I got a chance to pull the two set screw out, pressed the shaft back to the correct position, re-tightened the set screws with a make shift torque wrench.

Sadly the can (with shaft) is still moving make and forth. I was only able to pull the motor off so much to peek in without taking off the mount. It does look like the circlip is warped/bent. Does anyone know what size circlip that would be in that thicker park of the shaft? I want it on hand before taking more things apart.

I had the same problem with the motor of my first build. My solution was to add washers between circlip and pulley then the can with shaft can't move outwards anymore. Second advantage is that you can re-mount the pulley 100 times and it's always on the same position as before.

I use washers on all motors to prevent this.

I think you could write to them showing the problem and asking for a replacement can. Safest option!

I think these motors have a single washer before the circlip?

You got any pics?

I had the problem with a APS motor (which also had a single washer between circlip and bearing), the groove for the circlip was too big that's why the can and shaft could move outwards like 0.5-1mm. First I pushed the can in the inside position then added washers and pushed the pulley against it when mounting, no more play.

This is how my actual motors for MTB look like, the first 1-2 washers should be small skate shim spacers (8 or 10mm), the remaining washers can be any kind of washer (depending on motor mount).

That should be a (DIN 471 external circlip) 10mm

Scary. I don't know how any of you can build a fast board with the Spud. After riding to the office with the long and wide Hummie build, the Spud felt so tiny.

The Landwheel isn't bad but the hub urethane is starting to chunk.

Mine actually goes only 40km and I feel stable with it. Of coourse longer board are more stable.

...Maytech has a little nipple at the end of motor where you have access to the Grub screw

..Sk3 have 2 grub screws at the end.

Hey bro. I fixed my loose can issue, it was the c-clip that came loose on the motor shaft. Don't know if this was your issue with your loose motor but figured I can share üòÅ

My circlip was fine. I added a washer behind it and it stopped the movement. BUT because the washer has a large outer diameter it pushed up against the mount. I‚Äôm waiting for a proper 10mm washer that would fit and should solve the issue

Well after ‚Äúfixing‚Äù it twice by applying new loctite and torquing down the grub/set screw, it looks like I‚Äôll have to take the (learn to) motor apart and dremel the shaft?

I was going to check out the trail today and noticed the shaft move out at mile 4, so I decided to turn back around. Thought I was gonna eat it. 

@JLabs this answers your question üòí when are those motors coming it!?

@scepterr any assistance from you since you got these? I would love to get a replacement from the manufacturer becuase this is defective! Rather not open it up.

maybe you could try using 638 loctite. That and boring through the hardened axle fixed mine...

@Mikenopolis I have the same motors ( from a different vendor) and my shafts keep slipping too. No amount of lock tight seems to fix it. Imo the grub screws that are used are too small to tighten down sufficiently. I ended up knocking the shaft out, re drilling and tapping the grub screws to a larger size then re fitting the shaft.

Also one of my motors seems to have developed bad vibration at one particular frequency, I'm sure it's a balance issue with the motor bell. I would love to know where I could by a replacement shaft and bell.

I‚Äôm think of pulling out the shaft and drilling a dimple on the shaft so the grub screw has something to hold on to. What I‚Äôm afraid of is the grub screw being bent...well I guess that really locks it up then. 

I have no idea where to get replacement cans and shaft. I assume you have to figure out the Chinese manufacturer and ask them directly. I actually ordered two other motors so I‚Äôll probably swap them so I won‚Äôt have down time while figuring out the repair

the grub screws are just to small to get tight enough without rounding the hex's. I put 4mm grub screws back in and it seems solid. After reading this thread i just checked my other motor and noticed that started slipping to. guess its going to get the same treatment soon.

I had the same problem motor replaced and problem is gone tho I‚Äôm facing a different problem now. Can is moving up and down slightly and it makes a clicking noise when running. When I accelerate clicking sound vanishes but still not comfortable with that Can moving up and down. And it only moves on the specific spot of the can. This makes me wonder if it is grub screw problem.. any suggestions?
