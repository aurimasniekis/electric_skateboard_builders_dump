So looking for some softer wheels. I hear abec 11s are the way to go. Having a hard time finding some outside over evolves site (high shipping) and curious if I should get a large wheel than 83mm?

Mainly looking for the smoothest ride possible. This is on a raptor.

I have abec11 flywheels in 90m 75a and 83mm 75a
The 83s look better and seem more responsive when carving. 
As far as smoothness, I don't remenber a huge difference.

I highly reccomend 75a and I use 83mm. I can't even find any online in the US right now, though. Does anyone have any insight on what looks to be a shortage of flywheels?

I don't think abec 11 have been producing them for a while, or at least to nowhere near the quantity that they need to be. Stoked skateboards are trying to get some in soon. I got 78a 83mm wheels from there. I was personally not that impressed by the 78a utathane, I'd go with 75 if possible.

smothest ride possible is flywheels in 75a, 90mm is a good size

Abec 11s homepage lists they only make 78a in 90mm. If anyone can pm me a source for 83 or 97 mm in 75a I'd much appreciate it. So how are the clones? I know not all urethane is the same and I always rode abec 11 before Eboarding

Most clones are 78a+ but I've some 75a clones on order from the group buy, I'll going to test how the clones urethan rides

Any update on your wheels?  I'm hunting down still.  Debating on larger wheels (90 or 97 mm even). The ride is just so scary over the bumps.  I feel like I have to be doing 15mph+ to feel like it'll survive a big bump or crack and that is just such a commitment.  My helmet showed up so I feel a bit safer but still...
