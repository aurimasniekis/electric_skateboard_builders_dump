Okay so my battery should be coming in the next week or so. I went to price an enclosure, which i was getting from eskating.eu but with shipping it is going to cost me $190AU which is honestly just crazy. Does anyone have any idea of where i could buy an enclosure that will fit a dual stack 12S5P without completely destroying my wallet?

Donâ€™t know which board you have, but have a look here
https://www.eboardsperu.com/
If you need something special get in contact with
@Eboosted. His enclosures are high end ðŸ˜‰

You can always try to make your own out of fiberglass. 
Or get some plastic boxes and mount them
Or get a waterproof box and mount it on top in case you have a mtb

Im getting a double stacked 10s6p and can fit it in the shuksan arm from psychotiller but Iâ€™m using thick rubber as a riser. This one should fit without modification and is $91 aud before shipping which from memory wasnâ€™t much at all.

bro to be honest, I'm in Australia too and there's like no hope of getting a cheap good enclosure. You're better off heading to bunnings, buying some protite fibreglass resin and catalyst and some matting off hobbyking and building your own enclosure. It's what I did and really is not that hard

Honestly dude, I'm fucking terrible at anything DIY so I don't trust myself to build something that houses over a thousand dollars worth of stuff. Probably just gonna have to suck it up and pay the high price

If they fit... my enclosures are Â£45 and I think I can get shipping for around Â£17?

I'm gonna wait until I get the battery so I can get exact dimensions, then I'll get to you on that! Loving the look of the stuff on your insta, especially as you have an enclosure made for a landyachtz which I plan on moving up to in the future

another option, design a 3d model in onshape, save the stl and get it printed on 3dhubs. They print local. Where are you based?

Geelong, I'd prefer the option that requires as little work from me as possible as I've already sunk way too much time and money into this and haven't gotten very far, but I do like the idea of being to shape the enclosure exactly  how I'd like

Edit: Not sure whether people in Australia even realise Geelong exists I'm better off saying Melbourne ahahha

exactly. There's heaps of cad programs so take your pick. Simply design one to measurements snd get it printed

I know its been a few months but did you ever find a decent priced enclosure? I have been looking for one and in the process of 3d printing one out of petg. I really like the design of it but having a hard time getting prints to not warp(petg). the design has a high tolerance, so they have to print perfect to fit. here is the thingiverse link : https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3230058
https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3233819
    
       I want to have a flat battery made of 18650 cells.  It's slim pickings for a enclosure for such a large flat battery. I may end up trying to design my own in fusion 360. I just don't want to keep waiting lol I want to ride it lol!

Ended up buying from eskating.eu in the end. Gonna be moving up to dual FSESC6.6 soon which wont fit side by side in this enclosure (I think)

nice! I just ordered the flipsky vesc 6.6! hope its good! there is a couple enclosures on phychotiller site for $60 USD that will hold a flat 12s5p pack and the duel vesc 6.6. so if my printed model doesnt turn out I'll be getting that for sure.
