I'm just starting to use these mbs matrix trucks but it seems no matter how hard i lean it only goes straight.  Is it the egg bushings that stop that?

Even if you removed the bushing and springs you can't turn if the trucks are mounted level.

Do you have them mounted to a flat deck?

Look at the truck design haha if you hold it flat, there is no way for it to turn

The board will just tilt in place

Never said i was smart lolz.  Normal trucks don't needto be at an angle. Didn't study these enough i suppose

I had my matrix 2 trucks on a 20° tipped deck and just switched to a 30° tip deck yesterday and the turning is a world of difference. You will be much happier with the new deck!

Street trucks are already at an angle, typically 50 degrees.  Mountain Board trucks are at 0 degrees because most mountain board decks are 20-35 degrees at the truck mounting position, which put the trucks at whatever angle the deck is.  

Look at Kaly or Colab decks if you want some epic.

I've been following that project but told myself I'd never get burned on a crowd fund again :cry:

Looks like a sweet deck. Interesting if they actually get boards out in August...

I like the colab a lot. Was a bit too pricey for me though. Let me know your thoughts on it in the good place

My super shallow first take

* Looks trampa holypro > dwii > colab
* Comfort colab > dwii > holypro
* Steer-ability colab > dwii > holypro
* Cost dwii > holypro > colab

If I wasn’t addicted to emtb like crack and just wanted a daily rider I will have no hesitation in pointing you to dwii. @MBS nailed the right balance between quality and price.  Even though from a performance perspective the first impression I got from colab is better it’s almost 3x the price and rare. Unless you are chasing the best of the best I would stick to mbs.

So I get speed wobble but I still can't really see as tight as I want.  I have the orange eggs in it currently and the springs as loose as they can go. Would tightening the springs and getting the softer eggs take care of the wobble but atleast not reduced what turning radius I have?

Couples of things to consider.  Good luck

* You might be getting used to the setup.  If you haven't ridden mountainboard before try finding a safe spot to practice really tilting.

* The springs and eggs loosen up over time.  You kinda need to "break them in"

* Try a loose front tight back setup since wobble tend to come from the back as oppose to the front.

* Springs tend to be more unstable by nature.  Hence Lacroix and the new MBS trucks are all based on thane blocks instead of springs.  May be worth looking into if you are having trouble dialing them in.
