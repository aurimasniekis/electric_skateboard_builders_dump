Now that most of you have received your new Shredlights....

What features do you wanna see next? How could they make them better?

Post below with your two cents....

GO! Go! GO!

I bought a set for one of my (human-powered) skateboards

These are really convenient and easy to install.  But when you think about, they don't really make sense for an electric board.  You are literally riding on top of a giant battery, and now you've just added 2 (or 4) more batteries.  So you've got to charge 3-5 batteries, instead of one.  Replace the individual batteries with a voltage regulator, and then add a convenient method of wiring them (like inline XT-90 connectors)

WHAT!!!! I hope you're talking about a board with tiny human inside each wheel... or it doesn't make sense. :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

I think it might be cool if they made a super tiny remote switch that was adhesive and could attach to your eskate remote to turn them on and off remotely. That way you wouldn't have to mess with doing it through your existing receiver or anything like that.

Integrate into deck build more, use esk8 battery, tie into RF remote, turn signals, brake lights when you brake, RF bright/dimmers, etc. 

And of course tie into @Michaelinvegas LED vanity light strips!!!

An esk8-specific model with integrated ubec so they can be connected directly to an esk8 battery; they can reduce the size by removing the stand-alone battery and there'd be no need to recharge.

## \#19 Posted by: ACIN Posted at: 2017-01-26T20:52:55.589Z Reads: 157

What I mainly want is braking lights (rear light flashing brighter when braking).
I also would love to be able to control the light with my remote that is connected to my master VESC.

To sum it up give me the freedom to program what I want the lights to do when.
Let me run the lights on the esk8 battery, not on small ones you have to change.

Lastly, bring other models out! LED Strips (with programmable colors and functions) for underboard lighting, indicators and other lights for different uses!

I know that is a lot to ask for but I think that DIY Esk8 builders have their reason why they don't just buy boards that are ready to ride but build their own creations, even if they may have to pay just as much for it in the end: They want to make it unique and **their** board.
Just look at the success of the VESC if you doubt such a DIY-friendly product would be unsuccessful.

Possibly brighter,  and lights on both ends so it creates an under glow effect. For those who are into that.

I don't really think the market is big enough for eSk8. Yes we did a nice sized group buy, but there will be a lot of money tied up into development of what you guys are suggesting. Don't get me wrong they are cool ideas, I just don't think it's practical. 

Features I would like:

1. A little brighter, while they do light up a decent are, who dosnt mind more light?
 
2. Flash mode. I think it would be useful for alerting people/drivers behind you. This should be fairly easy to implement.

Everything else listed above I would love to see, and if you guys pull it off you have my full support.

The lights really feel professional. And the fact that they didn't give up after their Kickstarter Campaign was unsuccessful almost made me want to buy the lights a full price. And to top it all off, a hand written note on the order. Good luck in your future endeavors ShredLights!

Got my Shredlights in today! Quality is great. Only changes/additions I would add would be: Right angle bracket so you can mount in a larger variety of places, and make the red more red. I bent my bracket so I could under mount it on my drop-thru. Works perfect!!!

Thanks!

I haven't got any yet but only thing I would maybe like to see is different brackets. Like I have a flat longboard but I also have a drop through with kick tails which would mean the light would point in the air. So if you had either multiple mounts or one adjustable one. Oviously brighter the better would maybe a projector style light with a beam designed better to work that close to the ground.

Would like a way to wire them in directly.  4 things to charge on top of the board is a bit much.  Other than that, I second the "more red".  They do hold well though onto their brackets. I was pleasantly surprised.

if it hasnt been suggested already...
how about some ambient light sensor system so they turn on automatically at night or in low light? 
tied with the board's power of course, so they only turn on when the board itself is on

so if there was one thing that I don't like about the shredlights. Just one thing I could change.
it would be this:

the USB port for charging is entirely obscured when mounted. not a big deal for regular users, but for e-skate we have batteries and the potential for a simple USB buck converter to power them off your main battery. however this cannot work because of the charge port location on the shredlights.

this obviously opens a can of worms about dust getting in the USB and such.. but we are inovators.. we would work something out.

another thing someone might be able to tell me, the green light on the top does that serve as some sort of battery indicator? or is it just power on and charge light? I noticed its red when charging and green when powered on, but it there any sort of battery level indication? does it flash? battery level would be nice.

I didn't read the whole thread to see if someone has said this already but I'd like the usb port to be accessible without taking the light off. The to that are by my motors (dual diagonal) are a bit more difficult to remove and I'd rather just plug them into my boards to usb charging ports to charge while my board is charging.

Here ya go...
Not too difficult, fold the front over, push a little from the back, then pull the inside out. One thing that is not so good is when you separate the the two plastic halves they're glued together at 2 plastic pins. I broke them but you can re-glue it. Should be able to solder into the power and the switch.

I just did [teardown of a shred light](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/shred-light-teardown-and-internal-review/29725) and went over the internal as well pretty much just figuring out how it all works. Anyways pretty much the LED Driver IC in there has a max of 6V so don't go above that, though the LiPo charger IC could have problems if you go above 4.2V. I'd recommend just using a buck converter and turning it down to 4.2 or 4V to be safe. And current draw maxes out at about 180mA so make sure your source can provide that. Then just poke a hole in the rubber sleeve and run your power wires out of that, though that could affect the water proofing of it.

For starters, besides having to charge my Evolve Bamboo GTR AT, I have 6 ShredLights on my board. 2 on the rear and 4 up front with 2 each underneath and on top of my deck so 7 batteries to charge!

Just charging the new generation for the first time after having Gusto from Filipacchi in NYC on Prince Street and 1 wonâ€™t turn green after charging. I reversed the plug in the socket which DOES make a difference but still no green on 1 of the on top headlights. It will turn on as white and go through all modes but wouldnâ€™t turn green from charging but stays off. Iâ€™ve emailed the company but havenâ€™t heard back.

Iâ€™d like to see a way to make the beams wider or be able to point the beams slightly up so more illumination spreads out over board versus parallel the ground. The lenses also should have a larger circumference.
