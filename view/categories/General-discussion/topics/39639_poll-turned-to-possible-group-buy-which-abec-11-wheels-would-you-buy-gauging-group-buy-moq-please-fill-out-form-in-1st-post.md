Considering all the interested in ABEC11 wheels, this thread has now been turned in to a possible group buy. 

As can be seen further down in this thread, @ChrisChaput from ABEC11 has let us know that the MOQ (minimum order quantity) for abec11 wheels are 75 sets (75x4= 300 wheels). He also told us that this MOQ is for a given size, with a given hardness formula. So sizes cannot be combined to reach 75 set. For example: 
- 75 sets of 107 mm wheels 74 A hardness - YES!
- 75 sets of 97 mm wheels 74 A hardness - YES!
- 50 sets of 107 mm wheels plus 15 sets of 97 mm = 75 sets - NO!

@thisguyhere has created a form for everyone to fill out in order to gauge the viability of this group buy and see if the MOQ can be obtained. Firstly we will determine if we can reach 75 sets of a given size and then discuss urethane hardness. More so, since the ABEC11 site is temporarily down, I don't know all the hardness combinations for each wheel size and prefer not to guess. 

Please fill out the form bellow with your user name, size and quantities of wheels that you desire. 

https://goo.gl/forms/cRsR56D6sFGO36Aj1

Laddies and gentlemen, lets make this happen!

[spoiler]I believe many people underestimate the power of our esk8 community and perhaps do not grasp the dimension and potential market that exist within this community. 

From the small time i have been here, i have read over and over that ABEC 11 wheels are the most sought after wheels due to their quality. I have also discovered that they are almost impossible to buy anywhere. 

I've asked Mr. @ChrisChaput if he would be willing to do a group buy directly to the community but did not get a response. Perhaps if we could show him our size he would reconsider this request and that way everyone would be able to get a few sets of wheels. 

 

**

## Which ABEC 11 Flywheels would you buy if given the opportunity?

**

[poll name=WhichAbec11WheelsWouldYouBuyIfGivenTheOpportunity?]
 - 76 mm 
 - 83 mm 
 - 90mm 
 - 97 mm
 - 107 mm
[/poll]

**

## Which urethane hardness would you choose?

**

[poll name=WhichHardnessWouldYouChoose?]
 - 74 A
 - 75 A
 - 77 A 
 - 78 A
[/poll]

**

## How many sets of wheels would you consider buying?

**

[poll name=HowManySetsWouldYouBuy?]
 - 1
 - 2
 - 3 
 - More than 3 sets
[/poll]

I have no relation with the poeple of ABEC 11 neither do i know how to get in touch with them (especially now with their website being down). I'm just a new ek8 builder that likes to use good components parts in everything i build. 

If you have any suggestions on how to improve this poll please let me know. 

Thanks a lot for participating.[/spoiler]

I forgot to consider the option that users might want to buy several sizes and forgot to add multiple choice to the wheels size option and thane hardness. I have tried to change this however due to forum rules it can only be done by a forum moderator. I am currently waiting for this change to be done to ensure a more accurate representation.

Yeah...i Pm'ed @longhairedboy and @lowGuido asking if they could change the poll settings. I also forgot to ask them if they could make the votes public. Would give more credibility to the results if there are names backing up the choices.

This is the first time i've made a poll so sorry for not getting all the parameters right! Live and learn!

They disregard the forum saying we are minuscle.... but on the other hand they inmediately step on to the bandwagon adopting our findings or our trendy fashions when they see bucks in the horizon.... a.k.a. ABEC 11 jumping on bed like a forgoten Cougar to start an affair with Evolve, or Trampa predating VESC open source to their own $$ advantage.

Just consider a group buy order of 100 sets of wheels. Which is small considering the size of the forum.

100 sets at around 100$ a set equates to a 10000$ order. And i bet most of us would put the money up front. A 10000$ order with cash up front with a relaxed delivery date. Whats not the like about that?

sorry, just now seeing this. Is the poll behaving?

Also i think everyone should chip in and pay $10,000 for the single shrink wrapped set of superflys that i have right now. I think that's a reasonable price for one set of wheels considering the current climate.

No problem. What do you mean by behaving? 

I created this poll in an effort to translate in to numbers the desire of abec11 wheels that forum members would like to buy. I would then like to show these numbers to Abec 11 in an effort to promote a direct deal with them and (if the are going through a rough patch as said on another thread) perhaps motivate them to keep pushing through.

That is the last thing i want to do! I want them to stay in business and provide quality wheels to us. I oppose all trash talk and if the thread goes in that direction i will ask for it to be shut it down and closed. 

My objective is to try to quantify how much esk8 would like them to stay in business and how much they could sell by working directly with the forum.

[/quote]

However much we would like them to stay in business, i'm fairly certain Chris would like to stay in business more. Whatever is happening over there isn't going to be saved by a group buy, however i do think its important that we show our support and this group buy is a good way of doing that. 

I never got the sense that they thought the forum was miniscule. Chris is a very communit oriented guy. He loves sharing, almost to the point of annoying. Whatever is going on over there, its probably either not good or a symptom of something better coming that we don't know about. But it certainly has nothing to do with a lack of demand or support.

Money has been a challenge for many US companies in the longboard / skateboard market and that as been true for Abec 11 too. If people can cobble together an order for enough wheels for us to make our MOQ (minimum order quanitity), I'd be happy to put the order in. The order needs to be for 300 wheels (75 sets of 4 of one size, one color, in one urethane, in one duro. That's what comprises a SKU.

Examples:

1.  A quantity of 500 97mm Flywheels (Green wheels with Orange cores) in 75a Classic urethane.

2.. A quantity of 300 107mm SuperFly's (Black wheels with Green cores) in 74a Reflex urethane.

p.s. I'm not on here checking PMs often so abec11 (at) gmail (dot) com works for me

Thanks you @ChrisChaput for your kind reply. It is good to hear from you and i hope (and i guess almost everyone on this forum) that you and company are well. 

I believe that MOQ can be reached as the interest on the forum is large, as well as several small business owners would probably also like to tag along. 

Hopefully you will hear from us soon with an order.

this doesn't make me feel better. If the MOQ for the factory is only 75 sets, there shouldn't be a drought right now. The demand for these things far outstrips what a group buy could offer. 

Nothing about this makes me feel good.

So the poles are showing that 107 mm and 97 mm are the most desired as well as 74 A and 75 A shore hardness. 

Color and graphics will probably be tweaked to our taste (to some extent of course) if desired (i'm fine with wacky retro green). 

I'm gonna let the poll run a bit longer to get the feel of community? What do you guys think is the best course of action?

Yes i see your point. 75 sets does't amount to much in terms of investment for a medium sized company. So why aren't more people placing orders like Evolve did? This is a very good question! 

I believe this type of product still remains a niche product. The DIY community doesn't mind dropping 100$ + on a set of wheels. But how do you educate the general public to buy your wheel instead of the 25$ clones on ebay?

Id recommend the green for whatever group buy option we choose. Thats Chris's original foumla with all the RD. All the other colors are slight tweaks and from what Ive seen and heard chunk easier. Ive seen and heard of many more chunked, pink, red and black wheels than I have Green.

I think one of us will have to do that. For evolve it makes sense to buy in large sets not so much for us or any other regular skateboarding company. I think our best bet is to include resellers like @longhairedboy and @psychotiller maybe they can get 5-10 sets each and the rest of us putting in our orders to do a massive groupbuy to reach 75 sets. Evolve is just milking those 107's for 160 right now.

What would be the pricing for 75 sets of the original 107's or 125 sets of the 97's?

My preference is the 107's as.... I like big wheels and I cannot lie.

That's really not a fair statement where abec is concerned!  Chris has been making Flywheels long before most of you knew what a longboard was...

I sense the frustration. But take a second and breathe. He was riding electric boards before all of you as well. 

He was also here on the forum to promote the use of quality components rather than chinese knockoff shit. He was quickly muted even though everything he said was going to happen DID. But who is this community of cheap asses really in support of?

What's happening now is a prime example of what happens when you don't support  local companies. 

Sorry for the rant, but this is the 5th shitty comment I've seen concerning Abec11 today and it's too close to home.

I'll then handover owner rights to @Ronny_CTS

MOQ of 75 sets should be attainable no problem.

@ChrisChaput is that moq for one size, or can we cobble together a collection of sizes to get to 75 sets?

I think we should wait until ABEC11 ships all their current orders, like for example, to sk8kings and to esk8 manufacturers, and THEN, AFTER THAT, we should definitely group buy.  But only after they ship *something, damnit* so we know they haven't turned into a scam operation.

@treenutter i totally agree with forum rules and will not be handling the money aspect of possible group buy. I just took initiative to get the ball rolling in that direction. 

For now this is just an assessment thread to determine if MOQ can be met. Which I believe so based on the poll the ran initially and showed 84 votes of which 53% where for the 107 mm wheel. That equates into almost 45 sets (if each person would only buy one). Bearing in mind that people will probably buy more than one set, i think MOQ is attainable.

a re-run of the old electric flywheels would be bad-ass... like regular 107's but wider so you have more grip, I don't think we had the power when they where released to make use of them, but now we do! if it turns out to be regular width 107's in classic 75a with black cores I'm in. But the next level would be the original release _"electric flywheels"_ with the extra width for more grip!

Ok but it shouldn't be that vicinity... that's a pair right? We are talking here 75 pairs - a pair being 4 ;)

We should get them maybe for $80-90 + shipping is what I am wishfully hoping for.

EDIT: Please negotiate for a good price. I can only share some anecdotes about this. I previously tried to inquire about becoming a vendor for esk8 products (which I have decided not to in the end as it's not very good margins) but Maytech was willing to sell me 100 x 6374 170kV sensored motors in the $70 shipped range.  They retail those between $120 - $150. So we should get a good price... a wholesale price.

Muirskate had the 97's for 90.06 and the 107's at a sale price of 123.21 with shipping at one point so a full run order should be a good amount less.  I would be more incline for the 90mm but that is just me.  I would think the reflex thane would be more expensive then the classic so that would be something to think about as well.

I think 120 was like a special friendship deal already. We'll see. Chris said producing the wheel moulds for a wheel cost around $10k so I don't think an order of 75 pairs will be that big of a deal for him.

btw can we puhlease keep the original colors and just print a forum branding on them? I really like the oldschool green/orange design.

I think that maybe Evolve ordered more but for a skateshop it's not that small. We are talking about one specyfic wheel here and there are so many of them. So the proces requires to order molds for every batch? 
I think the molds are there. I also belive and hope that we should get a price around what @gogomrrobot said but how can we achive that when some of us openly giving 120$ range :(

If we really want to support ABEC 11 and @ChrisChaput , I think we should just get standard-colored wheels and cores.  This helps Chris out by allowing him to add on top of the MOQ for that run from the manufacturer.  The more we specialize these wheels the less profitable they become and the less likely they will be produced.

yea thats what i paid for a set laying around the shop, maybe a prototype or something. unbranded.

my take is it's hard enough to get and keep chris' attention so the less we ask of of him the better. 

I also like the idea of esk8 branding but that'll just add to the lead time, maybe even drive up the cost.

Yeah, looks like it. I can understand how it might get unnoticed. Maybe you should start a new thread with 107mm group buy, since that's the only one that looks achievable, linking the same google doc. Or its possible some of them did want to buy but may not be certain without knowing all the details like price etc. Once we get the price we can possibly start another thread by you.

I'm in on the 107's.
My first preference would be to get Chris to do a run of the "Electric Flywheels", these came with black cores and where a bit wider than regular 107 flywheels. This could be the only way we could get our hands on these wheels as no body is stocking them.
My second choice is to get the classic formula 75a green 107's with black cores...
I know a few other members are aligned in my thinking, and some don't care. Could we possibly poll this?

I am not sold on "Electric Flywheels". The reason they are not being stocked by anyone and weren't used by anyone was because they were too big to be used with dual motor setups. My vote is for Superflys with black or red core with 74a .

## \#76 Posted by: Cobber Posted at: 2017-12-01T02:07:47.668Z Reads: 124

```
the 74a has been known to chunk more than the 75a classic formula, those with experience with flywheels have mentioned this earlier in the thread... so for that reason I would vote for the 75a...
When the wheels first came out people where using smaller motors and not riding as fast as now. Personally I want the grip that comes with the width and would be all over a opportunity to get some electric flywheels..
I'm sure not everyone will agree, hence I suggested we poll the variables.

75a seems like a reasonable choice if what you say is true but then again I do want the high reflex pu even if it is slightly less durable. And abec never produced 107mm wheels with classic formula, we would need to confirm if they can even do it, might even cause delays. A poll seems like a reasonable choice to decide what to do once we have enough people but If I were to take a guess I would say almost all of people in this group buy would be using these with dual rear motors, which means we can't get the older electric flywheels.

I accidentally bought a set of slightly used Electric Flywheels only realising later that there are different kinds of ABEC11 107mm wheels. Now I can not fit 15mm belts, can not find fitting pulleys, am forced to use Torqueboards 218 Trucks etc.

I would definitely go for the new sideset flywheel in a group buy.

Based on the results of the initial poll of this thread I fired an email at @ChrisChaput yesterday asking for ballpark figures and delivery times for:
-	MOQ (75 sets): 107 mm 74a reflex formula
-	MOQ (75 sets): 97 mm (hardness to be defined)
-	MOQ (75 sets): 90 mm (hardness to be defined)

This is just an initial approach and therefore if this group buy evolves all the details such as urethane formula, core type and core color will be decided by all of us based on the experience and opinion of other ABEC11 wheel users. 

I just wanted to get an ideia of what we will be dealing with in terms of time and cost, which will make the group buy much more noticeable to other members of the forum.

On another note, abec11's website is back online!I

Given the fact that @chaka was clearing the 97mm stock at 78$/set (which should be pretty close to  "wholesale price") and considering that the 107mm are 1.4 times more expensive, a fair price would be 110$/set.
Then considering we are buying more than a normal shop, the price could be discounted further.

IMO placing an initial order of 300 units would make this forum a decent resale account opportunity for any manufacturer.  But pretending that resellers only make $10 on a set of $150 wheels is a bit crazy.  Resellers of specialized products don't typically operate on 7% margins.   

I'm sure that many vendors on this forum would argue that they work on lower margins. But none of them is the size of Evolve.  Nor are they ordering the MOQ from ABEC 11 alone.

Better pricing has been the goal in all the group buys that I have seen.  We aren't looking to pay retail (or close to it) for batteries, motors or any other component when buying in quantity.  I doubt any reseller would.
If I was going to pay $140 for 107's, I would just buy them from Evolve for $10 more and get product immediately and without the hassle.  (I already did this for my fist set of 107's)

Chis can charge whatever he wants, but please let HIM come up with a price for us.  He knows his business and what he thinks is a fair deal for 300+ units.  He has the opportunity to sell more, because we will buy more wheels if they come in at a lower price.  I don't need 3 sets of 107's, but I will buy them for the right price.  And I doubt that I'm the only one.

Right, I highly doubt evolve is buying those wheels for $140 per set, my guess is $80-$100 and they are selling for double. We might be waiting for a while to get the price since its so difficult to get a reply from chris if we get a good price I would definitely get 2 sets as well.

I dont believe a group buy will happen, because A) chris isn't responding right now, B) All of the shops are starting to get stock of the wheels

Theres a few places to find them rn.

Yep...i don't see this happening any time soon as different shops have the wheels in stock. I assume ABEC11 had to prioritize his orders and left us on the side margins. Which is understandable considering he must keep good relations with his main clients (skate shops and retailers). 

However, i'm gonna let the dust settle a little and try again in a near future. Keep you posted if something comes up.

So, if I knock on your door and you don't answer...I should take it as disrespectful? While you might be on the other side having a family dinner and thinking me disrespectful for knocking? Maybe people just have shit to do...give them a break dude like you yourself would wish to be treated...

The guy who knows everything best...... It's a difference in time don't you think when you knocks with no anwser and someone doesn't anwser for weeks. Maybe he has a reason, maybe.... but for now it's how I feel. I wrote a bit just tinny bit because it's no big deal but for me it would be better to hear "oh silly kids I can't do that because that's not how this business works" and I would be ok even if I'm called 36 years old kid ;)
