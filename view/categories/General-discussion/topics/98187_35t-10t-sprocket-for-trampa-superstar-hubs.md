Hello im wondering if there are alternative sites to get some 10T/35T sprockets from that fit the trampa Super star hubs and an 8mm shaft with keyway.

I have tried https://www.overion.fr/ but im having a hard time contacting the owner about shipping to AU as the site doesnt support it.

there is no workshop around which could drill you the stock sproket out to your needs?
itÂ´s just the center part and 5 holes to drill.

live in the heart of the CBD in Adelaide, i cant say for sure as i moved here about 2 months ago and dont have a vehicle. pretty much live in the business district where there is nothing but takeouts and barber shops >.<


Thinking i might design something in Fusion 360 and see what it would cost to get it CNC'd

Yann @overion will help you out when he is able to get the time. He set me up with a chain system and spare nuts and bolts all the way in the usa. Just send him an email at yannlebrigand@gmail.com and he should get back to you in a few days or so.

Or you could try etoxx or unik. I'm in the same boat with wanting certain sprockets but no drill press to get the holes right.
