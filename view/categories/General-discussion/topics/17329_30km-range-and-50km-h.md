Hi guys,

This video popped up in my youtube feed where somebody presents his DIY esk8 and claims a top speed of 50km/h and 30km range. These are the parts he used:

> 50 km/h 
> 1000 w brushless motor
> esc 120 a
> battery lithium 6s 22.2v 10000 mah
> electric brake
> 30 km range

> moteur: Turnigy Aerodrive SK3 - 5045-500kv Brushless Outrunner Motor
> Controlleur : FVT Wolf 2-6s LiPo Batterie 120A Pro A imperméable Car Speed Controller ESC BEC
> batterie : Multistar High Capacity 6S 10000mAh Multi-Rotor Lipo Pack
> Télécommande : Quanum 2.4Ghz 3ch Pistol Grip Tx & Rx System

This is corresponding video: [klick me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=admVXqaa8NE)

How can he get 30km range out of a 222Wh battery? 

Not so sure if I believe this claim ...

its a small motor and if he is really light and only rides flat, he should be able to reach about 30 km range. Normally you should be able to reach about 20 with that battery.

with my riding style on my 6s board (6364 sk3 245kv + 150a x-car beast), I get about 12-14 km range out of a 6s 8000mah lipo
