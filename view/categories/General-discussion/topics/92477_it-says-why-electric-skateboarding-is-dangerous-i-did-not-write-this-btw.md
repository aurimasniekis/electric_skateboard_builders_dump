He's blaming a death on electric skateboard when the guy collapsed while riding it.

If he collapsed while driving a car, there would be probably two or more people dead instead of just the one that collapsed.

He's full of shit.

You can write a far more damning article about how dangerous cars are.  Because they are.

Definitely has an underlined agenda. Probably a politician with investments in oil companies. I just wonder who it is because they came after the DIY community in a strange way by saying that fixing it diy is a bad idea. Apparently he has never seen this forum. Lol this is where the tech gets thought of, we are the ones coming up with ways to solve these problems. Please keep esk8 
as professional as possible. the more we do stupid shit like riding in department stores or through the local mall is just asking for us to get banned completely. I'm all for rebellion but I'm hoping the cause would be more serious than illegal smart esk8 transportation revolution üòÅ

What about how dangerous animal products are. They kill 80 000 000 000 animals each year and are responsible for a huge amount of climate change and suffering: http://www.worldwatch.org/files/pdf/Livestock%20and%20Climate%20Change.pdf
Have way too much fat for a healthy diet and cholesterol in it.
Damn animal products are freaking dangerous but are we stopping it? Maybe a few... maybe we should, okay that was a stupid comparison...
But we don't kill or harm anyone but ourselves if we crash or collide with something in 99% of the cases so we should know the risks and store the boards and batteries in a place that doesn't burn that easily and wear protective gear, but this is no reason to stop it, it's just to remind ourselves to take care?! Cars have freaking explosions in them 24/7... maybe we need to upgrade the cases for batteries but improvement comes with time. Petroleum cars are terrible either way, esk8s are already better and can only improve further! What was the cause for the boosted recall too high amp settings on the esc or what?

Talking about this kind of thing could you build a go-cart style thing based on an esk8 only difference being a steering wheel to turn it

Would that work just having a wider deck and some wider axles with scaled up parts and electronics

Don't get me started about how dangerous :skull: dihydrogen monoxide :skull_and_crossbones:  is.

* It kills thousands every year.
* If you accidentally breathe it in, you'll die within minutes.
* It accelerates corrosion.
* It causes suffocation.
* It's a major component of acid rain.
* It has been found in excised tumors of terminal cancer patients.
* It's an additive in many junk foods.
* It's a major cause of traffic accidents.

Nice Honda bro gotta love the look of those s2000s. What motor is in it, h22? About 15 years ago I had a Toy 22RE pick up built a custom intake to run a make shift turbo I plucked from a junk yard and fitted some hooker headers. Put 200k on the truck myself ended up selling her still kicking at 300k. but she kept up with the s2000, blew out civics and small block mustangs no problem. But that was a lifetime ago. Now I'm all about watts and amps instead of Torque and HP. these days I drive a Dodge Cummins that can't make a rt turn to save it's life and an over priced geo metro/2018 Hyundai Elantra that pretends to be fast. but that's Parenthood and I wouldn't trade it for the world. I spend more money on diapers, wipes, and shampoo per month though than I've ever spent on my Esk8 or projects for my businesses. Lol nice car though bro keep the dream alive lol

@Dirt_Bag you have no idea how many articles I read that makes it into my news feed with all kinds of errors. I can admit I have errors all the time in my day to day comments. But I'm also not trying to be a professional reporter or blogger or whatever they call it these days. It's a lack of work ethic.

Yeah bills suck but seeing the look on my 7month olds face when I sing her the head, shoulders, knees n toes song, is worth every sacrifice I'll ever make. But God man I have gray hairs, a fake hip that I'm currently sitting in the ER to find out if I need a new one now after  7years. I guess these last few esk8ing hasn't helped. My kids are my biggest supporters when it comes to my business they are the first to see my innovations and they give me some really good feedback. Hell if it wasn't for my wife and kids I'd dig a cave and live it cause I can't stand this society. Buts that a whole other topic haha

from: **How to evade the leading cause of death in the United States**

"Americans are afraid of a lot of things: public speaking, heights, snakes, clowns and flying, just to name a few. Only some of these things can kill you, and none of them are likely to.

When it comes to flying, you've probably heard this before: You're more likely to die from a lightning strike than in a plane crash. [It's true](https://injuryfacts.nsc.org/all-injuries/preventable-death-overview/odds-of-dying/). You're also more likely to die from being attacked by a dog, stung by a bee or choking on your food.

But chances are you haven't thought too much about the [**leading cause of death for people in the United States ages 1 to 44**](https://www.cdc.gov/injury/wisqars/LeadingCauses.html): **unintentional injury**. In 2016 (the latest year for which data is available), 61,749 people in that age group died as a result of an unintentional injury, nearly twice as many as from cancer and heart disease combined. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, **these deaths were predominantly a result of motor vehicle accidents** and unintentional poisonings."

Did I miss the part where this guy made wild accusations or was biased in any way? He reported a few incidents that made the news where people were hurt. Some of the linked articles are very supportive to the riders involved. 

Esk8 is dangerous, more so than bicycles and scooters. You don't need proof of that: when comparing to bicycles which make up the majority of non auto transport, they operate with less stability and are harder to learn on. Not only are they likely less stable, operators are moving faster on esk8 than a bicycle in many cases.  Bicycles don't have to worry about a pebble abruptly stopping the <80mm wheels and launching the rider and most importantly, they come with safety reflectors to improve visibility of the operator. 

Esk8 is quickly earning a label as a commuter device and not just a hobbyist item. That label will put them into regulation. Esk8 needs to get ahead of that - talking to you boosted and the other big companies. 
Most riders don't wear safety equipment at all. They're operating on public roads with none of the safety/visibility equipment required for many other devices and these things will get the attention of your local government as injuries happen. 

I didn't find the author to come off biased at all. if anything, some of our reactions were biased in discrediting the article for no other reason then "esk8 rocks and we don't like your post." Which, lets be honest, will be a losing game in the long run for esk8 legislation

Edit: Like everyone, I've taken plenty of rides on skateboards, bikes, motorcycles and ATVs with no helmet on. But please please please do not think that just because its a short trip or youre not doing a high speed run that it is at all safe to not wear safety equipment. As a former paramedic, I have seen plenty of cases where people were seriously injured or died just "going around the block". A fall from standing to the edge of the curb with your head can kill you if youre doing 0mph. Pavement is no joke, and brain injuries not only have poor survivability but even worse return to normal stats. No matter how experienced you are, you cant control everything around you. Be safe, stay out of the news

I find it suspicious and coincidental that the study comes out of Singapore (extraordinarily strict laws on the spectrum).

Also, the linked article of "5 fatal accidents involving hoverboards, electric skateboards and scooters"

1. 2 of the 5 fatalities weren't even on a skateboard
2. That is 5 fatalities (again, not even all on skateboards) between 2010 and 2016 that they reported on. Less than one death a year is your argument?
3. The guy written about in the article collapsed, police investigation says no cars were involved.

It seems to me he had a medical issue while riding and is lucky that his pregnant wife wasn't riding in a car with him instead or it could have been 3 casualties at least.

Safety first, always. But this article definitely has a vendetta vibe.

Repeat after me, "skateboarding is inherently dangerous." Crazy right! Who would have thought that riding a board with wheels attached would be dangerous??! People should be responsible for their own actions or lack of action in regard to safety equipment. 

But I may be wrong in my sentiment, the world might indeed be a better place if legislation makes it illegal to swim without a pair of floaties.

But a safety commission isn‚Äôt looking at just fatalities. Injuries without death can frequently go unreported. The incident of accidents is much higher than the # of deaths associated with the esk8. Those aren‚Äôt stats either, they‚Äôre just examples. But if you could flick a switch and make the # of esk8 riders = the number of bicyclists, you‚Äôd see a much more realistic display of accident potential. The n value is just too small

No doubt on the sample size. 

Your "flicking" of a switch also doesn't take into account the gradual induction of esk8 into mainstream culture and the learning curve that naturally comes with it. If you flipped a switch and replaced all gas cars with electric, the number of accidents would increase as well.

New technologies yield new regulation. New regulations stem from accidents and incidents. It is the natural process of cultural evolution. 

There was a massive hatred when cycling became more mainstream and cities began to make designated bike lanes. Accidents were/are rampant because no one was forced to go back to driving school to learn how to deal with this change of laws and lanes. Cycling neglect and car neglect can both cause accidents in that industry: it can here as well.

Drive carefully, protect yourself, and the rest is up to politics :man_shrugging:
