Hi everyone!

I’m looking for a versatile board that can stay stable at higher speeds while allowing me to do dances on it(that’s as far as I’ll take it when doing tricks) but can also do Pneumatics or 107mm fly wheels as there’s alot of bad roads and cracks in my area. I’m currently torn between going the DIY route or going for a Lacroix DSS550+. I know the DSS500+ is a great board but shipping costs are difficult to justify($400 USD) while going DIY is something I’ve never done but if it can meet my needs while keeping the price from hitting $3000(cost of DSS550+ including shipping) then I’d be willing to explore that. I’d like to be able to go abit off road, just gravel, dirt and grass but no rugged mountain board terrain and no jumps. 

As for going the DIY route I find the Loaded basalt tesseract or chubby unicorn to fit the kind of versatile deck I’m looking for which is decent flex, wide, good for carving but stable at high speeds. They offer alot of space to work with and allow variable wheel bases to use.

What are your thoughts or suggestions with what I’m looking for for my next all around daily use Eboard? Cheers!

I'd go with a loaded vanguard, even though it has some flex and it's not considered a downhill board, you can go pretty fast and it's extremely fun to ride. This was my first built board and the only one I don't want to get rid of, I went through so many upgrades on it, I'm making a last full upgrade soon.

I do like the loaded vanguard as I’m actually using a vanguard clone on a Chinese Manufacturer board but I noticed toe/heel overhang without the W concave which I notice makes a significant difference in being able to control the board when carving. It’s a solid deck nonetheless! Thanks for the suggestion. I also like the feel of having wheel wells that help with planting my feet securely which I believe is absent on the vanguard. I’m open to other brands besides loaded as well. I like the landyachtz Evo but I’m concerned about the clearance as there are speed bumps where I skate and it being asymmetric.

Also curious did you go with the 42” deck or the shorter one?

I went with the flex 3, shorter version. It's a perfect size for transporting and riding, at least for me 1.70mt height.

The Evo is also a pretty nice deck as well, ground clearance is not that bad, my city is full of speed bumps and I can go over every single one without issues. 

You could also consider the subsonic talon, beautiful deck, you could use pneumatics in future upgrades and it'll take them like a champ.

A other deck I love is the Moonshine sidekick, it's small enough to grab mall it, has a useful tail and has a sweet shape and all around board fur everyday use.

That’s awesome! Thanks I’ll look into subsonic. I feel like 36-39” is my preference for length while 9-9.5” width is what would fit my feet just fine without worrying about overhang. What characteristics in a deck should I check if I want to have the option to go pneumatics?

You could go pneumatics on any deck, just need to use the right set of risers. Check @mmaner spud

Great! I thought there were some characteristics or something that need to be taken into account when going for pneumatics. Is it a better idea, build-wise to select decks that don’t have kicktails?

Would it be possible to make an enclosure for the basalt tesseract? Would it be possible to swap that to a evo or the subsonic falcon? Love your enclosures as well awesome work!

i have a no name 48'' dancer that i use as my daily ride.. its fun... however its hard to dance on electric unless u let off the throttle or have ackmaniacs FW w/ cruise control

Awesome! Is it flexy? I’d max out deck length at 40” sorry whats ackmaniacs w/ cruisecontrol? Yeah I dont plan on practicing dancing with it throttled just going to cruise and let it free wheel

Sounds like a great daily driver board! Do you use it for commuting or getting around as transportation? Is it difficult to travel with it? Not necessarily on flights. Do you have a link to your build for it?

I agree with carvon but they are insanely expensive as good as they are. I noticed they are not very torque-y? I dont know anyone in my country who has it yet lol

i dont really have a build post for it... the only one i am even considering doing a build post for is Hummies deck when i finish it. and its a great board... keep in mind im 6' and 215lbs, lots of boards bend under me when they dont for others... also my definition of "heavy" or light is relative to my size... I dont consider it to be a chore to carry or travel with, but Im a bigger guy... i also have a 10s5p pack on it and dont really run out of battery power ever

Oh that’s awesome! Aren’t they difficult to come by right now? I like how it reduces the parts and complexity of the build because of the absence of pulleys but I hear it doesn’t allow for as mucb customization with the torque vs top speed through the use of pulleys

Either torque or carvon’s can be used with pneumatics right? I wonder how well they hold up against debris hitting them

[/quote]

well I plan to try and help in that area... I made a circuit that uses relays to swithc between terminations on the fly which means u can have torque or speed on demand depending on ur termination.... Now i am working on a new circuit that is even SMALLER but involces more circuitry and a pcb so... we'll see how it turns out

as for the debris, i cant answer tht as i dont have either yet, but come september when i get my funds i will be buying a set and making covers to help protect against them

Woah really interested in that! So you just need to re-wire it on the fly to suit the ride you want? Not having to worry about belts/chains or gears is nice over the long run as there aren’t any other factors that you need to check on for the x years that you’ll be using the build. That’s my two cents on maintenantfor those drive systems

Yeah I saw the sneek peek of @torqueboards. Looks really promising and if I can fit pneumatics for some light off-roading then I can see myself picking up a pair for sure! Would love to get protectors for it as small rocks and pebbles are often in my path

pretty much, so in one termination you get torque at the cost of ur top end... useful for climbing hills and initial take off. in the other termination, u get a greater topend at the cost of torque, useful for flat land and cruising.... by having a switch u can get the best of both worlds, the only problem i am facing RN is i dont know how they will act with the vesc, it could short them or confuse them. ALSO if u are at full throttle and u hit the switch u will either be slowing way down or speeding way up, either way u will go flying.... so i need a way to tell the board to brake slowly and delay the switch until a specific rpm is met (when going from speed to torque) and a way to delay the throttle ramp up when going from torque to speed so the board doesnt shoot from under you

also i always build 2wd but i am wanting to do a 4wd in the near future

Very ambitious project that the rest of the builder community can definitely build upon and help out with! Unfortunately hardware isn’t my strong suite so just building my first eboard already feels like a daunting task. I may just put it off until I can decide on the drive train to use as that’s integral for the build

Nice I would’ve done the same thing! Do the carvon deives handle inclines well? I would like the confidence of riding it up hills and over damp roads after a moderate rain shower. I’m thinking an evo or tesseract deck with pneumatics on the carvons XL’s. What do you guys think?

I think it might be because they do not have the torque needed to tackle large hills and off-roading when coupled with a large pneumatic wheel

That’s unfortunate. I may have to go with belts for the mean time until direct drives can dish out the torque for steeper inclines and grass/gravel though I’m sure they perform well on flat roads

@Wraith I LOVE that deck, its got such a long stance when your foot is on the trail - feels really stable at least up to 30mph

I tried a overland deck the tail felt so limp and flat after using this, i got a psychotiller split enc. to fit fairly well (building my second one with some offroad tires :)

@sk8l8r That’s awesome! Do you have build log for it? Its the basalt tesseract right? I’ve only seen the truncated tesseract so far on the forum. Are you going to be running pneumatics on it or the MBS offroad wheels like the ones from enertion? Would you need spring suspension on it to get a proper AT build? I imagined it could handle the speed really well because its a downhill board. Do you have the trucks on set to the longer wheel base?

its the lush machine  https://lushlongboards.com/buy/machine-3d/

not started it yet just collection parts while im doing my current build (this is taking every second of my non work time lol https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/clone-evo-landyachtz-evo-falcon-boa-100-13s5p-top-mount-focbox-sk3-6374-metr-pro/57765)

its going to be pneumatics not decided one the type yet but since I got my Bajaboard years ago all I wanted was to try some real off road with a real kick tail :) 

I have my Bajaboard for real proper off road and if I tried to DIY some suspension I would def. be disappointed 

And planning on TB218 trucks.
