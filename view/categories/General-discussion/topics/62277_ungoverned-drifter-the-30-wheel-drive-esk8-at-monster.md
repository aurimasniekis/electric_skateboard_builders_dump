It totally broke the convention and notion of skateboard. Now, you probably heard of two-wheel drive and four-wheel drive, but have you heard of thirty-wheel drive? Well, as ridiculous as it sounds, Drifter is in fact a thirty-wheel drive electric vehicle. Little is known about the technicality at this point. What we do know is, it has over 70 balls that serve as the vehicle’s wheels, of which, an undisclosed powertrain drives over 30 numbers to afford motion. That’s for now and oh, it is patent-pending too. Anywho, future iteration will likely see it having seventy-wheel drive. Yes. Seventy-freaking-wheel-drive! This is just the beginning of a revolution in electric skateboard.

Drifter is not designed with roads on mind, though it certainly can take on mundane flat terrains too. Drifter is primarily an off-road leisure vehicle, an ATV of sort, but it will be a lot more versatile. Future development will see it getting more power that will allow this monster of electric skateboards to make off-road vehicle requisite air time.

It is not going as fast as it should. Moreover, the prototype, which tips the scales at 19.4 kilograms (42.8 lbs!), is predominantly solid steel frame. However, the eventual product is likely to be constructed out of carbon fiber and titanium elements which will definitely slash the weight dramatically without sacrificing robustness.

Is it just me or do those "wheels" look like tennis balls? Prob. why it has so many wheels/balls each one can't bear too much weight?

I can't even begin to think of the amount of problem solving that went into this build.  How to drive thirty tennis balls, let alone sleeving the things for bearings.  Bloody tennis balls lol 
who even thinks like that?
I'm not sure if I have just watched a video of the most ridiculous build I've ever seen or the work of a genius.
Definitely interesting though

Ahhh then to me that is 3,000 comma is a thousand. Period means I ignore everything after the second zero
