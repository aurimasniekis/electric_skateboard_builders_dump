Hi all, 

I'm fairly new to the electric skateboard community, I have been looking around at a few parts and I have thought that the best option for me at the moment is to just buy a kit. I have been looking around at a few kits available and I have found one of Ownboard. I am just wanting to know if anyone has purchased this kit before and what it is like quality wise and whether it is worth it or not.

Thanks

I would very much suggest doing research and starting with a simple full diy build.

It has to be said though, for the money that is not a bad kit at all, you'll feel its limitations quickly however and the ride won't be comfortable.

You will pay more for that and get less than something like this

Hell using a flipsky 4.20 plus, some lipos in 8s config, a cheap bms, boardnamics or dicky mounts, two second hand motors, ikea plant tray enclosure and scavenged drivetrain you could build an amazing board for next to nothing.
