Just wondered if anyone has ever used standard super glue to stick cuts on their skin ? 
I'm thinkIng quick repair whilst working/building

Works great but leaves scars. Originally, it was invented for field medics

Do it all the time at work.
Packing a deep cut with black pepper will help stop the bleeding too.

Yes if it looks like it needs 2 or 3 stitches glue will suffice. That and I don‚Äôt want to bleed everywhere for a week.

I did this on a deep cut to.the bone and it healed up nicely. I've gotten worse scars from stitches.

Well I have just tried it with the standard hobbie super glue it seem ok, let's see how the day lasts. I get cracked skin in the winter, that's what it's for, I've  tried all sorts of creams but ended up just using plasters( band aid) for a quick relief . The superglue feels good at the moment üëç

Super glue may  be a bit excessive for cracked hands. 

I'd try spray on or liquid bandaid. It works wonders.

For a less dangerous but equally annoying solution just put sachets of sauces underneath the seat stands on the toilet seat.

Well it didn't last long on my cracked skin. Applied it a couple of times but didn't hold for long. Probably because it was on the end of my finger.

I was sharpening my knife one day, and it fell off the table. Clipped my knee on its way down. Cut so deep I could see fat tissue. Superglue ftw

Here is an article about the toxicity of " superglue"
https://www.researchgate.net/publication/8577776_Toxicity_of_Cyanoacrylate_Adhesives_and_Their_Occupational_Impacts_for_Dental_Staff

Why would you use stuff that may glue the cut together inflexible !!!! because its polymerization makes it stiff and brittle - our skin is flexible and at the same time chemical reaction slows down healing ? 
Why not using ducktape !!!! lol 
just kidding. 
I have really good experience with Butterfly strips ( Buterfly wound closure, steri strips) , its waterproof, flexible and sticks like crazy. As a silly mountain biker - i have lots experience - they work . ( even in cases you need stitches , they bring you home safe, or to the next doc )

Correct! It's an osbourn cpm-m4 steel. Holds an edge for months, but gotta keep it oiled to keep it from rusting.

I like that straight blade!! I'm a tool nut in general, and knives are the hardest tool to do without imo. Heard great things about those spiders! I also have a nice Kershaw as well as the Osbourne. Having a good pocket knife is a  necessity for me, I just feel naked without it. I like to be able to shave with them.

Knives led to sharpening goodies which led to woodworking handtools and straight razor shaving, which lead to more sharpening/stropping stuff. Which led to microscopes to examine edges, and it goes on and on. Lol.

EDIT that orange knife is a special one! a "sprint" knife, HAP40 tool steel (good competitor to M4) sandwiched in soft stainless steel. The blade shape was a design by a forum member in the Spyderco forums. This guy proposed this shape, and everyone was shitting on him. The owner of Spyderco popped into the thread asking for more details so he could make a prototype...

https://www.spyderco.com/forumII/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=70607&sid=2fd34846aa12df58728074a29284ee4f

He made a video when he got the proto (he's a cook)

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sczu0kXNswQ

And it made it into production.

budget sharpening system
[/quote]

sharpmaker is good! If budget probably one of the EdgePro Apex clones. You can wrap the sharpmaker sticks in sandpaper to get things going faster.

Was gonna also suggest the DMT clamp kit. :slight_smile:

Wharnies are really easy to sharpen. :) Usually it's the EdgePro Apex if I want a crisp bevel, but for EDC ones either Japanese waterstones (I'm terrible at freehand but wharnies are easier), or this :slight_smile:

So fast and wicked with the leather wheel to finish. And cheap! Will make your knife ugly, like a good user.
