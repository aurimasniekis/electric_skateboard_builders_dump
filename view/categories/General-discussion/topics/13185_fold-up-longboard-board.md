I've just seen this from the guys at Braille. And it got me thinking of getting one to convert into a foldable esk8. Check it out!

I was JUST about to post this. Glad I searched first ;)

So who's going to be the first to electrify one?

thanks for sharing - been thinking about this, cool that someone made it even more advanced (with the anti - pinch) mechanism..

We've been trying to find the dimensions on this. Estimating from the images, a Mellow might be juuuust a big too long. Too bad.

Self folding is a bit of a stretch. An electric one would fit the bill though.

Nice to see there's already a thread about this. :slight_smile: I just finished watching the video.
 
The $300 for two deal isn't too bad. I've pretty much convinced a friend to get one, so I now I just have to make sure I want one! Haha.
I wonder if it would be difficult to split the enclosures (electronics/batteries) and have a cable running across the bottom.. and have it not get caught.

Wondering if anyone went thru on this and made it electric? I want to make one but with the boardup because it can hold more weight

@Lambjr088 spoke to the creator of the board, he was interested, but then kind of went dark and disappeared.

Hey All! I made it electric! lol. I actually finished it in August of 2017 and have been riding it ever since. I planned on using the entire Bourdup deck and all the parts, but when I received it, I couldn't fit the electronics under that board. So, I only ended up using the hinge and the kick release plate, and replacing everything else. Here are some pics!! @barajabali [IMG_7252|375x500](upload://2vyY2GP7SEx0VWz9rmMsgMp6Adj.JPG)![IMG_7713|375x500](upload://8R7jD2OuoKtMEnxFbA4ZKtuBnhg.JPG)![IMG_7714|375x500](upload://1Osmzq4k5IX2M4cctMHh1gkZJBL.JPG)![IMG_7254|375x500](upload://6IjOZ0qFyxoIZyJwSElpKkS5uVy.JPG)![IMG_7255|666x500](upload://pf5hBheUKEQ1B18RYrRj0CDdmev.JPG)![IMG_7715|666x500](upload://9KFG5PgztYpCcGxXoCDza9QQBJv.JPG)

What made you choose to move the trucks inward? Would this not cause wheel bite?

If you don't move ones set of trucks forward or back, the front and rear wheels will hit each other when you fold it in half. You can see what I mean in this picture. And no, I haven't gotten any wheel bite.

Yeah but why not just cut the deck at different lengths? So it's not in the centre
```

Because then it won't stand upright when its folded. Would be like having one leg shorter than the other.

I just finished mine. Riptide parts and an Atom board. Took me two tries to get the board perfect.

Looks awesome man!! Well done. Working on my 3rd version of it now. Moving over to the hub kit from Enertion. 4th version might be a custom deck and hinge. Love being able to put it in a backpack! What size batt you use?

You guys don't rate the BoardUp deck that it comes with? 
Still not possible to buy only the mechanism?

We arnt using the deck that comes with it. It was too short for all my parts to fit under. If I had a shorter battery It probably would have worked fine. I am using a 10s3p. Im not sure if it is possible to buy just the hinge. It wasn't when I bought it.

Riptide has two batteries that fit in their enclosure. One airline safe -7 miles and a 14 miler.

I attached the hinge to an Atom board and used the Riptide enclosure. Makes it 22‚Äù folded so a little longer. Actually using the Riptide parts too but if only I was good enough or rich enough to have my Carvons as the motors. Still waiting on small pneumatics for the perfect board though. What direct drive are you using.
