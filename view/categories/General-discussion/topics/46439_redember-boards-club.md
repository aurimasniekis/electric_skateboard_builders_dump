I'm on a bassist forum as well as this one, and they have certain clubs for certain brands (Ibanez, fender, etc.). Since I've seen quite a few Redember decks out there by now, I figured why not start one here? If you have one, feel free to post:
-How many you own
-What type
-What configuration you used it for/with
-Pictures!!!

I’ll start: 
I own 1 Shuggah deck (the first!)
10s6p config w/soon to be VESC6 and 6” pneumatics!

In a word...craftsmanship.  

They are perfectly constructed, the drop is enough to 'lock in' but there's enough clearance for a decent size enclosure, the length and width is perfect for a comfortable powered board.  There's nothing bad about these decks...fuggin awesome.

@Deckoz  All good! I understand how it could be confusing.

@evoheyax the reason these boards are so amazing is because everything from the experience to the detail to just the rediculously comfortable board makes them stand out from the rest of the pack. There’s just nothing like it. If you managed to convince @treenutter to start making your decks with built-in enclosures I might just buy one...

Wow thanks everyone! I'm humbled. I'm so glad that everyone's deck is meeting their expectation! It is amazing to see all these builds, to see how each person's style and talent transforms a "deck" into a "build." When I get positive feedback like this, it adds fuel to my fire, and encourages me to keep going!

Designing and making decks by hand is my passion - and sharing one's creativity with the outside world can be a risk. We're all safe in our private "zone" busily following our creative instincts. Whether it's a bedroom, a shop, or a sketch on a napkin - the joy of creating feels very personal. When you start to send that work into the world, though, you don't know what will happen. There's haters, there's folks that judge you, there are lots of reasons not to share your art. 

What gets me to put it out there anyway is the hope that if I focus, designing and building with earnestness, that I can share a good experience with others. My hope is that someone will glance at their deck from across the room, or step on it for a ride everyday, and that they'll think "**Fuck Ya!**" every time, stoked to get moving - to enjoy the freedom and excitement we all know. "Stoked" is a concept I've never been able to fully explain to folks who don't ride. But if you know it, then you know what I mean.

That's what I want to feel - "Fuck Ya!" every time I step on a deck. Nothing about it can be cheap, or rushed, or generic. 

When I make a deck for someone, I put a lot of heart into it... like i would if it were my own. So to see all of you enjoying them is immensely motiviating. Thank you for that!

So I made my choice and ordered the Mas deck from @treenutter. What sealed the deal for was the new enclosure @psychotiller made specifically for it. 
https://psychotiller.com/product/mas-235-enclosure

You will need to contact redemberboards on instagram to look at his website.

My dilemma: Drop through or Top mount. I'd like some pics if anyone has them straight from the side with an enclosure with six shooters only. Also clearance measurements from the enclosure to the ground. I find some topmounted decks are way too tall. Thanks for any help

It has a pretty good amount of drop. I tried to mount one dropped with SR RkP trucks and it was too low for pretty much any battery clearance. Top mount? Perfecto!!!!!

just took delivery of a caldera.  @treenutter mentioned he was experimenting with a new finish, it's a dark blue, black when you look at it in certain angles.

utterly beautiful.  excellent craftsmanship.

only problem is, it's so pretty i don't want to do stuff to it.

but...it's going to make an excellent platform.

@thisguyhere thanks man I’m glad you’re enjoying it! I’m looking forward to seeing the full build!

@lrdesigns the coloring is done by hand with dyes and stains. The finish comes from a lot of practice with a hvlp spraying system. I’d say that time and care, along with using the best materials, yields the unique look.

any suggestions on what can i do to preserve as much of the finish?

that's to say, if i just put grip tape on this deck, the nice finish is going to be covered up.

maybe clear grip?  or...grip it partially?

Maybe some lucid grip? I've the same predicament with a custom deck 

so bought some 12" polytunnel clear tape, plan is to lay it, spray it with adhesive spray and throw on clear tread-tex, then hit the top with PU spray 

with this method...and forgive me but I have not tried it yet, but with care and a hairdryer, the polytunnel tape has a chance to lift without removing the stain

@thisguyhere many customers partially grip... leaving the tails and the middle without. Lucid's another good choice.

I like @briman05 's idea as well - I'd suggest using a water-based spar, even though it should be OK to put an oil-based finished on top of a water-based coating (if it's completely dry...in theory)

I think partial gripping is cool, but the tail is definitely not a place I'd partially grip.  That's the second place I would apply grip

I won’t be gripping the ends of my mas deck since it will have a abs and printed cover with a light. The rear also has an abs cover. I don’t think I would grip the ends of any of the RedEmber boards personally. None of them are kick tails. But hey to each his own right.

I use water based spar for everything because it is an easier clean up. What I do is layer of spar with glass while it is still wet. Then let it dry completely then do a layer or 2 on top and it is good.

@treenutter can you wedge the truck mounts? Similar to Evo? 

Was dreaming about a bludgeon with +7 front -15 rear, in tiger maple, with an iron stain(rusted steel wool water react with tannins). But think your utilizing only one press with different deck shapes?

Also @treenutter just a side note in case you were wondering about the wedging choices I made above

Rakeless end result on the Evo was 53/35
Rakeless rear with +3 raked front is 59/35 

With 50 degree trucks, the wedging I mentioned 57/35 (+7/-15) puts it smack dab in the middle to make it tuneable for a stable directional electrified platform rakeless or raked. Anyway PM me if you ever decide to experiment with truck mount wedging :)

Maybe possible to adapt the press to offer a variety of camber of the tails, in theory removable press wedges top/bottom pointing opposite directions on each end

Sounds awesome 🤙🏻

I'd be stoked to join the club later this summer if you'll have me

Great! I'm after a @Deckoz collab board based on the Evo,so this will be a reuse of the same design.

When the form is worked out I'll hit you up with a DM to go over specs:veneer, stain choices and spurious elements for no good reason,thank you @treenutter

Thanks, it's redember's company logo with a twist.
I scanned the logo with his permission of course and added my touch then put it in a .dxf file and had it Laser printed. I may do some more and put them up for sale.

hey guys, I have just received my enclosure for my caldera. Thanks @psychotiller

I've got 90mm wheels but I think I have going to have to go up to 107's or get some decent size risers. What does everyone use?

Also want to mount it as tidily as possible, I see a bit of a mix of inserts vs skate hardware. Thoughts?

Well I wrote this and left it in limbo 😂 so here it is...

I received my RedEmber Mas Deck. It was shipped on the 14th and received mid day on the 18th to Ontario Canada 🇨🇦. Awesome fast shipping. Should be a fun build. I posted a few pics on the “no words” thread and snuck one on on the surfrodz rkp mounts thread. Many more to come. I’m picking away at things slowly and will make a build thread eventually.

It’s coming along slowly. I’m just sorting out where I want the motor wires to come around and enter the enclosure. Then cut the holes for that. I’m waiting on a set of “those x things” so I can permanently mount the trucks. I bought some extra versa pulleys. I’m going to add a slice to each side and run 15-16mm wide belts. Then just mount all the electronics. Holyman92 is printing me a xt-90 mount and cover from manner’s thingverse page. Yesterday consisted of breaky with my buds, hanging by the pool and having a few brews and burgers and only about 45 minutes of build time. Almost there. I actually got to stand on it yesterday. Badass is a good word 👍

Setup is focbox’s from the wiz, dexters 170kv 6355 sensored motors running foc, 12s4p 30q’s and metr pro. Should be a sweet ride.

Haha no worries, my biggest problem now is to use the 45° hangers or 50° hangers. I wanted 45 rear and 50 front. I may need the 50° in rear though to gain some ground clearance for the motors. I’m gonna try some 3/16 riser pads first and see if I get what I want. It’s looking pretty good in the last pic for clearance though.

Ok tires filled up and flex test done. Seems to me it’s going to be a lush ride on the six shooters. With the clearance for the motors I am seeing I think i’ll try rear mounting too.

Also, draw a line where the neck starts to drop.

@Sender you need to chill out, you're making me want to chuck my deck in the trash. Stupid lack of money. I swear if I was rich... maybe I'll rob my own restaurant, they're insured and they wouldn't expect an inside job right? 

On a more rational topic, anyone have one of these micro drops that can chime in with some feedback? @treenutter , could you do a micro without any dye or finish so I could electrocute it?

Ahhhh....


You want a "sender special Soma" with no battery cut out or with the cutout, just an extra ply or 2.

Trust me.


He is making me one to skin, it will be clear coated to protect from warping but can be sanded off quick for whatever you want to do (electrocution in your case)


Also, the deck is as you described
