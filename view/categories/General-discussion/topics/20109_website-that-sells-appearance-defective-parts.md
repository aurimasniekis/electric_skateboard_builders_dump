Hi,
I remember a few months ago, someone posted a website that sells wheels/boards/parts that are visually "blemished" but structurally sound. I looked through my browser history for anything of the sort and through google, but cant didn't anything. Maybe someone can post a reply  about it.

Defective is a pretty harsh word. Try searching for blemished or something like scratch and dent

Was just trying to find a better word for blemished, I think not aesthetically perfect works too :stuck_out_tongue:

For real who cares about a scratch or two.
They all end up like this anyway.
