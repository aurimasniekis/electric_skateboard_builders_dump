Hello,
I would like your opinion.

Here is what I have ordered at Enertion.

1 x VESC-STANDARD
1 x SPACE CELL PRO3 Electric Skateboard Battery 
(Upgrade to Fast Charger 40% OFF: FAST CHARGER - Was $129 Now $78)
(Shipping from 30th Sep 2016)
1 x Mono Drive R-SPEC Pro 
(Get 64% Off Spare Belts Now Only: 4 Spare Belts - Was $67.85 Now $23.95

I have ordered a full skateboard minus the deck.

2 days ago, I have received 1 parcel containing: 
- a tiny box with the VESC: 
- a little box containing :

-1 truck
- bearings
- 2 spacers
- The wheel pouley
- 4 belts

In my DHL invoice, I can see I have paid the customs for:

"Mono Drive R-SPEC Pro"
"9mm Enertion Drive Belts"
"VESC-Standart"

So, the question is : is it a common way to receive the "Mono Drive R-SPEC Pro" incomplete ?
Or did I get the package of somebody else ?

The status of my order is Partially Shipped, but as they didn't sent the BATTERY + CHARGER I don't know if they consider they have sent the "Mono Drive R-SPEC Pro" completely as I have no vision on their website.

-The motor is missing
-1 truck is missing
-the wheels are missing
-motor mount is missing.
-the screws are missing

and even the motor pulley is missing, the sirclips etc...

What am I about to assemble with what they sent ? As I haven't ordered separated parts why did they sent the "Mono Drive R-SPEC Pro" partially, and why I have paid customs taxes for parts that were not in the package ?

Thanks for your ideas.
