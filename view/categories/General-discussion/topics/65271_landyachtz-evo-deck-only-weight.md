Does anyone know the weight of the full size 39" evo and the smaller 36" evo falcon?

For the life of me, I can't seem to find the deck only weight. All the info on the web is for completes only. 

thanks.

For the evo falcon I just did a general weight check and it 6 pounds with the truck baseplate with no hangers. Hope that helps
