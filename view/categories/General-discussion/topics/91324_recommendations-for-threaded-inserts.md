Hi Guys,

Anyone from the UK got a recommendation for a place or a link for some M5 threaded inserts that are stronger than the carbon zinc ones?

I've just destroyed some when putting them in and need something stronger.

Thanks in advance.

Jon

I had also a lot of issue with inserts, try to use m6 ones, so far it is way better

Changing to M6 is a fair bit of effort for this build, thanks though

Make slightly bigger holes and put in some wood glue/epoxy to make them stay in

I dont know about UK, im US. But I bought inserts called E-Z Lok, for the same reason. External zinc threads broke easily... E-Z Lok are steel. Several sizes. I bought mine online, thats my 2 cents.

M5 **self tapping** insert needs a 6.8mm drill bit, if the hole is right then the rest should work fine

Too sloppy and the insert comes back out again, to tight and the insert breaks

Talking about the self tapping type with a slot and not the type with heavy threads
