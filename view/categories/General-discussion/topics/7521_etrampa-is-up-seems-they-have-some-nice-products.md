Trampa boards had already eboard roadmap since for sometime and today I just saw their products on their website. They have both longboard and mountainboard with some really cool deck and mount.

http://www.trampaboards.com/electric-boards-library-c-442.html?all=1

They also offer some mount kit, very interesting. I guess I am gona wait abit for stock update and stuff like that. I also know how to get this boys to The Netherlands without paying heavy shipping price :smiley:

etoxx is nice, but price wise also quite expensive. It might be comparable with this new eTrampa. Thats why I am gona wait abit for some comparison and reviews!

As these existing companies in the skate space see other companies start to offer E boards then it's going to be a stampede.

I just dont get the price, they want about 500 euros for a MTB, and 900 euros for a partial eMTB (just motor and dirve train) Thats $400 for a motor, mount, pulleys, and a belt? All at wholesale price.. Dosnt quite click for me.

Wonder what the top speed it. They have a vid of them outrunning a train one of the boards. From some of the product title they say the motors are 118kv. We have similar trains where I live but they go like 40 mph... 

Anyways they look really good but I would like to see some more specs. I like the NEW SKOOL Electric long board a lot!

Trampa is expensive, no doubt about that. Carbon fiber and pounds makes it expensive. I am comparing if you buy holy pro set + etoxx and all other things would cost you almost 3k euro. With this I calculated abit less.

Their urban carver deck is what I am aiming for. Seems that the wheels are switchable from all terrain to stickies while the deck is a carbon fiber. More over the truck looks amazing. I dont know I feel that although it could be a hype, still worht to mentioned it here.

Good morning from Trampa!

Stuff is up, right. We still bang on the website though. 
To answer two Questions:
Yes, the carve board and urban carve board are the same, except the wheels and belt. So its easy to change in between the three setups (83, 90 and 7" wheels)

The price is according to our quality. Example: Our motors use ultra high temp copper and magnets, the best bearings you can get, hall and temp sensors, properly hardened steel axles, double kewway, fan cooling etc... They are hand wound - you could not get one more winding in. Nice Details like a special housing for air filters, all stainless nuts and bolts...
Again, its the quality that defines the price. 

Anyone thinking one could buy top quality for little $ is wrong. Quality and price go hand in hand - unfortunately that's the truth.

I hope you guys like our new little range of products. We try our best to provide all the components that were not really available yet to the DIY E-Skate builders. Its a little new universe to be explored. Everything is compatible to our existing product range!
Please click on "Parts used" below the image to see all the Parts involved. 

Greetings to all of you! DIY is really the way forward and so much more fun than just buying something. We will try our best to provide gear that helps to successfully complete and upgrade your personal projects. 

Frank from Trampa

Ceramics?

Whats the airgap in your motor?

Why do you need fan cooling? I used them on my last build, it might have had a slight effect. But esc's, batteries, or any other electronics shouldn't need fans. I haven't used fans for a while and never had any heat issues.

I clicked on a random e-board from trampa:

850 pounds.. that's about 990 euro's. Don't think that is very expensive. most e-boards based on trampa i've seen so far exceed that price. And this is a completely assembled board.

Not sure if I'm missing something, or that 'expensive' is relative to the beholder?

Tons of question....

Duals will be available as soon as Sam and Ted find the time to upload them and make the web pages. It won't be long until they display.

Flywheels should work, but I haven't tried that, no guarantee. We offer 83 and 90 mm wheels. We still wait for the 90mm though. 

Motor: The air gap is as small as it gets before you get scratches on the stator.
Bearings are high precision Japanese industrial bearings. COPPER and MAGNETS are made to highest Spec available in the market. You will not reach these temps. The FAN keeps the motor a bit cooler and supports the CAN at the front side. It blows some air to the internal PCB to prevent overheating, especially when using motor dust filters. Its a front side mounted PCB. I agree: If you setup your system correctly, you should not get overheating issues. I do also know: Some go crazy and love the extra strength in the design. We and our Customers love the max. Quality! 

Available in 118 and 136KV @ 1Nm

Sometimes I am bit overwhelmed by some of the questions here. Magnet gauss, air gap, temp rating.... People who bought ebike or ecar would never ask such things.

Im buying bmw because tesla motor airgap and temp is too high. Shit ridiculous.. Too much details.

Sometimes knowing this is important, sometimes. Especially if you are buying a motor.

You try, you buy or you dont.

Hi everybody!

I'm currently on holidays and not keen to spent the day with my smartphone. My Kids want my attention.

To keep our motor delicious, I would not fry them at higher temperatures than 200deg Celsius. 

Marketing: Yes, talking is marketing!
I just try to answer your questions. We did not start this conversation - what should we do? Not replying? You guys want the information, don't you? You also want the products, don't you? So I can't do it right.
If I answer its marketing, if I don't you will not get any answers. Please stay fair.

Exactly. I just hate how everyone hypes their shit to be the best, but doesn't want to release any details. I know they are probably pretty good. But to say you use the best bearings is a bold statement. Those bearings are probably pretty good, but ceramic bearings spin better and longer with less friction than steel balled bearings. So unless they are ceramic (which they don't appear to be), they are not the best.

Saying the airgap is as small as can be is always true with any motor. They will make it as small as they can, but the better motors have smaller airgaps (look at scorpion motors). So again, I know nothing.

Those kv's seem awfully low for a belt driven motor. The target for most is a 3:1 gearing and around 200 kv with a 10s. Whats the gearing like? Selling a system without the battery seems weird for a belt driven system, as choosing the right battery is crucial.

If you can back up your claims with numbers, that would be nice. So far, you have been beating around the bush with numbers.

@trampa you motor is $200, so the mount and drive chain is another $200, so they dual would be $1300? You quality is great no doubt about that, and I don't mind spending the money for a plain MTB, but when you put a motor and drive train on there for an extra $400 is dosnt click for me. If there is a really good reason to spend the extra money for a partial eMTB I wouldn't mind it, but would like a small explanation.. (not interrogating you just curious) also $ = Euro

@JLabs: Its a top spec motor and a top spec drive. The motor is not like the ones you can buy from hobby suppliers. It's really designed to our needs. The Drive Train features a quite funky shaped pulley, a belt tension system with tension roller, Strongbelt premium belts, 3K carbon panels, a hex shaped motor cage etc. With a little effort you can seal that thing off, build translucent covers and drop lights in. Its designed to be tweaked and changed to your needs. We know the DIY builders like to bang on stuff.
Regarding the price: You can buy a snowboard deck for 600-800, not including bindings. Our boards are expensive to make and feature trucks, bindings, wheels, special parts, motors, mechanics etc. + designed carefully. Design work is also something to consider!  Believe me, the price is very attractive for what you get.
Don't compare apples to oranges!
Our products are no mass produced goods!
Its an honest product for an honest price.
Click on "Parts Used" and see how many nice bits are included.

Thanks for your reply Frank, I wasn't questioning the price of your motor and boards. Just the mount and drive system. I'm not going to lie, it is expensive but it does seem worth it. I am going to build an eMTB and if I am going to sink this kind of money in it I want it to last. I have been pricing different types of eMTB and yours is competitive but a bit more expensive. So i think for the quality it may be worth the extra cash. 

Thank you again for the reply, it's more than appreciated, and after explaining and looking at the parts list may opinion is slightly swayed. Looking forward to see what u guys have in store for the future. - side note, about how much is the dual going to cost? (I am hoping $1200 ish, based on current prices)

@ Michaelinvegas: The belt is just long enough to fit the 7" pneumatic wheels. Its a carveboard, designed to take very tight turns (2m radius). Due to its design its stable at speed while beeing that agile.The deck tilts 30Â° + the board has a nice flex, so no numb feet after 30 mins of rinding. It swallows all the roughness of the road. Before judging it purely by its look, you should ride it. Its really amazing! Don't compare that mashine to a standard longboard, its completely different. I usually don't look back while riding, exept when taking a turn. 

This is a super early prototype Jens ( E-Toxx) made. Quick and dirty:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtEOlJsEHms
Look how tight the turns are.

Was tons of work, but we are happy with the results. Just nailed together a Trampa Longboard Proto, having a 12S 4P pack with Samsung Q30 3000mAh cells and did 50km on one charge at Berlin Tempelhof Airfield. The Battery was still good for some more miles, since 1500mAh was still left.
Really amazing how far you can ride on one charge. Actually our my feet were the weak point, not the Battery. We will post a video of that session soon. Dropping in 3500mAh cells would get you close to the 70km rang - but who wants to ride that long distances? Frank

@trampa just looking at those mounts & pulleys - are they designed only for Trampa wheels, or any of the usual wheels (Kegel / Abec 11)? I'm not sure how the Trampa wheels are designed, so would be keen to know.

If they are designed to allow other wheels, then assume would still work with 97mm Abecs?

Hi Oneafrikan, the Longboard mounts work with generic Abec11 clones, up to 90mm, using the motor support Bering. Without mounting the motor support bearing 97 should work.
Kegels don't fit.

We know about the price being relatively high, but the truth is: It's really low if you see what you get.

The most honest thing in this thread. I decided to "splash out" on a trampa board and i have been incredibly impressed. Its built like a tank, everything is machined and finished to a high quality. nothing feels like it would ever break or need replacing. Your buying a board that will last forever. you can swap and upgrade parts as your needs change. And should the worst happen and you break something you can buy spares for any part and know they will be with you next day. 

The best part is that this monster cost me less than a boosted board where everything is made of breakable molded plastic.

P.S.
If i could change one thing it would be the design of the carbon fiber motor mounting plate. I feel like there are a few small changes that could make maintenance a lot easier.

The problem is access to the little grub screw that is super important and grips the mount to the axle tightly.

 - Currently the only way i have found to tighten this grub screw is to remove the motor. 
 - Because the motor pulley does not fit through the hole in the mount you must remove the motor pulley to take the motor off. 
 - Because of the grub screw in the motor pulley you must first remove the belt to remove the motor pulley. 
 - Because of the belt tension and the lip on the motor pulley you must remove the wheel in order to get the belt off.

Why must i remove the wheel to tighten a grub screw in the motor mount??

I have 3 suggestions if you ever revise this part:
1. If you raise the motor up just a little higher you you would be able access to that little fucking grub screw without removing the motor.
2. it would be super easy for the motor mount center hole to be big enough for the motor pulley to fit through.
3. A couple more mm of travel in the motor adjustment would allow you to loosen the belt enough to get it off without removing the wheel.

I think we will change the design sooner than later, and I will look at the post when doing so.
Work in progress... I never had a motor mount come lose on me. 

THX for hour hones comment on our gear! I hope you will still ride our board in 10 years. 
If you replace the kingpin bushing once a while and service the bearings, these boards are indestructible.

+1.  Trampa is truly next-generation, today.

As a point of comparison, I took delivery of one of the first "next-gen" Pramash Lean boards last week. https://www.pramash.com and to put it kindly, in 30 years, the Pramash is the first deck that I've slid off of in a carve.  In fact, the Lean is so low to the ground that I get "heel bite" from the Earth - you must stand _only_ on the deck:

Three days later, I'm working with Treenutter on a replacement deck, a machinist on new motor mounts and modifying Hamboards springs... and this morning, our machinist asked if he can just remake the entire truck assembly (their single spring feels like it's grinding - needs a cam).

Fact is, I should have bought another Trampa, I knew it and even had it in my cart - but I thought "hey Lean looks next gen!" and wrong. I have builder's remorse lol.

It's not all bad; Pramash's 101MM wheels feel very good, actually.  We'll soon see how they hold up under torque.
