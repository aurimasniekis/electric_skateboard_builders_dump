HI guys,Happy Newyear! :kissing_heart:
I ordered 2 decks from @trampa
and its been 10days but still nothing coming up:disappointed_relieved:，anybody had the same experience？ It is so frustrating, they wont reply to any emails，I sent 3 emails to Ted Orr（their customer service head），but nothing back from him.  

I ve heard some bad mouth about trampas customer service so I came up here to seek your adivice,  what should I do?  
the order number is #14022 maybe trampas people can check it out for me

450€ is a not a lot for venders like trampa, but I had to saving up for months:sob:

Tony, happy new year.  The ball is dropping in New York and @trampa is hopefully well into a holiday, yet wanted to take a moment to help.  

Please, email your questions to david.garlinge@trampaboards.com and David will be happy to assist once back in the office.

Stoked to see your Trampa builds!  Happy 2019!
