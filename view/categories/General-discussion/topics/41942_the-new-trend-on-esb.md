Search!

The reason that we always say search is because that‚Äôs what will help the new user learn more useful information in the long run... we do genuinely have your best interests in mind

Search is the most educational tool we have here, and not because you can find an answer to your question quickly but all the information you have to parse to get to your answer. You learn lot more getting to the answer yourself than just being handed the answer. 
The people that spend hours pouring through posts to find what they need direct to search or in a certain direction because they know the answer is there, rarely to just shrug off somebody asking a question and stick around to help once you do find the answer

I get why some people are thinking that searching is annoying. It takes time, it forces you to read a lot of things. And sometimes the information is buried quite deep.

But it also gives you a looooot of information, and I think you often learn way more by searching, as you won't only read the answer to your question, but you'll often read things related to your question too. I've been spending a lot of time on the forum, without doing anything but reading. Now I'm able to build my first board.

[/quote]

This is the problem I'm trying to point out.
if YOU KNOW what topic would help them, 
then search for it, link it. 
mods can combine if appropriate.
 
But sending everyone to find the gold needle in the continuously growing and mostly irrelevant haystack is pretty useless....

This is kinda silly logic. If someone asks a simple question do you point them to the library?

I enjoy helping people who ask questions because it costs me very little time and saves them a lot of time. What would of happened if the guy who invented the wheel never shared it and told everyone to figure it out for themselves? We all stand on the shoulders of giants. If I can save someone some time answering a simple question maybe they can spend their time learning something else and when I need help they can save me some time and help me. 

Just my 2 cents.

Can we make it a community thing to give out ridiculous 'blueprint' parts lists?

Oh, you're looking to do a budget build that's good for **15mph on flat land** and has a **range of at least 5 miles**?

At minimum you're going to need:
4x Maytech 90mm hub motors
4x FOCBOXes
1x 12S4P 30Q battery pack

Don't come back until you've bought the parts...

It's not really the users,  it's the site and how it's setup, orr...not setup.

No stickies/pinned topics is the biggest issue here imo.
Categories should be on the home screen.

Each category needs index threads, with links to direct people to what they seek, or what they didn't even know existed..

Said index threads need to be locked, and pinned and  can be added to by asking a mod. 



The home screen shows latest [s]posts[/s] topics instead of a welcome page or category page or a how to use the site walk thru.


That's why people post random crap on whatever thread is at the top. 

And don't search, because there isn't any sticky thread showing how to search.
 -yes, you have to show people.. 

The search function does work well though.. 

I've used it a ton.

This is a big issue. Some topics should be pinned, or we should have a pinned topic with all important threads/must-read, organized in categories. This one http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/start-here-faq-for-diy-electric-skateboard-builders/215 is old and not up-to-date...

I think teaching other people to search first before asking is saving and teaching person ability to found out stuff themselves rather going around and asking everyone for the help... At least it's my point of view at work with new junior developers...

> You can only ask someone help if invested at least 15mins in search for the solution.

I'm pretty sure he's being sarcastic. The point is that if new users are so lazy that they refuse to at least try to find an answer before posting their question, we should give them advice that will result in a build that is way overkill for their purpose and if they are dumb enough to take the advice it shows they haven't researched at all and deserve to overspend on their board.

Right on the money. Worst case scenario, they build one hell of a board after going a tad over budget.

Agreed. The reason we love and encourage usage of the search bar is because it finds that gold needle for you, which is preferable to mods having to continuously clean up the irrelevant or repetitive topics that people make when they don‚Äôt use the search function.

This whole search button thing is not needed. I didn't even know there was a search button until I'd already started building my board. I got help from reading posts that others had made in building things. There is easily enough information for new users to start learning just from reading some of the build threads at the top of the forum.

 I understand that it gets annoying for older users having to answer the same questions all the time but I don't think telling them to use the search button is the right approach. Like someone else said I think there needs to be more basic topics pinned to the top of the forum

I have actually seen plenty of posts answered with a link to the search result obtained when introducing ops thread title in the search bar....
This exceptional cases are the ones slowly transforming random users into old users. 
O and this guy I remember who once opened 4 threads with the same question.  Some of them he opened when the question had already been answered in another of his threads

Ok here‚Äôs the bottom line on this forum:

Yes, there is a lot of clutter and repetitive topics.
Yes, there are a lot of new members who don‚Äôt really know what they‚Äôre doing yet.

But - the search function WILL find you what you‚Äôre looking for if you do it right. The only time when it is acceptable to start a new thread is if it‚Äôs asking a question that HASNT come up before, or informing the community about something new that HASNT been done before. The only reason that I don‚Äôt just close and delete every repetitive thread from new members is because telling them to use the search function will start to help them understand the general rules of how this community works, and when to start or not start a topic. And contrary to @saul‚Äôs belief, I do think that every bit of information you could ever need as a new or experienced member can be found in seconds with the search bar. The other day, I wanted to reprogram my Torqueboards 12S ESC, and hopefully deal with an overheating problem that it‚Äôs been having. You know what I did? I went to the search bar, typed ‚ÄúTorqueboards 12S ESC overheating‚Äù and ‚ÄúTorqueboards 12S ESC programming‚Äù and instantly found two threads with what I needed. This forum works just fine the way it is, and people who don‚Äôt use the search bar only perpetuate the problem of irrelevant information - which btw @saul does not ‚Äúfall into the abyss‚Äù, but rather may start to impede upon searches for information due to their extremely general titles and totally useless discussions.

FOR ANY NEW MEMBER WHO SEES THIS:

THE FORUM IS NOT CHANGING SOON, NOR ARE ITS GUIDELINES. DONT START USELESS TOPICS; PLEASE USE THE SEARCH FUNCTION

Have a nice day :slight_smile:

This is so true. If you find the solution to a problem it is your choice whether or not you share it and we all get to use our best judgement when we make this decision. 

For the simple easy questions I share. But my teleport device is for me :slight_smile:

Throwing my personal point in

I started out very and I mean very interested in the Hobbs in fact more the the average noobs I hade 4 days read time and watched every YouTube video I found 

This helped me understand everything I needed to know for a basic ‚Äú6s fvt sk3 build‚Äù 

But me digging deeper discovering bms lion made me more interested and here is the thing that confuses noobs I think 
Because when you say search and you search exactly for the what is a bms there is no instructions that comes up and noobs give up and create threads.
The title were the information is hidden has nothing to do with their question so the again give up instead of reading 

We need to make dedicated thread most important easily searchable or pinned! 

Now I‚Äôm pretty activ been upped to regular and knows almost everything needed and keeps up with the very lates so in the end it‚Äôs all about the builders initiative and will power to succeed 
// Byeee

probably an onpopular opinion from my side but, i consider beeing able to research/search for information a basic survival skill. if you cant do that, one must be either a realy lazy person or worse. if you cant do that, you probably shouldnt try to build an esk8 in the first place (security whise).

it took me a few days of research (this forum, blogs and youtube) to  figure out what to use and how to build an esk8. havent asked a single question (as far as i remember) because i found everything in here and applied some common sense  on what i couldnt find.

that beeing said, i think asking a user to search is a total legitimate answer as long as the topic title doesnt allready spit out search results (which it honestly does most of the times)
