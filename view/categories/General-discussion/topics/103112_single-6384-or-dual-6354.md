Hi guys, in need some help do decide which configuration to use: 
single 6384 170kv motor controlled with focbox on 40A most likely 
or dual 6354 180kv but if I go dual I would need to change the vesc to dual setup
I would like to use 97mm wheels and there are no hills but i'd like some torque im 200lbs
Thanks
```

I already have the focbox and i am wondering if it is worth to change it for dual (probably flipsky 4.12 or 4.20 dual +)

Duals IMO, at 200 lbs you’ll enjoy that extra tq from the 54s.  I run dual 6374s and can argue it’s a bit overkill, I just don’t put it the paces.

ok but i would need to change the battery probably becouse i have 10s5p  NCR18650GA 3500mAh and it can output 50a MAX

If it's flat where you live, a single 6380 will get you there. You can run a lower gear ratio and get some nut wrenching torque and still have a top speed north of 25.

Dual 6354. More tourqe more power more braking power more $$$ more better looking. 
But if ur 200ibs a single motor is not recommend vs dual anything. Personally I would go for dual 5055 vs Singel 6384. As u can guess I think dual is better. 

But what battery u got? 40A is not a lot. 7s 10s 12s?

Let's say u run at 10s that's 36V nominal
36 volt at 40A = 1440 watt
36 volt at 20A = 720 watt x 2. 

But a more balanced ride.

Doesn't matter how much your battery can give (that only affects torque at high speed), bigger motors with higher settings will always see you an improvement in acceleration from standstill.

However, dual drive is almost twice as expensive, so I recommend single drive for a board you plan on riding on the sidewalk / bike path, where you don't plan to be affected by wheel slippage. On the road however, dual is an absolute must imo.

For a 215 lb person a single 6380 is plenty, if it's a good one like the TB6380.  A Maytech 6374 is barely enough, but it is enough.  For dual, 6354 is plenty

I rode a single drive 6374 10s3p at full setting if I remember correctly it vas a vesc 4.12 so about ~45A

My dual 4.2 6354 flipsky Total 60A . I personally felt better difference in tourqe. And oo breaking was a lot better on dual setup. 

I weight ~ 90Kg

Thank you so much guys i have to think It over becouse i dont want to spend a lot od money, before i was running 213kv 6364 sk3 motor and IT was fast but not that torquey i am using 10s5p battery 50a max but it is set to 37a i think. If i change the motor i would run IT on 45 a probably, and the range is amazing, with 6364motor i could get like 60km

Sorry for spaming but: if i gear it Wright like 16 to 40 or 45 could i get the same torque when using dual setup, and what do you think of overvolting those motors , would it be unefficient?

@b264 has multiple single drive 6380 tb builds and he's 200lb ish .
Think he runs them at 15/40 -15/42 on 110mm wheels. 
Plenty of torque.  Not really high top speed tho.

He uses single 6380 tb motors as his first choice. 

You don't have to change your battery just because of dual drive. Its not a big difference. 
Its probably more efficient on dual because you wont be full Throttle all the time trying to accelerate like you would on single.

3d printed mounts.....
Sounds like a bad idea man.

Correct me if I'm wrong but did you like find some sturdy resilient plastic for your printer?
Will you have some  vibration dampening system that would prevent cracking?

If so I  would also add idlers so you wouldn't have to run tight belts,
because the constant tension on the mount along with one bad bump in the road could cause a  bend or break or crack since we're talking about plastic here.

I believe you are underestimating the amount of stress an esk8 has to deal with.
I've seen some good motor mounts for like 18 bucks each.

shouldn't you be aiming for something over engineered for sturdiness and safety.

In what situations will you be using the E-board and why are you building it?


PS dual 6354 is great .

This seems to be the best as they say bang for the buck.
if you can track him down.

It's hard to recommend motors but it's even harder to recommend cheap ones.
Personally I just wait for hobby king sales and grab some sk3 motors they might not be the most luxurious motors on the market but they pack a punch and should be reliable.

high kv so low low torque with a normal 15/36 config.

And if you're running timing belts I wouldn't go lower than 15t on the motor pulley.

It seems like to have something functional you can only cheap out on some stuff and then you have to build around it.

oooh sorry I totaly forgot what was normal.

I'm actually really sick at the moment But hey you know your stuff :D  :D  :D

Those motors look viable for science, but if two motors go bad that would really be unfortunate.
for single drive I'd say "worth a try" because then you could get something really budget.

Depends. 
What kinda range are you hoping for? 
What kinda speed? 
190kv wil be good at 10s or 12s.
What will fit in your enclosure?

Hey @Skunk, thanks for replying!

I'm looking at getting around 35-40km. I was happy with 10S, but not sure if I need to go higher than 3P to gain that output. I've got a Landyatchz longboard so anything should fit, as long as I buy the right enclosure. This is my first build as well, appreciating the pointers!

🕵👮Go with dual day and night! The total wattage is not the only thing to take in consideration. On a single motor drive, you may still have as much torque as some dual drives but the drag is just terrible. It pans the board sideways (both during acceleration and braking), one of your wheels is always smaller than the others, if your belt snaps, you are basically D E A D, no more brakes (and yes, belts don't last on a single drive), a single motor is more likely to heat up and get beat up quickly. From a stop or low speed, turning while accelerating can make the drive wheel spin free instead of moving the board. Single drive boards also tend to look incomplete with one motor on one side. With dual, you can still ride after one controller fails, one belt breaks...Things to hate about Dual drives: the weight of the board, the cost, and range which isn't always a big deal because surprisingly, dual does not consume twice the single drive consumption. 😎
