Just from the video this new technology looks pretty promising to me, but I dont believe it will come as fast as they say

Looks promising

Wow that does sound good but I bet double the capacity will be double the price! That quick of a charge is sick though quick beer üç∫ and fully charged again!
I wonder what the weight will be in comparison to lithium ion.

I heard about them a few months ago. I hope they succeed.  Release dates are usually delayed/stalled/cancelled

With this things I have a saying if they look like some garage office then it's probably fake. If someone created 2x LiIon wh/kg battery technology big boys would instantly invest money into this.

I doubt that is much good.

I will have to look into it some more when I get home.

I remember something very simlar where General Motors invested some money in a startup company called [Envia](http://www.enviasystems.com/#about) that was also stating 2x li-ion capacity. Problem is that it does not last, something like 400 cycles only and the capacity was already down to 50%.

General Motors engineerers got frustrated as they could not overcome certain fatal flaws of said battery and cut off [funding](http://www.greencarreports.com/news/1089261_collapse-of-battery-startup-envia-what-really-happened).


As another poster said, if startup is small and out of a garage then it is likely bogus, or have severe problems, else the big battery companies would be tripping over each other to fund said batteries.

I don't think it was these guys but a few researchers did do a proof of concept solid state battery that should work with sodium or lithium. 

increased capacity, fast charging, high discharge rates.. all the good stuff... and no more :boom:

basically we can look foward to: 
1: Tesla cells becoming available. 
2: other companies looking to compete with tesla cells.
3: breakthrough tech + waiting for that to go into production and reach end users....

Another promising angle is the use of vanadium in battery packs.
Check out this company:

Unfortunately, so far Mr. Hayek has over-promised and under-delivered. Having George Clooney on the board of directors does not really help.
Nevertheless, maybe within the next years we see something happening

I've been keeping my eye on Lithium and Zinc Air battery's as they have actual proven potential in increased capacity. Also advancements in super capacitor technology is interesting though I haven't seen anything dramatic lately.
