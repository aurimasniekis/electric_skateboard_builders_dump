Electric Skateboard + Fork lift leaking oil + my ass hitting the concrete when I'm carving across the trail of oil (which I didn't see until too late) = damn my ass still hurts a day later :)

Trampa should call it a "Dirt E-Diaper" or "Ass Hat". I like how the grungy looking mountain man in their photos has a Trampa stamp on his lower back. :smile: At least it's removable though.

There's been ass pads for ages! We use them for snowboarding,  im pretty sure they're the same they use for ice hockey.
