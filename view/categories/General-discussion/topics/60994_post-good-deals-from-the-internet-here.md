The best deal in all of Esk8 has to be the popcoa wheels from Ollin Board Co. Might not be on sale, but they're the best bang for the buck wheels. Period. (In my opinion)

Well, you can do whatever baseplate angle you want.  But the real advantage is you are able to get creative with really low baseplate angles to accomodate things like Mountain Board decks with urethane or 6shooters. Thats what I like about them....

I really want a set and maybe a @Kug3lis hanger for SR baseplates..... then do a 12s gear drive Lacroix deck on thane....

I don't think so, and why the hell would you want to?

And where is the Innovator of the Year? @Kug3lis could you make the SR Hanger and would it be "adjustable" enough to put your gear drive in these baseplates with one of your custom hangers?  Thats a loaded question....

I will have to run super low baseplate angels to accomodate the "kicks" of the Lacroix and I don't quite know how these mount. Is it fixed?

My baseplate angels are 20 in the rear and 25 in the front.  

But that leaves me with a 50/55 split overall on the Lacroix with the 30 degree kick angles. 

My concern is that running such low baseplate angles is due to some design element I would not be able to run it for some reasonnor another.

just to be clear what @Sender and I are asking is if you can make a 200mm Surf Rodz TKP hanger and separately make a mount for your gear drive system to fit it like your TB 218 mount does TB 218 hangers.  Is that possible?

What I was telling 100 times 200mm is too small :) You will need like 230 for sure so the idea would be the same hanger as FB230 normal ones but just mounting type and geometry of SR.

Wait you want TKP not RKP? Because adjustable one is RKP if I understood correctly.

Eeee.  I actually want RKPs.... sorry Mike.  But either way TBH.

200 is fine IF the hardware mounts on the outside of the mount.... then you just use linger axels..... 

Have you ever had a set of SR in your hands?

It could be done, it would just take a different design that just requires longer axels.

But why dwell if you can make your own Hangers?

This seems like a good deal, right? Two Flipsky.net FSESC6.6s for the price of one:

Got a 5% discount code after my purchase at SkateHut. Valid until March 31st, one time use. I don't need it because students get 10%  off anyway. :upside_down_face: If someone uses it, let others know. :slight_smile:

Just got these gloves. So far they feel like really good quality and thick. I can use my phone while i'm wearing them. Haven't tested the wind-proof thing yet, but seems promising.

They don't seem to have any palm protectors that slide on the ground; meaning you could break your wrist if you fall. Might be good gloves, but not for esk8 imo.

They don't have any protector.

You can just add your own though

Always better to not give yourself a reason... When my trampa comes I'll gear up to hell and back. It's all about preventative measures

How you achieve that?
My brain wants that as well but my arms don't listen :smirk:

Brazilian jiu jitsu lol. Tons of drilling getting flipped and rolling has kind of been burned into my brain. I either always do a roll out (if possible) or slap out....

Got a Switchblade with the old design that has white paint on the sides as well. Going for a black and white build, similar to this build from @Adstars:
