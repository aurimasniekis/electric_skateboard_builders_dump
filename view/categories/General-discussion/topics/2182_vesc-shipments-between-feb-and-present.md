I ordered a VESC from diyelectricskateboard on February 20th and was wondering when the shipment for the previous batch was.

When I ordered it, it said it would ship around the end of March and early April, but I haven't gotten any notifications about impending shipments, etc. It just states it's on hold.

Also, who maintains what around here? By that I mean online shops such as Enertion and Diyelectricskateboard, etc.

@lilracerboi - PM me with your order number. I received the PCB's but the USB port is actually the incorrect port. Already placed an order for the parts and waiting for them to come.

- Swap out the twisted USB port.
- Connect all the 10awg/XT90 wires.
- Load firmware/bootloader
- Motor detection

Etc.. So I'm working on getting it out ASAP. Shoot me an email so I can checkout your order.

@boards - Sorry for the delay. Had to purchase a few components to replace the parts. I'm looking to get them out ASAP.

Sorry for the mishap. If you can send me your order # that way I know to look out for your order.

Thanks!

@boards - I can be reached on live chat as well as by email. Posting on here won't get you an immediate response all the time. I would recommend using those options in the future.
