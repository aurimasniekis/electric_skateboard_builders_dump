@tueboard I just registered, and then realized that it tracks only Ebike rides which all my rides were tracked as Bicycle so I changed few so if you could rerun import on my profile would be cool  :D

Loving this site for logging. Makes me want to ride longer and faster. Although my mountainboard is not set for speed so going to try being one of those growdups and restrain myself, we‚Äôll see how that goes. Props for the site though üëçüèª
