It is just a rebrand of a commonly used motor...the motor itself should be ok, but this is the frist time I have seen this website...IDK if I would give them my money...Anyway you can get similar motor from many other vendors...

Streetwing seems like a pretty good site. The owner/s? are part of the uk-esk8 Facebook group.

I'm using dual 6355 190kV sensored motors on my build for about a month now. Solid quality, nice performance and really like the stealth look - no stickers & stuff.

David is very helpful, communication is top notch and he ships asap.
Thumbs up!

I noticed that most of the alien power systems 6374 motors say that they are only capable of 10s but most other brands are 12s. Don't know if this is correct or not but that's what the website says

my pleasure @stormboard1 :slight_smile:

business I going great thanks, have some really cool stuff coming soon which I am super excited about but that is a story for another day...
  
all the motors I sell are sensored, they have a keyway rather than flat spot - but you can easily dremmel a flat spot onto the shaft if you wish.
