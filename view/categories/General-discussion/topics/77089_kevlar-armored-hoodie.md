Hello group, I know a lot of people don't like investing in safety gear until after something happens. I read almost daily about spills and looking at pics of road rash body parts and worse. So I contacted this company and purchased a hoodie and had them create a 10% off code "skateboard" for the community. The quality is very nice and I'm happy with the product and thought I would share.  www.gogogearla.com

If you're referencing the first item on that page, you should take that money and invest it into the lazy rolling hoodie, its made for skaters by skaters. Its even got pad inserts!

I dont mean to sabotage your post but I think people should know both exist

If you take the time and read the info on the hoodie, you would learn what it's made with. I am aware of the lazy rolling hoodie "great guys" I met them in Vegas. The product isn't available yet and I'm sure they will post here also when they're ready to launch.
