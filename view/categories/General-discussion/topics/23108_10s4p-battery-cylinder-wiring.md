Hey Guys,

This is slightly off topic but relative to general discussion and electric vehicles in general. So I'm repurposing a few spare ESK8 18650 cells I had laying around into a 10s4p cylinder water bottle pack for my ebike. I bought the enclosure/BMS that looks like this:

Unfortunately there's little to no information on how to tab and wire these things up even in the ES forums. Anyone have experience with this? I drew up a diagram on how I believe the configuration would look based on the three 14 cell battery holders that are stacked on top of each other inside the bottle.

This look correct?
