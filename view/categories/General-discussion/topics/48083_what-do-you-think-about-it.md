I just found [this](https://de.aliexpress.com/store/product/Elektrisches-Skateboard-Lkw-Aluminium-Br-cken-Neue-4-r-der-skateboard-br-cke-lange-bord-lkw/2943263_32851926383.html?spm=a2g0x.12010608.0.0.412c22d3ImjuDx) on Aliexpress and really don't know if it's useful or just stupid.
What do you think?

What?!! Those roller skate boards are such a creative idea! Now I want to see someone ride them. If you didn't know, ["freeline skates" are totally a thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlhUt8AJJO8), I've just never seen an electric version before.
