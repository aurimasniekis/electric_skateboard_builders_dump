I'm deciding between batteries, but Im not even sure how much power will I use, me and the board are around 115kg together, and I ride pretty aggressive on the streets.

I'm thinking around 25wh/km or 40wh/mile maybe :confused:

I am getting around 20-30Wh/km on dual 6384 depending how you ride and hill situation :)

I'm using 8" pneumatic, 130kv dual drive and 1:5.5 gearing and i get around 15-20wh/km. Riding many hills and mostly on paved roads but of course also some grass and rocky paths. 
When i ride full on hard enduro mode in thick mud and forests this value doubles or triples sometimes but i didn't do this lately.

25r

Did we not talk about this :P
25R heats up when run at 20a Samsung Q30 runs at 15a cool and can even do 20a without getting toasty,
and then we talked about 8-10p going for cheaper 10a cells.

I had some unexpected bills, so im on an even smaller budget

30q is too expensive for me on 6p (aiming around 20ah)
25r is a super good deal, and will have a plenty of unused amps on 7p so it wont get hot
Sanyo/panasonic 18650GA cells are also an option but then at 7p I would get only around 55A cont which is IMO too weak for dual 6374

Maybe not? You will hardly hit 60A with 12S and dual 6374! Only when you accelerate hard so i would aim for a 12S7p Sanyo GA pack.

At single 6374 i pull 70a for around 3-4 seconds from a 30q pack
on dual that should be 2x 35a so again 70A but i would not limit the motors at 35a, I would limit them on 60A

Whats the amp draw of a dual 6374 on hard acceleration from standstill
does it max out or maybe around 50 per motor? idk

Im loosing 5ah when choosing a 25r pack but have lots of room for amps, but the GA costs the same and im not so confident its enaugh
