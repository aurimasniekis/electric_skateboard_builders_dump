http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/death-of-frenchman-who-fell-off-electric-skateboard-at-east-coast-was-a

_A 38-year-old chiropractor, who was on his way to East Coast Park from his Tanjong Rhu Road home on an electric skateboard, died after he fell at the Green Connecting Bridge along East Coast Park Service Road near Fort Road. Mr Matthieu Thomas Maugueret, a French national, had got the device four days before the accident._

Not sure if this was posted previously but it's the first time I heard of it. Shout out to @mostwanted for sending this to my attention and for bringing more safety awareness to the Singapore ESK8 FB group. As most of you already know I've been a pretty big proponent for helmet safety ever since my friend's [traumatic brain injury which I explain in detail on this thread](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/why-helmet-safety-has-become-my-1-priority/4288). The death in Singapore is eerily familiar to the way my buddy crashed but luckily he dodged a bullet and is just about fully recovered. Together, we're working on a short documentary about the experience along with pretty graphic footage of the actual crash. The goal is to bring more safety awareness to ESK8 because their seems to some irresponsibility amongst the mainstream companies that de-emphasize the safety factor to mostly inexperienced riders in order to emphasize the "coolness". Remember this Inboard video?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuWvqudOjUw

This thread isn't an attack on any company or specific parts but I feel like Mr. Maugueret's death should hold some meaning for us as ambassadors of ESK8. Like many others here I get asked by random folks to build them a powerful machine. If I can't immediately measure their riding or DIY experience I flat out refuse because it's like a moral obligation to prevent them from hurting themselves. So where do we draw the line? I would guess there's a lot more non skaters/longboarders entering ESK8 than experienced ones.

Here's a few takeaways I got from the article:

_He was not wearing a helmet (back of his head hit the pavement, TBI, never regained  consciousness)_

_He was riding at 11:45pm_

_He was riding an Evolve Carbon 2-in-1_

_Electric skateboards have been ubiquitous on roads in Singapore_

_The skateboard's previous owner had found it hard to execute turns and was also concerned about the absence of a feature to allow sudden braking_

Really sad to hear :cry:

I don't agree that the Evolves are hard to turn, I think their willingness to turn at speed is one of its bigger criticisms. 

I do completely agree that for as fast as the board gets going, the brakes are not a sufficient pairing. 

This story hits especially close to home as I had a very bad fall on an Evolve Carbon. I also smacked my head (no helmet) against the concrete along a bike path. I had hit a patch of sand going around a corner and couldn't save it. Fortunately, I got lucky. I made it with only a trip to urgent care and gluing (liquid stitches) the skin on my head together.

I've had a few close calls as well but since witnessing my friend's accident, I never ride without a helmet - and different helmets for every occasion. Here in Michigan there's a predominant culture of non helmet riding especially amongst bicyclists and motorcyclists. I'll see entire families riding with no helmets and I just shake my head. If I see friends or family casually disregarding safety I speak up about it and never take a passive approach anymore. That's what got my friend hurt and I won't ever let that happen again if I can help it.

This should've never happened. Sincere condoleances.

But to be honest, i was expecting a message like this sooner, seeing all these people go full speed on boosted boards on busy traffic roads without any protective gear (wanting to be like Casey Neistat in NY i guess), i always worry. Accidents only take a split sec to happen if you loose your balance at higher speeds and on a skateboard that means zero control. I've never ridden without a helmet and i'm never going to. If i don't feel like wearing a helmet, i'll take an other type of transportation that day.

OMG, I'm building my first board and this shocks me hard. My praise to the family. Thanks @RunPlayBack for posting this. appreciate the efforts. 
 and I think if u want to make it ur daily commuter, It is not ab what top speed you want, It is ab how easily u can turn (maneuverability i think), and that u can brake in time.

PLEASE, SAFETY FIRST.

Good on you Rik, appreciate your efforts to bring safety awareness to everyone. I used to not wear a helmet when I was riding down the street, luckily I never hurt myself. I always wear a helmet now that I have heard of these things.

We talk abt helmets, pads, gloves and body suits to keep us from harm....

But IMO safety is also abt where, when and who's around us when we ride....

A couple of things I keep in mind when I go for a ride....

Where? On the street to hit the store? Cruising downtown LasVegas? Bike path? I think abt the time I'm riding...and how it relates back to where I'm riding....the time...Soccer mom errand time? Or Had a few drinks after work time....Tourist area? Local street with kids playing and riding bikes? What's there conditions of the road I'll be traveling? Soft shoulder? Homes with desert landscape? Construction area? 

I guess I could go on and on...I think you get the picture 


Aside from all the gear....

Safety is knowing your limits in different environments and traffic situations.

Safety is practicing....practicing to ride in public!...(you know who you are)

Agree 100% on riding defensively everywhere. This might be the New Yorker in us but I'm always assuming every vehicle is actively trying to hit me. I do a lot of sustained eye contact with any vehicle on my shoulder which most of the time puts drivers on alert. I still wave them through even if I have the right of way because I don't trust anyone when I'm riding.

Those are both very sad and unfortunate accidents. Between this and @runplayback's story, the theme is clear; helmets save lives. And conversely, riding without a helmet is not far from playing Russian Roulette. It may sound extreme, but these stories illustrate just how fast your life can be ended or severely altered by not taking a simple precaution. Looking back on my younger days, I had to witness a few non-fatal (but nearly) head injuries due to mountain biking without a helmet, or in one case, wearing a helmet, but not a full face helmet (downhill mtn bike crash @ 30-40mph, instant faceplant due to runoff rut). These experiences somewhat traumatized me into adopting a 100% helmet rule for biking, but still took a few more years before that extended to other activities like snowboarding and skateboarding. Took me slamming into a tree at around 20mph snowboarding, and having to ride out massive speed wobbles at 30-40mph longboarding, to wake me up. I got lucky both times, but learned my lesson, and always wear a helmet now. So, it was a no-brainer when I started eSk8ing. I've actually stepped up to a full face helmet and full knee, elbow & wrist pads, so I can continue to enjoy this hobby as much as possible. But, at the end of the day, all the pads and leathers in the world don't mean shit, if you crack your head open. So, let's all make sure to wear our helmets at a minimum, so when we do end up crashing (it will happen), we can give ourselves the best chance to stay alive to tell about it.
Stay safe & stay smart. :thumbsdown::head_bandage:

For all the years I've been skating/snowboarding, I've only really needed my helmet a handful of times. Thankfully I was wearing my helmet for those few times. Otherwise, I wouldn't be here. You never know when that moment is going to come, and eventually it will.

How is Singapore for E skating?

Are the authorities fining people?

I had a friend who drove down some streets he was not supposed to be driving on and got some large fines in the mail.

Lots of good paved stuff there. 

That guy might have just wiped out on slippery humidity covering a surface. I lived in Thailand for 10 years and sometimes the surfaces would be like very slippery.

I copied and paste all of your advice onto their group page . Unaltered . 
Hopefully everyone wears helmet & safety gears , regardless of electric or non-electric , on boards , scooters , bicycle or unicycle .....or trike .

In the case of eboards , it is unique ! Why ? Because we dont have handle bars to turn side ways like scooters & bicycles .

Not condemning others who dont wear safety gears , i too tends to close one eye when overcome by thrills & spills .

Guilty as charge ; )

Here in Berlin, where I rode for only 3 times since I got my Raptor, I had many talks to interested people.
One of the questions were why Id wear a motorcycle helmet and I always wonder whats wrong with that.
I never felt like there was a better place than on an eskate. Is it too much?
The worst thing is that is a reason to differentiate me from a normal longboard driver and gets attention by the police which will more likely stop and maybe sue me. 
Safety is not what people are aiming at here, rather staying in the old habits

I agree, I think there isn't a clear distinction between a skateboard, longboard and an eboard to the general public. This creates a lot of risk in regards to the level of riding experience and safety knowledge for a new user. Hopping on an eboard and riding in traffic before getting some practice in seems obvious to us but the general public will just make the easy association of eboards to skateboards (a casual recreational activity). Which it is but it's so much more especially when you start getting into more powerful builds which is where all of this seems to be trending towards. As more people get hurt, it will potentially lead to laws and regulations like the way some states require certificates to use Jet Ski's. If you look at Evolve, Boosted, Inboard and Fiik's social feeds, there's a lot of non helmeted riders (particularly with hired models) which only spreads the minimization of safety.

The documentary "[The Crash Reel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fPdzf4j9BNQ)" is very relevant to this conversation. It's about traumatic brain injuries, and the impact that has on peoples lives. The main focus of the documentary is around Kevin Pearce who was an olympic hopeful, but all that changes after he has an accident. The recovery period that he goes through is painful to watch. And, when he announces his return to snowboarding, you can feel his families distress.

Many years ago I had a (minor) accident while snowboarding. Reflecting on that accident after seeing the Crash Reel made me realise that I had a lucky escape and I could have ended up a different person. I've worn a helmet every day since then.

Personally, I think the Crash Reel is mandatory viewing for anyone who gets on a board regardless if it's a longboard, snowboard etc.

i cannot explain how furious i am ........ and i am "in~between" to whom should i be angry to .

in the bicycle market ; theres a spectacle where it has a small rear~view mirror to be attach to the helmet or head cap .

https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Dsporting&field-keywords=Helmet+Mirror+

if the skater had use this rear view mirror . that car would not have destroyed his evolve carbon GT .

https://youtu.be/F1JltzzTluQ

first of all , i my self would NEVER ever ride on tarmac . look in all my youtube videos .
this one ? i just LOVE climbing hills at epic slow speed . i dont know ? 3km/hr ?

https://youtu.be/E2LjlJgMOC0

second of all . i am an experience biker since 18yrs of age . now i am 47 yrs old . 29 yrs motorbike riding experience . bicycle at 10yrs old . 
so with all that experience ? i know that I NEED TO KEEP MY SELF AWAY FROM POTENTIAL DANGERS !
not the OTHER WAY AROUND !  where others have to keep a distance from ME ! ! !!  
IT IS ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS !
i am the smaller vehicle with LESS BLIND SPOTS !???  which gives me the opportunity to keep myself safe . and i choose to close ONE EYE ?  ridiculous !

anyway ..... that car should compensate me if i was the owner of that Evolve Carbon GT ! clearly the car driver saw the potential danger when he actually slowed down but not keeping a safe distance from danger . and he EXACTLY knew when to E~BRAKE (when we all hear the short "screeching braking sound" ) / he knew ! he saw the danger ! AND HE/SHE LITERALLY DID NOT GIVE A COURTESY SHORT HONK TO WARN OTHERS IN ADVANCE !  but he/she kept on going til he/she saw the skater got stuck under the right front tyre ! very smart driver ! dont you think so ? luckily didnt break any small tiny bones at the feet .
no further news of that skater though . just a REGRETFUL LOOK at the end of video . i felt for you bro .
if you (the fatefull *lucky~to~be~alive~with~no~broken~ankle skater)  are reading this ? you should chase the car driver for breaking that piece of now~broken electric longboard . AND DEMAND FULL COMPENSATION FROM HIM OR HER !

thats all i have to say .

I agree I feel your sentiments here. I think every EBoarder should ride on the defensive and be hyper aware. We are not just like cyclists, its something completely different and requires the focus, attention and defensive awareness like riding a moped or other small electric vehicle.

**If you you don't know how to  skateboard, you should not be riding one of these, You will get hurt.** 
Spend six months on a regular board, so you know how to control it properly and in a bad situation, you are able react more effectively.  

**If you ride in traffic on one of these, you're an idiot,**
I've been skateboarding for 30 years, and riding in traffic is a very bad idea. I have done many times, but not anymore.
 **Ride on the sidewalk, there are almost no cars there.**

Have you ever been hit by a car? 
it really hurts.

Skateboarding is very dangerous, **if you ride a board, you will get hurt, that is the cost of admission.**

Should not be able to sell an eboard without a helmet. Maybe we as a community should make it mandatory for every board we make mod or sell on to anyone. A MOU if you like.
More instances like this are not just devastating to the family but damaging to our movement. 
We should lead governance, not react to it.

Registered just to respond to leroy.  I've only been hit by a car 1 time on an electric skateboard.  I was riding on the sidewalk.  Cars don't see you and are more likely to pull out in front of you.  I thought, "I'm going 10mph and on the sidewalk.  I don't need a helmet."  She hit me pulling out of lowes, damaged my first board, an ego, and broke my phone screen that was in my pocket.  I bought a gt and now ride on the road, unless i'm willing to walk on the sidewalk.  Riding eboards on the sidewalk in Las Vegas is illegal!  I wouldn't ride on a road with cars going 50 miles per hour, without a bike lane.  Having cars whizzing by you like that is crazy.  I would ride on a road with a 35 speed limit though.  Don't assume that you are safe on sidewalks.  You aren't safe anywhere.  Wear a helmet, and if you are on the road and their isn't a huge shoulder, take the whole lane.  E Boards are more difficult to control in a straight line than bikes.  Cars will ride up within a foot of your board or bike and if you hit the wrong bump or need to swerve, you will get hit.  Take the lane and always check behind you.  Either that, or ride on sidewalks and walk across all intersections, because they will not see you and they will run you over.

@Justin, my son and I used to watch Casey's videos and thats where we got the idea of building our own Eboard. Being from NY and now living in Tampa, FL. its better here to ride an eboard, much safer. I used to watch Casey and sometimes wondered if he was going to crash into a car or a car hitting him, always riding without a helmet and Casey going through red lights.

very smart words , I agree in full ! And I don't understand why someone is not using a Helmet and the protection .... maybe those looking for more kick or I dont know  - or they want to challenge Darwins Law.

please dont get me wrong, every injury that can not recover with permanent pain and limitation - is sad and unnecessary ! 
Any fatality  caused by doing something with passion and joy - is one fatality to much - statement in my view 

But basic safety gear wearing from us adults can make a statement to kids to stay safe and to show them our life is something worth protect - and having more fun !

HELMETS for E Boards, NOT riding in traffic, learn and know your limits..., ride responsible - Have fun

Yeah this is old news, but just 1 or 2 weeks ago another Esk8-er in Singapore that I recently met fell on the back of his head badly while carving. Thankfully he was wearing a full faced helmet (which broke on impact).

He basically lost memory of everything that happened that night but thankfully it's likely he will ride again.

Wear a helmet guys...

 And safety is still and always relevant - do you agree ?

I posted some new thoughts and ( please consider New comers, reading this esk8 builder forum first time!) 
I stand up for my post big time .
 Maybe not relevant for you - fine with me. Just saying " Darwins Law exist "
