I bought a battery from @SFJerryTW and it’s really bad build, I don’t know if I can rebuild it ? What do you guys think ? 
Good thing I caught it because it would of burn the house
I turned it on and it started spark ![image|375x500](upload://taNhXGiVQTau5sgV2QyAzf0KucC.jpeg)![image|375x500](upload://vFoazWdza6VsiXqIiW7tECq9KbB.jpeg)![image|375x500](upload://lelLoMvU7Nk3RMR7Z77RCj0c0iW.jpeg)![image|375x500](upload://rvnS7HdamWYo0AyYY3qckyJBbmc.jpeg)![image|375x500](upload://yL5fFBk8EDehT19V9A4784CdE53.jpeg)![image|375x500](upload://wdzvk2kezDb6ZrsxSPE23miORu9.jpeg)

Damn! What cekls are those? Is that silvertape? Doesn't work well with heat.. And no cardboard/fishpaper on positiv terminals..

Have you contacted the seller?
If so, what was his response (if you received one to begin with)?

Shit. Disassemble that pack asap and start to check each cell IR, voltage etc.
I would not leave that pack unsupervised

How manny amps are you pulling ? This battery cant handle high current, with only one thin layer Nickel metal, in the serie connections. I think thats why the melting corners. This battery gets hot. Poorly build battery

@moderators  there should be a rule that if you sell a battery you have to post pictures of the build
Because this is really dangerous

I tend to get more annoyed when people KNOW they should be doing something but they really cannot be bothered doing it properly - and here we have the award for 'most half assed fish paper usage in battery 2018'

Did that guy use a torch for soldering? That looks terrible!, 
- Use fishpaper & Kapton tape
- Solder the balance wires on a narrow nickel tab between the cells (preferable on the negative part of the cell)

The current contineuos draw is 60A on the LG hg2 with 3p. I have the same exact setup and it works well with one strip at 0.15x10mm. You have to consider that the strip has two dimensions that matter when designing for current , thickness and width.

Overall I have to agree that the assembled pack looks very sketchy..

I use this chart, made of a person who knows what he is takling about.  Now i know why so many have a lot of voltage sag. Nickel 10mm 0.15mm can't handle that much of a current. The series connections is critical, because the total amount of current is going to float there. So you are feading 10mm 0.15mm with 60 Amp ? OMG

For burst 15amp is okay. And thats why 10mmx0.15 is perfect for the parallel connections,  But 60amp..... Naah
My next battery is going to be with copper sheet for the serie connections, and Nickel only for parallel

Concerning the series connections:

I like to support the welded Nickel with soldered copper braid for rigid batteries and 12awg silicone cable for flex. No direct soldering to the cells and the conductivity is SOLID.

![IMG_20180629_115022|666x500](upload://3p9u8qf6d6LfDZvFFis7LSyvOXP.jpg)

@willumpie82 I agree with what you say but if you solder onto the negative pole, you don't need to put fishpaper underneath. The nickel flag and the battery body have the same polarity. That's the whole point of always welding it onto a negative terminal.

Don't do that! Just because it works for now doesn't mean it doesn't get crazy hot when you speed uphill. You can't know the temperature under load.

That being said, I think many people heavily overestimate what they actually continuously draw from a battery. If anyone thinks they are getting 60A continuous without a heavy guy gunning uphill on huge motors, please show me the logs. Bursts aren't a big deal. Everything that lasts less than a few sec doesn't really count for conductivity calculations.
Just my $0.02 as ppl say

Sure. If you run 60 amps 100% of your ride. I'm berly ever hitting the 60A so maybe..1% of my total ride is at any critical limit?... When i desigin ICs, which i do for a living. I usually go by 1u/mA as upper treshold. (yes micrometer..)

That braid looks like a decent solution to support the nickel strips w.r.t. power

I don't put fish paper on the negative terminals underneath the spot weld, only at places where i think vibration might damage the battery heat shrink (hence the tabs, also isolates a bit from the heat when soldering the balance leads, but mostly just a force of habit ;)

I'm not sure If i missinterpretend something here. But do you mean the series bridge between the parallell Groups? Or only whats welded on the actual + and - terminals. working and discussing simultaniously here so might have skimmread bit too much.

We can do that, but people are already required to post pictures of whatever they’re selling. I’m curious as to why you didn’t ask for pictures of the build process?

How someone can make this? And worse, sell it

Is these kind of behavior that make the board go boom and the whole community get a negative image, like happened to hoverboards

On the good side, this is a perfect example of how you should not build a battery

He even sent me pics of the build which I didn’t really appreciate before, but it’s a nice comfort having visual proof the pack is assembled correctly. I’m sure @barajabali would send pics as well if I had asked.
