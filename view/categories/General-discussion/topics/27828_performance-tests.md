I've seen lots of back and forth about comparing boards and whose is faster, bigger, better- drag race challenges, Pike''s Peak hill climbs. But there doesn't seem to be any standard performance tests that settle the arguments. I tried posting a similar thread on Reddit but didn't get much traction, so I thought i'd give it another shot here.

So what are the right tests that you would like to see as a common measuring stick for performance? I see a couple of different categories:
1) Board based performance- these tests would be purely to evaluate one particular board versus another in key performance areas. To do this, you would need some specific parameters (like a set combined weight of rider and board) that everyone agrees to and documents as part of their test.
2) Board and rider performance- Whether it's horse racing or stock cars, there is no denying that a skilled driver makes all the difference in the world when it comes to top performance. Combine the right rider with the right board and the results can be off the charts. These tests would measure the combination of the right machine with the right rider to set records.

So what tests do you think would be most important? There are a few that I can think of and some that were suggested in the other thread. Here are a few:
1) Acceleration:
100 meter dash- Fastest over 100 meters (Is push starting allowed or should it be from a dead stop?)
1/4 mile sprint- Similar to a standard car drag race. Same question about push starts though it has less impact at this distance
Time to a certain speed (25 mph?)- sort of like 0-60 being the standard measure for car acceleration

2) Top Speed:
Top Peak Speed over a set distance (1 mile?)
1 mile Challenge- timed 1 mile race (use GPS and sea level measurements to control for flat race route)

3) Endurance
Distance traveled on a single charge
24 hours of Esk8- Most miles traveled in 24 hours with recharges and/or battery swaps allowed

4) Braking
Distance to stop from 20mph

5) Hill Climbing
Really not sure how you could standardize a hill climb test unless you picked 1 particular hill...but that limits people to have to travel to one particular place to test. Maybe a set incline over a set distance?

What does everyone else think? Other overall categories that you would suggest? Any other tests within a category? I think if enough people are into keeping records, it would be cool to have a stock, modified, and custom classes for these tests, too. Having some standard tests would help to end some of the debates about hub vs belt or brand x vs brand y. And would give lots of riders a chance at glory :v:

Here's what I think. 

Whoever you are, whatever you're slinging. If your board doesn't feel like this board:
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/3/5/350ad2e2ec25df1d616cb0d3ae5bb5bdaedd9b89.jpg" width="690" height="388">

It probably pretty much sucks. Braking it down further:
Motor mounts,belts and motors can be placed on this board without affecting how it feels.

Um...ok. I'm not slinging anything. Just tired of watching everyone pull out their dicks and no one's got a ruler. And I'm not a big fan of those drop through decks. I prefer the top mounts like this.

But hey, ride what makes you happy. Just don't tell me yours is the best unless you can measure it.

First..That's not a drop through deck, its also a top mount.

My point is everyone's got a favorite ride. Taking good parts off to make shitty parts fit doesn't make your same favorite board as a result. 

Anybody can make a 40mph board. Anybody can make a board get 20 miles of range. Anybody can hide all of their shit in the wheel, or deck. 

But at the end of the day, if your deck is still a foot off the ground because you get wheelbite it doesnt matter if your electronics are in the deck.

Or if your motor has replaced half of the good cushy urethane just to make it fit, but it feels like crap on anything less than smooth asphalt..or worse your urethane has a hard time staying on your hub because it doesn't have a functional core. what is really the point?

I personally ride because it's fun - because my boards feel good - because my boards are still longboards.

Still don't see what that has to do with my first post. I'm talking about coming up with common tests that everyone uses as a measure of performance. Instead of everyone yammering about how their board is the best, I'd like to see someone show that their board is the fastest over 1/4 mile and post video to prove it. Then anyone else can go out and try to perform the same test faster with whatever their setup is. I'm not trying to push one type of board over another.

I used to be big into the Mopar scene and we all knew who had the fastest Challenger around because there was proof over a set 1/4 mile race. We don't have that for esk8 and I'd like to see us develop one within the community.

The purpose of objective performance testing is not about anything else except objective data from very a specific set of testing criteria. Is this useful for the consumer? not sure? doesn't mean the need to test things is invalid.


**Which one of these is the fastest around a circuit?** The F1 car wins this performance test because it is better at braking & cornering when compared to the Drag car.

**Which one of these is fastest in a straight line?** The drag car Wins, it is faster in a straight line but sucks at cornering.


**They both suck if you want to pickup the kids from school.**

Define the test, using Observable, measurable, objective criteria, then see what is better at that specific test.

It's very simple. Did X do Y better than Z

A mixed test with a variety of every day challenges are probably more useful to the average consumer.

Right? We're doing too much arguing here lately..Feel it? I do.

Here's the simplest test we can all do whether we have ridden a longboard or built a few or not.

Ask yourselves this one question.

Could I enjoy riding this board unpowered? Your answer is important.

The testing that @NummThumz is referring to would be considered quantitative analysis - collecting objective data using standardized tests. The data is typically presented as figures and numerical data points. The interpretation of it is minimal and the goal is to be able to make comparisons across a number of "subjects." In this case - esk8s!

The attributes that @psychotiller describes would be measured using qualitative analysis - interviews, surveys, focus groups, and observations to determine what matters to a population of people about a subject. This kind of research usually precedes quantitative studies, because there's no point in measuring something if the measurement can't help us all in some way.

The current thinking is that good scientiific research uses each side to triangulate the other - this approach is called a "mixed methods" approach. Both have an important place. Rather than contradict each other, the two sides inform each other.

Nerding things up a bit :slight_smile:

I'm doing a quantitative study but some early discussions with my committee revolved around whether I should do mixed methods or not. Luckily it did not happen because time is not your friend when analyzing qualitative data.

I own a DIY that is much faster, accelerates much faster and has more than double the range compared to a Boosted Board, however I rode a Boosted for a couple of days and it is just as much fun to ride if not more because it carves so nicely and the flex of the deck really makes it comfortable.

So @psychotiller is right that specs do not completely reveal how good a board is, however I agree with @NummThumz too that if you're going to talk specs they should at least adhere to some conventions.

If the specs are reliable you can get a good impression of the performance of the board, the riding quality can be somewhat estimated based on the configuration of deck, trucks and wheels, but the best thing is of course to try one!

Side topic - Im waiting for the moment when esk8 races might become more popular.. Im already seeing some good progress from what French / Germans are organizing. 

At least I know that each year in Germany they have this All terrain electric mountainboard race and I think France is not that far behind with something like this, as there seems to be many riders by now too.

As a side topic.. Evolve had its already 3rd? championship.. I think the idea is not that bad but I assume to 'save' personal finances of many people, the events would need to be local but maybe some sort of 'standard'' could be developed so the best lap times / max speed and so on could be comparable?

This also comes to the power output of the boards too maybe.. though I think for beginning just a fun ride together with others would be enough but later on it could develop in some more serious races where the specs of boards are more controlled (?)

I'm excited for this as well. I think there is huge potential here.  Electric skateboard racing would be a much better "spectator sport" than downhill racing.  High speeds in a confined area with faster acceleration

That's a good idea. How prevalent are dynos for eskate? Seems like a pretty specific item that not many people would have. And if it's anything like the car market, all sorts of gamesmanship can be played with dynos. Do a quick google search on whether a cold air intake has performance increases on a Dodge Charger and you will see all sorts of arguments about who was using this dyno or that dyno. What the heat was on that day, etc.
Unless it is an independent party doing dyno tests across multiple boards, I don't know if this could be standard.

Me too! There is a whole topic starting on the sister board electic-skateboard.club on racing. I think the hardest thing to overcome will be traveling with the boards. You can't just jump on a plane with one. So my bet is most of the early racing will need to be local circuits drawing on the population that can drive to the race.

Here's the thread I mentioned: https://www.electric-skateboard.club/t/esk8-racing-whos-out-there/74/5

Regarding the dyno there are some instructables on putting together small dynos for testing small motors, not sure if there is one that would hit the sweet spot for the kinds of motors we typically use.  Did some searching around but couldn't find prices on prebuilt dynos that are really made for this sized motor (found some for smaller or bigger but not the middle ground for these motors).

How about a figure 8 time attack challenge to test acceleration, braking, and turning? This could be a test with 2 cones a set distance apart (50m? 100m?). Do 10 figure 8's as fast as possible. It combines left and right turns with acceleration and braking. A lot of this would depend on the skill of the rider, but the performance and ride-ability of the board would also be key factors. 

They do a lot of these time attack challenges in drifting. Could work for esk8, too. I'm really trying to think of challenges that people could do anywhere with a board and a camera.

This sounds good for the mostly qualitative tests (and test of skill), think it's always good to have a standard tool for doing any of the quantitative measurements though really (gotta take the human factor and other environmental effects out as much as possible).

Something like this might work but probably not cheap (just checked $500-$1000, nice looking test rig though):

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDfVvS9io3o

Maybe someone can come up with a relatively cheap/safe rig for doing the torque testing too (have it lift a weight tied to a rope or something of that nature, time to lift 10lbs 10ft or some other easy to find metric equivalent that would work given the torque and power of the motor we typically use).

The figure 8 is the only test I personally see as having any relevance in rating e-boards. Reason: You can't inflate or lie about the boards capabilities. The only variable is the rider. So get a better rider if you don't like your stats.

Distance? Not sure I've ever read an honest stat. How many boosted riders are getting 6 miles?

Distance should be a pretty easy one to track assuming you have unbiased third parties doing the testing, any GPS tracking app or even the timeline built into Google Maps can give you a total distance and average speed (could also use the metr.at data gathering and overlays as well to show the live power usage).

Biggest problems I see with distance measurements done in the real world is the elevation changes and the differences in road surface in different places (could just use a standard high school track but sure they use different materials and techniques to lay those down depending on where you are so would be hard to compare numbers remotely).

Dyno can give you relative information about the range but of course doesn't account for wind resistance and fighting hills and all (unless it has a dynamically controlled brake in the dyno as well).

I think distance on a single charge could have some min/max parameters. For example, you have to include GPS coordinates and can't travel a route that is ever more than +/- 100 ft from your starting elevation above sea level. There could be some strategy in picking the right type of route. You can be certain that the automakers have this down to a science when they test their cars for MPG. 

I don't know what strategy would work to create the best distance- very controlled and flat environment (like a local high school track)? using a slow eco mode approach? Getting up to top speed as quickly as possible and then holding a tuck for the majority of the ride? Heck, someone may even lie down on their board to reduce wind resistance. I have no idea what would work best, but it would be fun seeing some of the videos to capture the title.

You don't set up tests to suit certain riders. This isn't elementary school where everyone gets a participation award...You set up a course and some shine and some don't. If someone's board can't make a turn what should they do? Go race on a different course? Build a better board. The idea should be to showcase boards that have the ability to perform well in all conditions.

Turn radius
Braking
Top speed
Acceleration
Stability at speed
Varied terrain stabilty (rumble strip/bumps, speed bumps, gutter/curb hop?)
Weight
Distance per charge
Hill climb


These should be the benchmarks.

Correct. But I'm saying that longer boards will take longer to turn as a direct consequence of being longer.  

Turning Radius also has a huge number of variables...that you'd want to adjust for. Even trying to get something as simple as max turn angle on a 150lbs rider will vary greatly with different duros.   
  
Motorcycles have similar issues and they just don't list line by line metrics like you're trying to list.

What you have devised is more a test of riders than their boards.  
  
For this to be useful data it has to be repeatable. 

Like if I was going to make a test for turning radius for an entire board I'd standardize duro on the wheels/bushings then put a 150lbs block on the board and move it around to get a certain lean angle... Lets say 5% and measure the radius of a full circle then I'd continue moving the block to it's max lean angle and measure the radius again.

There won't be a single test that will have all of the answers. The key is to design a few that we think hit on key components of an effective esk8. While a longer board may give you difficulties taking a turn, it may also give you an advantage of stability in the straights and increased acceleration. Rider skill will definitely play a role, but isn't that the case in most performance tests? When someone[ sets the record at Nurburgring](http://www.autoexpress.co.uk/best-cars/86123/fastest-nurburgring-lap-times-2017-quickest-cars-and-lap-records), it's still about the car.

If anything, this will put esk8 riders with skill in greater demand from the board producers. They will want the right person riding their product for these types of tests.

How so? You specifically outlined why a longer wheelbase wouldn't do as well as a shorter one? Did you take into consideration different truck set ups? Both are board specific qualities, not rider. Designing different challenges based on different board dynamics would leave everyone in the same spot they are now. With absolutely no idea how their board really compares to others. The standard should be a specific type of course that has dimensions and traits that are adhered to. Layout could be done in any parking lot with measuring tapes and cones.

The only rider specific demands with a figure eight is that you would have to be able to do frontside and backside turns/slides equally. It would be equally fair for goofy or regular riders. Where is the problem with that?

All other statistics collected on runs would be build related. If your gear limits your ability to run the course you would then have solid data when comparing your build to someone else's.  Am I missing something?

Because more than just that effects turning radius. A single example will be heavier rider will be able to compress bushings and wheels more giving him a higher turning angle. 
  
A rider with more confidence will lean more giving a higher turning angle.  
  
And the list goes on...    
  
Do a bit of research on it. A figure 8 (or the box) is actually used in motorcycle licensing as a final test of skill.

How about you stop focusing on rider weight and ability? This thread is about build capabilities. I.E. The sum of all parts and their performance. That has been what is in question and you keep trying to introduce variables that always begin with "rider". 

If you want races to focus on rider abilities we will only need one board.

And I've had a motorcycle license since 1987 so just stop...

Because the rider is the biggest variable. A good test controls for variables. A good test is repeatable. I add 12 drops of chemical X into the solution and if the solution is acidic it turns pink.  
  
The biggest variable is people. If you're going to crowd source this then someone will have to curate the data. As people are going to put it fake data and bad data. A small group of vetted riders would be best to gather this data.
