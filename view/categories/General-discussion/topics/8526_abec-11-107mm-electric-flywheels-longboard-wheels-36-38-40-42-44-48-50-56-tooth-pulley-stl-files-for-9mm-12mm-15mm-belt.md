For those who've been following the other ABEC Flywheels and Clones thread, you'll know there was a team effort on trying to figure out the dimension of the 107 flywheel and between some information from @sl33py (27mm depth) and a bunch of photos with rulers everywhere for reference from @caustin we managed to make a pulley, probably more luck than anything else really given the circumstances. caustin was kind enough to be the guinea pig for these and they have his seal of approval.  So here's the last of the mass uploads. I already had pictures for these ready and I'm including caustin's pictures and video as well so enjoy. For the record, these 107 wheels are massive. They make 50T pullies look tiny. They look about the same as my 36T pulley looks on my Kegels. Thats bonkers.

What it looks like when not on a wheel. (pretty odd looking if you ask me)

So sweet!  Can't wait to print and test fit one!  Thanks for getting these done!

I see you included 9, 12, and 15mm width - @JuniorPotato93 - you are A W E S O M E ! ! !   Thanks and anyone who prints these should throw a few $ his way (link to contribute/donate on thingiverse).  I'll send some $ your way for all the help!

Made a video featuring these pulleys (MBS and Abec11 107mm):
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9mac4UA4Zc

My 107mm wheels are from the first generation and contanct patch (CP) is 62mm, but this don't affect the pulleys, they do fit.
The second generation is shown above, they have 74a and 58CP print on them, mine don't.

Thanks for sharing this awesome work. I found a 3D hub near my town, they can work with PLA/PHA, do you think it'll hold the abuse of an e-board?

I'm not familiar with PHA,  but others have had success with PLA.

Looks like PLA/PHA is a tougher PLA blend so you should be good.

Yeah PLA/PHA is tougher and less brittle and PLA, it has a small level of flex so it should hold much better

Do you guys have a preferred online printer?

I went to 3dhub and found a 3D printer 3 miles away from my house, the price was ok, so I went ahead and ordered the 44T pulley.

@JuniorPotato93 I can't thank you enough for sharing this awesome work with the community, I'll let you know if they'll fit fine on the ABEC 11.

BTW how many teeth had the yellow pulley? it looks really big almost the size of the 107 flywheels

@Eboostin I suggest you do the same instead of ordering online, shipping would be more expensive than the pulley itself anf you could pick it up yourself

Anyone have a clean and easy way of removing the support material on the teeth? I find it to be a pain in the arse.

Bridging between the teeth can be done without support as it's such a small distance. The hexagonal cut outs are also printable without support though the first few layers will be a little aesthetically messed up but that's okay,  structurally they're sound.  

That way there's no support removal needed

[/quote]

According to the Electric Skateboard Calculator I need 16 teeth motorcdrive and 44 teeth wheel drive to run Abec 11 107mm Electric Flywheels thar'll give me 35-38km/hr and max acceleration combo at 70% of efficiency.

According to my calculations I'll need a 280-285mm belt to run these pulley set with the Torque Boards motor mounts, can someone help me with this?

I haven't finished my build with the 107mm Wheels but with the 100mm MBS-Wheels I use 48-50t pulleys because I don't need speed over 30 km/h and realy like the torque uphill. Imaging climbing this incline with 107mm ABECs must be awesome:

Could you share the files not as STL File, but as STEP (or Volume CAD File) as well?
This would help a lot, as I try to use these wheels in a super powerful application! We got a planned 10 kW per wheel, so I have to put some bearing in to the pulley as well :slight_smile:

Aand the wheel as well, that would be great. I will share the files back here for sure!
