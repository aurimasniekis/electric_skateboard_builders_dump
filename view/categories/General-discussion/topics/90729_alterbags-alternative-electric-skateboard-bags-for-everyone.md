Hi guys, Ken from Alterbags here. 

This pretty much began as a small project to develop a robust and functional bag for carrying electric skateboards, especially when we spend our entire day out and about and mall grabbing our rides is just simply uncomfortable for an extended period of time. There simply weren't many viable options available back when we started working on this last year.

On 12th April 2019, our first line of bags, the Native Backpacks, were launched on our website shipping worldwide. We received tremendous support not only from the local eskate community here in Singapore but also from international eskaters. 

Our initial batch of bags have since been sold out and have been shipped to our customers. 

We are now accepting pre-orders now for our next batch and will be offering it at the same early bird promotion until the end of April 2019.

Estimated ship date to be by late August 2019!

Do stay tuned on our social media channels and website for more news on future availability as well as more specifications, features of our bags and also the different boards that we tested our bags on.

I just got mine last week and i gotta say, the bag is good stuff! I got the mini, and it can fit long decks like my Prism origin V1 and a double stack enclosure, and a jet spud single stack. If you have a wide deck like the Lacroix you'll probably have to get the Maxi. Thanks Ken once again!

We didn't managed to try it out unfortunately. But I dont see an issue as long as the deck width remains below 11inches.

I second this. @Grievor can the board be mounted with the wheels facing outward? This is will be far more comfortable for people with big AT wheels.

Here are some pictures tested with an evolve carbon GT and a Lacroix.

No bindings on both, although I do think the bindings might get in the way as sufficient clearance between them is needed for a good fit with the bag. Would have test this out to know for sure.

Yeah, that's to be expected, you kind of have to have a flat surface to do this properly. Oh well, I guess you can't have everything. Either the bindings will get you or the wheels will.

Which size would you recommend for a 29" jetspud with trampa trucks? It feels like it's right on the line between the two sizes.

I would recommend the Native Mini for that.

The only real difference between the two is the size of the bag? Or is the frame larger too?
```

## \#19 Posted by: Grievor Posted at: 2019-04-21T01:17:55.845Z Reads: 153

Frame is larger as well. The Maxi fits widths up to 11 inches and the Mini 10 inches

One of our early bird customers from California just received his Native Maxi Backpack.

Works wonderfully with the Backfire G2S.

Thanks, you should really add something like that to your website. Is the side where it gets strapped on stiff? Is it comfortable enough for hiking?
```

You can see it under the getting started page, link [here](https://www.alterbags.com/getting-started).
The back panel is slightly flexible and with the outer portion lined with padded cushions. As for weather it is comfortable enough for hiking, I wouldn't say so when compared to my hiking backpacks (i have an osprey and a lowepro) because it wasn't designed to be as such, but it's comfortable enough to be used as an everyday backpack especially while carrying your electric skateboard.

Thanks, must have overlooked this page :) Right now I'm using a Tatonka backpackless frame but these are definitely lighter and might be a good option :)

Looking good, @okp! How long does it take to strap in? Was wondering if this would be more practical than just carrying a heavy board while shopping in a small convenience store.

Got our hands on a Backfire Ranger X1. Weighing in at 13kg, it is one of the heaviest boards we tested so far on our backpacks!

I‚Äôll be honest, I really want this product and I am someone who shells out quite a bit of cash on esk8 (at least $5k last 2 years) and I am having a tough time justifying the $125 price tag. If it were $100 you would have me sold.

I understand it‚Äôs hard to lower prices on new products and I‚Äôm not saying you should just for me. Just trying to provide insight from a potential customers in the future if you ever are able to lower your price point.

If you do a Black Friday sale or something, I‚Äôm sold!

Not trying to flex, just trying to give him an idea of how much I spend to show I am someone who is willing to shell out cash for quality products while still saying $125 for a backpack is a little more than I am willing to spend.

Also a lot of that expense was tools as well. I basically started with a crappy tool kit I got for Christmas. Those shitty hex wrenches stripped a lot of bolts...
