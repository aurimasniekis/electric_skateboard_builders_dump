I am going to buy Samsung 30Q in coming days.
I have searched for real vs fake reference none of them has latest information. Since its very common cell to people around here ; you guys can help me/ others to distinguish between real vs fake.

I would usually buy and test cells myself. But I have to pay almost 2.5 times the average price of cells and I have been saving money from long time, it would be great if someone from forum could provide some images of genuine cells with verification points on cells.

Thanks.

I think buying from reputable vendors will be the easiest way to ensure they are real.

I am not sure what your best option is for India but someone might have some insight for you here.

I would buy from trusted vendors from the forum here. But none of them ship to India those who do gets ceased by customs. I found one supplier and will be buying from him. He is a trusted seller (by many people i asked) still I am just having second thoughts on spending money

He'll run in to the same issue. I'm well aware of this nonsense @vishal_tejwani I lived most of my life in a country with strange import rules.

It's hard for people living in free trade markets to grasp the idea that your goods can be seized and usually destroyed regardless of availability. Some close minded rule sets just don't work, this is a good example.

Is there an esk8 community in India? Surely with the vast size of the country and the emerging classes there must be people riding over there? Perhaps they can give you some advice.

His batteries are seized at customs and destroyed because India want's him to buy them internally to grow GDP. His consumer rights are literally non existent.

Couple of visual checks you can do

1) All samsung cells have 3 prong tops 
see https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0674/3651/files/fake_18650_topcap_compare_1024x1024.jpg?6017021717417048144

2) Font 
The "3" should be asymmetrical. The top of the three should be flat while the bottom half curves. The "D" should not have any portrusions behind the vertical line.
Bottom cell is the fake 
https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HWKjS80fkS0/maxresdefault.jpg

3) Underside markings on the cathode. The pvc on real cells should be somewhat transparent and allow you to see some markings. Fake cells either dont have transparent pvc, or no markings at all.

These little visual checks only help, cells can still be fake. Coming from a sneakerhead background, I can tell you china can make fakes look more real than the legit. The only way to be sure is to get access to an electronic load and match discharge with the specs on cell datasheet.

correct right?

also the text inside the wrap is visible or it is necessary to remove the wrap and check.

I can test them, but I haven't bought them yet and 10cells is minimum quantity. Which is expensive for me to buy just for testing as i am getting them at 2.5times the average price.

Honestly I think it's pretty hard to say either way. I buy from IMR here in the states. I don't deal with anyone for cells overseas. The key is to find a trusted source and stick with them.

There are fakes out there. Some of them look exactly like the genuine cells. the only way to know for sure is to test them. Calculate your risks.

Everything seems to check out visually. I'd say theres a good chance they're the real deal but like psychotiller said, the only way to be sure is to do a discharge test. 

On a side note, it seems that from the packaging, your supplier sources their cells from efest in china. They have a good transaction level on alibaba for 7-8 years.

I think a charge test is easier n more valid!  U can correlate it to charge testing at different currents already done  A discharge test, unless controlled environment, you’d be all over w discharge current.

I just use a icharger 406duo that can discharge and show the amount of mAh pulled and then I charge it back up again and see how much it can put on. Might be special things to get it more accurate but I don’t think this is far off.

The thing is that not only the capacity is the thing you should test. Even more important is that the cells can handle the current you want to get out of them. If you get a fake cell with the same capacity like the original one but can handle only 10% of the max discharge current than the original thsn it’s a kind a problem...this you can’t measure with a balance charger.
```

## \#36 Posted by: Minim Posted at: 2018-10-10T20:01:14.327Z Reads: 132

Max discharge power capacity: 140W (Channel 80W)
Max regenerative discharge power capacity: 1400W (Channel 1000W)
Max extra discharge power capacity: 2000W (Channel 1000W @25V/40A)

I’ve never tested to discharge at high current but it doesn’t look like a problem to do 10A discharge on this charger. It’s a beast!
```

## \#37 Posted by: cryo Posted at: 2018-10-10T20:34:37.547Z Reads: 124

i think a 10a discharge current is enough to test a 30q. according to datasheet at 10a a typical 30q should give 2945mah so if u get that much it should be fine no?
```

---
## \#39 Posted by: Minim Posted at: 2018-10-10T20:53:51.396Z Reads: 124

```
Then the icharger should be enough. Single cell it can discharge 80w and that’s like 25A/4volt. Might be an amp limit and not only a watt limit. Will test it in a few days and see how it works. 

If I understand correctly you can use a big empty Lipo and charge that while discharging a cell and put 1000Watt out as discharge when charging the Lipo. Never tested this tho..

At what cutoff voltage is those numbers?

Thanks everyone for help. Cells were genuine bought them made a 10s2p pack. Its charging currently while it was on 20% it wasn't saging 1v drop was observed.


Thanks everyone again for inputs and pictures.

Ive just opened my battery from a cheap but well known brand board. It has poorly faked batteries in that barely get me 7 miles. Some others have started to look inside and found the same fake cells. This goes deep even in branded products. Maybe they dont know themselves and just shovel the sheet on to the consumer ![20191123_163036|374x500](upload://nljXfNT0Pch1qsXwKf5ED6C2wMA.jpeg)

(after a reasonably quick search) 

I cant find anything that ever hinted at a 30q wrap with a rounded 3, very odd that its here...

Like Hummie said you cant know just by looking, but it certainly makes my sketch-ometer go to a 10 :man_shrugging:

My main doubts started when i got 6 miles before low battery warning. Also when attached to the 2 amp charger the voltage rose instantly, or at least faster than id expect for true 30q cells. Also it charged in around 2 hours not around 3 as id expect.

Anyway as mentioned on this very page people have been finding out the traits of cells tested to be fake and mine have them. All of them.

The other guy was only getting 5 miles and also found the same mis printed cells as mine.

The name of the fake battery is jingnoo new energy. Id guess all boards using this is fake. It seems to be mostly the smaller 2p packs of ownboard backfire and even meepo show this brand on their pictures of replacement packs.

Ive just ordered a meepo mini 2er with 21700 cells so fingers crossed they are ok as the packs are made by someone else

Flat top and round top 3s, both completely discharged at 15a continuous on my new battery tester, results were nearly exactly the same. Temp not much over 40 degrees C, and very close to 3000mah, one a little over, one a little under, less than 20mah between them.

I was suspicious at first, the supplier said that different factories have different prints. But the tester doesnt lie 🤷‍♂️

Mine is getting worse each ride lol. It says 4.5ah during charge on my wattmeter but its a bit optimistic by 5 percent and not all that energy gets into the cells im guessing. Thats a fair way off 6ah after a handful of rides. They are trying to say i get 7miles/4.5ah as im too fat and go too fast (80kg and 15mph average). Makes total sense.

Im sure theres 20 different fake 30q cells. Some closer to the mark than others. I have genuine 30q cells in an acebeam x80gt 32.5000 lumen at 20 amp bursts per cell and havnt noticed degradation at all in 16 months use.

We are sending the backfire ones to a guy at Fogstar who is going to do some tests and graphs
