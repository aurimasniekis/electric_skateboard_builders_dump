Enertion have the worst support and business practices i have ever seen.

They will give out one date (knowing they are unable to meet the date) to get orders.
As soon as they have your money you will get nothing but the guys in the support chat taking the mick and telling you estimates are only estimates.

Take today for example 

The FOCBOX is now not going to be delivered till May-June and they ahve a big sale to celebrate all the customers who have been expecting their orders in April (as they were promised by Enertion)
