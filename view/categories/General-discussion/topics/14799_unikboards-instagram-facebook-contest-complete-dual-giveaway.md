Hey there ! 

@JLabs thanks for the warm welcome. I always strive for integrity in life and this also applies when I'm building DIY electric skateboards. Michael is not paid for that (I don't know him personally); and I thank him to have forwarded this to support us. 

I have been developing the project from scratch 9 months ago in my apartment. Worked hard to make this possible with little if no budget. So I'm really proud and that's why with my friend we are giving away a dual mount. Of course, it will help the community to know us... but the winner will get the mount for sure!

I do ride a lot, post a lot of video content but I stay true to my roots. The stuff we sell are rock solid, just check how hard I ride jumping with bindings.

Happy riding folks and show some love !

Haha I wasn't being serious. Michael and I have a good relationship, and I bust on him sometimes.

I also added the jk to the bottom just to clarify for any readers that didn't sense my sarcasm.

We have a winner ! here's a sneak peek of the draw. it was 0Â°C outside but we made it. This is the first giveaway of a series and I'm really happy that many people have joined the party. Really happy for him to have a blast on this. 

I'll post the full video of the draw tomorrow 12AM CET. Enjoy !!! No editing was done, so it's a fair giveaway, especially because I don't even know most of the people out there. 

That's my way to say "Hello"; bear in mind that we have just started this company, so your support is welcome !

That's so cool man. Thank you. Keep up the good work and great presence here on the forum. The pics and videos are great. It's nothing but snow here right now, but I will build something cool from this. I've been searching for a new deck already in the 36-38" area.

Awesome speed on the shipping. Can you pm me what you paid in shipping? Or post here if you feel like it. If I knew I could get parts shipped fast for a reasonable price it would make buying from Europe way more practical. I'm gonna build something great with this prize. Cheers CÃ©dric
