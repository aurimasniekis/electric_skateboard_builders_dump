Its also rechargeable, which in my opinion would be annoying to keep track of.

Shredlights is 3d printed rubber for the housing. I bought an ekicktech one of their first ones but it eventually fell apart.

The bike light on ebay, thin horizontal one for $10 bucks is a better buy.

what would be cool is if there was a set of lights with an accelerometer that could feel if you were turning left or right to apply a signal. and to know when you are slowing down to apply a brake light.

I just planned to build such a light on my own but at this moment i dont have time for that:

Using such a [light](http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/__72893__Powerful_Searchlight_with_Built_In_Pan_Tilt_and_Remote_Light_Mode_Switching.html) and connect it to a mini adruino with [accelerometer](http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/__103402__Keyes_Wearable_ADXL335_3_Axis_Accelerometer_Module.html).
```
