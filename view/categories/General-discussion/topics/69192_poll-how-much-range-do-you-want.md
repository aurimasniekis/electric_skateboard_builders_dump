Given the popularity of larger battery packs, here’s a poll to see what everyone wants in a battery.  If you prefer multiple boards with different ranges, select multiple ranges.

Pick the ranges you most prefer your batteries to have:

[poll type=multiple min=1 max=11 public=true]
* <10 km (<6 mi)
* 0-10 km (0-6 mi)
* 10-20 km (6-12 mi)
* 20-30 km (12-19 mi)
* 30-40 km (19-25 mi)
* 40-50 km (25-31 mi)
* 50-60 km (31-37 mi)
* 60-70 km (37-44 mi)
* 70-160 km (37-99 mi)
* 160-320km (99-199 mi)
* 320km + (200mi +)
[/poll]
```

To me if an electric skateboard has less than 12 effective kilometers of range it's kinda useless,
If I want something portable I will use a push-board.

10 miles isn't quite enough to get me across town and back, plus if I need to do it more than once per charge. 30+ does that with room to spare.

Really depends on the build. Most of my builds are either 20-30km or 30-40km. Most off boards have lower range even with a huge battery pack.

...but is also really heavy.  Which is exactly why I prefer both, depending on where I'm going or if one of them has a dead battery already...
