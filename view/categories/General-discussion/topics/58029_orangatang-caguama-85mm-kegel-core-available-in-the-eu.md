83 Euros

Who said size doesn't matter?

> These wheels are designed for speed, grip, and an ultra-smooth ride.  Additionally, it's actually designed for the rigors of e-boarding (It's the same core as the Kegel so it'll fit many of the belt drive e-board systems out there).

I’m upset there was no 85mm when I had a boosted. The v2 was my first ever electric skateboard (actually first skateboard!)

Agreed. I’ve yet to experience or even hear about a esk8 company making wheels as good Otang or Abec 11. If Loaded was smart, they’d just make their own esk8. Hire @whitepony as a consultant and make some sick shit!
