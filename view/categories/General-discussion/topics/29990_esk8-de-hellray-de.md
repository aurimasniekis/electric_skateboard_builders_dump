Hi!

Exactly a week ago I placed an order for a complete DIY board at esk8.de which seems to be same as hellray.de. I chose to pay via bank transfer. After I paid on Tuesday I haven´t heard anything from them, I´ve made several attempts contacting them via Email and PM here. NO ANSWERS since last Monday. 

How are your former experiences with esk8.de? 

Kind regards

Joel Lindgren

Don't worry, be happy!
You've chosen the right place to order bro. I've ordered 3 times until now and I am happy with esk8.de. It depends on your order how long it takes for an answer and then shipping. For example for esk8 controller they need 3-5 days for quality checks and testing. In your case it's a complete board so it might take a bit longer. Their quality is top, it is worth to wait a bit. Hope you'll get it soon!

Don´t worry you´re safe.
If you haven´t heard from Attila till then, he is on holiday with family or something else. I´m sure he´ll be back soon.
He´s doing that beside his job.

I've only had good luck with esk8.de.  Anything i've ordered from them i usually have gotten in a week here in the US.  Dude always does what he says he's going to do.  Real stand up guy.
