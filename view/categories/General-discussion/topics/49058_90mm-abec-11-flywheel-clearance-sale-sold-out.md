Hey, just wanted to let you know, [Ollinboard](http://www.ollinboardcompany.com/product/90-mm-abec-flywheels-liquid-rkp-trucks) is selling a set of Liquid Attack RKP trucks and a set of 90mm Abec 11 Flwyeels together for $75.95 + shipping for a total of $89.60. Now, I don't know about you, but that seems like a pretty damn good deal, if you need a set of trucks for whatever reason.

Don't know if anyone else posted this yet. If so, delete this post.

Buck Trucks I didnt even know those were still being made The must be cleaning out there closest.  The attack trucks are really nice I have a set and they come with 3 different bushings per truck so you could play with different set ups.
