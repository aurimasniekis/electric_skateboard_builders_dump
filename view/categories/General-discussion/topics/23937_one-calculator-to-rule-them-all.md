Its been a while since I did anything to my website, mostly it was just for my portfolio to brush up on web stuff.
but I feel like making something useful.

<s>I already did a basic [speed](http://esk8.today/2017/01/03/how-fast/#more-365) and [range](http://esk8.today/2016/12/28/how-far-can-i-ride/#rc) calculators.</s>
Edit: these are offically obsolete! please use [calc.esk8.today](http://calc.esk8.today/) for both speed and range. 

These were just using a basic plugin, I want to make a new one from scratch, probably with bootstrap and some js or something. But the question is of course, what does the perfect esk8 calculator need?

Ideas:
----------
1. Speed
2. Range
3. Hill grade
4. Compare
5. Save/download/upload config
6. Price compare(eventually)
7. Board Weight esimate?

Obviously you are the ones using it! so what do you think?

Cool! It seems like we have a lot of calculators for stuff like top speed and range. I'd like to see one that can give you rough estimates of performance.

Something where you could input your max volts/amps, rider weight, frontal surface area, hill grade, etc and it would show you power output, potential 0-60 times, hill climbing capability, torque output etc.

I have no idea how feasible that would be but I think it'd be super useful.

nice tool @saul

I think u should get some more publicity  with this.. :D so yeh gonna post here.

 I really like the calc esk8 style and simplicity, if yours could be made in similar way (for range) that would be great.. otherwise a bit hard to get where to get what or maybe it was just me who didnt get the whole page loaded with all the numbers and fields at the first shot.

Some of this would be possible but I need more torque curve data for various motors. I know there are some for sk3s from the group buy. 

Till someone makes a dyno it'll be difficult to have real comparisons.

I'll play with some math and see what I can do quickly with minimal input first.

Thanks, the current one was tossed together in an hour or so.

For this one I'll give a dedicated page, clean mobile friendly layout. I saw the code for calc.esk8.it is on GitHub, need to check the licence and maybe I'll learn some Ruby to build off that, not sure yet.

Basic template is up. <s>its non functional, but</s> it should give an idea of what it will look like and how it will work.

Battery section is working.
<s>logic is done, just need to add fields so should have range and speed in a bit!</s>

Update: Speed and Range work!

can u ask @lox897 to pin it? Otherwise im afraid we gonna loose this one in all the other threads.. if there is a special category for tutorials, that would be nice and then maybe it could be moved there ? (though i think there is no such category yet - for tuts)

As about the site itself:

The Capacity info does not seem right. can you just make the page to 'average'' / round the number to 2 digits behind the comma?

Also - make an option to chooce mountainboard or longboard.

The speed data looks very okay! It even says: Estimated Energy consumtion.. but I think it did not work for me :\ as the range numbers stayed the same..

Otherwise - very nice work, easy way to calculate watt hours for the pack now :)

## \#16 Posted by: saul Posted at: 2017-05-30T02:40:05.862Z Reads: 265

I fixed the round error. 

for the energy use, you have to enter you average. 18 is what i've been getting for single drives.
and I think about 25-30 for dual.

If you can give an estimate for mtb, I can add a dropdown option, like on battery type.
I think 30-40 whr/mile?

just take your battery capacity and divide by average range per charge.

[/quote]

I was just thinking of that! I think max cont Amps per cell, peak amps, C rating charge/discharge for lipo.

from this I can add max power, charge time, pack amps....not sure what else?

yeh charge time feature would be really sweet! I used to have it on one of those RC calcs but then the calc crashed and I had to do it on my own each time :D

though.. i usually just charge Amp hours now, thats how I know how many kilometers I can do / need to do.

for Hillclimb/Torque and Weight you can use this experimental calculator or maybe adapt some of the formulas to include in your calculator

Colors are okay! I would advise to 'make a space'' / seperation between the long column.

After Total battery energy or after range fields, perhaps there should be a seperate blank spot then continue the column further.. i hope u get what i mean by this :)

Or make it 'hidden''so that user has to click on it to reveal the info

Tabs - Power, Capacity, Range, Power output, Charging time

Motor / esc rpm speed, eboard speed

[/quote]

i'll try to add in a simple/advanced version soon.

for now I added a basic hill grade estimate using the calculations shown [here](https://engineering.stackexchange.com/questions/6756/calculating-torque-needed-to-climb-a-graded-hill).
keep in mind this is only based on rider/board weight and **continuous power** since I can't find enough info on torque of 50mm motors. and in most cases (not hubs) the torque multiplier of 2-4x from the belt/chain/gear drive gives a surplus of torque as long as you can put out enough power!!

basically it give the max hill grade you can go up at full speed with give cont. power.

[/quote]

its the average energy use that I get for my single drive yes.
I sugguest you find you own avg.
How to:

Enter your info on the calc. note down 
Total Battery Energy:	185.00 Watt-Hours (W-hr)
Then do a full battery drain on a ride.
lets say you got 10 miles. 
then 185/10 = 18.5 w-hr per mile.
or for dual would be around 8 miles?
so 185/8 = 23.1 w-hr / mile.

i would guess around 20. but no higher than 25 (dual drive avg)... and you will may end up with a few extra miles depending on the batt...

Had to work out a few bugs...mostly i just never liked web programming. 
but 
(EDIT): it works, but shareable is slower because it needs to reload the page, for now.
so the main page is the quick version,
Shareable at http://calc.esk8.today/config/

But is the "Max % Hill Grade" right? on the advanced calc. Maybe i put in something wrong, but i got around 70-90 % hill climb. Am i reading it wrong? I tryed my board in a few different hills and it cant do all of them.
