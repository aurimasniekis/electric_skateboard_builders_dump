Hi guys,

I'm looking to do my first build by modifying my Razor x electric skateboard. 
I love the ride on this thing but its just too slow for me. I feel like I have all of the parts down except for the gear and pully kit. Does anyone know which kit would fit these wheels?

Any help would be greatly appreciated:)

Thanks to [a67676767](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/u/a67676767) for the pictures.

Maybe kegel core would fit in those circular slots but that a an odd wheel. It's a razor wheel then right?
