I am making my first esk8 and before jumping the gun and buying all the parts I found I whould like to have a second pair of eyes to look over it.
I want to achieve a decent range of 21+km with a top speed of 30mh/h (may be lower) while having a smooth ride in a country without any hills. My budget is an absulte maximum of 1200$ and this includes the cost for a soldering iron, multimeter, wires/connectors and balance charger.

I am looking at:
* Motor: https://street-wing.com/product/6374-190-kv-sealed-motor-with-sensor/
* Battery 4x https://hobbyking.com/en_us/zippy-flightmax-5000mah-4s1p-30c-with-xt90.html fora 8s2p system
* BMS http://www.batterysupports.com/28v-29v-30v-60a-8x-36v-8s-lithium-ion-lipo-battery-bms-pcm-pcb-p-264.html
* VESC https://flipsky.net/collections/electronic-products/products/torque-esc-vesc-%C2%AE-bldc-electronic-speed-controller
* Deck https://www.sickboards.nl/nl/longboards/19509-hammond-b-40-dropthrough-complete.html
* Trucks https://www.sickboards.nl/en/reversed-kingpin/6101-caliber-ii-forty-four-10-trucks.html
* Wheels https://www.sickboards.nl/en/wheels/4737-orangatang-kegel-80mm-wheels.html#/47-color-blue
* Bearings https://www.sickboards.nl/en/bearings/3824-zealous-bearings.html
* Drive system https://www.unikboards.com/en/boutique/smart-single-kit-unik/
* Remote https://street-wing.com/product/mini-trigger-remote/
* Enclosure will be decided on a later point.

I will use a push button with a 150ohm resistor as an antipark before I put in my key and will use a 50A fuse.


If I'm overlooking something or have made a mistake (Probably in the board and drive system since I'm not that good with that material yet) let me know.

All looks good. Remember to add an enclosure and safety gear: full face helmet, knee/elbow pads,etc.
If you want to save some ðŸ’°, you can get the mini remote on eBay for half the price & get a KEDA 6364 (although street wing maytech is the best).

20km+ range could be a problem.

That's kinda what i was thinking. 8s10Ah is 296 watt hours so at 16 watt hours per km your getting under 20 km but if you average something more efficient say 10 watt hours per km then you can get almost 30. It just all depends on the rider and environment.

I live in the north of the netherland and the rides that I will do will not have any inclination this makes me think that the times that I ride (not high winds) will have a high efficiency.

are your roads good enough? Sure to go for 80mm wheels?

I'm averaging 10wh per km btw but it all really depends on how I'm riding.
I'm in Netherlands too

There is only 300m of some uneven road, the rest is nice bike paths or good asphalt

You can save some money buy getting the drive train from http://electricboardsolutions.com (possibly other stuff too, not sure), and skatehut.co.uk has Kegels and Caguamas on sale.

Big mistake. I thought the same when building my first board, and ended up riding with duct-tape holding everything together for months because not only could I not find a cheap enclosure, but when I finally did it took _ages_ to ship. For my brother's build I chose a deck with an integrated enclosure because I can't be bothered :smiley:

I just finished ordering all the parts for that build (single drive 10s4p), total came in at around 1100â‚¬ , here's a rough price and parts breakdown if you're interested:
[details="Parts"]
* 68.40â‚¬ E-Caliber trucks from unikboards (48â‚¬ + 20.40â‚¬ shipping)
* 172.50â‚¬ MOV-E deck
* 20â‚¬ Nano X remote from Enertion bought way back
* 92.60â‚¬ TorqueBoards VESC bought from the forum
* 15.18 GBP 2 belts from beltingonline.com
* 71.90$ Ollin Popoca wheels (35.95$ + 35.95$ shipping)
* 43.8â‚¬ Push to start switch w/ antispark from Sprusi (39â‚¬ + 4.80â‚¬ shipping)

From ebay:
* 7â‚¬ red led ring light
* 5.5GBP white led ring light
* 4â‚¬ 12V converter

From electricboardsolutions:
* 5.99â‚¬ griptape
* 12.99â‚¬ berrings
* 3.95â‚¬ spacers and speedrings
* 3.99â‚¬ VESC sensor adapter
* 24.95â‚¬ Riptide tunnel riser
* 7.99â‚¬ motor pulley
* 29.99â‚¬ Caliber motor mount
* 359.00â‚¬ 10s4p battery with charge only BMS
* 39.95â‚¬ aluminam kegel pulley with integrated bearing
* 7.98â‚¬ riser pads
* 95â‚¬ 6374 170kv sealed and sensored, repaired Maytech motor
[/details]

Good luck! :slight_smile:

I will look at the drive train tommorow, and probably the other stuff that website has. As for the enclosure, I do not want lipos taht close to a surface going 20km/h so I will promise you and myself that I won't install any parts till I have that, it's just a problem that I'm not that confident in knowing how much space I will need for all the parts, and how that all will fit under the board (maybe 2 boxes with a bus inbetween).

Consider 2x [5S 8000 mAh](https://hobbyking.com/en_us/zippy-flightmax-8000mah-5s1p-30c-xt90.html) as an alternative. It's 296 Wh, exactly the same as 8s2p 5000 mAh. The price is similar and wiring it up would be much less of a hassle.

If you do go with 8S, a balance charger instead of a BMS is worth considering. For 8S, relatively cheap balance chargers can be found, but not for 10S.

I'd like to charge with just a plug and have my cells balanced at all times for safety since breaking is regenerative too. As for a separate charger I can get an 6s charger (since my cells are 4s) for cheap but if you can recommend an 8s charger send me a link.
As for the 5S option, it doesn't look that good to me, I will get a lower top speed while it is more expensive.and for the wires I will make a PCB for better cable management.

Obviously you would make 10s1p, not 5s2p. :smile: So it would actually give you higher top speed.

There's absolutely no need to balance cells while riding.

How will that work? Will you take the battery pack apart anytime you'll want to charge it?

I decided to go with the 2x 5S 8000mAh since it will make my build better. My board will have a plug to charge the battery's without taking them out but I will get a 6S charger just incase.
