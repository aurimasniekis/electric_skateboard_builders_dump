I have an enertion motor mount and pulley kit that I bought 2 years ago and I am have almost finished my board. The problem i have is that I bought a turnigy sk3 5065 280kv motor and the shaft is too small for the pulley and the mounting holes are not wide enough apart. The problem gets harder with my battery being a 7s2p as most motors start at 8s. 

So do you have any recommendations on what motor to get. The build is only mono drive and its a small board so I am only looking for 15 mph tops. 

Would the 6354 260kv turnigy sk3 motor work even though it is rated for 8-10s? 

Thanks in advance.

That motor would be perfect even with the 7s2p setup. Enertion motor mounts are for 63mm motors. The 50 you got is too small for the mounts.

You can drill new motor mount holes in the motor plate maybe?  Im not sure which motor mount you got.

The carbon fibre one. So not really the bet idea to drill holes in. Thanks for the reply though.
