Since I finished my board, I ride about 3-5x a week, weather permitting. I ride for about 10-15mins and get in about 2 miles. I get a rush every time. Never gets old! I live in a suburban area and ride around the neighborhoods. Hopefully I don’t get bored of the route. 

Post how often, how long, and how many miles you ride. Also post what areas of town you ride in.

About once every 1 - 5 hours, 7 days a week, rain or shine

Usually before work, on lunch, after work, then a few times in the evening, and multiple times all weekend but if the weather is bad I stay in more often on the weekend.  On weekdays, it's riding whether rain, snow, or sun all the same.

Usually most trips are <3 miles but a lot of them are 4 - 10 and occasionally a monster 15-20 mile ride

The grocery store I usually go to is 3.8 miles away, probably go twice a week on average.  IKEA is 3.5 miles away, I get coffee beans there

About 15 km a day + 20-40 km group rides per week. Going to double that soon once my new board is finished. Still get a rush after several years riding 👌

I ride usually 2-3 times a week during school, and once or twice a day in holidays. I usually go for a 3.5km ride along the bike track and through some new fancy estates as the roads are butter smooth.

I also hope I don’t get bored of this route as it’s a very nice one

daily coffee runs diagonally across the street, I take the long way there, which is just 0.5 miles.
2 weekend morning 10 mile rides are a must because the rest of the weekend is taken up by entertaining my daughter.

Now that is finally cooler, I go night riding when the family goes to bed

Because I commute every day, I've been averaging around 800-900 miles a month. I know, ha. These boards are like robot drug dealers. 

To be fair, this one of my daily commute routes, one way:

I used to ride about 8 miles each day after work (or more if I commuted with the board) and ~20 each day on the weekend. I always tried to skate each day.

Now it's cold/rainy out and gets dark at 5:00, so until I get my lights working again, dry weekends are the only time I've been going out. And it's been raining every weekend for the past month, so... Not a whole lot of skating lately. Hope to change that soon and I'm ready for Spring.

Other than before switching phones, minus the few times I don't connect VESC Monitor, that is exactly how often, and items per folder is how many times that day. Average of 10-20 miles per ride, anywhere from 30 minutes to 2 hours.

I have a backpack with 3 cloth shopping bags, one of them insulated.  Just be mindful of what you buy.  No more than 24 cans of beverage, 36 if you want a dead arm by the time you get home.  Preferably 12 each time.  Anything else really doesn't matter.

Combination of putting it in the backpack and carrying a few bags with my front arm it's never been a problem.  I mean, you carry them from the car to your house, right?  Now instead of going in your house, skate down the street.  Same thing.

Sure, that seems like a pretty good system. The difference is even though I do the "carry all the groceries in one trip or bust." Those would not be viable on a skateboard or for longer than 2 minutes. Do you also carry your skateboard inside the stores with you? I know that is a yes for you but what are the logistics behind that as well? Grocery store seems easy, just put it in your shopping cart. What about other places where that isn't possible?

Yea, I didn't know that. I don't know a lot of things pertaining to eskate, which is precisely why I joined this forum. :wink:

So restaurants can just be propped up with you at your table I suppose. Stores where you wouldn't have a cart? I dunno. I'm just trying to get an idea overall on the minor things you would have to do when you don't have a car to depend on. What about a gym? Can't really fit it in a locker, so I guess you would have to find other accommodations. I'm just genuinely curious because I've actually been thinking about stuff like this throughout the day sometimes. I know with your builds, the weather is a big part of how you go about them and I'm sure the range is another factor. Is weight a priority when designing these things too, since you got to keep them with you for the most part?

I'm sure it's leg day, but I can't say how much it would work on cardio or upper body as much.

That makes sense, having multiple boards would make that burden easier. To stay on topic I will state I ride none. My current average is about 0.

Luckily my board fits perfectly in the lockers at the hospital where I'm at. 

If it wouldn't I have no idea how I'd be able to use it as my commute.

I've actually seen a nurse on a (non-electrified) longboard in the underground culverts going from one part of the hospital to another. 😁

It's funny because I almost never go to the one downtown because it's too close :rofl:

I’ve ridden to both the gym and grocery store which are less than a mile away. When going to the grocery store I only go for small items and if it’s full on grocery shopping I take the car lol. I store the deck in the shopping cart. When I go to the gym, I store the board in the locker.

So do you guys ride on the sidewalks? cause I hate it.

I usually ride in the roadway, but nothing is off-limits depending on the circumstances.  Sidewalk, grass, indoors, roadway...pick up the board and jaywalk through a red light ;-P

You can't get a [meaningful] ticket for walking through a red light.  Ha ha

I use mine for getting to stores a lot too and usually have a bike lock on my backpack so I can just lock the board to a bike rack (I specifically drilled a big ass *objectively ugly, but functional* hole in the center of my board) for looping the cable lock through.  My board looks DIY enough that I think it would scare most common folk off anyway, but I've never had problems with it being messed with in a few years of doing that at a couple grocery stores and convenience shops (for quick runs in I'll just leave it leaning near a garbage can in front of the store where I can see it but it isn't drawing a lot of attention).

---

Regarding original question of how often, it varies some based on the weather... nicer it is more I use the board and just find reasons to go out and cruise, but still use it in crap weather to get places I need/want to be if it's close enough to not justify getting an uber or finding some other way (grocery store for example is only a few blocks ride so I still use it to go there as long as there isn't snow on the streets).

3 miles every day of the week and then some more for groceries and pickups. So > 100 per month.

I try to stick to bike only lanes whenever possible. Speed is limited to 16mph for safety, because it is easy to miss things at night.

I ride when i can.  which ends up being 1-2 times a week.

I work from home or go to clients for meetings and that is usually further than the board can take me.

Broken wrist from not paying attention so I have been told by the wife that I can't ride till the cast is off.  hanging for the 2nd of January.

I ride everyday it doesn't rain. Hot or cold. I live about 4 miles from my job so about 8 miles a day to and from work and in the spring/summer/fall 4x as much. There's a grocery store and beer distributor across the street from me. When I grab a 12 pack I place it between my feet. When food shopping I fit a case of water. I get asked all the time why I just don't drive to work and I try to explain to people how much fun this shit is.

I ride from home to work from Monday to Saturday **5 miles**

I come home to have lunch on my house round trip  (when my GF is willing to cook) **10 miles**

If she does not want to cook, I lunch in any nearby restaurant, lots of good ones around, at USD 5.00 with entry course, main dish and dessert **3 miles**

I go to nearby businesses and convenience store several times during the day in the smallest board I have available **2 miles**

I come back home at night **5 miles**

3 times a week my friends and I get together in a restaurant to have dinner, usually a Chinese or Japanese **6-8 miles**

I never use my eboards for leisure or anything ther than main transport, but I enjoy it more than anything in the world

I don't ride very much lately usually once or twice on the weekends. I live kinda rural but with quiet some fast traffic that It's frightening me (since skates and esk8 are not common arround here) espacially right now when it's dark from 4:30 pm til 8:30 am, I know I would make some people kinda uncertain riding seeing some guy riding towards you with such an vehicle. 
As electric skateboards are illegal where I live I want to avoid to get to much attention, "a fast wierd guy on a board in the dark" is a bit to memorable for me .
It's also slippery and muddy everywhere right now because it's raining every day for the last weeks at maybe 3°C or below. Which sucks when I can't see all that much.

I live 5 miles from work but the 3 roads there are 55 mph, 45 mph, and 55 mph so I can't bring myself to try riding to work. My old board's battery is shit so no riding for me unless it's taxi'ing on my golf cart. Waiting on my new motor mounts to get back to it! What an esk8 Christmas it shall be.

They beep angrily and try to push your feet back into 'equilibrium', at least thats what my ninebot does :man_shrugging:

The most important thing is to listen to it.... otherwise everything goes south very fast

Yes, that's exactly what happens when limitations hit on this ninebot z10. I don't know how the speed limitation implements itself because i haven't topped it out, it probably just won't go any faster, but when the battery dies, it beeps and slows you down and won't let you get anywhere, and if you get off of it right then, you'll probably still be able to walk it to your car or house with the luggage handle before it shuts off completely and becomes 60 pounds of dead weight. I had to drag it almost a mile after it cut out from a dead battery. No bueno.

This crawl should have it's own name worthy of the crippling social stigma that comes with it. 

There's nothing sadder than a manchild in full safety gear absolutely shredding it at 4mph in the final stretch home. 

I usually just carry mine home rather than face the disapproving and disappointed jeers of the local children.  Maybe I'm just projecting here.

Omg, I'm dying. :rofl: I think we've all been there. We'll, at least those of us that get all geared up to shred.
