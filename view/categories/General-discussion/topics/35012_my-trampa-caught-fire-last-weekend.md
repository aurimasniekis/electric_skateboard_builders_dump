I've been building eboards for almost 2 years now, the level of dedication I put each one is crazy, a lot of effort and time, the quality of the workmanship had also been increasing on every new build, so I can say I'm no newbie but neither an expert, obliously.

I was riding my Trampa Street Carver this weekend and after riding through a brick road I started hearing sparks on my board, I was able to brake normally, remote command were still working, stepped down the board to see this horrible scene:

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/5/a/5ac54b432c5ff7e5868dd675e43636dd9b6125da.jpg" width="666" height="500">

I'm really glad it didn't happen on my 16th floor apartment with my baby sleeping next door or at my work with a lot of expensive cars around, fortunately nobody got injured and no property was dammaged, it happened on a bike path downtown, I even got help from the some City Hall officers 

Nevertheless, I feel bummed and really sad. The level or impotence watching your board burn while there's nothing you can do to stop, it's just too much for your feelings, like watching a puppy crying for help and all you can do is watch him die slowly. 

I'm still trying to figure out what the hell happened, I've been runing this board for 5 months 7 days a week.

I was hesitant to post this on a public forum  as don't want to be the guy responsible to banning the circulation of our beloved boards on public places, but most important I think we should all be aware of the dangers of batteries and learn from my experience to try to minimize this possibility to all you brothers. 

The board was freaking bengala, I though lithium ion batteries were safer than lipos but when something goes wrong, these energy containers burn like gunpowder.

The aftermath

Btw my eboard didn't have a fuse, I'm going to put one on all my boards, not sure it could have prevent it though

This is how I remember you, my most beloved eboard... RIP

Are those bulletconnectors from the on/off switch soldered to the batteries? I've just started my first battery build but I would not want that kind of weight weighing down on just a solder.

I've shorted those balance leads and they fuse out. 

if any cell in the pack shorted and started thermal runaway it would potentially heat the adjacent cell, cause venting, whose gases are highly flammable.

Sorry for your lost, I felt so sad just by looking at those pics. As I experienced this in my first build when one of my screw punctured one of my lipo pack. And whoops $300 down to the drain, but mine is way less than your lost. Hope you will get better and come back with another awesome build.

That really sucks, but glad nobody was hurt. Yikes! She was a beauty. 

If I were to venture a guess at the cause, I'd think that maybe the thick, main wires crossing over the flex sections, that connect the batteries in different compartments to each other, slowly had the insulation worn through from the deck flexing against them, and eventually shorted. To me, it looks like there isn't much space between the deck and the flex sections of the enclosure for those thick wires to pass through without getting pinched. If that were the case, the constant deck flex could repeatedly smash the wires until three insulation wire off. I wouldn't think a balance lead shorting would be the culprit since the tiny wire would just vaporize itself, which I've accidentally done on one of my Lipo packs, and sort of act like it's own fuse. But if those main connecting wires had the insulation worn through and shorted, they could sustain some serious current for long enough to start that fire. That might explain the sparking sounds after riding over the bricks as the exposed wires finally shifted enough to cause intermittent shorting to start the chain reaction. 

On another note, between the cracking Trampa trucks, and at least two crispy BBQ Esk8's, just in this thread alone, I'm starting to think that those MBS all terrain wheels might be cursed. :skull_crossbones: Call me superstitious, but I'm gonna go take those wheels off my boards before something evil happens. :japanese_goblin: :laughing:

Besides the helmet, protection pads, truck tool, maybe some spare belts, always carry a fire extinguisher when rinding your electric longboard.

[/quote]

If this happens then there would be no short between then, they run the same polarity so that might not be the culprit, but I'm guessing that it could be the balancing wires

That could really be the cause, those wires were flexing along with the thick wires, if one of those worn our until they were exposed that could have vaporized in one second with even low current, so in this case not even a fuse could have saved the board from caching fire. 

I'm thinking about removing the BMS on my next build it has been a proven to be more problem than a fix, at least on flexible packs.

Btw I've been riding my Trampa with no BMS for the past 4 months and the packs were perfectly balanced

It happened on one of our builds too! I think the common denominator is the flexy deck. The flex joints on the batteries won't last forever. Even soft silicon wires break down from movement. I agree with @scepterr on the location of the problem. And once the short was there the other cells would have been effected as well. We had the same result. Nothing left to inspect..

Sorry for your loss!

It's glass fiber or some other non conductive material. I probed all the holes in the deck to make sure it was non conductive. (Not on this deck, but another trampa deck)

I think when there is an internal short in the battery neither a fuse nor a BMS could help. They would cut off the vescs but in case of fire this makes no difference.

 I think @scepterr is right on this, 
[quote="scepterr, post:6, topic:35012"]

[/quote]

the balance leads maybe got cut and shorted the hole thing, also in the future when working on this U configuration it is good to have a separator layer between the 2 row, I use silicone to make it one piece, alone the highlight lines, this way there is no rubbing of the cells.

Also connector soldered directly to the battery is a big NO NO, this connectors hold too much heat during the soldering process and once attached to the battery will dump all that heat into the cell, most likely killing it.

This isolator are no good, because in the event of a short the glue will caught on fire and burn the isolator pad of the battery and then the poles are just expose, leading to a serious short. 

Man this is sad but luckily no bigger damage.

i soldered my first battery pack straight to cell (160+ joints!) with no issues. If you check the datasheets for these cells, they test them to pretty extreme temperatures. I doubt soldering directly to the cell would cause any issues.

Also, I've shorted balance leads before and since the wire is thin, it should fuse out and disintegrate. Even my 10mm nickel strip disintegrated when i shorted it once.

It'll likely be impossible to tell exactly what caused this fire, but should be a good reminder to be as safe as possible when constructing these lithium packs and insulate, insulate, insulate!

ouch, sorry for the loss. I wanted to make a flexy Trampa board as well. Maybe the flex is an issue? Was there room between the wires and bottom of the deck? Maybe the compression, vibration and rubbing caused the short.

I used those isolators in all other builds and never caused any issues, I remove the battery enclosure several times prior this incident, at least 20 times, the insultators, wires connecting the packs, nickel strips were always perfect, no pack was bad or unbalanced ever, this was a pretty good looking job.

I wouldn't like to start causing doubts to all innocent components, I'm pretty sure the issue was wires vaporizing and igniting the fire, later they melted the silicone isolation and shorted the batteries.

For me, no more BMSs on flexible packs or maybe use conformal coating on the balance wires

Those strips were later replaced with dual 16AWG wires, so they did not protrude as shown in the pictures.

This is not the original battery but the job was the same:

Hey man, sorry about your board.

It really sucks when something like this happens, but i hope it inspires you to make your next build even better. Your trucks and motors are probably still salvageable, it's a good conversation starter for me when I tell people that my motors survived a fire.

I wold check those red cables once. Because when you solder them they lose lots of it's flexibility. Because of bending one of them cold have losen up, and shorted out somewhere.  Just an idea. Other cause could also be is that there was as a bad cell.

Sorry about your board, great loss but at least it was material loss only.

Let this be a reminder for all that these toys of ours are not toys at all and take your board, open it up and double check everything. Wiring, connections, insulation, voltages, make sure it is all seated/glued/silicon-ed together, throw/re-purpose your old/puffed LiPo packs (forget about that _one last ride_) and so on. If you don't open up your board frequently, you might be surprised what riding conditions and vibrations can do to the insides.

Ride on but stay safe, my friends!

I'm truly sorry for the lost, I couldn't see mine burning either. But here's the thing, I really don't think it's caused by balance wire as the wire is too thin and it will vaporize (act like fuse) when short due to the high current, hence it will disappear. The only only only possible reason this happens is because one of your solder join come loose (those thick wires) and slapped through the opposite side of the terminal. The other minor possible way is a loose or rubbed off shrink tube due to the vibrations overtime.

This is the thing for all builders. Adding a layer of security into the build is never an issue, this is the so damn reason why I have incorporate as much electrical protection needed.

NUMBER 2 THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT.
I really do like the flexing of the board and the seamless electronics tucked under the board nicely bolted down to the deck. But again this design doesn't incorporate safety as brick, stone, vibrations and water are underneath the board. On top of that those nice locking mechanism avoid fast fire battery disposal. There is nothing you can really do about it, while if you have a clip on case you can easily knock off burning batteries.

Flex kills packs. ITs hard to build a  flexible pack. 

I've been building bamboo mod packs for a while now and they have to flex. On flexy packs like those and this one, you have to be REALLY CAREFUL how you run your balance leads. All nickel needs to be taped over to eliminate any kind of cutting edge. All pgroups need enough slack in the connecting wires to bend. Be careful not to harden the shorter connecting wires by using too much flux and soaking up too much solder. They'll break. 

I've had two packs come back for repairs and i've learned all of this from them. When run correctly, balance leads will "fuse out" but if they have the ability to directly contact nickel or a cell canister at any point along thier path out of thier pack, while "fusing" they can easily weld to the cell or nickel and cause a more permanant short, possibly just enough to thermal runaway. 

This build looked solid. Damn that's a shame.

First I am very sorry about your fire @Eboosted. I am also glad the problem happened during outside use and not during charging!

While I am relatively new to esk8's I have some experience building and designing commercial lithium-ion packs for vehicles.

Here are some design rules you should TRY to follow. I will list them in what I feel is the order of importance for a typical 6-12s skateboard style pack.  While a few of these are "easy" several of the design rules are very difficult to accomplish even at large companies.

1: Monitor and control cell voltage at all times

2: Monitor and control continuous current AND peak currents

3: Monitor and control cell temperatures

4: Propagation/run-away control.

While this list looks simple it is very difficult to accomplish these simple goals. 

Voltage: For the automotive business, we typically use a BMS with 2 relays for redundancy to disconnect the battery from the load or charger. Beware relay/contacts can and do fail and we must expect that.

Current: Again the BMS is designed to communicate with chargers and loads to reduce current demands/supply when we approach current limits, as a backup fuses are also in place for short circuit events. Makes sure the fuses match the operating voltage or they do nothing. It is slowly becoming standard in the industry to individually fuse EACH cell. 

Temperature: While ideal, it is often not feasible to measure the temperature of each cell. With a bit of testing, there is typically a small spread of temperatures of the cells and you can measure the temperature of the hottest cells in the pack. Over temperature is very dangerous because it causes damage to the separator inside the cells.  This leads to "weak short" or small short circuit inside the cell, this increases the cell temp more and does more damage.

Run-away control: shit happens = vibration, things penetrating packs, boards roll into canals, bad temperature sensors, user error, and even bad cells from legit Japanese/Korean cell manufacturers so you have to make sure 1 bad cell/cell fire does not spread to the rest of the pack. This is very hard to accomplish while not causing cells to overheat.

Well it seems the right way to go... with all these wires sticking out the isolation of the wires looks really clean with those PCB's.

But we really have no clue why EBoosted board exploded... but it just scares the hell out of me now!!  I also have recently destroyed a Graphene 4s 6000mAh battery just started getting hot and seep liquid into its cavity. I am now being much much more cautious. Padding the crap out the batteries.

On my 12s4p pack - I am going the way @trampa Frank has.  With tufnol sheath (1.5mm & 3mm) on both impact sides and a polypropylene shell and balance wires tucked away. 

I haven't series soldered the packs yet ( I was going to tonight)... so if you have some of those PCB's for sale...please let me know !

1. All my packs were balanced with a difference of 0.01 - 0.02V
2. There was an additional layer of protection on the head of every cell. 
3. I applied 6 spot welds on every cell, job was mint
4. No BMS was being used at the time of the fire

The theory of the balance wire shorting and causing fire is loosing weight as it happened to several people and that's not enough to start fire

There must have been a bigger short, I'm leaning to be on the charging port, the port was a high quality Switch Craft, it could have been hitted by the last battery pack casing a short. 

That's the most probable thing so far. 

In order to avoid this in the future, I'll secure all individual packs from moving with some kind of stops and use more neoprene so each battery stays put and fits snuggly.

I used a Battery Support 60A BMS for only 1 month before it burnt out, the next 4 months I used the board with no BMS at all, however the balancing wires were still connected to each pack the BMS plug was there disconnected.

1 week before the roast I pulled up the enclosure and checked the voltage of each pack and the difference in between them was 0.02V maximum.

This is a good guess, charging port can be dangerous if exposed. I recommend protecting it with a small fuse. I have 4A charger and I use 5A fuse for it.

Could we do this in another way? Maybe if we fixed the wire right next to the solder, to take away the strain from the hardened part of the wire when the pack is flexing. Maybe with glue of some other way of fixing it without harden. Sort of like this:

(the line from the solder on the lower drawing to the left should have been one dot further to the left :) )

No way to tell if all packs were balanced correctly because you have 4 cells in parallel and you read the voltage as a whole not from each individual cell. Could have been like this 4.3 (cell_1)  4.3 (cell_2)  4.3 (cell_3)  3.9 (cell_4). There could be multiple possibilities and maybe 1 or 2 cells where going bad and they got to low and boom fire. This is why you see people burning there house down trying to parallel charge 4 lipos at once and 1 or 2 packs has bad ir. Just a thought!

Actually, you can tell if you have a bad cell even when they are in parallel that way. If any one of the parallel packs is discharging faster than the other packs, you know have an issue within that parallel pack.

Because battery bags don't contain fires, at best they redirect the flames so then there is less collateral damage. If you actually had a fire proof air tight container, you would essentially have a bomb, since all the heat and pressure will build up inside the enclosure until it reaches breaking point.

My batteries are permanently housed in "fireproof" bags.  I suspect not many people do it because it can be difficult to find the right bag so it's not overly bulky.  I had to modify mine slightly for a good fit.  Even then it still adds some bulk

A lipo bag essentially does 2 things:  insulate the battery with fire-resistant non-flammable material, and more importantly, limit the supply of oxygen to the fire.  Reduce the oxygen flux, and the flame is greatly reduced.  The fire would quickly consume the oxygen in the bag and then nearly extinguish itself because the incoming air supply would be so little.  It's not airtight at all, but it does drastically limit the oxygen supply

Not only are the bags fire-resistant, but they add abrasion and puncture protection.  You mention the lipos were already damaged.  A protective bag might have prevented the damage in the first place

I see people try to make the argument that a "fireproof" bag is not going to do anything, and I don't understand the logic.  I put "fireproof" in quotes because I don't expect it to fully contain a battery fire, but the damage is going to be a lot less.  With how volatile and dangerous these batteries can be, you should be doing everything you can to implement extra safety measures

It is the shock that transferred to the LiPos which caused the damage. The only thing that would have prevented that was a large amount of pading. A battery bag is designed for charging in a static environment and protecting against 'hanger rash'. They aren't designed to protect a battery against thousands of vibrations and impacts over the course of a 15 minute ride. I'm not doubting battery bags can slow down a fire, however that's all they are really good for. Once that lithium is exposed, it WILL eventually combust. At best a battery bag will slow the fire, which I suppose is a desirable trait to an extent.

I think it is important to use fuses!

That's why I will go with:

- small fuse for charging (4A const to charge with 3A)
- bigger fuse for ESC (40A const - 80A peak)

I just had an idea for a enclosure. What if you made a long series of rectangles that fit your battery parallels, but then ontop of each one, you silicon rtv'd a plate on it lightly, if a cell group goes off, the fire/explosion would pop that top plate off, then direct the fire away from the rest of your batteries and board.

I'm positive there would be good demand for these. There is very little products in the battery safety category for e-skate. 

Lipo bags will help contain the fire somewhat, I have seen people test them on youtube and they still shoot some decent flames out the small gaps in the flap. Better than unconstrained I guess. 

Limiting the oxygen will not put them out, once on fire they create their own oxidizer, they will burn in a vacuum! I think it can reduce the electrolyte fire but the lithium will keep burning. I heard the only way to put them out was too cool them down. Liquid nitrogen? The most practical way to contain a fire is a bucket of sand. Well that is not practical if your ridding a skateboard.

You can use a fish paper isolator just make sure nothing is touching it, this way if something heats up it will not compromise the pvc isolator. 

Look at this pic, nothing is touching the isolator so even if the wire burns out it will not radiate enough heat to ignite the glue on the isolator.

Discharge slowly all the way to no charge then dunk in salt water for a few days. The voltage then should be close to zero. Trim off leads. Tape leads. Take to recycling center

Oh ok, so DON'T build a little wooden boat to float the Lipo in a kiddie pool and shoot it with a pellet gun until it self destructs spectacularly and extinguishes itself? Noted.

@scepterr What is that from?

Don't set them on fire, not even for science. There is enough pollution already..🐛

Definitely don't explode it, but make sure to wear a respirator when you totally don't set it off. Lithium poisoning is no fun.

Agreed, but I do my part with my 10kwh PowerWall with salvaged 18650s charged with solar 😉
Earth owes me a fun day 🤣

I'm building a battery pack for a new build out of a used pack ATM, I disassembled it yesterday but during this process the original wrap of each cells was torn apart when pulled the hotglue out, I dremeled the spot welded nickel strips out.

So I heated wrap them and ended up like this.

@kaly your solution is awesome, I'm thinking on a way to just use PVC or any plastic to make these small boards on top of the 4 cells.

[quote="PXSS, post:107, topic:35012, full:true"]
Look up the video on youtube where they test lipo fires in lipo bags. Anything above 4s4Ah burns through the bag
[/quote]

My batteries are individually contained as 3S batteries, wired in series.  This is a Lipo setup but I am planning to build my 30Q 4p pack in the same fashion

Do you have a source for that number?  Not saying I don't believe you, but I just watched half a dozen lipo "fireproof" bag tests on YouTube and they seem to really help contain the fire 

_"Lots of smoke but no flame,"_ says one guy

_"That bag is done. But it contained the fire"_

Look up lipo fire ammo can test. Its a 15min long video of several tests with ammo cans and lipo bags containing large and small Lipos. 

I'm walking my dog rn. I'll look it up later
