Is the m1 finally at a reasonable price or is it still overpriced?

@Mich21050 probably 25r, inboard has shown sag at the end 

@Sn4pz maybe because of the battery swap and it would be better than a boosted in terms of usability

It would be interesting for a cheap swappable battery solution. 3D printed Mount and their pretty generic connector... should be pretty easy.. :slight_smile:

At that price I think its decent for a travel board.

 I think their batteries are air line safe/approved( as much as you can be....).

Ehh, swappable batteries suck bad imo. Modular batteries are okay, but swappable batteries of the size inboard uses are very flawed and have a narrower usecase than most would imagine

not when you have a esc that can barealy even sag a 25r and that would blow if if it went above 20a

Edit this is completely wrong what was I thinking. Pantologist below me is doing it better.

The battery is 43.2v 2.25ah 97wh. This screams A123 ANR26650M1-A (the older cells with 2.3ah) 12s. Same config as original boosted.

The cells are likely very old. Bare cells are like $7-8 so it's a good deal. And the cells can put out a lot of energy. Dunno about pack.

```
Standard specifications would be at nominal voltage. 43.2V/12 = 3.6V/per cell

The pack is 12S1P LG HE4 cells.
