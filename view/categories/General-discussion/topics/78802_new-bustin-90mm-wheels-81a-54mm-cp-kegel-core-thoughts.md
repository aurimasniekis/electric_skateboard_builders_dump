Hey guys, just a FYI just saw this on the Bustin FB page promoting their Duolomo.  Looks to be a similar core to Kegels and Caguamas but will have to confirm.  More wheels options are always a good thing!  Can anyone with experience riding with bustin wheels comment on how their duros feel?

These caught my eye too. I've been riding some of Bustin's 80A, 66mm wheels for about a year now almost every day. As campus cruiser/small commuter wheels, they've held up incredibly well. I was a little concerned about ride comfort with the harder duro, but I've had no issues, even on the rough roads where I live.

If these are the same core size as the Kegels, I'll look into picking up a set. It'll be interesting to see if Bustin decides to release these for individual sale or just keeps them for their Duolomo project.

Hi, sorry if I misunderstand what do you mean increase in kegel core? Are you saying that the size of this core is bigger than kegel?
