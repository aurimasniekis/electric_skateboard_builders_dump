Lots of group rides happening in London but I never see the DIY crew coming along and it's been waaaay too long since I've seen a lot of you.

So let's pick a date where most of us will be able to attend.

The ride is open to everyone no matter if they are on a custom build or an off the shelf.

It's going to be on a Sunday - blame BatMan (@darkkevind) for that ;) 

Please pick a day or days you will likely be able to  come along:

* Sunday 4th Feb
* Sunday 11th Feb
* Sunday 18th Feb
* Sunday 25th Feb
