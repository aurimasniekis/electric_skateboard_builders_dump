I was changing my bearings to ceramic and found melted bearing in the board. because I ride so hard core haha<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/9/f/9fec58def2818652ebceb3a9b8572cd1524e82b7.jpg" width="690" height="388">

You're lucky that your wheels didn't melt ;)
I thought that bearing only become hot if they are bad, because this is not supposed to happen?

Sorry did not introduce myself yet, but here are some bearings from Bones that have only 6 balls (usually 7 balls), less surface contact, less friction, less heat:

Ride hard dude!

Thanks but I already have ceramics. but good to know there is 6 version!

hum.  wonder how true that would be having 6 balls creating less heat.  still the same amount of force now being put into less surface area.

I cannot find the original post where I read this, but here is another post making reference to it, scroll down and see a quote of that post by "Toro", very interesting read about bearings:

  I read that thread and the Toro explanation was contradicted but seems to have validity in that 6 big balls will have to spin less rotations than in a bearing with 7 balls.  Will the faster spinning 7 contact patches have less friction than a 6 ball  even though the load is now greater on the 6 balls?    ...assuming all the same materials and an appropriate grease amount it seems to come to just this question of either less contact with more force on those contact areas vs more contact areas and less force on them I think.  I bet 6 is a hair less friction and therefore cooler and faster but would like to read a decent explanation

Ff = Î¼N this is friction equation, so surface area doesn't matter that much in this regards, and I think 6 bearing goes faster due to less force req to roll 6 balls than 7 balls. actually the greater perpendicular force increases friction. 
but unless we measure, we can't tell for sure. 
6 ball = faster is def marketing

regular bearing maintenence saves lives.
clean and oil your bearings once a week.

that was not the problem tho. melted on high speed. not oil and dirt.

how fast were you going?  that seems pretty extreme to melt a seal. you have probably the 2rs seal ... and says good to 240f.   I've never seen them melt but many times seen the grease cooked out and start to sound like crap and run unsmooth.   maybe the seal got jammed and that built a lot of friction.  if the bearing isn't seizing i bet it's just a jammed seal and the actual balls werent getting that hot.  to get hot enough to melt the seal from speed alone I imagine you'd have to break a landspeed record

or I see you have the rs seal good to 220

a clean decent skate bearing with good quality oil wont melt from high speed.
because the lubrication prevents friction from building heat.

but yeah whatever man, keep telling yourself that your are so fast that you melt bearings.....

To put it another way, not so unkind :slight_smile:

The bearings got hot because they were not clean or not lubricated. These bearings are designed to spin a lot faster than we can spin them on a skateboard, but they will not function as design if dirty or dry.

sorry, I don't mean to come across as rude, I'm just trying to put a bit of reality into the fantasy.
I wont tell anyone if you wont. :yum:

oh, I see. I guess u r right. I just have few of them melted like this in the board. thought it was from spinning fast for too long.
