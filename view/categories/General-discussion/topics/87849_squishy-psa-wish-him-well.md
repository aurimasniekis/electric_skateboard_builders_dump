I know it's a long road to recovery in these situations. If anyone can do it he can.

> **The Costs and How You Can Help** As Sean is currently still in ICU, we have no idea when he will be out of the hospital and into rehab. Rehab itself will be a very long road.

>Sean will get some money from disability through his job with the State of California. However, we are asking for your help in covering the cost of his rental home for a few months.  All of our family lives out of town and it will give us a place to stay in Sacramento while taking care of Sean, and we will not have to worry about what to do with Sean‚Äôs household things until a later date. We will be able to focus solely on Sean‚Äôs recovery if we can get the rent taken care of. Medical bills, once they come in, will surely start adding up fast.  And of course, there will be miscellaneous bills we haven‚Äôt even thought of yet.  

>We‚Äôre asking for your help during this extremely difficult and life altering time in Sean‚Äôs life. Even if you cannot donate, please share this request with someone Sean knew or anyone you think might be interested in helping.

>Thank you and we will update this page when we have new information on Sean‚Äôs recovery.

I've followed this a little bit since initially hearing about it. Despite being a massive stroke he's doing quite well. I've read that he's able to slightly move his left side and can blink / look around. Considering it's been such a short time since the stroke I've no doubt he can have good recovery. Therapy is going to make or break it. Best wishes to him and his family.

Im here, i just finally saw this thread today. Im back in sac but at an old people home for now, learning everything all over again, someday i may skate but for now my wins are things like going to the bathroom. Im talking funny and everyone says i have massive brain injurery or something, maybe it hasnt met me yet. I had lots of weird dreams and i can move my right side, using it to grab girls is another story. I finally competed my dual motor build but i wont get to ride it for some time. My goals include skating and flying but for now i have to make money again. Having a stroke sucks so take care of everything including your health or risk everything like me...

So glad to hear from you again @squishy654. Don't hesitate to take your time and recover properly, and when you do, you'll be able to find your new groove and practically pick up where you left off. Until then take care, brother, and do not hesitate to hop on here and talk with some of your old friends/acquaintance's.
