Hobbyking have just put up a new motor for sale - came online over the last few hours some time. 

https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-sk8-6374-192kv-sensored-brushless-motor-14p.html

I think its worth checking out, so grabbed a couple - ill update as soon as I have some feedback. International express shipping is currently free, so worth it for science. ;-)

Really hope you're joking. Mega ohm is a couple of zeros too much...

if it can really do 4400W then its not bad for 80 squids.

wonder how much power it can push out when used with there sk8-esc? if they were a good pair then <£150 motor and esc is a good deal.

now they just need to make a VESC6 and were sorted.

the multi-rotor market jumped forwards leaps and bounds once hobbyking got on-board and started driving the costs of esc's and motors down. hopefully the same will start to happen with eskate :)

Looks to be like any other sealed 6374. The max wattage is determined mostly by the stator size, which indicates iron and copper. For the brave souls who buy it, do see if you can measure the stator.

Looks promising, is length going to be a problem on 218 TB trucks? It's very heavy which is maybe intentional.

The savings bundled with the new VESCs make a package worthwhile

my MoeBro did his up/down hill taco & tepe rides on 6mm shafts, stress fractures resulting from 10,400w tearing up/down a mountain he has up graded to 8mm. I can reference many motors that produce more power (30-50%) on a 8mm shaft... it starts ti become about the bearings... and like 8mm skate/axles trucks, not so much the diameter but the quality

8mm shaft with that kind of power is also questionable :slight_smile:
[/quote]

I want to lathe down the shaft of this motor from 10mm to 8mm so it fits the pulleys I can find. because I can't find a pulley with 16-18 teeth and has a 10mm bore diameter. I have never thought of that the shaft would be to small to handle the needed torque.

I still think that an 8mm shaft is capable to handle the torque I need but am realy interested in your opinion. I don't know a lot about it and you do so what are your thougts?

Yes it is a single drive but that's probably not the reason.

I have drilled a 10mm hole in an 8mm bore motorpulley, it was all fine and dandy but after riding it for 2 days it broke. The 10mm hole was the reason probably.

That's why I want to lathe down the shaft to 8mm so it is capable for more pulleys :slight_smile:

It is like the 10mm/8mm skate axle debate? Some started to go 10mm, then others started making their 8mm axles out of stronger material so they where compatible with all the bearings... for example my 8mm ronin axles are more than strong enough to be extended for multiple widths, some cheap truck with a sloppy kingpin and bushings, I wouldn't trust though!

I recall seeing a method for testing kv around here using VESC -  Ill hit it up as soon as my motors come in.

Ive been hanging out for the right price 6374 to become available - SK3s have been sold out at hobbyking for the last 6 weeks, and didnt feel like spending AUD200 + on other options per motor. While this turnigy SK8 is an untested motor (by the community)- it ticks the boxes for everything I was looking for - and for a great price. Sensored is a bonus.

No concern, spacing is 44mm. It looks like they have dual mounting holes per corner. Maybe this is to consider the placement of phase wires. Or maybe they are compatible with boosted mounting holes.

It's crazy, this morning they only had 6374s listed for 192kv and I wished they had lower KVs...now they do!!  Pretty sure you can all thank me for wishing them into existance!! :smile:

So the big question is...for an e-ATB do I wanna go as low as 130kv?  I notice Trampa motors have a super low kv, and I'm really not too bothered about the top end, I just want more grunt.  But then people are speculating the kv is lower than advertised anyways.  Hmmmm...I'm currently rocking SK3 6374 168kv and they are perfect (apart from the cogging!).  149kv?

I love 149, best at 12s if you run 5:1 due to top speed (currently around 38 km/h at 10s). Shitload of torque, isn't a hill I can't climb where I live.

What do you consider good speed?
Depending on your hardware and voltage, I would personally always go for the setup with the lowest KV that will still get you the max top speed you are after. That in the end gives you the best of both worlds (torque and speed). Everything else (surplus topspeed) is just for show ;)

the sk8 esc looks like its just a hardware 4.12 vesc... which there are other suppliers for. i'd say go with the esc is accessible to your wallet, because you can get anything from the 80$ range to around 200$ for a hardware 6 esc

Maybe this is a good thing? Super short phase wires on motor side would make an eventual wire break  less likely there. The bend will be on wires on esc side, which are easier to replace or repair. Just a thought.

The size of these motors is somewhat disappointing. I was hoping they would be smaller than the SK3 series motors. Instead it seems to share the same problem as the SK3s. It's simply too bulky and heavy for what is essentially the same sized stator as an equivalently designated Maytech.

The thing is UUUGE! I wonder what size the stator is? Who is going to open one up first and measure for us so we can compare to other motors. I'm going to put 5 bucks on same size stator as SK3. But would be happy if they are larger. 

Going to be hard to run these as dual. They will fit on TB218's but only just with the axle nuts at the end of the thread which is not that safe.

It's the hobby king mount on the hobby king trucks. The shaft is longer because it's meant to fit inside the gear cover that has a bearing in it to support the shaft. Their components work very well when used together.

I just so happen to have an SK3 6374 & 6364 on my bench in pieces. The 6374 stator is about the same size at 50.6mm diam. X 45.6mm tall. The 6364 is the same diameter, but only 35mm (closer to 36mm) tall. Off the top of my head, the SK3 6354 was 25mm tall, and the Torqueboards 6355 was 30mm tall.

So, in summary, this new turnigy sk8 6374 motor has approximately same stator dimensions (and likely copper mass) as previous motors, however the can is longer. 

(Correct, Any EE guys or esk8 elders care to chime in?)

-there is a small key
-Can + shaft collar measure 89mm, making a dual set up on single truck (of the 218 TB variety) unlikely.

Depends on the level of risk your happy with and how fastidious you are with maintenance. I think it could work. I once had a rear wheel come off while ridding (different trucks) but it was due to the nut being at the end of the thread and the nut was kinda old so the nylock was worn. I was not going that fast and as it was a rear wheel it just dragged on the ground so it was not dangerous in that situation. 

If you do it, use fresh nuts and maybe some lock tight. Also check they are tight regularly.  

 _(Alternatively cut 5mm of each end of the hanger to make it really safe.)_  
Edit! Actually I dont think that will work if your already pushing the motor mount and wheel all the way out to fit the motor, more axle towards the inside won't help. :thinking:

The total lengths on Hobbyking seem correct, except they don’t include the rear nub which is just under 9mm.

Does it make sense to anybody how these motors are designed? 
Seems they have a cooling fan but no ventilation holes. 
And a large amount of lost space between the stator and the fan. 
And the outer shell is 62mm but that's not where the magnets are. They seem to be 1,5mm more in which results in 58mm diameter or even less.

Yes and no. The fan even though fully sealed should help redistribute the heat from the stater to the can which is ribbed. Obviously open would cool better but then it would suck dirt into the motor. 

What I do not like is all the extra length at the rear of the motor. Can't see how that serves any purpose?

This is just a theory, but I think it attaches to the blue part of the can with that screw hole at the front. So it can spin. Otherwise its just a waste of space and money.

Edit. If true it means the front of the can is supported by the large fan bearing, which should make the motor more reliable. :crossed_fingers:t3:

It is common in motor manufacturing for hobby stuff like ours to make the can a little bigger than it needs to be. I see this all the time with inrunners for rc cars. The stator iron and the windings are about 10cm away from the wall of the can. My guess is they do this to make the motor look like it has more volume. bigger motor is better right?

Don't fall for it. We all know on here that the copper mass and stator volume is what really matters

Alright boys,

So slightly dumb question:[SK8 6374-149KV](https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-sk8-6374-149kv-sensored-brushless-motor-14p.html) or [6374 190KV](collections/electric-skateboard-starter-collection/products/electric-skateboard-motor-6374-190kv) for a Trampaboard? Looks like the SK8 has more power (W), and is cheaper by like $40 when you include the sensor adapter, and looks a bit more waterproof. I'm tempted to do the 149KV SK8 because of the torque to speed comparison. I don't forsee myself needing to go 35mph (yet!), and added torque is always a plus! Thoughts?

By the looks if it, dual SK8's will fit on Trampaboard Vertigo trucks, is that correct?

I plan on running FOCboxes with a 12s4p battery, 66/14 gearing, anything seem wrong? Aside from needing to convert from 5.5mm bullets to 4mm banana plugs.

Thanks!

I still don't have any problem without seal of the motor. im actually waiting my 260kv to die but can't kill this thing really.

@onepunchboard
I understand, but have you put on thousands of mile on these new skate motors in FOC sensored mode? Do it, then form an opinion or comparison...I've ridden both, a lot, the sk3 didn't last long on my setup, even with it's additional power over the orange 125kv motor, noted I never experienced rocks or pebbles going into the sk3, it is possible while it's impossible on the sk8 motors, the 14 poles, and sensors on these will equal extreme smoothness on a vesc in FOC mode....the smoothness of these motors is unsurpassed..they are efficient, robust and pull smoothly from a standstill...what more can you ask for? As for fitting them onto existing setups or dual mounts..well they just came out give it a little time for the truck makers to measure them and make you guys some sick stuff to make them dance..I wonder if HK is going to release a 100amp vesc and some way to dual mount these. They already need more pulley options badly. I have a feeling this is just the beginning.

If you use these motors on the HK motor mount with it's cover and the brash tubes, then you won't need lock-tight, the brash tubes keep the pulley centered over the key, even if the setscrews come completely loose. Because there is a bearing on both ends of the shaft in the system those tubes allow for force on both sides, basically trapping the pulley on the key. I have ridden this setup without lock-tight and the set screws came undone and it still got me home safe and sound with some extra play on the pulley and belt, and then I tightened it back up and have been riding it since, no lock-tight involved...so don't glue the things on, just use the proper mount for the motor and all the correct parts as they were designed and the benefits multiply...the little cover over the motor pulley is nice for protecting it too and helps keep the system aligned and straight....

First impressions of this motor: not great. 

I have briefly tested this motor (6374 192kv) on a 10s3p li-ion pack with 15/36 gears on 90mm wheels. I tested this on a 12s esc, not a vesc. 

It pulls strong, but it doesn't quite feel like the 6374's I'm used to. I topped out at 20mph, which seems low. I can reach 22-23mph on the same board with a single racerstar 200kv motor. My tesseract with a single 6374 can easily hit 28mph.

I've also ridden their orange 125kv sk8 motor, which was very torquey. So I'm starting to believe there is little variation in these motors, other than can size and kv.

Edit: Just went for a ride on a full charge, hit 23mph. I think there's more potential in these motors than I first thought. I need to try it on a vesc. Will report back.

Hey,

I picked up the 149Kv ones for a mountainboard build I will be making in the next week or two.

As far as teeth/pulleys, it really depends on how fast you want to go, and how much torque you want. Here is a calculator that is highly recommended in this community: http://calc.esk8.today/ Enter your values for what you want, and adjust the gear ratios to get your desired speed/hillclimbs.

When it could to lengths of belts, it's difficult to tell exactly. It really depends on the spacing on your motor mounts, your desired tension, and if you have an idler pulley or not. So some users recommend buying the belts after you have set up your pulleys, and use a string to measure the total distance required. I personally just asked someone that had similar pulleys/hubs/mounts and got a rough guess. I'll find out next week if it works!

The belt length will be different for street and AT setups, since the pulleys will be different. You might be able to use the same belt, but you would need a really good idler pulley setup, and it doesn't seem super practical.

I'll let you know how my build goes.

I was in a similar situation and did a bunch of searching some places like Granger are asking over $50.00 per belt.  I  give V Belt Supply two thumbs up.  I hope your experience is a as good as mine.  I needed one replacement and was looking to have a spare and at that price just ordered 4 belts... one less thing to worry about.  It really sucks when you have to run your dual with single motor.  The difference in torque and breaking is substantial.

Once you go dual you will never go back...

My first impressions of this motor are quite the opposite: Im loving it.  - I had some technical hitches to sort out before I could really take it for a test, but over the weekend went out for a couple of hours. 

6374 192kv.  10s Lipo 8000mah 30c. 15/36  97mm wheels.   Pulls strong - too strong - Im toning down the current settings tonight. I easily hit 38kph (23mph) and had lots of room to push more. I believe 45kph (28mph) should be within reason without changing my gearing. 

Im a larger guy - 115kg (250lbs) and my board is single motor. It is hauling me around at more than enough acceleration, with a top speed that works well for my ability level. It smashes any hill I have gone at. I ride with a friend who is around the same size as me and has an identical board setup - his feelings about the motor were exactly the same. 

On the other hand, I am not happy that I wont be able to fit 2 on the TB 218mm trucks. That was the direction I was hoping to head.

Not to get off topic but I would say different about there service.  I accidentally bought the wrong belt and called them up explained the situation and the guy who answer I believe his name was Rich.  Said well if you want to replace them there is a 30% restocking fee on the total price and you will have to ship them back to us and then pay shipping for the new belts.  Shipping to me was $9.00 almost the price of 2 belts and it was ups ground that took 4 days to get to me.  I asked if I would get credit back for the first shipping and they said no so I said so I dont get my shipping back plush a restocking fee that is more then the shipping was.  It seems like some people got there belts from them in the past and they would exchange them without issue but not the case anymore.  

You can get belts on Amazon with prime and free returns and no restocking fee.  I'm all for helping smaller companies and giving my business to them over the big corporations but in this case no because I would have  basically paid for my belts doubled after the return and only had the 2 sets I ordered.

Ha, just so happens I also purchased the wrong belts...

Got 390-5m-09! 9mm wide belts?!?! Anyhow, I sent in an email, tried calling, tried submitting a contact on their website all within 10 minutes of the accidental purchase. Purchase was STILL "PROCESSING" during my first 3 correspondences... 

[According to their website](http://www.vbeltsupply.com/returnpolicy.html?SID=1nejbvel5lakbuhu12iirgdtp0):
> Once an order is processed, the order can not be changed, added to or canceled.

But my 3 attempts to contact them BEFORE my order was processed were apparently futile???

Called them again this morning and someone told me "Sorry, can't refund, already cut and processed"... He told me it would be better to just wait for them to arrive, and it would not be worth sending them in for a refund because of the 30% restocking fee as well.

Note to all buyers: make sure you double check what you're ordering.. :O

Good shout!

Posted over yonder at https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/new-htd-belts-swap-trade/53489. Kind of a weird request - might just run 9mm's until my 15mm's arrive in a month or so... No down sides to running a thinner belt except for additional breakage chance? Less surface area might cause more slippage?

Thanks for the tip!

9mm side by side another 9mm belt on a single pulley?

Unfortunately not planning to do that - I don't think my pulley is wide enough. I just would be running a single 9mm pulley per side for about 2 weeks to a month until my original order of 390-5m-15 belts arrives from China... Then just hope they fit!

Note to self: never order belts from China... Today's full of learning!

Edit: Proper belt tensioning in a setup like this (dual rear drive with 9mm belts) should eliminate any belt slipping issues.

I bought two of the new 6354 200kv motors and I have to say they perform exceptional. Before that I had two 6355 from torqueboards. They were really nice as well, but they weren´t as reliable as I had hoped. One of them broke again and I needed a new one. Instead of buying a new one and paying 40 Dollars for shipping, because I live in Germany I decided to buy completlely new ones. And I am surprised. They even perform slightly better. I didn´t expect them to be that good, because they were that cheap (10 % off thanks to a coupon). Only problem was, they were too big to fit on a dual rear. So, I went with a dual diagonal. Had to do some filing and rearranging, but got it to work.  Can´t seem to find a big difference between those two methods though. I have to do further testing. So, first impression: great motors

If you move one motor mount up slightly and one down so the black nipples can overlap you could move them in 3 or 4mm each side and get more threads on the nut. Sure it will look a little funny though.

You can get away without the kit above - I used an M20 washer with m5 x 45mm cup head screws and drilled out holes for the screws to go through - works like a charm.

That said you went for the sensored motor which has the extra long shaft which interfaces with this kit for extra strength - definitely the better way to go if you don't mind spending the extra little bit of cash

Or you can cut a groove in the shaft, post 5

https://www.rcgroups.com/forums/showthread.php?1079423-How-to-repair-an-electric-motor

One thing to be aware of is to not have the circlip above the mounting surface if your motor mount has a narrow pass through. 

The Racerstar motor does a good job of recessing it.

@Eboostin Wait.. so for what purpose that "collar" ring can be used?

I got one in sk3 5055 kit as well.. wasnt sure what is its purpose.. only option i see now, is ir axle is really long, maybe it can go at end of axle to stop pulley from moving sideways

It is used for the same purpose as a circlip, you can use one or the other. If you use the collar, you have to make a small dimple in the shaft for the grub screw @Okami

Ok guys the can should not wiggle in and out. The problem is it's not being used with the rest of the hobbyking kit. There is a brass bushing that slides on the motor shaft first. Then the pulley. When installing the pulley you need to take up end play in the motor can and shaft. I set mine with just a tad bit of clearance. Maybe .3mm to .5mm of end play after installing pulley.  Lock down the pulley  and check for free end play movement if your using something other than the stock hobbyking components.

I have enjoyed three of these engines. My first configuration was with the D5035-125kv and the experience was quite even, but adjusted with 12S and 36 - 15 teeth. Currently I have mounted a dual configuration facing the same axis with two SK8 6364 192kv and the power is great, although I have noticed that the displacement of the stator causes the belt to move. I would like to ask you if the fact that one of the engines had more resistance could give me intermittent acceleration and braking failures. I have them connected by Can-bus.

Sorry, I've uploaded the same photo twice. The gears are printed. these are 40 teeth and 15 in the engine. The maximum speed to which I have dared have been 54 km / h although I am sure that I still had gas. I'm doing tests and one is printed in Abs and another in Nylon. The truth is that the result is similar. Before I had it with 36 teeth and the gas was endless.

I'd go with the tried and true sk3. If you have any experience with motors, maybe buy some high quality bearings to replace the stock ones. Bearings are the only issue I've had with mine, though problems didnt arise till 2 years of riding a single motor. Almost worth just buying a whole new motor every year because of how relatively inexpensive they are

Once you mount the motor put the long brass tube on the shaft first. Then I would insert key into the keyway and slide pulley onto shaft. At this point I would push in on can and in on pulley to be sure its 100% together. Then maybe back off just a fraction of a mm. So that once the pulley is tightened up the motor can, will just barely move in and out. You could prob have the clearance tight as well but sometimes just the right amount of slop can be a good thing. I hope this makes sense and helps.... I'm a noob....... but a noob with a hobbyking kit. lol

edit: if belt alignment is off gonna have to move the entire mount.

The long brass tube comes with the motor in its bolt bag.

from what i can surmise the sk8 internally is the same as sk3 but is sealed with shorter phase wires.

i just put two of the 6364 190kv motors on a new build last night.  got it calibrated with a very short test ride.  motors are very nicely balanced and quieter than the TB 6374, as punchy as the sk3 (anecdotally).

only thing is you'll need to supply your own key.  i just wound up crimping up some nickel strip into a key.

I've been running those motors for a while and the only time the motor can came loose it was because of a loose pulley. But the shaft collar needs to be on the shaft and there should be no play between the pulley and the collar. In my application I was able to adjust the position of the mount and the position of the wheel so there was no need for me to move the pulley on the shaft.

Just returned from work and made a short video, I think I have the same problem with one motor (I have 2).

@gaetjen these motors have no circlip that's why you have to use the brass tube (you can cut it and use addidtional washers to bridge the gap between motor and pulley). At least in my case the rattle is gone but 1 motor can doesn't move at all while the other does and I would like to know why.

My can including shaft moves exactly 0.3mm including the tiny screws on the side. I think they are bolted to the fan but no idea. I think this pic is from you @Ackmaniac maybe you have some insight. EDIT: the pic is from @Arzamenable or? :laughing:  

![image|564x499](upload://3hnUtjrhP5iWyuujOgUiOxQp94Y.jpeg)  

Both motors are the same length when I pull the can on one motor (also the tiny screws on the side look better centered). But then the can moves/rattles. When I push the can back 0.3mm the motor length is shorter than the other but with mounted gear no more movement.

Even more strange is that when I spin the can the amount of movement differs.

@Eboosted I checked all screws, they are tight

Does somebody know what's going on here?

But you use the brass tube between motor and pulley/gear, right?
If so then there is no play when properly mounted. But good to hear it doesn't lead to problems while riding. Maybe I'm just too much worried because I want to glue the gears. It's just so strange that only one motor can has play.

@Eboosted now I got it :laughing: tried it but unfortunately no difference at all.

@rich Thanks for the video. I did use the brass tube between pulley and motor already and it helped, but there is still a little bit of gap to the side. It´s just strange that one motor rattles and the other one doesn´t. Tighting the axle screw didn´t make any difference

is it normal for a 6374 to have 45mm stators?

If the can still moves try following, remove the grub screw of the pulley, then push the can towards the motor plate. Push the pulley along the shaft back until there is zero gap between motor, brass tube and pulley and tighten the grub screw. The rattle should be gone now.

There a different type of motors available but in most cases I would say yes.
My Unik (Maytech) 6374 have also 45mm stators.

So I've been running these motors for a while now on Marc mounts and so far, I've had to RMA two of them. One of them the sensors died. The other, well...

![image|666x500](upload://fHJuZ7MtICXBIyjToIWCDbBe5VE.jpeg) 
The screws holding the motor to the baseplate sheared in half while I was doing light braking. For reference I'm 125-130lb.

I had a third one that was starting to get a ton of play in the can that I couldn't fix by tightening grub screws so I think that one was about to go as well. I've switched to Hoyt motors now. 

Unrelated who wants to buy 4 brand new sk8-6354? :smiley:

Mainly the fan and also the hall sensor is placed on the front but don't know if that takes more space.

I didn't, but isn't the brass tube for spacing the pulley? Either way I feel like the motor shouldn't pull itself apart like that...

This type of motors have no circlip like usual so they could come apart. Trampa motors are similar style and this is a page of their motor manual where this is mentioned.

Holy moly wow I never knew coming apart like that is expected if you don't use the spacer tube... 

Edit: I've been trying to work it out and I still can't figure out why the spacer tube would matter for the shearing screws... Can somebody explain? Is it balancing forces or something?

Because the brass tube is like a normal c-clip, without it, you can take the can out from the stator. Same thing goes for your Hoyt i believe.

Magnetic forces pushes can away from stator and loads would brake motor I guess or etc shit I guess :D But my question then wouldn't brass tube brush against baseplate of motor?

[/quote]

The motor bearing sits 6mm deeper than the baseplate (inside). The hole in the baseplate for the shaft is 10mm and the outer diameter of the brass tube 9mm. So with a 6.5mm brass tube it sticks out 0.5mm from the baseplate. Damn hope you know what I mean it's hard to explain in english :laughing:

More and more I understand the whole construction of the SK8 motors.

[/quote]

Without the brass tube and no gap all the forces are on the tiny screws on the side which hold the can to the fan. It looks like plastic to me. So it seems like the fan or the fan bearing is moving. But still don't undstand why only one motor has this play.

![image1|600x500](upload://1uyrmI2IoFxBS4utZB8gxJquRo6.jpeg)

And the 3 screws at the baseplate around the shaft hold the stator

With me, it's because the big bearing can move a little bit in the fan 'house', in the same way the bearing can move in Trampa superstar wheels. They are not pressfit.

Update. I only have this little play, when the brass/pulley is not mountet.

So basically you don't want the shaft to have any space so slip backwards?

So then you'd place a washer on either the motor mount or the motor in that photos case and then press the pulley against it making sure there is a little tension on the shaft so that the shaft wouldn't go out through the back right?

But If you have a circlip on then you don't have to worry about that right?

It's not the shaft only, the can moves as well

In any case you need the brass tube first and then washers if needed.

It's always easier with pictures....

Normally motors have some washers and then a circlip on the shaft which holds the motor together.

![Circlip|690x367](upload://ibLVRoD27wq9SlQEtL5vKBOmBZI.jpeg) 

The SK8 motor has no circlip, as you can see the motor bearing is 6mm inside

![114920|690x388](upload://6Td6iaeuNmPlUutQhAjHstuimOo.jpeg) 

If you want to make a groove for a circlip or add washers you need the brass tube first.

Good luck finding a rod with ID=8mm and OD= 9mm. The original is exactly 9.07mm OD. The info about OD=10mm on Trampa's page is wrong.

The SK8 has no circlip that's why a spacer between motor bearing and pulley/gear is necessary. The space between motor plate and motor bearing is 6mm (inside the 10mm hole of the motor with 8mm shaft). That's why the tube must be smaller than 10mm outside.

6.5mm brass tube from Trampa
![191758|690x388](upload://oYFu4VGsNM6ipnIaiulHiuo9BSF.jpeg) 

Slided on the shaft, only 0.5mm sticks out now

![192431|690x388](upload://7QNcdJ6lV51bEwjqwBaFjeIs9GB.jpeg) 

Needs more washers to fill the gap

Thank you for the measurements.   I will try my best.  I was wondering why my motor move about 1 cm or 2 when I push on the pulley side way.   Maybe I can email hobbyking and ask for replacement parts.

Then 17mm is way too long anyway and you would have to cut it. Personally I prefer the shorter brass tube and adding washers. The shipping for small parts from Trampa is not that expensive (I think a bit less than 10€) and they have all types of washers in different thickness, too.

$12 is not that bad.  But I can not justify paying $11 shipping for a $1.2 item.  I should be able to find some tubs or sand the side of wheel bearing spacers to 9mm wide and bore of 8mm.  It's DIY here.

Hi , i coming to have the sk8 149kv . I use this with 10s batterry and focbox . Normally we can use this at 3500w . But mine , are hot after only 2km (90°c motor, outside 30°c) . And that with only 60a motor for 1380w (in ackmaniac app)
My config app is normal , motor max/min 60 , battery max 60 , min 16 . And the brake are very soft . Do you know what's problems ??!!
I have 2 motors and it's same for the two .
I have motor mount carbon of trampa , and the screw are original . If you have any idea thx ...
