I have a Nuff 2000w E-board and I think I burned out a hub. Anyone know how to get a replacement hub? Nuff says $250 to replace it. That seems high. Anyone with ANY ideas?
Thanks in advance!

That looks like a rebranded Onan x2.. Search to see if you can find sleeves. Should be no more that $50 for both...

OH wait you are talking about motors?

Yes one of my hubs started clicking then stopped. All within 5 minutes. I have  ot take. It apart as I just had two cervical discs in my neck replaced and cant do much for a few weeks.
I love the board and was trying to see if anyone else had this problem. I dont ride it too hard either. Live in Florida so no hills. It was strange. I was just running up to grab a script from the pharmacy whem I got home I popped out the battery to charge it and when I bumped the hub I heard the clicking. Next day was surgery and I am a bit limited by what I can do.
Do you guys think the $250 is a good price for one 1000w motor?

absolutely not. Theyre bending you over at that price. 

You can and should do better. Whos to say that the second 250 dollar motor wont fail like the first? :man_shrugging:

Maybe its time to swap motor and esc combo? own/meep/wow have pretty good controllers currently

I am in the Daytona Beach area. I am willing to admit my ignorance in repairing the board as I am all thumbs do to the neck issue. Hands dont always do what I tell them to do. (Nerve damage)

Its a shame that Nuff is gouging me for the motor. Makes me think less of them. I would pay $100 without even thinking about it but the $250 rubs me raw. Anyo e else out there had issues with these boards?

Have you tried swapping over the motor to the other connection to check its really the hub

I thought I had broken a hub but it turned out to be the ESC, ended up buying 2 news hubs then an ESC

That would of been a great solution too since @Battosaii and that Miami esk8 group is a rather large group.  If memory serves me right that is like a 4hr or 4.5hr drive from Miami.  If anything he could probably know some people with equipment that could help him out.

I have a few onan boards, they're okay. You can replace the motors with a set from meepo/wowgo/ownboard, but you have to use their truck so the setup all together is $150 for 2 new hubs + truck. I have ridden about 3000km on a couple sets of them and had no issues and I know many others who've done similar so they are pretty reliable. backfire also sells nice and cushy hubs with thick urethane you could consider. They all fit rather well into the onan chasis.

I currently get 24mph on flat roadways. Would these hubs be able to do that too?
If so if you have the part numbers I will order today.
Want to get the board up and running by the time I am healed up.

Kind of, the only problem is the hall sensor. It dosen't fit through the gap, so you kind of have to dissassemble it or just splice the wires for it. When you try to pull out the existing truck from the ESC housing the bullet cables can fit if you poke them through one at a time but the hall sensor won't.

Well I got a reply from Onan in China today. They are willing to sell me the original engine for $65 plus shipping.
So for around $90 I will be back to running right about the time my neck heals from the two level disc replacement I had last Tuesday!!

unfortunately unless someone has used that exact combo, theres a chance that they wont work together. My Koowheel hubs and Ownboard ESC will NOT work at all. 

Seems like a gamble, unless someone chimes in.

Im sure because I ordered 2 of them for my Onan X2.
Nuff is just rebranded.

If the Nuff version worked it would be great. But it has failed me too soon.
Plus they're dropping in price big on eBay. I saw one for sale the other day for $239 delivered. Brand new.

Dont understand the problems people have with the Nuff or the same Onan X2 model. I really never ever had any problems with it, except that i broke the inner aluminium cover of the motors by hitting the sidewalk hard as i do always hahahaha...I just replaced them for 3 dollars and that it was. I had either any remote connection problems nor any issue on my drives. Don't know for sure if there are the same parts build in both models(Nuff and Onan), but it seems like this. Anyhow, I love my Onans and the 4WD is a real weapon.

Well I disassembled everything on the enough board I mean everything. I took apart the ESC and found to burn marks underneath it. I bought a replacement ESC for $62 clean the hubs grease tubs and suddenly everything is working perfectly.

Now I got a corroded esc from my sisters sons Onan X3 drive.
Disassembled everything, too and saw the esc got some water and almost died.
I said almost because i can turn the drive on and ride it but i just can accelerate up to 10kmh(or maybe slower) and then theres something like a cutout. The drive stays on power and after slowing down i can accelerate again up to 10kmh until the cutout happens again and so on. Nice to know the price of an esc now so no worries hahaha.
This leads me to my first experience in the diy sector. 
Also disassembled a dead battery pack which died because of condensation inside, too.

Now, after reading lots of threads (the onan x2 hack spud thread was interesting but i expected much more than how it turned out in the end) and knowing a bit more about batteries I really need to know the KV rating of the Onan x2 hubs.Does anyone Know about the KV rating?

I would like to know if it is possible to build (copy) the battery pack in 10s2p configuration with 30Q cells instead of the 22P cells that Onan uses without damaging the esc or the hubs?
I saw that the bms in the packs takes space for 4 more batteries, what means if i use a balance charger I could fit 4 more cells in there easily which makes a 12s2p configuration possible if the motors and esc can handle that amount of power, but the esc could be changed to vesc or flipsky if it is the weak point with 12s battery.
With a bit modification on the Battery enclosure a 9s3p configuration with 18650 cells could be done as well i think because theres space for 27 cells in total without big modifications. 
What do you guys think?

I put a cheap $45 ESC that came with the remote from eBay in mine. It only goes 19 miles an hour now but it does have four speeds. For $60 you can get one that will go faster. As far as the battery I'm unsure.

You might be able to fit more cells 10 -> 12s but will the ESC handle it? Obviously if you're going with a vesc alternative you'll likely be fine

@JohnyEvil I will replace it with the original Onan X2 esc first and change the motors as well (from x3 to x2 motors). The esc comes complete with remote receiver installed so i can use my old remote again.

@Sn4pz yes i have to change esc to vesc or flip sky esc for 12s configuration.
But its just an idea. At first i will use original parts and batteries. First try on batteries is to switch cells from 22P into 30Q in 10s2p, but this will be a future project because I'm not able to solder my own battery packs right now (my wallet needs a recovery hahahaha) 
Another option is 9s3p or 8s3p by using a balance charger to skip the bms for more space.
Edit: Only problem with 2 vesc could be the space, but it could work...i will try that when my wallet is healthy again :wink:

I ended up swapping out the ESC with one I found on Ebay for $36 and bought a back up battery for $57 on Ebay. Works just fine now!
I am almost done with my frankenstein board. Its part Ownboard part Flipsky and a brand new sweet pintail!

Hi, itz been a while,...
I ended up with modding up all my drives and got two boards in the streets since this summer.
One 4wd, and one dual. The Modifications proofed reliability for about 4 month by daily abuse and hard torture curbs. Still working on more modifications like maximizing water resistance specially on  rockered decks.

i just can do battery builds just in theory bc i read and learned a lot about battery packs in here, but my plan is to hook up a professional battery builder to do me some packs if i need them.
edit: so i can choose other cells then the 22p samsungs AND i can use the bms which are already  in the packs

You can even use 21700 cells in there. Sorry for being unclear.
