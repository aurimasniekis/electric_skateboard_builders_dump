Hey guys! 

I'm a currently a college student and want to build a cruiser that could be used around town. I've been searching for hours and hours trying to find the right deck for my first commuter build with very little luck. The things that I am primarily looking for are: 
1. Absolutely needs a kicktail
2. No longer than 31" 
3.  longer than 16" of wheelbase. 
4. Wide enough width (>8")

And with these primary things in mind I did find a couple of boards that satisfy this requirement
1. Bustin Hybrid Cruiser https://bustinboards.com/products/bonsai-ecore-hybrid-cruiser ("16.5" wheelbase)
2. Jet Spud (21" wheelbase) no kicktail
3. Arbor Rally (20" wheelbase) narrow front
4. Globe Decks ("18.5" wheelbase) narrow front
5. Zenit Hibiscus https://www.zenitboards.com/product/hibiscus/ (17" wheelbase)

This will be my first build and I'm relatively new so I have very minimal skills to build a board. The things you would need to do to build a dual 6355 with 10s3p on a 15" wheelbase seems a little bit overwhelming and don't look aesthetically pleasing at all. The deck I have my mind set on is the Zenit Hibiscus and the Bustin Cruiser, but the wheelbase is what stops me. Jet Spud builds by @Jc06505n, @XTLA, @Eboosted is exactly what I am shooting for. It has a slim enough enclosure so it's not bulging out and it's compact with power. 
 But if I can't acheive that on a 17" wheelbase I would even compromise to a single motor to make it happen or even a smaller battery if I have to. But preferably I would want to fit dual 6355 with 10s3p is this even possible on a 17" wheelbase deck without making it look like a tank?

I think @jlabs has a Jet spud with a kicktail in the works right now so maybe ask him if those will be released anytime soon.

Check out the prebuilt esk8 Ride ripetide r1. I might be letting go of my deck with enclosure very soon. Willing to give ya a good price.
It will fit a meepo sanyo 10s4
I did a custom grip on mine but that's easily removed if demon gods ain't your thing

@Skunk thanks for the offer, but I really want a project from scratch and choose the parts I want for the board. personally not digging the handle bars either.  
@JLabs are you serious? Can I buy them? like now?

All good. I was only offering the deck, not a built board at all. I didn't like the handles myself at first, but I'll tell ya it's really handy when going in and out of shops on my board.  I'm definitely adding a handle to my new deck.

that would be the only option right? like a 3s2p Lipo with a single motor. I honestly don't like the looks of that bulge lol I think I'll just wait for @JLabs kicktail equipped Jet Spud  it's making me drool just thinking about how sexy it's going to look :)

I think you could start with make some drawing layout for setup needed, measure everything before you buy them (battery, esc/vesc, motor mount, etc). then you can decide which deck you can work with unless you already decide the deck you want. Jet spud very recomended for short deck, you can find many setup in this forum. With dual motor i think @eboosted will be great for your reference to start with.

@boogiewookie
I use 2x 5s lipos in series with a Vesc and a single TB 6374 motor on a Sector 9 short board and it works pretty great.

the thing is I wouldn't mind that setup except I want something sleak and the danger of a Lipo is something I don't want to deal with especially for my first board yk. maybe in the future I'd do it for an extreme budget board, but for the first one I'm not afraid to spend an extra couple bucks to build this thing

This deck is pretty sick. Might be a touch too long though. 
Also, have you considered an old school skate Deck re issue as an option? Such fun boards to ride. Usually meeting your wheel well and length parameters. 
I used an old cab deck and I freaking love it.

Moonshine sidkick it's 34 with a kick and plenty of wheel base options...i was in the same boat as you love 30inch decks wanted the Spud too...got a lanyatchz pug boat and turbo bird for a lil commuter board .. but then I got one of these and fell in love..super light and very stable as it's a DH race and freestyle sliding weapon of fun..light very and stable at speeds if your familar with riding down hill..not to aggressive concave great for actually riding for amount of time  it has a slick ass rocker to the board for pushing and feeling much lower then the usual top mount decks..I have the 39 outlaw now and the rocker is like a 45km carving pocket on my carvon speed drive build.. black one is the 34 sidkick white one is the original 39 outlaw ..I know to long .. just showing the shape of it to reference from. Both decks are the same like  Landy with the Evo and and mini evo falcon ..30 to 34 is not much of a difference couple inch each side and it opens a world of different decks to choose from with great wheel base options..just a thought I was once there..I'm a older now and don't trick skate and I thought I liked shorter but I'm starting to like longer is more fun with the right set ups..![20180625_060710|374x499](upload://ryX26mFTlisz9MgpIm2VS1JpgBH.jpg)

@Skunk I can't stop buying them..next i was thinking the spirit carbon...the black sidkick blink s2 mod has hit a wall full throttle 20mph weights at 18 did one and half back flip and didn't even chip the nose..they are strong as fuck..from there on I was like why these technology in the boards were not around when I was trick skating ..like the Powell flight technology a car can run over them they don't break..to be young dumb and full of cum again ..

I KNOW it ruthless ..but you pay for what you get @boogiewookie I payed 280 taxed to death by canada and I have to tell you  It's worth every penny when it hits a wall or curb when being cut off by a biker or car...or the friend or family member loses control falls and woods it into a curb on you ..like me ..lol....and still sitting there perfect..now that 100 buck board won't be  just turned onto a 200 plus buck board cause it has no nose ..and these boards are 100%water proof also..you can't beat them for a solid ass waterproof and curb proof e-sk8 build ..I've broken enough decks in my day ..I go for the toughest fucker around now that I'm done with wasting my hard earned money.. especially with eskate..they are not cheap to begin with even the junk diy china kits can be 700 bucks....your gonna spend a grand easy for a good set up..200 gonna stop you..it shouldn't if you want good stuff you have to pay.. just save and buy a piggy bank for your e-sk8 fund..just my 10 cents ..most advise is don't be shy to go a couple inch bigger then 30 you won't notice the couple inch but you will have a shit pile of more options on good quality decks to choose from and your wheel base will be much better for higher speeds unless your a good down hill racer and have lots of ankle control then rock the shorty.. cheers

I just tested the enclosure with inwards 6354 motors and the motor mounts are too close to the floor on 85mm caguamas, if I adjust the mounts to the top there is not enough clearance with the enclosure, so I thing moonshine enclosures will have to be modified before shipments.

It isss I've looked into buying one of the moonshines or the loaded boards just because of all the praise out here on this sub. I've actually never skateboarded in my life so yeah it'll be interesting to see how I do from 4 years of snowboarding. Especially because I'm a new boarder and all I would love a sturdy deck that's prone to hitting the curb, but don't you think there are diminished returns? I get how with a long board you'd get the added flex and the quality is on point in the $200 price point, but for a 30 something inch board you think it'd be worth spending the extra couple hundred on it? cause right now I'm at about $900 with the bare essentials I probably need a power switch ,a charger, etc. so it'd end up being $1000 anyway. 

Here is the spreadsheet if you'd look over it. maybe I should go for a couple inches longer than 30" I jus wanna be able to hold it by my side when I walk into a store yk.

what's the difference between dev.bustinboards.com and bustinboards.com dev.bustinboards seem to have lower prices and a lot more choice. I just looked at the Bustin Spliff what do you think of that one? It's 31" with 20" of wheelbase looks super nice too

Hey look guys, it's that deck that faboard "custom designed". Goes along nicely with their "custom removable battery" and "revolutionary belt drive system". Also did you know that the faboard was the first electric skateboard "designed" by a REAL skater?

Never tried a spliff, but I'm a fan of their boards for sure. Definitely looks like a good board to build on. As long as you can get a stiff one; flexy decks usually require a split enclosure.

it's 2" shorter than your old school deck with 5" more wheelbase with less kicktail. I heard it does have a little bit of flex cause it's a rocker. maybe it's not sucha good idea :confused:

 Your deck only had a 15 inch wheelbase what was your setup? it looks sleak af I'd like to know how you pulled it off. did you put a 10s2p lion? or lipos?

@brenternet  funny you mention the whole faboard thing because I am currently building a board with this deck and I started to think its looking like a faboard. the only difference between this deck and the faboards is that faboards is a bit more concave compared to the skateshred one which has almost none!

I have a lanyatchz pug boat 29 as my commuter but it only good like 20 25k not a performance board it's a acton S mod..can't stand it I want more for room and I like at least a 20 inch stance after riding my bigger diy boards..but they are heavy 18to 20pounds build with big 90 97mm five pound wheels and hubmotor and carvon direct drive ..and dual motots..big battery's to keep them running properly..its more of what you want..there is so many style and shape ..it what you prefer ..I'm kick tail I use to trick skate .but I have a falcon as my down hill slider board..very stable ..but not a push around or ride around city type board it super low no tail but it is amazing to push and foot brake but its like a bus for turning from the wedging and de wedging and being so low the sidewalk and curbs get you gotta pick it up..you can set up any deck you want like that to be a high speed streight liner and slider or a Carver and less high speed..now length is like a big rig or long bus like turning but smoother over bumps cracks handle speed much easier..ect..smaller is turns tighter like Austin mini but rough as fuck hit a bump at speed and your painting tarmac lines ...this is for you to find your style..now you can play with truck size..180mm is pretty much the biggest now for most real DH skate gear and stable if your a rider less carvey... 160mm now it's more carvy and the smaller you go for slolom style carvey as fuck trucks... 200mm hanger plus you can buy a clone of some sort there are some on this sites vendors or surfrodz..or maybe find a decade old DH truck..now for decks it's up to you really dude..this is your frame structure platform to build off of..your either gonna buy the cavalier with shit seats and hope you to see the next day racing it and have that broken back from the great seat in there..or you can get a caddilac ctsv be safe and so comfortable and saxy as fuck and be out riding the next day...this is the same as your skateboard DECK it your platforme your on it moving around using for transportation premium quality will never come cheap..I'm a performance car monstertruck two wheeled race quad guy and been skateboarding and snowboarding freestyle not pro by any means but I can ride but as a hobby for about 24 years..I'm 34..I just started esk8 this year fucking rush like drugs so just save dude save save save ..lol..now I don't want to be a dad but go push a skateboard around dude please.. practice around..get pads and helmet this is your life or someone elses life..... life is pricless....it's motorized.. its a bit like snowboarding but not really...you have to lean forward to fight the g force of the board but don't turn with the back ...main issue for speed wobble....you need ankle control and need to have balance. just pushing around and turning with your FRONT foot and learn how to foot break and not breaking your face off the payment because you can't do the one leg squat and lightly drag your foot to apply breaks while moving on popsicle stick with wheels and now a motor..there is no snow to slid on and no hard boot holding those ankles from flopping around from vibration and so on..totally different ball game e-sk8 to skatboarding and snowboarding I mixed both for my style each to there own..BUT ..foot breaking is key if you lose power or reception to remote or have shit breaks..  pushing at the start is key if you want to have less stress to you battery a drive line.and get and get more miles out of a pack..
Cheers sorry for the novel..just my 10cent good luck with hunt..check out landyatchz..kebec ..rayn.. zenit..all candian made premium boards with sector nine has some nice pro model deck

Dude I read the thread and I have many thoughts for you at this point. Not much time to elaborate at the moment lol.
It is a10s2p but I used 20650's that have a 30 a discharge so it doesn't sag much. Thanks for the comp, I'll do a build thread eventually ha.
A short deck is pretty squirrelly though and if your main concern is holding it, I can tell you from experience that the benefits of a bit larger deck way outweighs the benefits of a short deck. You'll get a way more satisfying and comforting feeling from a larger wheelbase. Will feel way more like you're snowboarding on something that's a bit longer and with some flex. If you're gonna spend North of a grand (which you will) you'll want something that you aren't scared to ride on lol. Those moonshine decks are absolutely beautiful. But yes they cost a mint. I found buying a used deck locally help mitigate some of that cost. Loaded makes some of the best feeling decks I've ever ridden. But there's many more manufacturers that make great decks too. Hell Bustin makes some great decks to build on that are pretty affordable. 
TL;DR First build go long and comfortable, second build go compact. Especially if you're new to pavement riding.

I'm 100%with @Lionpuncher..the longer the more the snowboarding feeling ..will be much easier for you to learn on....trust me  I'm use to small decks I'm small at 5.6..145 pounds I'm lil girl built man..I would Carrie my 40 everywhere if I could Carrie 20 pounds all day ..the length don't bother its the weight...weight is what will make your board agile to Carry around ..my 34 moonshine I can carry from rear truck arm relaxed hanging just like my 29 landyatchz from the front truck 5inch difference..it's the weight 29 landyatchz 9 pound single drive to the 34 moonshine 18 pound duel or the 40 moonshine carvon SDR 20pounds...30 to 34 is nothing in length but a shit pile of stability and more just more fun as I'm learning.. and you have real deck to chose from.. loaded are very very nice super light with the cork..and that cork take a lot of vibration out by the way..I'm gonna build a loaded poke one day..don't skimp on the board my friend ..check out Powell they build serious stuff also....also search used site like lionpuncher said ..I have found lots of rayne and loaded and lanyatchz for sale full completes in Canada if your in the states south where it warm  most of the year you should find tones on Craig's list..?.we have Kijiji....I was just thinking also I'm getting a really nice carbon board with built in enclosures from @Jaraya92881 called the phantom .maybe you can jump on that if he has any left... give him

wow that was an amazing post dude thanks a lot I got a lot to work with now. I mean this thing is a project and an expensive one nonetheless I wanna be spending my money wisely and I definitely agree the deck has been the hardest decision I had to make. There's jus so many options but at the same time I need something for eskates so I gotta think about the wheelbase. It's been stressful to the point I made this post to try to get some suggestions and I'm so glad I did. I definitely agree with you I should start off with regular states before I even think about riding a motorized one. for that I'll use bustin's longboards. They're good quality with a good price, so I figure it'd be best if I chose a board from them to build with. But for a real build I think I might take think more about what I want. maybe a loaded poke or the phantom or even the carbon fiber phantom deck. Having that enclosure built in is slick and very useful. I gotta find what I like first and in order to do that I'll jus buy a regular skateboard from bustin to start lol

Dude you guys  @Frenchy and @Lionpuncher helped me out a lot with this deck choosing I can't thank you guys enough. I just bought the Bustin sportster with the caliber II trucks I can't wait for it to come so I can practice in a parking lot getting the basics down with the foot breaking. I wanna get good fast I should probably invest in some vans as well. I'll let you guys know when I have any questions! Thanks a lot

Fyi foot braking will eat shoes FAST. I used to take shoe goo and old bike tire rubber to repair the bottom of my breaking foot when I did downhill daily. 
I always had one shoe that looked new and one that was hammered.  And my legs felt like they were different lengths lol

@Skunk is so  right..lol ..at least when I trick skated I had some what matching holy bastards  a foot sole gone or flapping around  in one from pushing and braking and my toes hanging out the other from doing flip tricks..vans foot braking shoes and gummies soles are great if you can find some and shoe goo is a major player in the skate world..
