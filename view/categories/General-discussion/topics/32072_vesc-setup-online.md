I dont mind breaking cracking setting fire to batterys any thing but killing my vesc ,its easy to get mounts,batterys,lipo anyway,trucks, remotes,bms....but waiting on Vesc,focbox to ship is a killer

what i want to know are any of the top Vesc lads doing payed setups,log into pc  and set up for u 
i know they cant see the board but they can hear it and see the setting you would tell them what batterys  and motor you have ...
I would be happy to pay a good lad to log in and set up my Focbox...
10 years ago i was a computer tec guy doing logins and fixing and setting up stuff ,now u might say i should be good at Vesc setup but im not....I cant get my head around it why i dont know why..

This has been thought about before. It's been talked about to do setups via Skype but nothing's really come of it because it's just a bit tricky.

Try vesc setup tutorials on you tube.  At least you're in the right place to learn about the vesc. im like you, didnt know anything about the vesc and was nervous  to even connect it to my first build. oh, and the bldc tool was scary at first. i did about a week of reading here and watched lots of videos over and over but the best info i received was here, i just kept asking for help and so many people shared their knowledge with me. **The main thing is be patient, ask for help and do the research here and read, slowly but surely you will learn how to setup the vesc and focbox. Good luck.**
