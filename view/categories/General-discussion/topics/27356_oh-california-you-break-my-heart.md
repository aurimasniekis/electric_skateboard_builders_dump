specifically calls out electric skateboards :-(

That sucks on the plus side it's some sort of recognition I guess, also at least it's not exclusively prohibiting eskateboards :expressionless:  Looks like a nice trail.

State of california has fully legalized electric skateboards. "electrically motorized boards" and "motorized skateboards" are 2 different things in law. Going 20mph with a helmet is legal.

-I was wondering the same thing... do electric boards count as "motorized" or are they referring to "gas powered" skateboards?

For CA, they make a legal distinction between "motorized skateboard" and "electric skateboard". However both gas and electric qualify to be "motorized skateboard". If the board goes over 20mph or has motors over 1000w or hits a certain size limit, it'll be classified a "motorized skateboard" and would be illegal nearly everywhere public. Boards that fall within those limitations are still considered "electric skateboards" and are legal pretty much everywhere bikes are allowed.

That's good to know - do you have any idea what the size limits are?

> 313.5. An “electrically motorized board” is any wheeled device that has a floorboard designed to be stood upon when riding that is not greater than 60 inches deep and 18 inches wide, is designed to transport only one person, and has an electric propulsion system averaging less than 1,000 watts, the maximum speed of which, when powered solely by a propulsion system on a paved level surface, is no more than 20 miles per hour. The device may be designed to also be powered by human propulsion.

It would be interesting to see someone build a 60 x 18 deck :laughing:

This also technically makes nearly all popular commercial boards illegal due to the watt limit, but no one's going around measuring wattage while riding to prove it. Also iffy on what "average wattage" means.

5 feet?  that's a lot of leeway.  I suspect I'll have to carry the text of that bill in my wallet when I'm riding.

Thanks for the citation, @Jinra

Thx @Jinra! I wonder if police are receiving training in identifying wattage? I'm so interested in how CA handles all this because I'm sure they will be a model for other states in the future. 

In practice/reality, Can folks use an eSK8 in a "no motorized boards" area if you remain below 20MPH and are respectful of others on a trail? (even if your wattage exceeds that 1000w threshold)? @DougM did you ride the trail?

@NAF Yea no one really cares. I'm curious on what "average wattage" is though. If you have a 2000w motor and a 1w motor on there, would that mean you have an "average wattage" of 1000w?

The trail was in Monterey - probably the Monterey Bay Coastal Trail.  It looked like great riding - really wide, not a lot of people on it. 

Sadly I didn't have the board with me.

I was riding on the road in the middle of the night and got pulled over by police in Cali. They tried to scare me by saying "have you ever been to jail before," After they just told me to put on some damn lights and were impressed when I told them it does 30+mph and let me go with a warning I guess

If you look at the text for individual code, they're not really targeting Esk8 but pretty much any form of transportation except bikes on this trail (CVC 21207.5; CVC 23127, MCC 22-12.5), even manual skateboard (MCC 22-14)

Except California Vehicle Code **21968** - basically says no motorized skateboard, but Electrically Motorized Board is NOT a motorized board (CVC 313.5): this is targeting old school gas powered board as it is written in 1959 and was amended 2016

If it's talking about average wattage then pretty much all eskates should be fine, unless you're mountain boarding I doubt anyone uses more than 1000w on average the majority of the time

If it's "how much you use" it'd be unenforceable. Pretty sure they're talking about the rating of the motor itself.

The rating you see on motor is kinda arbritrary to some extent, I think theyre generally more their peak rating anyway I think. 

Even if you had a pair of motors rated at 3000W each, if your battery is limited to 36V*40A=1440W, as an example, then i doubt your motors would be using more than even half that in total most of the time :)

It's unpractical to measure which is why law would probably go by printed specs rather than actual testing.

You could well be right, but based on the way the law looks to be written, I don't think it'd be very hard to contest them using the rating of the motor if it got to that point considering the power measurement software available for the VESC as well as the fact that they talk about the overall propulsion system as opposed to the specific motor rating :)

From CVC 21968

'VEHICLE CODE - VEH
DIVISION 11. RULES OF THE ROAD [21000 - 23336]  ( Division 11 enacted by Stats. 1959, Ch. 3. )  

CHAPTER 5. Pedestrians’ Rights and Duties [21949 - 21971]  ( Chapter 5 enacted by Stats. 1959, Ch. 3. )
  
21968.  
(a) A motorized skateboard shall not be propelled on any sidewalk, roadway, or any other part of a highway or on any bikeway, bicycle path or trail, equestrian trail, or hiking or recreational trail.
(b) For purposes of this section, an electrically motorized board, as defined in Section 313.5, is not a motorized skateboard.
(Amended by Stats. 2015, Ch. 777, Sec. 6. Effective January 1, 2016.)'

The sign's old. You can use an electric skateboard on this path.

We should find the person who put this in the law:

"(b) For purposes of this section, an electrically motorized board, as defined in Section 313.5, is not a motorized skateboard."

and buy him or her beer!
