![20190417_095638|281x500](upload://sWaMCkcCKGxWs0K5rxpt5es0JgF.jpeg)

So I often pick up the rear end of my board by the metal crossbars. They're sharp AF and I want a solution. 

1. My first thought was heat shrink but the crossbars don't have an open end to slide over

2. Second thought was electrical tape but I feel like there is something better

3. Maybe a wrap around heat shrink tape or a paint on rubber? 

Anybody got any ideas for me?

I put paracord on EVERYTHING and its worlds better!  Car steering wheel, board handles and trucks, backpack, baseball bat...really good feel even when hot and wet

Why not lift it from the front? Does the back cage hit the ground?

I agree paracord is a good looking and inexpensive way to put a nice grip on the crossbars!

I agree that Paracord will look cool for a minute but it's gonna soak up road gtime and the 1st time you get it wet it'll be gross forever. You could btush it with epoxy prolly. 

Maybe take the guard off and use a sanding flap wheel on the sharp edges?

Dude. Plasti dip. Would look clean.  Easy to replace , remove,  and apply. Can pick lots of different colors.

Yeah just barely.

Lots of good ideas here guys. Great work. 

Color options is a big plus too. I might try and 3d print a handle that bolts on first. We shall see :smiling_imp:

File the edges so they aren't sharp and put this on it.

What about that rubberized stuff like on Allen keys and other tools used as grip? Dip the crossbars in a vat of that stuff of you preferred color and off you go. Dunno how economical that is I have never considered it before.

Just unbolt one of the crossbars and slide it over. Just got to get the right diameter tubing. I'm kind of interested to try this myself. I also have cans of the spray Plasti Dip and if I can find some time, I'll try to spray a cross bar or two for science.

That's exactly what I have in mind. I just need to find what it's called haha. @skunk nevermind lol it's plastic dip

@Mobutusan I guess I could cover the entire crossbar.. I hadn't considered that. I was meaning the in between (middle) section.

:point_up:

This, easiest and cleanest solution.

You could also do it with a file or some sand paper.

Right.. It's a whole other struggle to decide and then find colors. They do have a clear in the tool dip to extra complicate

@Deckoz @Sn4pz   that will probably not work with this mounts as you need the right angle to make the pullbar fit and not hit the motors. ask me from where i know it :sweat_smile:

Edit: plus the fact that he drives some old mbs trucks and no trampa trucks.

@venom121212 maybe something like this

Itâ€™s a bit thicker kind of heat shrink used for tennis rackets and you can get it in different colors and sizes.

How wide are the crossbars? I wonder if one of these would bolt cleanly. Might be too big and stick out weird.

Why? :thinking:

Personally I would not carry or lift  it this way and stress the motor mounts/crossbars.

If the mounts and crossbars bend from that, they would have bent from normal use someday. Better it happens towing the board around than riding it I would say.

Good point, I just want to understand the reason or the situation when @venom121212 does it.

I only lift the rear of my MTB (on the hanger) when I have a walk of shame home because of empty battery :laughing:. Apart from that I never lift the rear. If it's for carrying only there are better solutions. Carrying my MTB with one hand is much easier compared to my street build.

I use this, drilled through deck and just carry it. Very comfy

Could also cary this around and tie it on when you're walking:

I have to make a few super tight turns when going to the gym or other buildings. If I lift by the front, the crossbars just barely scrape the ground. It's not often that I have to pick it up :wink:
