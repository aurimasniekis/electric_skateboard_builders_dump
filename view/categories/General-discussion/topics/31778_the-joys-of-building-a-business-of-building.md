Oh man I can kind of feel for you.. except when USPS looses my package it only costs a few hundred at most and not a few thousand. 

Did you insure the bad boy? I do that all of my packages now. There‚Äôs was also a nifty little GPS tracker that only costs $5 that I plan on using if I have to shipped higher priced items. It was on Kickstarter a while ago so I‚Äôm waiting on the release.

i need those trackers. That's an excellent idea. I'm not sure what the insurance covers exactly, but the contigency is to build another one, which i can do. But it will have to wait until more of my motors come in, and my new branded mounts.. shit he's going to get an upgrade out of this isn't he... 

I think @nate stole his own board from the fedex ship center after i dropped it off. He's always trying to get upgrades out of me.

How about this for a deal, I'll send you an R2 drive train, battery and trucks with wheels. 

Basically an R2 without the deck....

Then you can build a LHBR2 hybrid on a custom deck to Nate's liking. 

I think Nate will be happy with the power.

Deal?

 @onloop If Nate accepts. then yes. 

His was an AWD monster so i'll need 4 hubs. I can match the motor controllers, i have VESC-Xs for days, and i can supply the pack. 

What do you think @Nate ? 4 Raptor hubs on an LHB deck with a 12S5P 30Q pack?

If i find your other kid i'll just keep it if you jump on this.

way to step up Jason. I like this idea of combining forces for the ultimate esk8 that makes some dude smile so hard his face falls off.

This is not a 4wd though. Just R2 minus deck.

You only need to make the deck and find a nice way to integrate it into the Raptor power chassis and drive train.

I know bro, I tried it at the nyc meet up. It's a pretty good board. Wish it wasn't on FOC though, the start up was somewhat stale compared to the Raptor 1 but it's such a nice ride afterward, torque is miles ahead of the other competition especially the Inboard M1.

Edit: I think @JohnnyMeduse mentioned he's not sure if it's not on r-spec drive? Maybe it's on beginners mode not sure. But if it is, then the Ghost drive is monstrous.

Man that sucks!!! It's happened to me a few times with USPS. I'm sure they flat out stole my shit 2 of those times. As I had dead tracking numbers after I dropped my packages at the post office counter. Now, if it's too much to lose I always put it in there hand while glaring into their eyes and I always demand a receipt. Oh! And all of my claims and appeals for all lost items were denied.

Good luck Brotha.

Well winter is coming (get it?) so I think we'll have a while until the roads here is good enough, maybe a few months? 

Regardless, people were clamoring to test out that AWD and if they hear @onloop Ghost drive is gonna be on a hybrid along with LHB motors they'll be jumping in lines to try it out.....I should think about charging to try it. 

I'm gonna get all the esk8 YouTubers to test this baby out, I'm gonna be so cool like driving a Ferrari üòé

@longhairedboy ohhh man I am sorry about the mix up. Maybe you can post a pic here of the missing build so that we can all keep a lookout for it. 

I mean honestly, does a thief think our squad is going to let an LHB original go unaccounted for? Into the hands of some soul-less degenerate?! 

No way! At some point a picture or craigslist sale will surface. We'll find it! 

Although I'll admit that now I'm hoping it doesnt surface until you build the @onloop hybrid with 1.21 jigawatts.

I just need the pack and @Nate gets his replacement board. As soon as i have the cash i can  buy the cells.

after talking to every manager on every level, i eventually realized i was just never going to see his board again. 

Since then i have about a dozen emails out to various people trying to figure out a GPS solution that would allow for more direct theft recovery during the delivery process. Once i find the right solution, i will drive my happy ass to the board's location and personally curb stomp the twat snorkling lickspittle that stole it from my customer. 

Insurance is horse shit. Signatures are horse shit. None of that helps when a corporation can side channel a box into an employees car somewhere and lose all record of it. 

More direct methods are needed.

Don't know how well this actually works in practice but a podcast I listen to advertises for these things all the time (Leo Laporte)

https://secure.thetrackr.com/

Pretty sure it depends on enough people running the trackr app in the area where your thing ends up for it to ping out its location to their system but it is a low power relatively cheap GPS solution otherwise I think you need something with cell connection which is going to jack the price up.

These are the cheapest things I've seen for "easy" DIY IoT stuff let me know if you find something better or cheaper https://store.particle.io/collections/electron I've only used the photon (wifi) one but basically programming it like an arduino but uses a web interface and sends your code up to a server to compile then sends it to your device over the interwebs, it's interesting:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RTrC0jM-hg

^^ I ported some frogger code from JS to C++ and managed to get it running on there and used an app on my phone with buttons to fire the web calls that control the frog (using photon's API for getting messages to it from the phone app/web calls)  They don't have GPS I don't think but cell or wifi options and like I said dumb simple to program (can always add GPS module if they don't have one with it).

gps data sent via web api would be ideal, i could receive the data directly to a web app and not involve a third party and display it locally using maps on my phone. All i need is a data plan that all the devices can use. HMMMMMMM

I'll bet I'm not the only one who hopes @onloop will offer R2 diy kits for sale.

yeah might be able to get something like a ting SIM and only activate data on the service it's like $6 a month for the line plus whatever data, not sure if you can use multiple devices on the same account and activate and deactivate them but seems like it should be possible.  Maybe offer customers some sort of deal for putting the device in a return envelope when they receive their board :) Or maybe better they can keep it in there and get access to data tracking their board for a fee to keep the data active, extra security feature for extreme specialty boards where it might be worth it.

I can make this happen... I'm not sure how threatening that's going to sound coming out of a piezo speaker though

@longhairedboy @Nate

I thought we sent you a battery? You could simply screw our stuff to a LHB deck and Nate would be back in action with a LHB Raptor 2.

He's getting a 12S5P. I'm using your focboxes, my focboxes, your hubs and my motors and your a few other things. But i have to use his original sized pack which means one of my boxes. 

It's going to be insane. Your hubs on the back and my belts on the front. 

Also i really, really appreciate, again i'm saying it, you chipping in on this. 

The rest of the sled will not go to waste, i promise. I'm going to do something very special with it as an homage to our mutual growth and partnership throughout the last few years in building this community.

Dang that sucks for @nate but god damn @longhairedboy and @onloop that is awesome what u guys did and please Jason sell those hubs for us please. I bet a couple of us are dying for them u should come out with them like 2-3 weeks before Christmas because then when people are getting Christmas deals they come across the hubs and buy them not knowing how beast they are and then there Board becomes a crazy amazing board all on cheap Christmas deals lol
But please sell them before Xmas
We would love it
