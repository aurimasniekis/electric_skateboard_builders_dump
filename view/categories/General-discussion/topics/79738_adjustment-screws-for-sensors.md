Hello guys,

This is not really a esk8 related topic but since some people are good at engineering I'm asking.


Does anyone knows where to find adjustement bolts? It basicaly combines a nylstop nut and a ball joint.

Something that can be used to adjust camera angle, beam direction, sensor angle etc...

I am not looking for an amazon link or some chinese reseler but an actual manufacturer like southco or Araymond. 

Thanks,

Here is an exemple of what I mean :
