Anyone got any ideas? would love to combine my two hobbies by cutting some beer glass shapes or something similar.

I have no idea where to start, do people get them laser cut?

Lost of maker places have laser cutter, grip tape cuts with a laser easy. Or you can use a razor knife. I typically cut a stencil in vinyl and go from there.

It won't pierce the grip, I can't figure out the right settings I guess.

That’s a big part of it is tweaking the settings a bit @mmaner. There’s a blade that you can buy it’s a little sharper as well. I want to say it’s a German cutting blade but I’ll have to look when I get back to the house

maybe clear grip over a large beer decal or many small decals logos would look refreshing :beer::beers:

Hey @mmaner it’s a ceramic blade. They are in theory more resistant to dulling. Sorry for the delay getting back to ya.

Give this a shot and see if it helps: 
Set the speed up to something in the 450-500 mm/sec range. Depth to 10 mil and test a small part
