So I'm sure at least a bunch of you have gone through this-- you have a dope build. Your friends wanna try but you really want to be able to ride with your friends. I'm thinking I gotta build a guest/wife board now that I've gone through the process. I'd like to get away with a budget build for this one-- maybe lipos, TB vescs and one of these 63mm motor group buys. So-- who's done a bms on lipos on here? And can anyone reco a good cheap eBay deck seller?

Here we go again.
