I saw a lot of talk about a Vegas convention in 2018 hope it went off well. 
I would like to propose a Esk8 convention in Northern California. After reading the posts of the last one in Vegas it seemed a lot of work for one person. I would like to form a committee of people that live in No. Calif. Preferably in the Bay Area (you know who you are) but i'm not against the Sacramento area, That area has much more land and may be a bit more laxed about a bunch of skateboarders invading their town.
If we can split up the different task and responsibilities we may be able to pull it off. As of right now if you interested in helping PM me and if you were involved in the Vegas get together I would like to hear some of the issues you encountered and the triumphs you achieved.
Once we have some brave folks who want to step up than we can set up a meeting place and decide exactly what we would like the weekend to include. 
Thanks for your time.![hey-bud-lets-party|400x300](upload://44HJCNmmUcwzGGoJvWf7LY0QecR.jpeg)

wheels are already in motion.  if you'd like to help out let @Michaelinvegas know.

im sure norcal would be awesome.  but so would nyc, dc, orlando, austin, denver, san diego, portland, et al ad infinitum.  and those who committed to the last renegade event kinda get dibs on volunteering locations for the next one.  not to say that peeps here dont have a say.  but its important to participate if you want to help set the agenda.  

at the same time there us nothing preventing you from holding an event.  i highly encourage you to do so!  building community is a huge part of our future, and riding in groups is awesome!

Please start having chats with @okp also @LazyRolling. I have had various chats with them since the Renegade Weekend... we are in touch with each other to move esk8 to a different level.....

So, let them know you exist. Be active in the community. Your one part could be the part that pushes esk8 to the level we think it needs to be.

@Aeromech787 The only problem is that the community in Europe is pretty widespread. There are some guys from Germany, Austria (like me :slight_smile:), Uk and so on. :smile:

Yeah UK is pretty well covered, but if I'm heading to maybe London it's not all that hard to keep going and be in say France WITH my board :)

@okp and his movies have sold me on an eSk8 trip to Paris - would be excellent to combine with a Europe Meetup :smile:

Plus, traveling within the EU is just as bad as within diferen States. Just think how far vegas is from NY

Northern California? There's already BAEK8 with like 30-50 riders all the time? Maybe they would would be able to shine some light. @sofu? 

I'm planning to go to the 2019 Renegade in Colorado and also 2020 Florida. Australia would be expensive especially for families like me...no way my wife would let me do international travels without her (I never cared much for traveling, but for esk8, it's worth it). She's super excited about Paris and Sweden in the future.

@Blitz @bevilacqua the other Europe eSk8 location I've been considering for a trip is Switzerland... more train hours but 'bucket list' downhill routes :wink:

EDIT: more I think about the cooler this sounds Europe eSK8 road trip 2019 done in the style of Thasher's King Of The Road :):laughing:

BAEsk8 would love to host some sort of convention! We've certainly got plenty of warehouses where conventions can be held and crazy routes to test boards to the extreme ;) For example where the Bay Area Makerfaire was held, and the ocean side route for extreme uphill and downhill

Having participated in the Vegas trip, there's a few things I think that everyone planning should remember.

- Try to get permits if possible! It was a bummer cutting Saturday short because of some complaints to the cops. They close streets in SF like every weekend for marathons. Surely, we can get permits somewhere in the US.

- When doing street runs, double check there's no event's going on that might block our path. And in case something happens un-predictable (a car flips over and blocks all lanes or something), be ready with a backup plan

- Megaphone or some loud speaker to queue up riders when racing would speed up the process. Racing was very slow. Maybe a smaller course, or starting races one after another before the last one finished.

- Have plan in place for when (not if) someone get's hurt. While I think Michael and everyone dealt with this in vegas very well (and it's great we have trained medical professionals riding with us for this reason), It was a little bit chaotic and a plan ahead of time couldn't hurt!

- Get more people involved in planning. Micheal did one hell of a job planning this. But I there's a lot of work to do this all for one guy. Multiple people working together would be better.

- Get the big generator from the start! We will all combined draw a lot of power (especially my tesla brick charger charging at 12amps, haha). Even without my board plugged in, I think we could only do about 6 boards at once on the small generator. I think some math and estimates would help guide what size we really need for an event like this.

These are the main points that stick out in my mind as to where I see improvement.

Now, the things I did see right about Vegas:

Honestly, there's too many to list, but I'll try to hit some of the big ones I see:

- Good hotel in a good location for most of the riders to stay at.

- Lots of different types of activities, from poker run, to group rides, to races, to trail riding, to getting food together. We all enjoy one of these more than others, so the wide variety is great to please everyone.

- Food for lunch at the event provided by the organizer. And not shitty fast food or something, but good food and a variety of it for everyone to find something they can eat. We have a limited amount of time for an event like this, and getting food is one of the more time consuming parts when everyone splits up to eat. Could be 3 hours for a meal before we were ready to meet up again. Getting this together allowed us all to ride together longer.

- Light bands for the night sesh (Thanks Lazy Rollers). This was killer, as not everyone was ready with light (me included). Safety is important in a big group like this. I think having this for the next event (assuming there's night riding) for those who didn't come to vegas would be great.

- Good quality trails. Everything we rode was top notch. We can't rely on just a parking lot or the streets 100% of the time.

- Take care of the community around us. For example, we stopped at some lot for the last place in the poker run. Security showed up, and I believe it was josh that brought them drinks. This kind of behavior is a great way to mend the relationship between the eskate and non eskate communities.

- General teamwork. Helping each other get boards packed and shipped, dragging each other when boards died, onsite focbox troubleshooting from the engineers themselves (haha, that was epic), board storage (thanks @JohnnyMeduse). I didn't see any fighting or arguing, everyone worked together to have a good weekend. (minus Ernesto's frustration)

There's so many other things that were one well that I skipped over that aren't coming to mind right now.
I have to say, what an amazing start, thank you @Michaelinvegas for your hard work. These are my notes about the event and hope we can combine our notes together as a community to build even better events!

I down to help anyway possible in the future.

Depending on where in Colorado, I work @ Dave and Busters and I'm sure we could get a deal for catering. Maybe closer to the date I could get a rough guesstamit on people and see what can be done.

Right now we all have to think we have a open blue sky.... ideas will be abundant 

We take them all in consideration and start focusing on the what we want the event(s) to accomplish.  Not all gatherings need to be carbon copies of one another.

We are a group that thinks outside the box. I expect the ideas and suggestions to reflect that.

I didn't take a count in vegas of how many of us were riding pneumatics vs street wheels. But I'd guess it was around 50/50. I think having a vairiety of options is great. For example, some of us split up and went to the strip for a ride. Some of us didn't want to ride the strip. It's good to have a mix of options though so everyone can ride something.

Part of the point of rallying everyone. Need to build back up those connections and strengthen them within each core group. Those are the ones that will help push esk8 in 2019
