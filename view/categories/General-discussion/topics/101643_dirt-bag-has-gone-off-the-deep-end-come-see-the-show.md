I will not discuss this any more with you. The issue was resolved. Lies about what happened were told and it is being dealt with in a legal manner. The mods on the other forum have straight up been black mailing me as well. 2 moderators i will not name right now are currently under investigation by discourse for a very real crime. They abused power to lie and slander. You will see within the next few days when this goes fully public. Right now i am gathering allies and keeping my cards close. Dont trust what you see is all i am saying

You can, but i personally wont yet. Discourse has asked that while this is ongoing, it needs to be kept internal. You and i both know you were not the biggest problem of the 2 mods that have done this. All i ask is that it remains internal for now, afterall it will save drama. 


Also, it is against the rules to post private messages without all parties consent, or or in this case discourses consent i assume

@Dirt_Bag

You're posting this on a forum that was physically proven to censor and abide by a sole companies rules/objectives? Are you really this out of touch? I want your weed hookup either way. 

You should just post your proof of this bullshit or leave it alone. Unless attention or saving face is this much of a thing to you. There is absolutely no discourse police/legal team for these types of things. And if you really saught legal advice, you wouldn't have posted this here considering the first thing they wouldve told you is "Don't dummy."

They have literally broken real world laws, as well as the rules set by damon or whoever it is that set them. They are an unchecked power that removes what they dont like. This is not new. Its painfully obvious

Anything more than blanket statements would help. If any laws were broken, why are you talking about it without even showing basic proof? Seems like you've already condemned yourself to these discourse police that don't even exist. We (our community) might be able to help in some way. 

Only one question. Or two. Why is this happening? And what do you want the outcome to be?

I can answer some of that.  It's happening because we asked him for info about the complaints regarding his battery packs.  He immediately got defensive, so we silenced him so he couldn't use esk8,news to sell until the issues were resolved.  This was for the sole reason of protecting users from a seller that may or may not be selling dangerous battery packs.  As far as I know, all he has to do is cooperate and his status will be reinstated assuming all of the claims are resolved or proven untrue.

You will also notice that while he's supplying all this "proof", he won't be showing anything that proves that he took care of the poor guy who was sent a battery with the polarity reversed, which promptly blew his vescs. You might remember that thread, because another member of this forum took a look at that battery and was shocked by how poorly it was made.

Instead of taking responsibility for the issue, Dirt_Bag claimed it was built by an "employee" who was "fired." Yes, LongHairedBoy builds all of his own batteries but Dirt_Bag had an employee. 

He will claim he can't talk about it because there's "an ongoing court case" in the matter or some other implausible smokescreen to cover up the fact that he sent a dangerous item, then ghosted the buyer and all but disappeared from the forums while the literal smoke cleared.

That guy and the safety of every other prospective buyer is the central issue here, not the victimization fantasies of Dirt_Bag.

Here's some truth for ya dude.  You messed up, you sold some crappy packs.  Instead of owning it and fixing the issue, you lied about it.  When we called you on it you got defensive because you knew you were caught.  Not you're trying this straw man thing, you have proved nothing, out and out lied about illegalities and the discourse police, and they aren't even good lies.

It is in fact laughable how silly all this is, but good luck to you.  You might wanna find a job other than battery building and/or fiction, as you suck at both.

Oh no, Dirt_Bag. The Discourse Police asked you not to post screenshots and yet you did it anyway. Will this damage the pending investigation?

[quote="Dirt_Bag, post:7, topic:101643, full:true"]
You can, but i personally wont yet. Discourse has asked that while this is ongoing, it needs to be kept internal. You and i both know you were not the biggest problem of the 2 mods that have done this. All i ask is that it remains internal for now, afterall it will save drama.

Also, it is against the rules to post private messages without all parties consent, or or in this case discourses consent i assume

Because nothing is incriminating. This just looks terrible on you. 

The community mods & leaders have every right to be looking out for inexperienced, unqualified people selling dangerous batteries.

Which you did, in case you forgot.

_You sold a dangerous battery._

So maybe I'm just too stoned right now. But I still didn't see anything illegal going on? But maybe that's just me being an adult and thinking accordingly.

@Dirt_Bag
I may know what happened now. I've been in the same situation before. It was this one time that I decided to silently cum inside my friend while having sex with her instead of screaming "Hold on to your Horses Lady!!!" The next morning she told me that I need to pay the $50 for the "morning after pill". I was pissed and told her that it's a mutual transaction and to fuck off. Then she told all my friends. I didn't want any part of it so I told them that she fucked me while I was drunk and passed out. You might be drunk and passed out.

Moral of the story. Battery life is crazy sometime eh...

Look man, I don't see any foul intent or illegalities from Mr. Gordon or Maner on this subject. They're doing their due part looking out for the community. 

I ordered a battery from you when you first started selling packs. It's been almost 3 months now and I understand that it can take a while with cell shipping and only working on packs part time + real life things but it has been a while. I'd be more than happy to see a picture of what you have done since you said cells arrived 20 days ago. I thought you might redeem yourself after delivering good packs to waiting customers but looks like there's no more future for you and the forums at the moment.

Just so you are aware, none of the adults in the room are buying any of this. Anyone with the most basic understanding of our legal system knows that things don't work at all like this, and certainly don't move this fast. This shows all your cards.

Nobody cares this much about your "business" that you've sold like 4 batteries out of. Hopefully only 4.

Man, this is all just really sad to me.  I can see this thing escalating from both sides honestly.  That message between @BillGordon and @KaramQ was sort of weird, like you guys were sort ofpressuring him when he was just like "Hey man I like @Dirt_Bag and he's been super helpful to me".  IDK, it's all really sad because like, I really like this community - there are 2 forums for us builders to nerd out and feel supported in our niche little hobby, JIUST 2.  THAT'S IT.  @Dirt_Bag seems like he's been around for a while and I also have had nothing but good interactions with him.  I bought some ESC's for a really good price from him, they arrived promptly, and he was transparent about a capacitor issue on one of them.  IDK what the deal is with him not disclosing the details about that battery pack, but I just want to say it makes me sad to see him go.  We need to support each other guys, please I do hope you guys can resolve this.  :pray::pray::pray:

the general elitism is out of control as well. theirs a massive amount of hostility towards new comers. i never thought i would say this, but the eboard subreddit is a kinder place than either of these now.
