Would anyone be interested in having a group buy for A123 25650 cells for $7 per cell plus shipping?

**If you are, enter your order here:** http://goo.gl/forms/VCZ4oOOWLx03OimD2 (You can edit your details after)

They are usually $12 per cell but with the group buy of 100, they will only be $7 plus shipping. 

**Spec sheet:** http://goo.gl/ikxejT


These are the same cells that Boosted uses and they make for a pretty nice battery pack in a 12s1p configuration. Small but still powerful. The voltage discharge/sag is also more stable. The recharge cycles are around 1000 which is more than double that of regular Lithium Ion cells. 
**Here's a nice build for example:** http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/a2esk8-mini-cruiser-30-carbon-fiber-deck-single-carvon-v2-hub-motor-12s1p-lifepo4-vesc/5543/12

How many cells do you need to make 12s? 12?

voltage ? capacity ? weight ?

Yeah. 12s means 12 cells end to end ("series", thus the "s"). The 1p means 1 row of them. In 12s2p, 2p means 12 sets of 2 cells next to each other (24 total cells). 12s3p would be 12 sets of 3 cells next to each other (36 total) and so on

I assume you mean how many cells to get to a regular lithium ion 12s voltage.

Nominal voltage for each cell is 3.2 so around 13-14 cells. That would make for an easy battery pack build however.

Yeah I think... Shipping batteries via air is annoying. Usually via ground is allowed domestically within the USA. I should be able to sort things out for small quantities of batteries. I'll update you if I can or not.

@Pantologist Did you ever go ahead with the group by? I'm surprise there wasn't more interest considering these cells are good for 1000+ cycles and allow for 70A continuous discharge.

Nope. I think one person filled out the sheet. 

That one person was me. 

Yeah I used a pack of these. Great cells. I am going to make another pack soon. I am trying to design a 3D printable design so that you can spot weld the cells together and have a safe battery housing to fit them in. It would prevent short circuits and would be it more user friendly and tidy. 

Here's a glimpse of a few designs

Yeah they were bought out by some large Chinese company. I don't think manufacturing facilities changed...

I doubt it is an issue with the batteries alone since it was bought out a few years ago. I'm guessing there is an issue with the BMS or there is a manufacturing defect or error in assembling the battery packs.

They are using a 50v charger now... if the BMS does not cut off the voltage at 43.2v, they will be overcharging cells... after awhile that will lead to damage.

That's a bummer! Those enclosure designs are super nicely done.

At the moment I'm deciding whether to go 12S1P A123 26650 or 10S2P 18650 (30A discharge capable cells). The latter will give more range but the 12S1P setup is so nice and compact. The 10S2P setup will be bigger and require more soldering, assembling etc.

Have you ever considered using 18650s instead of 26650s? What swayed your decision to go the 26650 route?

EDIT: What is the real-world range of your 12S1P 26650 pack?

Cheers

Boosted uses 12S1P A123s, so Boosted specs should apply. I got about 5-7 miles with my Boosted before I returned it and went DIY.

The A123 cells are safer but heavier. That's the trade off. They also have great continuous discharge ratings so voltage sag is minimal.

I got around 5 miles. I'm pretty fat at 180lb.

@Pantologist think we could gauge interest on another group buy for these i already know someone who could be interested in another 12 for a 12s2p and the same goes for me so that is already 24 cells! Thanks!

The reason I got it so cheap was because the wing with the mounting holes cracked when the user overtightened it and basically sold it as is because Boosted determined he installed it incorrectly. 

Should I make a teardown video? No one seems to have opened an extended range yet. I'm curious.

Definitely 18650s in here. They seem to be wrapped with white covers so I can't even identify the cells. Boosted is also now using an enclosed plastic cell holder. It is like glued in there with no apparent screws. I wish they designed these for easier repairs. The cover was easier to pry off then a V1's battery.

They're not by chance using the A123 1.1ah 18650 lifepo4 cell are they? 

https://www.batteryspace.com/a123-system-nanophosphate-lifepo4-18650-rechargeable-cell-3.2v-1100mah.aspx

I'm looking into using a 12s4p setup of these cells for a clone boosted board, it'd be nice reassurance to know the cell is trusted by BB.

Edit: It also looks like they're using a compression pack as oppose to welding strips.

Damn that is a really expensive cell for very little capacity...  Good thing about these though is you can run them at 14s since they're nominal voltage is lower.  I am pretty sure you can get the 26650 version of these for the same price and they have much more capacity and higher amps.

They have 2500mAh @70A so they are 8.25Wh, compared to 1100mAh @ 30A and 3.52Wh for the 18650 version.

Direct from the manufacturer:

https://www.buya123products.com/goodsdetail.php?i=6

Oh, and Boosted Board uses the 26650 cells.

Maybe these are actually 21700 Li-Ion cells ? I'm betting on Samsung INR21700-30T cells arranged in 13S2P ?
That would make up for a max discharge rate of 70A (max 35A per cell), just like with the 12S A123 Pack of M1a cells... But total capacity would be 6.0Ah... Or maybe 5.7Ah if you don't fully charge like boosted does (charging up to 54.4V instead of 54.6V)...

We won't be absolutely sure though until someone dares to open it.
