Hi guys. 
I want to put some info on my XL Decks in one place to make it better for everyone with questions about it to find answers. 

Let’s start 
The XL Deck 
![image|690x388](upload://51SkAu7jZoePluqKi1e90aokrKN.jpeg) 

![image|690x388](upload://cS4IWiOZw2s80DXFUJBS6Nnz4mV.jpeg)

This is an off road style deck with a big camber and angle tips specific to be use with Channel trucks, the riding style on this type of deck is similar to an snowboard. 

This is a full synthetic deck made out of Carbon Fiber, Basalt Fiber, Fiberglass and secret sauce epoxy to have the best strength to flexibility ratio while preserving structural integrity. 

This are the dimensions of the Deck. 
 ![image|690x387](upload://ahvjnB9gGBFVG53bMrmRrRez2wO.jpeg) 

It will be available in 3 different Flex varieties.

* SOFT
Super bouncy and fun, perfect for Riders up to 150 pounds. 

* MEDIUM
This version can be compare to a Vanguard Flex-1 deck but a bit more stiff, perfect for Riders up to 180 pounds. 

* HARD
This version is recommended for those speed demos :smiling_imp: (_yes! YOU_ )and is recommended for Riders 200 pounds and up. 

Beside the default versions , **later this year**, upon request will be available a XL-PLUS version that will depend on the Riders weight, foot stance and another changes that can be made specific for the customer. 

**The CONCAVE** 
I’ve chosen an Tub Concave for this deck, it is a FlatCave/Gaspedal combination it is similar to a Progressive board, but instead of a gentle curve, the rails extend at an angle from the deck. This Tub boards will keep your feet flatter, which makes for a mellower ride, but the sharp rails will  provide anchorage for sudden shifts in energy.

The combination of FlatCave, GasPedals and Angle tip provide instant feedback to the rider on where you are on the deck without the need of taking your eyes off the road, making it easier to change the position of your feet and stance without loosing concentration, after a while this feature become second nature. 

Besides the different Flex type also will have 2 choices of concave angles to accommodate most riding preferences and styles, let me elaborate on each one.

1. **Racing Concave** 
This is a steeper concave design to aggressively  lock your feet into position providing support for hard maneuvering, turning and off-road fun, is meant for more experienced riders with well develop lower leg muscles. 

A side by side picture, The top deck has the Racing Concave. 
![image|690x413](upload://buI0z7k5VqATonHiqZJVzMQC0qb.jpeg)

2. **Cruising Concave** 
From the picture above, it is the Concave on the bottom deck. Developed with less aggressive riders in mind, super fun for long rides and lost of smooth carving to just keep surfing that endless WAVE :ocean:.

Still both type of concaves will be pretty stable at high speed and super fun to ride also the deck visuals will be the same. 

Almost can’t tell which is which. 
![image|357x500](upload://4V0pS0Te4g9yqhcFp7Bu6mjxMRp.jpeg) 

![image|666x500](upload://qWN06THIIQB0071l2bUeXWKwh72.jpeg) 

The Left one is the Cruising concave. 
![image|690x492](upload://3bQxaNTtgLIcorpNcSEUY3qRMAs.jpeg) 

Cruising concave 
![image|357x500](upload://s1n4zrjJzToiuG95MTWAhWGkOSv.jpeg)

Racing concave   ![image|400x500](upload://nP5qrA9Rpv6fenFnzK27Wit61dH.jpeg) 

The Decks are design to be paired with our Channel trucks ( more info on this later). 

For the trucks we have pre-drill holes for **INNER & OUTER** spring position pairing this with our softer springs and hollow dampers ALL riders can customize the turning ability to your specific preference and riding style. 
No more stiff truck to go fast or soft trucks to go slow, just properly tune equipment and GO!

Can those sharp corners be rounded? For me it's both design thing ( in my opinion it would look better) and a bit safer maybe?
Anyway amazing work! :D

Great work, as always!

@mynamesmatt 
Will have matching enclousure for 12S-4P of 20700 or 21700 cells. 

also working on the XL50 battery pack that will fit this deck. It will be 3 or 4 separate 12S-3p @25amps packs working in parallel. Made out of Sanyo18650GA for 1350 to 1800 wh/hr.  

@Sender you need at least 2 holes on each side for guidance, it is extremely tricky to have properly aligned holes on this type of deck, just let me know what you have in mind and I can accommodate. 


@Grozniy
Don’t know how the RKP will work on the deck since the tip angle will make it hard to work but regarding urethane I’m already working on something inspired by this below but with street threads

These decks look great. I'm looking forward to riding mine. With those 8" wheels it actually will make for a great city commute which is my plan to replace my current boards here in San Francisco. With construction projects, busted up streets and cobblestones I do not understand how someone with street wheels moves around a city without constantly risking it all.

With the flex of the deck I also am expecting it to smooth out any of the terrain I cover. 

Do you think bindings will be necessary or will the grip be enough?

@Sender
I’ll send you a hole layout. 
I can drill the 2  bottom holes on each side this will allow you to properly anchor your base. 

@baxter
Here you go

@brenternet
I don’t recommend bindings unless you are going with a 100% off-road setup, Top mounted battery. 

@ARetardedPillow
+40 years sounds about right for a degree in America

The deck looks beautiful.
I have an observation though.
It seems the concave on the ends of the deck stiffens that area significantly thus preventing the deck from  flexing uniformly. 
A solution to that would be some sort of softer material that attaches to the deck similar to what some people have done or a reduction in thickness on the concave part.

Hey I’m looking to buy the kaly xl2.0. I’m currently riding the Halo Board 2 but the range sucks (maybe 4 miles its been a problem since I got it). I get beet up with all cracks and uneven side walks in Miami & Its time for an upgrade. First I’m wondering how much the Kaly Xl 2.0 weighs which I’ve scoured the internet for and can’t find a strait answer. Second I want to get the superfly wheels just in case I don’t like the pneumatic tires. Does anyone know if they are plug and play on this board and if so is there enough clearance with the battery pack below the board. Lastly I’m 150 lbs but am thinking I might want the Hard deck instead fo the medium. It sounds like since I’m used to a carbon fiber board which is stiff and like to ride fast this might be the way to go. Any input?@Kaly maybe you can answer this best. 
Ps. Regardless your boards are sick bro. Also do you know of anyone in MIA that has one I would love to check one out first hand.
