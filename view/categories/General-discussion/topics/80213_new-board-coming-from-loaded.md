I’m real excited. Ended up signing for their newsletter lol. My guess is a revamped dervish sama by the looks of it or a tan tien :thinking:

Whatever it will be it will be good.  I own the Icarus and the Truncated Tesseract and they are both fantastic

Admittedly, I’m a Loaded fanboy as well lol. Ive got the Tarab and my Kutthaka should be arriving in a day or two. Pricey but the material quality is without a doubt evident in the construction

Oh yeah expensive but they know how to make a deck.  Like you say the materials quality and construction is second to none.
