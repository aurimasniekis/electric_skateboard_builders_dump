Hi, I found that there isn't any Canadian Thread here so, I'm making one.
Feel free to share anything~

To introduce myself: I live in Toronto and this is my board. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcJcce2q4bo

Nice man!
I live in Ottawa and I'm starting to write down my project.
Where did you get the parts? Online?

Although it's more of a who's where thread. We definitely need more part resources in Canada.

I bought ceramic bearings in aliexpress for $15 for 8 and they works great. I haven put on my board but ... the tolerance isn't  so good tho some are louder, one is very tight sealing. <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/3/6/36338d94bb409cbba76d3cd77f0cb79a4d641cd0.jpg" width="690" height="388">
