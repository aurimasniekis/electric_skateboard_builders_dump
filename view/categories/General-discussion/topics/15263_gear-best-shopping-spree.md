I got 3 floureon batteries from there recently, would have saved me $100 bucks. But a lot of stuff on that site are clones. Haven't done much window shopping on that site anyways.

Either the 5065 Racerstar motors or an Anet A8 3d printer kit

Sorry to resurrect an old thread.... but I'm trying to get some information on the racerstar motors? 
I've got a couple (200kv) on a slow boat from china but Maytech need details of the motors to set up the dual esc they're sending me. Would anyone be able to help me?

What details do they need? Most of the details for the VESC will be to do with your battery, and you'll have to do a motor detection which figures most of it out for you.

Maytechs new dual esc isn't a vesc. 
It wasn't really clear when I put the money down on it but it seems that once set by the factory that is that..
They want to know the poles, the wire thickness and internal resistance?

Gearbest sucks hard, they are the worst and god their support is awfull
Shipping time this year takes a month from a usual week
Even if you pay the "fast delivery option" and they wont refund it if it took more than they said like 3weeks more
