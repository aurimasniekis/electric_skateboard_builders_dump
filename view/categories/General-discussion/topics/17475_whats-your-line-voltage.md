I get 121 volts at my house.
How many volts AC does your volt meter read?

119.8V reading off my Kill a Watt. The slight fluctuation does not really matter since most devices use a lower DC current.

Totally off Topic, In 7th Grade we had a whack teacher that cooked a sausage link using the 120v in the class, It was a fun day.

```
my gauge reads 118 to 119v 
how do you cook a sausage...just use it's electrical resistance and put a cut cord up to either end?  a prong terminal?  that sounds great.  with some really good rubber gloves why not.  and I guess glasses that would resist flying...what's melted metal called I cant remember
