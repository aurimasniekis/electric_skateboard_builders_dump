My biggest fear when going around on an eskate are a sudden electronic failure or something similarly, throwing me of the board out of the blue. That happen tp me today and I can‚Äôt figure out what the hell happened. 

I was doing my speed runs I just launched for the one where I really would give it all. Slightly downhill and the wind in my back. But I didn‚Äôt get very far before the board threw me off. It kinda felt like that the board just stopped / blocked or something. Luckily it was in the beginning of my acceleration so I was not going very fast (20 mph), but it was enough speed to launch me forward. Reflectively I took a long step and landed first on one foot and then down on my stomach and hands sliding. I sled long enough to think ‚Äúhey now I am sliding. Wonder how my shirt will hold up. Kinda nice feeling sliding when I think of it :) I was wearing knee pads, hillbilly crash pants, kvelar shirt, elbow pads, and slide gloves. So I am fine and nothing seriously happened.  

The thing is that after the board worked fine. No sign of things that were wrong. I only took the board to 17 mph on my way back. But no issues. 

I had the metr app running when I crashed and the only thing that stands out are the motor current that did go all the way to 118 two sec before the crash (I did start the acceleration from standing and slightly up hill). That might be the reason. But would that block the motors and then afterwards work fine again? When I look that other vesc data I have I see that the 118 motor amps are the highest I have seen yet. Normally its around 80a when It‚Äôs the most. I haven‚Äôt been close to 118 before. 

Anyone have any suggestions on what might have happened. I know you don‚Äôt have much info to guess from. But Anyway. 

This is the metr data: https://metr.at/r/LEFou

Motor amp spike caused your motor controller to shut down. The sudden loss in accelleration feels like the board is braking but it is not.  What is your motor max set at and gear ratio/top speed?  The taller the gear ratio the more susceptible the system becomes to current spikes when pushing the throttle.

If the Vesc short down wouldn't we see that the Voltage would drop very low in the metr data? It only drops to 35V. Or would the short down be so short that it wouldn't be caught in the data? 
I have tried to short the board down while giving full throttle and the V drops tp 9V And sometimes, but not every time, the metr app gives a warning saying "Under Voltage". That didn't happen with my crash. 

My motor max is set at 80a and my gear ratio are 16/40 and I hit 37 mph as max speed.

Crash data:

Under Voltage Warning when testing shirtinget of the board. But that warning only came once, and I turn off the board multible times:

I am really surprised about that spike in motor amps. I haven't seen that before. Normally I am around 80 when it is highest. And I didn't feel I was accelerating that hard. Strange.

Sounds like motor desync due to hard throttle input that can't be followed and then resulting in cogging at high speed felt like locked motor. 
Huge amp spikes also indicate that your esc had a super hard time driving the motor and/or the current ripple from the desync overflow the current management loop
Do a better detection and try again 
Also hardware side is extremely important, make crazy strong soldering job and ensure electricity can flow with no bottleneck. Use ton of tin, big cables, and be sure vibrations can't loosen connection

```
The vesc has a hard cutoff at 120 amps and in your app data you hit a peak of 120.7 amps. This only cuts throttle and does not shut the whole system down. It looks like your board is set up with a top speed just under 40 mph, this is high enough to start triggering these spikes when throttling hard at 50% duty cycle.

If you lower your max motor amps down to 50 or 60 amps it will give the soft cut off more time to engage and prevent the hard cutoff.

Motor detection should be with the motor free to spin, no belt or gears should be attached.

Ahh that makes sense... Thanks Chaka. 

Would lowering the motor amps make the the top speed less? 

It sunds like I need to upgrade my setup to handle more strain if I want keep doing these speed runs.  What would you suggest I look at?

It will not lower the top speed but it will lower the torque you feel during acceleration. Looking again at your app data and it looks like your motors are being driven very hard, you can see the temp rise when the board stopped moving. They could have picked up some resistance from heavy use so It might be worth while to recalibrate to help prevent another hard cut-off.

"recalibrate" now we are entering unknown territory for me. 

You are right. I properly drive my motors to hard. they are 6365 200kv. I run pneumatics 150mm.  

I did adjust the belts a little before this run. Made them a little tighter. And one motor are saying a noise. But thats not in the motor when there is belt on. I think its from a loose motor pulley, where the scrub screw is funck and cant be tighten anymore. So the bully sit loose and makes a noise. 

But I will check everything again. 

What would be a reasonable temp to have. When I see other data I have the temp hit 60 degrees C.

When a say recalibrate I mean run motor detection again. üòâ

I also recommend taking a mental note on how much torque you were feeling when the cutout happened. You most likely hit the maximum power you can pull out of a vesc based on v4.12

Could also be that the motor saturated and the observer lost track of it

You could a bit with saturation compensation, but only way to test would be induce the problem again, not sure if you are up to it

```
So I had the exact same fall and I figured out the reason eventually by doing a bench test. Accelerate the board by pulling the full throttle on a bench, does one of the motors stall? 
In my case the motor was stalling only when accelerating too quickly. The reason was bad motor detection. That fall fucked me up real good.
To avoid this do a bench test every time you do any changes to the drive train. If there is cogging, time to re do the motor detection.

Weirdly nothing happened to the shirt but at the end of the sleeve. Think I might have taken most on the pressure with my gloves. One hand did get caught between my chest and the road which ripped the side of the glove. And just now I see that the jaw part of my helmet took a hit as well. The only thing I feel now is the heel on the foot that took the first impact (can‚Äôt stand on it. Need to be on my toes). And on the dorsal side of the hand that got caught.

Nice and clean!

Do you lean forward when grabbing the throttle? I'm always afraid of this, so rather than lean forward, I bend my knees and sit down. Gives me a fighting chance at staying on if throttle cuts. Not sure if I can stay on if it cogs though.

Yeah.. I do lean forward. I lean forward all the time mostly when going fast. Practicing the tuck. But I have the feeling that when something happens as it did to day I have no chance saving the fall. 
I think this is the significant main different between going fast on a eboard and going fast down hill on a gravity driving board. We have have the possibility of a electronic failure coming out of the blue giving us no time to react and work with the crash. In DH they often can anticipate the crash, giving them options to control the crash better.

I‚Äôm having similar problems with my 4wd. I‚Äôm pretty sure all 4 motors go out together when I accelerate hard from still and it‚Äôs on a 4way split ppm with 4 separate foc boxes. It would be odd if all four motors had a bad detection. I was under the impression it had something to do with the enertion nano remote since all four died together. I‚Äôm not getting any errors in the app. I know it‚Äôs hard to give input without me showing any settings

Open up your Nano-x and have a look at the battery. I had two that I never fully got around to using, so they were brand new, although had been sitting in a box for a while. One would not hold a charge, and the other would, but seemed to need a charge everytime I picked it up. Opened them both up and found this. Those suckers were ready to pop, and didn't even have a ride on them. Interestingly, I got these during Enertions notorious 2017 Black Friday deal along with some "in stock" FOCBOX's that showed up around Feb, 2018. So, according to the date on the batteries, they were almost 1 year old before I got them brand new, and neither seemed to hold a charge very well even then.

Hope you find the root cause of your problems. I do think however that full throttling on the bench is hardly a comparable test to full throttling on the road. You won't be able to ramp up enough amps to trigger the supposed fault.

Glad to know you were well protected... out of curiosity, what Kevlar shirt (or is it a t-shirt) is that?

A bench top dyno is on the to do list. Nothing fancy just a couple of drums heavy enough to draw a lot of power while spooling them up. Testing a board that tops out at 40+mph on the road is not that big of a deal but my last build doesn't hit its power band till roughly 30 mph and has a therotical top speed of 66mph.

Think you are right. I need the protection. I am to afraid of crashes not to wear them. Seriously considering some leathers. I wore this kvelar sweat shirt: https://www.xlmoto.dk/troje-xlmoto-fuld-aramid-sortsolv#?p Just saw that they also have it without the reflex writing now.

I am back doing my speed runs. If I kick push to start and don‚Äôt hit the throttle to hard, I am not close to the 120 motor amps spikes. 

To be hornets... When I look at my VESC data I don‚Äôt really know if they are normal or at values where I should be concerned. Especially I am thinking of the motor amps and temp. Is it normal that they are this high? If someone with more knowledge about this than me have time to take a look I would appreciate it. I want to understand better. 

It seems that my setup max out at 37 mph. I can‚Äôt seem to get it going faster. 

I run 10s - 6365 200kv - 16/42 - 150mm pneumatics - focboxes

√å can fully agree on this. My first build with no experience brought me around town for 2 years/ 2000km without a single hickup or issue. Only wearing a helmet. 

6 month ago after building my 2nd board 2nd ride it tossed me off quite hard on the asphalt during acceleration wearing thin clothes, just came out of the gym. BMS cutoff on cell voltage because of unbalance almost full discharged pack.

1 week ago rebuilt my 2nd board, it tossed me off again. Wearing motor jeans en hoodie with kevlar lining? builtin protectors wirst guards. It protected me actually quite good besides the road rash on the hip above my pants. (MBS crashpants laying in the closet....). This time mosfet of the antispark burnt probably due to insufficient cooling/issue cooling block.

I'm now looking for even more and better protective gear inspired by @Deckoz. I really appreciate your effort trying to convince people to wear proper safety gear. Somehow it is still little bit ignored.
Wearing proper protective gear is essential part of our hobby.

I¬¥m totally with you in gearing up to the max. As I come from the MTB part of esk8, falling is just a part of it. To achieve falling as save as possible is never bad. Save you more time on the board in future.

But I also think that maintenance of our boards is pretty much underrated.

[/quote]
That¬¥s just one of the things that can happen. 
Lose motor mounts, idlers, scratched cables, water in the enclosure and what not ever. Once the enclosure is mounted it¬¥s good and closed for ever for some of us. I think as min a weekly inspection should be part of a save ride. Just open up the enclosure, check the voltage of your packs, check if all cables still in place and connected, check motor mounts and screws. That's a 15min job for the most people and can prevent a lot of troubles later.

Or maybe get a smart bms which give you to monitor the individual pack voltage. Stay up to date with things who went wrong at other peoples builds and think about it and if that could happen with your build as well. One of the reasons why I for example never used my push to start switches was that just too much of this anti spark switches burned up and that was not worth the risk for me.

I crashed again today this time my own misstake. Was practicing cornering at high speed. Felt good. Nice feeling did a lot of them progressively faster. Until it became to fast :) And then I stupidly tried to run it off. But I had no change and ended up on my chest / stomach. Ended up in the dirt / crass. I wore everything I had but no impact protection other than the kvelar shirt on the chest and I think some rock gave me the two scrapes through the kvelar. But it's not the scrapes that's the worst. It's the feeling after the impact. But hey I am ok nothing seriously and I will be out again when the board is charged back up. 

It become more and more clear to me that I want the impact protection from my safety gear. That will be bulky and limit mobility and freedom, but hopefully not too much. A couple of days ago I ordered this piece. Could have used that today :) 

I am still considering some leathers, but as that can not be returned I will test other stuff first. And BTR doesn't do impact protection on shoulders, and I want it everywhere :) 

@banjaxxed Those look nice. I have seen some good looking crash pants form the MC world with hard protection on the sides as the one you link to. I think that's the way to go. 

I have the hillbilly short. they are ok. I ware the outside my trousers. Not the most sexy looking. But inside the trousers the limit mobility way too much. On the outside I don't notice them. They have a lot of padding BUT the hip crest and the hip padding are located so my trochanter major (the most protruding bone in the hip and where you will hit the ground) are right between the padding. Should not be possible whit all that padding, but it is :) I think I will ad some g-form pants for everyday riding and then the hillbilly pants when I am pushing my limits.

The MX/MC world are very mature sports with products developed over decades, the same type of injuries occur, makes sense to piggyback their protection 

Asides from the insignificant looks, what appeals is the hip area above the short line, these have lips areas which protect that part which often gets rashed.

I‚Äôd you want real protection of that area you need zip together bottoms/jackets as a jacket will almost certainly ride up when you slide

Most motorcycle gear is designed for one time use, ridht? At least the road bike style stuff. With the thought that hopefully you never make use of it. Nylon that shreds and is not repairable.

Race stuff (leathers) is different, and I don't know anything about dirt stuff, but I imaging you expect to fall in those disciplines and the gear is made for more than one get-off?

@deucesdown It seems that the motor cross and mountain bike gear are the gear that come closest to what I want from safety gear when I push the limits. I little correction of the design and it will be perfect.

@taz Do you have a link to the jacket your are using?

It is a Dainese Air Flux D1 and I have added a back protector. It is a motorcycle summer jacket so I can also use it during the summer. As long as I keep moving it is ok. During the winter I have to wear a down jacket underneath it since it does not provide any warmth or wind protection.

I would love to also get a leather winter jacket but it is a lot of money and since I got this one to work, I don't really see a reason for it.
