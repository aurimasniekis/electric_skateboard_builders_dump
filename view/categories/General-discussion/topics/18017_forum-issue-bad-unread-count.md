Anyone ever seen the unread topic count be consistently incorrect? It's been showing me 1 more than I actually have. It goes back down once I click on "Unread" but comes back again once I go back to the main page and refresh it (the browser refresh button). Been happening 100% of the time for the past few days across multiple computers.

Before:

After Clicking:

Yeah also happens to me with the new also.
I think it's the new chat feature, because when someone sends a message it's both new and unread.

Same issue here. Mildly annoying.
