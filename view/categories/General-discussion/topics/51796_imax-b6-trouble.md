Hi guys.

Just got my imax b6 today and I'm having a bit of trouble with it

First of all it's the imax b6 (copy) from hobbyking and I have a 15v 5a AC charging brick.

When I charge my LiPos (6s 5200mah)  I set it to 5a but when it's charging it only charges at 2.1a is this normal? Can I charge it faster.

Second is a hardware issue and I'm wondering if anyone else has had this problem. The port where I plug In the charger does not work correctly I have to put it at a angle and a heavy object on top. I think there's a issue with the outside connection.![15233574826921869310806|666x500](upload://h4LUmyseG6vWl2vOpwvh8Ewnalu.jpg)

IMAX lowers charging curret when cell voltage approach 4.2 due to balancing.

Itâ€™s a 50 watt charger.  So, its normal it can only charge to about 2A on 6s.  You can calculate max charging amps using watts divided by voltage, so 50 watts divided by 25.2 volts(6s).  

Sounds like you might have a broken solder joint on the power port, used to happen on laptops in the past when the cable was snagged.  You need to return the charger, or fix it.

Your power cable could be broken just before the plug that goes into the balance charger. Try another one too see if the problem is the cable, or the b6.

This is probably a stupid question - I just woke up. 

How do you want to charge a 25.2V battery at 5A with a 15V and 5A brick?

To increase voltage, the boost converter has to decrease current to about 3A. No?
```

Well the Imax is a 50w charger so for it to get 50w it needs slightly more than 50w on the input. So at 15v you would need 3.3334 amps to get to that 50w input even though the charge will only output about 2 amps because of the higher voltage output.

Another example you feed 10v into a boost converter and you set it to out put 30v. Now you want your output to be 30v 2a so about 60W. 

Input Wattage = output wattage (not including losses)

60w / 10v = 60w / 30v

10v 6amps = 30v 2amps

I think that math is correct and remember to factor in that most boost converters are around 90-95% efficient, although that decreases as the voltage difference increases.

Someone correct me if Iâ€™m wrong plz

Was your battery pack out of balance like 3.65V 3.65V 3.63V

The thing about some Cheap balance chargers Is instead of charging the " 3.63V" They would just charge the whole pack through the mains And then discharge the over charged ones and then charge them all up again,
and It would repeat it until all cells are 4.2 which takes a very long time.

Now what if you had this, 4.2V 4.2V 4.0V You would want to charge the 4.0V separately right?
Not charge the 4.2V 4.2V up and down until the 4.0V catches up.

Notice how that Fork Is inside the balance port. It is charging cell 1 by itself.
(at a low amperage the wires cant handle a lot.)

Its safe because if you chose the wrong cell, the Imax b6 clone will read the voltage 4.2 wrong one switch 4.1 that's the one then Imax b6 charge that one alone.

Actually even the very best of chargers work that way also.
I have a 1344W Powerlab 8 and a 350W icharger 208b that work that way.
The pl8 can charge through the balance leads but only for small packs. 
One of the differences between cheap small chargers and the big boys is in how much current they can discharge through  the balance leads.

Will this method work if I have a 5s battery with 1 cell dead. Reason I know it's dead because my charger detects it as a 4s now and won't charge anymore. Trying to find a way to fix that one dead cell

## \#28 Posted by: taz Posted at: 2018-04-11T07:01:17.243Z Reads: 31

It might work. Set your charger to nimh or nicd and use a very low charging current until the dead cell goes over 3.3v. Then switch back to Lipo mode to continue charging. Do not exceed 1A charging through the balance wires otherwise you risk overheating and damaging them.

Generally with a decent quality pack in good condition once the cells are balanced they should stay that way when discharging thus requiring minimal balancing when charging. If you have a pack though that is not so good (e.g. big variances in IR between cells ) then you will find out that it takes a lot more time to balance charge it.

No not really as long as it stays that way. If you want to increase the life of you packs avoid charging them above 4.1V and discharging them below 30% .
However may I suggest the purchase of a good powerful charger in the future as it is an equipment that will make your life easier, charge faster and last you for decades.

1+ I've read studies that said going from 4.2 to 4.1 can almost double your Lithium cell life 
(It was probably done with Li-ons but It still should help Lipos. 
But be careful with the cutoff voltage because cells can drift off quickly near the end.

Or you have hills Hit the gas brake gas brake etc? 

drive easy and you can add like 20% range.

It depends on the battery. Personally I never go below 3.75V with my RC model batteries. Destroying 2 x 6S 5000mAh packs to fly my heli 30sec more is not worth it.

It sounds higher than it really is Lipos voltage Drips fast past like 3.7V. 
(I've been told)
 
Hills could make your range smaller Try driving up a hill with a bike and on flat.
you will know hills take more energy.

3.5V is definitely too low. Do a web search and you will find various tables with different correlation between %-V.
The only proper way to do it is to make these graphs for each pack you have individually. Some charges can do it for you (my Powerlab 8 has that function) but you can also do it yourself.
However this is too much work, just don't go below 3.75V if you want your packs to last.

Well If you treat them wrong you'll have them for less than half a years.
They puff easier than others.

some people say lipos last fro 100-200 cycles others say 150-250 others say it lasted them 400+
I'd say the guys who claim 400+ go a little under 4.2 and stop at 3.75

Don't charge a warm battery, never store a fully charged lipo for more than 2-3 days. storage Charge is 3.8v 
that's all I know to keep them safe.
