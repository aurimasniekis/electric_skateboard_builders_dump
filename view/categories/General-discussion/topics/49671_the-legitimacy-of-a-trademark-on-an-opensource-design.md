Yeah wtf, he just now mentioned that after you've finalized everything pretty much and already sent units out?  Gdmf...
Heaven forbid we find a way around having to pay like $300 for one single VESC 6, using open sourced information...

In the EU a design right is granted on products you publish or place on the market. Since a product with a certain design is associated by users with a certain brand or quality this makes sense. 
A copy tries to make use of a design and the associated reputation that has been build up by someone else. The customer gets the impression he could get the same product/quality from a different source, or he gets confused about the origin of the design. Reading through this thread you will quickly get the point. 

I did not threaten stiwii, I informed him about the fact, that we took care of the matter last year and that a straight copy clashes with our IP in the EU. 
I did that before he invests into stock that might breach our IP. I would say its better to be informed about facts, so that you can act accordingly and judge yourself if your design is far enough apart from the original to stay on the legal side. That is up to him to decide. 

There are many ways to design a HW 6 based ESC. Why copy an existing design that is associated with another brand? Everyone complains about Chinese copy cats, taking advantage of other persons designs and offering clone products soon after the original design is placed on the market. I can see the same thing happening here. 

The way we designed the Vesc Six is one of many many options. If you plan to make your own ESC, simply get inventive and choose a different design.
It should not be to much of a job. Focbox, esk8 1.1, vesc six and all the custom builds we see on this forum are prime examples of different designs, housing similar technology. Each design is associated with a different brand. This is how things should be! Legislation in the EU clearly states that designs should differ. And there are good reasons that your design/IP is granted protection. IP protects your invest into your developments and makes sure that customers aren't fooled around. 

Tesla open sourced their patents, but that doesn't mean you can build a car, looking the same. You can make use of the technology to build your very own car, featuring your own design. 
Open Source doesn't necessarily mean copy paste.
 
My advice is: Get inventive and design something that people can associate with your brand/identity. 
If you copy a product you are not seen as the originator and  that impression will stick to "your product" like chewing gum in hairs. It doesn't work in your favor to sell a straight copy of someone elses achievements.

stewii's hardware design is different
some features and components of the vesc 6.4 have been removed
some other components have been changed
the pcb is different dimensions cause it is not the same
the form factor is also different
different name...

no "straight copy"

As far as this concept of people thinking the products are similar they are both using the same opensource software, as long as stewii gives credit where and how it needs to be due...

Nothing "specific", to be specific there would need to be a patent.
No patent, only a trademark on a mark other vendors were already using in the marketplace.

His design is different. You do not get to threaten a member of the forum for owning a design pattent on "a box with wires and connectors". Good luck with selling the vesc six if you don't have the good will of the forum where the vesc gained it's popularity.

Lower the price of the vesc 6 and you will find alot of people buying your version. Don't go after members of the forum offering affordable alternatives, it's that simple.

From vedders own page: he states his vesc project is a opensource esc, software and hardware. How has that changed?
If that is the case just need to credit vedder and jump through the few OS hoops?

Here comes Trampa shitstorm again. There is a whole post about the VESC6 trademark and there was not a single mention of hardware design and etc. There are no patents based on the aluminum box with PCB cover so I don't see any problems at all. I can make one on one design without any VESC mention and use my own firmware with software and as there is no trademark/patent/license involved it shouldn't be a problem.

You are precisely right. 

[quote="trampa, post:603, topic:37579"]
In the EU a design right is granted on products you publish or place on the market.
[/quote]

This is not true. First, designs in the EU do not exist as of use (unlike a trademark, which does not require a registration). They need to be registered. In the UK and all over the EU. See here; https://www.gov.uk/design-right

Second, a registered design covers the _esthetic_ aspect of an object, not its functionality. PCBs have nothing esthetic. Even if you attempted, you'd be very hard pressed to register a design on a PCB. Unless the physical PCB had the shape of a skull or a skateboard, then you might. Here, it's a square. So none of that.

[quote="trampa, post:603, topic:37579"]
The customer gets the impression he could get the same product/quality from a different source, or he gets confused about the origin of the design.
[/quote]

This is not quite right either. What you're referring to here is passing off, which is a trademark concept. And the end goal of a passing off lawsuit is always to attempt to show that the infringer is attempting to pass off his products as being the same source as the rightful owner of the trademark. Here, @stewii is not attempting to pass of his VESC as Trampa's. Unless I am mistaken, everyone on this thread is very clear that Trampa is not associated with @stewii. The is no confusion as to the source of @stewii's VESCs.

The only IP I see is the copyright in the printed circuit board itself, which belongs to its original author. And if that author did not do it from scratch (and he used for examples some little bits and pieces from different PCBs all over the place), then there might be many authors to the copyright. And to infringe copyright, you need to show that a _substantial portion_ of _your_ copyright has been infringed. Very hard thing to do. Nobody has a monopoly on the Moby Dick story.

So, unless you have a registered right (which only protects you for the country in which the right is registered, there is no such thing as a worldwide patent for example. It's always per country) in a specific given country, you have no leg to stand on in terms of enforcing IP rights.

I've sided with you so many times, Frank, but this sounds to me like Apple patenting rounded edges. BV has specifically allowed others to produce and sell hardware based on his hardware design. So I don't think you can "inform" anyone that they can't do that. 
[quote]
Fair use of the trademark essentially is that you can base your design/product on all the open source software and hardware that I have published (following the license terms as usual), but you have to sell it under your own name and give attribution to the project.

Fair use of a trademark does not exist. Fair use is a concept associated with copyright (which allows you, for example, to make copies of pages of a book at a university library and not get sued by the author - that is fair use for academic purposes). Vedder is not well counselled and this is precisely why his trademark gets weaker everyday that passes. These concepts are all very specific and you need advice by professionals if you start venturing into IP enforcement and protection.

I would be very interested in seeing the letter that Trampa sent you if you wouldn't mind sending me a copy. 

I have an attorney that I havenoaid a significant sum to look at the so called trademark and fair use rights that Trampa/Frank claims.  It's all a bunch of smoke, no substance. I was waiting for the Trampa boot before I released the info, I may go ahead and do that. 

Anyways, I would very much like to show a copy of this letter to my attorney. Thanks

Going after someone for designing a metal box with wires sticking out of it and claiming he's infringing on your design patent is absolute BULLSHIT. It's as stupid as Apple and King with their bullying tactics.

Coming here onto these forums and deliberately trying to stymie any innovation and progress for your own benefit is absurd. Please go crawl back under whatever rock you came from. You'd be doing us all a favor.

What it says about Frank and the brand Trampa is that he is concerned about the possible loss of sales due to someone else coming up with a similar product and gaining a LOT of popularity. I can understand his position, however I do not agree with his reaction. Threatening people who may pose an issue to your business is not how you should run a business and you will lose customers. 
@stewii keep doing what you've been doing man, and that is providing an alternative to overpriced products from greedy vendors. Look at it this way, you're obviously doing something very well if you have the likes of other business worried enough to be contacting you.

I know a lot of companies owners are on this forum, now would I be wrong in thinking Trampa is the most successful, biggest one?  Probably followed by Enertion... well regardless, Trampa seems to me to be the most used boards and now they even have the license for the VESC 6, I imagine Frank threatening @stewii is just him being more and more greedy, coming up with frivolous lawsuits, very much like a patent troll...

I find it absolutely absurd that Frank is calling the VESC 6 his achievement.  I wonder just how much input, if any, he gave to BV while developing the VESC 6.  I imagine he felt like he won the lottery in getting BV to work with him and license this under Trampa's IP.  Unfortunately he got greedy and decided to charge an obscene amount for them, which is what caused these alternatives to come to market.   If Tampa had just charged a reasonable amount I think it's safe to say they'd have sold many more units and in the long run would have made a larger profit even.  Since the opposite was done, they are directly responsible for the competitive market that's been created for the 6th version of the VESC.  As was said earlier, people aren't confusing the ESCape for the VESC 6, but rather the other way around, and as a direct result of how Trampa is behaving.  Trampa is going about this trying to threaten/intimidate the little guy,  so to speak. Personally,  I will make it a point to never purchase anything from Trampa, and hell if @stewii has to end up charging the same, or more, I'd still buy from him, just out of principle. Additionally, I think it's pretty reckless to call the ESCape an  exact copy.  Anyone with eyes can tell that claim is BS!

http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/hw6-4-based-esc-escape/37579/8?u=uigiroux

In addition to the visual differences, it's clearly stated in the first post, and the one above, that this unit doesn't have the motion detection chip that VESC 6 does.  That seems a pretty large thing to overlook if your going to say someone made an exact copy of your design.

We all drive cars and they all have 4 wheels, headlights and a passenger cabin. No one has a design on the concept itself and everyone can make cars but they are all designed differently. That is what design is about.
Even pullovers look different, most of the featuring two sleeves and a body.

If you look at what @stiwii has done you will realise that "his" design is a straight 1:1 copy of ours. 
If you think that this is the only way to design a HW 6 based ESC, you are all on the wrong train.
This would be like saying that all e-boards would need to look exactly the same since they all have a deck, 4 wheels, two trucks a drivetrain, motors and a battery tray.
Funnily enough, a Raptor 2 looks different to a Boosted, a Trampa street carver or a Marble Board and Ollins Boards although they all share similar technology. If you would take of the logos it would be easy to identify the source.
They all look different and are designed differently, just like a Mercedes looks different than a Toyota or GM car. My Lenovo Laptop also doesn't look like a MacBook or an Acer although all 3 of them have a keyboard, a monitor and a hinge. They differ in all aspects beside the general concept of a laptop.

**You guy all confuse design and technology**. As I said before, a FOCBOX and a VESC SIX are prime examples of how a similar product can differ in design and are associated with different brands and levels of quality.  **A design covers the products appearance, not the technology involved.**

Even if a product is minimalistic in design, like a tablet or smartphone, there are still enough options on the table to design it differently. This is why we have a variety of models to choose from, going into a shop.
Again, if you think that all tablets need to look the same, you are limited in your imagination. There are substantial differences in between the different models.

Back in the 90ties everyone thought that a computer needs to be a square box from metal in alpha white, ideally with greenish logos applied. Then Apple made computers looking completely different. They were thinking outside the box. 

I find it astonishing that you all want the same cake all the time. Wouldn't it be better to have more choice in future? Even cakes look different although most are round and have a certain hight to diameter aspect ratio.

If you copy **a design** and then you figure out that your copy clashes with the original design, you should blame yourself, not the originator of the design.  

As I said, get creative. 

Frank

BTW: The concept of the housing and position of the connectors is my work, not Benjamin's. 
He designed the PCB, I designed the housing and then we optimized both to work hand in hand.
Even for the same PCB there are tons of options on the table to house it, differing from our design.

When I talk about **design**, I am talking about the finished product, **not the PCB**

I don't see any issue in others making HW 6. I just see an issue if those devices are a 1:1 copy of our design. I also don't get the point to make a fuss about a certain design that we use. Since it is quite simple to design your own device, being different enough to meet legal requirements, it is not hindering anyone to make HW 6 based ESCs.

@trampa  "Wouldn't it be better to have more choice in the future".  Interesting you saying that, when you're directly in opposition to us having more choice for a version 6 VESC...

Also acting like this is just a matter of the design of the ESCape, and not related to sales and profits is very clear to everyone.  I would venture to say even if the design was completely different, you would still try and find a way to put a stop to more competition any way you could.  Your motivations are not altruistic, or for the betterment of this hobby, it's all about the money.

Hey Frank,
you are just hurting yourself here. The design differences are obvious enough, not much to gain there. The Focbox is also a square, so is your design a copy of that, just with different HW?
If you are scared, just compete on the market!!
Thank you @stewii providing an alternative design and market segment for us!

Yeah, designing the enclosure, that's got absolutely nothing to do with what the VESC 6 does, it's a box to put the VESC in and works as a heat sink.  As stated above, that's really just too close to the FOCBOX... I think @onloop has a case against you for design infringement. Oh and deciding where the cables went.... Well, I imagine that would go where BV put the connection point on the circuit board.   That's like baking a cake with your mom when your young and she let you crack a few eggs to go into the mix and you taking credit for the whole cake.  Yeah, you helped.  Did it make any difference or change what would have been created regardless of if you helped or not.  NO!

Well Frank that is a hell of design that enclosure..... As you probably know I'm making those enclosures for @stewii and I received from him first model and than we went through some small changes and than because of some CAM issues I had to redraw everything and guess what it never cross my mind to look at Vesc6 to do that job. Yes they are similar in some way but it's a fucking box! If you made that you know damn well as I that this form factor is not because it's beautiful design but because manufacturing optimization. I have a feeling that you simply want to force him to choose more expensive design to produce. 

[quote="trampa, post:644, topic:37579"]
Funnily enough, a Raptor 2 looks different to a Boosted, a Trampa street carver or a Marble Board and Ollins Boards although they all share similar technology. If you would take of the logos it would be easy to identify the source.
[/quote]

Yeh but on the other hand you could choose brands that are more similar in look than Vesc6 and ESCape.
As you said it's all about those details. The color of pcb is different, the logo is different (nicer ;P guess who design that :P ) the box I believe is smaller in every measurement......

**So I'm serious asking you this right now. Please direct me to papers and rights that you have obtained regarding Vesc6 design that we could all know what to avoid in future!**

And what about this?

Implying that your customers would be confused and wouldn't know which is which really says a lot about how smart you must think your customers are...

See, I don't see an issue in others making HW 6. 

Copying a design 1:1 is not O.K. if you ask me. 
If you are talking about choice, that doesn't mean choice of the very same design.
Sounds to me like someone saying: I wan't the choice between the original and the 1:1 knockoff A,B,C,D.
You should rather demand the choice between Product A B C D, all having their own USPs. That is real choice and helps you to get what you want and helps that a variety of different products enter the market. This drives innovation and is good for the customer. Not only will you have choice between price tags, but also between different models. Most products I know of come in all sorts of shapes, colours, material  and dimensions. Seams like some guys here rather prefer a monotone product world. Quite Funny....

If you want to buy a cheaper product, fine!  It is up to you to judge the quality and product value.  And it is up to the vendor to prove his product to be competitive.
If you come up with a 1:1 copy it is not in your favour anyway. You would base your business on the basis of giving customers the impression that they can get the **very same** thing for a different (smaller) price tag. 
This means you try to take advantage of the efforts someone else put into creating and marketing a product.
This is the exact reason why the EU legislation puts designers in a better position to fight for their original designs. A design stands for a certain level of quality and trust into a brand.

It is up to the vendor to decide how close he dares to adopt an original design. 
I informed about facts, so he can make his decision in full knowledge and now he can get himself informed about the legal situation inside the EU before investing into a pile of stock that might be conflicting with our product design.

One thing I am finding unusual is that it seems @trampa is most concerned with how the enclosure and the PCB  look, but neither of these are the ESCape, that's the circuit board inside, which I haven't seen you write about at all, just the three items combined.  So what if @stewii just sold the ESCape, and then separately we bought the enclosure and PCB from two other sources?  Not one of those things on its own violates any patent.  Incidentally enough, @stewii offers to sell just the circuit board ESC, or you can buy it with an enclosure, which someone else makes, as well as the PCB.  Or you can have a DIY kit and build the entire thing yourself.  I think the fact that all these parts are not made just by @stewii, and individually each part violates nothing, so I think that further makes this product less like the VESC 6, since aside from the complete product, I have no idea what it looks like inside, and the insides are the ESC, not the case and cover.

No Frank the Vesc is not known and popular thanks to you or thanks to your case design and how it looks but because what is inside and how it works.

1. the esc is mostly hidden... you will not see it anyways....
2. if you really care about the colour just paint it pink.....

It is not like a car which everyonce can see daily and you have to identify yourself with it....
The ESC should just do its Thing and not look pretty...

You keep saying it's a 1:1 copy, but that is not true.  Some designs are a certain way because they have to be and others anther way because it looks more pleasing.  Form over function.  Would you say that two different paintings are a 1:1 copy just because they are on the same sized frame with the same sized canvas, same paint, hell, let's say there even a painting of the same thing, but painted by two different artists, one is a toddler painting a sunset, and the other is Michaelangelo painting a sunset...  So that is a 1:1 copy by the rationale your using, it's simply absurd.

Also your argument about getting the same thing if one is a copy of the other and how that isn't right blah blah blah.... BV specifically made this open sourced so I think it should be everyone's expectations that if your claiming to be selling a product that is based off of the open sourced information made available, then yes they of course should operate and do everything exactly the same, so long as each party followed the information that was made available.

Some things look a certain way because to function properly, the physics of the object are bound to certain universal rules.  For instance, a wheel can only be a circle if its too function the way its intended.  Other things can be left to one's imagination because it's not bound to the same universal laws.  Now clearly the shape of the enclosure could be different and the internal ESC would still work the same, but as space is a precious commodity in Esk8, then clearly the smaller the size of the ESC the better.  These enclosures aren't unique, original designs.  They are simple made to cover the ESC and take up as little space as possible, so if the HW 6 is a square or very close but technically a rectangle, it is hardly a copy of IP to design a form over function design that is as small as possible to take up as little space as possible to allow the overall functioning of the Esk8.

Maybe, but there would have to be a best design, most efficient, best use of space ask taken into account.  The people who make these circuit boards take all that into account when you are building something and I hardly think it's a stretch to say that the design of HW 6 was very carefully thought out by people who do this for a living and decided that shape was the best in terms of all criteria.

Ok, regardless of the design issue or whatever else you may have a problem with, here is the bottom line... As I see it, and I think I probably have a similar opinion as many others.

In terms of what is offered for ESC's I think it's generally thought that the HW 6 ESC is the best and most reliable thing available.  For a long time, people couldn't get one because you are charging a massively larger amount, even compared to things that are considered the next best like FOCBOX or whatever.  Then a guy working in his garage comes here and says he can and is making the same HW 6, and would you believe it, for less then even half of what you charge.  So now people who are in a tight budget can finally get top of the line equipment without having to empty their bank account or save up for many months, and right as things are being finalized, and even prior, you come on the forums and try and pull these scare tactic and legal bs, and you justify it by saying it is about the design of a BOX!!??  Really!  I mean you can come and argue with us here and condescendingly tell me this is a silly argument, but the fact of the matter is you're making a lot of money off of us simpleton customers as I'm sure you view us that way, and talk about how we need innovating and all this BS, but that's just a smoke screen to your actual motivations, and regardless of what you say the reason is for your opposition too the development of these alternatives, it's very clear to us the real reason.  It's the elephant in the room that you can't address.  You are drastically over charging for your product, and now that we know and see that the same product can be made, even with a profit for less than half of your cost... Well, sorry the cats out of the bag....

Well this is a lovely little sh*t storm to walk in on!

I've been researching and planning an eMTB build for half a year now, with only recently starting to buy parts as someone finally starting making a decently priced ESC based on vedders 6.4 opensource design.
I do love trampa parts as I've been riding one of there mountainboards for over 5 years now, but they have progressively been getting more and more expensive. A £300 VESC was the only thing holding me back from going electric. Easy to find cheaper but better motors (APS 6384s) but not so on the ESCs I wanted.

But as others have just started to notice, with this argument about design innovation and 1:1 copies, I find it incredibly ironic seeing as trampa's trucks and bindings are literally exact 1:1 copies of MBS!

A truck is a piece of technology and it can be made in various design styles. 
The Spring Truck concept is probably 100 years old. You will be amazed what people have patented back in the 1920ths for roller skates. 

Still a Trampa Trucks looks different to a MBS and a Scrub. The technology was used by various brands, but everyone used a different design. We introduced the all metal baseplate with cutouts and spring adjusters cut straight into the baseplate, proper spring retainers and Trampa Dampas, + new kingpin/bushing concept.
while the scrub trucks didn't have adjusters at all and used a catastrophic bushing design failing soon after first usage + you couldn't adjust he steering at all. The truck was pretty much useless. Then MBS copied our baseplate on the Matrix II before they moved back to plastic injected baseplates, which are cheaper to make.

A Ronin Truck looks different to a Caliber and a Paris etc. That is a matter of design. They all look different featuring a similar functionality. 
All of the trucks share the same technology but feature a different design.
Ronins additionally make use of a second pivot point support, which is an innovative feature. 

Technology is technology and design is design. This is why you can't patent a design in Europe and many other countries on the planet. You can file a design for a design and patent for technology.
Sometimes design and technology go hand in hand sometimes they have nothing to do with another.
When there are many options on the table how a product could look like, then the physical appearance is a matter of design. In most cases there are plenty of options on the table to shape things.
Bicycle frames differ in design, despite most using the same basic structural principle.

This is why you can’t patent a design in Europe and many other countries on the planet.
[/quote]

So stop threatening people with your bullshit legalese over how your design (a box FFS) is protected.  You cannot enforce this mythical protection you keep talking about, if you can't enforce it then it in fact does not exist.

The fact is you are on the wrong side of this.  You are only hurting Ben and yourself.  If you keep using these fortune 500 tactics when in fact you are barely a small business then what little revenue you still have is going to dry up...and you will be the only one to blame.

How do you know?


Maybe the Problem is that the box Looks identical...at first glance... 
on the bottom you have two cable for the battery and on the top three for the Motor. on top you have the connectors for misc. so a noob could easily mistaken this esc with the trampa vesc6 what violates the Trademark?
So the solution would be to rearrange the the cables and it doesnt violate anything anymore?

That's were your argument falls apart.  You keep calling a 1 to 1 copy aas if you say it enough times that will make it true.  But its absurd.  The dimensions are different, the port placement is dissimilar, the colors are different.

Again, technology and design are two pairs of shoes. 

The technology and software is OS and you can design your own ESCs and market them. 
There is simply no reason to copy an existing design. If you design an ESC, you could easily make things different. When I go into a shoe shop, I can see hundreds of different shoes. All of them are shoes, but al of them differ. As a consumer this gives me the advantage that I have a variety to choose from, and the companies offering their shoes can sell their products based on differences in design and quality.

All I am saying is that you should make your product differ from the products of your competition.
Why the hell on earth do people think the only way a HW 6 can look like is the exact way our product looks like. This is BS. There are 1000 ways to design it differently.

I'm starting to think your pushing this to make people re-design for reasons that have nothing to do with function just to cost them money and close the price gap with the Trampa VESC6.  It's a decent attempt, blatantly dishonest and amoral, but it doesn't hold water and everyone sees that.

@mmaner wow I honestly would never have thought that! In the thread for just pics no words I swear I see more Trampa then anything...  I guess Trampa owners just take and post more pics then the average Esk8 person, lol. 

I just tried to get some sleep and checked my phone and BAM there is like 50 more comments on this, and I am just dumbfounded at how someone can be so dillusional about something.  About 100 differences between the two products have been brought up, all of which have nothing to do with the actual hardware though, just the case, which as stated earlier is absolutely insane as Frank keeps talking about the entirety of the ESCape which to us, the consumer,  is the main concern, and every time he responds it's with some assanine metaphor about shoes or cars which he makes a case that has no possible comparison to the matter at hand and............................................................. and on and on it goes!

I feel I addressed this earlier and he just ignored it but allow me to be blunt, and reiterate myself.

I think it's especially telling of Frank's true motives here when he says how easy it is to come up with your own original design rather than copy. So it's asked what specifically do you have a patent on so we don't accidently have this same issue again, and he just completely ignores the question.  Basically he is not going to reveal that and really hopes that if a redesign does take place and it's somewhat similar to one of his claimed patents, then he can go through this whole fit over again, and essentially his end game is to try and make @stewii have to raise the price to recover any losses he might take, thus decreasing the substantial difference in prices and in doing so, Frank will only look like he's half screwing everyone over as opposed to now where everyone is getting....  Well, I'll end that scenario there, lol!

i have seen many open source projects where people involved dont seem seem to understand what open source this actually means. in some communities such as the multi-rotor community the same arguments about open source seem to happen again and again.

The point of open source is that you work as a community towards the best hardware for any application. anyone can copy/fork the software or hardware, make any improvements or changes (major or minor) and do whatever they like without the authors consent, as long as they give credit.

im not saying that that its moral, but there is nothing stoping someone releasing a 100% copy of an open source design as long as they give credit. and the project author (BV) knows this whenthey make a project open source. they accept that this can happen, but do it anyway in the interest of doing whats best for the community. To be honest im surprised that someone like maytech or turnigy has not started churning out rock bottom priced v6.4 hardware already.

also The Open Source Hardware (OSHW) Definition 1.0 defines hardware as _**"tangible artifacts — machines, devices, or other physical things"**_ it may be electronic hardware, mechanical hardware, textile or even construction hardware.
One could argue if the vesc6 heatsync was designed as part of the open source hardware, that it to should be open source hardware and available to anyone to clone and modify.

The Open-source hardware article on wikipedia states _**"information about the hardware is easily discerned so that others can make it"**_ and that "_**The original sharer gains feedback and potentially improvements on the design from the FOSH community. There is now significant evidence that such sharing can drive a high return on investment for investors.**_"

The smart thing for you to do here would be to look at the hardware changes that are being made and see how these are affecting usage and, if they are positive changes, port these changes back into your own designs. maybe we could see an official trampa dual heat-sync in the future?

@stewii Maybe the answer here is to try and create an enclosure for your pcb that is officially open hardware? Then anyone can mod and improve upon the design and there would be multiple different enclosure options to go with your ESCape's.

You cannot patent hardware designs of open source projects.

The schematic is open source. Meaning likely designs won't be so different. 

The L shaped pcb has been known for a  few things on more then just the vesc6, such as esk8.de and focbox

- smaller form factor
- isolates the high current traces to one half, and the EMF sensitive traces to another half, making clean power across the board.


Aguing that the Gerber's should be released... If you want your own pcbs use the schematic that is all that is required to make a pcb, as the schematic is the design. The pcb is the application of the design.

Just want to be clear, I'm not forcing anyone to do anything. I was just suggesting that if he wanted to sell ESCape's without worrying about getting hassle from trampa about case design then an option could be to let the community sort out case designs.

**A factual summary thus far**

Vedder's ESC project has always been opensource hardware, opensource software.
Anyone is free to duplicate it exactly as long as they credit Vedder in line with the GPL.

Vedder has a trademark on "VESC" so no new users (after his filling date) in the marketplace can use "VESC" to describe their electronic speed controller.

frank claims to have a world wide registered design on a box with 5 cables.

**Where to now?**

1. frank needs to provide us all with his registered design number so we can all do a search in our country/region of origin to see what the design is.
In Australia I would search here: http://pericles.ipaustralia.gov.au/adds2/adds.adds_simple_search.paint_simple_search

2. Not only does there need to be a lodged design in your country/region the design needs to have been examined in your country/region to be enforceable otherwise it is meaningless, anyone can claim anything.

So I have one question: 
@trampa
You are saying you have a "patent" or some kind of a legal protection on your design. If so, why isn't there any proof. If you would have/own said protection on your "design" why are you typing all the nonsense where you could have shut all our mouth with only one post by proving that you own the design patent or legal protection or whatever you call it. 

So for me any discussion or rant about it is obsolete.

In my opinion Benjamin Vedder ist the one almost no one talks about. Please consider to support him by sending him support in form of a donation (Hope this is still his PayPal Address:https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_donations&business=7ZMDJJFHUSCV4&lc=US&item_name=vedder%2Ese&currency_code=EUR&bn=PP-DonationsBF%3Abtn_donateCC_LG%2Egif%3ANonHosted ) . He is the one behind all this who deserves that, offering the community  the plans for a piece of high tech for free. I think he deserves that. 

And please, I know people are upset about trampa trying to get the best in his interest but please get you things together, get over it and please don't be so destructive. This community is about helping each other not ranting and hating.. This will not get us far. 

Just my two cents.

Well, I'll take your cake analogy and raise you another cake analogy. Once, there was a man who wanted a cake. He went to his local supermarket, and saw a round chocolate cake with brown icing, and a round chocolate cake with white icing. The brown iced cake cost $350 USD, while the white iced cake cost $180ish USD. They're both chocolate cake, one is just half the price of the other. It just makes sense. Sorry your prices are too steep. If I can get the cake I want for half the price, I don't care if it looks similar. A VESC in a box will most always look like a VESC in a box. UPS, USPS, FedEx, and everyone else in the world use the same cardboard boxes to ship things. It's the way the world works. :no_mouth:

This is because frank is claiming a new/unique/novel industrial design.

Some info from IP Australia on registering and certifying a design:

>Registration and certification are often confused. 
They are both stages in the design application process.

>**Registration**
Registration protects your design for five years from the date the application was filed and can be renewed for a further five years.

>If you do not renew your design it will cease. Once the design has ceased it passes into the public domain and is free for anyone to use.

>A registered right gives you, the owner:
protection for the visual appearance of your product
exclusive rights to commercially use, license or sell the design.

>**Certification**
**Once a design has been registered it can be examined. If the examination results in certification your design right is then legally enforceable.**

>**The benefits of certifying your design right are that if another person uses your design without your permission you can take action to stop them. You can only do this if your design is certified.**

>**To be certified, a design must be new and distinctive.**

>The main purpose of examination is to find earlier, similar designs to the one you wish to protect. If the examiner finds an earlier design which looks too similar to yours, your design may not pass examination. It does not matter who owns the earlier design. Even your own earlier design can prevent you from protecting a later design.

>**The difference between registration and certification**
There are six stages in the design process. Registration and certification occur at different stages:

>1. you file a design
>2. you can request your design be registered
>3. we will do a formalities check
>4. once the formalities check is successful and/or any issues are resolved your design is registered
>5. once your design is registered we can examine the design if you have asked us to do this
>6. if we find your design to be new and distinctive we advise you that your design is certified - meaning you now have legal exclusive rights over your design.


& lastly some information on international designs lodged according to the Paris convention:

https://www.ipaustralia.gov.au/designs/understanding-designs/international-designs

**While frank has claimed a "registered design" he has never claimed it has been examined or certified.

well you are in luck @mmaner

& it won't even cost that much (in Au, I doubt it will cost you sig. more in USA)

**Examination can be requested from a third party**
Someone else (such as a competitor) can also ask for a registered design to be examined. You might do this if you wanted to test the validity of frank's design. If this happens, frank would pay half the examination fee ($210 Aud), and you would need to pay the balance ($210 Aud). This is because if frank's design is certified he will stand to benefit from the action. If frank does not pay the balance, the design registration will cease.

In this process you are also able to provide evidence to be considered in the examination of frank's design.

To get the ball rolling you just need the design number.

**If frank's design doesn't get certified it will be de-registered.

I will be starting this process tomorrow, thank you for the info. Thank you very much. 

FYI, I did (or rather had done) a trademark and title search in the US.  There is no spproved trademark for any device with the title of VESC6 in the US. It's not possible to get an accurate view of what might be in process, but it is possible to see if there is a trademark in process that come before the TM.proxessing board within 90 days...no VESC6. 

Im guessing, but I would think the US would be the first place to get a trademark for the number of consumers if nothing else.

@mmaner Once you find the design number, look for the registration date. Then:

[quote="Cobber, post:168, topic:49671"]
The main purpose of examination is to find earlier, similar designs to the one you wish to protect. If the examiner finds an earlier design which looks too similar to yours, your design may not pass examination. It does not matter who owns the earlier design. **Even your own earlier design can prevent you from protecting a later design**.
[/quote]

So you just need to find one design of something that is similar enough to dissolve the design registration, it can even be a pic, drawing, render... on a forum somewhere of frank's case before the design was registered.

Guys, just as an aside, don't spend too much time on this. The certification process is pretty Australia specific, it doesn't exist in the US, nor in Canada and not in the UK as well. Plus, I'm fairly certain if anything had been registered, we'd have the registration numbers by now. It's still *crickets* on that front. 

If he can't show a simple registration number (this is the bare minimum for any IP enforcement attempt) for the UK, if be very surprised if you found one in Australia or anywhere else for that matter...

Anyways, just wanted to give you a head's up before you go too deep in a rabbit hole. 

Either way, don't hesitate to ping me if you have any questions.

Yes and he's also quick to throw out bogus allegations in an attempt to discourage smaller, newly started business's from going to market for fear of being sued.  Issuing allegations that are so absurd that it's clear to everyone he's in the wrong, yet if he says it over and over again somehow it'll magically come true. Over charges dramatically on certain products, and if you try and make a similar product from open sourced material, prepare for the Frank song and dance distraction, intimidation shit show...

All I am saying is that you should make your product differ from the products of your competition.
Why the hell on earth do people think the only way a HW 6 can look like is the exact way our product looks like. This is BS. There are 1000 ways to design it differently.

Frank
[/quote]

I can see from numerous postings that frank is making a fuss about the HW 6 looking exact way their products look like.
![differences|510x320](upload://84NX7Y84YmANT7jfb1DDMplPX5H.jpg)
3 spots on both the VESC6 and ESCape already show that it is an "exact" look.

Red rings - Connectors are positioned differently
Yellow rings - Different logo
Blue rings - ESCape have larger rounded corners as opposed to VESC6. 

Heck, the positions of the screws are all different too. 

As much as I like Trampa's product, this issue about the VESC6 and other HW6 ESC based on BV's hardware design that he made a fuss about is pretty darn stupid.

As a form of mobility tool that an E-skate is, what most people are trying to reduce are redundancy in materials which also means shaving off unnecessary weight. So if BV designed the hardware looking like this ![V6 ESC|475x500](upload://3DkcfPV6AFl7V4XKY2TbshcqzKK.jpg)

Which stupid fool will build or design something that not as form fitting and waste additional materials while also affecting the overall weight of the E-Skate?

I am not bashing on trampa in its whole entirety, but just pretty much how they are making a rant about the HW6 of a OS design. Trampa do have some awesome looking products, but the way how this current issue is handled sure leave a sour taste in some consumer's mouths.

I think they are more MBS clone. I like Trampa products as well and if they were not around it would be a huge lost for all of us. I just can't agree to nonsense in any form.

I will give you guys some stuff to think about:

Open Source technology and software have nothing to do with the design of a product or the design of a user interface. It is about the technology.

Example: If you work with OS Stuff, you can simply copy the existing technology, or you can try to play around with the technology and try to innovate and change things. The last will benefit a project, since new ideas are developed. The first doesn't bring innovation on the table.

From: www.vesc-project.com

_Another reason for not publishing the official hardware layouts as-is, is that it leads to many companies and individuals who have no background in electronics just giving a github reference to a manufacturer to make hardware and start selling it. Currently there are more than 25 places where V4.x hardware can be bought, with **quality varying from excellent to not working** at all. **If the same thing would happen with the VESC6 it would be confusing for the customers**. If you are serious about electronics, the VESC project provides everything you need to make **your own custom hardware** ****to fill a missing spot** in the market**, and then sell it. If electronics is not your area, but you want to sell your own hardware independently anyway, you can refer to the HW4.12 layout or wait for the three shunt reference PCB. We do however recommend and encourage that you get into electronics **and design your own hardware** if you are serious about what you are doing_.

I can't understand why everyone is so keen to see replications of the same thing, rather than seeing a variety of choice. HW 4 was a pure copy paste game, not really contributing to product variety. This was not in favour of innovation and moving things forward faster. 

You don't always need to reinvent the wheel, this is not what I am talking about. Changes can be smaller or bigger. 

So before jumping on the train, saying that we are over protective and blocking technological developments, you should shine light on aspects of the matter. The tech is free to use, it is not blocked at all.

A clone product doesn't move things forward, or in other directions. Many users here demand different hardware and there is probably a market for that. And even if you decide to make the exact same thing technology wise, you can still decide to create your own design for the device, so that users can easily identify the different models and vendors from another. This is not a big task and it should be more than just placing your graphics on the same design. 

If you start from scratch, designing your hardware, and you end with the very same design your competition came up with earlier, you probably didn't innovate, but rather copied. In addition to that, you placed your product inside the danger zone of being found infringing inside the EU where published designs are protected, whether you register them or not. I will post a link below.... 

Some examples what you can do with ease:
- The connectors can be in different places.
- the housing can be designed differently  (there are probably 100000 ways to do that)
- form factor can be different
- you could ad features, or you can drop features you find not very useful.
- you could make twin layouts (which is debatable)
- you could use other components
- you could create lower power HW and higher power HW.
- you ccould....

All that would help the community get access to different HW and it would help to generate choice over 
clones. I think we all enjoy choice, when going shopping and building things. Most builders here don't clone, they have their own ideas, which is great. Imagine we would see one clone build after another.

Another thing that is problematic about clones is the difference in quality, which is not always obvious, especially for inexperienced users. I think @Anorak hit the Nail on the head yesterday when saying " I rather buy this than that when can get "**the same thing**" cheaper, reffering to our and @stiwiis hardware.
Is it really the same thing thing? Only because it looks identical, it doesn't mean it is the same thing. 
HW 4 has proven that big time. Only time will tell.... 

From: www.vesc-project.com
_Currently there are more than 25 places where V4.x hardware can be bought, with quality varying from excellent to not working at all._

Going down the clone way means the same thing will happen again and especially inexperienced users may will waste money again.

My positions the following: if you design something from scratch, you can make the product differ from other products, even using the same technology. This is no magic. You can then build up your own reputation and your design stands for your product reputation. The community will benefit from that, by getting access to different hardware and availability of choice and improvements are made available faster. Even if the technology is the same, you can still dress things up differently.

If your position is fixed to the mindset that OS is predominately about CTRL C CTRL V, than you overlook some of the points above. The idea of OS is to move things forward, not to get stuck on one design.

I think it is always worth to shine light on all aspects of the matter and I can also understand the opposing position, wanting the same thing at different levels of quality and price tags and being furious when a certain design is blocked in a certain market. On the other hand this fact doesn't block anyone from choosing one of the other 100000 design options that free to choose from. It is a baby step that doesn't hinder anyone from placing HW on the market. 

One problem about copy paste is also that you don't really understand all aspects of the design. You copy without thinking about the detail that lead to the decision to go for a specific solution. In consequence copy products very often lack a certain standard when it comes down to the detail. The more complex a design is, the more likely it is that important detail get lost during the copy paste process. This is one reason why HW 4 exists in a terrible variety of quality. 

I would like to see a fair discussion around the matter, rather than seeing all that ranting.

And now to the Truck: I designed the baseplate that you can find on our Trucks.All existing designs had major weaknesses, so we decided to strip out these weaknesses and get the weight down as much as possible. MBS copied our design and then China copied it from MBS I guess. I think the copy truck is horrible, but you can judge that yourself. 

For everyone interested, this is some literature about design rights in the EU:

And yet @trampa ***still*** doesn't mention any patents or copyrights or trademarks after typing for 90 minutes.  Still.  *At this point, I'm going to call it.*  **They don't have any.**  Because obviously if it's important enough to not "copy" as he says, we should at least know what not to copy.  At this point, it seems a wood-framed house is an infringing copy because it's a rectangular solid with wires coming out.

Are you saying that no sock manufacturers are innovating?  Because they all look rather similar.  Have you considered the possibility that they are similar shapes because they are designed to solve similar problems?  Namely, protection of a human foot using cotton thread?  Maybe they are innovating on the production process and not the end product.  Now, what if it was driving of a 3-phase motor from a battery using the same open-source schematic?

If you're implying ESCape looks like VESC6, well, **it doesn't** --  not any more than a Chevrolet sedan looks like a Ford sedan.  That's just simply untrue at a minimum, and a greedy disingenuous money-grab at a maximum.  In fact, they are more different than that even.  Anyone who thinks different must have trouble buying milk at the store and frequently find out they bought orange juice or apple juice by mistake, thinking it was milk.

The Tesla and shoe metaphors especially fall apart if you consider the stemma of those relationships. Tesla, a proprietary company, released their IP they created for research and learning purposes and they control the licensing of that content. They are the parents of any subsequent children in that senario. Any subsequent descendants are subject to the parents licensing. However in this ESC senario the parent is an open source project. Bbox, escape, and trampas vesc6, are siblings all descendant from an open specification. Their variation is of the open documents not the trampa ESC. The common ancestor explains the similarities. @trampa's problem is that he has assumed his product as the root ancestor because it was first to market which doesn't seem to be a valid case. There is no link to variations shared between  these sibling escs. The likeness in asthetic is due to the asthetic being derived from engineering requirements of the common parent and not due to being derived from tramp's parts.

There are numerous HW 6 designs out there and most of them look completely different, according to the requirements the developers had.
@Kug3lis made an enclosure from two parts, which is completely different to ours. 

Our design is only one of many many ways how to style a product around a HW6 PCB, and the PCB is also not locked down to the exact layout we use.

@Cobber @Arch @JohnnyMeduse Thank you for bringing clarity to the legal matter.  

@Namasaki thanks for tracking this for us too, it allowed me to read through it all no sweat. Where do you find the time to manage that? 

@stewii as a beta tester from your awesome ESCape I can only say : cheer up and keep the damn good work on track! Heck I'd never even have bothered with HW 6.4 if this was not for your action.  

@trampa Don't you remember few months ago when I was angry at @Ackmaniac cause I wanted to work on porting the  OS software over and files were not yet available. I believe we got to talk about it. Then Nico finally rounded what he was meant to and required files were hosted publicly. 

Open source, *open mind*, open share. Give credits where it is due, but openly do what you want. Just contribute. That's what the core of OS community should be period. 

Anything going against that principle should be met by **Lucille** and **Negan**. 

What exactly are you trying to achieve by patronizing people on their creativity, and how dare you? On which basis? 

There is no reference HW available till today on Benjamin's VESC. He released schematics, BOM, software for the community to grow and expand. 

Well that's what is happening *right now*. People get their hands in the mud and get the work done! 

Why don't you take part in it instead of trying in vain to *control* it? 

Don't hinder progress made on Ben's work. Don't call Lucille over to your brand. You went OS the moment you decided to take Ben in, now you should act accordingly. 

I'll rely this thread to the French community by the way. People should be aware of what is going on.

Edit : BTW here that's Lucille.

The EU, nor the UK require your designs to be registered.
You can publish your designs and that gives you protection for the published designs (URD). You can publish them in BW, with colour or as line drawings. 
In he US or other countries this legislation doesn't exist, so you have more freedoms to copy products in those countries. I the EU URD (Unregistered Design) and RD exists in parallel.

The purpose behind this EU/UK legislation is to assure enough difference between products placed on the market. The further you place your product apart from  the competition, the less you are in the danger zone of being found fraudulent. 
In consequence it is wise to chose a substantial different design if this is an option. It usually doesn't hurt and puts you and your product in a much more comfortable position, creates uniqueness that is identified with your brand, which works in your very own favour anyway. Two good reasons....

Well, maybe don't do that, it might make you look even worse then your arrogance has done to you here.  I gotta say I really feel sorry for the other two who are in business with you.  Maybe they can deduct the amount of sales that drops as a result of this from your end.  Regardless, I have never in my life met someone in a position of authority who should know how to behave act so blatantly irresponsible and destructive.  You are acting in a way that is corrosive to your brand, and your customers and I don't think anything can be said to get you to stop and cut all the bull shit and just either release the patent number, or admit your don't have one and this is all as we suspected, just an intimidation move gone horribly wrong.  Either way, as I said before, everyone now knows that HW 6 can be purchased for less than half of what your greedy ass is charging, so expect sales to fall dramatically.

We went for a URD in different BW shades and line drawings for the VESC 6. 
It should not be a huge task to create products that differ from those designs to meet legal requirements. 
It is not our intention to block anyone from making **similar** products. Why would we want that?
As long as a competing device is different enough to meet legal requirements, it is fine to place it on the market.  We had some issues in the past with 1:1 copies of some of our products....

However, my position is explained above. Apart from the legal side of the mater, I would rather see people inventing and coming up with new ideas than purely imitating existing designs. All those builds up here are unique and that is a great thing. Personally I prefer variety of monotony. Why clone when you could also create something more unique that is just as easy to design as the clone?

Right, once again a total dodge, and you claiming this is all about the principle, and the integrity of design.  As if the enclosure was shaped like a triangle, you would declare the ESCape a truly inspired design and you wouldn't try and find something else wrong with it that you would then try and intimidate @stewii over just as you have now, and yet again, not show one shred of documentation to support your claim.

So once again, why not show us these documents in whatever shades you want I hardly think that matters.

You know what I think would be great, is if BV was too  see how much of an ass you've made of yourself, and your company in this futile argument.  Let him see exactly why his royalty checks or whatever your call it, from the sales of your VESC 6 are plunging in their amount, and then see how he wants to proceed in a business relationship with you.  I think he would be much better served working with someone like @stewii than someone who's word isn't worth the paper it's printed on.

Feel free to keep bullshit yourself and act like this is some altruistic fight over high design, and not simply a very greedy man who had low morales and lies, cheats, and steals others hard work. 

You keep talking about 1:1 design copy, well the only thing I have seen thus far that fits those standards is the trucks you copied, which you practically admitted to.  

Well, today the others will start to uncover your lack of patents and registrations and whatnot, so dare I say, this is the beginning of the end of your greedy monopoly over the HW 6.  I hope you have just thousands of units ready to go and be sold...  Chances are, you won't be selling too many of them anymore, so you can take that financial hit out of your end, as all this is your dilusional doing.

Schematics may be posted ages ago online. But the fact that the schematics didn't specifically say what dimensions the circuit board are. But many developers see that the PCB at it's current stage is already quite compact. 

And since the forumers who did their own HW6.4 based on the schematics, it isn't a direct copy. It is used as a reference. A direct copy is when a person had the exactly same pin in and pin out connections. Exact means 100%. If it isn't 100%, it is used as a reference.

As much as I hate to sound sarcastic, the fact that you had the privilege to work with BV and then go about bitching to people about originality and innovation, you are not in the correct position. You simply made your design based on the circuitry that BV supplied you to work with.

I'm gonna put in my 2 cents on this topic and I btw read the whole thing from post #1...

I'm gonna approach this topic from the BMS perspective. With the @raphaelchang and his Battman and me and my FlexiBMS projects. Let's see if we can draw some parallels in this case.

Battman:
![image|690x215](upload://gMoN2xc2PzXz1qmhFIEYXr6e8xW.jpg)

FlexiBMS 0.1:
![image|690x478](upload://hOX3b7qBealbKri0IoxhjVFamnR.png)

I doubt a few would say with a glance at the two boards above, that they are the same product. But fact is my pre-apha prototype (white board below) shared quite a lot with the Battman, but the fact is the project has evolved to a very different direction from there. Based on the performance tests I found some things lacking have then been trying to improve some of the blocks on the board on the component level. Now the whole design concept has changed very distinctively from Raphael Chang's creation, with the separation of the discharge control board to it's own module. This has been developed further on the concept level with the feedback from the community. I doubt there would be any chances to mix-up the two boards now. I suppose this is what @trampa is meaning by differentiating the design. Still a BMS, but different approaches. 

![IMAG0885|626x500](upload://jl8S5nWnQHbUPR2Jgpp5Xt5ECEs.jpg)

Personally I couldn't copy someones product 1:1. I would feel just scummy, so I made my own board first based on the "reference design" (Battman), learned how it worked and how to work it and then improved from there in the areas I found lacking and now it has become it's own thing.

EDIT: Note, I bought 2 VESC6s from a forum member recently for 450€ total and I still feel the pain...

Quite different!
Battman was an unproven and untested? design. Vesc6 was not! The design is very efficient and compact. And I wanted a square shaped product.

My pcb design is not 1:1 copy

But who came up with this layout anyway?

I went through this whole thing with a former customer. The lawyers got involved and as a result I learned this,

For there to be any design infringement whatsoever, the design needs to be exactly the same in all dimensions. Changes to the size or shape from one design to the next render them seperate and therefore not infringing on each other.

Yes this has been covered in earlier posts, but I'm completely confused by the fuss being created here. 

Patent law is different because it covers the method of operation, regardless of cosmetic design, but if a product isn't patented then even that is open season because you can simply move a few vitals to left or right, or change the size of some components to effectively create a brand new product.

If you cheaped out on patent filing, ie didn't do it, then it's your own fault if it gets copied. 

Otherwise you need to show the two (in this case) objects and demonstrate that they are identical in form. If they aren't, too bad again.

Fancy words and threats count for nothing if you can't show that the two designs are identical in every way.

btw the way, my former customer lost his case against me, but it was expensive for both parties, and wasted a LOT of my time and energy :frowning:

I've said this for a long time. Keep on keeping on. I would have done exactly what you did Stan - ordering pcbs and building for the community. But I'm lazy. But proud owner of 4 I built. 

In the end there is only a handful trampa can really argue with - and I mean no offense but it is @Ackmaniac as he has modified the code, distribted it, but not released the source in compliance with GPL. 

Mind you that regards software. Hardware is fair game, especially since there is no reference design publicly available, only the schematic. Meaning only changes to the schematic must be released. 

In the past we have 4.12 modified hardware, which released all Gerber's. Modifications to the hardware should be released as well, so for example Entertion Focbox, is a modification of 4.12, while not publicly available, you can email Entertion for these files. 

It all matters what the originator has released. And the originator only released a schematic... Sooooo

I heard about all this tramp bull months ago when I heard about some guys on Facebook getting a threatening letter from them. This issue is wider than this forum and Trampa has been threatening the whole industry with this crap. Maybe they should be recognized for being the bottleneck for innovation here, regardless if their AT boards are the best on the market or not, their reputation, even before this revealing thread, was a shit show...someone has to point it out and I'm fairly new and objectionable...they are hurting the industry they are apart of and it makes no sense at all..does anyone have a better theory other than ignorant protectionism and greed? I would like to think industry leaders like this had more sense and substance..pretty sad show guys..not sexy at all..and it's been going on for what? A whole year now? when you gonna all put a stop to it? Protecting your innovations from people copying it is one thing, but when it's not even really your innovation and open source...then you just look like a douche..like a whinny troublemaker...how about Trampa put it's money where it's mouth is and make one of those "other ways" and then patent it or something if they want this threatening position so badly they are willing to lie for it? . I personally work with some people in this industry and avoid people just like this...its about the skating anyway, its about the fun, not the greed..

On a side note, Avenue trucks has a patent on their suspension truck design, and they are working on an electric specific badass version for us. But in the mean time Acton Global already stole the idea, and unashamed asked how to get around the patent after refusing to pay for the design. They went on to create an unsafe and crappy version anyway, not only stealing a patented idea but threatening to ruin the reputation of suspension trucks through a horribly implemented version now in the hands of the consumer...and you guys are sitting here bitching and whining about open source? come on...

The purpose behind the U.S. patent process is A.) So the rich can protect their wealth by patenting all their designs because they have the money to, and B.) So that we can have COMPETITIVE pricing on items like paperclips because if one jackass claimed that he bent the first little metal rod into a paperclip then he would have a total monopoly on the paperclip market and could charge outrageous prices (errr.... $350) because he is the only one who can make paperclips, and if you don't buy from him, good luck at fastening that 30 page research paper together for a teacher that requires paper clips so she can look through it easily.

Regarding us 'sitting here bitching and whining about open source, come on', I hardly feel you have the right to pass judgement on us regarding this first and foremost, I don't think anyone had any idea this was happening, I certainly didn't, and I am a big fan of them.  Further more, this issue were bitching about has been going on for over a year, and if you can't understand the reasons behind our reactions to what just went down, I don't even know what to say to that.  It's a fucked up situation that was extremely costly and even legal action and threats were made, so it's not like we were bitching over a non issue, it's a very big issue.  As is the Avenue trucks issue, but once again, I don't think hardly anyone knew about it, so please don't act all self righteous implying what your protesting against has more of less implications than what we were protesting.

That's probably true actually, no one knows about it...the people who do hear about it don't speak up and the people who get the letters haven't been saying anything...like its a big secret or something...it's really not a secret though because I'm a nobody and I heard all about it..for a very long time..it's like people are afraid of looking like complainers or being labeled as negative when the source of the issues are clear..just communicate what is going on...I can tell you all that anyone close to using the name vesc, or thinking of making a new esc is being threatened by Trampa...and I thought it was an open source thing. I wonder if Hobbyking got a letter from trampa, that would be funny...it would most likely bounce off their legal department like a bug on a windshield..but yeah, why isn't it more widely known what is going on? why don't people talk about it?

Such guidelines might be hurting the growth of the industry by hiding the truth which aids in correcting that very market and industry and keeps it on the path it thinks it's on...we need a space to air the truth, as painful as it might be...and this isn't bashing Trampa, in fact I believe they make the standard for AT boards internationally and everyone knows this...why they are throwing down their reputation for a esc is beyond my intelligence, from my seat they need to foster and develop what they are known for and good at and let the esc people be esc people and innovate without threats..What happens when the hobbywing factory gets word there's room for innovation in this new market of electric surfboards or something? Trampa will be nothing but a speed bump for a company who's been making esc's for decades for all use cases...it just doesn't make any sense why they would, or a person, would fight this to the point they doom their own business reputation...here in California it happens too, big companies in the skateboard industry strong arm people all the time..with a smile...as a demographic builders are a little smarter than the average consumer though and knowledge is power..maybe trampa just fail to analyze it's audience well enough before speaking? Maybe they have it in them to back track and make it right after realizing the error of the adventure?

Couldn't agree more about Trampa, that's why it was so infuriating and down right confusing why he kept digging himself deeper and deeper with these stupid claims and design...

Regarding the guidelines, you would be safe in making that new topic.  They mainly just don't want to have threads that are like "this company took forever to ship me my products" or " this company said this but this is what really happened" and so on.... Just avoid those kinds of posts.  In regards to what you said you discovered, I would definitely like to see that thread stated cause I really want to see Avenue make an Esk8 truck and these knock offs as you said are dangerous.

It is quite easy: 

- Use your brand to market your products and respect the VESC-Brand's terms and conditions.
- Try to design the device yourself and offset the design from your competitions design.

This would also mean to stay clear of @stiwiis design if he decides to manufacture a more 
stiewii unique device.

And make a form factor that is 
- not the length or width of an 18650 and easy to fit in with batteries
- a complete design change, as if the separation of EMF zones isn't important. There is a reason for the L.. bet you didn't even know there was a reason for the L


Third, before you even started working with Vedder he released the "predesign" of the VESC5 which was originally a split board design, and changed to L shaped board. This inspired FOCbox and esk8.de for L shaped PCB before even YOU came out with an Lshaped pcb

Eat your own words. Look at the history. You took a design that was handed to you, and now you are tying to claim it like you own it. You do not. Go home Frank.

Stewii and bimmer both branded their ESC as the ESCape and B-Box and also respected the VESC T&Cs.
Stewii designed the PCB based on BV's schematics and also gave his list of the BOM in his own thread. He did changes to the design (the connectors are in different places).

In his thread before the ESCapes are made available for sale, several forumers helped to also design enclosure for the ESCape.

We shall not go down the path of name-calling and cyberbullying. Just fact checking his words will be enough to let the people do their judgement. I was actually prepping to gather parts to build my second board and was contemplating getting the T*ampa Gummies but it is out of stock for a month or two.

But seeing such things happen and how he persistently insist on this issue is just quite sickening. Oh well, guess I have to take my monies elsewhere. I'm pretty sure T*ampa doesn't feel the pinch since I'm just a single entity out of many.

I've been reading this whole thread throughout the day and I have to say that this is probably one of the most beautiful, positive, and uplifting things I have ever read on this forum. 
Keep liking them legumes brother!

It's ok because if it was called a tuber or a legume it would still be a potato. And everyone can grow them because they're open source from the best originator: earth. She even let's us crossbreed and make them slightly different and doesn't complain I grew them instead of a farmer..

Oh the puns...

I'll go with the spoon...a simple eating utensil.. although sometimes I use a piton, does use case count for anything? Can I make a VESC for scooters and not get a Trampa Gram in teh black mail? I mean snail mail? cus like, they only use them on skateboards? or what about bikes? and if we look into a mirror and say VESC VESC VESC enough times does Bill Cosby pop out with some jello holding a letter from Trampa?

So, I think you guys have beat this specific topic to death.  But at this point name bashing isn't getting anywhere, it's falling on deaf ears.  

HW 6x isn't the future of the vesc.  

I think as far as skateboards are concerned it's close to everything needed but not quite.  Maybe this wasted energy could be diverted into what we're looking for in HW 7 or whatever.  Such as higher voltage, built in AS., Built in BT.  Increase in continuous amp draw.  Which we are close to the current limit of battery technology (liion) anyways if we add more vesc to the board. Water resistant components/enclosure,  Better fet cooling from the beginning.  All of which have been discussed before.  But instead of looking ahead we are just digging holes.

No DRV8302 IC to blow.  100V maximum instead of 63V.  Built-in antispark switch but separate 5V output

why is this conversation still happening? To sell new brands of VESCs?

Names are trademarked. Logos are trademarked. Slogans are trademarked and brands are trademarked. Sometimes words are trademarked if they relate to a brand or a meaning. 

Hardware does not get trademarked. Hardeware gets patented. VESCs are not patented by Trampa or anyone else. 

Make all you want, improve it all you want, but call it something else.

Examples of more useful and less annoying questions:
how do i wire two lipos in series?
can i put two motors on my ESC?
Any advice on how to solder these old laptop cells into a pack?
If i have one finger in my butthole already, will there be room for more later?

Absolutely. There is always room for more with proper lubrication.  My wife and I normally lean towards coconut oil for all the quality health benefits. However, any lube will do.

Pressure+LOC (lube of choice)+ Time= more fingers in butthole.  

It is quite simple really.
