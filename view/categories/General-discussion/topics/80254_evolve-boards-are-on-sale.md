The Evolve boards are only good for about 1000 miles (1609km) and are completely useless by 3000 miles (3219km)

And they cannot get a single drop of water on them, ever

And then you can't use the electronics for anything at all or upgrade them without replacing everything.

You'd be far better off getting a Metroboard or making your own esk8

Evolve = Shit

I might add that I personally like the Evolve supercarve trucks, though that opinion is not shared by everyone.  But their electronics and battery are crap.

"31 mile range" :rofl::rofl:

With few exceptions: salvage their hardware (trucks, wheels, decks, enclosure...certain mounts) and the rest, as Brian says, is crap.

Take all that and you can use it as starting point for other DIY builds. Trow away everything electronic: remotes, batteries, VESC, BMS, receivers, cabling, etc. because is junk.

The motors aren't horrible.  At least they are compatible with other things.

But for some reason 'theirs' always break. Racestars, which are basically the same, always work flawless. Weird.

How much would a Carbon GT deck be worth to you?  There is a [Gen2 Carbon AT deck](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/evolve-carbon-gen-2-deck-and-enclosure/65399) for sale right now

I have a Carbon GT deck but I wasn't planning to sell it at this time

In that regard we can conclude that Evolve is a great hardware manufacturer and a terrible electronic outsourcer (because we all know they don't produce electronically shit)

A Carbón GT on the hands of a good builder who knows what to do with it could become your next rocket.

Totally agree with you guys. Total shit. My buddy made his better by replacing all electronics and battery (10S6P 30Q). Now it's an eboard worthy of riding. Better just build from scratch without wasting the initial money.
