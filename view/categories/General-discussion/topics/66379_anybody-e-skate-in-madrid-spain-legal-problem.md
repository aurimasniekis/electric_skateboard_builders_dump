Hi everyone,

Just wanted to see if anyone has any experience e-boarding in Madrid, Spain. I will be moving there in 2 weeks and want to bring mine along :rofl: 

It seems to be a gray area legally? Anyone had any problems, issues? 

Thanks guys,

Marcus

Hola, I think there is not much a problem if you ride normally, but still, is not legal, just is a hole in the law to be determined if it's go legal, actually the city is infested with scooters from Xiaomi and no problem at all. Anyway good to mention @tueboard he is from Madrid, also check [www.esk8foro.es]
