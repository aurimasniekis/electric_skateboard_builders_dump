Hi guys,

I am planning to put those pieces together:

1x [Jet Spud 29"](https://buildkitboards.com/products/jet-spud-29-bkb)
1x [Dual HUB Motor 90*52mm 1000W75KV Power Truck & Front Truck Kit](http://www.diyeboard.com/dual-hub-motor-9052mm-1000w75kv-power-truck-front-truck-kit-p-558.html)
1x [BMS HCX-D223V1](http://bestechpower.com/37v10spcmbmspcbforli-ionli-polymerbatterypack/PCM-D223V1.html)
2x VESC6
[10s4p Samsung Q30](https://www.nkon.nl/samsung-inr-18650-30q-3000mah.html)
1x [Simple 3D-printed NRF remote](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/simple-3d-printed-nrf-remote-arduino-controlled/28543)

Do you think 40 of the 18650 batteries are a good decision or is it too heavy? I really don't want the board to [break](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/uploads/db1493/optimized/3X/4/f/4f70d18aab9697c8cf59e5530793deb3275b0254_1_666x500.jpg)

My weight is 90 kg (198 lbs). Please let me know your opinion about this config.

```
the weight of your batteries won't break the board

No problem at all...is not 1kg more from battery that will brake your board. I am doing a similar build with jet spud and hub motors. I also have the BMS nex to the battery (10s3p) and I already use all the space available...I think yuo should move it on top of the battery to make it fit. Yes, you will need a bit higher enclosure but it's feasable.

just to understand...a little spoiler ![image|690x387](upload://wUwRAFa4wTq9z40TKmgVIjE0AE1.jpg)
