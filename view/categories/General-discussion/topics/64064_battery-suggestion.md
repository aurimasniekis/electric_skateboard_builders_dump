Hello just to have some advice from you guys :grinning:
https://m.ebay.com/itm/3-7V-8000-mAh-7566125-LiPo-Li-ion-Polymer-Rechargeable-Battery-/332528551331
Is this battery fake ? 8Ah seems high for 5 bucks (others sellers sell it for ~15 bucks)
If it it a "real" battery, does someone know the C-rating of this battery ? 

Sorry if my English isn't perfect, I'm French

these are ion batteries despite being in a pouch.  it doesnt state the discharge ability but likely very low.  good for a computer and its fan not a powerful motor.
