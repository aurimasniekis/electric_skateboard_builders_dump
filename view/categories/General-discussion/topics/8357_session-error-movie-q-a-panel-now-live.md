For those in the Michigan area - on Thursday September 15th, we'll be screening my latest short documentary "Session Error: The Rise & Risk of Electric Skateboarding" followed by a Q&A. The event is FREE but please RSVP in the link below because seating is limited. We'll also have a display area with our e-boards for the post screening mixer where the audience will be able to interact with the A2ESK8 crew and learn more about ESK8 and riding safely. I'm working on live streaming the event as well for those who can't make it.

I was going to do it at Michigan Theater but they are under renovations. Weekday because it's more cost effective. If I had to rent a theater on a weekend I'd have to charge for tickets. Keeping it free is ideal. Many of the people who are RSVP'ing have never been exposed to ESK8 before and we're looking to partner up with a few local kid/teen organizations to give them some exposure to e-board safety. My goal is for the takeaway to be that ESK8 is thrilling as hell! Just be safe about it.

Infiniditto. I definitely want to see this and I'm sure it will be a great film. Probably wouldn't be a bad idea to make watching this movie or even a condensed version a prerequisite for joining the forum or buying a new board. Kind of like a mandatory public service announcement. Might feel kind of nanny statish, but obviously it's not on a lot of people's radars until someone gets hurt or dies.

@Mobutusan hopefully this will be shared with our friends and loved ones and bring the discussion of safety out of these forums and into our living rooms. You're right it isn't on a lot of people's radars. Even when I first started, safety was always ingrained in our local crew and of course the one single time that one of us forgot to wear a helmet is when tragedy struck. ESK8 is still early in its culture to make safety as part of the experience and not just an afterthought. But we all have to be a part of it and we all have to look out for each other.

@oneafrikan @JLabs @Nordle yup already on it :) September 15th stay tuned!

Hey Guys, just a reminder that we will be launching the film along with the live stream Q&A panel of the event at 7pm EST which will be held at Duo Security's tech event space here in Ann Arbor, MI. I'll have my laptop close to me so occasionally I'll be able to take some online questions about the film.

For those who are local be sure to RSVP as we have only a few seats left - http://bit.ly/sessionerrormovie

Feel free to share the link around to anyone who skates or is interested in tech/eboarding. I think the big theme of tech and responsibility is where I'm hoping to steer the conversation towards. We can start with ESK8 but it could go as far as Electric Cars.

Hey Guys, just a heads up we will be screening a few promos and trailers along with a 20 min documentary right before "Session Error" so look for the main event to begin around 7:30 EST. I'll be active on here and YouTube in case you want to chat. Once I hit the stage for Q&A feel free to send questions in the YouTube and Landon will read them out loud for the audience.

The Q&A video will take awhile to process but should be up sometime tomorrow. Just want to thank all you guys on here and watching on the YouTube live stream. I know many of us have never met in person but yet I feel connected to ya'll through your online personalities, social posts and personal DIY builds. I know there's plenty of lively debates and occasional ego clashing but I think what transcends all of that is the fact that none of us ever want to see anyone get hurt in ESK8. As you can tell, it's changed me in many ways. Looking out for each other and keeping each other safe just takes common sense and intuition. We have the power to influence our culture and how ESK8 will be perceived in the mainstream and for the next generation. Let's not let a bunch of sales directors do that for us.

Basically after the accident, it was really hard for me to look at that build, let alone ride it. Right before Maker Faire I had @LEVer convert them into two singles and I put one on my vintage double kick build and the other back on my Jet Spud. Not many of us are big dudes except for @Jeff who has the most powerful dual build. But the single hubs are fine for our meetups and simple commuting since most of Michigan is mostly flat.

Well done! 

Being a life long skater and having had my share of injuries, it really hit home. Never had a traumatic injury like that, but been close many times. I didn't skate with a helmet until just after I started Esk8ing and thankfully I did. My head hit pavement a few months later. A couple years later I still have shoulder pain as constant reminder of how much worse that accident could have been. Thanks to a helmet I walked away from it to spend another day with my wife and kids like it was just another day of skating.

This video is important for our community. I'm sure it will make the difference between at least one of us being here and not being here.

Rik, thanks for sharing your work with us.  It was very moving. I have left my helmet home far too many times, so this really hit home.

@RunPlayBack . Very important movie. Thanks for sharing. Change will come, but slowly I think. As for CN he has hes own risk rating and seems very careless. I seriously doubt he would ever convert to a helmet as it gets away from his brand image. Even if he saw your video I dont think he would change. What gets me is he has a daughter and should set a good example albet shes only like 2 and wouldnt know the difference.

@E-Boarding @Dedbny yup I agree, it will take awhile for safety awareness to be ingrained in the culture of ESK8 and as I mentioned in the Q&A, it will take a high profile celebrity to get seriously hurt or killed to get any major media coverage on the topic. CN is an amazing entertainer/filmmaker but I still feel like the responsibility lies in Boosted's hands if they want him to wear a helmet. Where are the Boosted helmets in his unboxing videos? The companies and creators need to do more to get their influencers to ride responsibly because they are the ones the kids are emulating. At this point we have to look out for each other because most of these companies don't want to discuss the reality of risk. I even wonder if any of the vendors will chime on this thread or is this not a strong enough issue to discuss?

Casey is a horrible influence when it comes to safety. He's an adult and probably have a knowledge of how to take a fall, but a lot of his fans are teenagers who are getting those awful MelonBoard and LectricLongboards and going 18+mph with no helmet then applying that abrupt brake. Many of whom say "I have never been on a skateboard before"

That's exactly why sharing this with him could have a big impact.

I believe CN is like a non paying sponsor.  Hes happy with the product and if Boosted send him boards hes happy to promote it.  In one of his vids hes at B HQ and everyone else has a helmet on and Im sure he would have been offered a B branded helmet.  But no CN is to conscious about image to put one one.  It has to become a natural thing and @runplayback and your guys are starting to get ppls mind set to do it naturally.  I wouldnt have thought to ride all the time with a helmet,  but id do it with a bicycle.  

Does just need more public influencers to wear them to promote the image,  but its not going to be CN.

CN can do what he wants. Boosted sends him boards and other goodies. While he may not be earning a paycheck from Boosted, getting a free $1500 board is a pretty nice perk. Boosted could at least send him a helmet so that when he does his unboxing, out pops a helmet. Or when he rode with the Boosted crew, they could have made him wear a helmet.

@mrmoonlight They probably did say to put on a helmet, but he still chose not to thats what Im trying to say. Hes an adult. If hes not wanting to put on a helmet its a tad difficult.

Honestly it's really stupid, and he rides in a way which would get him seriously hurt... I would've hoped that after his crash, he would've taken a hard look for the sake of his daughter and wife. 

Also a point- I remember the first video (or maybe second) CN saying that it was so fast and should definitely wear a helmet, and DID, but then the next day didn't, I recently went looking for that video, and it's gone. Scary shit, can't even advocate learning in a safe way...

Now I honestly don't really care if he was to wear a helmet or not, because people can make their own decisions, but he had millions of followers... he should set a good example, at least tell people it's a good idea to and wear one when learning. I agree board should come with helmets (or at least a heavily enforced optional one)

I love Casey but I hope he gets in a crash (worse than before) so that he gets the bigger picture.

The footage of the fall is crazy and shows just how easy it is to get whipped. Its actually looks pretty minor from a distance, but you know at that speed it was intense.

The Boosted team could just say,"sorry, we can't ride with you unless you put on a lid." CN is a professional. I'm sure he would be quite understanding that Boosted, being a company that sells e-boards, would feel the need to promote safe usage of their product. It's a safety and liability issue. 

I hope it never happens, but it's likely that one day, one of these e-skate companies will have a lawsuit filed against them by some family who's kid got seriously injured for not wearing a helmet. The fine print may be saying wear a helmet, but when the marketing is showing a bunch of people sans helmets, there's some serious inconsistencies.

The second you put a motor on a traditionally non-motorized mode of transportation, you should be wearing a helmet. Would anyone ride a motorcycle these days without a helmet (I know some will, but I mean, seriously). It's just stupid. If your going to ride in a city, it's not just speed or turns at speed that can kill you, but cars.  I've seen a few videos of himriding the boosted board around NY, and they way he rides, it will just be a matter of time.

I think it's pretty normal to wear a full face helmet if your a serious downhill longboarder... I think we've all seen the video of the guy face planting without one, but his buddies were wearing helmets, and almost any video I watch on youtube, even the guys going 45 mph in short sleeve shirts and pants, are wearing a full face helmet.

Maybe if we can convince people your increasing performance by increasing aerodynamics :stuck_out_tongue:
(which I think is somewhat true with full face helmets like the tsg pass)

Im not a law expert, but dont think theres a law that says you have to wear a helmet for an eboard. If the board is sold with some disclainer its user beware. They cant be responsible for your injury if you dont yourself take all the neccessary care as required. Ie riding at night without lights. Thats just dumb.

And lets lot advocate for CN to get hurt, as another poster said, but I know what he was tryong to say. Its only a matter of time. And yes he tried a helmet, but it didnt make him look good in vids. Go figure. Hes use to lying in hospital, but doesnt still hasnt learnt. I thInk enough said about CN.

@Dedbny @Mrmoonlight yeah definitely inconsistencies with disclaimers and actual product videos. Boosted seems to get it right in their videos but not always in their stills. For example:

https://www.instagram.com/p/BGZfdElHVUG/?taken-by=boostedboards

https://www.instagram.com/p/BCOPdcOHVSR/?taken-by=boostedboards

That last one is a very familiar scene all over Michigan. Whole families who will cycle together with only the kids wearing helmets. As if the older you get, the less injury prone your brain will be. It doesn't send the right message.

You can file a lawsuit despite what any disclaimer says. Yes, certain things like riding at night without lights would probably not go very far, but riding without any safety gear even though they have a disclaimer is a bit different. Many of these companies actively promote riding without a safety gear through their vids and images. I don't think I've seen a Yuneec EGO vid that they've put out where their riders are wearing helmets. Evolve and Boosted are both very good when it comes to their vids, but I agree, their stills are littered with riders without helmets and many engaging in fairly extreme looking riding.

Basicly it says that you can´t see the movie here in Germany because of some licensed music you´re using in it :frowning:
