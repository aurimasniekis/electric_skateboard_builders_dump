Hey ya'll, it's been awhile. Just a heads up, my ESK8 film "Session Error: The Rise & Risk of Electric Skateboarding" is now streaming on Amazon Prime. Maybe you've seen it, maybe not. But if you were able to take something from it, please leave us a review - good or bad. Apologies for the plug, just wanted to let you know where to watch in case you couldn't find it. Peace!

If you type really fast, sometimes Discourse thinks you're a bot. Found you and all squared away now.
