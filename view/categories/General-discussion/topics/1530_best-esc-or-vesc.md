What in your opinion is the best esc on the market, or vesc? I want you to consider ease of setup and how long it has lasted without blowing, or needing to be replaced. Remember I just want to know your choice, the cost, and durability of the product(overheating, blowing up, and such).

@willpark16 VESC all the way. Even with the added effort to configure it, there's just no comparison in terms of customizability. I also like that improvements are constantly being made to it, so new firmware releases can mean better performance in the future. You can tune it to perform in just about any way you want. 

That said, you have to enjoy the learning process to make it really shine. If you have no interest in tinkering with the numerous settings and learning how they impact your ride, another ESC option might be better for you.

I agree the VESC is superior in all aspects, except maybe in reliability. There are just too many breakdown stories. Or perhaps only the VESC breakdowns make it to the forum, creating a skewed perception.
I wonder how many VESC users have a zero breakdown record.

The only esc on the market that did FOC or sine wave commutation before the vesc came out was like 450$ from Germany and it still didn't have nearly the features that the vesc has and it's bigger.  There's not a single category the vesc doesn't win in. The more I find out the more it does blow everything away. 

No breakdowns I've heard of from the vesc but I've read of a couple instances of motors breaking. All of which need not have happened.

**You hit the nail on the head!**

 - Most people don't come to forums and create a post "I got me vesc & it works perfect"

I've done the sums on enertion sales and official failure rates are around 3% (this includes returns from the first ever massed produced VESC batch that had wrong different brand of shunts & caps)

Also, there are some people who just don't know how to get the VESC working, so they claim that it's faulty but it turns out to be fine... So some documented "faults" are actually just user error.

**if you search the Hobbyking forums for "faulty broken ESC" there are 2440 result pages.**
see for yourself: https://www.google.com/search?as_q=&as_epq=ESC&as_oq=faulty+broken&as_eq=&as_nlo=&as_nhi=&lr=&cr=&as_qdr=all&as_sitesearch=hobbyking.com%2Fhobbyking%2Fforum&as_occt=any&safe=images&as_filetype=&as_rights=


**WOW that's a lot of faulty hobbyking ESC!... they must be unreliable right?** But how many have been sold that never failed? We don't have their sales figures so we don't know.... so anything we say about overall reliability is an unfounded guess.


----------


**So what about the VESC?**

I have never had a vesc just fail for no reason, if they work they tend to keep working very well, all the fails I have witnessed first hand are due to my mistakes or manufacturing issues that have meant it never worked in the first place... all this doesn't really matter because from the 3 or 4 existing VESC suppliers, they all have a warranty that offers repair, replacement or credit.

On the other hand, say when you buy an ESC from hobbyking, One that is designed to work on a toy car that weighs less than 5kg and it fails then what do you say to them? It broke because i used it for a skateboard? Do you think they will offer Warranty? **They Don't!** 

*They also clearly say the don't*

Below is copied from their FAQ page:

> -HobbyKing.com Service Centers don’t accept crash, damaged parts of the items due to **misuse, and items that have been modified.**
> -HobbyKing.com accepts no responsibility for the **improper installation and use** of purchased products.

*This means that your ESC from hobbyking has no warranty.*


So if anyone is planning to buy an ESC for use on an electric skateboard I would strongly suggest buying it from an Electric Skateboard Supplier so that you have a valid warranty for use on an electric skateboard.

**$100 USD will get you a vesc delivered to your door! & it comes with a valid warranty**

EZRun 150A car esc. $100
Config on the fly
Never overheated, even with no fan.
No failures.
Spashproof.

Running my board and a friend's. Never had an issue with either. Particularly good with lower voltage setups like 6s.

I suspect your low return rate is partly affected by the fact you are in Australia. I have two that should have been returned but my friend couldn't be bothered (his lookout - I would have sent them back, but it illustrates the point).

Here is a simple analogy, 

Do you know how to install a driver for a wireless network (or any piece of hardware) card into your PC and setup an internet connection?

If you have the knowledge to perform that kind of installation you will be able to work out how to connect the vesc and configure it.

If you don't feel confident doing basic stuff like how to install a driver and connect a piece of hardware you will get lost with the VESC.

**However, All the VESC I sell come preconfigured with R-SPEC & SPACE CELL parameters, so if you buy this stuff together from me you can use them without the need to connect your PC or do any configuration.**

This is my VESC experience (and I'm a programmer and pretty competent with electronics)

- Hook VESC up to power - don't be tempted to use your main skate battery pack. So now you'll be hunting round for an alternative (if you havent got an alternative you'll probably take the risk anyhow).... because for some reasons, your VESC is a bit sensitive when being setup and easily fried...
- PLug it into your PC and install drivers.
- find (on guthub) and download the VESC software - once you realise you want the BLDC tool - which lives in "firmware" folders...
- you'll almost certainly have the wrong version and then be prompted to flash the firmware to the version that suits that software
- choose your firmware carefully because you were expecting to see a file like firmware_vesc_2.8 or such like. But you'll find a folder with about 8 firmwares in it. "default", "enertion", etc etc, and these are in several folders that are named 407 , 410, etc. Choose carefully or your VESC is dead. 
- Now you have the right firmware on your board it will now work with your PC.
- Now try motor autodetect, and if you don't fry your board because you used your main battery pack, then you are good to go - well, after you have figured out your max amps, max braking amps, regen amp, etc. Plus your voltage cut offs, plus your startup boost settings.
- Now it works !
- However, you are getting cut offs because either you set your battery limits wrong, or you've got your gearing wrong and overheating the chips - (but you have no way to tell for sure unless you skate with a laptop plugged in). You can now tweak the battery cut off voltages, but not whilst you are skating - you have to go home and do it on your laptop. Probably a few times to get it right.

You need patience, and all the while, making sure you don't short out a very exposed circuit board.

The VESC offers smooth startup, and most importantly, smooth acceleration - but it is not for a beginner with no patience.

Not sure about "professional" comments - but i'll comment anyway...  ;)

90kv shouldn't be an issue.  Amp draw might be an issue - do you know any usage info for that motor in your use case?

VESC would still be my starting point.  There's little use getting a $200+ motor and slapping a $35 rc car ESC to power it...

I would start out around 8s and get it working well.  12s for that low kv _probably_ will work well, but if it feeds back a significant voltage regen i could see it possibly causing an issue.  That's the technical side of VESC i just can't really comment on.  Not with any authority.  I would ask on vedder.se if you want to confirm.  But you will need to know some of the motor tech specs at the least to give them enough info to help.

How DIY savvy are you?  can you do SMD soldering/repair?  If so, i'd get a couple spare DRV chips and give it a go!  If that's not something you're comfortable doing - i might ask Torque if his DIYes 12s ESC would work.

One thing i always think folks forget is just how capable the VESC is for the voltage it allows.  Go look for a >6s RC ESC.  Besides some of the HK one's with minimal configuration - they get $$$!  Mamba XL2 only does 8s and is $200-250! as one example.

The mamba costs more but it doesn't fry chips @80a like the vesc. It'll handle 160a. And it must be said...You won't have to wait 2-3 months to get it and then another 2 months to replace/repair it. Time is friggen money.

The EZrun Max 5 is also available and works up to 200a @8s

They do.
Mamba XL2 8s

EZrun Max 6 160a 8s
EZrun Max 5 200a 8s

Nobody needs to run 12s. It is an extravagance, It hasn't added mileage or top speed so whats the point?  From my window 12s has added mostly just complications.

The most reliable DIY builds have been 6-8s. 
Easier/cheaper charging solutions too!

Understand what you are saying man.  I have only killed my VESC through misuse and not understanding what i was doing.  It's also nice that i have 3 or 4 spares right now for future project boards...  Not everyone would have a backup.

I tried the Mamba for a short time and wasn't able to get the brakes working well enough to stop me at slow speeds (wasn't willing to go full speed until it stopped me correctly at slow speed!).  So it's in the box as well collecting dust.  It and a spare XERUN.  One day i'll dust it off for a project board, or throw it on the for sale section.

Agree on the 8s is plenty too.  I run 8s all the time on GF's board and even single motor it moves me along just fine.  

I'm OK playing with the bleeding edge of the VESC - 12s and FOC.  Once i have my next board setup i'll play with this more (can't break the GF's board).  And i'll have the DRV chips to replace if i fry them...  And get to practice my SMD skills...  Win Win sorta.

I bought 2 VESC's both 4.7 one of them immediately broke. (10s/dual Tacon bigfoot) Chaka repaired it and sent it back and I haven't had many issues since. Though, I haven't ridden it much either because of my knee. I haven't tried the vesc with a low kv motor and urethane wheels. My experience is with pneumatics. That said, I love FOC! But, in every setting the vesc is slow with acceleration and top speed when compared to my EZ's and Mamba's.

@sl33py @psychotiller  i've ordered all the parts (still waiting for it) as I am planning to diy myself a hub motor (similar to @Hummie). Not for commercial purpose. I guess the only main difference is the size (I'm grabbing 6825 instead of 4725).12s 90kv n48sh most probably 40-50 amps (vesc was my benchmark, but still reluctant)..i haven't actually get the spec sheet from the custom stator manufacturer yet...hummies and Pedi's hub are my "reference" as I see their hubs working beautifully with 12s and vesc...should I wait for v6.0? I guess I should ask at vedder's site...haha...wheels I guess around 95mm...btw, thanks for the feedback guys, TB's 12s ESC was on my list too, but I heard there's some braking prob too....

They are all based on the same design but are all manufactured by different people. Chaka hand builds his and are regarded as of higher quality because of this. Diy and enertion placed themselves into the lower price category and have a slightly lower quality component, but still good by any means.

That just doesn't make any sense at all. What you are saying is the cost of an ESC should be directly proportional to how much you spend on a motor - which is total baloney. If a $35 ESC works well enough, why wouldn't you use it? The price of it has no bearing on whether it's any good.

And whilst I agree that ESCs over 6s get pricey, I say this - stick to 6s. I'm still on 6s, and I gear down my boards to keep them under 20mph. Anything more is really seriously dangerous (dont' let anyone tell you otherwise). Going to 8s, 10s, 12s just increases your costs and complications.

No, actually i'm saying that getting a high performance motor that can do 12s and running it 4-6s on a car ESC, PLUS with poor timings and brake adjustment on the car ESC - is not giving you the performance you are spending on the motor.

going to 8s, 10s, 12s gives you **both power and better efficiency.**  Properly setup with an ESC that can be adjusted also can limit your top speed (Mamba and VESC have this).  back to my first point.  Leaving performance (and safety features) underutilized on a budget ESC.  It'll work, but you're not getting the full potential of that $$ motor.

I still don't see it.

On my single motor 6364 board, the motor capable of 10 s but I run it at 6s. I bought it because of its size. The fact it can handle 10s is neither here nor there. It didn't cost me more to buy a 10s capable motor. There was no 6s choice... 

A motors voltage rating is max limit, not a recommendation.  They don't run innefficiently at lower voltage, they just run slower.

I've  built three boards now. Two 6s and one 10s. My two 6s boards have clocked over 30mph but I have geared them down to 22mph. They run cool. One has a 15mile range (I'm 90kg). The other around 8 miles (much smaller batteries). The second board cost less than £400 all in. I don't want the "full potential of my motor".  That would mean around 40mph.

The 10s board I built for a mate has been nothing but trouble. The batteries are expensive and now out of production. It's got through three vescs.  Braking is erratic. You need a bec for any ancillaries. I went for 10s for the efficiency of increasing voltage and reducing amps. He also wanted a crazy top speed (which after coming off, he wisely never reaches) Under testing his board has a little over half the Mah of mine and does about half the range 8 miles). The theoretical efficiency increase is barely, if at all noticeable. 

The lust for high voltage, in my experience is just not worth it on these scales.

You probably can, but will either have no brakes, or brakes that come on when you let off the throttle.  Not good.  Some folks have found hacked firmware that will let them use heli/boat ESC's, so i'd search if you are looking for bottom dollar budget ESC.  Not a great idea in my book, but also understand you gotta work within your budget - just be careful given speeds we reach on esk8 and potential injury if your ESC dies at speed (and/or locks up brakes).

If you can swing it i'd go with one of the less expensive ESC's that have a good reputation.  I believe @lowGuido might recommend the x-car beast?  i've also heard good things about the FVT ESC's.  All car esc's as they have brakes and adjustments that work well for esk8.

Not having brakes is a dangerous thing on eSk8! It's easy to forget just how effortlessly an eSk8 can rack up speed, and with no way to dissipate it, you can get into some pretty sticky situations. My opinion is that the ESC is the most important component to not cheap out on, the battery coming second.

For a budget conscious ESC, you can try a car ESC from hobbyking, like the X Car 150A or the Trackstar 150A. Both can handle 6S, are programmable, and most importantly, have brakes. They even include an on/off switch, eliminating the need for an external switch!

For a bit more money, you can get a VESC from  for around $100, and have a much better ESC that will cover you all the way up to 12S should you want to upgrade, and has much smoother power delivery. I've tried both car ESCs and VESCs back to back, and the difference is quite striking!

Hope this helps!

I can recomend the X-car beast for 6S. I have used lots of them. never had one fail.

DO NOT use the trackstar ESC they are horrible and you will street your face.

also brakes are over rated. downhillers never had them and don't need them. in my experience most slams on electric boards come from people putting the brakes on too hard and eatting pavement. Foot drag or slide. by all means use electronic brakes to regulate your speed, but don't rely on them to stop or save you. thats asking for trouble.

Yeah @psychotiller the Hobbywing stuff is waterproof too, comes with a nice switch...
I'm waiting to see someone do a build with [XeRun XR8 Plus](http://www.hobbywing.com/goods.php?id=335&filter_attr=5426.5473) apart from also being sensor-ed it has some nice features. The kicker would have been if the [XeRun 4274 SD G2](http://www.hobbywing.com/goods.php?id=516&filter_attr=5420.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0) came in a usable kv for us but 2250 even at 6s is just too high :( We could have seen a few more MoeStooge style builds but with sensored motors.

As for the best ESC?
The [MGM](https://www.mgm-controllers.com/) lineup all look pretty awesome with kickass features like data logging in their top of the range units like the [TMM 25063-3 for Cars X2-SERIES PRO](https://www.mgm-controllers.com/cars/speed-controllers-escs/tmm-25063-3-for-cars-x2-series-pro.html).
A 5 year warranty is hard to beat too.
And their [LMT](https://www.mgm-controllers.com/cars/lmt-lehner-motors/lmt-3080-for-cars.html) motor range goes beyond the needs of eSk8...

Anybody for a motor with 6 phase connections? :joy:
