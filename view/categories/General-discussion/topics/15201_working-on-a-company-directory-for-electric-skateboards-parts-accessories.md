Hi Everyone,

I've recently began working on a company directory for the electric skateboarding community and looking to find specific online companies which sell parts, accessories and other electric skateboards. You can view it [here](http://www.eskatenation.com/directory).

As you can imagine there is a big list of companies and I was hoping that some of you may know of different companies I could add to the directory.

I've seen a few a threads already on the most commonly parts used but wanted to build a seperate site with the aim of providing information to all in a cleaner style.

I am hoping to get some feedback about the site and if there are any companies or categories I've maybe missed. I know there is probably a lot of companies on the market but the site is still in it's early stage so I'm sure you can understand.

Full disclaimer. I'm not affiliated, associated or connected with any of the companies which are linked on the page. The site itself is for informational purposes only and I'm not trying to make any monetary value from this. I've just noticed a void which I feel I'd like to dedicate some of my time too.

theres a few lists on reddit that have sheets of companies/brands that have popped up in the last few months...

i'm working on something similar wiki/glossary as part of [my site](http://esk8.today/references/). But there are tons of new Rebrand companies so I decided to only list the ones with actual unique products, and **customer service.**

since you're already going at it. i'm just gonna leave my list where it is, and link you for a full list. :wink:

@lox897 Thanks for the suggestions mate. I've added those to the directory.

@zmoney I'd be happy to add a VESC badge such like<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/3/1/315ce54638f89b64aaf5da3476b8d6423beeddb8.png" width="121" height="51">under the electronics category.

@saul Thanks for the list mate, I'll start going through them and adding them :slight_smile:

EPIC skateboards , (Thing in aus) torque boards since they sell completes now, and if you count kickstrters you can put leaf and buffalo boards
```

@Pathaim I've added EPIC Skateboards. I couldn't find Torque Boards anywhere, can you send me a link? In regards to kickstarter projects, I'm still trying to decide whether or not to include them because if you've noticed, sometimes when a kickstarter project fails, they don't always end up continuing the project. This isn't always the case always but I'm open to your/anyone's thoughts on this.

@Pathaim Have organised the electronics category a little more so it's more specific for those who sell VESC i.e.

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/f/d/fd7f619085c0b7fc42e15ad3ff626585cff307d4.png" width="690" height="262">

Also Marbel and Metroboard have already been added :slight_smile:

@trampa Added :slight_smile:

@rwxr Added most of the sites you suggested. Some of which were already on the directory. One of the issues though is a lot of the sites don't have a logo so just takes a little more time for each one to be added.

@mmaner Sounds like a good idea. I'll probably just have to manually keep check of that. I'm alright with html/css to an extent, so some things may take a little longer to figure out and perfect ;)

@zmoney Didn't realise you sold VESC's as you didn't mention it in your first comment. What's your site mate? A centered logo would be helpful as well (800x800 px).

Are you using MySQL?  If so you can "reorder" tables.  Take a look at this...
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1850594/mysql-how-to-reorder-a-table

You might be able to make a script that runs every hour to reorder the "name" table and everything that comes after using whatever your Instrumental ID field is.

@mmaner Little too advanced for me tbh. I'd like to be able to do something like that with ajax search as well but don't have the patience to learn it. You never know might be able to get some help in the future for stuff like that but for the time being I'll just make incremental changes.

I'd be glad to help, though honestly I would approach the vendor listing using a PHP app with MySQL as the Database server.  That's just me because its what I have always done and it works well.  If you wanna output a list with the relevant data I could throw something together for you that would have an admin panel for edits and reorders.

@esk8 Can you share you share a link of the decks esk8de sells, because I can't seem to verify that you you stock them.

@wmj259 Added.

@zmoney @lox897 Added :slight_smile:

@Esrapp21 Added "Hub Motors" sub-category and have added Carvon to the list however I haven't listed the others you suggested as Jacobs Hub Motors don't stock any of the items and I can't seem to find a site for Hummies Hub Motors.

one suggestion i have, when you click a company say enertion, it opens in a new tab instead of just redirecting? it makes it easier to stay on your site and browse multiple companies :slight_smile:

It's a good idea. One of the problems I was having was initiating the context menu with right click on the table row so will try to get that working soon.

Edit: @Pathaim @aigenic Fixed links and tested. They will now open in a new tab/window depending on browser :slight_smile:
