Hey I know a lot of people don't like this kit but it is my first esk8 and it got me into the hobby which I absolutely love so far and it's been a great start. So my question is I don't like the gear pulley for the wheels due to it seeming to not fit basically any larger wheels I'm looking at. Does anyone know if I can switch out the gear pulleys to a better set with more larger wheels options or not? Thanks in advanced.

possibly but I don't think you can raise the teeth count very much because the mounts are so short.  Better off making one from parts

Well that's what I was wondering , I've got caliber II trucks now, some dickho mounts on the way and I got some 90mm flywheel clones but the wheel gear doesn't quite fit. So wasn't sure if someone had done the swap or if it's easy as buying a new gear set and swapping over or not

The pulley doesn't fit the wheels or trucks?

The diyeboard pulley doesn't fit the wheel. It's just a tad bit too thick

Dicky has cheap wheel pulleys, you can also print them

I can switch out the gear pulleys
[/quote]

if you do your going to have to recalculate the belt size, the 250mm belts that come with the kit wont work

Seems like motor gear is 13t and the wheel gear is 35t with 50t belts 250-5. Not sure I used the calculation website and it seemed off. 2.33:1

```
Supposedly the center to center is around 60mm and a 13T pulley has a pitch diameter of 20mm so anything with a pitch diameter of less than 100mm should fit, that means anything up to 60T in theory

In fact I do mind, it's buried under a pile of dirty laundry and god knows what else.  Point still stands you can probably buy a 44T and use that, max is probably 64 before the pulleys touch

:roll_eyes: a bit large don't you think? 40t should be enough id say

the kit should fit 107's with the defualt config, all he needs to do is take off the pulley covers.

@Cnelson91 Tooth count to match speed with 107mm wheels is a 45T, anything lower adds speed

its fine though... although the kit with stock gearing and 107's wont have much torque.

That's about what I'm looking for. 100mm or higher due to the roads in Maine being horrible with debris and cracks. Or even the dickyho AT airless kit.

You can salvage the motors from the diye kit and use it on the dickyho off-road kit if you really want some ability to go on damaged roads, it will set you back just under $200 though...250 if you pick up some new motors

Yeah I think that's the route I'm looking to go. Due to the sudden change in roads here. Only question I have is if I go that route what sort of deck do I do? I've bought 3 decks so far and I think the bustin' maestro mini would be the closest to an "AT" board to fit those wheels

AT decks are not really a thing?  As long as you don't get wheel bite it's gonna work, or you could get the 11.4" hangars and literally ride a 10x1 wooden slab around

I have 2 propdrive 5060 270kv motors for sale 29usd each. Those with 2 @boardnamics mounts and the bangood link below for the beloe and belt set. You might want to buy a 12t 6mm bore pulley from ebay, but this method would be cheaper and more powerful. My motors are barely used. Theres a few small scratches. But otherwise flawless

No, just the motors i mean. They were  110 for the set brand new. They each were used for about 30-40miles i would geuss

That's honestly not a bad deal. I may take you up on that and start really building up an actual DIY board with all the decks I seem to keep buying and I've got the mounts on the way

belts and pulleys: $45
boardnamics mounts: $40
my ntm 5060 270kv motors: $58
caliber trucks: $30-40
generic abec flywheels 95mm: $30

total: $208 for all trucks, wheels, motors, pulleys, belts

much better than the 5055 270kv generic motors that are really pretty awful
the trucks also have a tendency to spontaneously snap in half

You have to sink into the plastic a bit, but if you are careful it wont cause any unpleasantly ugly damage. I used it on $30 abec flywheel clones so i wasnt too worried about damage anyway. It looks much better like this than with the retainer ring.
