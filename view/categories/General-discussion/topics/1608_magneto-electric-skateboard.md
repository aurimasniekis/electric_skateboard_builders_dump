Anybody hear of a UK company named Magneto making a e-board? They are reasonably priced about 650$ with US shipping and advertise 18mph and a 15mile max range. I picked one up just to try it. I had a Yuneec e-go that I loved but just grew out of. I bought the Marbel but returned it ASAP for a refund (first builds were junk, almost no QA/QC before being shipped).

Once again, form the top, 
you can build a board for $300-$600 mono-drive and you will have immense satisfaction because it was something you partially made/assembled yourself. 
The board its self with trucks/flywheels: $100-$200
Electonics: $120 vesc,
 $20 rx/tx
 $100 for lipo starter pack w/ charger
Mechanical mount(s): $120-$200

Build it yourself and you wont regret it

No I haven't. Nor will I. I'm pretty content buying them until I get the extra free time. Thanks for the snarky remark that has nothing to do with the topic. Much appreciated!

Dude. Realize that you're on electric-skateboard.**builders**. Guido wasn't really being snarky. He was just trying to offer you a different perspective on eBoards that happens to be the points of these forums.

I can understand that, no problem. 

However...

It's kinda fuzzy for me though, so please explain, how is purchasing a complete RTR (prebuilt, preprogrammed, complete with 1st batch problems, etc.) Raptor board any different than the others... Yet I see those as topics and discussions.

Hey skater, thanks for the heads up on Marbel boards. I was considering one of those at one time myself.
When my Ego just wasn't fast enough anymore.
 There are several companies trying to bring in wheel motors to the market and its good to get real feedback on them when ever possible. I am curious, did you notice heat build up in the motors? Some suspect that sealing the motors up inside the wheels would cause overheating.
The Magneto looks very similar to several brands that are available on Amazon. I would recommend searching Youtube for first hand reviews. I see that a quick google search brings up the Magneto website and they do sell spare parts so with support, its probably a safe bet for an intermediate e-board. 18mph feels a lot faster that 13 and should satisfy for a while. In time you'll probably outgrow that board also.
Cheers

Because the RTR is still a DIY board. You need to fix it yourself before you can use it ðŸ˜Ž.

I'd say buy from me as well but don't have anything to sell. You'll get the best fregin board in the world if u make it for 800$.  Easy.  U need duct tape and a soldering iron..and possibly not even need a solder iron if u buy ur parts with plugs matching.   Maybe u don't know but I'd bet almost everyone on this site who's made a board has more power than commercial stuff

Can someone answer the poor guys question folks, he asked about Magneto, if its good or is it some chinese fur ball they coughed up...

The specs look descent, based in London, but they could have just bulk buyed a shit load of boards to london now...

The magneto, falcon, backfire, and melon (not mellow) are the same Chinese imports. They will disappoint you. Guts attached for inspection.

Raptor is better quality, better specs, and if you ever need help, this forum has hundreds of people who are experts and willing to help. The only reason I didn't buy a raptor is because I couldn't afford it. If you have the cash though, they're the best way to go. By far.

Mine was second hand with issues to start with so maybe I'm not the best judge. My critism is build quality at that price point (new 600$ish). It's off the shelf parts, junky trucks. Thin plastic hull. I think it represents a the best argument for DIY vs store bought. $600 can go along way if you have some patience make your own. 

Also, if that's your price point, support our community and get a carvon mini board. The advertisers behind these boards make it sound like they hit lab bench and did some legit R and D to come up with the best components. They just batch ordered from China. 

I bet your thinking, "whatever man, as long as it skates it skates." And that's true too.

You can get it on alibaba for $400 if you ask for a sample.  Or on ebay for about $500.  I have one and it is true to its specs.  I have a friend with one who got it and it didn't start but if you contact them they will help and replace it (I think the warranty is 90 days).  I expect the first thing to go out is the esc which just means I can replace it with the latest v-esc (They are currently working on v5 I believe).  Finding replacement parts is super tricky I looked up all the companies that re-brand it and saved the parts links.  My hope is that it last long enough for hub motors to go down in price so I can swap it in since those have no drag.  The biggest issue with this board is the fact that the acceleration and breaking isn't fine tuned (which is fixed upon swapping the esc).  If your looking for the best this is not it but I'd still recommend it unless you feel you would want something better down the line then I saw build your own and go for hub motors if you can.  I may have shown slight bias on my reply on hub motors but honesty being able to use your board like a normal one without drag is super cool and acceleration from stop is improved.

100% of all the boards use at leaset some Chinese components. The difference with the magneto vs carvons is quality and quality control. The Magneto is a crappy clone board. Same as takeda/lecdec/falcon/luuov/backfire/melon/etc.

It may have some Chinese parts, but it's not a clone. Jerry attaches the motors himself, not some factory in china. If you saw it on albania, likely it was copied by a factory in china. The same thing has happened to mellow. But mellow is not a cheap Chinese clone.

I bet you could. Not to be a smart ass, but almost anything is possible. Depends on effort/time/money. 

My import board went to my brother in Texas with plans essentially do that next time I'm in town.  Esc is a known type, that plastic is fairly easily modded to throw in 2 6s lipos in parallel. When I get around to it, I'll post pics. 

That said, don't hold your breath for them. Also don't go buy a new board like this with hopes of modding it. 

Onloop/enertions comments about spend more and do it right the first time are right on.

...at some point you are probably going to swap to a Hub motor (and trucks), then a new battery, and all you end up with is the original Magneto $40-50 deck. That's why people have been telling you to just build your own.

From what I see on YouTube, these Chinese clones are not bad, just not great. It's like a economy car, gets you from point A to point B but not the greatest. As long as you are okay with it and know what you got yourself into, it's a fine starter.

When I placed my order for a Magneto skateboard four months ago I believed that I was buying a skateboard made in uk at a very good quality/price.
I did some researches on the net and all the reviews were excellent.
So I bought it end of June and believed to have it in august.

During this period I sent several messages (email, facebook) to the customer service to have info about specifics and shipping tracking. 
They never answered until I put a negative review on Magneto page on facebook... then all of a sudden someone answered me saying that it would be more than happy to offer me a refund...
Of course I wanted my board, I was just asking about shipping time and specifics...

Realised later that Magneto deleted my negative review (and probably a lot more...) as they maintain only the positives one... http://bit.ly/2cw7HLm

Have a look here (bottom page): they push the bad reviews at the very end in order to hide it ... http://bit.ly/2d04WVL

Then middle august I receive an email saying that the skate is blocked on a shipping boat from China... :O wtf

I did some intensive research then and...

http://bit.ly/2d3mSeh
http://bit.ly/2d07d3h
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzaG2yQmdns
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ki8rvXAYD9A

I discovered that you can buy the same skate for cheap on Alibaba, and If I probably did I wouldn't wait ages....

Well, next time I'll be more careful before buying a uk crafted skateboard... they might come from China!

Hi,

I have a "sister" board, a LecDec, not the one on the video you put but a new model with a different deck but all the rest is the same. I bought mine expecting to receive it a month later, that's what the web page said. It took more time, a lot more time, about 3 months after I bought it.

But besides the initial wrong delivery date, LecDec was very clear about the shiping and sent several information about it, even the tracking of the boat where it was being transported to Europe from China. When I talked to LecDec via the online chat they answered to my questions about the shiping.

The last part when the board was already in Europe was a lillte more complicated because I never got a tracking number by email, I had to request it via the online chat. They did gave it to me but it was not really easy to track in the Internet. It was sent by Royal Mail that has a partner here in Portugal to deliver the packages, I had to make a call to check where it was. After this no problem, I got the electric longboard and so far so good.

Before I bought it, I was very well informed about where the longboard was made and about all the clones that exists out there some Internet investigation. This was one of the reasons I choose this board, lots a spare parts out there if needed. LecDec never hide where the longboard was being made, after all all things come from China this days if we want them cheap.

Besides all this I'm happy with my LecDec. It rides very well, has more speed than I can handle and makes more than 15 km for each battery charge. Overall, on my opinion, it's not a bad electric longboard. I hope your longboard gives you some of the pleasure I have when riding mine. :slight_smile: 

Regards,
Luis Sismeiro

Got mine yesterday, so far pretty happy with it. It's quite solid for the price. All these boards are the same, Melon board, Lecdec, Backfire, Lectric.. But I think Magneto customized it a bit more. They've got custom wheels and trucks on them.

There can be a bunch of other factors that can throw you off, if you don't check the wires and setup, or do your homework. Make sure to check for shorts and your wires, and program the VESC correctly. Also, I highly recommend leather gloves.

Got a Magneto about a month ago, brakes were terrible. Like unusable because they were so harsh. Swapped in a vesc and everything was fine after that, smoother acceleration/braking. Motor runs quieter and it has a higher top speed now. Range is still about the same 12-14 miles on a charge. Just now swapped the bearings out for betters ones, so in all a vesc plus bearings and you have a nice board. 

I went this way on purpose, wanted to see exactly how these clones boards actually are. My next board will be a smaller lighter board. Probably built with nice parts myself as opposed to buying pre-built.

I bought a Magneto and the belt broke at thirsd day. I was waiting almost a month an a half untill they sent me a new one. This belt broke in six days. They sent me another one in a week that was broke too. Since then, three months ago, they don't send me anything more and don't offer me any solution. Since one month ago they just ignored me.

Since the day I received I am waiting for a new battery cover because mine is poorly constructed and is not good assembled. They said me that their factory are in Shangai and they are still waiting (five months).

Another things to tell about magneto:

Magneto can't climb 15%, I doubt even 10%. My weight are 70kg.
_ Magneto's range is less than 10 miles, not up to 15 miles as they promise.
_ You CAN'T use it in manual mode when the battery is finish.

Just measure it. Lay it down, squash it (in half) flat with a ruler, measure end to end (mm) and then double it.
It's almost definitely a 5mm pitch, so HTD 5M then your measurement in length. Probably HTD 5M 255mm or 249mm...
Measure the width of the belt too because it could be 9/10/12/15mm
