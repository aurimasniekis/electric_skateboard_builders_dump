Hey guys, I have a quick questions but if you live in the USA (in my case Florida).  How long does it generally take for an order to arrive from Trampa?  I'm going to try to time my delivery when I am back onshore (I work offshore in the Gulf of Mexico) and at home.

Iâ€˜m not in the US but you can choose different delivery options usually. you can find the expacted delivery time on the website when you start the check out. Where you need to write your Adresse etc.
