"His project, the Tag Heuer Board, is a prototype that befits commuters of all types, and we can only hope this electric skateboard get developed further."

Wikipedia:

"A prototype is an early sample, model, or release of a product built to test a concept or process or to act as a thing to be replicated or learned "

Obviously a prototype was not built. Poorly written article probably mostly for click bait.

Why all the negative comments? I think it looks bad-ass! If it had the Raptor's torque (and brakes) I'd totally buy it, if it were available and not just a concept.

@ALEXANDER This is  why the dis. If it were ever actually made very few would likely to get one as it would likely be a limited edition and cost an absolute bomb.

Check out the Revoll its being sold for $3000 eruo not including postage and taxes. So far nothing out yet from that company. Just shows you what an archievement Enertion and Evolve are doing with their products.  Albeit delays for delivery.  Both companies just cant make enough of them.

These concepts are good for the DIYs for ideas.  I want the wheels.

Just because it (hypothetically) caters to a niche market doesn't automatically mean it should be put down though. Take the Vertu cellphones as one similar example, sure I wouldn't personally own one for many reasons, but they have every right to exist and please the small market share they cater too.

On a side note, I'm with you 100% about Enertion, they're awesome - Seriously impressive operation! I currently have a Raptor Duel on order (#4808), thus my presence here most days checking on shipping updates and such.

Guess I just liked the aesthetics of the board up top, and I like the fact it can store the remote inside. Looks clean.

(edit: it would be cool if while the remote was stored inside it also charged while the board was plugged in)
