Hey I'm heading to Paris 8/30 - 9/9. My GF has a work trip we're turning into a little vaca, I'll be free mostly from 8/31 - 9/4. After that we'll prob do our own thing. 

Are there any Parisian's interested in letting me borrow/rent a board? I've heard there is a pretty big group out there, would love to see the city on an eboard! 

Thanks.

Put a shout out here if you can. All the French guys were super cool at the Paris event. Different kinda crazy out of the box thinking on a lot of their stuff too.
