The usual Hub motor conversation:

> @pixelsilva 
> How about the thane thickness? Sick of all hub motors with thin sleeves. Now that you will enjoy some form of cooling with that air flow over the motor why not installing thick PU ?

> @sk8l8r 
> agreedâ€¦ sounded cool until the same old thin thane

> @pixelsilva 
> Yeah, why? â€¦well I know why (@Hummie told me). Is all heat exchange. Motor temperature rises, but if is covered by thick Uro layer, heat will not disipate properly. Thats why Sleeves are so thin. But is time for a changes. We want hub motors covered by thick PU.

Now, could someone pleaseeee produce a decent hub motor with thick thane? We Esk8ers demand big thaned hub motors. Enough of that super thin covers.

Belt, gear or direct drive. It's a flawed concept.

Maybe someone can develop a thermal PU something that can transfer heat

You could be right. Looks like a dead end.

I agree with flawed concept. I have yet to try a hub motor that satisfies me and I used to own a Raptor 2

Yes I road the Carvon Evo prototype in January, granted it was a prototype not a finished product but it has maybe half the torque of the Raptor 2 but more top speed. I didn't like it. Also that's a direct drive I think there is a future for direct drive but not hubs lol

tbh, I wanna see some 6"- 8" pneumatic speed based hubs w/ a 13" hanger and 10mm-12mm axle

You can start with Trampa's new 12-Fifties hanger with 9.525mm axles (minus that annoying hump)...

Yeah I haven't tried to 2 wheel drive config maybe that's a little bit slower

sorry i wont support any trampa products, nor should any other designer unless they plan to sell their product and all its rights to them for less than what its worth lol... or the alternative of getting cut off from buying their parts

Sdr4wd. I wanted the xl, alas I was too slow
Still fast as shit, I understand the low end torque is ok on tiller wheels. His maytech 4wd is just fkn disguisting though. Any speed

Carvon recommends 4wd for anyone over 250lbs anyway lol 

Yours must ride really nice

Do you think I can get more speed if I put the system on 13s

Yeah of course you will but for me that's pushing the ESC to close to the limits. Some guys still risk it but I won't unless I have another esc that can handle it.

I'm going to 40amp today on battery c how that helps. I think part of my issue is the 4p also.

Well free rides today at the renegade race with the hummie hubs 4wd!!

Thereâ€™s only 2mm in the radius more in the core (ie the hub motor) than the core of an abec fly wheel. That coupled with good thick wheels poured by a and e.they feel great, even on shitty road.

Wish I could make it Hummies are the only Hubs I have not tried.  They do look nice.

4p on awd might be your limiting factor. What motor amps you running? I'm gonna run 80motor and 40 battery amps on my awd set up.

35batt/45motor now just reached the vape shop. Feels fast but again the elevation change on my route my be inhibiting my low end torque

Probably switching to 40amp battery but I can't get my hm10 to work ðŸ˜“

[/quote]

Not sure I agree with the whole flawed concept thing.  They work well as a low amp set up.  Don't get hot and you can cruise around all be it slowly all day long.  Where it becomes problematic is when you try to get them to perform like a satellite/gear set up.  Then they get hot.  Use them the way the chinese do with limited current and they do just fine.  Boring but fine.  Each to their own really.  Even the direct drives leave me wanting in the torque department but then I like to be ripped off the line and not gently encouraged up the road.  Oh and I'm a big heavy lump too.
