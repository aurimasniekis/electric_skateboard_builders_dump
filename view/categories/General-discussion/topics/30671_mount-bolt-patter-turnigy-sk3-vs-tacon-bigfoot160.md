Does anyone know if the bolt pattern is the same for the two motors?

I have a Tacon Bigfoot 160 and I need a mount. Easy to find mounts that I know work with the SK3 motors but I can't find dimensions online of the Tacon motors to compare. 

Anyone know?

yes the outer holes are the same. the tacon also has 30mm hole pattern like a 50mm motor.
