Hi! I was wondering what is the best CF Deck and enclosure that people use on here?

Hi5ber is a CF deck manufacturer. And @Sender will wrap anything in CF that you can get your hands on.

Not many CF enclosures here. Best ones I've seen are Mastercho but AFAIK He doesn't make them anymore.

As for the decks a few are carbon wrapped and not exactly completely made of CF but Hi5ber makes good ones.

Just get the @sender job and you won't be able to know the difference :smile:

Can't you stick the receiver antenna through the deck and have it under the griptape?

Raptor 1 is full CF. @NAF Hyperbeast is full CF. Lacroix Enclosure is CF
But @solideogloria is the best

On a serious note. From my limited experience of full Carbon fibre everything (raptor 1) it sucks the big one. 
Clattery and stiff.

Did you ever find one? I like the evolve ones, have both a carbongt gen2 and 3. I got a beat up old one (long one with 1 wheel drive) off eBay for under 200 shipped. It’s really easy to make a basswood spacer to give you more battery room. 

It isn’t insanely stiff, there is a cut out under the kick tail for the receiver that avoided the radio blocking properties of CF.

No not really. It was going to be for some consumer board that me and a friend were going to make but he backed out and so I gave up on looking for a CF deck as I’m just going to make a personal build now(mountainboard)
