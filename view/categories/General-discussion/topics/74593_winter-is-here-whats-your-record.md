Yes,  Winter has hit the Northern half of the US and it is again time to bear the brunt of mother nature.  Today was out on board at **6 F / -14.4 C.**  Damn it is cold only lasted a couple of miles was pretty well protected and thankful I had my wheels with bike tire studs installed in 9" pneumatic tyres.

What is the your record low temperature ride? (For the guys in SoCal 50F is not cold)

I like to tie a rope to my golf cart in the winter and pull through the snow on a board (with no electronics). I'm gonna say around 15 degrees. It's nice to hit some Tokyo drifts when there's only an inch or 2 on the road.

I have ridden many a winter day as well as night and will tell you the only way to have confidence is to install studs into your tires.  I have a video on the a tread that explains the process in detail.  The problem with screws, tie wraps and etc.  I have found is they are a terrible to ride and really do not last.  The MTB studs I have are small with a tungsten core that is better, safer as well as the ride is not comprised...yes you can hear the clicking of the studs but that is what you want when taking a corner at speed over ice and crud.  If you really want to ride in the winter it is the only way to go....

@mmaner If you would like to give these a try I could send you a bag of 90 or so...I really did not like as well as the MTB stud as they stick out of the tire as they are screwed into the tread.  They would probably be great for the snow machine as you would get some serious grip..They also have the tungsten core, just lose a bit of ride quality and I found them much harder to install vs. the MTB stud. I would think a great addition to tubeless tires.

@mmaner here is the stud in a six shooter it sticks out a little but I do not think it will come out...at this depth it has not penetrated inner wall.


![image|375x500](upload://eHiletahY65Fnqyrk5QPaKptcGY.jpeg)

if you bottom out the stud it will penitrate the inner wall

![image|375x500](upload://2uPsZVSLrPR5Kl3dVNXJZtlOdRg.jpeg) 

You will need to at a anti puncture strip or tape or 3d printed sleeve to protect the tube

What‚Äôs your thoughts?

I could install MTB studs as they require only 4mm wall and the six shooter is about 6mm by the way the durameter of the rubber on the six shooter is real stiff had to heat up a little with hot air gun before insertion of the screw stud.

@mmaner ... Mike PM me an address and I will send you a kit of parts appox. 90 studs and an insertion bit.  These will provide some real grip...just figure out insertion depth and if you go flush...tube protection layer maybe a sleeve of plastic I am sure you can design on you 3d printer.  All we ask is to provide a thread of your work and experience...also as stated above heating the six shooter rubber helps quite a bit with insertion.

oh yeah, can't believe an entire city burnt down, city called Paradise of all things, way too many people died.

Supposedly fire was started because of malfunctioning PG&E/SoCal Edison power lines...*sigh* more fuel for the  fake global warming news.

This is my riding season, I hate riding when it's "nice out" in California, too damn hot.

More like too damn smokey, I'm stuck inside all day because I can't even see the (normally) clearly visible mountains right by my house.
