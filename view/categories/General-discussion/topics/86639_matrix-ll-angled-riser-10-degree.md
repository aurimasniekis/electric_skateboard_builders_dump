Hi everyone , fews month ago l think l already ask this question but never find my answer. But Anyway l have a basic mbs mtb with ats 12 trucks and 20 degree tip angle but l want to upgrade with matrix ll metal version. So can use a angled riser of 10 degree ? Also is it the same bolt patern ? Thank you

Hi Celica, you can do that with risers. There are also designs on thingiverse to use or you could buy then from nowind

Same bolt pattern yes

What you wanna do?

* minus ‚Äú-‚Äù will reduce tip angle

* plus ‚Äú+" will increase tip angle

More Angle more steering but also less stable
