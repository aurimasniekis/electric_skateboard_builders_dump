So I was riding and I went around a corner when I heard a loud crack from my board. It ended up being the spring retainer on my trampa trucks shearing allowing the spring to freely move around. My board is now out of commission until I get a reply from @trampa who I emailed this afternoon. My board has less than 100 miles on it. ![image|375x500](upload://4vtYjQ3sGS0wsoJb5XnAk7cQ49f.jpeg) ![image|375x500](upload://jszDsLfAA8WBkFk6AUwVd0RRdJT.jpeg)

Hi @Trdolan03, it is very rare to see a retainer splitt in half. Riding without dampas and without pre-tension on the springs puts a lot of strain on the retainers. Best practice is riding with enough pre-tension, so that the decompressed spring will always see some load. We will send you a new retainer.

I won't switch back to springs, the elastomere dampers are still stable at speed and have better turning radius. With extreme leaning and bindings the turning radius is ridiculous tight.

for reference guys... u can get MTB trucks from MBS (matrix 2) that use shock blocks not springs from the get go for ~80 USD and for a 4 pack of shock blocks u pay 25 USD vs ~87USD for infinity trucks + 75USD for elastomer blocks.

they even have 3 different varieties ranging from soft to hard (yellow red and orange)

With or without bindings?

@Holyman92 you are right but the thing is that one has drivetrains for Trampa or MBS. I would be interested to test Matrix II trucks, too (beside the fact that the plastic baseplate scares me) but my drivetrain is made for Trampa and doesn't fit on MBS hangers. My gear/hub adapter is for Superstar hubs so I can't use MBS hubs neither. All this stuff is expensive so changing the trucks would mean to change much more if you already have everything. So buying this dampers only is cheaper and quick to swap on a running Trampa system.

You compare apples to oranges.
Trampa Trucks are all metal, cold forged front to back and take springs with or without dampas or elastomer springs. Our Korean fellows have even fitted hydraulic steering dampas. 
When you ride off road, you will realize that the trucks see a lot of strain and any weakness in them will cause them to fail sooner than later.
The Trampa spring truck is known to be pretty much bullet proof. The only spare part you will need over time are some new bushing sleeves once in a while. Some of our team riders ride on 5 year old trucks. Same baseplate, same hanger, same springs. When things last for years it doesn't matter if you spent a bit more in the beginning.

With bindings the difference is like day and night. The elastomere dampers feel like springs with yellow dampas (stability wise) but you can do much tighter turns. There is a point where you can't compress a spring further, this also exists on the dampers but with more lean you can compress them further, more than springs. Hard to explain.

I can't ride faster than 50km/h (self protection :laughing:) but I don't use any pre-tension on the dampers and they are stable so I guess by adding some pre-tension you can go faster without getting troubles.

But when I say stable it's maybe not the same stable what you have in your mind. I compare the elastomere dampers (without pre-tension) to springs with fresh yellow dampas according stability but they have much better turning radius (with bindings). Also after 1000km the yellow dampas got softer and I got speed wobbles above 40km/h.

With springs I had to jump around to make tighter turns, now i just make the turn.

The retainers of E-Toxx have 2 different sized threads that's why it's possible to mount the top ones with M8 grub screws (glued with Loctite) like the original springs including the possibility to add pre-tension. Trampa's barrel retainers are mounted with M5 bolts through the M8 thread of the baseplate and are not adjustable .

For last two weeks now I am living with red dampas and I have pretty good combination of turn-ability and stability :) Green ones were not stable enough and felt like I am riding always on high tension to keep it stable :)

With red ones I can even carve without any issues of course with straps but no heal ones :)

[quote="Kug3lis, post:54, topic:72267"]

It seems you talk about high speed carving

My problem was always the turning radius at low speed which is huuuuuuge like zero with springs and yellow dampas. I tried springs only but it felt loose, spongy and very unstable. The dampers give me stability plus wicked turning radius if needed. But of course for high speed above 50km/h you don't need this turning radius.

If hard press I can stop probably in like 5-10meters... Board would stop but not me :) running -100A

@rich not high speed I can make pretty decent turn radius but only problem is 180¬∞ on small radius...

Yellow for me is like without dampas at all green ones allowed me to make circle of like 2-3meter... Stable up to 50km but more u have to tension up :)

I could do same on green ones maybe bit wider :slight_smile: Also I switched to red ones because I thought green ones with 4 kg more would be even more turnable

Also I think it depends on weight of rider, board and how you turn :) Sometimes I even grip deck with toes for aggressive turning :) I had even reached point there sometimes I almost tipping over scary feeling :face_vomiting:

And another issue not really related is cold weather riding... Tires when cold doesn't stick to road if it's too flat... I have felt board sliding on higher speeds...

For sure, as reference I'm 74kg but I would say the turning radius with dampers is better than with springs only. And this can happen on hard leans when using springs without pre-tension

Hi @malJohann, you can use the regular adjuster screw to ad more pre-tension. Our team riders came to the conclusion that it makes no sense to do so. You don't get the same effect as on a spring-dampa system.
The elastomer spring is higher than the available space and gets optimal pre-tension with the retainer in top most position. As with all elastomers, you need a different shore rating to get a stiffer setup. Overtightening elastomers is not good for them. It damages the material.
This is why skate bushings usually come in a variety of harnesses. 

Also note that assembly with glued in M8 bolt is quite tricky. You can't slide in the barrels from the side easily when the retainer is mounted already.

Even if you ride with some preload, the spring retainers can break.  I can attest to that.  I've had my board running since Monday and have gotten about an hour or riding in and already busted one retainer.  Pretty bummed about the situation right now.

Already contacted Trampa to hope for a replacement.  Let's hope for the best.  I'm strongly considering switching to some E-Toxx elastometers to avoid a repeat situation.

Update:  Trampa is sending out a few replacement retainers today.  Props to them!

In the meantime, I 3D printed a solid PETG replacement retainer as a temporary measure.  I beefed up the flange the springs sits on since I'm not sure how strong a printed part is.  I tested it on a grass field, asphalt, and snow over the weekend and I didn't die.

Only downside so far is that due to the increased thickness of the flange, the minimum spring preload is a bit higher.  If anyone is interested, let me know and I can upload the .stl to thingiverse once I get home.
