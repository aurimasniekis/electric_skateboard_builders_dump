So I've been backordered for almost two months with @onloop and really need to cancel my vesc order with him. I'm very tight on cash and need a working board asap to get to and from work, since Im working 12 hours a day and don't have time to wait for the bus, don't have money for a car, and can't afford having a third bike get stolen this year. Jason wants to charge a 20% restocking fee on an item he doesn't even have in stock! Thats pathetic! Is $20 really worth it, Jason? Why is it necessary? Why is Enertions customer service so consistently horrible? This is the second time I've had an issue, the first being my drive wheel pulley arriving with some scratched and slightly frayed teeth, ALSO the misleading "trucks may need modification" when ALL trucks on the market except for yours REQUIRE modification to use your pulley. I sent in pictures of the questionable condition of the pulley and STILL wasn't offered an actual refund. Now I'm trying to cancel the vesc to buy from another supplier whose guaranteeing me a 2-week delivery, and I have to pay a $20 restocking fee for an item that is not even in stock. How do you justify buying from enertion? There's nothing they supply that you can't get elsewhere for similar or better quality without the scummy customer service.

I removed some of the condecending remarks. Please don't censor this post, I think it is important for people to have a honest look Enertions customer service. Enertion is hyped up so much on Jason's forum here, I'm sharing my terrible experience with his company the same way people would over Walmart or Target products.

I am glad that you did that and that is why I haven't closed the thread. I have also tagged onloop so he can fix your concerns. You're right, it isn't spamming but you should've PMd me before you made another post. Your other one wasn't approporiate and that isn't the way we treat people on this forum.

Your vesc order has been refunded 100% 

Is this the same Mike holland that complained his pulley was dusty/dirty & complained because you didn't see our notes & videos & forum topics discussing the need to modify the trucks?  

We gave you 100% credit on that purchase too, Also you still have the pulley.

Yes it is! Thank you for the full refund, I really hope the best for your business, Jason! You have to understand how insanely misleading and deceiving your description of "trucks may need modification" is, when you could instead have put "non-extended enertion trucks will require modification". Thanks again

The problem is Mike that some people expect everything delivered on a silver platter.... People forget this is a forum about building electric skateboards... DIY.... Enertion sells parts so people can make their own electric skateboards.... sometimes folks need to pick up the tools and get dirty.... my products will never be completely universal for all situations.

It seems lately the DIY spirit is being lost & people find it easier to cry

If you want me to build you and electric skateboard buy a raptor.

I don't understand this Jason, you know nothing about me, nor do I know anything about you. To make this kind of condescending judgement is shallow, shortsighted, and completely lacking any foundation. Whether you meant to do it or not, you mislead a customer (and probably more to come as the community grows and more newbies start buying parts from the cool brands) and instead of owning up and admitting that you could've been explicitly clear and in 5 words could've accomplished what all of the associated vidoes and forums communicated regarding your product. The fact that you're choosing to not be explicit and deflecting any fault makes me way more inclined to believe that you're willing to practice in ill-intent for the sake of greed and money. 

I don't expect anything on a silver platter, I just don't expect people to be so shallow and short-sighted, especially when running a business in a young and budding industry. 2 years ago I was living in the ghetto in Tampa with my best friend, biking 17 miles one way to work, working construciton for 10 hours a day, 11 days in a row (3 days off) for 8 months for $8/hr to start paving the path to get to where I'm going today. I still have some major obstacles to overcome, hence working two totally not glamorous jobs in high-end retail to help pay my own way through college and maybe own a place of my own. 

whats your story jason? where does all of this shadiness and attitude stem from?

I get the feeling that most problems people complain about could have easily been avoided by them doing actual research or posting a question here before buying.

However what I don't like is that he now gets a different treatment (100% refund, no restocking fee) just because he complained on this forum. That seems unfair to people that stay quiet and believe what support staff is telling them to be final. It actually encourages this type of posts, that only serve the purpose of generating a public outcry for the sake of getting what they wanted.

I don't see the shady business practice you are talking about.
"trucks may need modification" is a correct description - it is your job to make sure whether you have one of the trucks that need modification or not. There have been videos online of people showing how they do it with a Dremel.
Some slight scratches on a plastic pulley should also not be too much of a problem - you are using it to drive a belt that will be constantly rubbing on it anyway so after one ride you would probably not be able to tell a difference to one that was smooth in the beginning. As long as it was in a working condition this should not be a problem.
Restocking fees are also a widely used business practice for small companies so I don't see it there either.

it's totally misleading. Trucks will require modification in 99.99% of situations. why couldn't he just say something along the lines of "non-custom enertion trucks will require minor modification". He's trying to run a serious business, shouldn't he not be relying on youtube videos or a completely separate forum to explain what he could explain in ONE sentence on the product page and eliminate any chance of a bad experience?

You should see if they're hiring customer service reps, much better than "it's gonna get dirty anyways..."

The reason the restocking fee pissed me off was because the product is not even in stock. It's not like he had to open a returned package, inspect it for damages or flaws, log it into inventory control...I gladly paid hobbykings restocking fee because I decided to upgrade batteries after opening mine and realizing I should've spent more on higher quality packs. 100% my fault, no problems.

No, it isnt.
He could write something else, yes.
But i can tell from experience there are always people who are not able to use their brain.
I bet if he wrote it like that and you had found another already modified truck for cheaper than his, you would have been one of the first screaming that jason tries to force you to buy his truck.

The 20% restocking fee is written in our T&C's to protect us against loss, it may be enforced for some preorder / built-to-order products that we are in the process of assembling &/or have ordered parts for, etc Like raptors, as we take heaps of parts off the shelf to build people these products... those parts can't really be sold separately afterwards.

At the moment I am training new staff to help me with the inbound tickets, sometimes they get things wrong or apply our rules in a way that is not in our or customers best interest... in this case i fixed the problem by doing the refund for him...

I was under the impression that he was in fact treated differently just because of his post - that I would have not liked.

normally when people carry on like complete dicks on the public forum specifically trying to shame me & my business my first instinct is to actually treat them less favourably! why reward them?

In the end, my judgement gets the better of me and i end up treating them as i would treat any respectable member of the community who is reasonable and deals with me without screaming.

I need to rant

@itsmikeholland 

I think you saw my post on the 55in longboard...in that picture are purple trucks with @onloop's pulley. 

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/c/cab80083a9a5ffce6ac4797f35c6272c4e8ef40b.jpeg" width="500" height="500"> 

👆🏻
Took me less than 5 minutes...Measured the width of a bearing, marked it with a sharpie...and just dremeled it off...took a pair of pliers and took off the nub....

First time ever installing that pulley....it nothing to get freaked out about...

 "Truck modification might be required"  ... Did you do any research into this after you saw this? Or did you just ignore it and order it anyway and cross your fingers it will fit?

I'm curious ... I took at your pulley thread ...you complain abt the condition of it...why didn't you post photos of it for us to see? Or did I miss it? I mean...it was the center of the issue...you make it seem un-useable..is it in-useable?

And the VESC issue...I can see your point about not having it and being charged and re-stocking fee...that isn't good....and the other issue, about how long the back orders are...that sucks as well....But....VESCs are in short supply...you ain't the only one on that boat....and if anything those issues are almost common knowledge in this circle....

Unfortunately, waiting is part of this particular DIY experience....At times we are dealing with smaller companies...maybe even home based businesses...Even big businesses make us wait...Ill give you an example:
Hobby King ... Go buy a 63mm motor that's above 149kv...You can't ....

I think you're upset that you aren't getting your stuff now👇🏻
Like it should been here yesterday and because you don't want to take the bus anymore...all valid reasons for wanting an electric skateboard...but it takes time sometimes...no one tells you that when you start doing this that you have to wait sometimes...It's funny....I got asked this yesterday 👇🏻
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/0/05cf26ada368ac585ecfcf5bad0b1e57f1398ff9.jpeg" width="602" height="500">

It's the nature of the beast...
 
Another sort of rant....

Everyone seem to be pissing and moaning abt his customer service....All these noobs think @onloop freaking Amazon or some shit....PEOPLE! Heads up! his office is essentially his garage...(Go watch his Vlogs) He's a SMALL business owner...in Australia......Dealing with OUR known universe....that's a lot of noobs and shitty people to deal with (let's be frank)... Oh soooo easy for the "armchair business owners" out there (you know who you are) saying ..."just hire more people"..."oh...that's so rude and unprofessional"....my fave are the ones that say, "I've built many companies..and IMO..blah blah blah" .... How abt we give this dude a little fooking slack...I think places like Amazon and the Internet in general have SPOILED every single one of us.l....We are applying the same standards to Enertion that we would with a much bigger company ...you can't ...and if he wants to bend his rules to disconnect with a customer by providing a refund outside policy....so be it....and to those that feel cheated, and to think that's UnFAIR....I say to you tough shit...his house, his rules ... He sorted it out...everyone walked away whole.....

 This is a world of "INSTANT GRATIFICATION" and you know it...go look at all your posts @itsmikeholland... I can actually see the urgency that you have...in time and money $...Dude...again ... You are not the only one....You haven't been singled out to have an aweful experience...your lack of patience and money have made it sour...

lol I've become that guy...sorry for the rant.... Just getting tired of watching all these "squeaky wheels" rolling around here lately Sorry dude it's what I see

Dude I just checked his website and on the pulley page there is even a youtube video explaining what needs to be done to a caliber truck :expressionless:. The website actually hands it to you on a silver platter...<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/2/2d93adc6c5b410cdd8eace1f5105b90a0605d2dc.PNG" width="472" height="500">

Hi,

I think having these type of experiences - which are part of the full story of the DIY builds - shared 
1, shows to new users what should be on the checklist for new builds to avoid headache 
2, helps to make it easier to compare different options like parts and services and
3, supports in situations when things already went wrong.

There are things on both sides that could be done in different ways but then we wouldn't be able to learn from it.

R, J.

Part of the problem is expectation....

Again, ordering these kinds of things can and do take time...Research needs to be done..so you know what parts you need and how to make them work for your application...if you are unsure...ask...it's so simple to get things clarified...when you ask the right questions...there are so many resources in this fourm, it's so concentrated...there is one main focus here...How to build an electric skateboard.

Agggghhhhhhh! (primal scream)

@Michaelinvegas Ive been on the forum since getting my Mk 1 Raptor.  All these disgruntled customers need to direct it to Enertion.  Not here.  Im over it like @Michaelinvegas .  Do your research and read the dam details before hitting the buy button.  Dont blame the seller for something that is clearly wriiten in the conditions. If you don't understand what they are simply ask the questions.

@itsmikeholland Mike you need to take some responsibility of your actions. Did you then take the advice from onloop and forum members for the 'mod'. Still complaining after a month. 
For everyones sake go to other suppliers and complain to them about your dramas,  Im sure Enertion dont need customers like you.  Good luck.

Enertion have been transparent in their operations.  If you know their situation why say the things you have pointed out. You should have pulled the pin on the Vescs weeks ago if you could get alternatives quicker.  Not. Using cash flow is a diversion and no excuse.

The internet is easy to find the information you need to build something. Gee my son built his own gaming computer all through google,  YouTube,  and his own now how.  Didnt see or hear him blame others for this or that.  I sometimes wonder why Jason is putting himself out there for this abuse. Its unwarranted sometimes,  and most of the time he will try and work It out.

I agree with you...and that goes for all the other small businesses here that have all supported this DIY community...Why do they all stick their necks out?..🤔

Maybe....Because all of them give a shit abt e-boarding...they like it so much ...they decided to make a business out of it...and they didn't stop there...they share knowledge and expertise...they share thier failures...they share the passion ... They are knee deep

We all need to realize that these guys are bustin their asses to get in our hands things that we need and want...these aren't Kickstarter or indigogo companies...these are "roll up your sleeves and get it done yourself" companies .... They are the engineers, help desk, and the parts guy all rolled into one, I'm sure they've written a few mailing labels themselves ......

And with all that, we all need to show a bit of respect to these pioneers...The DIYers that have graduated into business owners.  There so very few of them. (I don't think most people understand or even care).

My experiences with every other builder/supplier in not just the board project put also for my FPV drone and my diy computer, has been flawless and awesome, ESPECIALLY dexter at TB and now chaka; ive only had problems with enertion, and even though ive only had 2 orders with them, 100% of the time i felt like jasons team didnt actually care about providing the same excellent customer service that every single other builder provides. Dexter sent me a different motor mount that the one i asked for without telling me, and when i asked what happened, after admitting some fault, he explained that the newest version is better but still offered to send me the one i ordered for free. Jason admitted that the restocking fee wasnt appropriate, which is totally cool. I still think that while he can be more clear about his pulley requiring modification, he should be. Why only be 60% excellent when you can be 100% excellent. I dont own a dremmel or anything besides screwdrivers, wire cutters, and a soldering iron. Im not about to sacrifice the structural integrity of my axle for the sake of using his product. I wanted to send everything back, store credit was offered instead with is cool because whatever, i can stock up on belts or bearings with it. 

Im not sure where all of this roll up your sleeves and get dirty talk is coming from...i came to an enertion forum to complain about how the only builder to not have 100% excellent service is enertion. Am i happy i got refunded? Totally. Do i think calling the team out on a BS restocking policy was appropriate? Totally. Will i buy from them again? Probably not. Enertion is more likely than not gonna end up being the Tesla of the diy community. They need to act like it

To add on to this, i ordered a paris motor mount from torqueboards, it was in the cart already paid for. After learnjng that the caliber trucks were more stable and "better", i contacted dexter and he was cool about just swapping it out. No fee sor anything because it was totally unnecessary

Everyone is so fixated on me not wanting to dremmel my trucks, that wasnt the first issue. First issue was that it looked like someone just pulled off of their daily driver and mailed it to me, the teeth looked like they had some wear and tear, plus it had dirt caked into the teeth. I could still use the pulley by drilling screws through it, but that doesnt negate that it arrived in questionable condition and i couldnt be refunded for just the shotty dwp, the belt and motor pulley were excellent and are ready for use. Having to modify my trucks or the pulley to use a shotty dwp because jason didnt want to refund me for a subpar product is not excellent service.

Enertion isn't the only injection molded pulley in town, so they're not the only ones running chopped or extended axle trucks. Evolve, for example.... well i did a youtube video on using theirs that's already in this thread. 

Always expect to modify things when you enter the world of DIY hackery in which we dwell. Don't know what's up with receiving grody old pulleys though, that's cause for concern in my opinion too.

Long haired boy! I was pretty positive that i would need to dremmel either the truck, drill the wheel, or find a way to use a more narrow nut with some locktite or something, which wouldnt have been an issue if there was a good reason given as to why it looked like someone else brushed off an old one and sent it to me for full price. Id be totally cool if there was an explanation like say, "we test one from every batch to ensure quality control, yours was tested for X miles up to X mph" or something, but i was told that its gonna get dirty anyways, which is kinda shady. This was also before i knew thatJason has some kind of employees helping him out, which explains both problems. Judging by his extensive knowledge and his branding, i expected some top tier communication. The bulk of the frustration comes from needing to modify my trucks for a shady product that wasnt up to the standards i expected from the owner, and the responses i received were not convincing me that he really cared to figure out what i was so upset about. I asked to fully refund JUST the dwp, not the belt or motor pulley, since i was weary about the quality and it cost me a fortune to ship it to CA from australia. Hopefully new builders and suppliers and can learn something valuable from this exchange, regardless of how embarrassing it may be. 

Ive already ordered another pulley from someones else, and he provided store credit for the full order, which was cool.
