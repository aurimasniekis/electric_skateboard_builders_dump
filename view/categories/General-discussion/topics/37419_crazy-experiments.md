I would like to make a thread dedicated to crazy ideas and experiences that people have tried doing crazy stuff.My first crazy idea is has anyone tried doing a hub motor with a kv motor so it's a hub motor that has a drive wheel built in, would there be any power increase or decrease, I assume you would have to get a teeth to match the kv , would it just be more torque ?

You idea and how you explained it doesnt make logical sense. You may be talking about planetary geared hub motors or direct drive motors, but that has already been done.

I think he means a belt setup on a hub motor driven wheel - basically two motors for one wheel. Add a pulley to a hub motor and you should be able to easily realize this. Not sure about the benefits though.

A little crazy but interesting. Hard to say about the advantages. Could be easily accomplished with two rear belt driven motors and two front hub motors or vice versa. Carvon had something similar in mind, but never really went with it.

Crazy idea here. 
I see some having problem with battery/enclosure clearances from their boards, or battery capacity/ranges. 
Also, I'm sure some wants a clean setup.
My idea is to have a battery backpack. Thinking like, for example, 10s10p.
To connect the battery backpack to the board, I was thinking like a coiled cord with magnetic connector (Rosenberger) but can't find that can handle at least 100a. So will settle with xt90 for now.
I guess this is very practical if you want range.

```
the issue i see with this is that you have to shoulder the load of a huge weight for a long time. 100 cells adds up quick! Then you have a cable you might trip over, and that can potentially get tangled in your legs.  Additionally the board would be very light while the rider is very heavy so there might be a tendency for the board to accelerate out from under you, unless your stance is really strong.  if you do fall off the board, now you can't brake it because it's no longer powered, or its dragging you along with it. you'll also have like 100 volatile batteries strapped to your back which will hurt like a bitch if you land on them, assuming they don't catch fire

Yup, that's true.  That's why coiled cord with magnetic connector make sense.  Will just retract or spring back up when it's disconnected.
Yes, possibly dangerous for inexperienced rider.
Yes, you won't able to stop the board once you fall, just like a regular non-powered board.
Yeah it's a crazy idea, needs more research.  But eventually, innovative parts will pop-up.

Im doing something along these lines as well. Im putting an old 10S3P pack in my back pack then running a coiled wired to a 36W helmet mounted headlamp. I think it will work for my mountain board much better than a board mounted lamp that sucks power of my main battery. Only issue I see is that I could blind oncoming cars but thats not much off a concern since primary use would be off road.

I got a crazy idea... but I’ve actually explained it a few times on this forum already. Build a trailer for your esk8. Enough space for a tent, food, and leave half for a giant ass battery. I’m thinking like 10s 60000mah kind of battery. Then have a solar charger and connect the system with lead acids as backup for charging.. Connect to board. Go for miles and miles and miles and then camp for a while. I already built the trailer and designed the connector. Just got to get a metal version made and buy a bunch of those cheap eBay batteries. Could cost as little as 1000$ for a decent setup. Still some serious planning to do though... I’m working on it

Mine would be use a super fast 4wd build as a follow cam for downnhill raw runs.

Actually in the planning stage of the build, left is to figure out battery cell types and config. 
Basically 12s7p 30q (so far the best imao, checking 30t and a123 still) 4d hummie 145kv 97mm. 
Then Going on a riding trip for 2 weeks in spring in our skate van. Find some sick spots around europe, and get the sickest footage. IF you dont need a car for a follow cam for raw runs, it opens up so many more possibilities.

Few examples of some of my favourites raw runs:

[Beaitfully made, controled and representing switzerland as the riders paradise that it is.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZDHRKmGt44)

[Sick controle,fast for an open road (118km/h) SWITZERLAND BABY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bAeyKll-_U)

Curious if any of these magnetic gearing systems have made it into the real world.  There are likely limitations due to eddy currents and heat, but not an engineer or physicist to debunk the technology.  Would be great for hub motors and increased torque.

There's slip potential and think the magnets would have to be pretty big and strong to stop it. Expensie and Maybe lot of space. Wish its not the case but that's my guess

I like this idea. Mostly you are just using the board for break control/resistance at speed. I am going to try a similar idea with 4 v4 xl's.

You do not need a big battery if you are mostly using it for downhill video runs. You just want the 4wd for the smooth even breaking at speed.

EDIT: Plus i think 4 full urethane wheels will handle the speed better than the hub urethane on hummie's.

Well yeah, i if i uave a 2k build that only works downhill as a follow cam that would suck haha.
Still want it a a group ride alternative.

Trued some folowcams ona normal board, basically if you record a run you go balls to the wall. So I am at my limit as well. Holding a gimbal is impossible and if i mount it on my head it gets choppy and ruined in turns and slides/speed checks...

Well honestly at higher speeds wind is your best friend for slowing down. Like 60 to 40 is done real quick when you release your tuck and air brake. Added with roll resistance that about all I need. Normally you dont really brake on a nice run. Speedcheck and predrifts sure but I feel like with the above mentioned I shouod ve findle with the occasional footbrake mayby. 

Also wouod be scared to bust a slide at 40+ no idea what would uappen to hubs. Also i reckon a flatspot would suck major ass ;)
