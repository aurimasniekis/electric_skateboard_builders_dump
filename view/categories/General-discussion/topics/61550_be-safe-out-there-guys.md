I thank God I decided to go full gear today (full face helm, slide jacket, backpack, knee guards and loaded slide gloves) . Omw to work 2 miles away from my destination, disaster struck... I am thankful that my motor and electronics are fine, but my board is toast :(.... had to step off my board @ ~25mph and danger roll because the rear of my board snapped all the way across... motor suffered exterior damage but still functions, no deep dents (hopefully no broken mags)
