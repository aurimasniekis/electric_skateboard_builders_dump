Hey, guys so I have a quote for **Maytech unsealed 6355 140kv motors**. 

So here is the price. $77 per motor from the factory, and $88 shipped to me. So in the US I'm anticipating the price will be around **$100 shipped**.  

Phase wires are 240mm length and sensor wires are 500mm in length.  

**We need 20 people to make this happen please vote below only if you want to buy these.**

* interested in 1 motor
* interested in 2 motors
* interested in more than 2

Ooh, this sounds like a perfect motor for small, lightweight, don't need to go faster than light builds! Excited to see what people make from these :slight_smile:

Bumping this for the last time. Looks like there is some interest but not enough.

If we get less than 20 motors, price will be $110 shipped in the US. Are you guys still interested? Lmk what you guys think.

I'm still down to get these at that price but I understand if you guys feel different.

Any chance the factory would send them eu way as well gumburger? If so I'd like a pair and we could probably rustle up some more buyers.

@bigben seeing as how those carvons worked out so well, these would be infinitely better ðŸ‘Œ
