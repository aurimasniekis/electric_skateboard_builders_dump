I ordered a koowheel, I know that's not cool on here but I was wondering if anyone knew where to get replacement wheels for the hub motors (the plastic around the motor). For a start what are they called?

It's called urethane (the wheel around the motor is what you're talking about right?)

Have you tried contacting koowheel?

There are not PU replacements for the old model, there is a new updated model coming on June 2017 which will be possible and replacements will be available in our store.
