I found this deck on ebay, It has caliber and 83mm flywheel clones. Seems like a good price for just the two parts alone. The deck would be extra. What do you guys think ?

Looks tight on ground clearance but I suppose you can always move the trucks. I could certainly live with the board and wheels. I'm not keen on cheap trucks, I find them dead.
