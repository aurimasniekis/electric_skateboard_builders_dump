I just set up my board to my mini remote and it works flawlessly.  However, when I turn off my remote while my board is on, itll go full speed.  Is it supposed to do that because of connection issues? or is there a way to change it?

```
After the receiver binds, pull the binding plug with the receiver and remote still on and in neutral. 
Then turn off the receiver, then turn off the remote. 
Then turn on the receiver and remote. 
Then turn off the remote with the Receiver on to test failsafe.
