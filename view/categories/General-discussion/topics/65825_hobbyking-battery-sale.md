Yup...

I noticed that last night some of the Graphene's had almost halved in price, im keeping an eye on the chargers as well, im hoping :pray: the skyrc 400w dual gets a price slashing....

I ordered a 12s5 from @psychotiller, but it just comes with a little  2a charger. That will take FOREVER.... LOL
Don't really know what I need. 
Time to read

And yes I know of the issues with Multi-star
Maybe 2p Will make that a little better.

3S 6Ah 65C Graphene ones with 30% discount (Amazing batteries still holding after 4k miles)

https://hobbyking.com/en_us/graphene-6000mah-3s-65c-w-xt90.html?wrh_pdp=2

EDIT: I am running them in 12S 2P (now switched to 3P) but still with 9kW power train I had never had voltage sag, as some people saw I am riding full power until my board slow downs for 100m and literally stops :D It's so hard to feel when they running low...

Shit I ordered some 45c graphene just before the sale.... 
Do you know if returns are handled well by hobbyking? 

I'm tempted to return and reorder...

Those are same cells just in different configurations :) There is also 4S, 6S configurations all same cells just more cells in pack ;)

EDIT: 3S is easier to replace is something happens to the pack then 4S and 6S :)

How long you need with 20a from 0 to full, 15min?
```

Well depends on pack:

6Ah: 18min
12Ah: 36min
18Ah: 54min
24Ah: 72min

EDIT: Formula is simple. Capacity (Ah) / Charging Current (A) * 60 = 6Ah / 20A * 60s = 18min
```

Though about 6ah.
So i was already close with 15min ðŸ˜…
Thatâ€˜s really fast. 
How about balancing? Guess you use a bms for it. Can the cells balance in so short time or they balance only after fully charged which would mean your charging time will become longer.

To tell you the truth I am running without BMS, charge only with CC/CV (charger basically) these packs rarely go unbalanced too much...

But balance if big pack will take some time if its out of balance, also everything depends from BMS :)

I bought a Meanwell LED driver, works fine! "only" 10 amps charging but you can switch between 10s 11s and 12s charging
Without balancing of course... you need an extra bms

5a max!!! You don't need an 8a charger...
```

## \#23 Posted by: Andy87 Posted at: 2018-08-23T15:31:38.039Z Reads: 104

Just interested why only 5a. 
Ok low current charging prolong the lifespan of the cell, but besides?
I guess you use 30q cells for your packs.
They rated with 1.5a standard charge and 4a max charge current. So even with 1.5 you already at 7.5a on the 5p pack.
I bought that charger but didnâ€™t used it till now, so in case I got something wrong, better to know it now ðŸ˜…

Well? Battery life is one thing, but melted balance wires and possibly fire would be what I would worry about. I know the wire I use can handle 4a. Above that, i would recommend upgrading your charge and balance wires.

```
If the main charging wires can handle 4a than sure donâ€™t do it.
But
Charging current is not the balance current.
I looked up the specs of my bms and it says, balance current is 120ma and thatâ€™s the only current which should flow over balance wires.
Please correct me if I got something wrong, you the guy with more battery build experience.

David Bonde in Denmark, melted his negative charge lead with a 5a charger. He upgraded all of his charge and balance wires and has had no issues since.
