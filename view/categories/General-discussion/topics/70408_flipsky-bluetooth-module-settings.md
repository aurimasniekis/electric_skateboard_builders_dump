Can anyone walk me through setting up the flipsky bluetooth module with my Flipsky dual 6.6?
The problem I'm having is that using VESC tool mobile I can connect to the individual boards just fine but trying to use the master VESC to write settings to both esc's is not working. I am selecting CAN forwarding (1) in the app, is that correct? If someone could guide me towards a more general VESC tool mobile manual as well, that would help.

Everything works well now, I'm using an essential phone running Android Pie.
