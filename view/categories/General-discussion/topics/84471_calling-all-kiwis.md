Kiaora my bros!

I'm looking to see if we can leverage all New Zealand based members here to do mean stuff like organising local meets, group buys etc.. If you are the social type let me know! 

I'm Auckland based

Chur to the chur..

yeah for sure if there is a group buy thingy we want to do.. for example order in some motors..  Up in Auckland on a good day I've seen almost 10 different commuters on boards..  not sure if they are even in this forum..

might have to start stopping them.. although I've never seen a custom build to date

I don't see a lot of boards around, but I commute at stupid-oclock in the morning. Most boards I have seen are Evolve boards (naturally).... haven't seen a custom board yet (mine is).

Sweet...  yeah I haven't even built my first board yet..  just got a parts list.. hence why I'm keen to see if we can get a group buy..  I'm trying to talk a skater at work into also building one..

To be honest if I wasn't keen on spending 100s of hours with my 3D printer and writing code for a custom remote solution (i.e. just want to ride a board) I would buy an Evolve one off the shelf. Pity we are very limited in options in the South Pacific.

Kia ora! 

Few eSkaters in Chch. Dominantly Evolve, but some DIY options here and there.
Now that the Lime scooters are getting super popular, and regularly eating the dust of skaters, there's likely to get a bit more interested in skating. 
Rejoyce fellow kiwis cause Ali Express delays aren't completely bad for us.

Cheers bros!

yeah..  New Zealand isn't really on the radar for producers.. 

I did hassle Enertion for awhile.. i.e. getting them out here as part of their so called 'world tour'..  (seriously New Zealand is not on a world tour?)

I might be heading to San Fran in March.. but even then getting a board back is next to impossible... Air New Zealand won't even allow a electric mobility device (i.e. electric skateboard) even into their holds...    guess the tyranny of distance is still a thing

Yeah cool as bro for sharing that..  its something i've been thinking about for my build.. and since NZ has a pretty good rep for carbon fibre it seems like a logical way forward..

Good use of the vac bags from the warehouse!  and yeah I'll hit you up with questions when i get to the stage of making something..

Hamilton based rider/builder here üëã

I‚Äôd second @Sourcecode‚Äôs recommendation to join those Facebook groups. Pretty sure there are rides most weekends.

DIY scene is kinda grim here. But I‚Äôm keen as to be part of any local diy community, group buys, part swaps, and am totally keen to help out with any aspects of a DIY build (where I can, I‚Äôm no expert!)

Battery is the hardest bit in NZ, so I‚Äôd recommend focusing your attention there because you‚Äôre either gonna have to build your own or spend a tonne of cash. Though I think if you go for lipo you should be able to get what you need from a RC hobby store near you.

Here‚Äôs my build thread:

Yeah I've joined the group.. I did see about 20 riders in the New Market area about a week ago.. all riding carbons? but yeah that's a good sign..  

I've started a build.. and yeah I'll be building my own battery back.. I've got a background in Electronics Engineering..

Yeah at the moment i'm waiting for my motor mounts to arrive.. thanks to the entrepreneurial @Boardnamics..  then I'll start looking at the pulley system for these Abecs I'm running..  I'm going to make something up in inventor and then perhaps get something laser sintered if the price is right..

This in itself is interesting as ordering in some nice pulleys (metal) plus postage makes 3d metal printed parts feasible  (almost)..   So I'm gonna whip up some that is bespoke for the extended caliber trucks i'm running..  will probably replace the inner wheel bearing with a 8x22x14 wide bearing and press the pulley onto that then one more bearing on the inner side of the pulley mount..  should be pimp!

chur!

Rider/builder here also based in Hamilton. I only have lazy builds though. I just slap things together and once they're "ride-able", that's it for me.

![IMG_20190408_075303|666x500](upload://rmtOJ9d2RW8p6qeETckYnnwsdcp.jpeg) 

Did a landyachtz dinghy build, and love it! Light and compact. 

The sh*tty road here in Hamilton though can give me a heart attack while riding a short deck like this hence I tried to build an evolve clone - tried.

![IMG_20190408_074954|374x500](upload://onoaC1OMQq68ugDOaC8cg2eSOuM.jpeg) 

For short rides on familiar roads, or wet weather I usually use the dinghy. For longer rides/unfamiliar roads and dry weather, I use the AT board, when it's raining or the road is wet - it turns my clothes into a jackson pollock masterpiece made of mud.

And yes, parts can be quite difficult to come by. I use what I can find. For example my enclosures are baking tin from the warehouse and flower pot tray from bunnings.
@Scream do you have plans of making/selling custom enclosures for other people, e.g. me?) :smiley: 

Nice to know there are a few guys here in the forum.

Bro that landyachts build is siiiick! That‚Äôs my jam. 

You should come for a ride sometime. I ride with the evolve guys most Sundays.

I‚Äôll make you an enclosure bro. No charge. Got all the stuff sitting here might as well use it. Carbon fibre is kinda stupid though cos it blocks the signal to your remote.

That‚Äôs awesome @Jamiet - what‚Äôs the deck? I have a hankering to build again. I want something longer than my carver Proteus, but still that cruiser shape with a kicktail, and wheel wells so I don‚Äôt need massive risers. Thinking the BKB tayto... probably get the matching enclosure too.

Nice @doakickflip.. that's quite a kicktail on the little monster..  looks wicked!

@Scream the board is a [Kebbek Topmount 36](https://www.kebbekskateboards.com/collections/skateboards/products/topmount-36) with a very mild kick..  the concave allows for deep wells..  downside is I'll need to make a custom curved battery stack and enclosure to match.. so the carbon fibre route is likely in my future

I like that deck too (and was going to ask). I have a Loaded Truncated Tesseract which is also quite concave in places. Have spent 100s of hours designing and 3d printing an enclosure/enclosures for it.

Need to upload some photos at some stage.

Cool bro.. I'll have to hit you up for some tips.. I'm going to investigate routing into the deck to recess the batteries a bit.. Looking at designing and printing a guide jig for the router to sit in..

I haven't done any routing of the deck. Tempted but don't have a garage... and it would only get me maybe 5mm and potentially introduce some flex.

Maybe when I get the next deck I could have a play with the 'Ract.

Yeah I spoke to Kebbek about it.. They said watch out for warping as a freshly routed section will soak up moisture from the air..  So that's also a gotcha..

On other news got my motor mounts..

Good day guys, I'm from Christchurch and am planning on buying an electric skateboard, however are they fully legal to use on pathways and roads? According to NZTA, motorized skateboards have difficulties meeting the safety standards and other requirements, so they cannot be operated on the road.   This is the only thing I'm concerned of as I'm going to use it for commuting within the city and to school.

Yeah the law hasn't quite figured out what should happen with this form of transport.. But if I was you I'd play the role of a positive advocate for the tech..    I use a scooter for commutes mostly and drive it like if it was a bicycle.. Adhering to the same rules etc.. Staying off footpaths as pedestrians are too random... Wear a helmet.. Respect the road rules etc..   Remember these devices are the future of urban mobility as cars start to dissappear from the street.. If we play nice local governments and transport authorities will provide lanes dedicated for use..   But as always it can all be ruined by one moron.. Like how lime scooters have been taken off the streets in Auckland when one idiot took out a pedestrian at a bus stop which the bus driver ran over..  So don't be that idiot...
