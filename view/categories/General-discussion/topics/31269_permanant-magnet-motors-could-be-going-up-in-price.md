Neodymium raw material prices have gone up about 25% just in 2017 and over 50% in under a year and are expected to rise more.  most expensive part in a motor.

Yeah there is a shortage and I am all ready seeing the effect.. law of supply and demand is in full force.. 

For the total price of an eSk8 motor it dosnt affect it that much (atleast as of now).

Can't do much when the largest market share of neodymium is all owned by China. The largest producer of rare earth metals is China.

The magnets are by far the most expensive part now though. If they keep rising like this, you will see a huge impact in the future.
