This message goes out to the enertion team, I have tried to contact you on multiple occasions, using multiple social media venues but to no avail I am still left ignored and wanting answers. I want to be refunded in full on order # 26215 also my ticket order says that the total is $2083. And I am expecting to receive my refund with no percentage retained by enertion for so called “administrative fees” due to the many missed deadlines for delivery and the poorest quality of communication on your behalf as a company. @EnertionSupport

You should escalate this with the service you used to pay for the stuff. Enertion seems to have no moral compass.

I dont remember who, but someone tried to use "the 110% refund if not satisfied" claim, and was never given a refund period.  Gather evidence and log everything. When the payment company asks you for documentation you will have it.

It seems the most productive way to reach enertion these days is by sending a pm to @adrianenertion.

Don’t know if you have tried that yet, but I noticed you have a fairly new account so maybe give it a try.

I have a similar situation. How long has it been since your first attempt to contact them? I heard they were on some kind of tour, so that might be a reason they are delayed. That is not a good reason to stop support if you ask me. If they don't respond in within x amount of time your best option is to contact your payment company to get your money back.

I have had a all around bad experience with this company, it has been 4-5 days since my first request to get a refund. But they just replied with only words of more promises, and asking if there was any other packages/products I would want instead of my refund; to which I retorted with there is nothing you can give me besides my money.

call your credit/debit card and do a chargeback.

Or if u used paypal contact them.

This way they cannot keep the unlawful 10/15% admin charges and they end up with a $25 charge for being a bad merchant and getting charge backs... HIT THEM WHERE IT HURTS AND DO A  CHARGEBACK!!!!!!

Do not waste your life trying to contact Enirtion then will lie to you and laugh behind your back that your an idiot for belieivng them

I'll give them a few more days, but if they don't come through soon I will do the same. I don't need unnecessary bridge burning if they are really just swamped.

Do note that if you live in the EU you are protected by consumer laws. IANAL but you can get 100% money back, even if you return it within a few days. It also gives you a 1 year warranty by law.

they are not too busy they are just ignoring customers because they think their custoemrs are stupid and thye can do what they want and people will still buy their products and wait 6months for delivery (completely runining an entire year of riding for hundreds of people by missing the summer) All because they dont want to run their business like professionals and order in stock instead they let the custoemrs wait collect pre-orders and then do nothing till their next preorders are collected so they can order 300 or 500 units for huge discount (probable about $30USD per unit and sell them to you for $300 and make you wait a year all the time pretending the unit will be delivered within 2 or 3 months knowing the whole time it will be 6-9months)

Again IANAL, but I quote:

However, if you buy from a non-EU online trader who has specifically targeted EU consumers you should also be covered by EU rules, but you may find it difficult to assert your rights with a trader who is based outside the EU.

I'm not sure how they define specifically (either sells only to or sells and ships to), but if it's the latter it should be covered. If the European law doesn't cover it [the Australian law does](https://www.accc.gov.au/consumers/consumer-rights-guarantees/consumer-guarantees).

Exactly, that's why I'm still giving them a chance. I just got a message from Enertion saying they are working on it, and as long as there is some communication (to a limit) I'll be waiting patiently. Everyone will be worse off with a chargeback if it could be resolved otherwise. It's a nuclear option which should be used with care.

So if Enertion are not honouring their commitments in providing you a refund or simply not responding and you have no other alternative to get your money back, I would advise you to make an application for a trader dispute with them through Queensland Civil and Administrative Tribunal. Enertion are an Australian company and Australia has very strict and clear rules when it comes to supplying products within advertised timeframes (search Australian Competition and Consumer Commission - failure to supply a product). I have already put in an application with the tribunal and can provide you with all of Enertions company details and represent you here in Queensland if you would also like to make an application.

If you live in the EU try to explain to them the very strict consumer-protection laws here. I managed to get a 100% refund that way. As any fees for a refund are outlawed here. Also it is very easy to do a chargeback in this situation.

Good luck !

I've said it before and I will say it again if that 20% bullshit held any sway then all the shops my wife spends money in would not have to sell a damn thing.  She buys 10 items and takes 5 back.  Regularly. Just because a company has a policy does not make it legal.  Consumer rights are kind of similar the world over except maybe for colombia.  Pretty sure if you try to return certain products you get your head cut off but thats extreme.

Enertion did give my some communication back since my last message, and @CarlCollins was really helpful back then. He decided that my bootloader was corrupt, and said he was coming with a fix soon (which was all great). Last message received was more than two weeks ago... I'm getting really tired of this shit. As this seems to be a really basic MCU I could flash the bootloader myself, but I'm worried about breaking even further which would then be my fault. Can I please get a response? I wanted to try my board weeks ago, but thanks to Enertion I can't. I'm really tempted to do that charge back after all and just get a different VESC...

Can we see a pattern here???

Here is the solution....
Take out credit or debit card used to buy cheap item from china.
turn over card
call number on back of card
explain to them the item has not been received.

BOOM!!! ENIRTION GETS A $50 fine for the charge-back, and you get 100% of your money back!!!!

With all due respect Carl, your being very disingenuous. If you really think "implementation of the new ticket handling system" is a reasonable excuse for the way Enertion is currently treating it's customers, you really need to get out of your customer service role. You're really fooling no one. 

Currently your company owes people boards that they ordered back in the first few months of the year, over 6 months ago. You're still sending out wheels that are not round that have a failure mode which has a high chance of causing injury. You're refusing refunds on products which people have waited nearly 3x the original wait time.

Your company offered me early delivery if I would delete posts off of this forum, and then FAILED ON THEIR PROMISE. The link to the delisted thread they offered be early delivery on https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/raptor-2-1-delivery-awol-no-responses-from-enertion/98933

All this while your CEO skates his arse around the world racking up more orders which you can't fill, since you can't even make a round urethane wheel that lasts more than half a dozen charges.

All this being said and you still refuse to refund me for an order I made back in March, because apparently all your money is tied up in litigation in China.

Now the newest news is you can't even afford to pay your staff, so they're holding some of your product hostage, since they expect you to rip them off.

Well I for one don't know what to believe, but I can guarantee you that the core of your company's issues is not a ticketing system. The fact you think it is, should have us all more worried.

I look forward to meeting either you or one of your colleagues at our legal hearing next week.

Give me back my money.

Edit: Added link to delisted thread.

Let's not forget that not paying employees is most likely caused by the implementation of a new ticketing system too. A system that may have already been implemented back in

https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/is-enertion-awol/96794/15?u=telnoi

I have been around these forums for some time now and the ticketing system keeps popping up as an excuse...along with supply chains, firing incompetent people/companies that are part of the whole process (strangely enough they still seem to be around causing the same issues... Maybe it's the founder).

Burned hands is a new one. If it truly happened I am sorry, but even there I have my doubts.

Asking people to remove evidence of slow shipping in order to acquire new orders? That's a new low. Not uncommon, but in this case a very obvious move for large scale damage control.

Ohhh, now they've got me mad.

 - They took a long time to deliver my unity, which I've accepted.
 - They f*cked up there ticketing system, delaying support for two whole weeks, which I've accepted.
 - They probably time it to only respond to me once every 2 days, which I've accepted.

I don't think I've been a bad customer. I've always been nice, patient and resonable. But now they took it too far. So what did they do?

[quote="Support Leader"]
Hi Dany, Thanks for reaching out to us about this problem.

Due to huge demand for our customer support resources, we currently cannot provide high-end technical support for focbox unity configurations with 3rd party items.

Let me know if you have any specific ideas on how we can assist you with this and we will try to accommodate you.

Kind Regards
[/quote]

They don't even dare to sign there name on it, which is understandable. I'm just asking for the hex file of the bootloader, **so I can do there job for them**. I'm not asking then for any troubleshooting or complicated questions. Just a single file which is probably on the computer they send the response with. What I think is the most comical thing about this is that they **asked** me to use the 3rd party item (which is just a STLink, a common tool which they use for development too), and now they say they don't support it? That is just full on BS. And all this while there dear @onloop is skating around the world, like his company is not falling apart.

I really want to @CarlCollins,  I really do. But then why are you making it so damn hard?

I already  missed the entire summer of riding my board because of this f*king unity. I was refered to @Deodand for this file, [but he seems to be ignoring me](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/focbox-unity-support-setup-troubleshooting/77861/2110?u=atlasdev). I also send him a DM earlier, which he has seen but has not responded to.

I think I'll be contacting my CC company for a charge-back later today, unless they come with a solution **soon**.

I actually haven't got the time to be on the forum these days as we are trying to get the emails responded ASAP!
So you can blame me for that but about the statement I've given above, it's true that the ticket system affects all of the other stuff as well because they are all interlinked, we haven't only changed our ticket system we've actually done many internal changes which I am not able to disclose in public because I am  just an employee of Enertion.
From my end, I always try to be as much transparent as possible but you guys must be aware that I have boundaries set by Enertion as well which I am not allowed to cross.
Still I am willing to help each of you guys with all of my effort.

The thing I was (am) so mad about was that email. In my eyes it basically said "hai, thanks for your money, but you're now too much of an hassle to deal with. Shoot us a message if you have easier questions. Ktnxbai.".

I am sympathetic of what you are going through (to a point ofc). But that took me over the edge. I hope you can hold up your promise because I do really want to solve this the easy way. If I didn't I wouldn't have bought that stlink with my own money. Even if that means that I get to be a "mushroom" a little longer, as other people might say here. 😉

TLDR: Don’t ask enertion for the product you paid for, support or your money back. 

There needs to be a thread to alert new comers to the hobby. I feel like both forums have way less activity over the past couple months and all the failed products don’t help (read paid for and undelivered). There also seems to be no repercussions. 
 
Sellers to avoid: enertion, ollin board, carvon, marbel, jed board. Just to start

Hey Atlasdev,

I'm so sorry that this situation is causing you to be so frustrated. Building electric skateboards is very challenging and your build has lots of parts that aren't common & they are items that have NOT been tested to work by enertion. Even so, we do want to help as best we can.

Firstly, let me apologize for the delays in delivery and explain the situation, the reason Focbox Unity orders got delayed originally was due to safety concerns! Two guys went flying off their boards and broke their bones, it a pretty big concern for us. 

We decided to stop production because we had to fix the firmware and make sure the product was thoroughly tested before we re-commenced shipping. This delay was not accepted by a big majority of people on this forum, seems some people would prefer less safe products and faster delivery? 

Anyway, we started getting hit with chargebacks, in the end, we lost about 150K, unfortunately, we already paid the suppliers deposits for orders. This loss of capital seriously hurts a small manufacturing business like enertion and it just means that we suffer from more delays as we cannot pay our suppliers, meaning orders get delayed even more. Without free-flowing cash, we simply can't produce our orders or offer high-end technical support.

 **So please reconsider doing a chargeback, that's not the solution, it hurts us and makes our job nearly impossible.**

----

**NOW ONTO YOUR PROBLEM**

1. **You connected the unity to your motors and tried to set it up, but your motors make a loud noise.**
*troubleshooting this fault over email / forum wasn't successful, sorry we could n't fix your build issues we are not familiar with your motors or your controller*

2. **Now you had problems loading new firmware and this may have made the Focbox Unresponsive.** *Once again, it's hard for us to solve these types of problems via email, all focbox unities are tested and loaded with the latest firmware available at the time of manufacturing. Currently, we don't support loading hex files, that is outside our scope of the warranty.* 

3. **You have a board that you want to finish building.**
*We can give you some details about repair agents that are likely able to help you, this is not covered under warranty.*

We are happy to keep helping you with your problems, but please note, considering the situation, this is not work we can cover under warranty. There will be some cost to get this repair done.

Let me know if you have any questions.
```

We have had a tough run, it's true. Lots of chargebacks severely impacted our production plans.

But we always deliver, eventually! - Can't say that for some companies.

Goods news is we have some really big batches of orders finishing up. everyone who orders gets their products. We also have our ticketing system in much better shape now. Way too many people emailing us for support on their DIY builds, we obviously can't solve everyone DIY issues and nor should we have to. It clogs up the system.

Correct me if I'm wrong Carl. But those 50 boards you're about to send out still have the wheels that fall apart before 200kms potentially injuring the rider. 

If you delayed production of the unity due to 2 people falling off your boards, why are you continually shipping boards where the wheels are known to fall off?

Now considering the range of the board is reported to be 40kms, and the wheels dont last 200kms, you're pushing a product that lasts for 5 recharges on average before its time to change the wheels and play russian roulette with the pavement again.

So while youre so proud of sending out your faulty boards, I would argue sending out those boards knowing their mode of failure is negligent. The products are not fit for purpose under Australian Consumer Law and need to be refunded. Considering its a known ongoing issue if anyone injures themselves on your faulty product damages will be granted due to negligence.

Thanks for your feedback hobz - manufacturing hardware is really hard and we are not yet experts at it. pretty much every electric skateboard company has got some embarrassing history that they would rather people forgot about.

Ok, so you have some goods points, let me clear things up for you.

1. Bad Wheel quality is not affecting 100% of all customers, it's an issue related to the raw materials used in some batch of wheels. We identified these batches and discarded hundreds of wheels. However some did slip through the net because we didn't have serial numbers on our wheels it was hard to locate & seperate the bad from the good. We are confident that this problem has been reduced significantly. However it extremely hard to check for bad quality in wheels without riding on them. So we are monitoring it very closely and have new formulas slowly entering into the production pipeline. I think this is a well documented issue now and our customers will report any issues to us & we report this back to the wheel factory and they get new wheels sent for free. We will also be making some wheels in california wheel factory and they should be read later in the year. We expect the quality of those to be superior. However, they will still eventually wear out. These wheels are consumables and eventually need to be replaced.

2. The range of the board is up to absolute MAX of 40 km range, this is written clearly on the website. Most fully grown adult men realistically would get between 25km & 35km. I think most people understand that range is a variable depending on temperature, wind, terrain etc. The Raptor has about 3x the range of a boosted board for the same price. In fact the Raptor is ranked in the top three for range in this price category.

3. We are definitely NOT proud to send out products with faults, hence why we constantly delay production to improve parts or change assembly factories if the quality control is slipping. But strangely some of our customers do seem to insist that we speed up production despite the problems we face. It's a tricky balance between quality & speed - this is something we are dedicated to solving.

We will be dropping this policy very soon actually, we are extremely close to having all our back orders filled and it is our intention to sell from "instock" inventory only. We achieved this primarily by restructuring our B2B model. Once this milestone is achieved we don't need to have the order retention incentive! 

ALSO, its worth noting, This policy of 20% cancellation fee is clearly written on our website. We never tried to hide it. Basically we just don't want people to order from us if they might eventually cancel. The cancelled orders are what causes massive delays because we cannot afford to pay the suppliers in a timely manner meaning everyone else gets impacted by delays. Even just a few cancelled orders can cause weeks of delays.

Historically, the pre-order model is a failure, many other companies have failed due to this model, and we are trying to move away from that as fast as possible.

I want to get to the heart of the problem for me. Why do you think its reasonable to decline a full refund on a board that was estimated to be delivered in 8-10 weeks, that still hasnt been received 22 weeks later after missing 4 seperate deadlines, and several broken promises?

How do you expect your customers to feel being treated this way? Do you think its fair?

We are very sorry for this situation hobz all refunds will be processed once it is financially possible. 

From my understanding, huge amounts of cash were invested into big orders to ramp up production and satisfy the growing demand for enertion products. Our goal this year was to transition from doing pre-sale to holding stock in warehouses in USA & Europe and only selling items that were in stock. That requires huge capital investment & enertion doesn't have any angel investors willing to loan them the huge lump sums of cash, the business has been bootstrapped by Jason from the beginning, he also has invested his own personal money into this and does not earn any wage from the business.

Sadly it seems our big plan got derailed after some unforeseen issues, like the focbox unity firmware bug & jig redesign, assembly factory failing to deliver according to agreed quality criterias, wheel factory delivery bad batches etc, which resulted in factory relocations etc...  all these issues caused long delays and ultimately following this is a huge amount of chargebacks due to order delays. There are people on this forum actively promoting the option of chargebacks, it extremely damaging concept and should not be done as innocent people get hurt by that.

When people do chargebacks the banks take money out of enertion account immediately no questions asked, whether the funds are present of not, because enertion paid so much money to build up inventory there is now financial strain on the company. This issue can be resolved, but it's a slow process.

The good news is that 100 boards just got finished & another 300 are in the pipeline for completion over the next 8 to 12 weeks. Since suppliers will not return the money, they will only deliver the parts that were ordered enertion must push through and complete these orders & once stock has arrived enertion can finally start making some sales campaigns for the Raptor & Unity again to recover the cash. The unity will be available in amazon USA store in about 4 weeks.

This is obviously a terrible situation for people who ordered products then changed their minds and asked for refunds, the timing is really bad, but enertion always delivers! We have never failed to deliver on our promises. We have had to make some big changes and had to restructure the business to make it operate more efficiently and the improvements are already starting to appear.

Hobz, We are very sorry that this transaction hasn't gone to plan, we must now work harder than ever before to improve and we will demonstrate this in the near future. Nobody will be forgotten.

1. There is a reason for the charge backs (numerous delays, chicken and the egg story. What came first, the delays or the charge backs) 
2. The delays started before the redesign of the test jig and firmware bug, which should have popped up if only the product was properly tested
3. You just confirmed that enertion solemnly relies on public funding for their manufacturing process. Free loans, playing a dangerous game due to lack of own capital. 
4. Number 3 should never have happened and would have avoided 1. You would have had stock. 

Don't start blaming the customer for losing trust in a company due to numerous mistakes make by Enertion. What did you truly expect would happen?

So I've basically been tricked into funding a kickstarter campaign but I'm still paying top dollar and receiving no return on my investment. If this was an investment opportunity into a company to receive a board when it was available for production and not a contract for sale why wasn't it stipulated? The law is very clear on the difference, or am I misunderstanding you? 

Why isn't is possible to simply take the money from your next Raptor sale, and give it to whomever is requesting a refund, and reallocate that board?

The only reason I can see is that the company is so riddled with debt that all sales are covering your debts, and your company is on the verge of collapse as it continues to expose itself to more and more backorders. Combined with the companies return rate, the fact that it isn't paying it's staff (Baja and Jason at the least apparently), and reports from former staff that the company is broke, leads me to think Enertion's bankruptcy could very likely happen. 

When this happens who will be the innocent people that lose money Carl? 

We're currently in the stage where your company feeds us excuses and promises in order to stop the flow of chargebacks, because you have failed to deliver on your contract of sale. When a company needs to break the law (this I intend to prove) in order to stay afloat, I can't see why you would expect people to let you hold onto their money. In fact, I think any financial advisor would strongly recommend to cut and run.

I really appreciate the time you've taken to answer my questions Carl, but I don't feel safe in the fact you have nearly AUD$3000 of my money, and I'd like it all returned.

Good to see your dumping the 20% bullshit. Probably would have saved you all these chargebacks (and a lot of trust/public image/ customer perceived professionalism). 

Just hope you guys didn’t do something horrible like use the unity startup funds to get the Raptor into retail stores as your emails around that time mentioned...thereby slowing the unity output to a trickle to maintain customer trust.

But let me be completely clear, definitely no accusations, just seen it happen a couple times now. Doesn’t end well usually.

removing preorder from the websites product description to promote sales when you don’t have the item in stock is dishonest. 9 weeks isn’t in stock. This, which was a surprise to me in the first place is now overdue and there’s others in way worse positions.

Surely you can see these types of things are what causes customers to resort to chargebacks and is 100% extortions fault especially when breaching consumer law regardless if it’s in the terms and conditions or not.

It was an expensive (to me) lesson to learn and when the company finishes its world tour and realizes that maybe that money would have been better spent fulfilling orders and goodwill with existing customers than trying to drum up more suckers it’ll be too late and I’ll just have to chalk up my order as a contribution to Jason’s holiday trip around the world when the whole operation goes belly up. Yay.

Yes it is covered, as you are required to deliver a product meeting the expectations under both EU (for me) and Australian law (for you). This is a minimum guarantee, and not something you can change by some "policy". I hate to make a treat with a charge-back again, but if you refuse to help and comply with the law I don't see another choice.

How can a company fail so badly making a 10x profit margin on an item they never even touch???

Hey guys. For anyone interested, I originally contacted Enertion for a refund after they failed to deliver on time (I ordered back in May). I never received a refund and lodged a complaint through our local civil tribunal to get my money back after they didn't respond. The tribunal attempts remediation as a first resort, however, even after mailing their registered business address and mailing address with the documents, no one showed up to the session this morning. 

I emailed and sent a Facebook message to Enertion this morning asking them to contact me to see if they wanted to do a payment arrangement, however clearly no one there has the professionalism and decency to respond. So now it has to go through the courts so I can get my money back from these guys.

Put it this way, if customers have to take a business to court just to get their money back for a product they never received, that business shouldn't be operating. If anyone has found themselves in a similar situation with these bunch of fraudsters, please do us all a favour and spread the word so no one else gets ripped off as well.

Let's not be silly, I think you're trying to infer that the majority of your returns are "change of mind," we're not changing our minds, we're suffering through pain we never subscribed for.

Again, we didn't "change our minds," Enertion broke the original agreement. Then Enertion broke its follow-up promise of delivery within the next month. Then when we begged for an update and didn't receive one till a month later, Enertion failed to deliver on that deadline too.

No I actually had a change of heart and thought I would give them one last chance to work something out in a perfectly reasonable email.

"I have just been reading a post on the Esk8 forum where Carl has explained some of the reasons why there has been delays in the deliveries of the Raptors and about the large amount of chargebacks that have been hurting the company.

I recently submitted a trader dispute with QCAT about my order, as I never received it within the stated time frame (I ordered back in May). No one showed up to the mediation meeting this morning despite several copies of the documents being delivered to Jason's addresses.

I had planned to post several messages to the thread on my experiences just now, until I came across Carl's comments on why there have been delays. As much as I'm tempted to be spiteful and discourage anyone from buying products from Enertion, I understand sometimes there can be problems in coming up with the capital to purchase the parts. I'm not saying that excuses the lack of planning and the promises of deliveries for stock you don't have, or the blatant ignoring of messages, but if you guys are in dire straits and are genuinely trying to resolve these issues, I thought I would at least give you a chance to respond first.

I have since purchased another board and have no need for the Raptor anymore so am still seeking a refund. However, if you are not able to supply a refund at the moment, I understand. What I would like is some sort of confirmation from you guys stating when the refund, plus QCAT fees, (because to be fair I didn't receive a response the entire week before submitting) will be paid. If you aren't in a position to refund it right now, let me know when you are and we can work that out."

They never replied, so I decided to undo the post deletion. I could simply get my bank to do the chargebacks, however I've decided to take them to court.

My mediation with Enertion is on Monday. Pretty sure I'll get the same turnout as you JollyRoger. When I have my order to pay from the tribunal, i'll be taking Enertion to court also. If people still have money in Enertions hands, it's time to talk to your bank, lest you risk losing it permanently. 

As much as Enertion can ignore Tribunal hearings, they can't ignore a summons to court. They will need to lawyer up, creating them more costs, and taking away more of their time, and it could likely end up with the company being found to be unable to service it's debts, and bankruptcy/liquidation could follow.

I honestly hope this works out well for everyone, but I can't see it happening.

This has been their way of doing business since the beginning. Lots of promise and little delivery. Everyone needs to stop sending their money based on empty promises and the problem might go away.

My biggest reason for not wanting enertion to go bankrupt is getting Bara paid
[/quote]

Wow reading this made be very happy. Thanks guys I appreciate the support. I don’t want anyone else to get hurt like I did from these guys. No need for a fund. I’m doing okay now, my new job is great. Enertion fucked me over for a good month or two (really hard times) but I’m doing good now.


I just sent off an email to @adrianenertion and Jason with a final call to action. If they don’t pay me today, I’ll be taking further action. Aka, may have to liquidate their things to recoup my salary. 

I hate to do it but it’s business. I don’t want to do it, makes me feel like I’m selling someone else’s things but they refuse to pay me any time soon and I can’t just wait for when their business picks up (I think we can all agree it won’t likely soon), I quit nearly a month and a half ago. At some point, I need to draw the line and get my due salary.

Just liquidate their stuff in my opinion, if they come looking for it let them know (after making them wait 4-6 weeks for your reply) that their goods are tied up in litigation in the Congo and you're not in a financial position to help.

On a serious note, the administrators from the NSW tribunal called me on Friday. They've been trying to contact Enertion for 4 weeks now and haven't received a response, I told them that they're being treated the same way as all their customers. They let me know that they'll be making a judgement on the claim in Enertion's absence. 

I'm actually looking forward to Enertion trying to pull the same ridiculous shit when they're summoned to court. There will be a smug ear to ear grin on my face when they get charged with contempt.

Think of it this way, if you were enertion and actually had unitys to ship, why wouldn't you ship them?

There is a great practice in business called UPOD. 

Under promise, over deliver.

Enertion went with the OPUD model and trusted their suppliers a bit too well in my opinion. Who knows who dropped the ball here... It was certainly a big ball dropped though.

**Just do the charge back even if he liquidates the company he will get away with not paying you that way too and not sending customers their items.**

**1- take out credit card,**

**2- turn over credit card,** 

**3- Call your credit card and do the charge back they will get hit with the$50 fine but you WILL GET YOUR MONEY BACK!!**

**dont let them fool you they think everyone is an idiot and they can rip us off and string you along with false promises or re-using excuses they used before**

**or the best excuse they are giving.. "its the customers who are fed up with our flat out lies and did chargebacks that has caused our company to implode"**


Outsourcing to china to make a product(unity in this case) that cost $30USD to make (as the invoice in the box tells us when we receive the items drop shipped from china with original receipt) Then charging over $300USD (a 10x mark up) and never keeping items in stock.

How can a company fail so badly making a 10x profit margin on an item they never even touch???

I will say this. I had. Raptor 1, great board after I fixed all the downfalls, I ordered a Raptor 2 and waited over a year for it with many many failed promises and I built many boards in the meantime while I was waiting.

I use the Unity and think it's a fantastic product with that being said my opinion is that the Raptor 2 is not worth waiting for. It has so many problems its not even funny. Not to mention things like efficiency sucks that's why people get sub 15mil range on a 10s4p 30q battery. Also once the motors heat up they loose performance so once you hit that top speed and got everything all nice a toasty just pray that you dont need to stop quickly. 

Get another board or go DIY, My Raptor 2 truly disappointed me on every single level.

They are fulfilling orders by accepting new orders and are currently focusing on fulfilling large orders made by resellers to further finance their operations. Those with small orders are just placed in a seemingly endless queue. 

 If the regular consumer no longer purchases from resellers, the scheme they have used to keep themselves afloat will be broken.

As many don't care about the above, those who stock the unity will sell their unities quickly enough, especially due to the scarsety enertion creates. In short, Enettion will survive to fool customers yet again when the next hot product drops, which I imagine to be a 14s capable esc.

Want to stop this as a community? Just don't buy, get or wait for an alternative. Make a plead to known resellers.

There are multiple people here and on YouTube reporting that they have not received refunds after waiting for several months (these are orders in excess of 2400 USD for Raptors), only to receive an official email stating that Enertion cannot refund due to financial issues. the money is held hostage and is essentially used as a free loan.

This is a hobby that many people take very serious. Some have had to skip a whole season of riding due to empty promises and had to buy their hardware elsewhere, setting them back financially. Then there is the constant stress of having to deal with their support and the potential worry of simply not receiving a refund, unless you threaten them with lawsuits or constantly nag them. 

It impacts people more severely than you might think.

I'm happy that things worked out in your case, but Carl also disappeared multiple times when others tried to get support through him and on top his hands are tied by the general policy of Enertion. Nobody is getting their money back, unless you make it happen on your end.

I just noticed that my recent thread got deleted where I detailed my Raptor 2.1 internals catching fire and then Enertion taking my board, promising a refund, and then never providing a refund. It's been 6 months already, and I haven't heard anything from them since the beginning of August despite multiple emails. 

Now after this deleted thread, it feels like I'm being silenced... This is just adding insult to injury after being cheated out of $1400. The thread only contained factual events and information, I just wanted to warn others here so no one else falls for the same trap I did.

the mods and owners of the forum.. the same guy who has your money... will always try and silence you saying "your flaming" and delete the thread.

instead simply ask a question dont make any statement.

Did your Enirtion raptor 2 catch fire too?

IS the Enirtion raptor bursting into flames normal?

How long have you waited for your enirtion refund?

Share your enirtion stories here?

Asking questions is not a statement and cannot be twisted that you are flaming anyone

I would also contact your credit card provider and explain the situation if it was done on a credit card they will be able to help get the funds recovered.

I made a writeup of the steps I needed to go through to fix it if anyone else has a simular issue. You can find it here: [How to fix a broken Unity bootloader](https://bit.ly/2VD3vPs).

Enertion is removing links to this site, so if the link suddenly breaks go to `forum (d0t) esk8 (d0t) news` and search for `How to fix a broken Unity bootloader`.

*Edit*: it has finally happened, took them long enough. I've replaced the link with a shortened version.

Enertion is actively putting themselves closer to bankruptcy. This isn't a partnership. It's something along the lines of Enertion needing up front money (again) and needing someone to buy a large quantity in order to get product moved out. It's a last ditch effort that many failing businesses attempt. Usually still falling short in the end.

No human being can withstand such a continuos ammount of complains on public forums, so I understand your decision completely @CarlCollins, I've read how you tried to calm people down and avoid imminent charge backs, big props to you for that but there seems to be no solution for Enertion unless they fullfil pending raptor orders, stop raptor production and just focus on the unity which is still the company best product and has good reputation.

Enertion is still there, I choose to part ways from it as they are in the critical situation and don't want me to drag along with them.
They are still trying to make the company and product work again and I always wish for Enertion to stay put so you guys will get what you always wanted from them.

I always hope for the best so fingers are crossed.

Currently, I am an unemployed person (currently) and struggling to find a new Job, I hope I will get one soon. :slight_smile:

I bought my board about the This year on June or July and it has broken down ever since that time and it's just one problem after another.
This Months problem is that, when I plug my board into the power brick the red light flash's and nothing happens. I tried to contact the support line (AGAIN) but they aren't responding.
All and all, I wasted my money I should have never trusted this company and my 1,500 dollars I won't see again. I hate it so much, What a Waste! Ugh it's so useless it just broken and Never Works! Omfg.. I'm so disappointed in myself for trying to even think this board can make my life better, I don't even have a car, I thought using this board will fix my problems but no. F, I hate myself.

Carl, I am new to this forum and not belittling the assistance you gave in the past but my experience with you was not positive. I also had trouble with my Unity and tried to claim under warranty. All of my multiple emails got ignored until I falsely claimed I wanted to buy two new Raptors. Within about 10 hours (overnight) you replied and were happy to tell me all about the Raptor, when you thought there was a sale in it. I immediately came clean with you about why I was emailing and I was put straight back on ignore.

Whilst at Enertion you were more than happy to suck more people into their mess and are now here offering to help everyone out. A bit rich (and unethical) to be honest, since you were part of the problem only last week..

Carl, I don't know you and don't want to come across as argumentative but that is a pretty weak response in my opinion. Sounds like the old "I was just following orders" excuse trotted out by people for years. If there is a different explanation why would you not give it??

I stick by my comments, you knew the situation at Enertion and still actively tried to extract money from people knowing they would likely never see their products. I work in the legal profession and another way of putting it is... FRAUD, that's the bottom line.

Bill, I don't have an issue calling someone out on their poor behaviour. There are countless people around the world who probably have the same view given that they have been ripped off for thousands of dollars. I gather you aren't one of those people.

About this thing, I don't think I will be getting any of the money by doing that, will I?

I don't think so but still you are calling and blaming me for it.

Man, all I can say is there are many protocols that customers are not aware of so it might be the fault of the perspective you are viewing it by so there is no one to blame about it.

Honestly, if it's was in my personal hands, situation might be quite different.

Now, considering that this is no longer the case, logic would suggest that you are not obliged to follow those rules.  That is, unless you have signed a non disclosure agreement, they owe you money, or the carrot of being rehired when Enertion's financial situation recovers has been dangled in front of you.  

Nobody is angry at you particularly, however as you are in a unique position of knowledge, people are quite reasonably looking for answers to interpret Enertion's corporate conduct and policies (of which you would be aware). 

Now, I would not suggest that you need to insult or lay blame on any individual, but perhaps providing a factual recollection of how complaints/queries were responded to (or not responded to) might provide some useful insight to forum members. 

Of course @barajabali could also share his unique insight but I will leave that up to him.

I agree with you @baxter . To give you a hint about it.
When I joined this company or if you join any company, you always sign a contract to not disclose all of the things to the customer base.
It's kind of the basic rule in the business.
There are multiple reasons for not disclosing everything publicly.
and one of them is restriction and 2ndly, lack of information when multiple departments are involved.
I always ignore or haven't responded to the emails because of the following reasons 
**1: Only person handling the emails**
**2: Filters are not working correctly**
**3: Was advised to follow up on some picked cases. (Special ones)**
**4: Only have information about some of the things**
**5: Picked the cases which I think I am able to answer without any assistance or info required from other departments.**

I think it's more than enough explanation.
@barajabali He is well aware of it as he also faced it.

Lastly, I do understand that @Jima9645 is really upset about his situation with the board.
Luckily when he initiated the email, I was clearing all of the new tickets first because I don't want any email to be left unanswered when it came in, Kind of trying to answer every new email with an initial response at least. That's why I responded to him but after that more emails came in and I started to answer them from bottom to top and still I wasn't able to answer all of them due to the quantity. 

I am sorry about it but I don't know why I have to be sorry even though I tried as much as I can to answer as many emails as possible. *(I am not trying to be rude here)*

How so? Selling products that you either don't have or reasonably believe can't be supplied, not honouring warranties, not even returning emails is totally unethical. 

Obtaining a benefit by trickery or deceit is the very definition of fraud.

 I am amazed that you continue to defend this.

 Obviously this discussion will get nowhere. 

Nobody is getting their money back or the products they have paid for. The only way forward from here is legal action (if you have the resources and energy) and ensuring you tell your story where ever you can to ensure nobody else gets defrauded.

Both have helped me out over the years, and I appreciate it.

Enertion website have changed the wheels shipping date once again...now its december...let me guess...they want the best formula possible so they started over again...going on december i reckon that, and this is ONLY a guess, they will push forward another month cause they still not sure about that formula...on 2025 they will still be chasing the pink dragon and pushing even further for new formula that includes admantium (same stuff that goes into wolverine’s bones) but its still not quite there...so they will speak with thanos and find the 5 infinity stones to come up with the ultimate formula for wheels but i reckon if we wait until then we could wait until we travel to the underworld and come up with the undying everlasting wheels...
This sound promising but i may be dead by then...thanks enertion...

So whats the current state with enertion? Are they bankrupt? There site is still online and I can order the Raptor and Unity. ..but will never get them?!?
I have a Raptor 2.1 and love it. Bad range but great Power with a stealthy look. The only thing is I need new wheels and I have no idea where to get them. Will they ever be produced again?
Should I wait for some wheels to be produced or try to sell the Raptor? What would you do?
Thanks.

Enertion is pretty much dead. I wouldn't buy from them.

Get a different drivetrain and slap it on there. 

Upgrade battery to 21700 maybe.

Yeah Jason is not currently shipping our orders.
