I am trying to adjust some settings on the raptor 2 but the bldc tool I downloaded from enertion website is not compatible with the raptor 2 stock focbox fw which is 2.80. I would like to keep that fw since its setup how I want it.

Anyone know what happened to this tool or when can I get it?

Try calibrating your remote in the remote tab.

Make sure you do motor detection for both focboxes separately.

If still does not work pm me.
