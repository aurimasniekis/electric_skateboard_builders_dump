This was already posted in the Carvon thread, but thought this justified a new thread for discussion since it has been questioned and thought of by quite a few people.

Looks like @LEVer  may have figured out how to drive two wheels with one motor. Just can't figure out as of yet how he is doing it, and if it is truly 2wd off 1 motor. Would like to see video of him holding one wheel and powering the other, and vice versa. In the video we can see both wheels getting power and at the end he spins both wheels independently. 

Very interesting. Any thoughts on this? Reckon there is a clutch pack/limited slip set up hidden somewhere?

Not sure if it's truly solved but it sure looks cool as hell

It does use some of the qualities of a differential super elegant solution.

He might have sacrificed brakes and reverse in order to achieve that with some kind of "only driving in one way" stuff
The same way a bike works
(This is just and idea btw)

I don't think it would be good to have the exposed coils in the front. 

Wouldn't any road debris get forced inside the can?

Would be cool effect if the motor was sticking out the back.

Yes this set up has been proposed.  It would be awesome if it can work properly. Saves a vesc and you get power to both rear wheels.  The braking I assume would still be better than mono set up as more forced braking through both patches of wheels.  The belts would take a pounding though wouldnt it.  Meaning its questionable how long they would last.

Seems more like a clutch system instead of differential. And since they use it on their 4WD they can get away with no breaking since they could use the hub motors for braking

I do not think he is selling this as a truck only unit (just a guess)

I like the idea but needing hub motors for braking negates the gain you get by being able to run only one motor between 2 wheels. 4WD is total overkill for an esk8, unless it's an all terrain board.
IMO this would only be a game changer if it had brake functionality.

If he is using one way bearings on the small gear any time brakes are applied the motor would lock the bearings/gear which would make braking turn into sliding....could be fun, but not the gradual brake everyone is used to. This would make sense than that he is using one way bearings in the small pullies and why he is using this in a awd setup with hubs in the front, since he can use the hubs for braking and set up the rear to not have functional braking.

Was kind of hoping he may have found a way to make this work like a conventional differential, but it seems more than likely that he has just used one way bearings.

Here's one for the Carvon owners....


If you had the extra motor at the rear...and it did not have brakes...would the dual hub motors be able to slow you down enough?

Just as a guess....I would assume if the rear dual was just a pusher and coaster (I'm guessing) ...the dual motors would enough to stop you...


Ok GO!
-----

Edit Additional thoughts:

Hence my thought this will not be sold as a single unit...it must be paired with the regular Carvons...because these are not intended to stop you...Just push and coast

From Carvon Facebook:

_No LSD, but it has one-way bearings inside the motor pulleys, allowing for freewheel and the outside wheel to go faster than the inside for proper turning. That also means it can't brake. But the Dual Hub motors in front takes care of that. Basically, it provides torque at low speeds and disengages at higher speeds. It gives the board the torque needed to climb hills and coasting/top-speed of the hub motors._

I'm struggling to understand how this is better than a dual belt driven board. With dual hubs up front it wouldn't be lighter, unlikely to climb or stop better, I guess it could have a higher top end, but so what. Maybe I'm missing something...

Now that the capability to drive the wheels has been established, the next (equally important) question is how you stop them.

Based on the discussion and video, and to keep cost down, I think the simplest solution would be mechanical brakes.  If memory serves correctly, this is something that @Brakeboard proposed (for reference, I have not used his brake systems). 

Correct me if I am wrong, but if you have a system to apply mechanical brakes, this may in turn allow for a greater variety of speed controllers, potentially plane escs as they would theoretically not need to a braking function programmed in.

What do you guys think?  Food for thought...

I think we're trying to find ways to like this configuration even though it has obvious drawbacks. It doesn't really add anything useful IMO.
Mechanical brakes ? Too complicated.

I think that drive is meant to go with his complete build. 
Which will have two hub motors in the front.
The hub motors will handle braking, reverse, and speed while the belt drive will handle torque for hills.

I don't think this drive will be meant to to be used on it's own.

This is speculation on just the video and the teaser picture.

I looked at driving both rear wheels with a single SK3 6374 motor.  However, I ultimately came to the conclusion that you would need a differential since the wheels would be spinning at different rates during a turn.

The other possible solution would be to run a RKP style truck on a 0¬∞ baseplate in rear, such that the kingpin is vertical.  This truck would lean but not turn, so there would no longer be a need for a differential.  Low angle rear trucks are common in speedboarding since it makes the rear track the front, much like a race car.  (Rarely are they set at 0¬∞ though, usually more in the 15-30¬∞ range)
```

@jmasta If you pair them with a board that angles the rear trucks so that they are angled down to 0? 
http://landyachtz.com/boards/downhill-freeride-series/evo
Maybe something like this, landyachtz.com used to make one that was angled at 50 degrees at the back so 50 degree calibers would work.
```

---
## \#43 Posted by: jmasta Posted at: 2016-10-19T23:20:35.575Z Reads: 169

```
Yeah, are you talking about the Landyachtz R5?  It had a steep rear wedge, which allowed you to mount the rear truck backwards and it ended up at 0¬∞.  Very clever design.  That would definitely be a option, but I doubt you can get that board anymore.  The Evo is +15/-15, so you'd still need a 15¬∞ baseplate to fully level out the truck

Wedging to 0¬∞ would be extremely difficult with normal baseplates.  Even a 15¬∞ angle change usually necessitates drilling angled holes in the board.  

Your best bet would be a custom 0¬∞ plate.  At that angle the geometry becomes very simple, and it would be pretty easy to make on a manual mill.  I have seen companies sell these plates before, but they are definitely rare.  The other option would be an adjustable BP... most of the designs out there don't go to 0 though
```

Well, you don't really need to drill angled holes, all you need are two sets of holes on a custom angled riser, so you get straight holes from the deck to the riser and straight holes from the riser to the baseplate. This would be pretty easy to manufacture
```

Yea for sure, that would work. If you're going from 50¬∞ to 0¬∞, that'd be one giant wedge though!  I am pretty decent with a mill, and I still think a custom 0¬∞ plate would be easier to machine than the wedge.

Cindrich used to make 0¬∞ baseplates, but I have no idea if he's still in the game.  It was designed for Randals but would work with Caliber hangars

You know that even with a 0 degree baseplate the outside wheels still turn more than the inside wheels.
It doesnt solve the problem.

It depends on the truck geometry.  A 0¬∞ RKP truck with inline axles does not turn.  It only leans.

Yep, the outside wheel as to turn more because the radius of the turn is bigger on the outside. Im just wondering how much of a problem this is, since in cars a locked rear diff, while a bit annoying doesn't bring huge problems.

## \#50 Posted by: Michael319 Posted at: 2016-10-20T12:11:49.684Z Reads: 133

```
What I would assume would happen, is that when you take a turn at decent speed, you could lose traction in the back wheels creating some type of drift. But it would most likely be very uncontrollable. This is due to the fact that the longboard wheels have much less traction than something like a car tire. All terrain wheels could help to keep traction in the corners.
```

Also, a bad solution could to be completely lock the back trucks from angling. Like metal bushings, and get double cone bushings for the front. 

This still wouldn't fix the problem, but it could help slightly with losing traction.
