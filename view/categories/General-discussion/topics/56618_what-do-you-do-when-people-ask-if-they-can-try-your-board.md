If its a random person I would make an excuse like having to get home soon or the battery is running low, but if I know them I would always let them have a go

Depending on if I know that person, if I do then I‚Äôll tell them sure if they‚Äôll wear a helmet. If I don‚Äôt know them I‚Äôll just say next time maybe

No. Unless you sign my waiver and pay a fee, that is refundable after you return the board. Fee is $1600.

Lmao I let them try but I warn them that ‚Äúit‚Äôs really touchy.‚Äù Most people complain about remote sensitivity but it‚Äôs definitely calibrated correctly and I can ride on it just fine, I think people aren‚Äôt used to the instant torque of electric motors lol.

I say jst straight up, no. unless I know they ride board  . even if they do I make them wear helmet, and I have to know for sure they won't steal the board.

if they already own esk8, then I swap.

This is just a big no for me. I've let three guys I ride with all the time with similar power boards try it(Evo). Outside of them. Nope. 

If I ever had visitors I'd loan any of my other boards to go for a ride, except my Evo. The Evo is "mine" and I don't like it when other people's feet are on it.  Like full on dog like territorial.. that's "my spot" lol.

"You'd need a helmet"

"You have to be 16 years old with a driver license"

"I'm in a hurry"

(act like I don't hear them through my helmet)

"This one is too fast"

Oddly enough, these same people don't ask someone who pulls up in a Charger if they can drive their car around the block...

 Any rando or even acquaintances get an ‚ÄúAbsolutely not!‚Äù  I offer no explanations other than No!!! If it‚Äôs a close friend, i make them wear protection, put it on the slowest speed and tell them toplease be careful... real friends are careful with your things.... @b264  i had to use the same line on the guy.

I'm usually the one asking people if they want to try my board.

But, I suspect mine is a bit more manageable and underpowered than most peoples here.

probably not, board is to quick and quiet it feels smooth and before you know it your already going fast which leads people to loose balance because they don't realize there going fast already.  People were scared to ride my board but it was so smooth but went to fast before u know it is what I was told
I personally chilled at 30mph on my daily  route to school but i could cruise with everyone at 15mph -20mph and I lost little to no battery after 10 miles of the group ride I only lost 8%

I only let people I know and I know that they esk8 try my DIY board it has no slow mode so I'm afraid of people hurting them self. One of my first group rides one of the members decided to try my buddies nodded evolve and he ended up falling around 30mph with only a helmet for protection.  There was flesh streak marks on the asphalt..... 

Well that member is okay today and still rides with us but ever since that day I'm scared to lend my board out.

Now the my Raptor 2 im not as afraid to lend it out cause the throttle is alot smoother and I can control how powerful I want it with my vesc app

Only close friends or family, and for most I keep the remote and go running right next to them, I need to create a really chill mode for give it to people

The exception is my dad, he surfed the whole life and love the board

I have only let friends try out my board and probably never again.  Last guy bailed on my board and broke my mini remote (as well as got a nice scrape down his knee and forearm).  He wasn't going fast but he tried showing off...  I will likely just not bring it out among friends next time.

When random people ask, I will typically say sorry, I am not comfortable with other people riding something that aren't familiar with it.  That usually gets them off my back.

If I have my beginner (trainer) board and they have a helmet then I'll let them give it a go.

But on the 2 new ones no way, they are just too fast.

I usually ask if my friends want to try. I'll always change the settings to slow speed/acceleration, except on friends i know that can handle the board.
Random usually yells when i pass by, and i just ignore them.

What's with all suing things? :smile: If someone falls on your board, it's their fault.

I always let them, then i smack it into a low mode and let them go for a small ride few meters and back.

I even had a guy that got my phone number and used my spare board and we went out for a ride once, he got his own now without me he would never have gotten one.

I understand why people have reservations about letting people try their expensive stuff, it has merit.  

I let people try both my boards. After I give them some instruction on how to ride an electric version.  I always make them wear my helmet and I put the boards in slow mode.  Then they get the you ride this at your own risk speech. If I couldn't decrease the aggressiveness of the boards I would probably pick and choose who could ride.

I do value my boards, one expensive to build and days spent building.  But when someone gets back after riding and has this huge ear to ear smile that's more important to me.  I do the same thing with all my other toys.  Would I be disappointed if my board went speeding into a wall and smashed to bits? Absolutely.  But then after making sure dude is alright from crashing I'd take about five seconds of sadness followed by excitement because now I have a reason to build a better board.  It's just a wood plank with some go fast juice underneath.  I just want others to experience how awesome eskate is.

I forgot to say when I was waiting on my first eboard I researched the injury and death rates on all various eDevices - most serious ones were not the owners of the device it was people who were 'trying them' rather than owning them

Got a meepo V1 that I put in slowmode if friends wants to try it. 
My DIY board is pretty scary to ride due to the short wheelbase and that I like loose trucks so that will be a no if they are not esk8ers.

No randos. Only fam and close friends, and only if they either already skate or have some kind of snowboarding or other extreme sport experience and seem like the type. 

Usually i just say no. If they persist, i tell them they will die on my board, they can't handle it. 

I keep my trucks very loose and have spent years getting my ankles to let me go fast like that. ITs an awesome combo. Most people wobble out if they can even stand on it to begin with, though, so my board is literally a death trap for noobs.

I'll swap boards with an eskater on a trail in a heartbeat. At that point, its all like "woah bro let me check your shit out you from around here what are you doing in this thing what wheels are you using where did you get those mounts..." blah blah blah as we carve down the street on each other's boards. 

That's just networking.

I have a story.

When I first got my motorcycle (an air cooled standard, 750cc), I took it to an empty uarking lot to practice the drills from the motorcycle safety course.

There's this guy taking a walk with his baby daughter. He starts talking to me, "I used to ride", giving me tips, etc.

He gets around to asking if he can try the bike. ¬∞sure!¬∞ I say.

He hops on no helmet, then while I'm crapping myself, nails the throttle and books around the perimeter of the lot. Wtf... keeps his speed coming back to us, and slams the brakes an he gets to us jike stops rapidly them he tips over while still seated.

He gets up, picks the bike up, and says ¬∞See? No damage at all.¬∞

I'm kinda in shock staring at cracked half fairing, gashed turn signal, scratched engine cover. I have owned this bike about 24 hours at this point.

Somehow without speaking I convince myself that this nice guy with his daugter has taught me a valuable life lesson. I let him off the hook and rode away.

So yeah hard pass on the strangers asking to try. I don't lend my tools either, at least not the ones I want back.
