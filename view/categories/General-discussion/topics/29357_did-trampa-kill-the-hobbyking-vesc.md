Nobody sells vesc except trampa.

We have our own hardware that has been developed in house specifically for high performance esk8. 

It's called the FOCBOX http://www.enertionboards.com/vesc-x-speed-controller.html

It's a breach of VESC trademark

It should be stated here clearly Trampa is the only vendor to sell speed controllers name VESC. Everyone else makes a different name while referencing the design for the VESC.

Hobbyking didn't want to mess around with an OS Project, so they currently do a rebrand. That's the entire story. The also want to support Benjamin in future to keep things fair. 
We will see...
No reason for speculations. It won't be long until the product pops up again.

Ian and I had a very nice conversation. There is absolutely zero reason for stupid speculations.

I think the project is stronger and healthier than ever. Vesc-Tool is such a major improvement and public very soon.

Cheers, the walking dead.

this topic is walking a thin line.. if it gets out of hand I will close it.
there is no point arguing back and fourth about VESC its been done ad nauseum.
