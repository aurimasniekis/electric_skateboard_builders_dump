Fitted this Turbine to an EBoard....Eboard took up to 42kms then Jetfuel takes to 65+ more to come

have you considered incorporating a scramjet for hypersonic? obviously it‚Äôs useless below mach 2-3, but still...

```
on the serious side though, had you considered that above the no load speed of those electric motors they will be generating drag and possibly overheating or overvolting the ESC because the back emf voltage from the motors will be surpassing the battery voltage above no load speed. you can calculate the voltage that will be reverse charging your battery from:

motor rpm / kv = back emf voltage generated

if the back emf goes over 50-60v it could conceivably damage a controller. if the back emf goes above your pack voltage you‚Äôll be charging your battery with jet power.

the Turbine in Photo number 2  is a home built turbine and is 15kg thrust as apposed to the commercial Jetcat P60 that has 6.4kgs thrust

Thought the same thing. This is also how to burn up the DRV chip easily.

42kms
[/quote]

What [another e-skater trying to reach orbital velocity](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/build-for-a-5-year-old-kid/70075/4) which is only 9.4kms. Why you need to go to 42kms?

Your jet is cute but you may need something a bit bigger.

People these days just dont know when fast enough is fast enough!

If anyone needs to go this fast its @mars or @moon

Wow that's incredible ‚Ä¶.how long before there available?

Dam you can buy them now...

May I suggest most humbly as it was a bit hard to see.....so fast

Full leathers....+ a deck that's maybe not so flexible....could become unstable at 65 +  lol 

Well done

Some kindred spirit pioneers....nowhere near your level of sophistication @vanhaydn

Notice there rigid adherence to workplace health and safety regulations....
