Hi guys, 

So this week I‚Äôve developed abit of a habit to ride my Exway early in the morning and evening. I just got back from a + - 8km ride and I‚Äôve got 50% left on the board. 

Is it advisable to charge when lower than a certain percentage, in which case I can‚Äôt do the same range tomorrow, or am I able to charge it again now! 

I‚Äôm just thinking about the best way to ‚Äútreat‚Äù these batteries

Thought I‚Äôd share a pic of my board too üòÑ

Thank you again ![image|375x500](upload://xQGYxeePRlTxBIWDvhBnDbEzWwu.jpeg)

The best method of getting longetivity out of your pack is to only charge it to 90-95%. I don't think it matters at what percentage you start the charge. 

With that being said most batteries are rated for 250-300 full cycles. That's close to a year if you charge everyday. I just charge my batteries to 100% Everytime a year of use is more than enough for me. Plus I only charge every other day so I could get more use out of them.

word of advice.  When the battery says 50% you don't actually have half the range again.  You try that 8km ride again and you will be walking home.  Lipo don't mind being charged from 50%.

Do a range test on the thing to understand the absolute limits or you will suffer from dreaded range anxiety  :grimacing:

Absolutely, I never would do more than 10km at a time! So I‚Äôm effect, I theoretically should have at least 20-25% battery left including battery sag.
