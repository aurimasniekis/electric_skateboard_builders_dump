Hi everyone

We will make our first complete board with the parts we have been selling for a while now :slight_smile:

To get things started we will do a pre-sale with big discount for early bird buyers, it will be just enough to cover the costs at our end. :grimacing: 

The final retail price will be 1395.95 euro's, for the first 10 boards it will be 899.95 euro's. (estimated delivery end of April)

Specificatons of the board:

* Dual 6355 sensored motor's
* 10s3p battery pack samsung 30Q +-30km range (depending on riding style, weight, underground, ...)
* Orangatang caguama orange wheels
* E-caliber trucks
* Aluminum wheel pulleys 36T
* Dual VESC-based controller
* Maytech remote
* 2A charger
* Bamboo stiff deck
* 3mm ABS enclosure

Estimated range: 30km
Estimated top speed:: 40km/h

**Please note:** The deck you see on the picture is a prototype deck, final deck will have a slightly different shape and will be made from bamboo.
