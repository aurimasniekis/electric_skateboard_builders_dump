if you want stealth you want a esc that can run foc to remove sounds from motor

the diyeboard is not a VESC.  While it technically does FOC its not configurable and still makes a significant amount of noise.

If you prefer trigger style a simple mini RC remote wont let you down either.

The question not yet answered about the airless hub wheels is if the slow acceleration is because of the cheap ESC, or because of a motor limitation.

Obviously VESC has to be better than ESC, but I have not seen any tests showing how far you can push those hubs before overheating.

If you don't need more power, yes flipsky vesc will work.

motors can only run 30A each
so flipsky vesc 4.20 is a good option i think
unless people say it isnt good

Flipsky 4.2 dual is pretty new and only a few have used it. What i learned so far is it's not recommended for 12s. For 10s it seems fine. To my understanding either bldc or Foc works as long as it's 10s. But, more reports will be revealing. I have one on the groupbuy order exactly to mate with Skullboard hubs. I think  the amp ratings are generous for those hubs, but no one actually tried. So, we'll see. But if it works as well as focbox I can tell you  it's a nice ride with decent torque and and hill climbing. Power feels comparable to my boosted v2 dual +. Heat hasn't been a problem so far even during long hill climbs.
