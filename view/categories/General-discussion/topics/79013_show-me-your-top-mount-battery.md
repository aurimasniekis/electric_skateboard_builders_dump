Sooooo.... 
Got the hummie enclosure from @psychotiller for my eMTB. The thing is a piece of art. I had to change pants when I opened it. Unfortunately,  my planned deck is too concave to make it work, even with heavy gasket work. No big deal, I just bought a @hummie deck for a second street build because I wasn't pumped about using the pintail I got in my landyachtz box.

I'm officially going top mount on this eMTB now. Please, brothers, cheer me up with photos of your top mounted glory! Bonus points if you're using an MBS deck.

Alright alright this is what I'm talking about! So what's your recommendations for routing the wires? I see 2 typical setups; battery and vesc together or 2 separately. I want to go for one box since the unity is pretty small. Are you guys just making long ass motor to vesc wires and tying them to your bindings?

@Trdolan03 can you take some close ups of the top of your box and that solid cable braid you have?

What size pg plug is that main one?
What gauge wire are you guys using on your vesc /motor cables?
Is that cigarette lighter looking port (with the Keychain) your loopkey? 
Let me peep your insides? :face_with_monocle:

Fantastic work all around. This is wildly clean. Do you have a build thread? Creeped your profile and didn't see one. Also, congratulations! ![Screenshot_20181226-140737_Chrome|281x500](upload://9vRHFBM5FGGfkCmiezpIfrrI0B5.jpeg)

@venom121212 Haha. Thanks man. 
I used this port for the charger. I use a 12s 16a Charger so I needed something beefy. 
 CNLINKO 2 Pin Power Industrial... https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0795464LP?ref=yo_pop_ma_swf
14 gauge on the motor cables. 14 gauge on the charge cables and 10 for the battery cables. 
No loop key on here. Discharge 60a BMS with a eswitch. Cigarette lighter is a dual USB port. Also a usb on the inside with space to charge your phone in the waterproof case.

Here are a few pics of the inside. I can get better ones later today. 12s 8p 25r battery with NESE modules. Definitely don’t use 25r cells on any board. I have voltage sag to where the last 30% is unusable. Dual FOC Box. I have a massive 12v converter that I use for the USB ports and lights. Not the cleanest board on the inside but it works.

Man I'm feeling even better and better about the move to top mount now. The boxes are just made to be modded out. I have a davega kit in the mail somewhere so it'll look nice on top. I'm thinking I'm gonna skip the loopkey because Jeff from enertion says the focboxes built in antispark is plenty and I have the warranty in case. I definitely want to add some convenience factors as well. How tall is the tallest box that doesn't bother the inside of your legs? For reference I'm 5'10". I need to just practice with assorted cardboard box sizes.

Pelican 1200 case holding 3 4S LiPos wired in series.  There’s a lot of room left to possibly add 3 more LiPos in parallel. Case is attached to board with Velcro. 3D printer xt90s loopkey holder in top of box. I also have a step down converter mounted to underside of the lid and toggle switch top mounted for the 12v LED fog light. The pelican case length and width takes up all of the space between my feet. I wear a US 12.5 as reference. 

My FOCBoxes, remote receiver, and Bluetooth module are all in the Trampa Beast Box at rear of board. I hadn’t planned to set it up that way, but got a good deal on the Beast Box that I couldn’t pass up. Now that it’s setup I like having the additional room to expand my battery capacity if needed.

My esc's, anti spark switch and reciever sit in a small pelican case at the rear of the board next to the motors

I would just 3D print some covers and good.
For sure it wouldn’t look super clean, but for me it would be enough.
Honestly I also wouldn’t mind about the loopkey.
Nothing more reliable than a simple plug. Especially now in time of failing anti spark switches 😅
But yes it’s individual taste.

Did you see the battery boxes from @Riako ?
No of them would fit your needs?
How about 3D printing your own?

I felt the same way, to bulky and not square enough, not a clean enough look.. it will depend on your battery size and formation, but i just searched and search online for dustproof enclosures online. I knew my demensions and looked for internal dimension that would work for my battery. Amazon had this https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B07871XT6F?psc=1&ref=yo_pop_mb_pd_title for my 12s8p nese

If the 10s12p of @anorak234 is made with 30Q cells it means 36Ah or 1296Wh which is insane.

With my mountainboard I could ride for 73km or with Gummies 110km :smiling_face_with_three_hearts: that I would call a crazy range.

Thats awesome, glad to help. I mustve spent a month st8 actively searching for this box lol... few tips, always check "internal dimension" and look for a layout schematic or whatever its called(sometimes box design could interfere internally), if you cant find the right size try using different but similar words in the search and often i found completely diff options and sizes, and try seaching the actual dimensions you want and go up or down a bit to find dif things. Also try mm and inches. Best of luck

Damn this rounded enclosure is so beaútiful :heart_eyes: would like to touch it :laughing:

I think another important point in general is the weight of the battery. I'm also planning a 12s Li-ion between 5-7p but I'm not sure about the weight. I remember reading about people which didn't like the weight of a e.g 12s8p while riding on MTB. Would be interesting to hear some opinions about that. 

@anorak234 you battery must weight at least 7kg with enclosure, do you feel any disadvantage?

It’s definitely super heavy. I took it off road when I had mountain tires on it and it was noticeable.

It works for my needs though, I like long range carving  and so the weight isn’t a bother for my everyday ride. That being said, I put caster wheels on the back of the board and a handle on the front to move it because picking it up is a pain.

Personally i have to have an 8p pack bc i have to lol. Im big 6'5" 270lbs and in order for the ride to be enjoyable i draw a lot of amps. Which gives me less range and bc i have an 8p ive avoided alot of Volt sag. Its dang heavy, but i made a carry handle. I wish i could afford to have a smaller pack for a lighter board, i def see the advantages. But as i stated, im big so i can deal with the weight plus my carry handle. I can push in front or carry behind. I like the handle being on the motor end because theres no drag or noise when you carry ![20181227_105510|375x500](upload://nRGBms5ysPGPevJbARHVG8hJnTU.jpeg) ![20181006_133718|375x500](upload://9PkbnBECQUwf2Xmf81PFjpv8waa.jpeg)

I used just a old gigabit cable.

Internal dimensions of the Pelicase 1150 are about 210mm x 145mm x 89mm. You could fit a 12s7p with BMS on top. I chose 12s6p with BMS on the side with divider.

![190602|690x388](upload://j0vEuWcfJa2zK6xwJ9Cyb2TnJjB.jpeg) 

I prefer to have all electronics including anti-spark switch on the rear and only the battery in the middle. This way you can switch batterys or whole cases much easier. But both is OK. My first version had everything in a box in the middle with 85cm long phase- and sensorwires, worked well but was a mess.

The only downside is that all the heat of the vescs is trapped in the same enclosure as the battery in this case. On the other hand we do this with underboard enclosures as well.

With a small charge only BMS it should work.

An enclosure underneath the board is ok for all terrain or soft off-road like gravel or dirt paths but when going off-road you don't want the battery there. This is the bottom of my board, that explains it better :laughing:
