Hi everyone, I posted on here a while ago asking some noob questions I could have worked out through some more research. I've been reading up heaps and watching a lot of videos since then and have decided on all the parts I'm going to get, I would just like someone with a bit more experience to let me know if this is all good.

For esc, diy-electric-skateboard-kits-parts/vesc-the-best-electric-skateboard-esc/

For trucks/wheels/mount, diy-electric-skateboard-kits-parts/torqueboards-single-motor-mechanical-kit/?attribute_motor-mount-size=63mm+Motors&attribute_wheel-color=83mm+Clear+Blue&attribute_motor-mount-pulley=16T+HTD5+12mm+Motor+Pulley

For motor, https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-aerodrive-sk3-6364-245kv-brushless-outrunner-motor.html

For batteries, 2 of these in series https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-5000mah-3s-20c-lipo-pack.html

Antispark - going to make a key out of this https://hobbyking.com/en_us/xt90-s-anti-spark-connector-2pairs-bag.html

Rx/Tx, http://www.ebay.com.au/itm/FS-GT2B-2-4G-3CH-Radio-Model-Remote-Control-Transmitter-and-Receiver-WS-/222124756847?hash=item33b7aacf6f:g:2iEAAOSwgmJX04ia

Charging harness, https://hobbyking.com/en_us/twin-pack-charge-lead-2-x-3s-6s-w-xt60.html

To hook the batteries up to the vesc, I'm going to split those hxt plugs apart so I can plug the negative from one of them into the positive of the other, than just solder a xt90s to the other positive and negative wires, which connects to the vesc. Since I have a xt90s here, I don't need to make one of those xt90s keys everyone does, do I?

Another thing I've been thinking about a bit is whether to do the 245kv motor and 6s 5000mah battery, or use a 213kv motor with three 3s batterys in series, which would get me more torque, more speed and more range (I know it would still be 5000mah, but if i'm going same speed with each setup, the 9s one would get me slightly more range, wouldn't it?) which would only cost about $30 more. Although I wouldn't be riding in hilly areas, the increased torque would be good and so what speed and range, considering the low cost. Oh and i weigh about 90kg.

One last thing is, since that charging harness has the charge plug and the balance plug just from the 2 balance plugs, I could have a more permanent battery setup. As in, I could just have the xt90s connector between battery and vesc being accessible and then have the batteries always plugged into that harness, and just have the balance and charge plugs coming out of the enclosure, couldn't I?

Thanks for any advice, much appreciated

If you decide to do 9S you will need to figure out how you will be doing charging... Will you get a BMS?

Hey guys thanks for the replies. I've been really caught up with school lately and haven't been able to reply but I have been thinking about it a lot. I want to stick with the setup I described above but I'm really tempted to go with a 9s battery. I know it would be a bit inconvenient with charging, but I'm happy to charge the batteries separately - charge 2 of them in series as a 6s then charge the other 3s after. Depending on how these batteries go with the 245kv motor, I might leave it as 9s or buy another 3s and make a 6s2p pack. I was thinking about doing an 8s setup with 2 4s batteries or 2 3s batteries and a 2s battery but it does end up cheaper for me with 3 3s batteries.
Anyway, one thing I'm not completely sure about is when charging the 2 3s batteries as 1 6s battery, can I use this harness (https://hobbyking.com/en_us/twin-pack-charge-lead-2-x-3s-6s-w-xt60.html) and plug the xt60 plug from this into the charger? or should I just use the balance plugs adapter from that harness and plug the actual discharge plug from the batteries into the charger?
Thanks SyrusB for the advice, but since I live in Australia, I don't want to get my parts from all different people as it's a lot easier to just buy it as a package
