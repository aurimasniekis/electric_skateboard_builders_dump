I wanted to take the time today to give a shout out to Alien Power Systems. I blew my ESC that I had just bought from him because I didn't have my sensor wires plugged in. He offered to fix it for FREE. He then went the extra mile to install a capacitor bank that I purchased from him. To top it all off, he even shipped it via expidited shipping so I could get it back before I went on vacation with my board. If you are considering buying any of his products I would highly recommend it. His stuff easily competes with DIY's stuff but in terms of PR, he blows them out of the water. Not to mention that I had a PR disaster with DIY but even then he really goes the extra mile to make sure you are satisfied. And that is what I am dedicating this thread to, companies, mainly startups and small ones, that really go the extra mile and are a reliable choice for DIY builders like us.

I have experienced some troubles with the remote however. The trigger can actually get stuck in the full throttle position which actually cased by board to crash into a post and ended up causing close to $200 in damages. Bruno blamed me for all the damages claiming that I have modified the remote. Both my friend and I have had this problem without modifying the remote. I wasn´t seriously injured but it could have cause major injuries if it happened in a city. Also, my experience with his dual esc was problem strung with 3 separate failures. I can´t say that I have had a good experience with him...especially for the price of his stuff.
