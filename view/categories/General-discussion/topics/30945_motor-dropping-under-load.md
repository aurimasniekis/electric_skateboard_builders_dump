So I just finished building my first electric long board and I noticed when I went up hills or any rough road, my motor would slowly drop until it eventually met the road... I first used the cheapo blue loctite stuff and slowly worked my way all the way up to the strongest red loctite but with not significantly better results.. My motor drops in about half a mile on normal Los Angeles roads and sidewalks. I'm am somewhat baffled by why my motor drops under medium load. Any help is greatly appreciated!

be sure to let the loctite sit for at least 48 hours before using!! if you don't it won't be effective.

Threads have to be clean too. Putting loctite on dirty threads is practically useless. The cleaner they are, the more effective the bond is. It is why most people don't recommend gluing wood together if it is painted.
