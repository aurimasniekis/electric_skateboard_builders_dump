Pretty much every motor in the 200kv range on hobbyking has been on backorder for awhile. Has it been like this for a long time? Also, how often do they restock?

Not so often, like per two months sometimes quarterly. They just get out of stock very fast even after they restock them. I've got once the day when they restock, about 3 days later half of them were gone and within a week all goes back to back orders. Crazy

I ordered a motor about 2 weeks ago. It was on backorder at the time but now it is currently on its way to me.
