I would assume that its due to the fact that US has more stores, with better prices.

A motor decent motor can be 200 dollars at times over here in the EU, where same type would be just a 120 in the US.

Its a bit different from person to person, but  0 % to 59 % is around what we pay, i pay around 40% - 50% since i only earn just above the minimum amount a month to pay that.

I would most likely still have to pay import fees / duty, and i would loose good customer support.

I think its fine paying a bit more to know your in safe hands with local support.

Yep. Taxes in Denmark on personal income can as high as 65% depending on your income size... 
I guess that must be hard to believe for you 'Mericans? :D

I think we need another bms/charger group buy since they are hard to find here in the US. :us: Or just people loaded? :thinking: Heard rumor that Trump is going to increase tariff on metals, so we'll see about that.
