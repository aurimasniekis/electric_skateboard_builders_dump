Hi! I am in the process of building an electric skateboard. Don't think, build one and it will benefit you heaps with your last mile journeys. A DIY board will crush any pre-made board on the market. I look forward to seeing your build thread and helping you out!

Hey onloop mate ive been using previous a fiik street surfer lithium had for about 3 months now am riding an evolve carbon on street set up 

ok so the fiik had the battery life with the Lithium 12 Ah battery but i like the evolve street for carving and speed 

ultimately im wantinng to build a hybrid of these 2. I have also riden the fiik spine which was a dual motor setup not sure if its available to the public yet dan quinn owner of fiik lives around the corner from me  

so i want the dual motors, carvy like evolve, battery and off road of the street surfer

I have  been looking at alot of the enertion stuff i like it all but want more off raod AT OPTIONS! 

Any ideas and what batteries should i be looking at ive looked at hobby King and its all not making heaps of sense like enertion space cell is a 240 watt system but what is that in amp hours i understand that its a 10ps3 or similar i ride mainly flat nill hills rearly but alot of dirt tracks and paths road i just see stuff i wanna buy but wont to buy what works

There are few options for all terrain builds atm, We use to offer 5 inch all-terrain pneumatic wheels. But they sold out and i didnt restock because we are working on something new. Won't be available until next year.

At the moment the parts we sell are designed more for Street. Maybe do a custom bushing setup from riptide, then you can get a really turning feel from any trucks. 

Also Check out Alien drive system for their all terrain wheels.

Our battery is 270wh. Its basically 36v (nom) at 7.5ah

The beauty of DIY is if you can imagine it you can build it. 

Do plenty of reading first!

Enjoy the build as much as the ride.

Hello wonderfull people of e skate from Minnesota. My name is Hans Swanson and I'd like to say thank you. this forum is an exelent resourse and has taught me alot. I am in the process of building my first e skateboard and have sadly run into some issues. I bought an under capacity esc and because I already redid the wiring wasn't able to return it. 87 dollars down the drain. Being 15 years old with my only job mowing someones lawn was alot of money. Now I am using an alien twin esc and having issues. I think I am just going to return it and get the vesc because it looks sweet and have heard great things a bought it. When it's done I hope for the best. Sorry for going on and on. you guys and girls  have a great day. (Are their any girls on this forum?)

Hello Krudte here, 22 and I'm from denmark!
I plan to bulid a e-board, from what I've read so far I'm thinking Dual Rear motors and a longboard for the base. 
Completely green when it comes to both the electronics and the skatebording part, (I have never riden once before) e-boards seems like a bunch of fun and a great build project!
Much love to this site for being so informative, being the neewbie I am, all help is GREAT! :D

Hey,  don't worry about the skateboarding part. most of my mates had never stepped foot on a skateboard until I made them an electric. e boards are actually a lot easier to ride than a regular skate board. you don't have to kick or pivot which is the hard part of skating, and e boards also have brakes which skateboards don't.

Hi eBoarders,

Been lurking around this site for awhile, think it is time to say hello! 

My name is Pat and I got into eboards when trying to build my own version of an ESC at university.  After I finished designing and building it I found out that the VESC existed which was disappointing. If I summited the VESC I would of got the highest mark ever for that course!!

Now I'm up to my second build!

- Carbon Fibre Deck - enertion 
- VESC - enertion (waiting V4.10)
- Single R-spec 2.0 motor - enertion
- Single rear motor mount - 
- nunchuck remote

I'll post pics when I finish the build, just waiting on the VESC to arrive.

Welcome! Sounds like an epic build!

sorry everything is taking so long... im never going on holiday again! clearly nothing happens smoothly when you are not watching it for 3 weeks! :frowning:

Also, i don't think the DIY electric skateboard mount will work on the CF deck, you probably have to mount it backwards. It's a long mount.

No worries @onloop, no rush from this member.

I'll have to check the DIY mount. It's a older version where a steel mount is just welded to the truck. I used this in a diagonal setup for my old board.

I'll probably end up getting your mounts too @onloop, might be a christmas present for myself!

Hi everyone !

I m Baptiste, a french guy from Bordeaux and I'm very happy to join your community ! I am planning to build the following setup (which is very similar to Pato's) :
- deck : Arbor fish
- Single R-SPEC motor (Enertion)
- VESC 4.10 (Enertion)
- Enertion pro kit for single drive (Enertion)
- battery : 12S 5000mAh (hobbykinng)
- Power-Swich anti-spark (diyelectricskateboard)
- Wattmeter (ebay)
-  Nyko kama remote (ebay)

Now I am just waiting for the material to arrive in order to start this adventure :smile:. But until then I ll be reading your posts, they are full of awsome knowledges!

See ya !

PS : @Onloop don't worry holiday are essential to clean your head and keep doing good work !

love the arbor fish; I built a board on the timeless walnut, but ended up turning it back normal because it had a pretty significant amount of flex, and I was using a long non flexible battery... you will be fine though because your battery isn't as large as mine was. 

good luck with the build!
```

Thanks!
The timeless is also great ! I chose mine based on a guy's project on another forum who made a wonderful board. He delt with the non flexible battery by using Velcro fastening and apprently it kept the deck flex without any trouble. But I prefered the fish wich is shorter and easier to carry.

Hello all,
My name is Tom, I'm basically a 16 year old kid stuck in a 48 year old body.
I'm a long-time skateboarder, the first board I bought dates back to 1975.
I'm also an engineer by profession and I like to tinker with stuff.
And: I'm an RC-model enthusiast. 
So getting into DIY e-board seemed to be the next step: here I am.
My wife and kids think I've lost it.... :sunglasses:
I'm currently sitting on plans to build a dual-motor rear drive board. The deck will most likely be an old loaded Dervish, which has been my go-to board ever since it came out.
Ideally I'd like to be able to switch from road wheels to all-terrain wheels with minimal hassle.
I already have the R-spec motors and two VESC on order from Jason.
I'll be using the Nyko Kama nunchuck to control it.
Drive-train-wise I've not yet decided which path to take, but I'll keep you posted of any progress I make in a build thread which I'll create once my ideas crystallize.
Cheers, Tom.

Will get a build thread rolling soon!!

Hey all, name's Richard. After back to the future day I fell down the rabbit hole that is youtube and stumbled onto a video about Boosted, Yuneec, Marbel etc. Well now after a few days of forum reading I'm considering getting into this craze. I dabbled in 450 size helis, I've had a couple longboards, skateboards, snowboard, surf, windsurf, etc etc etc. I'm 6' 240lbs so I'm concerned about having enough motor/not getting crazy expensive. Fairly flat where I'm at but there are some slopes. 

So my hopes are to keep it as cost effective as possible while still being zippy enough, decent range, and so on. Leaning towards a kit with everything I need, is a 50mm 6s 5000mah single setup sound like it will be sufficient to start? Thanks in advance!

If you are going with a single motor maybe go with a 63mm. What's the speed you want to go? Zippy as in 16mph or zippy as in 30mph

I'm thinking of a 33" kick-tail for more maneuverability, so I think 30mph with that short of a wheelbase would be more terrifying than zippy. Range would be ideally close to 10 miles. Would the 50mm from DIYElectricSkateboard be too small?
```

---
## \#46 Posted by: cmatson Posted at: 2015-10-30T10:54:38.461Z Reads: 484

```
for your weight, I'd definitely steer clear of a small 50mm motor on a 6s setup; I just don't see that little guy pulling you around for very long before burning out.

If you can do it, higher voltage is always better; a 10s or 12s setup with enertion's 63mm 190kv motor, or any of the turnigy sk3 63mm motors would be **a lot** better.

I had a 50mm 6s setup when I first started, geared to around 22 miles per hour (it is also flat here in florida), but the difference is I only weigh like 140 pounds... even with my weight and gearing the motor ran really hot even though I wasn't pushing it hard: it didn't last me a full year either.

basically, I think by trying to go the cheaper route with the lower voltage, and smaller motor, you are going to end up screwing yourself over after burning out the motor

I'd look at the VESC esc (it's cheaper than alot of rc car escs too) and 170-220ish kv motors. I think a larger 63mm motor running at a higher voltage would make you significantly more happy in the long run.

good luck man! @saabsaviorlee

Hey everyone! I have always kind of wanted an electric longboard, and I finally decided to start planning my build. Basically, I'm going to take my current board, change the wheels out for some Orangatang Kegels, and add motors to both rear wheels.

My tentative build list is as follows:
Paris V2 trucks
Orangatang Kegel wheels
Alien Drive System motor mount kit, pulleys, and belts
Tacon Big Foot 110 295kv motors
VESCs for both motors
Either 12S worth of LiPos or a Space Cell, not sure which yet
Nyko Kama controller

I'm planning on building this some time in the next couple of months.

Hola gents,
I am a transplant from Alaska originally, now living in Spain building things and teaching stuff. I found ES.....got the bug and have been collecting parts ever since. My first build was a cheapo ebay special board, wheels/mounts/ trucks from enertion and motor/esc from DIY. Love it still it and use everyweekend. waiting from some parts (read Vesc and mounts) to complete next three builds - spanish Amano longboard, wolfshark, and Madrid double kicktail.

First post but long time lurker. 

Been skating for years and always wanted an electric skateboard. Pulled the trigger a few weeks ago on the Enertion R Spec motor and VESC (hope to get soon :-) ) Also got the Enertion motor mount. I plan on posting a build thread as soon as I get everything in.

Hi esk8 builders..

I'm from the Netherlands, and I have been on a evolution board in Spain, where I just asked the guy if I could have a go.
I have been skating since I was 10 years old. And after a pause of well over 20 years I started long boarding. And because I'm old now I need to nurture my "mid life crisis"? Pretty sure it's not that, but sounds cool!

The electric board I got on in Spain felt really natural, and within a minute I was whizzing though the streets, carving and going round the block.

I was sold, and after a lot of reading the forums ES and off course this forum, I decided that I'm in dear need of an e-board.

One of our users offers ( @chaka ) offers a fully constructed deck with 18650 batteries 12s and 2 VESC's. I decided that this would be perfect for me, I'm not a great hero with electronics, but I'm pretty confident in configuring stuff, and building the actual board.
I cannot recommend the board (yet) because it's being made, but I'm pretty confident that it's going to be AWSOME.

Propulsion is going to be 

-SK3 Turnigy 6374 192KV 2x
-Diagonal drive
Mounting and gears basically stuff the makes the board roll
-Caliber trucks
Mounts/gears still to be decided (maybe from enertion, but taxes are high here when importing from outside EU, I heard that @onloop is going to take care off that?)
-Abec 11 Flywheels 90mm 75a or equivalent.

After the build is ready, I'll make pictures and write a small review...

Hi all never really skated before but surf and snow board I work with electronics by trade and am a pretty avid DIYer so I though an eboard would be a fun project.  I have been working on an Electric longboard for the last month or so its up and running but need to do some fine tuning. I used a Turnigy SK3 213kv and FVT 120A Brushless Car ESCa 2.5 gear ratio and 97mm wheels currently am running 2 different battery setups. 2x 4500mah 3s Lipo and 2x 5500mah 3s lipo running them in series. Neither of the battery setups gives me the range I am looking for I get about 4 to 5 miles depending on the pack and usage. At the moment I have a cheap charger off amazon and feel that is part of my problem was also looking into changing my set up a little bit possibly going with a higher gear ratio and bump my battery voltage thinking that may increase my efficiency. Would love to gets some ideas on how to increase my range with out shelling out $200 or more for a 16000mah battery.

Hi, 
I am from okp forum (e-sk8.fr) that you may have already heard of. I have already mounted an electric skateboard with pneumatic wheels, even if some improvements may be done, but it runs :stuck_out_tongue: ! (I will post it latter)
In fact, I hope to set up a project based in the "Enertion Certified Eboard Builder" program, and spreading a little this transport means in my town. But if I have well understood, I have to build it with Enertion boards, so I am thinking about doing another one :blush:
Hope I could contribute to this forum !

Hello from Nashville, TN USA!
I've been interested in eboards but didn't want to just pay & ride. I'm one of those folks like to learn by DIY :smile:
As part of my work, I've been going to CES for the past 8 years and I've seen some last mile rides. When I met the folks from zboard & boosted board, I was tempted to just buy it. 
I used to ride skateboard as a kid, and at 37, I want to ride but with less work & more speed lol

If you guys have recommended parts list of sort, please let me know. I do have many questions so be patient with me :)

I've heard some people have not had a good experience at alien, but I've never shopped there, so I can't speak for myself. 

I'd say enertion and diyelectricskateboard are at the top for buying anything, and ollin boards is on the rise. Right now, you can only buy certain items at ollin boards, but one of them (the VESC) is cheaper and built to order more than either of the two competitors options.

Hi I'm broshi from Tokyo. 

Saw the boosted board and figured I could make that. 
Willing to spend $800+ but for the specs I want I'm willing to dish out more. 

【Desired specs】
・top speed 40km/h
・range of 30+km

It's a bit hilly around me so I'm considering a dual drive. 
I still don't know whether to get a hub motor or not, could you tell me what are the advantages/disadvantages? I don't want to deal with the hassle of carving my hub motors out after I wear down the wheels. Does one accelerate or use power more efficiently?

Also I have no idea how to solder or hook up a ESC to the circuit with the motors. I think my top speed and rage should lead me to which battery I should buy which will lead in me deciding which board can fit those batteries. 

Any help is greatly appreciated, first time DIY thanks!

Awesome. Where in Tokyo are you? I'm originally from Tokyo but live in Nashville, TN.

I'm making my shopping list for my first board as well. Right now, in trying to figure out if I can make removable battery system. When I'm in Tokyo, I'm in Shinagawa area so there are many hills. So, I was thinking instead of huge heavy battery, have one charging at the office and one at the house.

Hi guys, I guess I should introduce myself. My name is Luke. I'm a 22 year old competitive skateboarder, Computer Science major.

My interest in particular are short boards. I like the idea of compacting as much as possible into the smallest form factors possible.

I currently am using:
-30x9 inch board
-2 8000 mAh lipos in parallel from hobbyking
-the enertion drive tran and trucks and wheels
-r-spec II motor
-180a FVT ESC.

This is my second build, the first was the same parts, just with out proper housing. I carved my own wooden housing for the batteries and speed controller.

I use this board to commute 5 miles each way to my university. So a total of 10 miles daily. Currently, it takes about 25 minutes to get the 5 miles (would take about 20 minutes with a car + parking).

I'm excited to get my hands on a pair of the carvON hub motors, which I plan on using 2 VESCs with (I hope theres a chance of getting into the batch which is suppose to ship soon, I just ordered a second one today). These motors are capable of higher speeds then the r-spec, and thus, I'm hoping to cut my commute times down a bit.

I'm super excited for the VSECs. Seeing as writing software is what I'm good at, I hope to utilize the VESC to add head/brake lights, a battery meter, and a speedometer to my skateboard. Another possible feature I would like to add is build in USB ports to charge other electronics for the boards batteries, but that's the last one on my list so far.

Looking forward to seeing what you can bring to the community and enjoy for yourself of course! Sounds epic can't wait to see the build. Here are some USB charger adapters if you need them, or maybe you'll make your own! One is powered by discharge leads and one is powered by the balance cable.

@lox897 the second one you linked (that runs off the balancing port) apparently only drains cell 1 of your lipo, so it might not be the best option, lol. A couple people in the reviews were saying they destroyed their lipo's because of it. 

So personally I'd go with the one that converts an xt60 to 2 usb ports if I were you @evoheyax

## \#103 Posted by: evoheyax Posted at: 2015-12-09T06:16:07.193Z Reads: 285

depends on how big of a battery you use. the more mAh you have, the longer the range. I'm hoping with 2 8000 mAh batteries in parallel (meaning doubling the mAh), that I can get a range of 10 miles still. However, many factors are at play here:
- the power consumption of the motor
- how agressive you ride
 - and hills

there's more, but those are the ones I think of most off the top of my head.

I am using 1 r-spec motor right now from enertion, and 2x 6s 8000mAh batteries, and I get 15-20 mile range, Though I would recommend personally atleast 2 motors.

If you want to drive in a hilly environment you should take 10s and a dual setup with the hub motors. If you want to stay with 6s you should take a conventional setup (satellite configuration). 10s/7500mAh are giving me >30km reach on a CarvOn dual config in mostly flat environment.

What is the benefit to running at 10s instead of 6s with the carvons? other than an increase in max speed. If I can achieve he 35 mph spec with a 6s as listed (which as of Jan 1 2016 will be the speed limit on roads for electric skateboards here in cali), then why go up to 10s?

More power at startup and uphill, less heat on motors and electronics since less amps are drawn, more reach. Speed is not an issue, I already did >35mph with 7s which was ok for me and I still had a lot of reserve.

Ordered a Raptor Mono bout a week ago so pretty pumped to start hitting the streets with it.

I used to freeboard back in the day and that thing would always try and make me eat shit. Still was good fun, However could not ride flats and had to always walk up hills for another run. 

Anyway when I get the raptor I will be happy to share my experience with it with you all.

Hi, I'm JT!

I've been interested in the Electric Longboard community for months, and I've decided I want to build my own now (on a small budget hopefully)! I stumbled across this site whilst researching components for a build, and am amazed by the builds I've seen on here. 

I'd like to use the community's help in guiding me on what components to use, and with cinematography being my main hobby, I hope to document the construction of my first board through video for all to learn from!

Greetings everyone. So glad there is something like this to gather knowledge and bounce ideas off of in preparation of a build. I doubt there is anything unique in the way of design challenges that hasn't already been tackled her and elsewhere but if you'll pardon my current state of knowledge (or lack thereof) on most things e-board I'd like to pick your collective brains. So here goes. I'll admit from the outset that this first one may seem odd, but what is the best way to de-rate the motor/controller/drivetrain combination whereby the peak top speed is no more than 15mph but still have plenty of toque and range. This figure might even be a bit high, but as someone in their early 50's who has not been extremely active the last few years due to some physical limitations but is extremely interested in a build of this kind I don't foresee myself using something like this the way many of you here might. Say for instance carving or satisfying a need for speed so to say. Which means I would essentially be using an e-board for commuting. Probably no more than 12 - 15 miles a day. With that in mind I know there are going to be instances when I will be thrown "off-board", and I seriously doubt gracefully recovering from such an event on a board that is traveling in excess of 20mph would be healthy or wise for someone of my age and stature weighing in at close to 250lbs on a 6'2" frame. Probably not the physique that you would normally see on any board period. But I'm motivated and will not be detoured by my physical aloofness. Of course I will have an extensive array of safety gear, as I'm way beyond looking cool if that's at all possible at my age. So any advice on this subject would be greatly appreciated. And btw I have read all of the faq subjects but a lower top speed as a goal did not seem to be covered. Glad to be here.

Welcome @Monk!

I know there are a ton of us here who would love to help you build a board with your desired wishes. 

I recommend to start that you create your own build thread. Within it, say what kind of specs you are looking for (i.e. Range, speed, etc) and other things that might impact the parts we recommend (i.e. Weight, are there hills in your area, etc).  

Here's some starter info to consider: 
Motor KV varies directly with speed, so if you want less speed, you want less KV. Also, lower KV motors have more torque. 

Torque also increases at higher voltages. 

So for example, a common build is combining a 190kv motor with a 10s battery (the "s" stands for cells, so in this case, it is 10 cells. That makes roughly 42volts, as each cell is around 4.2 volts fully charged) this gives about a 25mph top speed though.... 

By switching the motor to a 149kv, we will be able to lower the top speed: also, limits can be put in the speed controller to make the board not so touchy. 

Looking forward to your build :smile:

Hello all! 

I have been dreaming about an e-board for quite some time. For some reason it didn't occur to me to build my own until I stumbled across a YouTube video.  Now I am still trying to decide on the components that I want to use. I have been doing a lot of research for months now and have it pretty well narrowed down but am still very open to about all my components. I do how ever intend to use an Arduino for my remote control. I plan on running a dual motor set up but with functionality of the arduino switching between one motor for endurance and two motors for power and hills. I have a long ways before I am ready to start my build but look forward to seeing all the other builds.

Cheers!

Hi

 new here as you can most likely tell, thought it was a good idea to stop lurking and join already.
so far i have had two boards, first caught fire and then i built a second.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlF6_yBwKm8

plan is just to have something to boot around base on

edit: basic member i can post more pics

first board

the most obvious way to limit the speed that I can think of is electronic. you can program the setting in the ESC to limit the speed.
that way it doesn't matter what motor / gearing combo you use, you can have the most torque and biggest motor possible for hills or whatever but still limit speed with the ESC.

Thanks to those of you who have welcomed me to this forum. I will take the advice given and start a new thread as soon as I figure out just how to do that as it's something I've actually never done before. Sad but true. I have been studiously compiling a list of design preferences as my research has progressed and there's really nothing of note that I haven't already seen successfully excecuted. No sense reinventing the wheel right? So I will look over my component wish list and post it for feedback. One thing I must admit I am curious about and clearly must be missing something on is why I haven't seen a bevel gear drivetrain arrangement with a drive bevel gear fastened in the same manner as the drive pulleys in a belt driven system. Surely this has been explored. I've seen plenty of bevel gears and pinion combinations of what would likely be very close to the ratios comparable to the belt drive systems so commonly employed. Maybe the flex in the trucks or some other reason makes tolerances more of an issue than the forgiveness of a belt driven system. Or maybe it's noisier. Or could it be that the pinion bevel gear would require the motor to be mounted so close to the truck hanger that it becomes impractical. No matter. Belts are our friends right? I have finalized my deck plan and am just about ready to move from concept to build. I will share more in a new thread but I'd like to thank you again for the warm welcome.

Richard from SW England – new to forum.
A friend showed me his electric skateboard about this time last year, a Boom Borda that he’d replaced motor batteries, ESC and remote on. Too much fun not to have one myself so found a bargain Boom Borda on Ebay, stuck on a 245kV motor (just 3 holes to drill on existing mount to make fit), 6S Lipos, 16T drive. Having read a little more about what’s what I now realise how fortunate I was that this set up worked so well given my ‘that should do the job’ shopping style.  
Push start, good speed and range – many happy miles and jaunts to the pub. The local council were even good enough to reward my construction efforts by building a new housing estate with a slalom road way.
I wasn’t happy having to push start, nor with the noise of the motor, so decided that more oomph was needed. My solution, step up to 10S with a new ESC. Having watched Benjamin Vedders video of a standing start on carpet – I ordered a VESC.
The chap that got me started knows a little about electronics, is great with a soldering iron and was happy to be tasked with fitting and setting up the VESC – he has now ordered one for himself.
Anyhow, long story short, 10S VESC 245kV – gentle smooth acceleration (no problem from standing start), just went faster and faster – until speed wobbles and major impact stopped play. Luckily other than a few cuts and grazes, an odd bit of bone sticking out and torn muscles in shoulder I was not overly damaged. Few lessons learnt, as you get older you heal slower and red lining on first outing is not a good idea.
After a little research I’ve realised there is a more to building an electric skateboard than bolting together some bits. The set up I’d created, on paper, had a top speed of just over 40mph, the VESC was set up to the motors rating which although stops the motor from burning out much reduced previous power.
Thanks to this forum and information shared I’ve hopefully learnt the error of my ways – 192kV arrived today and variety of pulleys by end of the week. I’ve a second deck so can re construct earlier set up and have time to experiment and learn the ways of the new. Also bought a helmet….
Thank you again for all the information and explanations
Richard

Overstated bone injury in last post – wasn’t sticking out literally, more a small bit of bone under the skin that shouldn’t have been there. 
Earlier crashes were not nearly as bad. Looking at my injury statistics the relationship between speed and harm is non-linear, stick in age coefficient and damage graph peaks hugely.
Torn and bruised muscles are going to take a fair while to heal, physio has been great and thermotherapy is just sitting in a whirlpool at the local SPA, there’s even a bar, so not all bad.
Pulleys arrived yesterday, will get on with converting other deck soon. 
It’s interesting looking at pictures and videos of projects – beautiful carbon fibre boards, precision engineering/machining and attention to detail is wonderful to behold. 
I’d like to show my next build but am a little worried it won’t be up to forum standard, although far from a botch they are not the most elegant or lightweight of builds – more a quick and easy convert of an existing product into something with grunt, speed and range suitable for the pathways and roads around me.

Hi, I first had the idea to strap my old rc car stuff to my long board about a year ago. I got sick of pushing myself for miles after my dogs got tired and stopped pulling me. A lot of research later and I found this amazing community. 
I just completed my first build and will post it soon. Details are: Ehlers 40" drop through, Carvon single hub, Mamba monster 2 esc, 2x 5000mah 3s in series, Quanum rx/tx. I have it all stuck to the bottom of the board with a @longhairedboy enclosure protecting it all. I have only taken it out twice so far since its 25 degrees out, and I couldn't wait to test it. 
Plans for the future will be more batteries and better rx/tx. 
Cheers! see you guys around

Adam from California here. Just placed my order for a raptor dual. Now for the tough part...waiting for it to arrive. Skated a bit as a kid, 20 year break, now skating again with my kids. Really excited about the eboards. Big reason I went with the raptor dual was the open source mindset and idea sharing that takes place on this forum and others like. I figured if something went wrong, I'd have a better shot at diagnosing and problem solving with known products like the exertion motors, space battery, vesc, etc than a mystery motor and electronics out of a Marbel board. Course the power and range of the raptor dual was pretty sexy too. Anyway, the plan is too get comfortable with my board then tackle a DIY board project with my son this summer.

ES-member here, decided to join esk8 as well. I am from Helsinki, Finland and really waiting for the winter to end!

My first build was Helectric-board, with Alien Drive Systems and Alien Power Systems-components. E-boards are really new thing in Finland so my board was featured in the biggest news paper in Finland :sunglasses: Check website for more http://www.pimio.fi/helectric/

My next build is going to be a real community built board. I have really small apartment, no skills other than solderin and no access to workshop so I have to rely on you guys :wink: 
 I have one vesc from @onloop, one  vesc from @chaka, dual hub motors from Lever (Carvon hub motors) and now im looking for 12S pack which I may buy from @torqueboards and then I need  enclosure that Im thinking of buying from @psychotiller or @RunPlayBack if they have something that could fit the huge 12S pack. 

Really looking for the year 2016 and all the progress that this community can make! Maybe we see E-boarding in next X-games? 

Cheers!

Hello from Washington, DC!  I'm in the middle of planning my first build.  Originally, I was looking at buying a commercially available board to help with my 2.5 mile commute to work, but after speaking to a co-worker who built his own board, he convinced me that it's completely doable.  After reading through the forums here and on endless-sphere for the past 2 months, now I'm at least equally motivated by building my board as I am about having a board to commute on.  I've already been dreaming up what my next build will be even though I haven't even started my first.

Here's an outline of what my current build will look like:

- Globe Maiden Deck. H/t to laurnts. I saw his build, and thought the deck was gorgeous.
- Enertion Space Cell (ordered)
- 2 VESCs w/ heatsinks from @chaka (ordered)
- [2 hub motors][1] from Hummie (ordered). Really looking forward to sharing how the motors work with everyone
- GT2B remote, put inside a bad wolf printed case (our library has public access to 3D printers)
- Trucks and wheels TBD.
- Enclosure TBD, but eyeing one of @psychotiller's enclosures. I saw [this one][2] posted. It looks like it's 475mm x146mm x 30mm -- just enough for a Space Cell and **maybe** 2 VESCs if they were rotated 90 degrees.

Looking forward to sharing and participating!

Welcome! 

I'm looking forward to seeing how hummie's hub motors turn out too- I've got a pair coming

For trucks, I'd talk to @Hummie because I know some trucks need modification to work with his hub motors. It just comes down to how much threading is on the hanger.  

The space cell and VESC is a really solid combo as well :smile: ;especially with one of @psychotiller or @RunPlayBack's enclosures. They are both vacuum formed ABS.

Thanks for the warm welcome, guys!

@psychotiller, yes, I'd definitely be interested.  The parts going into the enclosure would be the Space Cell and 2 VESCs.  Do you know the original intent of the enclosure?

From what I know of the size of the VESCs, it seems that I might be able to put them side-by-side, width-wise, right next to the Space Cell.  That would be 380mm for the Space Cell and 80mm for the two VESCs.  That's 440mm, leaving about 15mm of play... not a lot it play it would seem. :smile: 

My VESCs and Space Cell haven't arrived yet, so I can't confirm that my estimates are correct.  If the original intent wasn't for a Space Cell and 2 VESCs, I might just wait until I receive my parts so that I can mock how much space I need inside.

This is the best one for what you are trying to do:
http://www.ebay.com/itm/172093580772?ssPageName=STRK:MESELX:IT&_trksid=p3984.m1555.l2649

It perfectly houses the space cell and two vesc's with their capacitors layed out in line with the battery. The shape on the ends gives you plenty of space to put switches, charge plugs, voltage monitorsor what ever else you come up with.

Short answer... it is an experiment in high speed stability. 
The hub motor board I built felt more stable the faster you went and with the larger pneumatic wheels, most pot holes, streetcar tracks and grass/gravel were a non issue.

Hello! I've been interested in electric skateboards since I first read about them around 2 or 3 years ago but they're not cheap which has meant that, until recently, I simply couldn't afford one. Now that I can, I'm carefully weighing up my options. All of the "out-of-the-box" products I've looked into so far are either not powerful enough to carry me, too bulky, or made overseas which means I will have to pay extra for shipping/import duty etc. Living in England also means lots of rain, which most boards don't seem able to cope with very well. Self-building may be the way forward for me, or perhaps not. I'm here to find out.

Yeah, still around - had just to remember which one I posted here. :smile: It's a very simple box actually, it's made with 5 layers of glass filament (160g) and epoxy (colored black). 

Take the measurement you require (and cut the glass filament +2cm), construct a carton box, fix the box to the deck, cover the box and the surroundings of it with adhesive film, paint it with a wax substance (don't know that term in English), apply epoxy, first layer of glass filament, epoxy again and so on. Let it dry for 24h, take it off and cut the edges, drill some holes and that's it. :)

Sounds cool, and I think that glass filament is exactly what I've been looking for, I'm definitely going to work on that and will post some pics when done. Should work better than lunch boxes from Ikea :stuck_out_tongue: 

I just have one problem though, I have no idea what "glass filament" is and where to get it. Google isn't really helping (unless glass filament is some kind of adhesive.. wait.. is it?). If you know where to get it, could you drop off a purchase link? :smiley:

Thank you for creating this awesome spot. Really appreciate the knowledge base you guys have collected here.

Im from San Jose Ca. I am 29 working for the tech industry. I have no riding experience and recently took up KiteSurfing. I realized i needed to work on my board skills and thus decided to pick up longboarding. Browsing the web led me to discover electric skateboard, i wasnt really impressed by the commercial options such as the boosted boards (low range) and thought there must be better options available, which led me to this forum. I am glad to be here and attempting my first DIY skateboard.

I have a Sector 9 Budro 38 that i plan on turning into an electric skateboard. The main challenges and goals id like to achieve with my build are as follows: 

1) I am 210lbs and would probably have a backpack on with a laptop so Im on the heavier side
2) I will be mainly using this board as a commuter board and would ideally like around 18miles+/29km+ range per charge
3) My commute does not have huge hills, maybe 20% of the distance i travel has 20% incline.
4) Having the ability to go 20mph/45kmh would be awsome
5) I would like to keep the cost sub 1000 USD. My reasoning for this is that the Evolve bamboo street board that has very similar specs costs around 1000USD at the moment. I am currently fighting the temptation to buy that because a part of me also wants to do this on my own, learn and be able to eventually contribute, but i need to justify that and cost seems to be the likely place to target. I read @onloop 's excellent post on false economy and im trying not to fall into that trap. I wonder if my logic is fair here. 

So thats what im going for. Some of my favorite builds on this forum have been 
@RunPlayBack 's builds with the CarvOn Hub Motors.  
@treenutter 's The Village Build.
@laurnts 's LACR Build

Props Guys. Very professional looking builds.

My current plan of attack has been to go for a Single Drive since its cheaper and itll be easier to fall into my budget range with this.

I was looking at the CarvOn Hub Single Drive Motor since its at a reasonable price. However the comment regarding 220lbs being the limit gives me reason for concern and pause. Since i am 210lbs with a backpack and i would like to be able to go up a 20% incline i wonder if i will be stressing the motor for this drive.

Then the other option now is the Enertion Motor Kits. Slightly more pricier than the CarvOn but no info regarding the weight limit. I am eyeing the r-spec pro with the 6355 motor since its cheap but worry about weight limitations again so then looking at the pro+ which is more expensive but with the 6374.

So current pick of the motor is
http://www.enertionboards.com/diy-electric-skateboard-kits/single-motor-mount-pro-kit-plus/

Price: USD404

For the battery the 10s SpaceCell from Enertion looks dope, Low profile and includes the battery management circuitry and has a display.
http://www.enertionboards.com/electric-skateboard-parts/space-cell-pro3-electric-skateboard-battery/
Price: USD345

For the VESC i was looking at the Vedder VESC's
http://www.ollinboardcompany.com/product/vedder-s-speed-controller
Price: USD165
But i guess i could cut price by getting the VESC from Enertion too which currently costs USD104. Not sure what the tradeoff's are. So would appreciate the input :smile:

As for the controller i was thinking of getting the one from TorqueBoard for USD50
product/torqueboards-2-4ghz-mini-remote-controller/

Not counting the enclosure, the total price comes up to around USD903, which is awfully close to the Evolve Bamboo Series boards. Maybe i do not have enough knowledge yet as to what i am giving up/gaining by either option.

Also, im sure i could optimize my current build a lot more to get the performance i need and i might be going overkill with my choices. I just dont have the knowledge base yet to know where i can focus on to optimize.

Your help is greatly appreciated :)

Welcome to the group! Well I could help shed some light over carvon or enertion kit. I believe you're weight is quite common so it should be okay with any of your selection. However how about terrain wise? Many hills? Big hills or small hills that does matter. You cant go wrong with satelite configuration (belt wheels etc) as they are proven many times with many builds works successfully. However if you dare to try, hub motor is sleeker and easier to build. Personally I am building new one with dual hub motor as I dont trust single hub motor torque.

@laurnts Thanks for the reply!

Not many hills. Most of the usage is going to be on flat land. I will be traveling 6 miles each way and i think theres only a few spots where there is 20% incline. Mostly to get out of bike/skatetrail that runs underneath the highway to get to work.

[/quote]

So does this mean that the single hub motor wont have enough torque to propel a 210lb guy with a backpack up 25% incline? Would you recommend going dual if going hub configuration?

I recall in your build you used an Enertion Single Motor Build but planned on using CarvOn duals. How did that go?

I'm thinking at least a 63mm motor with 8s or 10s at least....if you are gonna use one motor....a two motor set up is best for hilly rides.....less chance of burning out a motor with two motor set up and more traction to keep the momentum going on a long stretch or steep incline ..... Plus on the way back down hill.... A more solid base if you aren't bombing the hill and trying to stay in control on the way down .... Just my two cents

Might want to also look into the 12mm or 15mm belt/pulley options for single motor + hills, to decrease chances of belt slippage. At least that's what I've heard around the forum boards.

To be honest I don't have Carvon Hub Motor tested yet, but if you ever test the torque of these brushless outrunner for the first time you will be surprised. I believe you can go with single motor belt - wheels setup. As long as you don't start from static, I suppose 20% hill grade shouldn't be an issue. The best part of motor belt - wheels set (satelite configuration) is that if you ever feel the need of more torque, you can add another motor, esc, mount kit at ease.

You really should take into account the 20% hill grade. Sometimes the problem is not the 20% degree of incline, but how long do you need to climb that hill, do you start by climbing hill and does the wheels have enough traction to do 20% hill.

My board could carry my 60kg weight to about 30% incline, however the chances are that the wheels will slip time to time when I make turn during climbing. I found that loose of traction inconvenience and dangerous. Braking downhill with single motor also seems to put alot of stress to the motor, mount kit, belt and wheels.

Hello Everyone,
My name is Tim, and am currently a master in a lot of different fields, electronical engineering (specializing in robotics and microcontrollers), mechanical engineering, fabrication (from metal working to wood working), and many other topics.
I currently am interested in building an electric skateboard because I plan on moving to Chicago fairly soon (because college); and want an electric skateboard as a means of transportation around the city.
This will be my second board, however my first was a completely overpowered mountain board, and would like to make this board more practical.
So the current setup I am looking at was...
-2 4s 10000mAh lipos in series
-a single turnigy sk3 63xx motor (unsure which size to use at this point)
-a VESC
-and a custom controller designed around the arduino platform

The only thing I am currently unsure about is the proper gear ratio and what way is best/cheapest for mounting the motor. If anyone has any insight on either the setup or mounting the motor any assistance would be greatly appreciated.

Welcome @deadlyrobot310.  @barajabali and I are also from the Chicago area.  Maybe we could set up a group ride once you have your e-board finished.  Not sure how much you weigh, but If you're running a single motor setup, I'd go with an sk3 192kv 6374.  Unfortunately they're out of stock in all of HK's warehouses.  The Tacon Big Foot 160 245kv 6364 is also a good choice.  It's a bit smaller, but people on the forum have mentioned they have more torque than the sk3's, and also the kv rating is more appropriate for 8s. For the gear ratio, people tend to go from a 36:12 to a 36:16.  36:12 having more torque with a lower top speed and less teeth being meshed into the motor pulley, and 36:16 being lower torque with a higher top speed.

I think it really depends on your weight especially on a single drive, but I probably wouldn't go down to 36:12 since there isn't enough teeth being meshed into the motor pulley resulting in skipping.   [B & B Manufacturing's Belt Length Calculator][1] recommends have no less than a 36:15 ratio because they say having less than 6 teeth in mesh with the smaller pulley isn't suitable for most applications, but I've ridden a 36:14 from Enertion, and it was fine.

Hi,
Ben here from the UK.
Just bought a knackered eight ball carver. There were quite a few broken connections so re soldered these and then discovered the batteries were shot. Ive replaced these with hobby king 3 cell 5000mah 20c batteries and it seems like it is ready to go. Zipping up and down the lounge while i wait for the weather to break..
Now stumbled upon this site and others and seen that what I have now is rather clunky so going to lurk and look into build something a little more streamlined...
Cheers

Also I would like to be able to hit around 25 mph as a top speed. If I need to get a more powerful motor or even jump up to a 10s or 12s setup I will. I am a bit on the heavy side and want to make sure I will have enough torque but still hit those speeds.

Hi everyone!

I'm in college and I currently bike everywhere. It gets pretty tiring if I want to go home then go back to campus for the gym. So I'm now reading all I can about electric skateboards! I was originally just going to buy a Yuneec E-GO, but the speed limitation and weak motor worries me.

Most of my town is flat, but there is this one S-curve slope that is kind of steep. I'm mainly looking to build a commuting board with a range of at least 20 miles and top speed of 15-20mph. I weight about 150 pounds and want to keep my budget under $1000, but ideally around $700 or less. Has anyone built a board with these specs in mind already?

Yes its totally possible with that budget, even better if you already have a longboard your self to begin with. 20 miles is not that long and 20mph is not fast to most people here while 150pounds is not considered to be heavy. So if you ask possible or not, it's very much possible.

20mph speed = 6s  - 10s battery build
20miles = 10AH on 6s and about 10s 8AH - 10AH (enertion space cell would cover both speed and distance)
Use single mount motor build, SK3 motor or RSpec motor or any motor 250kv or lower

Hi All, Just getting into Electric skateboard building. I'm 48 years old and I've always wanted one since being a kid and now the technology is available to do this quite easily and cheaply.
I started off by buying a cheap faulty 12v dc motor type electric skateboard as the mechanics were already done for me and I could concentrate on the electronics (my main skill). Stripped it all down and was surprised to see that the motor was relay controlled so the motor was either off, on or brake. Stuck in a 4S Lipo battery pack and had fun with it, but now I want to go faster and use it for getting to and from work. So now I am investing in a brushless motor (or two). Already made plenty of mistakes like buying the wrong type of ESC (for a plane not car) so still learning. Having fun though.

U need the correct type of charger for the type of battery you use

So you can't charge a 18650 battery with a regular charger...or a lipo ... Need specific type

If you use lipo, you need balance charger and a power supply for that balance charger. There are some balance charger that does include the power supply (watch for the balance charge specification if is it 110v / 220v or 12v - 25v). If the voltage is 110 / 220v AC means it includes power supply. If the inout says 12v - 25v DC means it needs power supply.

If you use 18650 packs which I dont think you gona use, it requires BMS (battery management system) and a power supply.

And there is my second mistake. Brushless motors are a lot harder to come by than I thought. Bought a GT5335 200kv that seems to be powerful enough, but I'm only running it at 4s 13.8v and its spec'd for 10s.  So with the gearing I already had with the board, this resulted in a <8mph . so I bought a n5055 580kv motor and reduced the drive pulley to gear it right down. Jus waiting on a pulley belt before I can try it.

a regular lipo charger should have settings to charge liion/18650 but wont come with an adaptor.

Hello members, first post is about me: middle-aged male, long time ES and ESK8 forum lurker, based in Zurich, Switzerland. A long time focus was restoring and riding my vintage Harley. This got a little boring and time consuming, so back to board sports and MTB riding. Couldn’t resist and built two eBikes … learned a lot. 

And I’ve always been interested in everything related to boards and / or water in any form. So when I saw one of the first commercial electric board at Freestyle.ch I was immediately hooked! Just buying a board was out of the question, only way to go is DYI. But first I had to finish my drone (Immersion RC Xu-Gong  II pro), cure some injuries and do some research. 

My builds: 
TF4M – idea was to do an initial rough build, learn, be up and running quickly, then do an improved build. Out came “Too Fast 4 Me” (TF4M). 12s, single sk3 6364 

Next build is going to be nice

Thanks to all for sharing your great wisdom

Hi people, 
I've been creeping around the forums for a while and think im gonna take on building my first e-board. I have a lipo charger and RC knowledge but am new to the long boarding department. I live in Illinois right now but Im going to San Francisco over the summer for an internship and want a e-board for transportation. 

Heres the plan, LMK if anything raises any red flags.

-Homemade 4 ply, 1/8" Baltic Birch drop-through deck, 38"
-Paris V2 trucks
-83mm wheels
-FVT120a ESC  (Still looking for a used one)
-Wiiciever 
-Single 63mm motor  (Still looking for a used Tacon... or any really)
-6S (5000-7000mah) 
-Attemping a homemade motor mount. 
-Gearing will depend on motor, 12mm Belt (also looking for any used pulley parts!)

Trying to go cheap as possible but with still buying (used) decent parts.

Where do you find these aluminum 36T wheel pulleys? Ebay?

So far I've found this forum very helpful.

Doing 3 wheeler has crossed my mind on several occasions. The drive wheel and motor assembly is much easier to design as it can just be mounted direct onto the board and never needs to move. Then all the steering is done at the front. Nice one.

Most the mounts ive found are for Caliber trucks it seems like and I want to run Paris trucks.

 A drive kit and motor mount from enertion is about $110 after shipping. Making a mount for $10 and paying $25 for pulleys and a belt is a more cost-effective solution for me being a broke college student.

You can find cheap replacement motor of the same size and cheap on eBay ..... I use them one boards I know won't get worked like I ride mine... You will see that some of the most popular at the SK motors and tacon .... And the way things are going 63mm motors are the can of choice....
All I can say is always be on the look out for the motor you want...and maybe just buy it when you see it....cause it maybe a loooooong wait before you can get it again...I've been on the hunt for a sk 192kv but no luck ...I caught a sale in the sk 149kv...but I will need to run that at 12s to get me the top speed I want with that motor

Whats up eSk8 builders!

I'm mike, building my board to get around west LA where the hills are forgiving and the bike lanes are abundant. 

So basically I'd like to be able to pick between going 20 miles @ 12mph or less miles at a greater speed. I've got all of my parts picked out except for my batteries, which I might pull the trigger on this week. They're 2x 6s 30c 8000mah Zippy LiPos, hopefully this gets me where I need to be.

Its mostly for low rpm smoothness, but I agree that for the most part it isn't need in the case of E-boards. There's always enough load on the motor to keep it from running spastic at low rpm. Mostly used in RC where the power-to-weight is much, much higher.

hi im a brand new member, i have been skating for almost 12 years on and off i wanted to build my own eskate when i saw a youtube vid of someone that did the same i need some help with my build i need to be pointed in the right direction 

im trying to build an a cheap board with minimal fab work and that will be reliable and possibly upgradable that can haul my 250lb butt around i want to go 25mph max and it isnt a must. 

 My first question is do you guys think this combo of mech  parts will work for a single or dual drive system without any modification

Enertion motor mounts
http://www.enertionboards.com/electric-skateboard-parts/carbon-fiber-motor-mount-enertion/

enertion pulley kit
http://www.enertionboards.com/electric-skateboard-parts/12mm-wide-pulley-drive-hub-kit/

diyskateboards trucks 


ebay knock off wheels with rims in them 

I think that i will get the VESC from either diyelectricskateboard or from enertion not sure yet

can you guys recommend the following

decent size cheap lipo batteries

and also what motor to use keep in mind im a heavy guy and would want it to be a bit torquey and not necesarily very fast but 25mph would be nice and i would prefer something reliable

any help is appreciated

Hey guys! 

I'm a current college student at UC Berkeley, and I've used my trusty skateboard to get around the hilly campus since August. But I want to turn my skateboard into an epic hill-eating machine over the summer. Of course, I'd prefer doing it the cheapest way possible, but I'm not afraid of spending a little more money in order to improve the quality of the build or the performance of the board. I'm hoping to get the board to around 40 km/h, and I've read a lot of threads on this website and watched a lot of videos online about how to do this. Should I start a new thread asking specific questions about my build or can I just ask the questions on this thread?

Can't wait to make this thing SHRED!

Hi everyone, my name is Dylan and I've been long boarding for 15 years!  Both competitively and as my primary form of transportation.  My main reason for joining the forum is solely to build my own electric board.  I bought a BB Dual + and fell in love, but the range and size of the board was saddening, inspiring me to turn my 10 year old S9 Luke Nosewalker into a long range commuter machine!  My only real wants are at least 20 miles per hour top speed and 20 miles of range with no concern over the weight, with the intention of being able to add upwards of 50-60 extra pounds of carry-on luggage on top of my own weight of 145lb.  Can anyone point me in the right direction?  Just a place to start would be more than appreciated!

Hello, my name is Matt. I've built 2 homemade longboards and am currently in the development of building my first electric longboard! My plan is to copy the Boosted Board design with the same Orangatang wheels and board design. I want my board to be sleek and thin so I'm wiring 6 2S Lipos in series for a 12S board. This site introduced me to VESC's and thankfully so. I'm using some of the gear and power calculators to fine tune my gear's right now. My biggest worry is attaching the wheel pulley to the wheel. I want everything to be perfect and I worry if the gear is not perfectly centered problems could arise... Any tips on how to make sure my gear is centered? And if anyone finds any flaws in my current plan please tell me! 
Thanks for your input

So recently I was planning on creating a 12s battery pack using 3s 5000mah batteries with a bms. 
Here is the batteries I am using http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/uh_viewitem.asp?idproduct=8579&aff=1086883.
Additionally here is the bms which is compatable with lipo batteries.
http://www.batterysupports.com/44v-48v-504v-12s-30a-12x-36v-lithium-ion-lipolymer-battery-bms-p-268.html

I have already purchased my the batteries but am confused as to how I would wire the balance wires connected to each battery to the bms. Currently I have been just using a 6s setup with a balance charger but want to upgrade to this new battery. I haven't seen any posts or videos similar to a battery that I am making because I am using premade batteries. Any help as to how I would wire this bms to multiple premade lipo batteries would greatly be appreciated. Thanks!!

The main reason I am confused is because of the lipo's batteries 4 wires in the balance connect as you can see from this image.

I have what I extra wire is doing. Again I would appreciate if someone who knows more about lipo batteries could give some input.

EDIT: I actually just found out what each wire does. According to this post http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/12s-battery-configuration-question/3088/20?u=jrpwit there would be 1 power wire and 3 grounding wires for a 3s battery but I am still confused as to how I would connect this to an bms since I am connecting multiple batteries.

The 4 wires form what is called a balance plug. It is used to charge the battery while also balancing each cell to prevent damage. Each cell has a wire connected to its positive and negative terminal, and to conserve wire each cell shares a wire<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/7/7cdcae88440b82d3db95042be0235b0f4f29c28b.jpg" width="640" height="480">
The positive and negative OUT wires in this picture are the black and red wire in your picture. The other colorful wires form the balance plug, and you can see how it is laid out with 4 wires.

In terms of wiring a BMS, I am not 100% sure. From what I've learned so far, a BMS is wired in parallel with each cell exactly like the balance wires.<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/4/4290a5ab97f89bf5c639166464908ee86baa57aa.jpg" width="300" height="181">
If you can imagine the yellow batteries in this picture as your cells, and the board being your BMS, you could splice your balance wires and directly solder in the BMS. The 4 balance wires would be soldered to the 4 connection points on the BMS board and the + and - power leads on they're connection points. And if I'm not mistaken, the BMS board should act as a balancer not requiring the need for a balance plug.

Hope this helps! If anyone notices a mistake or wants to add on, please do so!

-Matt

Omg DUDE thank you for the diagram of the 3s lipos!!!! I can not thank you enough! I think I can take it from here and hook up my batteries to my Bms. I will add that my bms is very much different than the one you showed by with the lipo diagram I can figure it out from here. Again THANK YOU!!!! :slight_smile:

Hello, I'm Paul. I built my first electric longboard a few months ago. I built it without making a lot of research before so there are probably a few unoptimized things on my board. But hey, it works, I have a good max speed (enough for my at least ~ 35kmh), good range (~13km) (I am a very light person).
I just discovered the huge electric skateboard community!

(I made my board myself out of a piece of wood...)
I've built a Bluetooth speaker into my board ;) (mainly for use when not riding the board)

Hey all, I'm Rob! I've been lurking for about a month now. I'm looking at building an electric longboard, and maybe a electric mountain board later on. I've just been doing a lot of reading and researching until now.

I'm an engineering student and I love just fiddling with stuff, so I'm hoping to do as much as possible on my own. Being a current student I also have access to a lot of tools and machinery that I wouldn't have otherwise, so I think I actually can do a lot of my own.

Anyways, I'm hoping to building something I can have some fun with and possibly use as a commuter board (bike recently got stolen :frowning:) I'm probably going to do a dual setup for the torque so I can up a few hills close by, and for the acceleration :smile:

Parts list so far 
-Deck: I'd like a Loaded Vanguard or Dervish, but for cost I may end up buying a homemade deck from a friend of mine.

-Trucks: Caliber II 44, 10", probably in green or blue

-Wheels: Flywheels, probably clones. Also, green or blue

-Motor Mount: I've started designing my own based off of a mix of @psychotiller's mount and @onloop's free plans. Gonna buy some aluminum and machine it myself (well probably water jet)

-ESC: VESC. Buy the parts and solder it myself.

-Motors: @torqueboards's or @onloop's 6355. Unless I can find an Aerodrive. Still somewhat undecided but leaning towards torqueboard’s, definitely looking for input on that.

-Batteries: 18650s pack. Also, buy the parts and solder it myself. Still deciding between 12s4p, 12s3p, 10s4p and 10s3p.

Hi, my name is Ricardo. I've been doing research for a while about e-boards and I'm already getting the parts to build my first one. I'm studying medicine, so I lack some engineering knowledge, which I'm rapdily getting mainly from this forum. Once I figure out how to create a new thread, I will explain the ideas I have for my build (some of which I haven't seen before :P). I hope I can learn a lot of new stuff from you guys.

(Yes, I have read the tutorial to create a new thread but it seems like the "New Topic" button doesn't want to appear on my browser)

Hey guys, I'm from South Africa - beautiful country but far from all of you as well as parts :slight_smile:

I'm still figuring out the best way to get good quality affordable parts for my build. I got in contact with a guy here in South Africa that sells eboards for a great price, but I'm not sure if I can trust the quality? Maybe you can make a suggestion?

This is the setup:
It is a heavy duty industrial 12v DC RAM motor. Size: 80mm diameter x 140mm long.

The speed controller is a 36v variable voltage speed controller with built in low battery powercut to protect the battery. Size: 93mm( L) x 64mm(W) x 32mm(H).

The top speed is 50km/hr (if you weight around 70kg). Max distance on a single charge is 25km. It takes 5hrs to fully charge. 

Twist grip throttle
Aluminium  Motor  Axle  Bracket
38 Tooth  Sprocket
12 Tooth  Sprocket
Timing  Belt

36V Lead  Acid  Battery  Pack: He said: "(you can use lithium polymer, which is much lighter and smaller and can be mounted under the board, but its much more expensive)"

What do you guys think?

Hey Everybody!

My name is Jamy and I'm from Belgium. I recently started planning an e-board build. My plan is to convert my [small cruiser board](http://www.dusterscalifornia.com/product/bird-mod) to an electric one (1 motor). Reason for the cruiser is that I take the train a lot and carrying a longboard on the train together with my luggage isn't that easy, the cruiser just straps to my backpack.

The plan:

- Vesc (Waiting on Enertion to get my order through, last update was mid June so pretty much after my exams, which is good.)
- Turnigy SK3 245KV (HobbyKing's stock of motors is horrible right now so I hope that comes through next month)
- 4x ZIPPY 5000mAh 3S 25C batteries, I'll be mounting 2 for 6S and I'll swap in the other 2 if I need extra range.
- Paris 180 trucks, 83mm wheels and Enertion drive belt and things (Have already arrived :) )
    - I hope this won't look too funny, the trucks I have now are quite a bit smaller :stuck_out_tongue: 
- Logic 3 wireless nunchuck, I'll be trying it with the VESC, not scared of having to make code changes if needed. It's one of the only Wireless nunchucks you can find in Europe for a decent price.

I'll certainly make a progress thread/videos, not sure yet. I just hope the motor doesn't stay AWOL for too much longer...

Hi. My name is David I am 21 years old.  I have a history of tinkering with guitars, amps, and computers.  I just got my first electric skateboard (a chinese clone) so my current plans is to learn as much as I can then decided if the best course of action is to mod it (change esc with vesc, swap battery, give it a hub motor) or to just sell and build my own from scrap.

* loaded tant tien flex 1 deck
* paris 195mm trucks
* oragantang kegel wheels
* two 220kv alien power systems sensored motors
* two alien drive system motor mounts with the corresponding wheel hubs

Hi,

My name is Luis Sismeiro and I'm from Portugal. I become interested in electric longboards after seeing Casey Neistat riding a boosted Board in his vlog. I believe many of the people now interested in electric longboards were also "inspired" by Casey.

Currently I'm 42 years old and I never had a skate or roller skates and I decided to learn now how to ride an electric longboard. I already saw many videos explaining how to ride a normal skate but I look forward for the real thing.

Electric longboards are a very rational option for every day last mile (1.609 kilometre if you are in a metric system country) commute if weather permits it. Also as an enjoyment, riding around with the wind gently blowing in your face should be a nice feeling.

As my first electric longboard I decided to go with a pre-built. I'm still waiting for it to arrive at my home and shouldn't take much longer since the boat coming from China already arrived to Europe. Yes, it's a Chinese clone but after doing all the math and seeking other options it was the less expensive way that I found to have an electric longboard.

I though going DYI for my first electric longboard since I like to thinker with things and I already built a quadcopter from scratch when "drones" weren't as known as today more than 4 years ago. The decision to go with a pre-built was made because I don't want to have the hassle of dealing with the LiPo batteries maintenance particularities and because importing individual components from all over the world to Europe is expensive.

Currently, while I'm expecting my electric longboard to be delivered, I'm reading about the DYI projects and understanding all parts an electric longboard needs in case I have to upgrade my pre-built board with new components or repair it. Now that I understand better about the trucks, motors, drive trains, etc. I'm becoming more and more interested in building my on electric longboard. Only time will tell if I go that route or not.

I hope to continue learning through the information provided in this forum and eventually help others with their doubts. Let's see how this new project will go, I hope I don't have to break a bone or two before start riding comfortably in an electric longboard.

Regards,
Luis Sismeiro

Welcome @sismeiro

Don't worry ... Leaning to ride and electric skateboard is a lot easier than just leaning to kick and ride on a normal board...(in my opinion)....I think it's because you can control the speed and have the ability to stop... Balance and trigger control... Pretty much what you need to worry about.

Oh btw .... 44 here 😉

Alright, my adventure starts here :smile:

I've been a happy owner of a Yuneec e-go for quite some time here but it recently died on me.  As I researched ways to fix it, I found this great community.  In all honesty, I've been reading you for a few weeks now, spying on your conversations, learning from you.  Today, I feel I know enough to get started on my project, my 1st DIY of possibly many.  

My project is actually underway.  Its REALLY hard to get the part where I'm from (Montreal, Canada).  I managed to get a 250kv 6362 Power HD Motor, and that after 3 weeks of searching.  Everything else I had to order online. 

Gear as of now:
1. The mentioned motor
2. Ordered a VESC from http://www.ollinboardcompany.com/  Am I right to think this is from @chaka ?
3. Got the single motor mount, wheels, pulleys, belt etc from DIY (Can't wait to get it)
4. Got my Caliber 180mm trucks
5. Gonna mount all this on my Loaded Fat tail
6. Got the remote from DIY also

At this point, all im missing are the batteries, wires, XT90 Loop key, fuse and enclosure.   Am I missing anything? :)

Im excited!

I only recently started eskating when I got my Boosted Board earlier this year. I soon sold it to buy the GT from evolve, but I'm still short a fair amount of money. So I turned to Enertion and saw theres this whole forum, and I'm basically looking around on how to build a board. I'd love to make a fast and long range board. Similar in style to the Boosted Board but obviously with better specifications.

Hi everyone my name is Jared and I have been kicking around the idea of a build for about a year now.  However I am just starting to learn what is involved.  Sorry for being that guy but I am trave!ing by boat with mostly very slow internet (when I can get it) and just a cheap tablet for surfoing the net.  I apologize in advance for not utilizing the search option more.  What I want to build is a electric mountain board that is capable of crushing at 35mph ish and a range of 25ish miles.  I would like it to weigh around 25 pounds and it will have a carry handle.  I move boats by water so I will be carrying the board with me to run errands and exploring new areas when I can.  So can I  it when it is raining?  What motors?  I want to go with lion batteries but how much battery do I need for what I want?  I am mainly on the east coast so some hills but not too extreme.  I weigh about 180 but want the abiliability to carry about 20-30 pounds in a backpack so I am figuring total weight at about 210.  I have not set a budget yet.  Is this a pipe dream or can it be done?  I want to hear your ideas and comments.  Thanks iin advance.

From Brisbane Australia, snowboarding is my passion until I bought an evolve carbon 2 in one, love it, big carving machine ! but it's too big for a commuter besides I like to tinker. 
Have a second hand evolve carbon board with 2 failed cells, bluetooth receiver and controller, evolve esc and misc bearings screws etc.
kitted it with sidewinders and abec 83mm flywheels. Hope to turn this into a longer range version. I Have two 170kv 3kw motors I bought from George from Baja boards. Waiting on two vesc's from enertion then will see how this runs!
Was going to keep it 10s so I can use the existing charger. Will this be OK for the vesc ? I read that the vesc is designed for 12s for a 170kv motor but at $130 for two of these motors I had to have them
I do like to jump on in and found a brand new truncated tesseract with caliber 2 trucks for $250. Have an enertion bracket ready and 2 50mm sk3's coming  from hobby king. This will likely be my finace's board as she loves the tesseract shape.
Found a local supplier of Samsung 25r's for $9 each or LG HG2's for $12. Am thinking the LG's for this build to keep the weight down.
Round three will be a beach board ! Something like a mbs pro 100.

When all those cheap chinese hoverboards started catching fire our government introduced a whole new bunch of fee's, I mean laws, regarding transportation of dangerous goods. Transporting 100 cells from Melbourne to Brisbane, about 1600 km roughly 1000 miles costs $100.
$5 US is about $7 AUD anyway. And yes, this is an expensive country to live in. For example, a carton of beer - round $50. :frowning:

E-Sk8er here ....Watching and reporting the growth of the electric skateboard movement.  

It is a child's dream come true for most of the e-boarders around the world.  Technology has made it possible.

We will follow, watch and report on electric skateboards, pre-built and DIY solutions. We will do our best to be accurate and unbiased.

In the end we would like to contribute to the growth of electric skateboarding by providing a central place to find retailers and vendors to either purchase a prebuilt e-board or whom to purchase parts.

We have just started and are looking at the whole industry and the major players.  So, your input would be greatly appreciated.

At the moment we are working with social media, specifically FACEBOOK and Instagram, but we also have Twitter and tumblr.  We are still thinking of the format of the website and find reposting information via our Instagram and FACEBOOK, is much more "real time" as a pose to a website.
 
So for now you can find us here:

ESk8er.com will take you to our FACEBOOK
instagram.com/electricsk8er will take you to our INSTAGRAM 

It will be highly unlikely you will see a post from us, but know we are lurking...in a good way. 

We have already reposted some things from (some) of the "DIY guys" @onloop, @torqueboards, @psychotiller @LEVer and @jacobbloy ....links to certain products and have posted from Evolve, Inboard, Mellow etc...

You'll also see us post links to DIY videos from YouTube that relate to electric skateboards.  

Hope you give us a follow...and hope to hear from you via email ElectricSk8er@gmail.com

Good Day :smiley:

 New builder here, Anyways I would want to create an electric longboard mainly to get to and from school, the road here is not smooth, there are lots of cracks and bumps so just wanted to keep that in mind. Im going for a boosted inspired look. Im still a student so I would greatly appreciate any if you guys can recommend/adjust parts specially to help with the price.Anyways, forgive me if the components I list are wrong, I don't have any experience yet, we all start somewhere right hahaha
Anyways, here is my plan:

**_HARDWARE_**
**Board**; Ill be making my own board using plywood, I found a Loaded Vanguard Template so I decided to go for that.

**Trucks**: Caliber II Fifty Caliber 10"/50 Degrees Blackout Skateboard Longboard Trucks ($35)
Other Longboard Hardware: ($4)

**Wheels**: Orangatang Kegel 80mm ($60)

Motor Mount: Single Bolt On Motor Mount w/ Drive Wheel Kit From  ($147)
I choose the 14T/36T Kegel Drive Wheel kit. I decided to go for this kit, since I do not have readily accessible drills and welding machine, And I might want to adjust the motor mount for future purposes. 

**_ELECTRONICS_**
**Battery**:
2x Turnigy 5000mAh 3S 20C Lipo Pack from Hobby King ($50)
Connected in series w/
HXT 4mm Series Connector with 12awg Wire from Amazon ($10)
Skyrc Imax B6 Professional Rapid Lipro Balance Charger/discharger ($36)
HobbyKing™ Lipo Voltage Checker (2S~8S) ($2)

**Remote**: Hobbyking IOS & Android 4CH WiFi Receiver ($28.75)
I have a old compact android phone laying around, so I decided to use this as a controller instead.

**Motor**: Turnigy Aerodrive SK3 - 5065-236kv Brushless Outrunner Motor ($57)
I would appreciate if you guys could recommend a better motor, I am fairly light around 130lbs including backpack already.

**ESC**: TrackStar 150A GenII 1/8th Scale Sensored Brushless Car ESC - (PC Programmable) ($81.90)
Turnigy TrackStar Turbo and Waterproof ESC Programming Box ($12.86)
Do I still need the programming box? I wont buy it anymore if the ESC can be configurable with beeps lol. Would also appreciate if you guys can recommend a cheaper ESC, probably 120A can do the work.

**Other stuff**: Xt60 Male and Female,  5 pairs from Amazon ($2)
3.5mm Male Female Banana Plug Bullet Connector Replacements 20 Pairs Amazon ($3.42)
I still need to get a soldering Iron

Total: As of now ~$510

Of course I have not ordered anything yet, Ill be glad to cut down the price and adjust accordingly
With that, Would I need to change/reconsider/get anything else?

Thanks for reading and Have a great day :D

5A at 6S will give you around 6-7 miles per charge, if you need more range then get other 2, also maybe start your build thread to get more/better feedback

Hey there, I'm Jesper 43 years young.
Father of two awesome daughters, husband to my lovely wife and owner of the cutest Amstaff ever.
I went through the whole internet I think and ordered a Acton blink board but quickly realized that it's a toy and preordered a boosted board v2.
When I stumbled on the Raptor I canceled the preorder and put my money to a dual Raptor instead.
I know nothing about electric boards so I'm nervous about problems that need to be solved with the Raptor when getting it.

Hey guys, new member looking for a summer project! This is really going to be used to get from the parking lot to maybe closer to my classes. I won't be using this on the streets at all, just smooth pavement. My goal budget is around $200-250 before shipping and miscellaneous parts like connectors, solder, and tools. 

Top speed: 8-10 mph (I'm 185 lbs/84 kg)
Range: 1-2 miles with load

**Is a $200-250 budget doable?** I was reading the forum and looking at builds for the last two days, but it's hard to find where to cut cost. It looks like I can shave a few bucks on the battery (not worth it IMO), a higher kV motor, and *maybe* the ESC. The best bang for my bucks seems to be a self-made mount. I foresee myself having a lot of headaches going this route since I can't weild. I was thinking of getting the DIY single drive kit w/ mount from DIY ($126.99), but I haven't decided.

Anyways, thanks for reading my rant!

I'd say no. Chech my build out: [http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/400-build-ebay-deck-sk3-149kv-20-28t-6s-lipo-150a-car-esc/4386](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/400-build-ebay-deck-sk3-149kv-20-28t-6s-lipo-150a-car-esc/4386)

Basically as cheap as it can get without sacrifices. You will probably use the money you could save by using wheel clones on the 3D prints (I had a friend that helped me out for free and can print at work) - so the total should be aroudn the same.

You're probably right. Durability is an issue the cheaper I get too. I might scour the marketplace and take my time piecing things if that's the case.

@EpicCell That looks amazing and expensive

I searched for builds I could use in the woods and found:
http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/off-road-electric-skateboard/629

Very similar

I was hoping I could do a build in the 900-1000£ range

I think you can get away with a e-toxx setup with 1000 pounds!  That is like MILLIONS OF CADs for a canadian like me ;).  Plus, Trampa boards are shipped form the UK so BAM, more savings.  I wish I could build one...  Eventually.  

Your dog is AMAZING and possibly faster than any build you will ever build ;).  

Good luck

I am uncertain if my longboard deck is compatible in making a E-Longboard. I have some pictures below of it. Some more info I have:

* Deck Length = 40.5 inches [or 1029mm]
* Current Wheels = 75mm [I bought 83mm Wheels though]
* Current Trucks = 165mm [I bought Caliber 2 trucks to replace]
------
* Bought a SK3 6364 190kv motor
* Bought diyelectricskateboard VESC (since it takes time to deliver). 

Will be building the mechanical part later this week once the trucks come in.

So what you guys think about my current board? The deck is like 9 out of 10 on stiffness, just a bit beat up. Will restore it as well.

Hi!

My name's Ludvig and I live in Sweden. I've been planning my first build for the past few weeks, and think now I got most figured out. Only thing left is to order the parts, and build it. I'm using a longboard deck and will build a one wheel drive. I have some questions that I haven't been able to find answers to yet, so I would really appreciate it if someone could help me out.
This is the list of parts so far:
• Motor Mount, Wheel pulley (36t), Motor pulley (16t) and drive train from DIY.
• The SK3 245kv motor, from Hobbyking
• VESC, from DIY
• 2 x Turnigy LiPo batteries 4s 5000mAh to put in series, from Hobbyking
• The Mini Remote Controller from DIY
• Anti-Spark Connector from Hobbyking
I'll also need a charger but I'm not sure yet on what I should go for. Any advice? 
When doing the wiring to connect the batteries in series and then to the VESC, in a way so you can simply charge the batteries while also connecting the anti-spark plug. Do you guys have any advice on leads and connectors that I should buy? Also is the anti-spark connector necessary? I couldn't figure out what kind of balance leads I need for charging my two 4s batteries, and will I need to buy a cable to connect the receiver to the VESC?
The board I'm using has some flex in it so I'm thinking I will put the motor, VESC and receiver on one end, and the batteries on the other. In addition to the many questions I already asked, if anyone has any opinions on the rest of the parts feel free to enlighten me.

I'm really happy to join your community, and appreciate all the help I can get!
Greetings from Gothenburg!

If not, what's a good motor for around this price? Also, why everyone here talks about the vesc? Why is it better than others less expensive esc on the market?

No it is not. You should aim a motor between 100-300kv. Maybe just aim about 200kv.[quote="paoloalb, post:345, topic:216"]

It was already stated in several other threads: You have endless possibilities...You can tweak every corner of this esc and much more.

Hi my name is Moe 
I'm looking to build my first electric long board, I've done some research and have come up with the following parts for the electronics of the build (excluding transmitter, receiver and balance charger) 

Motor: 
http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/uh_viewitem.asp?idproduct=18129

ESC 
http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/__32127__HobbyKing_174_8482_Brushless_Car_ESC_100A_w_Reverse_Upgrade_version_AU_Warehouse_.html

Batteries X2
http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/__8583__ZIPPY_Flightmax_5000mAh_3S1P_25C.html 

I believe these three parts are compatible with each other but my only concern is that the motors spec say "14TVoltage: 10~12S" after rewiring the two 3s batteries I will have 6s. Will this 6s be sufficient or will it not be compatible with this configuration?
I would greatly appreciate any help with this. 

Thanks!!!

Hello eSk8 community! I've been sifting through this place for weeks helping to decide on my pre-built and get ideas for my DIY boards. Have at least 4 builds on the cards atm, mostly for other people. For myself, I'd like a DIY Raptor Dual AT and a Trampa. Can't wait! Loving my Evolve Carbon AT, but knew before I ordered it wouldn't tackle the hills in my area. Will get tonnes of use before I upgrade to my DIY.

Hello my name is Michael, i live in NZ, ive been wanting an eboard for a while now but stuck on what to do :-/ i have the perfect board for it (in my eyes) but when i add everything up that i want it would be cheaper to get an evolve bamboo series. I like the idea of adding to it later but after buying some great slim batteries motor mounts etc it would be around the same price and i dont think i could do as a good job as an evolve board so kind of stuck on what to do. Any suggestions would be great, was thinking of enertion battery and maybe go with a single motor for now.

Hi eBoarders,

Been lurking around this site for awhile, think it is time to say hello! 

Welcome, My name is Darien, I'm 48 years old. I have 6 lovely children. The oldest is 24 and the youngest are 2, yes a set of twin boys. I got into eboards when I was looking for an alternate source of 🚆 transportation while commuting.  Came up with a wonderful idea. Helped solve my techie nature and transpotation issue as well as recreation. Couldn't have found a better solution. 
 I'm a jack of all trades. I can pretty much do anything I put my mind to. My main career is :barber: barbering. I cut hair for a living. Love it to death. I'm also a video gamer, comic book lover, photographer, dj, build :computer: computers, carpenter, painter, chef cook, bake and BBQ. Also rollerskate quad wheels. Now I want to try a hand in e-board skating and building. Looks like a well stable community. Getting all my parts ready. Done a lot of research and I'm pretty much ready. Hope to talk to everyone soon. Are there any e-boarders who live or reside near the Dallas/Ft. Worth Metroplex. Would Love to hear from you and build a community e-boarders here.

First board setup,
Long board Downhill Top Mount Quality Skateboard 37"x9.75 Zenith Gripped D28
2xVESC - enertion (hope it gets shipped today)
Duel R-spec 2.0 Uber+ 6355 190kv - enertion
Duel rear motor mounts & bolts - enertion
2x 50 Degree Enertion High-Speed e-board trucks
2x 36 tooth quick install - bearing drive hub
2x15 tooth steel motor pulleys
2x High Torque HTDS timing belt
4x Enertion 83mm 78a Duro High Performance Wheels
2x Truck Riser Kit
8x High Speed ABEC 9 Bearings
4x Bearing Spacers
8x Deck Bolts
1x Space Cell Pro Enclosure
nunchuck remote

Second board setup, for wife.
36" x 9.25" Double Kicktail Longboard Deck 8ply 
2x DIY dual 1500W electric skateboard parts kit 97MM wheel 7"truck N5065
2x Pulleys and Belts T5 for Motors Pulleys for Transmition System-Onda Longa and Mammoth Skateboard
R-Snake ESC 8S 50A 34V EV FOR DUAL MOTORS
She has other specific specs she would like. I asked her to join the forum but declined. So I'll be asking any questions she has.

I'll post pics when I finish the build, just waiting on the VESC to arrive.

Yes I say so myself. The EnertionBoard package. The first build is for commuting on public transit. So I really don't have time to waist. Was looking at pre-fab boards at first then ran in to this DIY community. I just fell in love so I decided to go ahead and build my own. Wife was checking me out. Then she decided she wanted one. I said ok we can make a more custom one together after I build this first. So our next boards will be more creative.

Hi there,

I finally clicked on that signup button, after reading every single topic for 2 months... Kind of late to the party, but I've come to a point where I have to participate to all that fuss.
I'm dreaming of a super mini esk8, so don't have a lot of space to deal with...
I'd like to start a new topic for battery related calculations, the vedder way. I don't see the new topic button here, it is related to my new user status?

Btw, I'm from France.

Hey!
I've been lurking across the forum pretty aggressively over the last few days, decided to make an account and say hello. I'm a college student, currently in Poughkeepsie, NY but will be back to campus in Troy, NY next month. Super hyped to piece together a build list, I'm thinking of a single motor VESC setup. I have some serious hills on campus so I'm thinking about going with the wonderful Enertion's single motor kit. Reading up on batteries and the rest before I make a build post. 

Awesome forum and community, looking forward to contributing!

Get the lowest KV motor ... Like a 149 kv and keep your gearing low ... 12t if you can

Hi, My name is Ryan, living in Melbourne and am just about to create my first E board. I had pre ordered a 2 gen boosted board and found the DIY scene on these boards, so after a few days of reading have ordered what I hope is enough parts to start a build. Am still getting my head around the VESC thing, so hopefully when that arrives from Enertion I'll be able to work out what the go is. Anyone else in here around Melbourne Australia?

Hi i´m Stefan, living in Pforzheim / Germany.

Past the last weeks i read a lot in this forum and decided to electrify my O&H fd98 Board.

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/9/91c849a2bacdf13ab9c153c57d0ccf0cc279ffb0.jpg" width="690" height="459">

Here are the parts which i ordered for my build:

- 190 KV Alien Power System 6355 Motor with 2200 Watts
- VESC
- 16/36 Gearing with 1cm belt
- 80a Orangatang Kegels
- 2x Turnigy 5S 5000 mAh Lipo-Batterys. Will be using them in series for a 10S Setup
- Same Nano Remote @Kaly is selling these days
- DIY Motormount and Pulley

Having some hills here i hope that my gearing ratio and my motor can handle a few climbs. Because i wanted a highspeed of about 45 km/h / 28 mp/h and can´t afford a dual setup, i needed to go for this ratio. Fortunately i only weight about 65 kilos, so i think the setup will work for me.

I think the parts will arrive next week that i can start with the building process.

There is my plan:

ESC - Maytech 150A ESC for e-board

And 6s 5000mah battery for beginning.

All mechanical parts like motor mount will be custom. So, will this set work? I'read a lot, but still not sure about this.

Hello everybody!

I'm in the UK, currently designing my first build. 

I'm thinking about a 36/40" ish kicktail board (as I love that style on my little Penny), but struggling to find a board that I want that doesn't eat my purse with the shipping fees :confused: 

Aiming for more of a good torque build rather than top speeds as I have lots of hills as well as flat areas around me.

Anyway, I'll post up progress pics as soon as I have my parts.

I built my first longboard in 1969 aged 10 using skate board wheels. I havent boarded for about 4 years. I am considering building an electric one and could do with some advise. My plan is not to use radio or wifi. I like light weight wooden boards so I was thinking of setting up the electrics and battery in a dedicated back pack with a cable which can just be joined to the motor with ease. It allows for extra battery power and no need for radio. A hand device similar to an old fashioned scale electrix would be used to control speed and breaking. What advise do you guys have for an old timer.

Hello everyone. My name is Elmer J Fudd. Millionaire. I own a mansion and a yacht.

Kidding aside my name is Kevin from Whitby, Ontario. Canada. I'm also in the 40+ club. I one day dream of moving somewhere hot where I never have to wear socks again and the hardest choice I have to make is which flip flops to wear and which board to grab on the way out the door. I have an extensive background in high powered electric rc cars, trucks and boats. So eSk8 is right up my aIley. I recently picked up a semi complete kit and a 12s3p from DIY @torqueboards. Man our Canuck dollar blows right now. I'll start a thread when I make some progress. My board is 40" Globe Great Dane with double kick. Btw my favourite thread so far is the No words, Just Pictures thread.

Thanks to everyone who contributes to this community.

*added edit - I also just ordered a flagship enclosure from @psychotiller so I can use my nanotech 65-135c  5s 5000's until I have a proper enclosure for my li-on pack.

Hello guys, I've been reading/using this great forum for a while but never introduced myself. I'm a 24 year-old dude from Argentina that started liking e-skateboards while watching Casey Neistat's videos, wanted to buy a Boosted Board but as it was impossible to get them here, the whole idea of building my own arised, plus it's so fun...

So as buying new parts is also really difficult here (lots of custom/import problems that may disappear soon), I bought a whole set of used stuff including:

* Custom truck with motor mount called LaGrange L1 from Redrock Boardshop
* 2700W Turnigy 6364-245kv
* ESC Mamba Monster 2
* Turnigy 4500mah 6S. 

The remote sucks cause it's for RC and is huge but anyway.

So I attached that e-kit to my new longboard consisting of:

* Riviera Amanda Powell Ursa Major deck
* Paris trucks
* Bear bearings
* Arbor 69mm wheels that I changed now for 83mm ones

Here are some pics of my _really_ DIY build:
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/3/3a2c34a805d2e28706757d0721a7bfce9e42f780.jpg" width="375" height="500">

Now, it has a range of 10 to 12 km, and I've used it only in 80% throttle going 25km/h, it may go up to 40km/h but I find that kinda dangerous haha.

My main problem is weight, I don't really know how much it weighs but it's too much to carry compared to my skateboard (obviously), but I'd like to remove as much weight as possible and thought of changing the deck for a lighter one. Gonna probably start a thread asking for suggestions.

Then I plan on building a custom 18650 battery pack if I manage to get the cells.
And I wanna start using fiberglass to make some enclosure designs.

Any suggestions on how to remove more weight (probably with the fiberglass enclosure I can remove the ESC one) will be greatly appreciated. Thanks for reading!

Greetings, dudes.

Just signed up, been looking at an electric longboard for a while now as I live on an island in the Mediterranean and, with the right board, could drive across the entire country in one charge. It'll also be more fun than walking or diving and, seeing as there are never waves in Malta, as close to surfing as it's possible to get.

I'm planning on the DIY board as it'll be more fun than simply ordering an Evolve and it'll be easier to customise and add on to later. So, here it is, a list of parts:

1. Hi5ber Limelite Deck
2. Enertion Space Cell Pro 4 battery pack
3. Enertion Mono Drive R-Spec Pro+
4. Enertion VESC
5. Psychotiller "Winning" thumb stick controller

While I'm here, could one or two of the more experienced builders provide me with a helping hand?

Seeing as I am a complete rank amatuer, are there any other parts that I would need to build?

Also, if any Enertion people are listening, I'm buying the mono drive for starters but have every intention of upgrading to a dual drive once I'm used to the board and the conditions here in Malta (roads are quite bad and it's humid as balls pretty much all year round). Now then, the question, The R-Spec Pro+ comes with the "BIGBOY" motor, so would it be possible to buy another "BIG BOY" motor and strap it onto the other side of the trucks or would I need to buy two new smaller motors.  

I'll be uploading photos of the board when it's built, hopefully it'll work and hopefully it'll look pretty sweet.

Hey everyone I was wondering if you could help me out with my first build?
I had bought a bravo sports altered fantom 1.0 electric skateboard because I had always wanted to get an electric skateboard but don't have much money.

I have to say it was a decent starter board however it only had a 100w motor which is probably why it was only 200$ considering the parts were most likely made in china. 

Anyway, I wanted to build a board since I still want an electric skateboard since the fantom was still a ton of fun to ride. My parts list is as follows:

build #1:
 Turnigy Aerodrive 280kv Brushless Outrunner Motor ($50)
36 tooth pulley (Part #: A 6A25-036NF0910) ($20)
14 tooth pulley (Part #: A 6A25M014DF0906) ($11)
5mm timing belt (Part #: A 6R25M054090) ($8)
2" washer
1/4 aluminum blank (Min size 121mm by 51mm)
6x 1/4" by 2.5" bolts
6x 1/4" 20 nuts
4x M4 by 12mm bolts
4x M4 washers
2x 5000mAh 20c 3 cell (11.1v) Lithium Battery ($47)
EZRUN/HobbyWing 150A-PRO Brushless ESC ($80)
Lithium Battery Charger (I use the IMAX B6) ($25)
4mm Banana Jacks (6 pairs) ($4)
10 gauge flexible wire (2 feet) ($7)
2 3s to 6s Balance Adapter ($1)
6s Balance Extension Cable ($1)
HK-GT2B Transmitter and Receiver (25$)

this was taken from the http://www.instructables.com/id/Electric-Longboard/ thread and modified a little bit.

build #2: 
 Motor: Turnigy Aerodrive SK3 - 5065-275kv Brushless Outrunner Motor
battery 2x: Turnigy 5000mAh 3S 20C Lipo Pack
Controller and receiver: HobbyKing® ™HK-GT2B 3CH 2.4GHz Transmitter and Receiver w/Rechargable Li-ion Battery
Motor controller: vesc-standard
pullies kit: 12mm-wide-pulley-drive-hub-kit
2" washer
1/4 aluminum blank (Min size 121mm by 51mm)
6x 1/4" by 2.5" bolts
6x 1/4" 20 nuts
4x M4 by 12mm bolts
4x M4 washers

alternatives
motor: alien-5065-sensored-outrunner-brushless-motor-270kv-2200w-2


this was taken and modified from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yBgsT65UPg

I am using a long board I have been riding for a while now that has fly wheels and good trucks, if you guys can help me with this build or see any complications or compatibility issues please let me know. Right now I think I'm going to use the second build.

Hello all, my name is Sam.
I've decided I want to build an E-Board for commuting to and from my house and University. 
I've gone for a smaller 28" board for portability and I have a few parts-however I don't know whether they will work for the project or not.

I have:
* Two motors from old RC cars, not sure of the Kv of them (they don't say).
* The speed controllers from the cars.
* 3 batteries (1800mah,7.2V) but I have no idea about the C-Rate.
* Transmitter and receiver.

I may yet end up buying a new motor as the two motors are on the small size.
Speed wise I'm not too concerned, 12-15mph seems a good pace, especially to start with. 

Any help would be much appreciated.

**Quentin, 21yo, from paris.**

_hey there, i'm either super novice about skateboarding AND electronic/mechanic, but i love to learn._
_i discovered electric skateboard because of casey neistat about 3 weeks ago, and i've NEVER heard about it before. I first wanted to buy one because i walk a lot and it looks pretty fun, but i wanted something much smaller than a longboard, so i can carry it arround, like a cruiser. didn't find any electric cruiser to buy on the market, and most of the suppliers don't ship in europe anyway._

_we thought with a friend that it would be a great opportunity to start a business. we basically want to take orders from french people interested of buying an electric skateboard who have "specifics requests", then we buy what we need, what the client wants, and ship it to him. the client buys exactly what we ordered to build it + the shipping + i don't know.. 30% of the total price for the labour..?_

_i suppose that i am the 9999th to came up with this idea, but not in france i guess.. so here is my question:_

**can we start from nothing and learn everything about electronic and mechanic by ourself (internet), or we really need to have studied/worked in electronic/mechanic to make this project run correctly ?**

_thanks for reading me._

_ps: i suppose we would not drown under orders in the beggining._

Hi I'm new here and I've already built just about everything for my board and its all working although I'm having a petty issue thats starting to get quite annoying. I have calibrated my ESC with my remote and it works fine, the problem is that the remote has three positions for the trigger to be and the position it naturally goes to does not stop the motor. So i have to constantly pull the trigger all the way in order for the motor to stop spinning and then if I let the trigger go the motor spins at half speed and the pushing the trigger forward makes it go the fastest. I've looked everywhere and haven't found anyone else with this problem and I've tried calibrating it many different ways to no avail. So how do I make it so that the natural position (middle) is stop, pulling the trigger is accelerate, and pushing the trigger is brake?
Remote: HK-GT2B, 
ESC: Hobby King 80A ESC 4A SBEC
Motor: Turnigy Aerodrive SK3

From the Hobbyking manual

Also: this is what you get for buying a helicopter/plane ESC. As far as I can understand that manual you do not have brakes - or more precisely you only have a 100% brake. This will not work for esk8s.
```

---
## \#463 Posted by: Sleepingalex24 Posted at: 2016-08-02T14:17:44.830Z Reads: 155

So I will have to get a new ESC? On the 4th page it says this:
1. Brake: turn on/turn on/turn on/turn on/turn off
Turn on: the propeller stops immediately when the throttle works under the smallest position.
Turn off: the propeller stops naturally when the throttle works under the smallest position.
If I turn off could this be the solution? I would prefer not to buy a new ESC if possible.
```

---
## \#464 Posted by: TarzanHBK Posted at: 2016-08-02T14:28:10.737Z Reads: 157

```
so looks like you got a wrong esc without usable brakes. Your esc is only capable of full stop - you get thrown off your board, or releasing throttle - no braking.
Only car escs can be used for eskating with proper brakes. Or better a VESC.
So if you dont mind riding around without brakes you can keep your esc, if not, get yourself a car esc or vesc.

In that case Ben is on enertion's team as well since they are using his VESC, and on anyone's team who is using his VESC.  I might as well add him to my team then cuz all my boards have the VESC haha.

Yea I'm not really sure.  From what I understood they are just using his VESC, and when they say "custom developed model"...they just mean the VESC.

It's just shady that they call him a "team member".  The picture they are using on their webpage is taken straight from google images.  

But I don't know any better, maybe he did do something for them.  Ben V is a genius and this community is very lucky to have some as brilliant as him develop the VESC.  I just find it hard to believe that he would work for a random E-board manufacturer that most people have not even heard of.

That is only true for US people because faraday is located in Denmark - US people don't care about european businesses ;)

Benjamin is not working on develepment of new design with Faraday Motion (we are heading in slightly different difection with motor controllers - you can read about our "brain" [here](http://makerspace.faradaymotion.com/project/using-a-cheap-wifi-microcontroller-as-the-main-brain-controlling-the-vescs?stage=making) but since his job is a big part of our project, and he was cooperating with our CEO to make Spine happen - he is listed as part of the team on our website.

So he either was or still is part your team.
If he was then your website text needs to be changed!

Also what has a remote controller to do with a motor controller?
The "brain" you are describing reads just like a "receiver" for controller input. No motor controlling is done with it - so you still need the VESC (or other ESC).

You will need to buy a limo balance charger for your batteries instead of the Enertion charger. 

Something like am imaxb6 wI'll get the job done, and you can find them for cheaper than Enertions fast charger. 

The problem with the fast charger is that it was made for a 10s pack, and you have 2x6s packs- the voltage doesn't line up, and it also won't balance the cells. 

Hope this helps!

Thanks for the help man. 

I've been reading more into it and incorporating a BMS sounds useful. Have you had any experience with installing those? I've been looking into this one (http://www.batterysupports.com/44v-48v-504v-12s-60a-12x-36v-lithium-ion-lipolymer-battery-bms-p-270.html).

Since my budget is limited (Think on 1 dollar = 15 pesos), i'll be buying the parts in stages. The good part, i'll have plenty of time to read/learn/ask and (hopefully) don't fuck up things. The bad part, i'm impatient and spring in here is coming!

Now, my first question (Cassandra, Forum's Rep, told me that i could keep my original trucks and wheels). Seems like i have to make holes in my black wheels to fit the blue drive hub, isn't it? Anybody has gone thru this process?

This is it for now. Thanks Jason and Team for encourage people around the globe to ride electric with good quality/price products.

I've been looking to build or buy a new e-sk8 for the last couple months and have been researching a bit.  Have a ways to go still.  Was wanting to make a thread asking what kind of board people would like to build and why to get some opinions going to better form my own.

I weigh about 84 kg or 185 lbs.  I have hills around me so a dual motor setup is something I want.  I'm not sure on the range but rather just get a beefy battery as well.  Would prefer something fast (over 20mph maybe closer to 30 mph but I think I need to relearn skateboards ha).  Room to grow speed wise.

Either way rather hear suggestions or good thread links to check out because I'm learning and there is a lot of bs you have to wade through while learning.  Budget is around 1k because I'm trying to keep it cheap but I'm open if the need is there. I have a background in flying drones so I'm not a total new when it comes to motors battteries etc but I also know it's much different.  Any and all help would be appreciated.

Well I might as well say hi, HI! I'm jack from Santa Barbara CA and I'm getting the first few shipments to make my electric longboard.  I have been lurking here and other forums for a long time and I'm finally taking the plunge.  Here is my idea thanks to everybody for ideas and tips and I'm sure as I run into issues you will hear more from me.

Board - blank drop deck
Wheels - 97mm flywheels authentic 
Bearings - bones Swiss ceramic
Motor - dual 190kv 6355 (stealth group buy) 
ESC - chaka's vesc with heat sink
Battery - 12s 3p 45c lipo to start 12s 5p custom pack once all kinks are worked out
Motor mount - torque board v4's
Gear - will get every option I can and experiment with speed vs torque I don't have many hills here and beautiful paved roads and bike lanes so should be perfect riding conditions 
Controller - don't know.  Probably a mod case for something

I am going to route the deck and add a custom fiberglass bottom and lid to add strength and also keep everything as thin as possible.  

All black and stealthy and her name is Betty.  Black Betty 

Thanks again to everyone here I'm excited to build this, I was into downhill racing for years and this is just what I need for a bit of fun and excitement.

Hi There!

I'm Erik and I'm currently working here in SG. I have been lurking around here for a week now. I don't have any experience riding skateboards but I have experience with Hobby grade electronics for Drones, RC Cars, etc. 

I would love to build an esk8 but I don't have enough budget for a massive DIY kit. 

I'm planning on making a PennyBoard Commuter as my first Esk8. I can get a penny deck in the local online trading for a little over 5 USD.

 Also, I saw a guy selling everything needed to convert it to ESK8 for 270 USD.

Here are the specs of what he is selling: https://carousell.com/p/39378616/

the seller also told me that He will include a 7 inch. truck with the motor mount itself.:

https://d2xngy2dw7hums.cloudfront.net/media/photos/chat/107344329/1471933498.jpg

I'm planning to use my 3S lipos (1500mah 35C) from my drone racer, then join them in Series to make it 6S. (i'll upgrade to a bigger AH lipo in the future)

for this build tentative cost will be 275 USD (Penny board deck, Mechanical and electronics Kit, Trucks)

Are these parts okay for what I want? (Casual riding in the park, Commuting to the bus station, etc.)

What do you guys think? :slight_smile: 

Hope you can shed some light guys.

And this FORUM IS AWESOME!

Hey @Michaelinvegas

Yes, the pic of the truck is from the seller. the motor mount has screws to keep it from sliding in the truck. but yeah it seems he used some adhesives.

According to the seller:
- Motor is a 5065 320KV 3s - 8s. 
- ESC is 120A FVT.
- Planned gearing for me is 29:9 but he told me he has a set of gears for my preferred ratio.
- Gears are made from #45 steel according to him.

for you it's a no go? :slight_smile:

but for the price tho? or will it be more expensive in the long run? 

Thanks man.

Well hey there guys!

Heavily educated long time surface RC vet here. Got inspired about ESK8's by Casey Neistat and his boosted board. I'm sure a few of you guys know where I'm coming from. Decided to give it a shot, and here's the parts list I have down so far:

Deck: Method Camber Assault (short-ish board for tight city navigation in downtown Portland)
Truck: Caliber's
Wheel: Abec 11 clone
Mount: TB v4 kit w/pulleys and belts
Pulley and belt: 16t/36t
Motor: Turnigy Aerodrive SK3 - 6364-245kv
ESC: Enertion VESC but considering FVT 120A for temp testing
Battery: x2 6s 4000mah lipo parallel 
Remote Controller: Was looking at the Quanum from HK... any good?
Battery case: Custom

A few questions I have, the motor is already ordered as it was short stock at HK, and I live about 30min from the warehouse pickup so I said screw it. Did I go to high on the KV? Also, is 6s going to toot my horn or am I going to want more juice? I'm a VERY light rider, about 130lb currently, and I won't be taking on anything much greater than 15-20% grade max.

A VERY detailed build log will be posted once all parts arrive. Lemme know what you guys think plz :smiley:

Hey all, long time longboarder here. Looking to get into eboards, as I'm interested in electrical and mechanical engineering, and I love boarding. Win win as I see it.

I'm looking to spend about $750 dollars, and i'm going to try for as sleek and discreet a look as I possibly can. 

Therefor, I have assembled a parts list that I am hoping to get some feedback on:

Deck: Liqwood Invader deck(from older board I don't ride all that much)
Trucks/wheels: Looking at CarvON hub motor setup, either dual or single depending on what I ultimately decide I need.
ESC: one or two Enertion VESCs 
Battery: Enetrion SPACE cell Pro3 or Pro4, again depending
Remote: Enertion nano-X 2.4 Ghz controller

Please let me know what you all think, in terms of reliability and quality of my list. I am sticking mostly to larger(ish) brands, namely Enertion and CarvON, as I'm not at all confident in my ability to hack together a lot of possibly incompatible parts. Willing to switch nearly any component, just as long as it isn't too expensive or too indiscreet.

Thanks, Will.

Hi!

My name is Chris and I am from Sweden. My goal is to build a board that can go as far as possible, the speed is not that important, but around 16 mph or just a bot over, would be nice as top speed. Right now I am just lurking around and trying to understand the electrical side of this. I am more of a fabricator, the scary part is the ESC which is just some kind of black magic to me.

My setup will most likely be this(This setup may change when I learn more about everything):

Singel motor 190kv

ESC Vedders VESC

Zippy 6s 8000 mAh lipo X2

83 mm wheels not decided yet

Trucks not decided yet

Will fabricat my own mount

Enertion pulley kit:
1x 15t 12mm wide steel motor pulley
1x 36t 12mm wide nylon wheel pulley

The board might be a combination of an aluminium core laminated with a wood veneer
Some kind of enclosure that i will make myself
Some kind of controller

Thanks!
Chris

Hey all,

I'm David.  I haven't been on any kind of board since grade school and I am only household handy with tools, but I just bought a Dual Drive R-Spec Uber +. I figure starting out plug and play is the safest way for me to start, and then maybe modify,  then build from scratch later on down the line. The first mod will be maybe a year from now, but I know I will be thinking bigger wheels to better deal with crappy roads. It's not about speed on this for me. I do a lot of traveling for work, and I want it to be how I get around each town. Any suggestions on how to make things work well with a Dual Raptor setup would be appreciated. Things like max wheel size, what I should or should not switch out of the original set up, etc.

Thanks all!

David

Hi All,

I ordered all parts already actually. I will start building very soon.
Trucks were last piece I just ordered. I am thinking about cancelling that order. Because I found a complete longboard with very close price to what I am paying for 2 trucks.

Which of following options are better?

1 - Caliber 50 Raw 180mm trucks with my cheap shitty skateboard deck cut to fit this trucks and wheels.
2 - %60 discount on local store : This complete longboard with unknown brand trucks http://www.nakedskatelife.com/shop/naked-chicago-6423p.html

I got wheels, bearings, motors and all from Alien Power Systems. So low quality of wheels/bearings on 2nd option does not matter.
But I am concern about quality of trucks.

What do you think?
Please let me know as soon as possible, so I can cancel the order for trucks.

Cheers,
```

Hi everyone,

UK based first time builder here. Have been lusting after a Boosted Board ever since I saw them on KickStarter and was finally going to buy one of the various Chinese boards out there (Lecdec/Magneto etc.) until a couple of YouTube videos inspired me to build my own.

Still figuring out what my board is going to be right now. I've ordered all my longboard parts but no electronics as yet... Will be searching and asking a lot on here before that as I try to understand the finer points of kv, amps, ESCs etc.

No specific budget in mind - Looking for quality rather than cheap.

Here's what I have on order right now:

* Loaded Vanguard 38" Flex 3 - LOVE the look of this deck and it seems a few guys have built with it. It's what Boosted use and I'm happy with that as a benchmark.
* Caliber 2 50 184mm trucks - Seems that these are recommended for their build quality and ease of clamping motor mounts to. I spent a while deciding between 44 and 50 and chose 50 in the end.
* Orangatang Kegel 80mm wheels - LOVE the look of these wheels and again, Boosted seem to use them and I reckon that's a good starting point.
* Zealous ceramic bearings - Chose ceramic for ease of maintenance and (hopefully) reduced friction. Not skimping on the other parts so figured I'd go for good bearings too.

I think (hope!) that lot will make me a pretty nice longboard - Now I just need to electrify it!

Still on the shopping list (once I've figured out what I want):

* Motors (looking to make a dual motor board I think)
* Pulleys
* Belts
* Batteries
* Control system
```

Sup!! i have been around for a couple of days and have decided that during my studies this year(electronics enginering in milan , italy) i'll be taking a part time job to earn some money and build myself an eboard for next summer, i intend in designing myself an enclosure for the board and build myself a battery pack although i have never done it.
I have started to go through a lot of topics and decided for safety to make my own battery with a bms to charge it and although i weigh only 60 kg i will be going with a dual motor drive as the commute i have to do has a reeally steep hill on my way back home, so yeah... i really hope i'll be able to put together the money needed for a quality build !!!
until then, i have a question... I have ridden a small cruiser lately, do you recommend i borrow a longboard from a friend so that i get used to riding a skateboard or the learning curve is much better on an eboard ? thanks a lot, great forum and really useful for who like me is a nooooob!!!

Hi guys,
New to the forum. 
Got a few questions to ask and I think they may be a little tricky. I have a Fiik Street Surfer with an 800w motor. 
1. Can I add another motor to power the other wheel?
2. If this is possible, can I wire both motors up to the same remote?
3. Should I upgrade my batteries?

Any help would be great. 
Thanks,
Sam

Hi all!

30 year old child here from belgium and i freaking love boardsports. Skateboard and snowboard when i was younger and now doing kitesurf on our beautifull grey looking sea and wakeboard in a cablepark :slight_smile: . I am building an electric longboard to get to work on dry days to keep on boarding. It is a commute of 9km one way.

I am converting this beautifull deck from Jet to an electric one with:
- VESC
- Turnigy SK3 6374 192kv
- 15/36 gearing
- Space cell pro3
- Nano controller

I am now waiting endlessly on my parts but DHL is comming today and tomorrow so we are almost there :slight_smile:

More happy times are comming! 

btw thx to everybody who contribute on this forum. It is a massive source of valuable info. Kudos!

Greetings. Formalities have never been my strongsuit so i'll cut to the cheese. I have been lurking in the forums for a long tima and i finally decided to make myself an account. I am currently planning my esk8 build and have been for the past 4 months. I have done a lot of research and if all goes well its going to be awesome. 
Alright, so i'm a liar. I had to have a little rant before presenting the goodies. So, from day one I decided portability would be my main priority. I travel often and having something that can be easily transported when not in use is a must. So, a mini cruiser was a must. A single motor should suffice since I weight no more than a bag of feathers (for once my smaller build has paid off). I plan on doing an 8s2p configuration with 18650 cells and a bms. Why a bms? Because, plug n play solutions are simple. Im not worried about longer charging cycles either. I have all of my parts sort of laid out in sketchup and it all seems to fitt together quite nicely. The 2 things holding me back from purchasing all my parts now are the deck and motors. Do I buy a blank deck and diy a compartment for the goods or do I spend the extra dinero and diy a deck with cf and wood? Do I choose belt driven motors or motor hubs? Like I said im not to heavy so hub motors could work but belt driven options still seem more reliable. 
So yeah that's all (for now)  folks.

Hi all,

Im 31 years young and i'm about to build my first Eboard. I've been into racing Drones for the last 2 years and I think this is going to be my next addiction. I live around about 100 miles of Greenway Trails and I cant wait to ride them all. Just grabbed a Method board with Caliber II 50 trucks and some 83 flywheel wheels.  Going to be going with 6s for now with a SK3 6374 192kv motor, FVT 120 amp esc and a 16t/36t config. Will most likely upgrade later or build a completely new board next time around but figure this is a good starting point to get my feet wet. Hopefully Ill run into other Eboarders in Raleigh NC!

Hi all, Dan from London/UK.

Been lurking for a while, asked some questions about wheels here and there, but otherwise took quite some time and lots and lots of reading to really get started. Things are slowly coming along though, starting to get some of the parts in, so time to post the plan. 

High level, I'd like to try to do something like [made_in_the_alps Onda builds](https://endless-sphere.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=35&t=55266), +- some changes to account for tools I do or don't have (so I'm going belt driven, as the large metal pulley would be tricky for me to make; and plan to 3D print the large pulley, since I have a printer).

Note I'm in the UK, which affects some of these choices, e.g. import taxes, and HobbyKing have pretty limited stuff in the UK warehouse, especially battery choices..

**Already have:**
Onda Core (think a Vibe would be better, but you can't get them easily)
[VESC from Scramboards](https://www.scramboards.com/vesc-vedder.html)
[Wii nunchuck clone](http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/331847694924)
'[Wiichuck](http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/262460366406)' PCB (so I don't have to disassemble the nunchuck receiver)
[JST PH 6-pin](http://www.bitsbox.co.uk/index.php?main_page=product_info&cPath=225_338&products_id=2788) connector + [pins](http://www.bitsbox.co.uk/index.php?main_page=product_info&cPath=225_338&products_id=1667) (in the mail) (to be soldered to the Wiichuck PCB and plug that into the VESC)
Steel motor bracket "[GAH-Alberts 330514 90 x 90 x 65 mm](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B001BMG276/)" (*if anybody in the UK wants one, let me know, I had to buy a pack of them) 
[iMax B6 clone](http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/172052664607)

**Plan to buy:**
Faraday [sensored 190kv motor](http://shop.faradaymotion.com/shop/4-the-spine/47-faraday-motion-lightspeed-6364s-63mm-motor/)
Faraday [6S 5000mAh battery](http://shop.faradaymotion.com/shop/1-electronics/54-battery-6s/)
Faraday [16T small pulley](http://shop.faradaymotion.com/shop/32-components/79-faraday-motion---pulley-htd5-15mm/)
Faraday [Onda wheel with gear mount](http://shop.faradaymotion.com/shop/3-the-deck/31-wheel/)
Belt: not sure yet, will have to measure some distances once I cut and attach the bracket. But the general idea is to adjust the last few mm and tension the belt, by putting a spacer between the bracket and the Onda truck. Alternatively, I could try enlarging the screw holes in the plate to make them into channels, and then move the motor up and down to adjust it.
HobbyKing [XT60 Harness](http://www.hobbyking.co.uk/hobbyking/store/__31809__XT60_Harness_for_2_Packs_in_Series_1pc_UK_Warehouse_.html), and [XT90-S Anti-Spark Connector](http://www.hobbyking.co.uk/hobbyking/store/uh_viewitem.asp?idproduct=91007) (to be connected together as described on the anti-spark thread here)

**And to 3d print:**
One of the Faraday pulleys, or a [60T Onda pulley](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:998589) I found on thingiverse

With those numbers the google docs 'speed calcs' spreadsheet gives a 21mph top speed, which seems like a little too much, but whatever, I can try it, and 3D print some large pulleys with more or fewer teeth, as needed.


And also at some point (because of lead times) thinking to swap the Onda wheels for the [APS all-terrain kit](http://alienpowersystem.com/shop/cnc-kit/alien-power-system-all-terrain-transmission-kit-200x50-wheels/), or even just put them on a new board, such as this [MaxoFit Drop down](http://www.amazon.co.uk/MAXOfit-Deluxe-Longboard-Atomic-104-cm/dp/B00LW3OGIG/) which I have knocking about.

Cheers all, any comments appreciated, also posting with all those links as I found it can sometimes be tricky to work out exactly what parts someone used in a build :slight_smile:

Hi! It's Akseli from Tampere/Finland here. I just started my studies at the technical University of Tampere and I got an idea to build my own electric skateboard. Now I can get my hands on laser cutters, big 3D printers and lots of other tools that I don't even know yet. I hope there is a CNC behind some corner, lol! :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye: The hardest part so far has been choosing the right electronics for my board. If someone would be so kind as to check my parts, that are they OK? I've read quite a lot, but it may be that I understood something wrong.
Motor, [Turnigy Aerodrive SK3 Outrunner 280kV]
ESC, [HobbyKing® ™ X-Car Beast Series ESC 1:8 Scale 120A (EU Warehouse)](http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/uh_viewItem.asp?idProduct=77154)
Battery, [Turnigy Graphene Professional 8000mAh 6S 15C LiPo Pack w/XT60 (EU Warehouse)](http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/__89636__Turnigy_Graphene_Professional_8000mAh_6S_15C_LiPo_Pack_w_XT60_EU_Warehouse_.html)
Remote and receiver, Rocksta 4WS Transmitter w/Two-In-One Waterproof Receiver and ESC (EU Warehouse)

Oh, snap, I can put only 2 links to my post, so that's why I didn't link them all.

I'm not sure about the remote, ESC, and battery. Battery should be 120 Amps, but would it be better to buy two smaller mAh and bigger C value? Also I'm going with 15/30 gearing ratio.

Sup Ya'll! I go by Q IRL and I'm more or less mechanically/electrically inclined. On top of that, I also operate a small business and am pretty familiar with the importing game. First project is going to be a 2WD Electric Mountainboard. San Diego can get hot as hell and owning a car in college costs too much. Plus these things are chick magnets.

Hi all,

I'm planning on building an all terrain-esque longboard that has a top speed of roundabout 30Mph.
I thought this would be a simple case of attaching a motor to a battery and an Rc controller and just going on my way. I had no idea how complex it would be.
I've been trying to figure all this out with maths and mechanics, but I stumbled upon this forum, and I've realised I need all these battery management systems and VESCs, and it all seems to be getting very complicated.

Where can I learn more about each component that I need, its purpose, and any compatibility issues I need to be aware of?

Hey,  welcome! I felt intimidated by all the info when I looked into diy e boards, but you're really only a few hours away from understanding how to power these things. All you need to know is in these forums. I'd start off by learning about 1 component like batteries then moving on. Then start a build thread to make sure all your components fit together well :)

Hi everyone, I'm Giacomo, from Italy (I'm in Milano precisely) and I recently developed a huge love for skating my humble longboard around.
I then discovered Enertion on youtube while going through Casey Neistat videos on boosted board (he needs a helmet btw!!) and found the video of Jacob (is it his name? I don't remember) explains what parts you need to build yourself an electric skateboard for 450$.
It was late June 2016 an I thought "Wait! This is seriously cool! I need to do this!".
So i checked out the forum, i read every post, looked at every build, ordered everything I needed and got to work.
I finished my DIY motor mount mid August and since then I rode my board everywhere to the point I only take my car when I have to move heavy stuff around or need to be 100km from where I live :D
My trusty board is somehow "crude" atm and it's still work in progress ( need to design a good battery/vesc enclosure since I'm a cheapo and I don't trust my skills with fiberglass o r carbon fiber) and I think I'll go from a 6s 5000mAh to a 9s (btw i have a turnigy 245kV sk3 is that ok with a 9s? Will I fry anything on my beloved Enertion Vesc?).
I love this forum and I drool from time to time looking at those refined and perfect builds and this is making me want to improve my board till I'll find myself confortable in posting mine.
Till then I'll read and read and learn from all of you!

Hi, im Luis from Toronto Ontario 

I joined this form to learn as much as possible about electric skateboard and meet new people in the community. My goal is to learn as much as possible and hopefully build a few boards, or even start a business out of this, as this is a new way of transportation that will take over. A few things about me are that, i am mechanically inclined and, sort of a jack of all trades. Hope to meet some riders from toronto to do some rides.

My daily rider is a Yuneek E-go (not bad for a first board)

Hi, I'm Jake from Australia
I have been into esk8boarding for a while and have built 2 boards. I have only discovered this forum and have studied it for the last 2 weeks. My first board was friction drive it had a roller which rubbed against the wheel powered by a sk3 5055 280KV motor on 6s, it had a top speed of 30kph but had no torque and the wheels didn't last long and the motor got very hot. The board I have recently built has an enertion 6354 motor running on 6s which I plan on upgrading to dual drive and 14s hopefully to achieve a top speed of over 55 kp/h. I have had a lot of knowledge in RC before getting into esk8. I hope to become part of the esk8 community!

Hello all! 

I have a simple (or I assume it is at least) question that I'm having a super hard time finding an answer for online. I'm a big, fat dude. 6'2" 350+lbs. I want to ride an electric board but I'm having a rough time finding information about which board would best suit me. I reached out to the Boosted Board people and they told me they've had people my size ride their boards but they had to have a wider stance (I assume just over the wheels). Most other manufacturers stick around the 250lbs range. So I started wondering about diy kits.

Would any of you fine folks be able to suggest a solution for me? I used to skate a lot when I was younger so I'm used to the regular sized boards, I even still have my old Corey O'Brian deck from the late 80's lol. I'm totally open to a longboard experience though. Honestly, whichever handles my weight better and can run a dual motor as I'm assuming I'd need the extra juice to get around. 

Thanks so much!
Jamie

I found some longboard to buy and im interested in wheel size... can i ride smaller wheels than usual... like 75mm? 

I will follow vlad's tutorial from diy banana board and make it, but im not sure if its necessary to have 180mm and 83mm wheels if they are not available for me...

How do i calculate the belt and sprocket i need for my size?

Hey guys and girls! Been lurking for a while and done a ridiculous amount of reading on this and other forums over the last 6 months or so.
New to the whole skateboard/mountainboard scene so learning those bits as i go. Ive got a passion for bikes/cars and solid electrical background (my job) along no fear of electricity or speed :-) so naturally i ended up here!
Got myself a mountainboard and trampa trucks off ebay, motor mounts off @Nowind (beautiful bits of kit and great service/help from Jens!) and dual 6374 motors from APS. All wired up to x2 Hobbywing Max6 ESCs (my x2 vescs are sat in a bag in the bottom of my toolbox)
Im just doing the final bits like making the connectors for serial/parallel and mounting batteries and il be riding soon, hopefully at the weekend.
Cheers

Hi guys,

first of all I'd like to say that I like this forum since I don't find any haters here. That's very cool and I like the atmosphere!

I just ordered a **Quinny longboard stroller** for my wife and will convert to electric board. Focus is on range rather than speed (obviously for safety reason). Found already plenty of useful information. Might bug one or the other user ;-).

Cheers

Hi everyone,

French guy living in China,

I've been skateboarding for 10 years now and discovered the eSkate a few month ago when I arrived in China.
I've tried 2 Chinese boards that didn't last long, but that was entirely my fault as I would use them during full monsoon rain :sweat_smile: ... I'll post reviews of those very soon, so that you know everything about them (Benchwheel Dual, and Lofty Ambition Dual 90mm edition). Aniway, those boards were cheap and pretty well made, but not as powerful as I would have liked (22 km/h with a acceptable torque and 27 km/h with a very small torque).

Beeing an engineer in a FPV drone company in China, I'll have access to cheap/free parts and manufacturing, so I'd be glad to try different motors or electronic parts for you guys.

Right now I am planning a Dual Hub motor with VESC build with these motors I found on Taobao (THE chinese online store) : https://world.taobao.com/item/537737790178.htm?fromSite=main&spm=a312a.7728556.w4004-12993183284.11.OEXHQm

I'll make a topic for this but I still have a lot of things to read, especially on the Battery PCBs...

Anyway, this forum has already been a huge help in my learning process, thank you all !

Cheers

Hello!

I'm Samuel from Madrid, but currently living in Barcelona. I'm researching about building a electric skaeboard for me. I'm 90kg so i need bit of power so i think I will go for a 63mm motor. I received a crappy* pintail lingboard for my birthday and I plan use it. I like to buid things, specially with lot of LEDs in it. :slight_smile: Everithing it's better with leds (and cats). 

Barcelona it's a nice city to skate becasue it's almost flat, except some neigburhoods where i don't have the need to visit. Madrid it's the opposite to a skate-friendly city, but funny to skate, anyway. I used to cross Madrid rollerblading, but i hung the rollerblades and i switched my interest to skateboarding.

For my first build I want to priorize reach over top speed, because I live in a city, so I cannot go very fast. One friend of my local makerspacein Madrid has motirized his wheelchair and other one his kickscootter so i want to share a ride with them when visit my home city.

For next builds maybe I want explore offroad wheels, but for this one I prefer stay classy.


\* I know, there are no crappy or ugly skateboards, only noards that hasn't reived enough love.

Also Im thinking about having only one motor and one battery. Would having only one battery make the performance of the board worse besides how far I could ride it?

Thanks everyone for the welcome
Like i said, i will need help later if i don't figure out the setup for me.

My info to help: 
board preferences - longboard (specialy with the MBS wheels)
weight - 68kg
hight - 1m80
range - this is the most important, i need REAL 30km range
speed - well, i'm a fan of speed, but already have a hayabusa for that
money - it's not a problem, don't have limit, i pretend to invest according to the possibilitys, not all at once.

Every help is welcome

Sorry if it took some time between your Instagram PM and now, and also if we sound a bit promiscuous, but there's been so many boards, and so little time. Choosing the deck is sometimes the best part about assembling your skate, right?

The company is called Root Longboards. They are German, from Stuttgart, feel free to drop them a line.

Not in the 2016 lineup: http://www.rootskateboards.com/new-products/
But it can be seen here: https://www.instagram.com/p/BBS1r84OCtN/

Oops - just noticed this is the New Member thread, so to hijack a bit less: 

Hi, this is the Mellow Boards team, makers of the Mellow Drive. We believe in customization, and the DIY community is definitely at the heart of that. Ready-made e-board makers should also innovate, not just recreate, so this forum is a great place for us to hang out. 

It's sort of like a biker's bar - someplace we can talk shop, just without the Harley's.

Hey all,
My name is Sean and I have been lurking for a few weeks learning about the electric skateboarding community. I am an engineering student at UC Riverside here in cali. I am a gearhead and I like to skate as well. Seems like a good idea to meld motorsports and skating. Motorskating! 
At any rate, my plan is currently to use Lipo at 10s about 5Ah to power a single 6374 through VESC. Caliber II trucks and someones motor mount? Abecs and I need someones gear and drive. I have about 20 decks I have scoped out that I am considering and I need to pick the actual batteries and motor.  I was planning on 12s but I read a couple posts of people having issues at 12s??? So I am looking for some feedback on that.
Very pumped to stop pumping!

Hi, I'm Doug from the UK.

Just started my build. Purchased the long board and I am now researching the rest. I have good aluminium welding skills so plan to make my own mounts and weld them to the trucks.

Really keen on speaking to other UK builders to see where they have sourced their components.

Also would love to know how UK riders have got on with the law! Technically we are breaking the law by riding an electric board in a public area.

Hey I'm in the U.K. Too the law is relaxed unlike Germany so nothing to worry about.

Since you can weld it doesn't matter what trucks you get, usually you would need caliber trucks which saves you money since they cost a lot here

Wheels either get orangatang kegels or flywheels


Deck doesn't matter

3D printing can be helpful too and so can vacuum forming for enclosures 

You will need to decide on if you want dual or single motors to figure out the rest

Hey @G19Doug, I'm in the UK, also pretty new here and working on my first build, been planning it a really long time too, doing your research definitely helps, make's sure you get it right and keep your costs down as well if you do it right. ;)

as for where I sourced my components, I've bought from enertion for my battery and VESC, both were on sale when I got them, but delivery took ages (even if it was free), I got my motor from alien power systems and my wheel pulley for ABEC11 flywheels or cheap clones. My motor pulley and belt came from an online shop, UK based, I can message you links and such if it would help. I modded a GT2B myself, bit of soldering and 3D printing on my printer, can help there if you need it maybe. and finally my mount is currently being shipped over from america courtesy of @korryh, maybe you could talk to him about a mount, still cheaper than buying one anywhere else.

And as for the law, it's still pretty uncommon, and I've only seen like 2 people on boards, and they've never had a problem with it, so don't sweat! but good luck with the build dude.

I am torn between a budget single motor build and going rolls Royce twin motor! 

I was wondering if one 6355 motor will be powerful enough as then I can still have space to upgrade later to twin.

I was looking at the wheels that Alien Power sell. £39 for a set is the most reasonable price I have seen for a set.

Which motor did you choose from Alien power? 

I think I will purchase my VESC from SCRAM boards as they are UK based. 

With the value of the pound dropping so dramatically parts have just got a whole lot more expensive!

I figure if my board does 25 mph I should be able to outrun the law! :smile:

Hey everyone, my name is Ethan. I am 14 years old and recently (start of October) decided it would be crazy fun to make an electric longboard. I have been researching a ton and have slowly compiled a list of parts. My goal is to create a somewhat affordable/cheap board open for customization and upgrades. I want to slowly upgrade and fix whatever problems I have to one day get my dream board (which I sort of hope never happens). I need my board to travel back and forth from school, and go up and down hills.  So far, I am hovering around $400, and I hope to get it under that. I've honestly never done anything like this, but I am taking it slow and learning a lot. It's been a lot of fun so far and I hope start ordering parts soon.

I have a more detailed plan on Google Sheets that I will show on a separate thread I think, but here is a rough idea of what I'm doing:

245KV Turnigy SK3 Motor
2 3S 5000mah batteries
120A ESC
Custom Motor Mount Clamp
54 Tooth Pulley
36 Tooth Wheel Pulley
18 Tooth Motor Pulley

If anyone has any comments or suggestions, please feel free to reply.
Thanks in advance!

Hello eSk8 world!  I'm Sage. 40 something year old truck driver. I own my own truck and run it as my business (Owner Operator). I want to build a longbboard for travel to/from the truck and around whatever city I end up in, it will be my traveling transportation!

Been reading A LOT! Finally decided on some parts, then saw @jwoodsentertainment had to sell his parts before even building it, so I shall carry on the dream!

[quote="jwoodsentertainment, post:487, topic:216"]
Board - blank drop deck
Wheels - 97mm flywheels authentic
Bearings - bones Swiss ceramic
Motor - dual 190kv 6355 (stealth group buy) 
ESC - chaka's vesc with heat sink
Battery - 12s 3p 45c lipo to start 12s 5p custom pack once all kinks are worked out
Motor mount - torque board v4's
[/quote]
13/36 gearing

However, I will start out with 8s lipo (for safety's sake) and upgrade later to 12s.

So excited to start building and looking forward to input on my build post (upcoming).

Hello from Scotland!

I'm Fin, just discovering this community and I'm super glad it exists! Long boarding was my go to as a teenager, sadly my boards now gather dust thanks to my car. I've been trying to wrap my head around what is in involved in building an esk8 to get me back into it, Jason's YouTube videos have been invaluable (you should definitely be plugging them more in beginners threads!)

 I worked in electronics for years, so the mark up (and design) of a boosted board made my stomach churn.  I have a loaded vanguard so it's time to make a better one myself!!

Just joined and hoping to get some help in building an electric mountainboard.
Have been building multicopters for a while but want to see if I can build something else which might make my daily commute easier.

Right now Im thinking about an MBS 90X board but I'm having trouble finding any gears / beltdrives and motor mounts for it.

Any tips on what to look for are very appreciated ;)

Hi 
Just joined I am making a electric longboard for my self as part of a engineering projects at college. Could use some help from the community. I will be making the board and mounting bracket myself.

I will be using a 
Turnigy Aerodrive SK3 - 6364-245kv 
Turnigy 5000mAh 3S 20C Lipo x3
HK-GT2B 3CH 2.4GHz Transmitter (will change to a wii in time)

Was going to get the new VESC, Is it worth it? Or just get a ESC, as the VESC only a 60A

I will be using 90mm wheels. 

Not sure about the gears/beltdrives? 
If the parts are any good?

Thanks
Any help will be appreciated.

Hey eSk8 community!

I'm a 19 year old aspiring eSk8 builder and I'm here to ask you for some advice regarding my board that I'm planning to create over the course of this winter!
My plan:

- **Dual motor** (I know the price difference, but I want the grip, the aesthetics, the thrust)
- Medium range of arround **12-14km** 
- **Topspeed that's high enough** to keep me from wanting more even after a while of riding on it, even on straight bike roads, that might be more helpful for you than an amateur throwing with a stupid number around him.
- Strong torque for my low weight of **65kg** (187m in case that is relevant) that will master any reasonable angle sovereignly and without problems.
- Likewise, good breaking power for my weight.
- A good mix between **stability and maneuverability**
- A fairly beginner friendly build that will keep me satisfied as I learn.
- A healthy mix between **quality and price** for an amateur, with room for **customization** (e.g.: Indicators/lights, swappable batteries for longer trips, other electronics), this is probably guaranteed though due to the DIY factor ;)


More information:
- I live in an **urban environment** with medium hillage (is that even a word), but I also want it to be fun and mobilizing in less restricting, isolated and flat environments (think inter-village bike way)
- I'm looking to seriously use and care for the board daily
- Surprisingly, I am trying to stay rather low on the price. A rough number would be **650** **€** , that ends up as **800** **€**



----------


I have the collected the **basic information** from this site and @onloops YT regarding boards, electronics, components, motor setup, transmission and I am a quiet experienced DIY-er, but **my weakest point is probably programming and component balancing** (knowing what to buy to not waste potential).

Now I need your experience and knowledge to help me find the right components while considering the points I named above, **I need concrete advice on which products to buy** (except the board)
, the given list on this forum is great but it do but I still don't exactly know what goes best with what to maximize efficiency, durability, power and reliability and all that good stuff.



----------


Other concrete short questions:
- Can I program an indicator/light switch onto a remote controller like the eSk8 mikro remote?
- Can I use only one remote/receiver for the two VESC's/Motors?
- What else do I need to consider for dual motors?
- How important is the no spark or the battery charger regulator thingy? Are there more small electronic components I should look into? How does the electronic circuit change for dual motors/more batteries?
- Do we have free will?

I would be endlessly thankful if someone would take the time to answer these questions!
Cheers,
Gero

Greetings!

I'm about to jump into the deep end on this project.  Building the VESC/SparkSwitch from scratch - seems pretty straight-forward.  Starting with these bones:

[board](https://www.amazon.com/Rimable-Bamboo-Through-Longboard-Polynesian/dp/B019F01O96/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1478231970&sr=8-2&keywords=rimable+longboard)

I took the trucks and mounted them to the bottom of the board - don't think this is the best idea in the world.  Probably going to cut a aluminum spacer to fill/support the hole that's left.  Might work, we'll see.  New deck may be in order.

wheels - a set of kegels

batteries - (3) 5000mAH 4s30C in series to get up to 12s.  Foregoing an on-board BMS out of laziness - maybe later

motor - can't decide between turnigy SK3 6374 190kV, diy electric skateboard 6374 190kV and the ollin OM506 200kV.  I'd like hall sensors for FOC, but I'm not entirely sure that I'd really wind up using that feature.

Drive bits (36T/13T) from diyelectric skateboard, but I'll cut my own motor mount.  

Last but not least, need to control this thing.  At this point thinking Badwolf GT2B controller, but the wii nunchuck still has some appeal.

Am I forgetting anything?  I don't think so...  If I did, let me know - always looking for feedback!

Thanks in advance for any comments recommendations!  I'll open a build log thread once the VESC parts show up.

Hey Guys, 

New to the E-Board game, currently gathering the parts for my 1st build. Looking to build something to commute in my hilly area instead of using my bike. Distances will be less than 5miles mostly, but there will be very little flat ground in those commutes, **Advice would be greatly appreciated**. 

My Parts Bin so far is: 

- Lush Grifter 3D Board (35.5" x 9.9" with 27" wheelbase)
- x2 VESC (from VESC.co.uk)
- Alien Power Systems Dual Motor 63mm Drive
- Alien Power Systems 190kv 6355 motors (2)
- Paris V2 Trucks
- APS Remote & Reciever
- orangatang 80mm wheels

now trying to workout the power supply. 

Thoughts so far are: 
x3 Mulitstar 4s 10000mah LIPOs - 12S system 
and using xt60's to make a series chain and and xt90 to link to the VESC's with an XT90 as a power key to turn on/off. 

Charging i was going to use a Turingy Accucell 6 and charge the LIPOs in series (i was thinking of using XT60 parallel splitters on each Multistar pack to have a series chain to the VESCs (via the power key) and a parallel chain linked to a balance charge board and another exterior mounted xt60 connector & Balance lead. 

Any wrong thinking in my plan? 

Thanks in advance for all your advice. 

OATBMB

Hi,
I built my first eboard two years ago with a single 245kv motor, the good old HK 120A ESC and a 6s 5000mah battery with a custom 3d printed enclosure.
I was very happy with my setup but I broke the battery last month because I discharged it too low. The low voltage cutoff of the ESC worked, but I restarted the board to finish my trip (my ESC doesn't detect the low voltage for ~5min when I do that, don't ask me why...) and... I put the board aside for 2days before recharging it.
Of course, one of my cells died in this time and I couldn't do anything to save it...

It's a good opportunity to start a new board, especially with all the news improvements made by this community.
I'm currently building my deck with integrated battery and electronics. It's a 2cm thick deck made from plywood panels and the goal is to have nothing outside this deck.
The battery is a 6s 5000mah(enough for my use) homemade (<1cm thick).
For the ESC, it's going to be a V-ESC( I need to check the diameter of these big caps before to see if they fits in my deck).
And the motor will be a Torque single hub. I think it may be good, because I weight 70kg(155lbs) and I'm riding only on flat ground with moderate speed(20-30km/h).

I will create a build post and show some pics when I have more time.

hi there all...my name is bernard, im from from South Africa!
so im really hooked on this new found interest that is electronic sk8boarding...i think i might of found myself a new hobby!

i already own a couple of longboards and love skateboarding, i used to skate street when i was younger and more supple...but now im in my 30's and enjoy cruizing rather. 

i use my longboard often for commuting to work and crossfit gym......  i have to say, im blown away by this idea of motorizing skateboards! i never knew that there are actual hobby motors to deliver such torque.. 

so on the topic of torque and speed that these motors can deliver... i weigh in at just 90 kg's.

i really want to build my own drivetrain on my existing board... sooooo my first question is...am i too heavy??? im not fat so i cant lose any weight, or i guess maybe i can shed a kilo or two.... am i doomed?

looking forward for any advice..thanks
cheeeeers!

Hi!
So, my name is Federico, im from Argentina and planing a trip to US in a few weeks.
Trying to build my first eboard this is what its in my budget.
I think its ok, still I have some doubts about the power consumption of the motor and the power gives by the batteries.
The motor says 8S-10S, and with two of those batteries in serie i have 6S 5000mAh, 30C.

Hi, I'm Will from Los Angeles. 
This past summer I built an electric penny board, to help get me around town and take me to class in college.
Here's my parts list and specs:

ESC: VESC

Motor: Turnigy Aerodrive SK3 - 6374-192kv Brushless Outrunner Motor (way too much power, only running it at half power right now)

Batteries: 2 4s Turnigy Nano-Tech 4500 mah in series.

Wheels: 76mm ABEC 11 flywheels

Belt and pulleys: 36T ABEC Pulley Combo Kit from 

Controller: TorqueBoards 2.4ghz Nano Remote Controller

Motor Mount: Custom Made, as I could not find one that fits penny boards

Specs: 
Top Speed: 19.5 mph
Range: 7.5 miles (this was on a mix of 15 to 20 degree hills and flat ground)
Hill Steepness: 20 degree hills no problem, haven't tried anything steeper than that

I'm currently trying to improve top speed by potentially switching to 9s, or swapping 13T motor pulley for 16T
Also trying to find a better motor mount solution as the one I have is shaky and by far the most unreliable part of the board.

Hello folks,
I have done my reading and searching now and it would be great if someone could just take a look at my build list to see if my parts synergize well:

- 2 VESCs
http://goaxle.com/shop-1/vesc-412-vedders-speed-control or from world.taobao.com

- 2 MAYTECH 190 KV motors https://world.taobao.com/item/536646046389.htm?spm=a312a.7700714.0.0.MbJpZD

- Batteries: 3x 5000mah 25C 4S1P  LiPo's (total 44.4v)__
https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-5000mah-4s-25c-lipo-pack.html

- Ebay Board: Maybe this or one with a similar shape:
http://ebay.to/2eP81Db

- AlienPowerSystem 2 Trucks, 4 83mm 78a Wheels, 8 Bearings, 2 Transmissions (15-32, 9mm), 2 Mounts (maybe DIY)
http://alienpowersystem.com/product-category/cnc-kit/

- WINNING nano remote/receiver

I know some other things, especially cables, battery charging stuff, tape, possible lights, buttons, screens and so on are missing, but I can figure that out later without much advice.

Now some questions regarding my build:

- Do these batteries go well with my motors? (I'm 65kg, got some decent hills here, want to achieve around 10-15km range, they wont fry my motors/vescs will they under proper care?)

- Gearing Ratio: I want primarily good torque, and secondly I was aiming for around 40km/h, so because of my 2 pretty powerful motors, medium-lowish wheel diameter, my high voltage and my low weight I thought I could go a bit lower on the gearing ratio to achieve higher top speeds. What do you think? Or should I just go for the classic 15/36?

Thanks in advance, I would be really thankful if someone could share some experience here.
Greetings
ACIN

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Edit**: Okay so I just found out thanks to @NickTheDude that I should run 10S instead of 12S, and that my range should  be well over my wanted 12-14km under my 10S*5Ah=185Wh Setup ( ~~~> 18km range).


**Still wondering though if my 15/32 Gearing and my 83mm wheels will transform enough of that ridiculous torque I'm getting from my dual 190kv motors (under 10S) into topspeed. I want it well balanced.**

To get your top speed use this calculator http://calc.esk8.it Common gear ratios you can buy are 36/16, 36/15 and 36/13 so I'd check those out and choose whichever top speed you want. I'm pretty sure your going to have enough torque regardless though.

@ACIN how much power (watts) do those motors put out? The page is in Chinese so I can't read the specs. The power of the motors will help determine which gear ratio you should use to get the best balance of top speed and torque.

@pennyboard It's the same motor as the enertion 6355 motor: 2400W (Just less than half the price ;) ). I thought it is fairly popular on the forum.


@NickTheDude  I know about the calculators, the thing is if I set it to give me the ideal topspeed - say 40 km/h, I still don't know if the torque will be high enough. It doesn't tell me if the torque is well balanced with speed in relation to my weight.

That is why I was asking for some human experience to give me a rough estimate of how I should set my transmission.

Anyway my proposed setup (10S 83mm 190kv 15/32 80% Efficiency) gives me a topspeed of 41.24 km/h, and as I said I'm not sure if I should give up on some topspeed here for torque.

So what does your experience fed intuition say?

Thanks for the help!

I figure you'll have a ton of torque with even a 50km/h top speed. I don't think you'll be needing to go that fast though. Dual 190s on 10S should be beastly, especially at your weight.

Hi there,

I'm a new forum member from Germany. I used to own an Evolve Gen2 Bamboo Board. I was very into it, but also noticed the downsides of not knowing the insides of the board, plus the really bulky motor at the back.

Now I am planning my own build.

This is my plan:
Get a battery: http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/also-usa-10s4p-samsung-25r-190/12458/1
Get the Carvon 2.5 (Would actually like the v3 but since they are not released yet... Also, I am unsure of whether to get the dual or single version)
Get the Carvon vesc/s
Get the Enertion remote
Get an enclosure (maybe an Ikea box for starters)
Use my old Atom deck for test purposes

When that works, my further plan is to:
Build my own deck similar to this one: http://imgur.com/a/z4ZAK
One big thing I don't like about that is the missing  flex and concave (so actually two things).

Any help/suggestions/warnings are welcome.
```

Hello!

I'm obviously new here :slight_smile:
There are couple of reasons why I decided to join this community...
1. I live in Croatia and and it's too poor and too "far away" country to be interesting to any of the manufacturers or to have delivery to. I mean I could probably maybe order BB and do some voodoo magic delivery with mail forwarding service. But the prices on that are ...significant.
2. I'm not into making the fastest or the best esk8 because I I'm not that into "POWER". Main purpose of my board would be commute to/from work. I just need something to get me to work in under 30 min so I don't have to deal with the public transport.
3. Spare parts. Again, living in Croatia means that I can't simply send my esk8 to someone to fix it. Either I do it myself or that's it. So If I'm already counting on making the repairs myself - I need to know what is it made of and where to get spare parts. 
4. Price isn't that much of a problem. But if I can save on shipping then why not.
5. I'm in the mood for new hobby. :slight_smile: 
6. I will love it even more if I build it myself. And it will be pink and girly and unicorny because that's the real HC stuff :two_hearts: :joy:

So... please forgive any beginner questions because I'm almost blank page when it comes to esk8s. For now I think I'm gonna go and read everything written here, before I start buying/building anything

Hello. My name is Keenan, and I'm stoked that this community is organized on a forum rather than a fb group - so much easier to keep track of threads. I used to contribute often to silverfishlongboarding.com ~ 10 years ago when I was first getting into "longboarding", which was around the last time I researched eboards. Since then I became a semi-serious downhill slalom skateboard racer, my friends became manufacturers (rollingtree.net), and clearly eboard tech has come a long way. I live in a city and have been tinkering with vintage 2 stroke pedal mopeds, dirt bikes and motorcycles the last few years, which has cut into my skating time. I began noticing older fellows in my neighborhood riding sondors ebikes and some properly quick electric scooters, which restoked my interest in electric skateboards.

So, I pulled the trigger on an Acton S2 yesterday. I'd considered a faster board, but my commute is fairly short and I have other transport options (moped, scooter, motorcycle) for longer journeys.. or I can go hit a local DH run if I just wanna go fast. The high profile nature of blasting down the busy bikepath I'm close to also played a part in my decision, bicyclists are rather militant in my area so don't want to push my luck (iirc 20 mph is the limit for allowable EV's on the paths).

Hi, my name is Brad from Perth, Western Australia.

**Introduction to the world of ESK8**

I first started looking into ESK8's in April earlier this year because I wanted a fun portable way to commute that would also allow me to board a bus and store it in the work truck toolbox and an electric skateboard fit the bill. 

The first board I looked into was Marbel, but thankfully I was not able to get one at the time so I started researching in various options and realized that I dodged a bullet with Marbel.

I have never ever skateboarded in my entire life and had to start for the first time on an Evolve bamboo GT. Was literally a baby in regards to boarding skills but I managed to get competent enough to be able to ride up to 40km/h (Full charge and downhill) with out any issues after about 8 weeks on AT wheels.

**Growing interest in DIY**

However I really want a board to my taste which means flexy board with custom adjustments but did not really look into DIY options as the image I had of that sphere was mostly just hacked together items from radio controlled car/planes and a fishing tackle box that housed the BMS/ESC/battery just duct taped onto the board.

After some reading on [eSk8](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders), I started to understand that it is not the case anymore. Ackmaniac's [BLDC-TOOL](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/extended-bldc-tool-with-watt-control-mode-ppm-cruise-control-and-individual-throttle-curve/12286) was such a great read and combined with [BBMS](http://raphaelchang.com/projects/bms/) (12 cells all up max or 12 cell pack that can then be put in serial with more 12 cell packs? I still have more reading to do!) and [DIY 6s to 12 s BMS with CAN](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/diy-6s-to-12s-bms-with-can/2639/67), has convicted me that going DIY is the way to go for the ultimate personally tailored board.

I have managed to make some spreadsheet with equations for battery pack set up (volts,amp,c and so on), wheel size speed rpm required for a set km/h speed and the needed rpm for the motor pulley with the teeth number input. 

Also to work out the 4th teeth size or rpm information with just 3 known information in relation to one large and one small pulley via belt drive. I did it this way as it teaches me how the math works and therefore have a better understanding.

Thanks to the spreadsheets I built, I wish to cap the max speed at 40km/h and worked out that 15t motor pulley will need to have an rpm cap of 5253 (rounded) to set the limit that the 97mm wheel with 36t drive hub can go at 40km/h. 

If it cannot hit 40km/h that is fine, but I will know how much to cap it when changing pulley sizes.

**My DIY plan**

It is a work in progress. It might be stretched over six months as I'm in no hurry and still have some more reading to do.

What I have now

**Planned Fabrication**

Battery compartment. I was inspired by [Buffalo's](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/685366706/worlds-1st-single-dual-motor-switchable-electric-s/description) flexible battery compartment and found that it is silicone based. I will try my hand in making a mould to create myself a silicone battery compartment of the right size. Baffalo's is a bit too small.

However I plan to buy their battery compartment and ESC box separately. Do not want their board at all.

**Not decided**

* Remote and Reciever
* Battery config - Thinking about going 12s4p or 12s3p (I want to build it myself, so no [pre-builts](https://hobbyking.com/en_us/batteries/turnigy-lipoly.html))
* Type of battery to use
* BMS
* ESC
* Charger

I will make a new thread when I begin to build my first personal flexy eSk8. Stay tuned!

Hi, Scott from Queensland, Australia.

First e Board and only my second long board after buying one just 2 months ago. 

My first build is as follows:

 - Bustin Maestro Pro Deck
 - Enertion monodrive mechanical kit (wheels, trucks, pulleys, motor mount, belt 12mm)
 - SK3 6374 192 kv motor
 - Enertion VESC X 
 - Enertion Nano X controller
 - 3 x 3S1P 8000mAh LiPO
 - Hopefully custom enclosures if I can build the frame and produce some thermo formed abs 

Main worry I have is motor/VESC setup and the BLDC vs FOC quandry.

Thanks for reading

Hi All,

New member here in Portsmouth in the south of England UK.

I have been lurking for a week or two and I am now about to start a build so thought I'd say hi!

I have a donor Longboard nothing special its an Urban Blue pin tail, but its fairly stiff, which I am planning to use to start with. I will buy some new trucks and attach the batteries, electronics etc in a box which will be attached by velcro for the first few runs as I am unsure about my riding skills.

I am an electro-mech engineer but my access to workshops and all the tools for this sort of personal job will be limited, so I will most like likely buy a mount.

If I like riding it (well can do it) I have a few ideas about custom enclosures and maybe different deck, extra electronics such as BMS and ON/OFF Switch etc to replace anti-spark loop key. I just don't want to spend loads of money and not get on with it. Plus i thought probably best to keep it simple to start.

I will create a build thread as I have a few questions. Typical things about best options for a UK/EU build :slight_smile: 

Thanks!

Hello everyone!  I am from Central Arkansas, now living in Rochester, New York going to graduate school at Rochester Institute of Technology.  (I haven't seen anyone else from the area, so if you're from WNY, hit me up!) A couple of guys built an electric longboard during my undergraduate senior design which was my first and only experience with them.  Like many of you, Casey Neistat was my inspiration to build my own after seeing his BB.  

I am an avid hobbyist and drone enthusiast as well as a DIY tinkerer through and through.  I actually became interested in electric boards because of the implications they have over traditional transportation. I am getting a Master of Science in Sustainable Systems here at RIT and I was drawn to these lovely boards because of their versatility while maintaining zero emissions at the point of use...the implications are endless.  Before I left Arkansas, I sold my car and have been carpooling, bicycling, walking, and running to get around here.  

I have already purchased my build which can be seen here:
[http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/arbor-axis-maple-aps-6374-240kv-tb-vesc-8s-6ah-lipo-tb-single-mount-kit-caliber-ii-50s-abec-83mm-aps-remote/14217](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/arbor-axis-maple-aps-6374-240kv-tb-vesc-8s-6ah-lipo-tb-single-mount-kit-caliber-ii-50s-abec-83mm-aps-remote/14217)
 I plan on jumping head first into it over the Winter Break before I plan to use the board on a daily basis to commute to and around campus while I finish my degree here next semester.  Further, I plan to document my rides and use this data for research, but more on that in a later post.  So thanks for the help already and I look forward to working with everyone as both my own and your build(s) progress!

Hi! I am a new member. After about 2 days of nonstop lurking the forums, I have decided to go DIY. 
I want to build a board for street riding. I want a Loaded Vanguard deck with orangatang wheels. Also, I want the top speed to be between 20-30 mph and have a range of more than 15 miles. Please help!
I need help to decide on battery and motors and have a few questions:
1. Is more kV better? Is 200 good or should I look for more?
2. How can I measure my range? Whats the slimmest/good battery life option?

THANKS!

New member in Melbourne Australia. Just putting together the pieces of my first build. Just picked up a cheap longboard deck from gumtree, looks like a cheap ebay job, no branding. Have 2nd hand R Spec 2 6355 190Kv, 2nd hand enertion pully/belt set and have ordered a Nano-x and Vesc-X from Enertion (still waiting on delivery) and in the meantime am trying to understand batteries and BMS. Guessing I am also going to need to work out a motor mount, learn how to solder and order all of the safety gear. Looking for someone in a similar situation to stumble through this kind of project with!

Hi everyone! New to the board.

I brought a prebuilt board back in August from scramboards..com or should i say scamboards, and its never worked, its gone about 10 meters before cutting out. So im here to try and learn and see how i can fix the board myself as the company are no longer responding to my emails. 

The forum looks great, and some really great builds here :)

Hi :) New member from Oslo, Norway.

I started riding skateboard when i was about 8 years, and got my first longboard when I was 23, 2 years ago. Now Im gonna buy a electric skateboard. Not really sure if Im gonna buy the dual motors kit from Enertion or make something on my own. It would be more expensive to make it diy. If someones got questions about Lipo or something else. Just ask. Im glad to help.

I've been doing the rc hobby for about 6 years. There's a lot of vehicles in my collection.
The list is:
7 cars. Traxxas Slash and Summit, Axial SCX10, Wraith, Custom SCX10-axle 8x8, Yeti XL, Tamiya M-03.
2 tracked vehicles. Kyosho Blizzard DF-300 EP and Custom project dual Blizzard like the Swedish Hägglunds BV206.
2 planes. Horizon Extra 300 and a Super Cub.
1 boat. Cant remember the make, but its small. Not more than 30 cm long. It got a small BL motor.
7 drones. DJI Naza custom frame 1000mm, Dji phantom v1.1 with custom hatch that can be opened remotely in the air, Dji phantom 2 with drone racer electronics, Hubsan X4, 250 size drone for racing, 190 size drone for racing and a small very powerful 150 size drone for racing.
I have a lot of experience from Lipo-batteries. I have a lot of them too, The smallest is 1s 500mah and the biggest is 6s 10Ah.
I have a messy YT-channel where I post videos from time to time. You can find some of my projects there. 
I dont earn any big money from youtube yet, just a little bit a month from the commercials at my videos :)

Hi all,

I've decided to build my own Skateboard and found this place.  I've seen a few people with the Boosted Boards and think they're a great idea.  In some cities it makes more sense to have something like an electronic skateboard as opposed to a car.  I make a short trip to my local gym every other day and this skateboard will be perfect. 

I seen the Boosted board was £500 and immediately wondered what the build quality was like.  I looked around on YouTube and although that company seems okay I think I'd prefer to build my own.  I want the HUB motors, not a belt drive.  I want at least 30mph and lots of range.  I knew to get those things I'd need to build my own.  For the added performance and reliability I'll happily pay more.

I came across a video on Youtube of Scott Kellum talking about his board.  Very impressed by it and I'm looking to build something similar.  I'd be happy to follow Scott's guide but I did see him say a new V3 version of the wheels he used will be out soon.  If that's the case I'll wait until their released.  Meantime I can work on a board and there's some great ideas for that one here.  I'm confident I can build something better than any after market product.  I just need to research the best parts and then get down to ordering them.

Hiya

I'm from the Bay Area, and my board happens to be a Carbon GT for those hills here. But this was before I even knew that DIY board forums existed. So I have been lurking for awhile and decided to make an account on this forum. The copious amounts of info and data on this forum rocks and I'm having a blast learning the ins and outs of e-boarding.

In the future I'm planning on re-purposing and modifying the Evolve to ... Un-Evolve it. :P I'll decide that when the battery starts dying on me. So in the mean time, just going to enjoy the board as is and start decide on parts to retrofit this sucker.

Cheers!

Hey there!

I'm new to both forums and electric longboards. Planning to build my own in the next months. I realize it's a lot of work, so I'm trying to do a lot of research and trying to make sure I buy the right parts right away.

To help myself in the process, I "wrote" a little excel tool to help me decide what to do.

Basically you input data about: motor, battery, board (wheels, pulleys) and it outputs maximum velocity, range and others.

So...my first post will be a contribution to the community. There you go:

http://www.filedropper.com/showdownload.php/e-board

Now if you want to help me :) (thank you!) you could tell me what parts I should buy to make a built with:

a top speed of 40 km/h
a range of 13+km
With a guy of 80kg on top.

I'm not sure if a 270kv 2000W single motor will do.
Also: a single motor will cause the board to "turn automatically", right?
Aaaand last but not least. The battery. 8000mAh, 20C ? 

I realize there is a lot more to know. Like...how the hell does a VESC work :D


But at this stage, any help is of great value.


Thank you and enjoy! Let me know what you think of the excel!


Cheers,

Matt

Well, here goes.

I'm really interested in building a board but first I have to learn to skate on one (had a board when I was a kid, was kind of useless with it).

I'm now approaching 35 and decided, yeah, why not. Let's be totally ridiculous and attempt to not only learn how to skate, but do it at higher speed than usual! (But at least I'll have brakes, right?)

My plan is to get a longboard and learn while slowly getting together the parts to add the motorised components.
Then when I have everything together I should have a decent feel of how the thing travels.

I plan to use the Pi Zero to control my board, does anybody else use one of these?

I have a background in electronics and am an electronic engineer by trade, so I have a great deal of knowledge in electronics and electrical components. I wil try to add that knowledge to the board as and wehn I can contribute.

Hello,
I am a new member. I have been researching on line (YouTube) and following this forum for the past year or so. I have a 41" Globe Pinner that I will convert to electric. I swapped out the trucks for Caliber II 50's and stock wheels for 83mm Flywheel clones. Added 1/2 inch spacers and moved trucks to bottom (drop thru). I have some RC gear that I am going to use to cut down on overall cost (Traxxas Transmitter/Receiver/charger). I ordered motor, motor mount & belt/pulley kit from Enertion (in the mail). I already have 2 - 2S Lipo's and ordered a 3rd for 6S power. I already got some good  information about building the "series" wiring harness from some of the guys on this forum. Once I get further along I might add plastic or metal plugs/covers for drop thru holes in board, add on/off switch & volt meter mounted on top for use as fuel guage. I will also be purchasing a VESC from Enertion as well. I am looking into Plano 3600 waterproof box for batteries, VESC, etc. That's all for now. Here is a pic of my starting point.

I'm Leroy from Georgia. 
I've been riding skateboards for 30 years. 
I rode half pipes and pools and water drainage systems until I turned 30 and then I did mostly street , with a focus on downhill slides. 

I've never owned a helmet, the only equipment I have ever used were knee pads on vert, and 2x4 wood blocks nailed to the palms of work gloves for sliding. 

I bought a benchwheel and that metal beam makes it ride like a log.
 I took the parts and stuck them on an  32" Arbor deck, now it's a lot of fun.... as long as tape holds. 

 Sparks go flying.

Since the photo,
 I've  removed all that tape, 
and switched to black gorilla tape, 
it makes it look really classy :)

The alligator clip/fuse holder kind of melted, so I replaced it with that silicone wire. 

I know very little about electricity and electrics, 

I'm a software guy, I write code.

I came here looking for new wheels and stuff. 
I figure y'all have all the cool trick parts.

Hey @spaso,
I am in the stage where I receive the components for my first build right now. I have done a lot of research in the last 4 months and will most likely go for Carvon motors too.

I just wanted to tell you that Carvon is working on new "hubs" (carvon v3) right now, which will have the advantage compared to V2.5 that you can easily swap out the wheels (which can then have thick urethane, motor is next to wheel, not in the wheel). They may also be a bit more powerful and cost 500$ on presale, only 100$ more compared to the 400$ you pay for the single V2.5 you suggested (which will really lack torque). (Infolink: http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/carvon-v3-closer-than-everyone-thinks/13119/65)

There are also many other new Hub models from other companies coming out this year which you may want to consider, **here's a quick overview**:

- **Enertion Hubs**: These 90mm "R-SPEC GHOST Hub Motors" will take probably around 7 months to come out as a single item, not sure yet. Right now it seems like they will have sick torque, a medium top speed (42 kph), they also look sick and will be sensored (the vesc knows in which position the motor is :arrow_right: smoother/stronger start). Their KV rating may change though towards a more top speed oriented motor though. (Infolink: http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/raptor-2-most-powerful-direct-drive-electric-skateboard-kickstarter/12694/604)

- **Hummie's Beasts**: Hummie is bringing his new 90mm * **101mm** (yes you heard that right) wide hub motor beasts. These should be out by late spring and will just be insanely powerful, they are supposedly basically as strong as 4 old hummie hubs (steelhubs). Not sure how much the turning radius will be limited by this but they look promising. Hummies are also known for extreme durability and low prices, especially compared to Carvonskates, who often are pretty overpriced. (Infolink: http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/the-nicest-hub-motors-for-sale-cheaper-than-anywhere/1002/1137)

- **Torqueboards** is also supposedly making new hubs within the next few months with a 220mm wide hanger, 40mm axle (caliber II style) and a "huge" hub motor. Not much info here yet but a wide truck will give you a very stable ride.
(Source: http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/whats-the-best-motor/8712/33?u=acin)

- **EMF** (Jacobhubs): I haven't heard anything about new hubs right now from him. His old ones are generally pretty powerful but they have urethane slippage issues. I don't think they can keep up with what the others are brewing up though.

----- 
This is AFAIK the hub motor situation right now, I wouldn't recommend cheap chinese hubs. Carvon V2.5 are great hubs, I just wanted to inform you that it might be worth to wait a bit since its winter right now anyway.

So go through the links and think about what you are looking for: More Value? More Torque? More Top Speed? More Adaptability? More Durability? More Stability? More Maneuverability?

It's all out there in 2017, a great year for hub motors - the future of esk8s. :wink:

When can I post a new thread? I have a question about my VESC cutting out (I'm running sk3 280kv with a 6s and vesc), my VESC flashes red six times when I get on and try to ride it. I cant even ride it and I don't get any errors in BLDC. It goes when there is no load on it but only for 5 seconds of acceleration before it cuts out. Also how do I change the throttle range? Nothing has worked when changing in BLDC for throttle range for me yet.

Hey @ACIN

Thanks so much!

I have looked into most of these hubs and still I've chosen the V2.5's because as an all around motor they seem really great.  Also, I talked to Jerry from carvon and he said the V2.5 will be better torque wise then the V3's.  The V3's wheel switching looks awesome, but since I would be getting the wheels I want (ABEC 11 90mm) on the V2.5's it isn't a big deal to me. Of course, many of these hubs look sick and if I'm ever interested in upgrading my e-board, which I probably will be, I might check out Hummie's Beasts just to have more torque for awesome hill climbing.  But yeah, looks like a really awesome year for hub motors and e-boards. Also, I saw in a video that the Enertion Hubs will not come to market as a separate item, and if they will, it won't be anytime soon.

Best,
Nick

Hi, I'm starting a build but I wanted to use a penny board because I like their size. I've read a lot and realized that most people think that's a bad idea so I bought a nickel board to use. I really like the design. Now I read on here that I should use 83mm wheels but the nickel uses 59mm. I really like the wheels, they match the board nicely. Is it really that awful to use that size? And if I size up to I need risers or anything like that? <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/1/9/19704115684f71a9d0bca19d0476525b1753a2ce.jpg" width="362" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/0/2/023321f8f0e7efce2cc245087f942bae571fb822.jpg" width="371" height="500">

You're going to run into issues with mounting a pulley on the wheel. You could drill holes in the wheel yourself, but most of the wheel pulley solutions are designed for flywheel clones. 83mm is the smallest size I've seen them in. You might also have some trouble finding a mount that works for those trucks since most of them are designed for Caliber II trucks.

Thanks for your quick response. So I was hoping I could just drill holes in the wheels since I've seen that done before. But now I see you also don't think my trucks would work... 😢. I'm actually a 5'5 120lb female so I like to keep things light and small for convenience. I don't need it to go horribly fast. I want to use it as a city cruiser since I'm in Philadelphia a lot and you can't really park there. I also have an arduino exploration I want to customize for the controller and was curious of I could use it with Bluetooth. And per your advice, I should change the wheels and trucks?

**to be honest i probably shouldn't even be here**. i have basically no need for an electric skateboard right now (i commute to work in the middle of massachusetts) but the idea is a full-on brain worm at this point. If i move to silicon valley or detroit for my dream job of automotive software R&D then i'll be in a great place for one but..

for now, i'm itching to do some torture tests of 3d printed parts like motor mounts and pulleys, but printed out of taulmann bridge, extremely tough nylon. It doesn't print pretty but the parts are SUPER strong. Once i upgrade my delta to a larger size and enclose it, i'll have all the hardware needed to print nylon well.
**current plan**: make a bench test setup, get some trucks and wheels and a motor, power the whole thing using a PSU of some kind, and just let it run for hundreds of hours and see what it does to the nylon.

eventually i'd love to go totally custom, make my own battery pack, mounts, enclosures, maybe even the board if any makerspaces nearby has the bits for making carbon fiber sheets, toss a decal of my choosing on the bottom as well.

**i should really visit my local skate shop..**

Hey, cool. I'm new here too. Maybe you can use your 3d skills to help out folks like me for a small fee. I'd love a printed motor mount. They are expensive to buy from enertia boards site...

Hey! My name is Pontus and Im from Sweden.
Skated abit when I was younger, kinda miss it. 
Came across electric skateboards and my jaw dropped, was gonna buy one but I love having projects and as Im currently studying(System developer) and have some spare time and vacations I decided to start my own electric skateboard build. Was supposed to be a super-budget one but got to hyped and ordered some more expensive parts.

Anyway, its about to get done, just waiting on some things I ordered for my enclosures and charger/woodinserts and capacity display.
I actually have a thread about it here on this forum. 

Cant wait to take it out! :smiley:

i'm not going to offer up prints unless i can do some torture testing on nylon parts and find them to be comparable in strength and wear resistance to aluminum. I think things get really murky legally when you're printing something and then selling the print, since like on thingiverse there's implied copyright on all objects on there and suchlike.

if i find that nylon works great you can always get the parts off shapeways or perhaps find a makerspace in your area with a printer good enough to do nylon. PLA just won't cut it by comparison

Hi everybody!  I'm Ash and i'm currently gathering materials for my first build.  i do have some questions of course.  my first question is how do i create a post on here?

i also would like to know what people think are the best trucks for an eboard?  are the gullwing sidewinder II trucks good or should i stick with regular ones?

i was also wondering what people are using to charge their batteries?  i was gonna do a 12s setup using 2x 6s 8000mah turnigy graphene LiPo batteries from hobbyking, is this a good idea?

i'm planning on using a dual motor setup with 2x turnigy sk3 6354 260kv motors.  i would like to be able to tackle the hills in my area as well as get long range.  would i be able to get about 20mi with my current battery and motor setup?

lastly, for now anyway, i was wondering if anyone knew where i could get as low-profile-as-can-be enclosures for my dual vesc and batteries?

any help would be much obliged please and thank you!

you need to make a few posts before you can make a topic, it's an anti-spam measure. The gold standard for trucks are the caliber II trucks, specifically because the hangars are square which makes it easy to mount the motor. you can modify other trucks to have square hangars but that's a lot of grinding....

oh interesting, you have one of those clasping motor mounts that hugs both sides of the trucks, i'm guessing so you don't need to fool with caliber trucks' square profile to keep the motor mount on?

but yeah i'd work on pretty-ing up that board, really does look like an explosive. Lunchboxes make decent enclosures and you can screw through the board (with some washers distributing load on the lunchbox's thin metal)

Nope! It's a 3D printed part which I was worried about but its lasted me a couple of months with only slight damage.

It does look a lil dodgy.. but solid lunch box idea. I've had issues with the amount the board flexes so I'll have to think of a way to mount it with flex in-mind

Hello,

I'm a noobie requesting some eSk8 tech help on choosing which skateboard electronics to use for a non-skate project. I'm converting a variable speed 12V cordless hand tool to wireless remote activation.

Mostly I request your thoughts to create a short electronic parts shopping list, including brands to avoid, etc. 
Also, I am interested in joining your next group order for one or two of the Enertion Nano-x 2.4GHZ Remote Controllers.

Since this is for a hand tool, I want to stick with a pistol grip ergonomics, but also want the most durable unit available.
How does a TorqueBoards 2.4Ghz Mini Remote Controller (or China knockoff) hold up by comparison in the real world?

I assume that I'll need a VESC or ESC, though I don't know the difference? I simply need to replicate -remote activate- the variable speed throttle that is built into the 12V tool, i.e. just GO & Idle ...no reverse, brake, or trim control is required.

VESC is vague for me. The 12V tool has its own built-in variable speed trigger switch, so isn't adding a VESC redundant?

Once components are acquired, how and where do I connect to the cordless tool without risking a short or overload? Should I wire the VESC/Receiver straight to the motor, as on a skateboard, or splice into the tool switch wiring harness?
  
Minus battery, charger, motor, are additional electronic sb parts required, such as a wiring harnesses, bind pin etc?

The maximum size power pack of the cordless tool is 4.0 AH, in case that makes any difference in component choice. 
Any technical and/or parts sourcing assistance that you or other eSk8 members care to offer is greatly appreciated! 

Epic Eskating to all.. 

TMT

Hi everyone, my interest in e-boards is a little different than most. I'm trying to come up with something that will work as an off road mobility device. Basically a version of the golf board, possibly with steering that will allow me to get around parks, for disc golf. 

I was going to post in the general, but don't see an option to create a new thread, so figured I'll post here. I have no first hand experience with these, and don't want to put a bunch of money in the wrong direction, so my first question is: Going through grass, will "regular trucks" with 10" wheels go okay? I'm debating if I should come up with some sort of high ground clearance solution to minimize drag (something like a modified frame of this [wagon](https://gorillacarts.com/product/gor4ps-gor4ps-c/)). Speed is far from a priority (keep pace with someone walking) but range is a major concern, especially since I'm almost 300 pounds.

Thanks

After reading this forum for years to learn about electric technology,  I now introduce myself as yesterday Okami posted a video about Flexboardz wheels design (and caused my first reply).

Shortly, I've made mountainboards/kiteboards during few years under the Flexboardz brand and I am now  "recycling" this technology in 3 wheels electric scooters, in particular for people with mobility problem (seated version). [Flexscoot](http://flexscoot.com/en/)

Finally, to get more relevant, I hope to launch a second generation of Flexboardz  suitable for easy E-board conversion (see below). 
I will keep learning about electric from the forum members and will open a post about board designs and performances.

My build is 12s lipo, running off a v4.12 VESC

* where can i download the bldc tool?
* how do i configure my vesc?
* what motor should i buy? (i'm between a 149kv 6374 sk3 because i can buy it right now instead  of waiting a month and a 190kv 6374 jlabs sensored motor)
* should i run FOC or BLDC? FOC seems better but apparently you can burn the VESC if you run it at 12s(?)
* how should i configure my vesc so my batteries don't over/undercharge and i don't go over the erpm limit?

Hi, I went for the Alien power system hub pulley adapters two for the kegels and two for Abec style wheels the wheel pulleys connect to the hub adapters and so I can swap the wheels if I want without too much bother. Hope that explains. Also I might make another board.

Hello everyone!  My name is Patrick and I live in Sitka, Alaska, USA.  I've been trying too learn how to build an electric scateboard.  I want an emtb really bad!
  I work as a welder/fabricator/mechanic in the marine industry so I feel like I have a pretty good handle on the mechanical side of things but I'm pretty much at sea when it comes to the electronics.  I've learned a lot from this website so far.  Thanks to all the veteran builders who have made such a good site and community!  I've tried to read all the threads labeled as for beginners.
  Can someone recommend a reference book about the RC hobby please?  In English?  I'm definitely going to get one or two and I want to get a good one.  Thanks!

I had the alien power hub pulley and wheel pulley for the ABEC 11's. It was very badly done and extremely hard to put the screws through the restraining rings. Bad enough that I just threw them away.

If you still have not ordered these yet, you might want to see if you can get a couple off [PXSS](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/aluminum-abec-11-wheel-pulleys-group-buy/14504/92).

Hi I am wanting to start my build very soon and am deciding on parts, I have been doing a fair bit of research. I am going to be building a mono, belt drive system. I am wanting to go for a 10s system by using 2 5000mAh 5S 20C turnigy batteries, a  192kv turnigy motor, a 16/36 system and I weigh around 75kg . Will this be enough to climb a 25 degree slope??

Hey there,
Scotsman living in France for 20 years, I'm just arriving at my tipping point where project must become reality, I've got together a bunch of ideas and would appreciate some advice or recommendations concerning my future build. 

I was a skater when I was younger, own a fixed pitch RC helicopter and I know a thing or two about mechanical engineering, but somehow I can never get my head around electricity! Definitely qualifies as an interesting build for me!

So here's the base: I bought a more or less random board to start out with (Freedom Dolly - Hangnail), of which I don't know much about except that it's bamboo and I like the looks of it :grin:
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/6/4/64d15d7f75eef8bca7d6dfc6507f3dba000fdec8.JPG" width="281" height="500">

Now, I've also got a cart full of stuff on the Enertion website:
- 12mm wide drive pulley kit (I believe it's 275mm belt, with motor and wheel pulleys)
- 83mm Enertion Power Wheels
- Enertion ABEC9 Bearings
- Enertion nano-X 2.4Ghz Controller
- New Vesc-X Motor Controller
- Skate tool (Yeah I know... Sad to say I don't own one yet!)
Now I also have questions about two other things:
- Enertion Narrow Trucks
- 9mm truck riser set

Since I already own a board, with trucks and wheels, I was hoping I could save a few euros if I only bought one truck, to mount my own to-be homemade motor mount. But then, I have no idea how my board would feel to ride around with 2 differents trucks. Probably not very good I should imagine, but since my riding experience is only freshly renewed with, I'm not even sure I'd feel the difference, any thoughts on this? 

The other question is for the risers. I've currently got 70mm wheels, and planning on going for the Enertion wheels, which are 83mm. 
With a wheel radius larger by just over 6mm, I was wondering whether it'd be better to go with the 6mm or the 9mm risers. This is really about detail, as I like my details very much! But is there any real difference in feeling when your cruising at a "higher altitude"? (3mm... right). I'm also a bit afraid of wheelbite...

I'm finishing off by the beginning, as it is always my habbit, and since I would like to profit from the sales on Enertion before they go out of stock! I will probably wait until I get my next pay check to order the motor and batteries. So, on that last thought, this is the hardest part for me: choice of motor and batteries.
- Motor: I've been swinging back and forth between Turnigy's SK3 6374/6355 in anywhere between 149kv to 192kv, and APS's equivalent, in 170kv and 190kv (with one of the problems being they have a 10mm axle, vs the 8mm bore hole in the motor pulley)
I haven't really gone over the power needs for this particular board, given it's really to give it a try, I only weigh about 60kgs but I'd like other people to be able to use it too, so I've basically just looked at what people bought in general, verified that it was roughly the same end use(i.e. max speed, loads) and decided it was good enough for me for a first build. 
The problem is, the choice is fairly limited on APS and hobby king, as they are going out of stock quickly. 

And so obviously, depending on what motor I end up choosing, I'm probably going to buy 2 6S lipos that I'll mount in series, with a capacity of at least 5000mAh if I can find. I'm counting on a fair bit of range (perhaps 20-30kms would be optimal, eventually getting 2 more batteries for a 12S2P setup?) with a top speed of around 35km/h, for a start at least. 

This project is bound to evolve during the process of building it, and afterwards of course. Heck if I enjoy it, I might go onto building a mountainboard also someday :slight_smile: 

So.. That's about it for now! It's nowhere near perfect, but so long as it works and doesn't catch fire, I'll be happy! "_**If it doesn't work, hit it with a hammer!**_" That's what my dad always said.
And please, If I've made any mistakes, or forgotten anything critical, or even not so critical, I'd appreciate a generous return, any and all info is good to know! More questions are sure to come!

Cheers for now!

[quote="Beaverlander, post:734, topic:216"]
275mm belt
[/quote]


Looks good so far but Im 99% sure that enertion uses a 265mm belt (not a huge detail but you said you liked details :slight_smile:.) 

As for the wheels, I would go with the 83mm ones from enertion (or Abec 11s) because the enertion pulley will not fit your 70mm wheels.

Speaking from personal experience, if you are already going for the enertion trucks, I would recommend buying a motor mount from DIY or some other place with Caliber II mounts. I built my own mount out of aluminum and sure it was a learning process and super rewarding but if you just want it to work and you don't have the time (or the patience) to make it work I would go with a pre made mount.

For the risers, I ride pretty high (about 1/2 inch risers and 90mm wheels) and it feels fine once you get used to it. If you go for the DIY mount your can adjust the angles so the motor hitting the deck will not be an issue. My solution to wheel bite was to adjust the trucks so that they physically cannot (under my body weight at least) hit the deck when carving. You can't get as tight turns like this but you can carve worry-free. 

For the motor I would go with a 6374 190kv SK3 due to the fact that 190kv and 12s offer a good speed and torque which is great.

Last remark (sorry for making it such a long post :slight_smile:) be sure to make a build thread! Looking forward to see how it works out for ya. Good Luck!

Thanks for the advice! 
I've already got the material for making the motor mount, or at least a prototype, I like messing around with aluminium as that was my first course: fitter for airplanes, and they really like their aluminium in that industry! But I've also considered just buying a fancy one also, just for practicality reasons. I'll see when I get all the parts if my CAD models work out the way I'd want them too. 

Once I've got everything together I'll be sure to drop a post in the build thread, now that I'm on here. I really need some kind of a hobby and a community to go with it outside of gaming in my free time :smile: 

And I also apologise for the the long posts... I'm a bit of a writer on top of all the rest. I'll try to keep it simple in the futur!

Hi, Miles here.  I'm actually trying to do something slightly different.  My 96-year old Dad came across a video of a motorized walker (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FSWf8vG0kI&t=18s at around 1:34) - and started jonesing for one.  I figure I'll build him one.

Not that different than an electric board - except:
- a wider platform that attaches to a walker frame.
- slow, probably single speed (1-2 mph)

I'm thinking that the ideal approach is a single-piece truck with internal motor, gearing, and battery - attached to a piece of wood might be all it takes (plus attachments, hinges, and such) - probably a dual-motor unit, allowing steering by differentially powering the motor - if I can find the right component.  Otherwise, I'll need to build from piece parts.

It's pretty clear that a drivetrain designed for variable speed, 0-20mph isn't quite the right fit.  I came here hoping that some folks might have some comments on the basic approach, and suggestions as to specific components.

Now, if anybody knows a builder in the Phoenix AZ, or Boston, MA area - that would also be cool.

Thanks!

Thanks Mike!  Definitely a thought.  

Any thoughts on specific units/vendors.  It seems like all of the units I find are on Alibaba - and who knows what the specs or quality are.  I've thought of simply cannibalizing an off-the-shelf hoverboard - but those things are HEAVY.  Keeping weight down is important - shooting for about 15 pounds total - so an old guy can get it into a backseat easily.

Hi

Back in school I used to build decks as a hobby. I worked with a friend and we built 70+ decks. It was a great hobby. I had dreamed of building a deck with electric power but could never fund it. Now I'm out of school and nearly 2 years into a job at a automotive company designing batteries for EVs. Now I have project space, access to tools, and a bit of cash in my pocket. The timing seems right and I am excited to finally start this project. I am in the process of resurrecting my press to start building some decks for this project. I want to build a few boards with off the shelf components and eventually design _all_ of components. My background is Mechanical Engineering, so I am going to be focused on the layout and construction of the deck and trucks. I have an Electrical Engineering friend who has agreed to help with the electrical side. 

I am doing plenty of reading right now and I will soon order components to develop my first electric deck. I want to really get going when I finish building the canoe in my garage!

Thanks in advance for everything!

Hey esk8builders! I've been lurking for a couple of months and finally decided to sign up and join the community. I'm from a small town in northwest Florida called Niceville and I'm getting ready to start my first build.

Still a lot of learning to do so thanks in advance for all of your knowledge and guidance. Oh, yeah I'm built like a dwarf Sasquatch at 6'4 285lbs.

That's a great picture. I have already committed myself to dual but I really want to go quad so I can play around with things like traction and stability control. Here's a picture of my board next to a girl who isn't my girlfriend being held by a guy that isn't me. I think I will have plenty of room for batteries to check the range requirement of my list.

Lol yeah ...that board looks great...prob gonna need some nice size risers for the wheel bite...and a quad... sounds awesome... you have plenty of options on a deck of that size. If you go quad, you could getaway with being just a 6s quad and use car escs to make it cheaper ... but 10s would be sweet

Hi from Warrandyte Australia.  

I love riding my Evolve but the biggest problem I have is my son keeps kicking me off it so he can ride, whilst I end up on his bike.  Solution - build a second board.  I have joined to learn as much as possible from the community, and hopefully one day contribute.  I have been building quad copters for years so I'm hoping some of my knowledge is useful for building an eskate.  I also have a bunch of LiPo's hanging around that I want to put to good use.

I have just purchased a deck to convert.  I really wanted something a bit different to the drop through Evolve so went with dual kicks.  I plan on keeping the build light with replaceable battery packs so this will be a fun play board rather than a carvy cruiser.

Now - onto some research ....

i can't decide between diyelectricskateboard and alienpowersystem

Alienpowersystems is located in the UK - so its easier to order and i don`t have to pay an customs duty.
Price incl shipping is about the same .. 

Any hints or tipps for my Setup ?

Hi there community! I've recently joined the forum and am still learning the works around electric skateboards. I've skated street all my life and now am looking into cruising around town. I'm planning on building a dual motor cruiser with at least one kick tail (i'm too used to street sk8 that i can imagine myself riding without a kick tail). I'll open up a build topic and keep you guys posted! Cheers

Hey,

Just starting out in the Eboard world and am doing some research into mountain E-Boards. Love the concept and would like to build a board that I can use to knock around on and get from a to b. anything up to around 30Kph and strong enough to how 110kg. Will take pointers and places to go to satrt out I guess.

I think the main starting point Id like would be the specs or the components and ratios etc. I'm a technical person but please don't try to dazzle me with all of the hyped up big words and brands names. Simple English will do fine. that way I can widen the hunt for parts.

So I have a budget of $500. Thats the aim. It'll be tight and I think ill probably have to make my board, but thinking positively, I believe I can achieve it.

Cheers

Hey, 

RD here, been busy this whole weekend to read up on builds, set-ups, what minimally necessary to get your board of the ground (a figure of speech, for now). 

So the concoction i came up with:
Battery: 8000mah 22V 15C -- 120 amp max output (maybe buying two in parallel) 
Motor: Turnigy Aerodrive SK3 - 6354-260kv
Wheels: 80mm (orangatang)
Board: 34" longboard(already have that)
Pinion: 15 (easiest to get by)
Spur: 34 or 36
Remote: Ardiuno and wii

After i had dumbed this down for myself, i had to figure out which ESC i needed. If my idea and calculation are correct, you dont want to exceed on voltage but it can exceed amp. Thinking about a VESC (AeroStar Advance 120A HV 6s-12s) but an proper ESC like X-Car Beast Series could do the trick. 

If something is off, please, by all means put me in my place. 

Cheers,
```

Hi, I have been skateboarding for the past 15 years mainly street, but found out about esk8 a few months ago and decided to build my own as I am also a drone freak and usually build my own.

I found this forum which is pretty cool as there is loads of useful information from people's own experience, so I thought I would also share mine as it might help and you guys might also be able to give me a few pointers.

Here is my part list for now:

Board: Madrid Trance fur
http://www.euroskateshop.com/shop/madrid-trance-fur-3743p.html

Motor: N6354 200kv 2300W from Aliexpress
https://www.aliexpress.com/item/Free-Shipping-N6354-2300w-brushless-motor-DC-outrunner-motor-for-electric-skate-board-DIY-N6354-200KV/32715262752.html?spm=2114.13010608.0.0.q5SXMp

Gears and motor mount: https://www.aliexpress.com/item/New-Electric-Skateboard-Kit-Parts-Pulleys-And-Motor-Mount-For-80MM-Wheels-with-Bracket-Screws-Belt/32778230422.html?spm=2114.13010608.0.0.q5SXMp

ESC: Flycolor 150A boat ESC
https://www.aliexpress.com/item/Original-Flycolor-Waterproof-150A-Brushless-ESC-Electronic-Speed-Controller-with-5-5V-5A-BEC-for-RC/32631508140.html?spm=2114.13010608.0.0.q5SXMp

Batteries: still not sure if 6S 10000mAh Lipo or 8S 10000mAh (even tough esc specs is between 2S and 6S) maybe some advice here...

Remote: https://www.aliexpress.com/item/2-4Ghz-Plastic-Remote-Controller-W-receiver-for-Electric-Skateboard-Longboard/32787913157.html?spm=2114.13010608.0.0.q5SXMp


And that's basically all I have for now. I have only recently finished mounting the mechanical part. here are a couple of photos of what I have done so far. Any input, especially on power is greatly appreciated.



cheers

I had seen this used in a previous build and seemed to work pretty well. And also was cheaper that a Vesc...

Issue is it won't work on anything higher than 6S...so I am limited. Will probably go for something else.

Also my pulley ratios isn't too good... 16 teeth on the motor and 46 on the wheel....

@Matthias 

Well.. with a skill set like yours, I believe, you should be able to even contribute greatly to the community as a whole :slight_smile:

I think the most time thinking out things can be spent in getting the right sizes and dimensions dialed in.. not so much about electronics, so you should be 'well suited' for this task ;)

As you have already read probably, then there are a lot of discussions where the right choice of components have been discussed.. If in doubt, just open a discussion and Im sure someone will jump in to help you out ;)

See ya.. and would definately be more interested to hear about your work (battery designing for EV's) in more detail :)

@jeddell

Welcome to the forum!

Im sure you will find plenty of info if you try to search the right keywords ''mountainboard'' / ''trampa'' / ''pneumatic'' etc on the forum..

Non the less.. from experience I can tell that some parts might be harder to source than it is for longboards while at the same time building a mountainboard can be a bit easier because of the more open / wider space for electronics and higher clearance from the ground!

Im sure you have already found a few solutions to how everything should be built but if you got any more questions, please feel free to ask!

Thanks for the reply. Im still learning terminology. Slowly getting a handle on batteries, but the ESCs are proving somewhat of a mystery. 

I cant find any site where there are definitive explanations of components in order to build a system on paper BEFORE going out a spending hard earned cash. Parts arent that cheap, so I really want to get the setup matched properlly before spending any money. Its the reason I added the weight that I expect this board to push.

So I guess that my first ask, somewhere to go and learn about grass roots info on putting the pieces together?

Ill go search through some of the other forums here as well, but in my experience in other forums, they get real technical real fast without actually explaining how they got to where they are.

I have photos of this longboard and I ask, do you think it would make sense open all, see the components and replace maybe engine and battery with a little bit more handsome? 
Thank you

ti servono le schede tecniche dei hub, e della scheda di controllo. ci dovrebbe essere anche una BMS (battery manegment system) che aiuta controllare e caricare le batterie, per sapere se puoi aumentare il numero delle batterie o devi cambiare tutto... è un po difficile ma fattibile.

ideal build would be starting off with a mountain board, with a balance between speed and torque  if that is even possible :D either way i am here to learn.

Mitch here, live in South Dakota.  Yes we have computers, electricity and everything.  Its amazing! 40+ Old, big (6'4" 230#) guy with wife and 4 kids.

Avid wakesurfer, OneWheel rider, decided to grab a companion esk8 for some longer range.  Almost bought an off the shelf metroboard, then saw some trampa videos and changed gears!  

Have an Urban Carver sitting in my office awaiting more components.  Vertigo trucks, 16 ply deck, dual motor Trampa 136kV on trampa urban mounts. GT2B radio with mod.  7 inch gray pneumatics on white Hypas.  Chiboards is building the mother of all batteries for me--12s7p 18000mah, and Frank at trampa is hooking me up with speed control--and the second drive train.  Originally thought single, now just going for broke (possibly literally $$$ LOL) and doing a dual.

Couple weeks away from having it all set up!<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/f/8/f84ec627acfb39654d0d36a9ea4040e2c06d674b.JPG" width="666" height="500">

When my son gets a little older I think we will take a road trip in the Jeep.  I kinda miss the place 😀.

I've never built a tramps and I'm just now building an off-road board but I've built 5 street boards and building 2 more right now.  So if you some I do feel free to tag me.  Good luck.

Well so here is my situation. I am a teacher in a K-6 school and ideally want to do a build with my students. Normally I work on Vintage mopeds with the older grades but this will work well for a younger student and they can legally use it when completed (unlike the mopeds).

Unfortunately I pay out of pocket for all of these projects so the budget is extremely tight. If anyone knows of any educational discounts for any components or donations of parts to schools let me know (we can provide tax refunds). In the end it seems like my cost is going to be around $500.00 regardless of what I do.


It does seem like I may be able to save some cash and improve performance on the $350 budget build by running one of diyesk8's new hub motors. This will clean up the build...seemingly perform better and maybe cost me less?

You could save some money by building things yourself like the longboard deck, the motor mount or print the wheel pulley. The problem I see with hubs is that they work with higher voltages which either complicates the build or results in higher costs.

Hello esk8'rs! 

My name is Michel and I'm from the netherlands. I've had the idea of making an e-sk8 from when my brother and I used to watch Casey Neistat's vlog.
My brother started his build in the fall of last year and ever since my little bro is working on his own DIY esk8 I've been wanting to build my own. Now I finally completed my part list over the last two weeks and ordered it all I wanted to share my build with this much helping forum. 
My idea is to make a nice and solid e-sk8 that is kinda future proof. I want to use it to get to work and university, so I need range. That's why I chose a VESC from enertion and a big battery of 16000mah. The VESC makes it possible to increase my batterypack in the future if I need to. Furtermore an importand note is that I have a 3D printer, so I am planning to print the enertion hub pulley and the case for electronics. Also im going to desing cases for the ligting system and waterproofing the motor and other electronics the best I can.
Ofcourse I will share my ideas and designs on this forum.

Hi all,

I am Sid, a university student. I am rebuilding an old longboard. This is my first electric build. I have ordered most of the parts and I am repainting the deck using a laser cutter for the grip tape and some good ol' spray paint for the bottom. Current setup that I am thinking of going with is:

Deck: Old dustin board
Battery: 6s 5000mah 20c (is 20c too low?)
Motor: single motor setup - tacon Bigfoot 63mm 245kv
Wheels: 83mm flywheels
ESC: Diyelectricskateboard vesc
Controller: GT2B (it seems a little too big, any suggestions for smaller ones?)

I'll make a video and post some pictures after it's running.
```

Hello all! 55yo and retired. Have not been on a board in 41 years. Started out with a longboard 6 months ago. Now up to 3 boards and 1 electric board.

My current electric skateboard is a Blink Board. Many issues with it (parts falling off, etc), so I'm looking to replace it. I actually ordered and then cancelled a Yuneec E-Go2. I love that it can go "up to" 18m on a single charge. I would prefer to build my own but I'm really concerned I'm going to buy all the parts and screw it up.

I have an existing Sector 9 Wedge Complete that I want to convert to electric. It's the perfect size for me, 31.25x7.5. I plan to yank the trucks and wheels off and replace with 9" Calibers and 93mm wheels. I don't care about speed. The fastest I care to go is 7-8mph. I'm more interested in distance. I use my board strictly for transportation. I weight in at 200lbs. I plan to carry a backpack with at lest 2-4 additional batteries that can be swapped out. I live in the desert and it is all flat land riding on asphalt or concrete sidewalk.

Here's my parts list I am thinking of ordering:

Electronics:
Turnigy Aerodrive SK3 - 6374-192kv Brushless Outrunner Motor
2x ZIPPY Flightmax 5000mAh 3S1P 25C Lipo batteries
HobbyKing® ™ X-Car Beast Series ESC 1:8 Scale 120A
HobbyKing® ™ X-Car Beast series LCD Program Card
HobbyKing® ™HK-GT2B 3CH 2.4GHz Transmitter and Receiver w/Rechargable Li-ion Battery
HXT 4mm Gold Connector w/ Protector (10pcs/set)

Other:
 - Single Bolt On Motor Mount w/Drive Wheel Kit
97 mm Green Longboard Wheels
Caliber II Fifty Skateboard Truck - 9”/50deg

I would prefer a set of 9" Gullwing Sidewinder II Trucks, but not sure where I would get a motor mount that would fit and I don't want to weld anything.

Thoughts?

Thank you in advance.

Hi guys!

Long time lurker and first time poster.

I currently have a DIYish e-board I bought from Carvon about a year ago when he first started selling completes. Its a small little cruiser that has a single carvon v2 hub motor, VESC, and a 12s1p battery pack with a123 26650 cells and abec11 97mm flywheels. I really love the setup and haven't had any real issues till recently which is why I finally decided to sign up and hopefully enlist some advice from this awesome forum.

Been skating for nearly 20 years in Los Angeles and have wanted a powered skateboard since day one. I'm trying to build a last mile commuter with a single engine on a reissued vintage skateboard. so far my parts list is:

* Motor: F3A SK3 Seri​es 28 Pole Outr​unner (606​1-240​kv 2700​W) waiting for it to come back in stock.

* VESC: VESC​-X from Enertion

* Battery: SPACE CELL PRO4 from Enertion

* Remote: Torqu​eBoar​ds 2.4g​hz Nano Remo​te Cont​rolle​r

* Pully: Compl​ete Pull​ey Kit Whee​l ​& Moto​r + 12mm Wide Belt from Enertion

* Motor Mount- Singl​e Bolt On Moto​r Moun​t Set from DIY

Still shopping around for a motor and battery. This is just an first draft, should be a fun build.

Ok, so I want to build my first build...Well actually it will be of of an experimental, cheap assed inception.
I just recently saw that 12 year old kid on YouTube make a 3 wheeled skateboard, by piecing together a children's 12" bike wheel, to the chain, attached to a 1000-3000 RPM drill, on a piece of cut plywood...Oh and used bike breakers for throttle, and brake.

So the other day, while doing a trash out on a property, I came across some plywood, a children's 12" wheeled bicycle, and a beaten up bike for the brake/throttle.
 I weigh 140lbs, and wish to achieve 20+ mph on the thick rigid board, and get some decent distance via interchanging out the batteries.
There are a few drills to choose from.  I was hoping to use a 20-24v lithium with an extra battery for under $100.
For the throttle, I plan to take apart the drill trigger, and wire it up to cheap motor circuit that would run to my hand, and would also allow me to use the reverse function for a brake.
Later on, I would attach my own high discharging battery Bank to the drill charger, doubling it.
...Is that even possible?
That said, I don't know if a battery powered skill saw would be a better choice...
Or should I just spend the extra on the typical items?  Eg: motor, esc, battery, and charger.
I still need the trucks, and some basic rubber shocks for the rigid board.
I figure the larger and wider the front trucks, the better for balancing.  Hopefully, not too pricey.
So there you have it:   A unique board without breaking the bank.  Just thought it would be fun..And rewarding.
What does everyone here think of this?  It seems so simple, but will it actually work?

Hey guys, new member and brand new to pretty much everything that goes along with electric longboards. I have all of the parts so far but Id love input to make sur eIm doing it safely.

-Homemade deck
-2.4 Ghz reciever and remote
-10s 42v 20A Li-ion BMS
-single hub motor
-diy electric skateboards vesc
-home made battery and charger, 10s2p
Im fairly confident in my wiring abilities but Ive never made a battery. If someone could draw up how I should wire a 10s2p battery along with how to connect it to the BMS and discharge, Id be eternally grateful.

Hey everyone. Long time lurker while researching. I live in Atlanta, and this is my first complete build, unless you count refurbing a used 2013 Metroboard with a new battery and deck. I also briefly owned a Koowheel and Blink hub that were returned. I ended up going with:
1. Arbor Highground Deck (stiff downhill deck with long wheelbase)
2. DIY Torqueboards dual 75kv hubs
3. DIY Torqueboards dual VESC
4. Enertion Space Cell 3 10s3p battery
5. Ebay Mini 2.4ghz controller
I've only had the chance to ride it twice, but I'm very pleased with the results. I initially set it up with a single hub just to try it out while researching how to set up the dual (5 or so rides), and while it would have been fine for flat terrain, Atlanta certainly isnt flat. The dual setup is great and tackles all hills I've thrown at it so far. The hubs get slightly warm to the touch through the wheels, so I'm sure they're generating some heat. Dexter at DIY was really helpful with research, and I will certainly be going back to him for future builds. This is just a very early initial review, however I can't wait to get back out there and ride tomorrow. Thank you for all the time and information on the forum. I look forward to contributing where I can, but as of now I'm definitely a noob. I'd also like to get together with some riders in Atlanta/Georgia, as I've already seen a few out and about during my rides. Here's a pic. <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/a/8/a82bdf2bd5facabe896a3372e327070bd64bb37e.jpg" width="690" height="484">

need help!!!!

I own a old Stik Carve board and would like to convert it to a electric board.  I don't want to use a pulley system, I would rather use the newer tech and use the new hub motors.  

I've done some research and found no info on converting.  

Is anyone familiar with this. Or have any info?

Thank you for your time,

Get a bigger deck, get another carvon motor (or two new hub motors) and upgrade your battery setup by adding onto that one or buying a 10/12s3p pre-built back. Boom! You have yourself a crazy fun build that can do it all. My dual hub setup with a 12s3p can go way faster than I even want to go most of the time and I have all the same components essentially only twice the motor and battery pack. I have had no issues, what issues are you having? Or is it just not enough anymore?

Looks like a decent setup to start with. I would consider upgrading that battery, but the ratings in general are pretty much bullshit. See many posts on here for more info on that. Just find a build that has held up over time that you like and use the same battery. I ended up going with a big li-ion pack but they can be spendy. I definitely think it was worth it though. On the controller go with the DIY Mini GTB controller. Simple and reliable. If you want to get fancy there are other ones out there with cruise control etc..

Hi! 

I'm building a self balancing "WheelBoard". It has only one wheel in the center, similar to OneWheel and ones alike that.

I just finished building a first version, it works great, now I want to improve it with FOC mode and that is what i'm having troubles with at the moment. 

Here is the picture of my board:

Been lurking for a bit with the end of school.  Planning on building up a board over the summer.  I'd make enough over the summer to buy a boosted, but that wouldn't be nearly as fun.  Worried about the money sink and the potential for it to not work.  Anyways here's my plan:

* Homemade plywood board
* VESC (not sure best place to buy dees) ~100 [VESC from diyelectricskateboard](diy-electric-skateboard-kits-parts/vesc-the-best-electric-skateboard-esc/) 
* Motor? Really not sure what is the way to go here.  Halps plz.  Thinking this is gonna cost ~100?
* 10s4p 18650.  Gonna start with the really idiotic harvesting laptop batteries, checking capacity and discharge rates, and assemble.  Buying good batteries seeems like it would cost ~200 and not in the mood to spend that
* [Caliber Trucks + Bones Reds](https://smile.amazon.com/Caliber-Trucks-Cal-50%C2%B0-Longboard/dp/B06Y5QCGNX?th=1)  (People seem to like these.  plus the rectangular shape should make CNCing the mount easy) ~40-50
* [Orangatang Kegel Wheels](http://orangatangwheels.com/kegel-80mm) (easy for mounting, and people seem to love em)  ~60
* CNC aluminum mount
* 3D print gears (ABS is no go right? Gotta get some better stuff?  There are makerbots that I can use, just not sure what sort of filament to go with) Also how do I choose my teeth ratio?  been having trouble understanding this
* Remote?  Not sure what to do here.  THinking of doing a nunchuck type thing, but not sure how to go about this.  
Also gonna make a spotwelder from a MOT and hope that goes well.  Found some pretty cool tuts.  
So this project is looking to cost 400-500 with parts alone, and a probable extra 100 or more on extraneous parts.  
Advice, comments, caution all welcome :)  Glad to have found the community and seen all the cool stuff here

My suggestions...look at the builds section for ideas.

Buy a deck, it will likely be more stable and more fun than anything you can build.  Decent decks can be had for 50 bucks, search for a massive list.  

If you don't wanna spend the $$$ for li-ion cells check out lipos, a couple of 5s 8000mah packs makes for a pretty good battery pack.  

Of you are going 10s, a 190kv 6355 motor is torquey, fast​ and safe for your VESC...they are also pretty easy to get and not very expensive.  Since you are looking at DIY (@torqueboards) for your VESC, and I buy a lot of VESCs from him,  look at his motors and mounts too.  You can save some money on shipping.

Look at flywheel clones on eBay & Amazon, they are a lot cheaper and the larger sizes available make for a great ride.  

Wheel pulley s made of ABS are great!.  

Look at the mini-logo, I think @JLabs has some for $30.  

Good luck🤙

Thanks I appreciate the suggestions.  
I think I'll probably start out with some lipos.  I still want to try out making a BMS system, so that I can just use a laptop style charger instead of a balancer.  Not sure though if the BMS that I get would work for both lipo and liion.  my guess is that lipos and liions have different voltage ranges, so I'd have to get a new bms when upgrading to a new battery pack
Also checked out an awesome build done mostly with taobao parts, that looked really cool.  Still not sure about how to choose which motor I'd want.  If I go the dual motor route, how does that change my gearing and target motor?

HI! 
Please let me know if i outta read something specific to fix any blaringly obvious ignorance i may have (or not have, depending on how you look at it :wink:)

SO. THE MASTER PLAN (or lack thereof, lol):
I'm thinking of doing a monster of a longboard (as a more eco-friendly daily driver in the summertime than a gas powered car) but also bcos it seems **ridonkulously** fun!... think of a mountain board designed primarily for commute in a town that wasn't well designed for commuting, due to:
-rough sidewalks/pavement
-long routes, unless your board can handle shortcuts over; gravel, grass, dirt, etc.
-_**HORRIBLE** public transit._ Like, so bad that walking for half an hour (or more!) is usually faster.

That said, i tend to be rough on my rideables, so i think i might wanna over-build my board, so  that it _could_ be used as a mountain board, if i end up wanting to go that way.... also, it's very rainy where i live, so it should be able to handle some mud!

I'm a fan of doing things right the first time, & paying a bit more to get a better bang for your buck, or to support ethical business practices, (but i'm also not made of money, unfortunately). I would also prefer to not have to perpetually tune, clean, replace broken parts, and generally spend a ton of time/money on maintenance, replacement parts, etc, more so than is necessary.

I think (from my _very_ limited knowledge) that i would like to go with a dual or quad hub motor design (for hills and traction) ...if that is even possible w/ current tech for an all terrain wheel??? I haven't found such a thing yet, and doubt I have the tools or knowledge necessary to fabricate such a thing... I would also like to look into non-pneumatic alternatives for the A.T. wheels, bcos of durability, and low maintenance (no flat tires ever again!)... such as, perhaps, something like this 
[https://motorbikewriter.com/airless-tyres-coming-to-motorcycles/](https://motorbikewriter.com/airless-tyres-coming-to-motorcycles/)
or this 
[https://youtu.be/LN8VwD0V4RE](https://youtu.be/LN8VwD0V4RE)

A little bit of context:

* I haven't used a skateboard in forever, and wasn't all that good the last time i tried to use one, but i think i'd love to give it another go, particularly if i don't have to kick all the time!

* I have moderate mechanical skills; i can take almost anything apart, and put it back together again, or assemble ikea furniture no problem, but very limited practical (or theoretical) experience beyond that (so, minimal fabricating, if possible).

* I can solder, but don't really know how to make a circuit diagram or how to code, without starting that as a whole 'nother project, prior to this one.

* I'm 165lb / 75kg, 6'2" / 188cm tall

* Also, no idea what kind of protective gear i should have, beyond a helmet...

So... _where_ should i start ?!? :sweat_smile:
(sorry for the monster post, thx for reading to the end :heart_eyes:)

@Papo Are u planning on releasing (making) a build log for your board?

Would be cool to hear a bit more about the Battery setup you are using.

I assume that the cells you are using, are probably scavenged from laptop battery packs.. right?

So.. what capacity do you get out of them and in what config do you have them?

I saw you mentioned quite a bit of range but im not sure about the count of the cells.. so how many individual cells you got for your pack?

Also - after plastic bottle heating for protection, did you cut holes into the plastic to make the needed solder / wire connections?

--

So yeh, if you could shed some more details about your build, that would be nice :slight_smile:

Also looks like your board is not super long.. not even sure what is the total deck lenght you got :)

Hi everyone! I’m a Norwegian engineering student who got a passion for making stuff.
(This post got quite long)

I have been reading this forum since last summer when I built my first esk8. A week ago, I finally got around to join in as a member.

My journey so far has been somewhat unfortunate, solely because of my clumsiness. I bought most of the parts from , which btw helped me out a lot in picking parts, and I bought some batteries and a remote from HK. Before even getting my board to run I shorted the output wires on my VESC and it caused the well-known DRV fault. LP electronics fixed that quick and my board was working great the last two weeks before winter.

While I’ve been waiting for summer I bought a 3D printer (Anet A8) and designed a mod case for the GT2-E. In the process of wiring everything I fried the Tx (?) by connecting it to a LiPo without the 3.7V to 6V step-up module in between.

I then order the Fr-Sky GT2-B. As I found the other mod cases hard to print and/or bulky I designed my own controller again. Everything was going well until I broke the throttle pot and, guess what, those pots are literally non-existent as spare parts.

And to top it off: two weeks ago, I found my LiPos still connected to the VESC after my remote testing before Christmas… They were zeroed out, I’m just lucky they didn’t catch fire. I tried to get them going again by forcing the charger to charge them, which worked on 8 out of 10 cells. So I have removed the two cells and I am now running on 8s 5000mAh.

Finally, I managed to piece together the working parts of both my broken remotes and I am now the happy owner of a "self-made" remote. Although I have had some bad luck, I still love making stuff and riding my board. I am also considering making a new board with dual 140kv motors to have the power to climb Norwegian hills. I would also want pneumatic tires because Norwegian roads are shit. The motor I already have will then be used on my bicycle. I just need work for the summer to afford all this.

PS.: As I now have two working designs for two different controllers I am going to upload them to Thingiverse and make Instructables for both. But it will have to wait to June when my finals are over.

(If read through it all; thank you. Here are some pictures)

Hello all! My name is Rian, I'm from Delaware in the United States. I'm a kitesurfer and former land kiter, mostly kite buggy. I have a Trampa mountain board from my land kiting days that I almost never use, since riding spots are hard to find and it's so much easier to get out on the water. Instead of letting my Trampa collect dust, I'd like to convert it and have it usable for those no wind days. I will admit, I'm generally a lurker and don't often participate in forums, but I hope that when I do,  I will be well received. I have been lurking the last few days, trying to soak up info and I plan to start a build thread, so I can gather input and pose any questions I need addressed. In the meantime, I wanted to introduce myself and try to make presence known. Thanks!

Ok, finally got my  24v, 1800 RPM Green Works drill.
I got it for $32 on eBay, no charger or battery.
I've been needing a 10 amp, variable power supply for various uses.
They are like $60 on eBay.  I could for $20 though, get a 24v, 15 amp power supply.
I was planning to test with one of these, before I go all out and buy a lipo and charger (the drill has its own ECS).
Could the power supply double as a charger?
Hmm, 1800 RPM, will I need to change the gear ratio?

Hi everyone I'm Jake. Hey guys, sorry if this isn't the place for this, I'm a first time poster. I'm new to this site, and am a terrible mechanic. However, I'm desperate to get my Benchwheel working again. Yesterday I got caught riding in the rain. The power button would flash red before shutting off. I could also hear what sounded like popping and wheezing/hissing coming from somewhere underneath the rear trucks if I put my ear right up to it. Now it won't turn on at all, nor is it making that noise.
I'm desperate for a solution, should I start a new thread for this? Can anyone in NYC fix it for me?

Achmed from germany here. just finished my first (and probably not last) electric skateboard build with pretty much only 3D printed parts (except for the board itself ^^).
at least once i figure out how to actualy create a post in builds that is, but i guess i jsut dont have the rights yet!?

The drill is brushless, and will be connected to a chain to a small bicycle wheel.
If I were to buy a 6S lipo and charger, I could always use it on another brushless motor, with an esc, if the drill don't work.   But, is a 24v motor speedy enough?  Could I combine a 6s with a 3s battery, later down the road for a more powerful motor?

Hey, my name is Brastafari. I've owned one that came with a bit of heartache and now I'm ready to build the greatest fucking board on the planet. Something like a Bugatti but even better. I have very minimal technical skills and am here to learn! Located in Denver, Colorado in case anyone wants to meet up for a ride or to teach me build techniques.

Hi, I'm Andy.
After reading along in several forums and watching hours of youtube footage, I decided that it is time to build an esk8 myself. My plan is to either go for good hub motors or a single beefy outrunner (e.g. a Turnigy Aerodrive SK3 - 6374-192kv) setup with 83mm wheels, together with one or two VESCs. Batteries will be home made li-ion.

Wuzzaaaaaapp! :smiley:

I'm obviously new here... I  have a sh!t load of reading to do still... It's all very overwhelming at the moment.... where do I buy the motors from, where do I buy pulleys, how do i know how long the pulley, where do I buy wheels, parts from, etc....

Ideally the goal is to build or see if someone on here can help me build an eboard with 5-6inch wheels, that has a top end around 45-50... Ideally 50, but stick to the 40 range. (Build it more powerful so it's strains less?) AND with a long range (40km?) Where I live... I technically could use it to simply get to work each day. I'll be using less of the skateboard aspect of it, and more as a functional device.

If anyone wants to help, throw items in my direction, i'm all ears, all eyes :smiley:

Hi all,

36 been skating for over 25 years, mostly bomb around on older 80's
decks Vision etc - I have a long board, been sitting in the shed for years and thought I would like to have a go at
turning it into a E board. Would prefer Hub wheels and keep it neat and tidy underneath with casing.

I know a bit about Lipo batts have built a drone before, but not sure about what other battery options are out there?
anything modular more plug & play?

anyways would love some tips on the best hub wheels and some other good parts I need<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/4/9/49f6cbcca677fe3361e02b333b12909dd5ca2551.jpg" width="375" height="500">

after the first build I would like to build one on this 80's styled deck<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/2/0/20f28468150cde42cbe500bbb77984f666918e5b.jpg" width="375" height="500">

Hi,

I'm Lee, and I've researching in the dark really regarding the constructing of an off road mountain board for a while now. I have a bus load of 18650 laptop batteries that i got from the IT department at work which I'm charging, dis-charging (finding the capacity) and hoping to arrange them into a power pack of some kind... 5p - 10s most likely? but that's about as far as i have got. I do have a mountain board to stick everything to! 

I'm a make things from scratch kind of guy and no stranger to building things in my shed, I've gone about as far as i can with FPV drones and after a new challenge!!!   

On a budget same as everyone!!

Any help would be great!

Thanks guys

Bought a Trampa, even after reading through the thread that shall not be named. Ordered Wednesday night last week, arrived Tuesday afternoon. Not bad considering it had to travel from the UK to Australia (Melbourne).

Assembly required a trip to the hardware store, one of the M5 Nyloc nuts used to bolt the trucks on was actually an M4 :unamused: . Still, the board looks amazing in person.

I'm coming from a bike (bicycle) background. Have no problem with electric bikes, but they're just not for me, seems like cheating or whatever. No such hangups with skateboards, looking to mount some motors as soon as the wallet recovers and I get comfortable on this thing.

It's a good thing you all have going on here, certainly one of the more constructive and supportive forums I've come across :+1: .

Hello! I'm Taylor and I'm looking to fix up my broken e-board. I got the 1st gen magneto board around a year ago and it was great for the 6 months it worked. I was riding to class one day and the aluminum truck completely snapped while I was going full speed (no fun). Now it's just been sitting for a long long time but since I found this community today I think I have some ideas of how to fix it. The trucks seemed proprietary at first but it looks like I can remove the motor and reattach it to a different mount and truck setup which would be sick. I miss cruising. But now I'm super super tempted to go the diy route and turn my 46in pintail cruiser into an e-board. Definitely have a lot more reading to do though before I get there

Hello, 
This is Victor, and I would like to build my own eSk8.
Now, I am an electrical engineer with a daily basis job as an embedded sw programmer.
The thing is I don't have experience with motor controll, but I think it would be a good point to start, and a very nice project.
Till now, I know the two major features that my board will have to support:

ESC that will have to be capable to perform brake energy recovery.
Powerpack that has a BMS able to recharge from braking regeneration, discharge as expected and limit the capabilities based on tmperature. 

Now I don't want to integrate any of the already existing open source concepts (even though they might be almost perfect for this application), I just want to build mine, mainly for gaining experience, I am not in a hurry since I'll buy a board to ride in parallel.

Any advice for the aspects to take into account would be helpful.

I also would be grateful if anyone could share a good source for the motors, and the rest of the parts(batteries, bearings, in hub built motor vs belt driven, etc)

Nice to meet you community!:)

Hey, my name is Aaron, and I live in Canada (little north of Toronto).
I'm a 4th year chemical engineering student, and I LOVE building things, taking them apart, and seeing how they work. I destroyed my first family computer when i was about 10 by doing so. I've since then gotten a much better grasp on how things work and have never stopped loving learning since. I've been on this forum just about a year (I built my board last summer),  but never took the time to post here. I love all things esk8, from riding, to building, to troubleshooting, to watching videos for hours on end; I love this hobby and am glad there are so many like-minded people.

Hey there,
My name's Lucas, and I've recently been captivated by the Boosted Boards, until I saw the price tag and contemplated life for a while, realising I'd never be realistically able to afford one. However, I decided to try and replicate one, or at least have a go at making my own electric longboard for commuting to and from uni, and probably around campus.

I have a rough idea and found a nice guide on instructables on how to assemble one, but any advice as to parts and stuff that I should choose would be greatly appreciated.

P.S. What is the difference between an ESC and a VESC?

## \#855 Posted by: Smorto Posted at: 2017-06-06T21:44:37.664Z Reads: 122

A VESC is an ESC (electronic speed controller) designed specifically for Esk8. It has much better braking, has regenerative braking, and it very customizable. However, it can be pricy and if it breaks the repairs can be pricy as well. I recommend the VESC if you are going above 6s, if you aren't, I would recommend the X-car Beast ESC for hobby king. It is pretty cheap and good for 6s.

Hey everyone.  Just bought a used Evolve Bamboo Gen 2.  Love it.  I have a longboard that I love but never ride: Bustin Strike.  I want to convert it to electric.  Looking for a dual hub motor kit for one of them.  Anyone know of complete kit with dual hub motors that I can add to an existing longboard.  Looking for 2 hub wheels, controls, battery, charger, and remote included.  I have found kits like this but they all include the trucks, which I would prefer the trucks I already have.

Check out the video I made with my son showing both boards:

**Hi everyone, I'm Vanarian !** You can call me Chris. 
Been on ES and the french community for years and I've just decided to meet you here too.

When I think "electronics" I kinda think like a mad scientist haha I got many projects to improve DIY building under work and want to bring them to you once ready to test (or fully tested) !

As a reward if you took time to find & read my short presentation in the whole topic, here is what I currently work on : 

- **improving VESC thermal management by leaps through hardware**. No more fried VESCs. No more ABS_OVERCURRENT Fault, this will work with any version (VESC 4.xx, VESC6, VESC-X and of course Rogier Wolff "rew" version)
- **improving outrunners cooling when fully insulated**. This allows waterproof/dustproof yet retain at least same perfs than standard. For hubs this is a must.
- **solderless omni layout li-ion battery pack assembly**, no matter your S or P you can assemble easily however you want super duper easy. Vibrations and high discharge proof, shockproof when encased. Made for abuse. I'm already testing the v1 for myself.

My others current projects are more personal : finish building my 3.2kw electric inline skates and converting my wife's longboard into a slim 3.2kw electric but reliable fun. More stuff coming in the future but I should finish all this first.

Look forward to know you guys !

MWM-4-ESK8

  Friday last week was the last day of school for my eight-year-old daughter. I had been promising her all year that she could ride her scooter to school on the last day. Knowing I would not be able to keep up, I decided to follow on her skateboard.  I made it nearly 150 feet (just in front of the neighbors house) before I ate it. Sprained my wrist, fractured my hand, broke two fingers.  Upon reflection in the aftermath of this  dubious folly it occurred to me that my problem was not the fact that I hadn't been on a skateboard since the 80s, or my negligible athletic prowess. The real problem was that kicking the skateboard places one in the precarious position of being off-balance and standing on one leg whilst mounting a rolling piece  of wood traveling across an unpredictable and uneven surface!  The obvious solution was to devise a method whereby my feet could remain planted on the board during the propulsion phase. Hence, I am now building my first electric skateboard.  I suppose most people in my position would take this as an indication that their skateboarding days are behind them, Eff that. I'm ramping it up a few notches.
  I live in Florida where I can ride year-round with nary a hill in sight.  I started a new thread in the "new builds" category for my first project. I will try to keep the cost down because eventually my wife will find out about this and I will need money for the divorce.
 I order my first batch of parts this Friday. I chose my handle because the first week or so that I was lurking most of the conversations where people identified themselves were populated by folks in their mid teens - mid 20s. Since then I was relieved  to learn that there are a few other 80s children on here as well.  I cannot wait, this is going to be rad (and maybe even gnarly or bitchin).

Hi, I'm a new member and I got into this forum after looking for problems of the evolve carbon gt. Seeing a lot of people have trouble with this and I myself have had troubles with inboard m1 I'm looking into building one myself. At least then I can service it myself and got nobody else to blame. 

Can I build something with the performance of the evolve carbon gt myself? I'm a heavy rider at 90kg and the inboard m1 just doesn't cut it uphill :/ I'm happy with everything else about the board tho..

Hey guys, my name's Evan and I'm just putting together my first eboard. Currently I have the deck, wheels, and trucks and am purchasing the other parts. I'm planning on buying two Turnigy sk3 aerodrive 5065 280kV motors, 3 Turnigy 580mAh 4S 35C 14.8V LiPo batteries, and a standard transmitter and receiver, a motor mount for both motors, and some type of ESC. I have 3 questions:
1. Will the batteries work with those two motors?
2. How should I mount my motors? Should I mount them DD, DR, or DF?
3. What type of ESC should I buy?
Any help would be greatly appreciated, thanks!

Hi All

First of all let me say - an awesome forum, very informative and alive!
I want to introduce myself, I'm Dani, 36, currently live in US.
I'm engineer by profession and an avid DIYer in heart :slight_smile:, it is so great to see a lot of creative people here, really refreshing.
Couple of months ago I started a self motivated project, you can check it here: [dosimplecarbon.com](http://dosimplecarbon.com), go to [The Project tab](http://dosimplecarbon.com/the-project/).
I think this forum might be interested in this topic, because It's really innovative and different.
I update the project on a weekly basis, and it is progressing in a good pace, you can ask anything you like and I will answer to the best of my abilities :slight_smile:

And first questions from my side. I've searched this forum for pneumatic wheels, whenever they are used it is typically 5-6" wheels which are mounted on standard trucks with spacers. Is this the common practice?
Are you satisfied with this method? Is this a real problem? I mean do you want to be able to mount the bigger wheels on standard trucks? With say any spacing?

I'm asking because I might have a solution for this issue, and would really want to explore this.

I'm really glad to be a part of this community.

Enjoy,
Dani

 Hello guys and gals  :D 

  Me myself is PHD in cyber-psychology  so I am a potato when it comes to engineering :D  But I want an electric board , but I am still a potato :D  So Geared with Wikipedia articles and YouTube video-guides I build first board  and burned the controller completely  (I am happy battery did not blew on my face) :D. I want to build one not cos it is cheap but for DIY spirit itself, just so u know.
  Right now I am hoping to get my hands on one of these:
[DIY Kit from Alibaba](https://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/2017-dual-motor-skateboard-booster-motorized_60578781006.html?spm=a2700.details.maylikever.11.VuObZz)
Seller said it is dual motor 90" wheels 250W each motor. So I am just wondering  if those motors would be sufficient enough to commute in the city at decent speed? I dont have really any experience and decided to turn to people that have :D:D:D

Hi eSk8 builders community,
I ride my Long-board to work each day down the esplanade. I've just started buying some parts to complete a build. I'm pretty rural and the road quality around me isn't so good and I've got groomed trails in national parks north and south of me only a km or 2 away. I also do a bit of photography and are hoping to be able to ride out to shoots with my pack as well as have some fun. I sold my motorbike when I moved to the island, the wildlife is just crazy, so I'm hoping I can get some thrills on a eMTB without killing myself :P
I can't wait to get building, see you all on the boards.

hey everyone!

I've been lurking on this forum for months trying to get a good understanding of this esk8 thing, and now I am finally trying to build one.
I am originally from Brazil ant thanks to my work as a video-game artist I was able to live in Europe and experience a little of their culture. Now I work for Valve and live in the US in a city called Bellevue (close to Seattle).
I always enjoyed manual work and during my graduation in architecture I used to pass a lot of time on the university workshop, it is terrific after those years to come back to something more manual and not related to computers.
This forum is being a great source of knowledge, and I am thankful for that :)

Hey, my name is Mark and i'd like to milk you guys for free answers.

Listen up gang, i got myself a plan here to build an electric skateboard, see?
I'm very very new to this, but here is the parts list i have so far:

**Board:** 
1x Loaded Vanguard Longboard Deck 
2x Caliber 2 fifty 10 " truck
1x set of 4 Orangatang Kegel 80Mm wheels
1x set of 8 Bones China Reds Bearings

**Motor & Electric stuff:** 
2x https://goo.gl/fEijgR
2x Turnigy Aerodrive SK3 6374 192kv | 2750W | 10~12S Lipoly Brushless Outrunner Motor
2x https://goo.gl/cBTXuM 
2x Turnigy 50A | 3-12S LiPo | 12.6-60V VESC with BEC
2x Turnigy Heavy Duty 5000mAh 6S 60C Lipo Pack
1x HobbyKing HK-GT2B 3CH 2.4GHz Transmitter and Receiver w/Rechargable Li-ion Battery

**Would this even work?** 
**Do i even need 2 VESC's?** 
**If i built this with these components, how would i brake?** 
**And how would i recharge the batteries?**

Also, the cost of all this ends up at over 1000€. In theory the board should be strong right? But **is there any way of mantaining or even improving specs and reliability while reducing cost?**

Answers to all these questions would be much apreciated

I also feel like i need answers to questions that i'm missing because i don't understand much of any of this.

Thanks for all the help in advance

The VESC question is easy. The ratio of motors to required speed controllers is 1:1. So yes, two motors, two controllers.

You'll need a battery charger. The IMAX B6AC V2 is popular (I have one as well). 

Breaking will be controlled by the VESC and can be adjusted.

Since you are getting the wheel mount and pulley from DIY I'd recommend getting the motor mount from them as well, you can get it in a kit. I've got one and it was shipped fast and has been rock solid. 
2x -

There is a dual motor mechanical kit, but that comes with trucks and wheels,which you already have plans for.

Also be sure to check out your specs here to see if it leads to the performance you are expecting:

http://calc.esk8.it/#{"batt-type-lipo":1,"batt-cells":6,"motor-kv":192,"system-efficiency":80,"motor-pulley-teeth":16,"wheel-pulley-teeth":36,"wheel-size":80}|

I'll leave the rest up to the experts as I've only just completed my first build.

Lastly, I believe  you will be asked to move this to the new builds thread so responses can be posted there instead of the new member forum.

Thank you for all the information, it's super helpful.
That top speed calculator that results in about 23 km/h weighted, and that's a bit low, what do you reccomend i do besides maybe getting bigger wheels? Should i get more kv's motor and lose torque or get like 4x 6s to give 12s to each motor? What would you say is more worth it?

## \#891 Posted by: oldguy Posted at: 2017-07-04T17:53:27.524Z Reads: 113

```
You have to  be careful with 12s  because you can exceed the tolerance of the VESC  (ERPM limit?) at some point. Other members know more than me, I do not have a VESC.  aside from wheel size  The next best thing to do is gearing, but you are already at 16/36 which is pretty standard. 8s might get you there and is still well below tolerances.
```

## \#892 Posted by: oldguy Posted at: 2017-07-04T17:58:20.322Z Reads: 133

```
 My very basic understanding is if you are going to do more batteries in series, you typically need a motor with lower Kv,  and the inverse is also true.  Most builders on the forum go with 90 mm or 107 mm wheels. I have a moderately high kv motor (sk3/260kv)  and with 90 mm wheels and 16/36 gearing that runs on 6s  I can get to just about 43kmph unweighted (28mph)  In practical terms that puts me at about 22 or 23 mph standing on the board. I haven't quite pushed it wide open yet. It starts to get scary about 18 mph. Even at 260kv/6s  I feel like I have plenty of torque. I also live in a pretty flat area however.
If you post your stats in the New Builds thread you may get some more responses.

Hi everyone!
I am still looking for the components for my esk8. I have a 300-400 euro budget and I'd like my skateboard to go 30-35 km/h max (I have only had few experiences with skateboards so far and I don't want to kill myself). 
I am browsing a few websites and I have found this kit on hobbyking: https://hobbyking.com/en_us/catalog/product/view/id/63725/s/skateboard-conversion-kit

I couldn't find anyone's opinion on the kit, so I ask you: would you try it? Why and why not? Which components seem alright and which look like sh*t? The VESC is very cheap so it could help me save a few bucks

Hi everyone!

I'm not super technical so I wanted to buy a complete longboard and ended up getting an Inboard M1.
I've only snowboarded before, so I'm still getting used to this wheeled boarding and feeling the ground and such.
I heard the board was kind of badly regarded in this forum though XD
Anyway, I'm in SF and down to ride whenever I have time.

Hey all! I'm Dan from CT!
Building my first board using a blank Elher's 40in Bottlenose. It has a little flex, so I'm planning a split enclosure. Unless anyone knows where I can snag one at a reasonable price. I have my caliber II 50° trucks, 83mm clones, VESC from DIY. Trying to build this using a Tacon Bigfoot 160 (245kv). I know I'll have to limit the erpm, but if anyone knows another reason I shouldn't use that motor, please let me know. When searching, I've seen some other folks using them.  I'm also waiting on a motor mount group buy. Going to use Lipo to start. Was thinking 8s. Still have to figure out what remote to use & odds and ends.

But I returned the Liftboard after 3 days(motor mount failure), and now my current plan is getting the Louboard 3.0 for $1080.  
I really liked the dual liftboard, and the company support has good reputation, but the board failing that soon has me wondering if electric skateboarding can be reliable or not.

I have a lot of experience using those motors for robotics, and while they're great power per weight, they don't have the thermal capacity to keep something like a longboard moving for long periods of time without burning up. So they could work, but you would go through a lot of them. They can also easily use more amperage than most motor controllers can handle so you could burn a controller too. 
And like @willpark16 said, this is an inrunner and brushed. Nearly everyone uses a brushless outrunner motor because of efficiency and the torque.

This is my project, it's a 39" deck, 10c4p li-ion battery, tb 6374 190kv motor, and a vecs speed controller. The plan is to make the shortest deck I can with the most ground clearance. 

The battery enclosure is from Psycotiller. It has a small defected because of the heat wave we had on the west coast. He's a good dude and sent it anyways and promised a discount on my next order. It wasn't a bad defect, and I was  happy to have it so I could get to planning my build. It's a good box, and would recommend his work. I had to cut it down a little, but because of the design it was easy to take a inch of it and have it still seal up nicely. 

I have some rat nuts I plan to use to attach the enclosure. I am thinking of cutting a inch or two off the nose and reshaping the nose to make it less of a freeriding shape, and more downhill in shape. Also looking at tail and 👃  guards.

The risers will be adjusted once I know how much room I have,  I'm using hard rubber wedges on the the trucks, and will likely dewedge the back, and wedge the front. I've added generic extra long cone bushings to the road side of each truck. I didn't like the stock bushings that came with the tb clone trucks. The new bushings are much more responsive but they could be better.

I've been pushing wood for over 20 years 😜

Hi! I'm a new member. Was looking into getting a Boosted Board, but thought they were kinda expensive. Was really on the fence about purchasing one. Then as I was looking on videos, I saw someone do a DIY Electric Skateboard for around 500$. I don't expect mine to necessarily be that cheap. Got me more interested and they had a link to this website. Building a customize board sounds a lot more fun and personal to me. So I think i might want to give it a shot. Here's a little about myself. 

From Michigan,USA. I'm about 5'7 and 190 lbs. I am looking to build a board mainly for transportation from home to work. I live in small town and just under 5 miles is my commute. my commute is all thru the city and would be on Bike bath, non-busy roads and with a little sidewalk.

I have looked around the website a bit the past few days, and understand the basics of building a board. I guess I'm more curious about the specifics of what I should get to build it. Or just have someone point me in the right direction to get started.

GOALS
Be able to travel 15-20 Miles on a charge.
At least 20mph Top Speed. Don't need to go faster then 25 mph I would think.
Have a stable/ safe ride. I'm more concern about getting to point A and B rather how fast it gets me there.

Hello, I am a new member and new to the esk8 scene.  I am an avid golfer and I have seen a couple of eboards out there like Golf Boards and Golf Skate Caddy.  After speaking with my home course they said they are open to eboards so I'm here to get ideas on how to build one.  

I'm 6'2" 220 so I need something sturdy and powerful to move me around the course.  What I need is some that will travel 10-15 miles on a charge.  I'm too concerned with speed thinking 10 mph will do.   My course is somewhat hilly so I will need it to have a enough torque to make it up the hills.  Would like to keep it under $1000 if possible. 

Like I said I'm new to this so any suggestions you might have would be greatly appreciated.

After that I wish I have some orders to build esk8 from my friends for them, I really enjoy building esk8es :blush: 
electronics and motors I buy from APS, it may change if I'll find better suplier, common components (batteries, chargers, connectors etc.) I buy in Poland.

Hello all - I have been wanting to build an eskate for a few months now, but have just gotten my board back from my parents home a few states over.

I primarily want to use this to commute to and from work and will be watching other build threads to get the hang of how it works.

I am pretty terrified of the electric side of things.  Knowing how big a battery or what cables I need isn't something that I know well (or at all), but I understand what components in general I will need!

Look forward to finding out more.

Hello!

I have been lurking for a few weeks now, after my friend built a board, and I tested it out.  I am a Mechanical Engineer, with some experience in electrical systems (industrial motion controls), so naturally this is an appealing project for me.

The build I'm planning to do:

218mm wide trucks from DIY Electric Skateboard
90mm wheels
10s (42v) battery setup (I purchased some battery packs consisting of LG 18650 cells and integrated BMS)
16:32 pulley ratio
Focbox

I have a question about the selection of a motor.  I am trying to decide between a 6355 190kV motor and a 6355 260kV motor.  It is my understanding that with my eRPMs limited to 60k, a 190kV motor would be ideal.  But I have only heard of the 60k eRPM limit pertaining to the VESC.  What is the eRPM limit on the Focbox?  If 77k is an acceptable eRPM limit for the Focbox, then I should be ok with the 260kV motor.  Correct?

The calculations I'm doing are based on those laid out by @chakra here:
https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/choosing-the-right-motor-kv-for-the-vesc/3125

Maybe @onloop can answer the question on max eRPM on the Focbox?

Thanks!

i have a 10s2p 26650 42v custom pack and i want to power rgb leds off of it, can i just plug the leds into the vesc so they change brightness with my speed? do i use a voltage stepdown? my leds run off of 4.2 volts. i do not want to use resistors or a separate power source.

also if possible i want to be able to control the color of the rgb leds with the wireless controller, is that possible with arduino?

sorry for bad english :3

Hi!

my name is Frank,  I live in north Germany, and I have been watching this forum for a while already.

Toda I would like to make a contribution in the hope that it will be helpful to people wanting to build their own 18650 type battery packs.

I am 64 yrs old I surf, sk8, snow board, wake board,kite board, moto x, raced BMX. I have always love the feeling adrenaline gives you . Life goes fast and I can still remember all those insane times. Free spirits are what drives this industry as well as all other action sports. The ability to appreciate what others are doing to improve e sk8 is inspiring. If I get 10 to 15 good sk8 sessions a year I am grateful. Because it's not just the ride it's the friends and family  that make the journey worth the efforts. Bringing joy to others is just as rewarding. hope everyone out here has a great safe year and let's tinker , improve and share so that our family gets bigger and closer together. Competition is what brings out our best so sk8 on.

Hi Filip a lot of people use hobby King good source for us. I buy bats speed controls motors and controller from them, other parts are home made or  other suppliers. For us at Santa Clarita sk8 club gears are hardest to dig up tried different brands and types but think we finally are getting it nailed down. Good luck !!!

Hi, I´m a 22 yo from germany and am going to study mechanical engineering this fall. 

I want to build an electric penny board for commuting and also for when I´m travelling. I love to go on short trips in europe and since I´m a student I do a lot of hitchhiking and generally try to avoid paying for transportation (or anything really lol). This is why I often have to walk kilometres with my sometimes heavy ass backpack.

Since my build is purely inspired by practicality, top speed is kind of a non-issue for me. 20kph would be enough for me. Instead I will go for maximum range/price ratio.

As for the components, the turnigy set that was released on hk a couple weeks ago looks interesting to me, so if its a sensible setups for my needs regarding range/vmax I think I will go for it (have to read the drivetrain guide properly yet)

For the deck I will use the pink pennyboard of my little sister and strengthen it with some sturdy material so it doesnt flex.

Hey all, I'm a recent transplant to Atlanta, GA and decided on an Eboard to help make the commute more enjoyable.   While researching various commercial boards, I stumbled into this forum and have been reading about DIY builds.  It's about time I signed up as my components for the build are showing up. The first is from @Kaly (thanks for the great work on the battery pack and enclosure!) Today my VESC-X showed up from Enersion, and now I'm waiting for my complete deck, motors, etc... from @trampa they should be here soon as the tracking # shows them having arrived in NY yesterday.. countdown to build time!  

I grew up skateboard and snowboarding, so we'll see how much muscle memory is left! <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/8/4/84577ed2ace5113373595016d059cfbc89803c69.JPG" width="666" height="500">

I found this [thread](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/start-here-faq-for-diy-electric-skateboard-builders/215) by @onloop which was super helpful, but I still have some miscellaneous questions that I'd like to ask.

I posted in general discussions and I hope some of you guys can help me with this.

Hi All,

almost two months ago I subscribed to this forum. It's really great and you learn a lot about building your own esk8. I live in the Netherlands and as far as I know they are illegal here. But who cares right? I ordered all the parts to build one myself and only need to make a motor mount and start assembly. It's my first build so i hope i don't f**k up ;-)

UPGRADING TO 6" OR 7" OFF ROAD TIRES?
AND WHERE TO GET THEM AT A REASONABLE PRICE?
Hi a few months ago i got the ELX form ELX.com an im quit happy with it... 
i have upgraded to a VESC so now the ride is a lot better... only upgrade i'm thinking about is 6" or 7" offroad tires... but i'm having a hard time figuring out if i can make them fit, and get the gearing right.. 
Will i need wider trucks (and then new motor mount etc) i'm guessing that 6" probably will work?
im not planing to go full on downhill... just over a bit rougher road, some grass and maybe a forest track...
any suggestions? recommendations?

Hi, joined a little while ago, I'm in Ireland near where Luke Skywalker was found on that strange little Island.

While I planned and still plan to make a Trampa-based ATB, pulleys, belts and mounts compliments of @Idea, dual APS 6374 170kv sensored motors with a 12s7p 30q pack in a customised Veruzend solderless pack & a pair of VESC-X's from @yummyblobs . I need some Trampa superstars or to figure out a 3d print design for the scrub wheels that came with the board I picked up as the hole spacing is different (My 3d printer is in storage right now).

I also need to drill the truck spring adjuster holes as this is an older board. Would love to get a template @trampa ? 

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/5/9/59a9e510c81676c0e1ea22163159f81089f3b38f.jpg" width="690" height="368">

I think I pretty much have what I need to complete apart from space as I'm moving house again in late August and in a holiday house for summer with no makerspace.

 I have added more parts to the repository, a MBS ATB with 100m MBS UT wheels, pulleys compliments of @johnny_261, a pair of VESCs from Vanda, running a pair of APS 6355 190kv & motor mounts from @Shogu12 to run a 12s4p pack of Samsung 25R. Will switch to blackout caliber II fiftys.

Both the above will be BMS'd by the GB ran by @fedestanco when ready (designed by @JTAG)  

In negs with @TranxFu to repurpose a loaded deck which I plan to mount some calibers(picked a few sets in sickboards sale) on and 90mm UT wheels from @atenner, I will try a hobbyking motor mount to see if I can break it as in store for this is a big-ass 6384 motor from APS with kv200, I will run it in single motor config with a FOCBOX from @monkey32 & will run a 10s4p pack of HE4 (they were cheap and very close in spec to HE2).

Lastly I should also have some kegels to play about with for what I'm not sure, I have some art boards I could try 

A custom Escudero 'Venom' board 

Cheers AJ

New guy here, new to the forums and to building electric vehicles... I am familiar with electronics and gas engines. I figured I would give electric a try. I have a 1500$ budget and was thinking of doing a dual rear motor Setup running 2 80cc turnigy rotomax motors on a mountain board (I know they are big but figured with my weight and positioning the pack(s) towards the front it should off set the weight. I will most definitely be needing some guidance and help, recommendations are always appreciated and welcomed I will make a build log when i figure out how. Hopefully with y'alls help I can make a board that can tackle the hilly terrain as well as give me the speed I want.

I have never made a battery pack so i may commission someone here to do that or look up how to do it and tackle tht.

for now tho, here's my drawing and I'm about to start working on the mounts.

Hello, bsb stands for Boosted Surf Board, a project i started last winter. I built an outrunner motor which works under water and is directly connected to the prop. It can take 60-80Amps and 45V. I use 32Ah 12S and used a YEP120A HV, which unfortenately burned up because the cooling was broken. I purchased a VESC-X or focbox like it is called now and hope i can benefit from its possibilities and advantages. I want to build up a new water cooling and i would like to test it for its effectiveness. I saw this nice video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6lPdI9OVQg
Ben is using some special mode or parameter set to sink a lot of current in a motor which is under water and turning very slowly. I would like to do it as well. How is it done? Is there a thread dealing with such questions?
Thank you

You are probably best replying/ asking questions to BV on his [vesc](http://www.vesc-project.com/ ) site or one of his other pages. If you see Frank from Trampa around he can likely put you in the right direction he distributes the VESC6.
A powered board sounds cool, many have been watching vlogs of this dude who made a hydrofoil... have a look for the post & GL bro sounds like fun!

Maybe do some research @Holyman92 in to the shaft size and how it mounts in the motor, [how to remove your motor shaft](http://www.scorpionsystem.com/building_technic/change_shaft/) & you might be able to either [make a suitable shaft](https://www.rcgroups.com/forums/showthread.php?1240725-Making-and-Replacing-a-Brushless-Motor-Shaft) or buy one for a helicopter so you can reverse mount the shaft so it sticks out the other end of the motor? :sunglasses:

Maybe it could be easier than making a funky mount?

Hey everyone, about to build my second-ish board once parts come in. This is my first board, but I helped a friend build one last year, which was a big learning experience. I've learned that it is better to get the best parts and invest the first time instead of replacing mediocre parts repeatedly. My board will be like a boosted clone but slightly different. I have the deck from a boosted board, a 6355 190KV from DIY, 10S3P HG2 battery pack, FOCBOX, motor mount from DIY, Magsafe charging, and headlights (eventually). I have designed some custom enclosures to house everything which will be almost exactly the same size as Boosted's enclosures. This forum has been full of great info and people, and I can't wait to get started building!

I'm new here and thinking about rebuilding my Loaded Ceviche into an electric board. (https://www.amazon.com/Loaded-Freeride-Longboard-Skateboard-Complete/dp/B007ZBPX5Y). 

I will mainly use the board to go to university about a 15 minute ride from home. The roads are pretty smooth and no hills. I've pretty much decided on hub-motors because of less noise and easier assembly as it's my first build. Keeping the front truck on my board and mounting the 'motorized' truck in the back.

I've been looking at a few different parts and want to know what you think. I know it's a little higher risk buying chinese parts, but I want to keep down the price a little and not spend $1000 on the build. Located in Sweden and weigh 80kg/176lbs.

Motors:
Dual maytech 70mm with trucks. (https://www.aliexpress.com/item/Maytech-5pcs-10-OFF-challenge-skateboard-50A-VESC-7052-diy-longboard-hub-motor-with-truck/32775419857.html?spm=2114.10010108.1000023.14.4b24ae2b0d80mZ)
Downside with this is the quite low top-speed (around 25kph/15mph). I would like a top speed over 30kph/19mph. Thinking about a bit larger wheels (maybe 80mm) for a little higher top speed. I've heard maytech are alright for the price.
- Any other alternatives or opinion about the maytech?

Vesc:
Is it a bad idea to buy a package from aliexpress and maytech with the included vesc? Is it much better to buy the vesc seperately? (more expensive also...) 

Batteries:
What batteries would you recommend for my setup? Desired range would be 10 miles+

Sorry for all the beginner questions but would really appreciate the input!

Hi! My advice to you: Spend a little more.
Yes, you can buy all chinese parts. Yes, for some people it works well. The problem is, when it doesn't and that happens while driving at 30/40/50 kmh, you learn to fly unvoluntarily. 
There are some tried and tested sellers of vesc's on these forums. Enter "VESC EU" into the search bar and see what comes up. 
Motors I can't say - I only ride belt drives.
Batteries: Read up on the difference between LIPOs and LION cells. Read up on the different brands and models of the 18650 LION cells. Before you buy and you're unsure, make a forum post.

This is a great hobby you're getting into, just one where you benifit if you read loads. You've found the right place for that, now it's on you :)

Hi all, currently I am building my first electric board. After some looking around and receiving enough info from @JTAG and @MrEpiquad (thanks!) I ordered all the gear. 

I am using a Bob Brunotti board and found a cheap dual motor setup on Ebay, I haven't seen any reviews on it so I will keep you posted about the performance, for now: it looks really good, feels sturdy and is cheap. My only concern is that the belt is really tight, so probably some tweaking is needed ;). Here is the ebay link and some pictures. [1500W dual motor kit](http://www.ebay.com/itm/DIY-dual-1500W-electric-longboard-drive-kit-83MM-wheel-7-trucks-CNC-mounts-/322549102279?hash=item4b196cb6c7:g:I0UAAOSwbtVZOttQ)

I also started with a glass/carbon fiber enclosure big enough to fit two Zippy 8000mah LiPo's and the electronics. In the future we will make a mould to make a nice and sleek carbon fiber enclosure. 

Furthermore, I will be using VESCs (4.2) and the BMS developed bij JTAG :smiley:.

Hi! everyone I’m new but I already star to reading immediately, like 2 weeks ago… I forget to introduce myself
well I’m from Chile (South America) and I’m in the phase of reading (a lot) to understand how to start a build because I do not know anything just soldering (I think!). so, lest start with what I have in mind! 
Longboard Setup
Deck: Loaded Icarus Flex 1
Trucks: Gullwing Pilloni Reverse Blue/Black 10.0/47A Blue/Black 
Wheels: 83mm Flywheels clone + Bearings Bones Red

For the Electronic setup:
Motor: Turnigy SK3 6374 192kv
Mount: Turnigy skateboard conversion kit
Pulley: 36T ABEC Pulley combo kit (36T/13T)
ESC: Torque ESC VESC BLDC electronic speed controller 
Batteries: 10S1P 5Ah (Turnigy 5Ah 2S 30C Lipo w/XT90)
Remote: 2.4GHz Radio Remote controller + Receiver (From ebay, really cheap)

Others: 
Metr 
XT-90 (to connect in series the batteries)
5.5mm Bullet connectors (need to change the connector from the motor to connect to the VESC)
ABS Sheet 3mm (For make the case for the VESC and the Batteries)
Plus, other things like Nuts and locktite etc to put the things in the board.

What I have in mind after this build is to make another 10S1P 5Ah batterie to make it swappable.

Right now I need to find a BMS and read about VESC

That´s it!
Tell me what do you guys think! (I think is rock solid)

Hallå eller?!

I'm Lowe, from Sweden. Been longboarding since 2010 and meddling with electronics since I was a kid. Began combining both when I discovered Casey Neistat.

So far I've done 2 builds. Once I'm done with my current Boosted clone I might make a smaller(penny sized) board.

I love photography, so I try and do my best to document my builds as much as possible. Been dipping my toes in video filming/editing with my Sony a6500. Might post more of that in the future. 

While I do love my longboard, it seems I'm more into building the stuff than actually riding it.

Cheers

Hey everyone. Im a new member to this forum. a little bit about me: I'm currently studying mechanical engineering and I've been tinkering and building electric skateboards since high school.

most of the DIY e-boards i've seen are bluetooth controlled, but what do you guys think about weight sensing boards, such as the Z-Board? Have any of you guys considered doing a DIY weight sensing board?

Hey Group!

Probably like quite a few others here - into many different things - like to build/make. CNC'd a mill a few years ago - have plenty of drones, etc. Started early life as a surfer - it never died. less surf now, more snowboarding...want to see if I can do more. :wink:

Hey all, I've been looking into esk8s for about half a year now and decided it was just time to take some action, especially before I go to college with financial responsibilities! I have a Loaded Vanguard Flex 3 that's all beaten up so I'm not looking to make an ascetically perfect build, just one that's neat with dual motors. I plan to be making my own controller and know I need dual vescs but I'm lost as to the rest of the electronics and the specific ones to buy. I'm 6 foot and 210 pounds so I'm a little worried that dual motors won't handle me. Anyways, sorry for the long winded post, but I'm excited to finally join the community!

I would like to use LiPo for the convenience and price and am thinking about going along the route of the @jackw Beauxsted Board with some personal creative spins. He's using two 6355 190kv 16-36, but I'm not sure if it is still one of the the best options or if something else has been developed that would be better for me. I would like either 20 or 25 mph since it is my first build and most likely won't be ready to go any faster and I would also like the range to be 25 miles or higher, but honestly, I'll take what I can get haha. Thanks so much for your help and input!

Hi everybody,

Let me introduce myself. My name is Mathieu and I live in Montréal, Canada.
I am more a snowboarder than a skateboarder but I am pretty sure I will enjoy the ride.
So, here I am jumping in the DIY world because it seems really fun and I'm always willing to learn.

## What I'm looking for my first build :

- Range : +/-30 km  or +/-20 miles
- Speed : +/- 40 kmh or +/- 25mph
- Board Weight : <20 lbs
- Board Lengh : +/- 37 in
- Rider weight and height : [spoiler] 6'3'', 210lbs[/spoiler]
- Terrain : Sketchy city road with some hills
- Use : Commute to work
- Single drive with capability to upgrade to dual drive
- Budget : <1000 USD

## My first build list

After spending long hours reading you on this forum, here is my first building list for my futur SPARTAN _beta_:
_Am I really allowed to give it a name at this point ?_:sweat_smile:

**Skateboard parts**

- Deck : No idea yet, boosted board clone maybe (any suggestion ?)
- Trucks : TorqueBoard 218mm 
- Wheels : MBS All-Terrain Longboard Wheels 100mm 
- Bearings : Deville Knucklehead Bearings ABEC 9 
- Truck spacers : No idea yet

**Mechanicals parts**

- Motor mounts : TorqueBoard or Solidgeek 3d printed mount 
- Belt : HTD5 12mm  but lenght will depend of Gear Ratio
- Drive wheel pulley : No idea, will depend of Gear Ratio (36T ?)
- Motor wheel pulley : No idea, will depend of Gear Ratio (16T ?)

Any suggestion for the best Gear Ratio ? @onloop, not sure to fully understand your guide [here](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/beginners-guide-to-building-your-own-electric-skateboard-drivetrain/53) 

**Electronicals parts**

- Remote : Nano Remote from TorqueBoard  or any other suggestions ?
- ESC : TorqueBoard  VESC
- Motor : Turnigy Aerodrive SK3 - 6374-192KV  or TorqueBoard  Motor 6374 190KV
- Wires and connectors

**Enclosure**

- Most likely 3d printed 

**Battery pack**

For sure I would like a 12s setup to be able to get the most of the 6374 motor but maybe 10s is enough ?
I would also love to get a Li-Ion pack but it might be to expensive...  

If you keep in mind that I would like to be able to upgrade eventually to a dual 6374, what would you suggest ?
@barajabali 
If I plan to build one, what would be the materials cost and could someone help me building it in Montréal (ie : spot welder)?

For a LiPo set-up, I'm thinking about 4 x ZIPPY Compact 5800mAh 3s 60c Lipo to start (12s1p, 5800mAh, 60C).

**Cost**
+/- 600 USD without battery pack and without shipping

## Your suggestions ?

- Deck ?
- Gear Ratio ?
- Remote ?
- Battery set-up ?

Thank you guys and _bonne journée_

Hello,
I'm not so new. I have ben following forum for more than a year. I got in GroupBuy with Jlab which was very nice experience. Recently, my Evolve bamboo died with failed battery; it is a pity, because everything else still works. I'm very motivated to build my eboard now. I'm logging my build progress, and will make the thread when it's done. The parts for my build are:

10s4p battery
2 maytech vescs
2 maytech motors
2 set of pulley and wheel pulley for flywheel
4 set of old flywheel; these wheel outlast Evolve bamboo's battery :smiley:
1 battery enclosure from psychotiller 
1 deck: RAYNE SAVAGE V2 LOLO

Let me know if you have any suggestion. Thanks!

Hi everyone, I'm Johann from France.
A few month ago I started reading stuff everywhere about electric longboard, after a few months I jumped in and made my first electric longboard with everything holding under my board with ducktap, I love it.
Okay it's probably not the best build but if anyone is interested I can post pictures.
I have posted some on my instagram already.

Sorry for my english haven't been using english for a while.

Hello all, coming from Minneapolis, Minnesota.  Been lurking around for awhile now trouble shooting and checking out others setups and accessories to adapt to my own build;
-Bamboo green giant longboard
-caliber trucks
-76mm downhill wheels (nice and wide but is more wheel for motor to turn).
-VESC 50amp
-spectrum 2CH (soon to be solidgeek remote, awesome job bro!).
-eflite power90 320kv
-pulse 6s 5000ma 45C
-3D printed custom Motor Mount
-3D printed gears, use mostly 1:1 (38tooth)
-3D printed T5 10mm wide (TPE&TPU)
-3D printed custom "top side" enclosure (board was far to low to go underneath also wanted more protection from debris and puddles while getting more airflow).
-3D printed accessories 
    *7in shark fin mounted in back
    *Ed Roth "rat fink" 5in tall mounted in front (still looking for a "super fink").
TOP SPEED (so far)= 28mph (used iphone gps app).

Mostly it's a Frankie-Stien non-standard build from parts eithor on hand or made, other than VESC which learned the hard way after blowing castle pheonix 100amp sky high, blew 22gauge solder joint right off, oh yeah and flames which had to hop off board and blow out.

Will post build elsewhere in more detail with pics and vids.

you always need to remember not to pass the 60,000 to not frie you vesc... but i do not know if you use 2 motor with 2 vesc (one as a master and the other as the slave) it´s not going to affect that?.... i am going to make my build with a 192kv with a 10s1p lipo (5Ah).... theoretically it´s going to give me like 24 mph and a range of 18kms.

so yeah i think you are goint to be right with this setup..... i will do this and after some time upgrade to two motors... but keep in mind that this motor is 74mm lenght.... so probably need to buy a mor big truck.... or go with 6354 i think two of those can fit well in a 180mm truck for the pictures that i seen

NEW MEMBER ALERT**** UNUSUAL PURPOSE for ESK8

Hey all, Rey here, digging these pages - I am working on a transportation device for old people that needs to be speed limited at about 2-4MPH. I have a dual hub motor (kv90), 2x VESC (2.18) 6S 40C battery.

Can I set the VESC to slowly accelerate to 3mph and maintain that speed? (no hills!) Is this the best set up for that purpose...(note** I'm stuck with it now!!) 

I want a wired throttle so I got a thumb version for scooter with LED display. Just waiting on parts. Pretty excitied, appreciate the help in advance given the steepness of my learning curve!

best

Hello Peeps, I found this great site after  buying all must stuff....darnit. Looking to make my first DIY board. 

I got:

TURNIGY AERODRIVE SK3 - 6374-192KV BRUSHLESS OUTRUNNER MOTOR			
YEP ESC 150A (2~6S) SBEC BRUSHLESS SPEED CONTROLLER			
ZIPPY COMPACT 4500MAH 6S 35C LIPO PACK		

From what I have been reading I think the YEP ESC will not work for ebarods, it may not even be detected by the receiver. I'll try and let you know, otherwise I'll get the VESC, maybe from HobbyKing? 

My motor has a circlip. We never take this off right? 

This is gonna be fuN!

Hey ladies and gents.

bought a $35 longboard off ebay in spring and hooked. stumbled upon electric ones and all i want to do now is build one.

have a 40in pintail with 83mm wheels but although decent for $35 i want everything new to my taste and style

going to build over the winter. Cheap is expensive and expensive is cheap so taking my time with the goods.

Mostly for a comfy smooth ride. Not going entirely for speed.

39-42in Bamboo Drop-Through Deck. Micro Drop possible depending on wheels and clearance. Dont wanna be too high if i can help it while being safe with batts/vesc/motor
Probably Paris V2 with rake for divey turns. 44~ rear. 50~front.
Love my 83's but will probly go with 90 or 97 wheels. For smoothness and safety over debris.
SK3 6474 Motor or 6364. Or possible Ollin 6380. Hearing great things either way. Probably sticking aroud 160-200Kv 

10s or 12s. Prefer high voltage to lower amps for efficiency and battery cycle life
Researched batteries alot. Panasonic/Sanyo 20700B 4250mah have low voltage sag. 4000 actual mah at 10-15a continous from reading Mooch's battery testing. Google him for battery researching.

Either 10s3p,12s2p or 12s3p all depends on how the board looks and fits with the configuring.

Looks like the FOCBOX is great choice. Durable. 
Want to run FOC for noise.

A compatible motor mount for Paris trucks.
16t wheel pulley and 15mm wide belt for sure. Motor pulley no preference. Want decent torque for hills. In buffalo, flat for NY state but some inclines here and there. But would like 25mph actual flatland top-speed and im 180lbs

Edit:

Also going to build another for the lady. Good idea if you have an active girl, if you travel anywhere you can sight see cruising the coast,parks, or anywhere see fit. make adventures. Also a good spare for a friend.
Probably a very similar build.



Ill be around though. Just saying hey

I think the esc will work, but the zippy compact doesnt have such a good rep, and also check for clearance for the batteries as you have a single pack and that would probably be a bit too high. And if you ever decide to get a vesc, get one from tb chaka enertion or some other people, the vesc from hobbyking is out of stock right now and nobody knows when it's going to be back in stock or how it performs, and never ever take off the c clip from the motor.

Anyways, you should create a post and show some pictures! Everyone would love to see your setup.

Hi, I wish to build an E-board but I am very mechanically challenged. Struggling with understanding batteries and how everything works together. Is there anyone who does consulting on builds?

@akaJarviss  well there is the chat window but I think it will be hard to answer everything there.. your best bet would be to go through many topics.. especially useful should be the [Guides]

In short.. There is usually a choice between Lipo or Li-ion battery. Li-ion batteries (ready made or home built) might usually cost quite a bit more compared to lipos.. but then again lipos has its drawbacks in other areas.. mainly due to increased cell balance drift (I would say, - not as stable, easier to mess up by not checking voltages compared to li-ions).. but then again lipos are way more power dense - you dont need as big pack to get enough / decent power out of it.. where when going with 18650, you might need more 'elements' / cells to reach the desired power output level..

Well.. to be honest I understood there is quite a bit of talk about it lol.. 

Maybe u should also just go on youtube and search lipo vs li-ion and similar topics..

How to charge batteries and the different types of connectors is another topic into which im not gonna go into here..

What you should know from the start is that.. the battery you gonna choose depends on what sort of controller are you planning to use (not all controllers support all 'battery types', or more precisely - voltages).. 6s is usually the lowest people go.. while more 'premium builds' (if you can say so).. go with 10s or 12s to achieve more speed/less heat / more power or for the simple fact that most commonly used VESC 4 (sort of best controller you can get for esk8, not to mention its next iteration - vesc 6) dont do well with high speed motors at high voltage. 

This does not impact vesc 6 as much.. but I still thought to mention it since people probably gonna be using vesc 4 for quite a while..

As about how 'big' battery you need (in terms of capacity - useful energy it stores).. there is a special calculator for that which can estimate your range.. thus you can adjust the numbers to reach the desired range (though I would advise to always include 20% reserve, as it is best not to deplete battery fully and which can be quite harmful especially for lipo batteries)

Tool is here, but u might need to read a bit more to understand all the tech talk..

A few more info piecies might be also found on his site:

One more topic which might be useful for you:

http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/how-to-choose-batteries-for-your-project-info-guide/27160

What i also forgot to mention - lipos might be harder to incorporate into your deck/box.. as they usually come in 'brick shape''.. I would just advise to start slowly and you will get the hang of it over time.. though it might require some time till you get fully into all of the concepts related to batteries but you can always go and choose some sort of 'template' build.. so you dont have to think that much about everything..

I think some sort of standard could be at least 5ah (5000mah) pack, with 20-25c rate and 6s.. everything higher will yield better results.. u should check on your own what each of these things mean ;)

Hey all. I am living in Maryland and got my first esk8 for fathers day this year (my wife's mistale).  I have longboarded for many years and loved DH. Anyway, my wife got me a lectric longboard for $299, which was actually a steal for what it is. The only issue is that I wanted more. After many hours of ghost reading on this form I made an account and somehow convinced her it was a good idea to build one. 
I have an Ehler switch ninja, sk3 190kv motor, ollin VESC  (still waiting),  and I am building 2 6s4p from Samsung 25r so I can charge using my hobby charger (I will have the wires exposed so I can charge without removing the batteries), madmonkey mod GT2B, and a KYDEX enclosure.

I do want to say thank you to everyone who has posted on here. I definitely could notbhave done it without the help of this form! I will be sure to return the favor once my build is done.

Hello eSk8 Builders,

My name is Andrew in the Boston area and I just wanted to say Hi and introduce myself.  Ive been skating for most of my life and in my 40's now.  In the last 15 years I have slowly stop skating all together because of work and family commitments.  I recently started riding my short board and having a blast but love the idea of building something to be proud of and just getting back to carving and burning up the street again.  This would be my first build.  I have been on this site for only a few day and really have seen some AMAZING builds, really awesome. I love the Trampa stuff and plan on building a Street Carver.  I have so many questions and really don't know where to start.  I'm on a bit of a monthly spending limit so I can only get a few things every month until completed.  There are a few builders that I wanted to base my build off of, @Eboosted and @Kaly .  Really great work. I have read that kaly is a great resource if you reach out, and there are a few things I would like to purchase from him as well.  I was also wondering if @trampa was a rep?, again I am new and DON'T Know anything and hope I am not stepping on anyone's toes.  So if anyone has any advice to start off with I'm open to ideas.  also I'm good with my hands and have built or had my hand in just about everything you can put together or build but an eSk8, I am sure to run into a bunch of problems to solve.  So think and I really appreciate all of you out there and thank you again for all of your leadership and knowledge.

Howdy,

I recently decided to get into building an e-sk8 after doing some research on lithium batter technology (because I want to build a portable water mister for the summer here in Vegas). While doing that I ran across jehugarcia's youtube channel which taught a ton about batteries, but also plugged a couple cheap cells on ebay, so I bought 200. It was more than I needed so I started to look for other things to utilize the batteries (including a super loud Bluetooth portal speaker like the SoundBoks).

I am piecing things together, and have the board, mount, wheels, and pulley/hub. I bought some fiberglass and carbon fiber cloth and will be putting together an enclosure. I am not certain whether my batteries I have will be best for the build since they seem to be limited in amp, so was hoping to start a post and get some feedback on those (I guess I have to be approved before I can start a new thread).

I think since my batteries are 10amp continuous / 20amp max I'm figuring 12s/3-4p and not sure if I want to run with Torque 6355 vs 6374 yet.

Hello esk8ers,

been around for a while now, but never introduced myself.
I live in the southwest of Germany, in the early 40s and used to skate in my teens.
After buying myself a Longboard last year and riding it for a while, I felt the urge for more.
So I watched youtube videos to get an idea what I would have to do and found the enertion website.
After torturing the Supporter on their Website with my questions he said I should go to this forum to get the answers I wanted. 
I've built two running esk8s with the help of this awesome forum, but they were more prototypes than a finished thing. So I never showed them here, because I was too ashamed of how they looked like. I'm trying to build a proper esk8 now, without taping everything together. :smiley:

My names Mikey, ive been driving a ridiculous amount ever since i left school and i just want out of it... I used to skate constantly but being sweaty everywhere i show up isnt good for work haha.  Im a computer instructor so i thought id throw my hat into the ring of a DIY... but honestly id rather buy someones diy to study... i would never have time to actually assemble a board i work so much.  But a board like this would be so handy for me to commute to the different locations i go to.  

I was really hoping for a mentor of sorts to show me the way.  Like i said i am a computer instructor so i promise nothing will be to out of my brains reach...  Ive been trying to make a good board with at least 800 bucks... again id rather buy one... anyone wanna lend me a helpful hand?  If you help me make one and you are in the bay area to literally give me a lesson, then i will pay you for that lesson haha.  Id love to have one of these boards and i know the boosted board the most reliable retail board and even that board is poop when compared to a good diy.  

So, come on... dont be shy... lend a fellow skater a hand.

I don't really know, but the first thing I would try is get some 5s lipos, wire then in series for 10s and see how it goes.  It shouldn't break anything as the voltage is the same.  If nothing else you'll get more runtime but I think you would get higher speeds as well because if the j creases amp delivery.

 For my first build I think I want to use those 80mm Leopard motors ( I am new remember). I am begining to understand that there is an ESC better than VESC for e mtbs because of higher current. I need to learn about that kind of stuff. What do check out.

Hello everyone,
My name is Chris and I'm located in Germany.  I'm into building an electric longboard since I've test rode one a couple of weeks ago. After that I've been doing a lot of reading and research and decided to build a fairly fast city cruiser with good torque. Therefore I will probably use a two motor setup. I'm an electric engineer with knowledge of pcb design and power electronics development/research. So I decided to build my own battery and some VESCs based on the original layout... Hopefully it will all be finished soon. :slight_smile:

Use Ackmaniacs firmware and app then set the max speed to your desire. PID control is another option that comes to mind. Torque is controlled by your motor and battery max current settings.

@ELLIOTTMORIARTY 
That was actually a reply to @reyx question from earlier in the thread. To answer your question, there are many hub motor options but not many that I would call reliable.   The best hubs on the market per my experience and  and opinion are Carvons, Hummies and Torqueboards brand hubs. The Enertion FOC box is likely your best bet for speed controllers and a 36-43V (10S-12S) battery pack with high current output(4P at least) is highly recommended as well.

Hey everyone,

I have been a fan of eskates for a long time now (big Casey Neistat fan), but didn't get much into the topic since the prices for a ready-built eskates were forbidding for me. As a uni student I needed a method of transportation and since I had no driver's license so I decided to find an alternative method of transportation. I have been lurking and reading in these forums for about a week now and finally registered an account to get some help from the members of this forum. I won't go into much detail since I will make a separate topic for my build & any questions but, here is what I think I will do:

2x 5200mAh 6s (22.2V) 10C batteries in parallel 
1x 280KV 1510W Brushless Motor

Trying to go for a 35-40km/h speed with 15-20 km range. We'll see how it goes. Currently deciding on the ESC & trying to find a compact RC without needless features that is not too expensive. Any recommendations/ advice for my build? Thank you!

Yes it does, but 6s amps are half as powerful as 12S amps so it pretty much cancels out as far as I understand.

You also mentioned you wanted to run hubs and those can require a lot of amps depending on which you choose. As a rules of thumb, get batteries that are capable of outputting double the number of amps youbexpect to draw. That will help reduce the stress on your batteries and maximize their life expectancy and their performance.

Hi All,

Im just starting my first eskate build. Its going to be a cruising board with super torque. Im a big guy from a small town and want a reliable board to commute around town and over English countryside hills. Not looking to break and land speed records here, its just got to haul my fat ass about.

My plan is to start with a 6374 and the highest gear reduction i can fit. Buy wide trucks, batteries and other components ready for a dual motor setup. Trial and error till i find a gear ratio that can handle taking me up hills with ease. Then double down on motors and switch to dual rear 6374, allowing me to half the ratio and gain some more top speed.

I already have the first motor  + VESC and im waiting for trucks, mounts and an assortment of pulleys to arrive. Just need to find the stiffest deck known to man which can handle some serious abuse. Aiming for an end result similar to an Evolve GT but with enough torque to win tractor pulling contests.

In my experience more range might be better than more power, which u might not use.

I would suggest sticking with 45 - 60A, and get 2.5-3ah cells..

Might add a couple more kilometers / miles

There are a few topics but with longboard u might not see more than 400w constant and about 1000w burst. I would say get your first board running.then u will see what u need more.

In my case that was range, as 8ah pack at 6s was not enough (having a, mountainboard)

Though 123 wh / 12km or more might be enough for u but i personally think 15km / 10 miles should be minimum, so.it is possible too go both ways and.not.charge as often

Hello guys (and girls!) I'm Nicolas from France (hence the nickname!)
38 years old cook, living in Paris.
I've been rollerskating at a more than average level and skateboarding for pleasure since I'm 10 old.
After monthes of research on internet, trying to improve my knowledge on the topic, and a lot of reading here, I eventually feel like I'm ready to craft my first  DIY esk8  and I'm about to order the requested parts.
It will be a 4WD switchable to 2WD pintail on 70 mm hubs. ( to preserve the range of the battery)
Here are the parts that retained my attention:
- Maytech 70 mm hubs 450 W kv100 22 A max( they are advertized at kv 60 but Eileen from Maytech told me that they are currently rated kv 100)
- 2 Maytech dual ESCs, each ESC rated at 30 A (so 4 times 30A) ( using VESCs would definitely kill my budget.
- Home made 10S4P flat li-ion pack, probably not soldered but using the Vruzend system for the 4 cells in parallel packs, then the P packs linked together in serie with wires (copper?) in order to preserve the flex of the board and integrity of the cells. (Will buy them from NKON)
- About the BMS, my choice isn't done yet but i was thinking about a 60 A max discharge current, ( thinking that a 4WD configuration will barely ask to the hubs to rise above 15 A each (that will also keep the batteries under 15 A discharge current, so HG2/R25/VTC6 will all handle it and stay cool, as the 10S4P isn't huge for this config, And will also prevent these small hubs from over-heating... (BMS from Bestech or Supower)
- About linking the dual ESCs to a single remote, the best option seems to use a Y cable from a single receiver (According to Eileen)
-About linking the Battery to the dual ESCs, Y cable as well, and same for a single ON/OFF switch running it all....
-About the deck, i really consider building an "all built in" wooden deck from an existing blankor from scratches. I'm currently trying to figure it out and engineering it, but i'm quite confident as i've been doing a lot of woodcrafting by the past and mostly have all needed tools. I want no plastic case on this board it will all be wooden. But I 'm conscious that making it flexible, resistant and esthetically pleasant is a real challenge...
Now here is my main concern about this project: I really want to get close to a 15 miles range with 4 hubs (450W/ 22 A max each) and a 10S4P pack ( VTC6 could help), and this is why i'm trying to find solutions to easily switch the board from 2WD to 4WD... As far as I understood the few topics on this, it requires a 3 channel remote https://hobbyking.com/fr_fr/hobbykingr-tmhk-gt2b-3ch-2-4ghz-transmitter-and-receiver-w-rechargable-li-ion-battery-1.html?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI1dmamrSb1wIVEomyCh2UuALnEAAYASAAEgJkwvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.dsand a ON/OFF radio controlled switch set on the wire linking the emitter and the front dual ESC... But i'm not sure of it... Plus... This remote from Hobbyking is simply ridiculous. Could anyone help me on this side, telling me if this: http://www.maytech.cn/en/maytech-mtskr1712-e-skateboarding-mini-wireless-remote/11032.html can make it as it is said to have 80 channels ? (I don't think it's the same "Channels" they talk about... My ideal would be to a set a captor that would automatically check the RPM from the rear engines and would turn the front engines ON below a given RPM but keeping the front dual ESC iddle  when 4WD wouldn't be used. So The 4WD would work only for torque at start, climbing, and perhaps braking?....
Please guys feel free to give me any advice about my wishing list... I know that many of you will tell me that buying chinese parts is risky as they are said to be a bit crapy but it seems that Maytech has a fair reputation for mid range supplies right?... My alternative would be the cheaper Meepo parts ( But I'd like to stick to the 70mm hubs for esthetic and weight reasons)   I simply don't have enough skills and tools to customize engines, and my budget is limited... Any help with the engineering will greatly be appreciated! I have woodcrafting skills but my electronic skills are close to zero... Cheers guys! have fun!

Thanks for your encouragements Okami! Yes I've noticed that @Ackmaniac seems to be one of the guys to go to for electronic solutions here... I'm sure there's a decent way to get this done propely, not expending the costs too much... I'm still drawing 3D plans for the deck and will let u guys give me your comments and potential concerns in a proper topic. I found a blank deck that would probably be a good base to serve both as a molder and skeletton for the board. http://www.ebay.fr/itm/Ridge-Skateboards-Naturel-Mini-Longboard-Deck-Skate-en-Bois-skateboard/381934532244?hash=item58ed127694:m:myFX9Q1503eXyxIF8pfXLGQ . I will reduce its tail to keep only the first two drilled holes for the truck and drill two other ones closer to the center, to keep the board under 100 cm (approx. 38') and with a little bit of this: https://www.roarockit.eu/shop/fr/placage/130-7-plis-placage-cruiser-%C3%A9rable-canadien.html,  it should be possible to add extra height to the board at the bottom in order to hide all the electronics (i'm working on the inner structure) if any one knows a better place to find cheaper but still functional blank decks or veneers in EU  please let me know! Cheers!

My name is Brian I'm from Jersey but born and raise in Delaware. I create custom skateboards you can find me on instagram here [Boney Boards Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/boneyboards/). Been on here a few months starting to think about the parts I am going to put on my first build.  I have decided I will use the FoxBox even though it seems like the best deals have been had after enertion canned there bulk discount. Racerstar 50mm motor 200kv with some kegels, custom motor mount that a member here is doing with idlers.  Trying to decide on LiPo or Li-ion for the battery I'm thinking 10s3p  but I have found all the premade packs of Li-ions I have seen online are just far out of my price range.

Hi guys
First project here, your thoughts will be very welcomed:

- Caliber Trucks
- Torqueboards Mount and Motor: 6355 260Kv
- 16T x 36T
- Zippy Batt 5000 20C 4S (02) (or 5000 4C 3S much better?)
- FlyWheels 93mm
- Still haven't define VESC (any recomendations)

To get 45 Km/H and descent hill ascension

Is it 20C to low for battery? 
what about nanotech batteries?
Whats your experience with torqueboard?

Any comments will be very appreciated guys!

Haven't used the mount for the batteries I've heard some not great things about the zippy compact and had not great experience with the multistar (but others claim they are fine).  I currently run Turnigy 10S 5Ah 20C (2 x 5S 5Ah in series) and has been fine for over a year, typically I draw about 10-20A at most (6374 149kv turnigy sk3, 120lb rider mostly flat).

Have heard the nano-tech are slightly better from quadcopter people but in the context of eskate I don't think you typically draw that many amps and are usually running at much higher voltage so can deliver more watts with less amps.  Have been happy buying most my components from  a supplier of torqueboards stuff but have the older vesc, mount, and kit from them.

No prob. The motor has been good for me and is well over powered given I'm a small rider and land around me is pretty much flat, but no issues with overheating or anything and is a big honking motor.  Regarding motors and voltage make sure you search around about erpm limit on the VESC since over 60k erpm or 8571 motor rpm can blow the DRV chip on the VESC (assuming 14 pole or 7 pole pair motor).  Basically if you know your voltage can divide 8571 by the max charged voltage to get the max kv that would be "safe"

^^ is good to get an idea of speed as well

Hello all!

My name's Mike and I'm just now mentally committing to build my first board, so I'm putting that intention out to the world here =p

I've built and raced fpv drones for a couple years and was impressed by how many of the skills, especially with regard to building, will cross right over from that hobby to this one. That pushed me to jump in and get my feet wet much more readily than if I'd had to start fresh learning electronics, like I did when I got into drone building.

I'm currently in the "lots of reading phase" of getting into a hobby. So, my plan:

I haven't begun choosing parts yet (and welcome any input) but I have a pretty rough idea:

I have a mixed mode commute where I walk, get on a train, walk, get on a subway, walk, get on a bus, and finally walk some more. Because I'll have to board trains, lightness in materials is going to be a focus for me, and may put me at a bit of a price premium, but that's ok. I'll have to carry the board, potentially for long periods if there are train delays (happens often enough to plan for). My work then has me regularly moving around Cambridge, MA-USA, which I usually accomplish by walking and bus. You may see why this mode of transportation appeals to me.

So definitely a limit on board length and deck materials, which I'll figure out.

For a drive train I lean toward hub motors, though I'm not particularly sure why. I think from an engineering standpoint putting the motor in the wheel appeals to me, though I'm aware of the infancy of the tech and the variety of opinions on the topic. Whether it's the right choice in reality, it's the one that initially appeals to me most so I'll at least pursue it.

Seems like people are satisfied with 2 wheel rwd? Again I come from quadcopters so I came in thinking "of course we'll have 4 of everything!" But that appears against the grain - it also contributes to weight I can potentially do without.

So I'm looking at 2 rear hub motors with basically a very well thought out (thinking not yet done) battery pack - I'll need to find myself the right balance of size, weight, cycle length and speed. I've yet to come to a decision on how often I plan on recharging, whether batteries will be swappable, etc. Any suggestions on any part of this plan more than welcome.

Do I sound like I have no clue? Imo I initially need a 30000ft view plan for things, then part picking will fall into place based on suitability for my criteria.

Let me know what you think and I look forward to being part of this community, you guys seem great and I look forward to sharing this hobby with you! 

-revise

Hello, my name is OLnewB. That's not my real name. I have been skateboarding, roller skating, and inline skating most of my life, since I was 7 years old.

I actually like kick pushing a skateboard for exercise. I sometimes push up moderate grades when I don't feel like carrying it.

My current favorite setup is between a longboard and a skateboard. It gives me a wider stance than a shortboard, and a kick for crack ollies. I ride a HoodWood WildCat 35" x 9" deck with a 17 inch wheelbase between bolts, 21 inches between axles http://www.hoodwoodskates.com/wildcat-13.html, Bear Grizzly 10 inch trucks  http://beartrucks.com/?products=grizzly-gen-5 with Venom bushings, http://venomskate.com/barrels/ and Seismic Landslide 75mm 79A wheels https://seismicskate.com/product/75mm_landslide_wheels/. This setup rides like a dream. My son calls it a hoverboard. It spits out rocks instead of stopping on them. 

So I want to build an electric skateboard. I will use a 36 inch dual kick deck with nice soft wheels. I will build a single drive and probably expand it to dual drive. I enjoy moderate speed. I enjoy the stoke without the dread. I have crashed too many times. I use my hands, arms, and legs to feed my family, so moderation.

I bought an OM5065 200kv motor from Ollin Skateboards @chaka http://www.ollinboardcompany.com/product/om5065-200kv, a motor mount from @marcmt88, a very cheap 18650 10s2p battery as discussed by @scepterr https://www.ebay.com/itm/NEW-LG-36V-4-4AH-BATTERY-PACK-18650-EBIKE-VAPE-POWERWALL-BATTERIES-20-CELLS-BMS/172630688902?ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT&_trksid=p2057872.m2749.l2649, Caliber 2 44 degree trucks https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00NY42714/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1, and a full face helmet! https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00E5QK5TQ/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1

 I need pulleys and belts, a vesc, charger, controller, enclosure, deck, wheels.

I really appreciate all the help from members of this forum.

Thanks @GrecoMan. I really want to build my own pack with better cells etc. but I saw the thread and was wondering if 10s2p would move me at all. I thought this puts out 20,amps continuous? The Meepo Board uses a very similar pack https://meepoboard.com/products/battery-10s2p-36v-4-4ah-samsung-18650-5c. I'm tempted to buy another at $35 but I'm spending more money away from my desire to make my own pack. Oh well.

each pack is limited to 10a continuous but the BMS’s aren’t great so running at max continuous will heat them up and probably blow them up.  I personally LOVE my 10s6p.  i can get like 25 miles out of it

Hey, i'm new to this stuff.
Due to regulations, it's a problem for me to ship an assembled esk8 (I'm from Israel), So i'm trying to get the parts and build it myself.
I've researched, but I come for your help today. I need recommendations to buy - a parts list or something like that. 
I'm looking for something on the low end, that will get me to and from work. Nothing fancy.
I'm not afraid to build myself, buy that's not the priority, so if there is any 'conversion kit' worthwhile I won't have a problem buying it.
I have found several builds and offers, but I wanted to ask for a full part list, including all the tools or small things you might assume I have, because I probably don't have it ;)
Also, I need to find sources that ship to Israel (I saw mboard and  ships to me. Amazon is more problematic and probably not an option)
Thank you so much for your help.

Thats a really good point, I didnt think of that :confounded:!  Could a possible work around be a transformer in the housing? Granted it would charge slower due to decrease in amps but thats not really a problem for the convenience it would give.

Edit: Just remembered DC vs AC... DC wont work with a transformer.

Edit: Could I use a boost converter?

40 year old dude getting on skateboards for the first ti.e in decades, lol. I'm 6'2" 250lbs fairly athletic build. I'm in search of am off-road board, so far Mountain boards looks appealing. Long boards with all terrain wheels looks alright too. 

I've done more research on Mountain boards than longboards because most decks can support my weight. I'm just looking for a direction to go for my first board. 

I've had some advice so far here on mtb's and I'm still not sure what to get. The Trampa 690e looks fitting, but the "build my own" method with MBS boards looks good too. 

I'm still looking around....

Hi All,
Im Ryan and Ive been lurking around this thread for half a week now and I've been casually skating/board riding for 3 years now and I love cruising and maneuvering my board all the time using kicktails, I got a small cruiserboard almost like 28" in terms of length.
For the past few weeks I've been hyping so much or electric skateboarding and Ive been looking around on pre-built Eboards and what ive found that caught my eye was the Riptide R1 and R1 Elite, as of now it is under kickstarter inside US and I live in the UK which is quite not so Ideal for my ongoing expenses. The Boards spec ans size is so perfect that I almost bought one while not thinking right so Ive decided to log on to reddit threads and ask about any recomendations on saving less and enjoying E-boarding, to cut the story less, Someone gave me a suggestion to built one on my own and saw his cruiser build and I got sold on planning to make one now. To make this project successful and not as a cancelled plan Im trying to write this one and ask for help to build one for my self and might as well help me out on building my very own Riptide version. So, these are the check list Im trying to make:
**-** Fish shape Kick tail deck 28" length 
**-** 8-10 Mile range 
**-** Dual Motor belt(open for debate to stick with one instead or go dual)
**-** 18-20 MPH speed( for safety)
**-** thin decent built remote with battery indicators
**-** 20% incline strength 
**-** possible water resistance for I live in UK. damp wet roads are common with gravel that will possibly trip you with your board.
**-** get an all terrain wheels such as "MBS all terrain wheel" which is 100mm

Overall fun and safety is a concern, and the compatibility of everything is a must for I don't know much about troubleshooting any basic circuitry. Hope I can get help with suggestions, Im going to put a check list of parts or leave a link for the final ideal part for my build.

Hi everyone,  I have been trolling this site for a couple of months, learning how to build an esk8.  Thanks for all of the information. I finally finished building my new board.  I have been skating for 30+ years and riding my new board is a total blast.  I used to get looks riding my longboard because I wasn't some young kid -- now I am getting people stopping me asking what the hell am I riding..  Riding an esk8 is way better that the skateboards we use to build with gas engines on the back, with no brakes.  Thanks again for all of the information,  <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/3/6/360da3b1744596d1c8a8626cd9617aae22e89682.jpg" width="650" height="488">

Hey everyone, I built my board using torque boards parts, I bought the big 6374 motor with 190KV. I have a single motor setup with three 4s lipo batteries wired in series and the vesc from torque boards. The board worked perfectly at first and was scary fast. I then put an on and off switch on the board. I cut off the xt90 connector on the vesc and soldered in the on and off switch. The other end of the on and off switch is soldered into the connectors that connect the batteries in series. Everything turns on, remote connects, motor spins, but not at full power. I get a failed motor detection. There is no fault codes, the motor will spin when I try to detect it, but not at full power. I don't know if y soldering is bad causing the connection to be bad, or if the vesc has an issue. HELP?

New member here, Ted.
 Along with my wife Norah we own Roarockit Skateboard Company. For those that do not know Roarockit manufactures a DIY skateboard building kit. We have been around for pretty much 15 years and are passionate about building boards and helping people get into board building.

I know very little about electric boards but as an avid board builder I am always interested in the many directions our passion of building things lead us in. Eespecially you who laminate your own boards and enclosures as I think I can offer suggestions and help once in a while with this.

Off the top I think it would be fun to come up with a DIY laminated board kit that would be specific to an electric build but I will need to know a lot more than I do now to make this happen.

I have made many interesting boards over the last 15 years. Here are a few.

Top two pictures are pinch boards. Specially laminated, the layers are unbroken through the board without voids or inserts. This technique makes crazy light and strong boards. Don’t talk much about these boards as the technique is still under development.

The middle two pictures are of a classic luge board that presently holds the world speed record in this category. Classic luge is a wood laminated board, no metal and no carbon or Fiberglas.

The bottom picture is of a sculpture I built many years ago for an art show in Hawaii.

I am not into pushing what I sell to others on forums so I will be respectfull of not posting for the sake of advertising. Really want to learn about what you all are doing and share my knowledge.

Thanks
Ted

Hi y'all, I don't really have a plan but thought I'd say Hi as I been lurkin' round reading and absorbin' for a while now, (thanks for all the amazing info and thanks for sharing it here,) anyways my names ADi HD ,I split my time between Innsbruck Austria and Cambridge UK. my recent intro to esk8's came when I found a cheap enough Koowheel D3m (I know,I klnow, but before you all lynch me please read on) for £300 from a kid who'd had his first hard slam and got scared off (I think his mum made him sell it, poor lad), I then proceeded to strip it and try it out on different decks and have settled on this one for the moment, an old 80's powell deck for £2 from car boot sale, having said that I'm already looking towards the next one, 
Thanks for the great site folks,                  <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/0/b/0bc393a4a607f1597521d3845e21a6678cbbbb74.jpg" width="690" height="459"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/0/2/021d6eff6a980ca65082c6abe352698ee72d7573.jpg" width="690" height="459">

Hello comunity my name is Bobby Belanger. I’m new here but not new to eskateboards.  Built several boards back in 2009-2010 with salvage razor parts then salvage exskate parts and maybe some Eglide stuff.  I thought of starting a company “ NYPB “ (New York Power Boards) but was not dedicated enough to take it that far.  I probably built the first board with Lion’s built into the deck back in 2010. I didn’t know much then and blew it up within a few weeks but it was hot shit for a minute..😝
My last build was about 2012 running on 4 Makita batteries.  18mph and unlimited range by my perspective.  I rode that board for amost 6 years untill last week when I called its time of death.  
 Currently I have a Meepo on order and just bought the roughest boosted board I’ve ever seen on Ebay.  
 I’m diving back into building but starting with re-building the boosted.  
  Additionally: I Build/Fly/Crash FPV race drones and have been building a few bluetooth speakers.
  🙄 no ones going to read all that...
How to get pics on here..🤔<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/a/6/a6f5e36c05c3c73dc903efede077f547244040d0.jpeg" width="375" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/3/7/379c1bef6f032d9819011429db6065fd47c8404c.jpeg" width="375" height="500">

@Detonatedfrost  Cool story. Im always amazed when I hear some folks were doing this a "long" time before it got as "mainstream" as it is now.

..Even though still half the world hasnt seen or heard much about eskates, besides the big metropoles, of course.

Anyways, nice to hear you are "back on track" and ready to pursue this trail again with "newest technology" :)

The biggest development I’m excited about is the VESC with a GUI.  I use advanced ESC’s in my drones with an incredible GUI  (BLheli 32).  I’ve watched BLheli develop over the years.  Looks like VESC is on the same path. 
 
My biggest disappointment is that quality remotes are still allusive.

Hi. 

I'm **Sean**. 

Wellington, New Zealand. 

Skateboarding for the first in _25 years_ and love my electronic gadgets (ESP8266 FTW!) so motorising my longboard seemed like the logical step. I have a 2-3km commute through the CBD at 6am in the morning so it will be a very fun ride each day.

Ordered the HobbyKing Turnigy kit a month and a half ago and it's just turned up. Can't wait to put some bits together tonight and make my maiden voyage to work tomorrow morning.

Have already built a controller that emulates a nunchuk (untested without a VESC for 1.5 months) but will use one of the Winning Remotes (US$30 on AliExpress) for now. PPM will be OK until I get things sorted out. Will get my HM-10 working soon too for some logging/configuring on the fly.

Running my rig on 2xTurnigy 5S lipos. Only 20C so might not be super powerful. Will probably set the VESC up for a 10A limit as I'm more interested in "maintaining" my speed than accelerating. Roll-on "cruise-control" with the faux-nunchuk!

So cheers for all of the articles/topics/posts that I have been reading so far.

choosing how much kv will depends on how much you weight. With a 28 inch deck, meaning smaller wheelbase and therefore there is not a lot room for battery and ESC. Don't let this scare you tho. When I started, I absolutely don't know shit about circuitry. But lurking around help you learn... a lot. 
Trucks....this is tricky. 28'' board will, I assume, have 7-8 inches in width. And a normal caliber truck 10 inches from axle to axle will look weird on a 7 inch board, unless you like that then get caliber truck. I'm in the process of buying paris truck. I will let you know what motor mount will fit what not.
Motor: if you weight 200+lbs then go with 190 kv or less. 200+kv means more speed but less torque. 
esc: what's your budget? because turnigy esc is fine I guess but I recommend torqueboard's VESC or focbox from enertion.
battery: since you said you have little experience with circuits then go with lipo batteries. BUT since you want waterproof board then you have to put it to consideration that WITHOUT BMS, you will have to take the lipo battery in and out to charge it INDIVIDUALLY. So do research and consider what to buy. I recommend you research 18650 batteries and go from there. 
remote: I never went deep into this but I'm sure you can get a cheap one from ebay
pulleys: either 3d print with strong filament or you can get a kit from amazon or torqueboard, whatever cheaper.
wheel: 83mm or 90mm or 97 mm flywheel clone on amazon would be ideal.  
BEFORE you buy ANY of these, please post your plan so people can help you confirm that they would all work together.

Hello! 
I've been skating for almost 7 years now, and a few months ago I stepped onto an eboard for the first time (At a demo for inboard). Since then I've been thinking about getting one and now that I've found this community I've decided to jump in and make a DIY e-board. My engineering experience includes a robotics class when I was in highschool and some model rocket building. I want to build a board for fun as well as for commuting. 20+ mph, 10+ miles range, and something that can handle small hills (budget is $500-900 USD). 
I have some boards lying around that I could use, as well as access to tools. 
I will start making a build list soon, I think I still have a lot more reading to do to know where to start.
Looking forward to sharing the adventure!

Hello!
I'm looking to build an electric skateboard as a side project during school, but would like advice on the build before I buy. I put together a parts list but am not sure about the battery or motor size. I'm afraid the batteries may be overkill and am unsure of the kv for the motor. The most distance I would need would be around 4 miles (though more would not hurt), desired speed: ~25 mph or 40 kmh.

 My name is Andy I am a Marine, 61, about 290 lbs. and never been on a board. I am desiring a electric mountain board - starting with a deck made of 9 ply maple (maybe the center ply different color). The deck will be slightly different to handle two channel trucks to the rear and one truck to the front. I want two motors, maybe four, need power and distance (20 mi.) Where speed is not that critical, about 10-15 mph Not sure of the board length at least 42 inches. NEED some input on the shape of the deck. I want to mainly cruise around and learn to carve and basic boarding skills. I am here to learn how to do this, so I will desire a lot of input from you all. I am on  a veteran 's disability pension. So I expect the project will be long and slow. So let's begin.   ;-)

Hi, 

My name is sk8l8r from Scotland, I've owned a Bajaboard for 2 years now and have had to replace a cell and add a BMS this is when I found this site, great reference resource!

I also got myself a meepo swapped that on to an 80's reissue powell deck and now im hooked, my build plans include

* 1 x 10s5p belt and 1 x 10s5p hub (both 2WD looking forward to testing the whole belt vs hub thing in detail) diyeboard kits
* 10s3p 70mm hub 4WD (hoping the 70mm with 4WD might make this a almost skatepark capable deck) 
* an undecided project that takes my Bajaboard battery and a few other parts I will have spare when I upgrade my G3 to a G4 (or as close as I can) planning something with FOCs)

Sir, I strongly recommend getting a strong cheap used non-propelled popsicle board first and just riding a few meters now and then wearing wrist and ellbow protection. This will be good preparation while you build and you will get a lot more fun out of it once you go electric.
Get some kid to show you how

Hello my name is Kai. I have experience in hobbyist electrical such as car audio, computer building and general electronic repair. I plan to build an electronic skateboard for transportation to and from work around 20 miles round trip a day. I plan to build my own battery pack from VTC5 18650s somewhere between 12S2P-12S4P configuration for the necessary battery life tho I haven't yet made any calculations to determine how long it would last based on 2600mah * the 24-48 18650s. I have put together a parts list that I imagine won't work with the trucks currently installed on my board but that is fine I can get new ones if need be... For now I just would like to query the compatibility of the parts I have accumulated through research here and other places. If someone who has eyes for this would give me advice it would be much appreciated thanks in advance!

What VESC or ESC are you using to power the motors. Many VESC's have had problems at 12s and I've heard its best to stick with 10s to remove any potential problems with heat.

I plan to use a focbox and want to use 12s to get as close to the max voltage as possible. I imagined if it's stated compatible with 12s Lipo that it would be compatible with 12s lion because if I remember right Lipo is higher volt but honestly I have no experience with Lipo whatsoever and every where I have read it is inferior to the performance of lion so I didn't bother with much lipo research. Let me know if there will be issues with 12s and the focbox if there are because I like it when things go smoothly in my projects lol!

I just looked it up and the max voltage of the focbox is 50v. 12s is 50.4 with Lion batteries. Is that .4 enough to cause problems? I could probably add a component to reduce the input voltage a little if necessary but it's always good to know in advance...

we finally cooked them!

It only took about 4 months. And it wasn't because there was anything really wrong with any of the components, one of the big caps broke a leg due to vibrations and bounced around shorting everything.

Pneumatic tires make all the difference. A powered board is leg tiring, vibrations are killing your feet very fast going long distances without a break for your feet/legs. Riding trails, off road paths and back lanes is just ace! Pneumatics simply widen the potential usability tremendously.

Hi all, I am new to the forums and plan on building an electric skateboard. My benchwheel dual 1800w died on me a month ago and i plan to scrap the board for parts except the battery. i plan on choosing the right battery and vesc that compliments the motors well and hopefully i’ll be able to post my progress on here! Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

I have been browsing this forum for a month or so but I only found it after originally building my board. I used to be big in RC planes, cars, drones etc so I used my pre-existing knowledge when I picked components. I never even rode a board before a month ago but I'm already looking for more power, speed and reliability. Here is my current build.
![IMG_3556|375x500](upload://6mxF1RPK0ePpBTwOERGagXhOmLq.jpg)
I used a cheap motor mount kit from Amazon http://a.co/9ohqF9u and a cheap ebay 50mm 270kv motor. 
I currently have a VESC and 2x3s lipos in series for 6s and 83mm flywheel clones. I have another on the way for a 9s setup. 
Even after divoting the truck for the pointed allen set screws AND using RED Loctite (the stuff you're supposed to have to use a torch to remove), I'm having problems with the set screws backing out after riding over expansion cracks and brick (worked fine for a while on asphalt only though). My current gearing is 16/48 for an approx 19mph top speed. 
I'm looking at getting some caliber trucks and the diy/torque boards caliber 63mm bracket with their improved sprocket kit. 
My main question is should I go for the SK3 6374 192kv or 149 kv? I ride up some decent size hills where my current setup struggles a bit. I'd like at least the same top speed but preferably 25-30 mph if I can still get enough torque. I only weigh around 150 pounds. 
I was thinking 
9s/ 6374 192kv and 14/36 gearing? Approx 21 mph (same as current)
9s/ 6374 192kv and 16/36 gearing? Approx 25 mph (maybe not enough torque)?
9s/ 6374 149kv and  16/36 gearing? Approx 21 mph (maybe good torque/ efficiency and 12s compatible in the future)

Last thing is how is the quality on the torque boards mount and pulley setup? Any problems with things coming loose after riding over brick and on concrete sidewalks with expansion cracks? And does their 12mm belt stand up to the torque of a large single motor?

How will the torque boards VESC stand up to 9s with these motors?

Thanks again, this forum is a great source of knowledge

i am from brazil, what make the process of doing diy eletric skateboards a pain in the ass.
1)our currency is horrible, we have to pay at least 3/4 times than you guys from europe/canada/usa/australia.

2) we dont have national suppliers, all the parts has to be imported from others country, which is majority of China (of course).

3)the delivered of this parts could be delayed ate least 3/4 months by our Mail Agency, so, patience is the more import part in this process.

 
i started with the turnigy hobby king skateboard conversion. so far so good by the way..

Hello My name is Michael, I have been lurking and reading for months and just really want to get started, with a really nice reliable electric board, with all the information I have gathered I have come to the conclusion (unless someone wants to steer me in a different direction) is to buy a board from trampa.com and in my cart right now is

16ply 35º HOLYPRO - STIFF 		  	
154Kv TRAMPA Motor -  		  	
14 Tooth - All Round gearing 		  	
Nah - SILVER Springs are cool for me :-) 		  	
RED DAMPA's - 80a Stiff Steering 		  	
8 Inch BLUE Primo ALPHA Tyres 		  	
NO Heel straps Thanks! 		  	
NO Bags Thanks :-) 		  	
MAYTECH rechargable Remote & Receiver - Small size Thumb Operated

maybe this link will work to the board I have in my cart for a month.

I am 180lbs I want some good speed but want to get up some pretty decent hills also.

I would have maybe already purchased this but,

My problem is the batteries they recommend are not available and for this first one I just want the board to work right, I will definitely be custom building them in the future. Any recommendations, If I need to build one myself I will but I have just read a lot of experiences that end up burning parts up and

Hey All!!

My name's Roman. Live in NYC and i just recently got my first beginner board at the end of November (Genesis Hellfire V.3) 

And so far I've been riding a decent amount every week. About 35-40 miles or so a week in fact since then and its been great! 

Now i think I'm ready for the next step up but I want to see what i can upgrade this board to really be one of a kind. I already have a deck swap planned, and mainly am interested in what i can do to boost the top speed by a little bit. 

I'll be making a thread with my ideas and questions later tonight.

Hope to meet some of you IRL on the road! :)

Hi everyone 🙋🏽‍♂️
My name is Manny. 
I just recently got interested in these DIY electric skateboards that you could make yourself. I thought that was pretty awesome because I need some sort of transportation getting too work. I started too watch these DIY videos & at first I really didn't know what anyone was talking about in their videos. So I watched more & more videos then finally got too this website, read a lot stuff that I needed answers too & I can say I feel pretty confident on my first eboard that I'll be making here soon. Just waiting on my parts too get delivered by end of this month. Thank you for this site. So far I feel like understand  partially 😊 Pretty excited !!!!!

What's up everybody! Brian here from Hi5ber Boards. In case you haven't heard, I make some of the sickest fully carbon fiber longboards/skateboards available on the market. I started making boards back in 2011, and have made considerable progress with my manufacturing and the business since then. I've designed upwards of 25+ models, pushing out 6-10 or so new shapes each year. I have a strong passion for 3D modeling and bringing my CAD designs to life. I repeatedly get emails from customers looking to convert their Hi5ber board into an electric one, as well as looking for any recommendations of which of my existing boards would be best. I joined this forum to get some input from the electric skateboard community on developing a DIY friendly "shell" of a board, designed specifically for electric skateboard builders. I think we, as a collaborative effort, can make the ultimate carbon fiber electric board!

Hi Team,

1st post, third build. I'm coming from electric motorcycles and bicycles, and recently rediscovered my love of downhill skateboarding. Never thought I'd be alive to rip around on a 40kmh powered skateboard, but here I am. I live in Oakland, CA if anyone wants to shred with me.

I'm riding an Earthwing NLS, dual motors, with a chinese dual ESC (I bought two VESCS from DIY but neither is working - no lights). My next build is a Landyachtz wolfshark dual motor with VESC's if I can get them to turn on.

Lastly, when I log in, there is no option for posting "new topic..." I can only reply. I swear I'm not a total idiot, please advise. xx. Da_gree

Thanks for the greating. I'm kinda in the same boat with the enclosure the 121c has some flex even with their stiffest board. Was thinking of some type of interlocking enclosure that allows some articulation. Although, mounting the battery also brings up issues. Every thing in my build has to be as compact as possible since I'm only dealing with 19 inch wheelbase. Challenging but not impossible.

Hello,

I'm Joe, machinist from SoCal USA.  I have been recently evaluating my expenses and am not happy with the fact that my commute to work is my 3rd largest expense.

For a normal work week, I'm spending ~$830/month on just gas and tolls.  My insurance company has informed me that the reason my rates have increased by a factor of 4.3, is that between May 2015 and May 2016, I exceeded 50K miles.  This also explains why I have been killing cars.

I am 9.1 miles away from my preferred Metrolink train station and my place of business is 1.3 miles from the station.  I am no longer working excessive overtime and the train is again a viable option.  I have been skating an old school Sword and Skull twin-tip for at least the last leg of my commute.  Unfortunately, 45 years of skating some serious long-distance mileage has taken its toll on my body.

I have seen various motorized skateboards before but never seriously considered one until I saw a banner for Boosted, while lurking the Mustang forums. 

My immediate plans are to purchase a production board for the mean time.  Something with enough power to handle lugging my 240lbs up the gradual hills and can get me out of trouble while riding in the entitled OC traffic.  However, I feel I need to start on a board with more forgiving braking and acceleration as I have never ridden motorized skateboards and I don't really know what to expect.

Of course the hot rodder in me will never be satisfied and always want to build and modify.

I look forward to growing and learning with your community.

Cheers,

Joe

Hey I have had a pre built board for a bit. I am about to build my own. I have done a far amount of research so far.  I would love some real world experiance and input any and all is welcome. I will outline what I think I have narrowed it down to.  I want a decently fast and powerful board nothing record breaking but sold. Motor wise single motor 6374, been looking at torque board and maytech as possible options?  battery 10s2p or 12s2p possibly 3p 4 p seems like alot of batteries and although range is important 15 miles plus would be great. VESC for the speed controller. is there a difference between all the different people selling VESCS? these are the most important areas I would like input in the deck wheels and such seem to come down to preference.  So if you have any suggestions or input i.e. best place to buy batteries oh 25r or 30 Samsung batteries?

I'd like to take the beginner route first & transfer things that work okay onto something that works much better for me. An upgrade if you will.  I wasn't quite sure about this whole e-skating thing & if it would work for me; so I bought the beginners intro into the sport = yes, I bought a Chinese Board.  I thought after doing so, I would find out if it was worth further investment.  I'm not really good with electronics/wood working but really want to learn :man_student: (*like most of us here I'm sure).  

How does one go about upgrading the esc/VESC of a board?  :mage: Is it easy to do?  I can't seem to find a definite answer after lots of seeking on the site (great site this is!).  I'd love to buy the focbox but don't think my re-build would be worth the cash.  Is there an alternative VESC someone may recommend?   (Specs for my current board are listed below)

The motors are hub motors & I want to put some Sidewinder Trucks on the board (like the Evolve) :star_struck: https://www.gullwingtruckco.com/10-gw-sidewinder2-1-orange.aspx for great handling but can't because the Koowheel trucks have notches that fit on the hub motors...  :disappointed_relieved: Would this be something that can be done?  Do I need a special drill/tool to do so?

Another idea that I can't figure out is how to get the battery / esc to be separated with a set of wires instead of a direct plug in style.

I want/need a stiffer deck as the esc/battery setup is supposed to be rigid & I weigh too much so the board flexes & might cause disconnect issue in the future.  

So, any ideas would be great help & if you're in the San Francisco area, lets get together & skate or build.

Hey nice setup; what's that foot holder thing called (I know it's skyhooks but what model do you have)?  Does yours work well & why only 1 (usually I see 2)?  

I like the bumper in the front - had a longboard split the front wood once when I bailed & it hit a curb head on.

It's the Freebord S2 binding, only need it in front cause that's the foot I need to stay attached to the deck 😋, on a trampa or other mtb deck I would use 2 cause the stance is different, your weight is more evenly split

Makes for a great handle too 😉

Hello. 
I'm from norway, and i am planning to build my own electric skateboard during the rest of this winter.
I have a longboard and are looking to buy cheap parts from ebay/china to see if i can make an electric skateboard. Is it okay to tell what i plan to use of parts here and get input, or should i start a new thread when i am able to do that. :thinking:

I would recommend getting a high 100kv motor (170~190kv) so you can upgrade to 12s. I would also use a Vesc if I want to eventually upgrade. Why buy cheap components if they eventually break? :grin:

Where do you find that? Vesc seems to be optimal for 10s though. There is no absolute way to prevent vesc from frying. Vesc 6 seems to be fail-proof, for now. 😏

I'm from the UK, 15, and want a proper stealthy look so I don't attract attention. I'm probably going to use HG2 cells and a simple ESC and some basic dual hub motors from China. I might try to make the components fit into the deck or experiment with a VESC to use an app on my phone to check stats, but I have a tight budget of £200 or slightly more so this is unlikely. Opinions? Thanks.

Hi there, new guy here.

I have owned a magneto for a year now (first gen). It never broke to my surprise until now. The battery has died in some weird way. probably the bms is faulty. I decided it's time for an upgrade.

got myself a VESC and 2x 3700mAh 6S zippy compact wich i am going to run in parallel.
I only have 1 problem. I don't want to use a bms again and i already have a 50W 6s charger.

I don't want to charge the battery's in parallel so i came up with this schematic. anyone that can confirm this is going to work without blowing up? [Schematic](https://imgur.com/a/vHMXZ)

I can select wich battery i want to charge with the 2 switches. It is save to switch as long as the loop key is not inserted because there is no power flow. I'm just worried about the negative leads that are in connection with each other.

Hi! 
I've got some doubts about what you said. why the 170~190 kv would be better? it would have a longer range than a 270 kv? but, even if the bigger range the 170~190kv would have a smaller top speed, right?
sorry for the lots of questions!

A sub 200kv is best if used with 10s or 12s packs. Yes they would have slower top speeds, but you won't break the erpm limits on vesc which is safe for 190kv 12s. If you are using 260kv, I would suggest using 6s.

Hi I'm Tony from nw UK. Been lurking for a while, reading and drooling over many of the builds in here. Last month after a lot of deliberation I took the big step of ordering the parts for my 1st build. I'm a tall guy (thin but heavy) so wanted a powerful setup that can handle my frame. My build list of parts purchased already is :

40" dropped deck 
Torque Boards 218 trucks
Dual 6374 sensored 190kv
15/40t - 15mm Belts
ABEC 11 97mm
10s5p (30Q cells) with BMS
Maytech remote
Enertion FOCBOX x2
And a whole bunch of other bits and pieces to complete

Hoping to have the actual board built, but not wired or configured, by next weekend. All very exciting 😁

Hi, I'm Jan, from Brno, Czech Republic. I do a lot of kiting, including kite landboarding. I recently got the idea of making my mountainboard into a convertible electric mountainboard. Let me explain the "convertible". My favorite kite landboarding spot is ~8 km from my place. I normally drive there. I would much prefer to go on my mountainboard instead, which would be much more fun... as long as it has a motor. But then again, once I get to the spot, I need my MTB to be lightweight so that I can use it for kiting. I'm hoping to build it such that the motor/battery/electronics are easy to add and remove again. I have some ideas about how that could work, which I'd like to discuss here.

Hey guys! I'm mostly into 3D printing, VR, and mechanical keyboards. I've been a longboarder for over 20 years now and used to race downhill competitively. I still follow friends who race, but I just don't take myself to those extremes anymore. Watching the flow of the sport of longboarding is fun over time. When I first got into downhill, the landyachtz DH race was the hit new drop board- then some years later the much more balanced Evo hit the scene and made a ton of sense. Then top mount boards became more and more common, JimZ speedhangars went by the wayside in favor of Aera trucks... Maguns never really picked up any steam. Now and for a while now it seems people are into freeriding more- hardcore downhill with tons of steezy drifts and shit. When I was racing, 83mm blue kryptos were the shit when it came to drifting and slides, and Avalons / Avilas were the shit for grip along with other hard edged wheels. Orangotang started up... Anyways I could go on.

I still ride around, but have been into computers more since orangotang started and my plan is to build on one of my Rayne downhill boards, 2x 6374 190kv, 10s4p battery, dual focboxes, psychotiller enclosure, gear it for some speed and reignite my passion for longboarding in the years to come... With some torque under my wheels this time!

Hey everybody :wave:

I'm just putting together my first DIY eSk8 after pondering it for a few months. Like most people I guess I watch Casey and think that looks great but I don't live in NY, how practical would that be where I live? I've been into RC for many years and run a IT company so understanding the high power battery systems, brushless motors, esc plus the tech aspect is not much of a big deal. That said I'm 42, 95kg and haven't ridden a skateboard since I was a teenager. So it's taken me some time to decide if a eSk8 is right for me. I do a lot of small trips to my office in my SUV and a large part of my work is in Cardiff City which is becoming more restricted for cars all the time plus there's talk of implementing congestion charging like London. So I'm hoping learning to ride a eSk8 now will put me in a good place for the future. Now I could have just bought a Boosted or something (I can afford it) but if it doesn't work it's a lot of money to spend on something I might have trouble moving on in the UK. So I've decided to build a DIY eSK8 with el'cheapo Hobbyking lipos and eBay stuff. Yes it won't look pretty and might have issues but if it works with my lifestyle and I don't kill myself then I can splash out on something better later.

Here's my parts list so far, please tell me if I'm missing something :slight_smile:

<i>...Bugger, my parts list is on my Mac at home and I'm in work :-( I'll update later.</i>

Hi guys, great content on this site!
First build for me. Hoping to build an emtb with my son.
I’m posting here hoping to find some good input.
Anything you have for me would be greatly appreciated.
So the parts list that we’ve already purchased is:
10s4p enertion spare battery pack with Samsung 30Q cells producing 36v and 432wh.
2x focbox
1x enertion remote.

We’d like to get the direct drive system from no wind.
And and have to source the motors. We’re thinking of getting 2x sealed 6374 but are not sure which ones. And of course the board… I like the trampa…
Located in Switzerland so any supplier info would be great. I can also get products via USA…
Let me know what you think,
Can’t wait to complete this, hopefully before summer kicks in…
Tony

Hi guys,

I'm Tartopom from France.
I'm already an old fart on the esk-8 scene but never managed to register on this community.
I started years ago with the first Evolve Carbon, then moved to the DIY and built one of the first dual diagonal setup in 10S already 3 years ago...time flies.
Then I moved to the ONEWHEEL as it's a hell of fun beast :) then the onewheel+...
Then sold my DIY setup and bought an Evolve Carbon GT which I sold few months after.
And finally, now I'm the proud owner of a huge beast, a Bajaboard G4X which is a monster in all terms.
I also pre-ordered a raptor 2....already many months ago that I plan to use in the city while I keep the Bajaboard for offroad (living in mountains).

Hello everyone, I'm a graphic designer, I'm Spanish (sorry for my English, sometimes I have to use the translator), I skate for 13 years and recently a friend introduced me to the world of eboards and at the moment I have an Acton blink s I want to modify, but later and with more budget I would like to build my own skateboard.
I would like to know which is the right thread to be able to create my first post asking how I can change the battery of my current eboard.
Any advice for novices will be well received!

Search through the Eskate electronics category with the search word battery, batteries, 
Then after much research, if you don’t find an answer, post a topic in the Eskate prebuilt category

Hello, I'm from Ohio, I am re-building a Mototec 1600w off-road board. I am soliciting your advice on what to put on it. I also use it for golf (makes golf that much more fun). I have even mounted a bar to hold my bag, gps, phone, speaker etc.

What I'm looking at doing is: Keep trucks & wheels; then replacing with a custom subsonic carbon board. I want to keep the motors as well. I want longer runs on the board, new batteries, new VESC, and a wired controller (preferably a thumb throttle on handle bar). 

What VESC, batteries, throttle, what should I get?
Current motors: 
Model: MY8919
Voltage: 36V
Rated speed: 3000 RPM
Rated current: 18.4A
Output: 800W

Current batteries:
(3) 12V14AH/10HR lead acid

Hello everyone, I've been reading up on a whole bunch of information in this forum since last year but haven't gotten around to making a account until now! Partly due to the fact that both of the eboards I bought last year are starting to break down on me. 
Maxfind C - it's 10s1p is wearing down prematurely because the cells it's using samsung 22p don't provide enough amps for the motor. Right now the battery pack only lasts about 2 miles. I'm planning on swapping the cells with lg hg2 using the stock bms. ![20180207_214757|281x500](upload://ffUVL4MvcrhIXWy5TT2mGHHDlVD.jpg)
Blitzart hurracane gt - there's so many problems with this board that I just decided to buy a whole new one all together. More on that later. 
     First thing that broke (twice) was the battery nickel strips ripping from the shock of riding. The battery pack isn't entirely secured in the enclosure so you need to open it up and do that yourself. ![20180124_144003|281x500](upload://2ldJy6CqZXA8VKGMFS7SDFRUnLu.jpg)
     The nuts that hold the enclosure and trucks together loosen on their own (I'm sure everyone gets this problem if they don't use locktite) they don't come with rubber gaskets so I have to find my own. 
     Enclosure isn't waterproof. Water got in and zapped part of the esc that caused the left motor to lock up. I removed the left motor and replaced it with a normal wheel and used bearings as spacers to keep the wheel from shifting around on the motor mount.
    The most recent and dangerous one is one that happened last week.![20180328_102157|281x500](upload://w6FlrFhKoRxpir9HcGg7vS66cNg.jpg) The front truck split in half from rolling over some cobble stone at around 12mph. The metal used to mold the front truck is disgustingly grainy. I have since replaced it with cheap caliber trucks that makes the board feel WAY more stable than it ever did on the old trucks. ![20180329_200021|281x500](upload://cEihv0ropGFP2dACkff8c69vlpV.jpg)
     I ordered the ownboard pro in hopes that some of the problems I experienced with this board won't occurs again and if it does, it won't be hard to fix. Battery enclosure is easy to remove, esc is water proof etc

Hi all! Been reading a ton of material here - great resources and discussion.

I have 2 phases of build coming:

Phase 1 (a bit off topic): Upcoming ankle surgery has set me on a course to boost a knee scooter. Using same type components as an eSk8: 6374 motor, VESC, Lipo batteries. Some distinctly different design points: looking for torque more than speed (<15MPH, not looking for a 25mph knee scooter!), large 7.5" wheels, different gear ratios. Trying to adapt knowledge base here for right design point. Any words of wisdom on design: what to do/what not to do?   

Phase 2: Reuse components (to max extent possible) for eSk8 build. Traditional type build.

Hi All,

I purchased a KooWheel Kooboard (D3M Gen 2). I live in New York City and I am curious to how the board will handle (hold-up) in this environment.

Looking into the Verreal V1 (https://verrealboards.com/products/verreal-v1-four-wheel-electric-skateboard-with-swappable-urethanes-for-hub-motors)

Playing with the idea of making an AWD board... 2 ESC; 2 Batteries; 4 Hub Motors
Worried about weight of the board vs. power

I will update with some pics in the future.

Whats up dakrug1, Im also in NYC. I have a board using the same motors as koowheel from their previous generation and its held up fine so far in the wet and cold NYC environment. Form what I understand, the 2nd gen Koowheel doesnt have sealed motors so water can get it and wreck it. Dont recommend using it in the rain. Also 1 more thing, dont use your board or any skateboard when there's ice melting salt on the road. It will cause the metallic parts on your board to rust in a matter of hours (even worse for you because your motor isnt sealed). 
You'll have enough torque and speed to get you anywhere in the city. The range with the speed mode locked to 18mph should be great, 12 miles im guessing.

The Verreal is basically a meepo board 1.5 with a stiffer deck. I dont know how good this company will treat it's customers because its a pretty new company. If you're looking for other boards in that price range, Check out Ownboard, Wowgo2, and meepo. They all look the same but ownboard's got some really interesting stuff under the hood.

Hi all,

New here, just starting my build. Through my work, I have access to 16S (A123 26650) Lifepo4 battery packs and have wired one to this "[Smart BMS](https://bmsbattery.com/bmspcm/834-smart-bms-10s13s-60a-with-blue-tooth-android-or-ios-app.html)" that reports via Bluetooth. We have purchased the VESC controller as our pack fully charged is 58.5V which leads me to my main question; Our plan is a single motor belt driven setup, will most motors be able to handle the higher voltage? I notice most here use 12 cells max.

Oh I just wanted to see what the cheaper end of the spectrum is like. I see the great use of VESCs but the price makes it unapproachable for newer people like me. Furthermore, I have not found any good reviews about the esc. So I want to see what it is like. (Note: I will eventually upgrade to a vesc when I plan out the perfect board.)

My name is Hoyt. I came here after doing research on purchasing an electric skateboard as an alternate means of transportation while my car is being repaired. My research led me to purchase a Backfire G2 and it will be here next Wednesday. That said, I'm really excited. I am also interested in DIYing my own  moutnain board at some point as well and wanted to learn as much as I can about the topic before I begin that process.

Hello good people of esk8,
I'm joining as i'm starting my first build. Past two years been splitting my time between riding a boosted d2 on the streets of nyc and an unpowered surf skate just mucking about. I really dig the deep tight turns and general maneuverability of the surf skate and I want to add a motor to it. The idea is to make a light, fun, low powered ride for carving and cruising around the neighborhood. The loose carver trucks make it unsuitable for high speeds anyway, and the power needs to be smooth as possible, so i'm thinking single hub motor build with a 30" kicktail deck. The focus is smooth power delivery and minimal weight.  This video is basically the ride I want. Figure I can build it for less then a third of the mellow drive they use.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&v=ohhk_9AhXB0

Can anyone provide a parts list that's current and available for sale? Many thanks to all the contributors.

Hi all, I'm Seb from Perth, Western Australia. I’m not sure how many people still follow this thread, but I thought it was about time I introduced myself. 

I've skated for a good part of my life and esk8 was probably just a natural progression. 

I followed evolve for several years and when the GTX came out I went into the shop to buy one and walked out with a Boosted Board.

I've done around 800km (500 miles), and now the extended battery is here I ride 30km (19 miles) a day to and from work. I find the boosted really stable at top speed, but the top speed slow. My sports tracking apps have my average over the 9.5 mile one way trip as 32kmph (20 miles per hour). So, for the majority of the journey I am just riding flat out. I love going fast, regardless of whether it be on a skateboard, longboard, snowboard, dirt bike etc... 

I am more mechanically minded than electronically minded, so I read for about 10 hours before creating and account, and now a further 8 hours before making my first post. If I had known that there was such a big DIY community and good product base, I am pretty confident that I wouldn’t have bought a Boosted, and just made my own. 

However, I want to keep the boosted for international travel. I’m off to Canada in June/July and looking forward to taking the board! 

I love aesthetics, and really enjoyed the enclosures thread from @eboosted and the Master Evo build threat from @Deckoz. 

So the plan… 
The specifications I want for my DIY board would be: 
Range of 32km (20miles) 
Top Speed of 50kmph (31mph) 

I have a lot of old decks laying around, and I nice solid sector 9 bamboo board with no flex that could be perfect. Otherwise, I’ll be looking into getting something new. 

I like my orange orangatang Kegels, so was thinking of keeping with the small wheel theme and getting some Purple Kegel 83s. So with that in mind. 

Dual 6374’s 190KV (still deciding on brand, open to suggestions – obviously been looking at @Torqueboards and @Jlabs) 
2X FOCBOX 
@Eboosted 12S Universal Enclosure 
12s4p batteries (Need to stop reading about 13s) (Have a friend that will be making the pack)

Purple orangatang Kegels 83mm 
Motor Pulley 16 
Wheel Pulley 36 
15mm belts 

I really like @longhairedboy motor mounts, but they won’t fit the Dual 6374s (Greatly appreciated the info Damon provided) 

There will be a lot more research before I start buying parts, but that’s where I am at. 

Thanks! 
Seb.

Hello, I'm Tom from South Africa. 

I did quite a bit of skating when I was younger but I want to build an ESK8 Board now.

The plan:
Range of 10-20KM
Top speed of 35kmph

I have a deck here, its a deck from my old Yuneec E-Go board and the battery is dead and wont come back to life.

I would like to have a build with Dual HUB wheel setup instead of having the motor on the outside.


It would be amazing if you guys could send me a recommended part list for building a board with a budget of about 600USD

I'm going to do more research but would really appreciate your guys' help.

Thanks!

Hi Hi! So I’m new to Esk8 in general. I’ve long boarded but it was never really a daily thing for me. I’ve been looking for an activity that will get me out doors this summer and building an Esk8 longboard just seems fun. 

So I want my build to take into account that I’m 6’4  340lbs. I want to do a dual motor setup but have em off set like on the metroboard stealth. I want the price range under $1000. 

So far I’ve priced out some things and know what I want but I got to the point where I need to get electronics and now I’m lost.lol. So far in my build 

Longboard deck = $69
https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B00I4KKPVM/ref=ox_sc_act_image_2?smid=A1SOLJCI3089N9&psc=1

Just one off amazon that I like the shape of

Trucks = $92
http://avenuetrucks.com/longboard-truck/

I’ve read these need to be filed to fit the motor mounts

Wheels = $25.99
https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B01IBJ5ZFQ/ref=ox_sc_act_image_1?smid=A2DQMI7AS28KLN&psc=1

Comes with bearings and seems to be the correct flywheel type

Motors = $167

https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-aerodrive-sk3-6374-168kv-brushless-outrunner-motor.html?___store=en_us

I really want the 192kv motor but they seem to be sold out/ on back order

Motor mounts = $120

collections/electric-skateboard-motor-mounts/products/63mm-reverse-motor-mount-set

These say 63mm and look like the brand I’ve seen mounted to those suspension trucks. 

And that is where my parts list ends for now. Still doing more research on what drivetrain and electronics I want. But I do know I want to parallel my batteries for taking higher amps. 

Hi Hi!

Im 15, and i ride a 30" skateboard many times daily, but my ankles are wrecked and there aren't many nice pavements, so I have to work very hard to keep at a decent speed. I'm going to buy a cheapo 1 hub motor board for around £90, and a pintail deck, then somehow try to implant the electronics into the deck of the pintail. I only want  to cruise at 10-12mph so power isn't an issue. I might add another 6s in parallel to the battery or increase the voltage for more power or range.

Hey! My name is George! I saw an add for building esk8 in January and have been addicted ever since. I'm finally about to pull the trigger on parts though. 
My build:
-Dual belt ESC  (diyeboards)
-10SP battery (diyeboards)
-scsk8 drop down deck (amazon)
-N6354 180kv motors (diyeboards)
-97mm green flywheel clones (eBay)
-250-5M HTD5 12mm Belts (diyeboards)
-Motor Pulley (diyeboards.com)
-lipped bearings (diyeboards)*?*?*
-3D printing wheel pulley (80% infill)
-DIY motor mounts using brackets
-Using trucks that come with deck
PLEASE if you have any suggestions I would LOVE to hear them or if I'm missing anything peices. I should add that I have the ability to buy two Tacoma bigfoot 245kv 6364 (I think) (https://www.hobbypartz.com/96m608-bigfoot160-5335-245kv.html) online from someone on Reddit but the shafts we're totally round and that confused me honestly bc I wasn't sure what pulley I could use. I am making this on a budget so please keep this in mind. It's main use will be on campus and I'm not looking to go fast. I'm not super happy about the ESC (almost just bought a Wowgo 2s bc of it) and I'm not 100% sure the lipped bearings will work b/c it says on their website something like "bearings for our drive wheel pulley." I don't love that I'm buying most of my stuff from dieyboards but it's currently my most cost efficient option. Thanks!! Happy to be a part of the community!!

I'm new here, got into esk8 for commuter use.  Got an Yuneec EGO2, but stopped working and they won't cover it under warranty.  

I need to figure out if I want to repair, rebuild or replace it.  Or just use a bike.

Im an engineer and Ive been building E-scooters, motorbikes and Ebikes for about 15 years and skating for over 25 years. Ive built a few boards waaaay back in the day with heavy lead batteries. After winning a nice longboard at a charity auction I thought i'd tackle a new winter project. I love personal transportation that doesnt involve a combustion engine!
Im using Evolve GT trucks, wheels and motor mounts on a single kick longboard (39inch). I'll be using the high discharge A123 prismatic cells from my trials bike in an 8s configuration, that i can re-configure into 12s if i choose later on. I live in a pretty hilly area so I will be using dual 6354 motors in a fairly low KV. Ive started 3d printing my enclosures and once ive got a few bits finished off, ill start a build thread.

Also new here - been lurking for a while... :face_with_raised_eyebrow:

I'm gradually gathering the parts for my first build, looking for something for short trips around home (S. London based), running to shops etc. I'm taking it slowly and doing lots of research so hopefully I end up with something useful that I can be proud of - I love whitepony's builds so using those for inspiration, and looking forward to revisiting my engineering uni days.

So far I have:
Loaded Poke
Caliber II 50
Orangatang Kegels
30x Samsung 30Q 18650 - looking to build a 10s3p
Supower 60a BMS (on the way)
Winning V2 remote

I'm now deciding on:
Motor - 6374 SK8 vs Streetwing 6374 190kv
ESC - Hobbyking or Focbox - I think I'll want to run FOC to be less intrusive

Then final parts will be mount, kegel pulley and drive gear - Street Wing have been very helpful responding to my questioning emails and so I think 15/36 gearing sounds best. I'll probably make a build thread when I am closer to actually putting the parts together!

Any advice/thoughts are very welcome.

Hello all, Magnus here, Brazilian who fell in love with eboards. I'm trying to look at parts that are available locally so I don't need to import since it is too expensive for me.

Though of making a tread for it but I'll ask here anyways.

Wanted to know how much customization I can make to a speed controller. Wanted to input a max speed lock mode, and set it to some sort of cruise mode where it keeps speed without needing to constantly accelerating it. After some research I couldn't find an answer , is it possible to use an arduino board as a speed controller, given I program it properly? I'm asking since the arduino can have more features other than controlling speed, which would allow me to add other functionalities to the board.

Also wanted to ask if it is possible to implement some sort of non-rc speed controller with buttons and switches or other pressure based devices. My Idea was to add a switch/button on each end of the board (not very close to the edge), which when pressed would increase or decrease speed by X kms at a time. I would also add a security key like in a jet ski. It connects to the engine or the ESC so when I fall off the board the key (which is connected to my belt or any body part) gets disconnected from the board, shutting it off (unless anyone  has made something more simple and efficient that I have missed without using rcs).

Final question. Would it be necessary to add a 2w drive engine to lift a 170-180lb guy over some hills and 10-30 degrees streets. Also, the torque matters when cruising over bad streets with a lot of holes in it using 80-100mm all terrain wheels, if so how much more torque would I need to maintain stable speeds without forcing the engine too much.
```

Hello all, new member here. Im 23 years old living in Texas. Became very interested in the Eboard craze, but i had my doubts and concerns...so i bought the cheapest thing that would accomodate my potential riding needs. Bought DiyEboards cheap AT board, bc i would mostly be riding on broken concete sidewalks and dirt/grass. It was okay-ish for a beginner board and peaked my interest. Now im fully hooked amd plan to do the whole Etroxx Direct drive, Trampa board, esk3 6374 149kv(not too worried about top speed, may go higher kv in future but i weigh 260lbs so i dont think itll be overkill torque) 12s8P self build probably if i can fit it. Thx for reading

Hi All,

I'm Alex and I'm looking to build a board after buying an Evolve Bamboo GTX a couple of months ago. Nothing wrong with the Evolve, just want to try my hand at making something myself. Keen for something a little smaller and stiffer with a kick tail. It will also mean I can have a mate come along with me which is a bonus as well.

I wanted to get the skateboard parts up and running first, so have ordered the below:

Deck - Jet Deck Vulcan Kick 35.5"
Trucks - Caliber 2 50's
Wheels - 83mm ABEC Flywheel Clones
Bearings - Bones Super Reds

As for the Esk8 components I'm thinking:

**Motor Mount -** Hobbyking Esk8 motor mount (meant to not suck and only $10 bucks - see how we go)
**Motor -** Turnigy SK8 6374 192Kv sensored (happy to hear that sensored isn't worth it and get the SK3 which is actually in stock)
**Pulley (Motor) -** I've got a dead motor from the GTX with a 15T steel pulley on it - I'll see if it will work with the motor.
**Pulley (Wheel) -** I've got the original 32 tooth pulleys from my GTX after upgrading to the 38 tooth wheel pulleys, but I'm thinking these might not work due to them mounting directly onto the shaft of the trucks rather than being pulled into the wheel with retaining bolts. If they won't then I'll buy the hobbyking pulley set as it comes with everything I need for only $35 bucks (unless it won't fit the caliber trucks)
**Belt -** 15mm HTD5 - not sure what length I'll need yet - but as above if I can use the spare ones from my GTX I'll do that
**Battery/BMS/Enclosure/ESC/Remote/Charger -** I'm looking at buying either the 10s2p LG/Samsung kit from DIYEBOARD with the dual belt drive ESC and the two separate enclosures, or go for the 10s5p all in one kit in the single bigger enclosure. Not sure what quality I'll get from this but I can't be stuffed messing with LiPo's and can't stretch the budget any more than I already am given I spent AUD$2K on the GTX 2 months ago... The 10s2p will cost me AUD$400 shipped, versus AUD$500 shipped for the 10s5p version. This is the main area I'm looking for advice. I'm 85Kg and live in a hilly area - will a 10s2p be enough to feed my big motor and get me up the hills without murdering my range completely, or should I go for the lower quality but bigger capacity 10s5p kit?

Looking forward to hearing all about how my idea won't work so i can fix it all up before I spend the majority of the cash.

Thanks everyone :slight_smile:

Alex

Hello! My name is Max. I live in Russia, Moscow. 
A few months ago I bought a MEEPO board, and now decided to build my own board. 
First of all, would like to tell that I am snowboarding for 15 years so far, and this year would like to build a carving eboard. I am not keen on speed so much - 20mph is enough, as for the range I am going to cover about 10-15m. 
My plans are: 
1) loaded vanguard, 
2) Paris trucks (my choice instead calibers), 
3) kegels 
4) single 6355 190kv
5) DIY VESC
6) 8s li-po(???) 
Other parts are chosen, but I don’t think it is necessary to mention them right now. 
Thanks!

Hi, I'm DavidLee from shenzhen, China.Currently, I am mainly engaged in the BMS industry. I have developed BMS for automobile, military and general consumer equipment. I hope I can make friends around the world.
Attached picture is 6-10 series of 50A BMS with RS485 and CAN, FAE adopts TI BQ76930 and MCU USES STM32L151, which CAN be used as product application or for development and learning.

Hello. 
Names Kelly (dude) I just got a riptide r1 as a gift. Been an avid boarder my whole life. Grew up with half pipe in back yard and  a grandparent that still builds surf boards for a living. 
For whatever reason I've been holding off on getting into Eboards but I've been wanting to for some time.
Im happy with the R1 so far.  Been riding it daily for 3 weeks.  But I've never been a pre built kinda guy, so now I'm wanting to build something better suited for my needs. 
I've been doing some reading but I've always done better hands on.  I know what I want, just need to brake down the execution.
I'd love to start with modifying my r1. Maybe just new motors and a better battery.
But I'd like to build a fresh set up.
My eboard is my daily transportation so a second board as a back up seems reasonable.

Definitely want belt driven.
I'd like to be able to go 30mph+ or at least just under.
10mile+ range 
But the big thing I want to improve over my r1 is power consistency. I notice a big change in power after I hit 70% battery.
I've been reading but still feel a bit lost honesty.
Maybe I'm just tired. Working too much.


Here's my r1, had to change the grip. I can't own things and not customize them. Art is by ArtOfSkinner. Luckily I had a set of abec11
 Wheels from another board so I upgraded to those right away. I've got a set of abec11 superfly blacks that I'd like to try, but looks like I'll need to modify the belt shield.

Hey guys. I'm new in this form but I'm a long time longboarder and Eboarder from NYC. Started with metroboard dual motor (25 miles) and switched over to single motor board for more range (40 miles). I then got a boosted v1 dual and bought and Acton s2. I then started to try electric unicycles and bought a  gotway Tesla 1020 and a king song 14c. Now I'm building a mountainboard diy project. Setup is trampa complete mountainboard with straps equipped with a 12s8p 18650 30q Samsung batteries with charge only bms to dual sk8 6374 192kv motors on a 5:1 gear ratio direct drive on 8" tires. I'm thinking if getting the g2tb remote mod in the future When I finish my build.

Hey, I'm Steve.

I've never skateboarded much, but I've been snowboarding for ~15 years.  After seeing a boosted board on my walk to work, I decided that would be way more fun than walking.  But I didn't want to spend $1300 right off the bat, so I got a wowgo mini.  I just got it this afternoon, so I've maybe got a mile on it, but damn is it fun.  After I was done I replaced the trucks with paris 43s, haven't tried those yet.  Next is bushings, cause I'm ~210lbs.

I don't expect the wowgo to last much past it's warranty, so I'm looking to start building it's replacement now.  I'm thinking single 6374 or 84, focbox or maybe even a cheaper vesc 4.12 since I probably won't be running a huge amount of amps.  Battery either 10 or 12s3p, and I might look at LiFePo since my commute is very short.  Possibly using 18650-sized LiFePos with N.E.S.E modules, because I'm lazy.  12s for sure with LiFePos as I think the ones I was looking at were 3.2v reference.

My background is computer science, though I started out as an aerospace engineering major so I've picked up some electrical/hardware skills as well.  Not to the point of designing a PCB, but at least I know which ends the electrons flow from.

Hey, usertag Blitqz.  Just getting into the thought process of eskating, never really skated before, thus going for the longboard.

Likely I'll start with something like a WoWgo 2s with Sanyo battery, or something similar like the Meepo or Ownboard.

From there, all things depending on like, etc.... My plan is to build a board from scratch with an eye for top end quality components.  My only drawback at this point is the decks themselves and matching decks with enclosures since I can't find any longboards out there that have built in enclosures (which seems like it would be a genius idea - kind of like the torqueboard 29" on the DIY website).   

Thus interested in peoples opinions of what the best parts are from decks/enclosures, vesc, battery, remotes, trucks, wheels, motors, etc..

Post pictures of your motors/leads coming out of them.  Typically an ESC has the power input, on a FOCBox or VESC this is typically an XT-90 connector, large yellow one with large gauge wires going from it to the VESC.  The three wires that are black typically with bullet connectors are the "phase wires" and send power from the ESC out to the motor.  Be sure to read up before connecting things or attempting to calibrate for your motor and controller and post images of what you have for now.

---

Assuming you have a BLDC motor it should have 3 'phase wires/leads' coming out of it that connect to the three bullet connectors coming out of the ESC.  If you have a brushed DC motor instead of brushless (BLDC) then it will only have 2 wires and can't be controlled by a BLDC ESC (would either need a different ESC or a different motor, would recommend different motor if you have brushed right now).

6S is fairly low voltage for esk8, it might be good for starting off since things won't be as crazy in terms of top end but you also need more amps to deliver the same watts at lower voltage and more amps equals more heat dissipated from all your components (loss).  6S will move you fine but won't likely have nearly the punch also the higher amp draw will cause more voltage dip and more stress on the batteries... I'd strongly consider going with higher voltage or at least leave yourself room to upgrade in the future.

---

Also good while budgeting/planning to include any charge equipment you'll need (include power on/off or XT-90 "antispark loop key") and safety gear (for yourself and maybe some for your lipos while charging or laying around).

Buy a commercial board.  You will spend more making it yourself.  DIY is for "better" stuff, not "cheaper" stuff.  If you want hub motors I'm assuming low-price is your goal.  You can't beat a cheap china board for price, like the Meepo board.

Thanks for the reply! I wonder why I'm afraid of making a mistake to connect the engine to the focbox and burn it ...

Personally run 10S since I think 12S is just more power than I want to use on a board.  I started with 12S but burned up some cells in one of the packs (dropped voltage too low) so switched to 6S temporarily and was just a lack luster experience (on 149kv especially slow).  So think 10S is pretty ideal but would just say somewhere in the 8-12 range will be a better experience in general.

Hi everyone. I've been lurking for the last couple of months but today I fried my VESC. Have a Ollin vesc 4.12 HW and 3.38 SW. It's blinking red when trying to rotate motor and is giving the error code: FAULT_CODE_DRV. It's my DRV that is fried probably. Can I replace this myself?

Hi everyone! my name is Ash from Wales, U.K. Looking for a project to get myself busy with over the summer and have pondered over the mountains of electric boards currently on the market and have decided DIY is a good way to go to get my moneys worth! whilst also meeting some like minded and helpful people who most likely have a better understanding of how all of this works than me! haha no clear image of what im looking for currently but i'll be sifting through this great forum for some advice!

Thanks in advance guys!

10s2p or 10s1p? What charge rating would you recommend for the battery? 20c?
```

## \#1291 Posted by: wafflejock Posted at: 2018-06-19T23:15:11.281Z Reads: 122

```
Those things are tightly related but you mis-stated something there what you want to know is the 'discharge' rate not the 'charge' rate.  The charge rate is always basically 1C if they don't say otherwise which means you take the capacity of the battery in Ah and charge at that rate in Amps.

So if it's a 5Ah battery for example (which I use) then it should be charged at 5A at max (will also depend on if your charger can put out that much current without overheating and shutting itself off).

---

Regarding the discharge rate if we assume it's a 5Ah battery and 20C discharge rating (that's max discharge, shouldn't sustain having this much pulled from it) then you can safely pull up to 100A (5Ah x 20C = 100A) which I think is plenty.  Say you have 5 2S in series or 2 5S in series it's the same equivalent 10S so 37V nominal voltage * 100A = 3700W which is far more than the motor is rated to ever pull anyhow.  You don't need to do lipos in parallel if they are rated high enough, the higher the better though you will heat/stress them less and they will have less voltage dip under load (when amps are flowing).

---

Additionally the charge rate is important to be conscious of when it comes to setting your regen settings in the VESC so as to not dump too much charge too quickly back into the batteries, they can deal with more than 1C for a short period but don't want to push them too much.

---

Sorry for the book... one last thing to add the C rating can be BS sometimes so looking for third party tests of internal resistance of the cells from different manufacturers compared to their claimed C rating is usually the best bet.  Joshua Bardwell is an FPV geek I watch on Youtube who does some deep dive tests into different batteries/manufacturers and publishes his test data.  Roughly speaking from what I've seen the C rating does correspond to max discharge but manufacturers may fluff the numbers some.

Hey everyone, been scouring this forum for info ever since I started my build but just recently became a member.

My setup:

39" Loaded Tan Tien board ( flex 1 )
Paris 50° front truck
ABEC II 97mm 75a flywheels
Bones Reds bearings
CarvOn v4 TorqueDrive dual 75k 400w motors
10s3p 30q pack w/ a 30a supower bms
Maytech v4.12 vesc ( x2 )
Maytech wireless controller 

Still in the process of securing my enclosure but I have an idea in mind. Also just programmed my vesc's using project-vesc's tool as well as motor/sensor detection. Should have the last peice of the puzzle some time next week then I can actually start riding my board. Here are some pictures of my build:

Hi All,

I've mostly seen people riding Boosted boards around and I've wanted one for awhile, but so far I've never gotten to ride one.  In April I ordered a Boosted Stealth.  It's still not here yet, but already I want to tear it apart and modify it.  So I figured I better start building one of my own, otherwise I'm going to unbox it and have it in pieces before I ever get to ride it.  I''l post on the 'builds' thread here shortly, parts are already on the way.

I just started manual longboarding and I love riding downhill. So I thought why carry the board back up if I can make an electric. I've done electronics in school and building an EV sounds like a fun engineering challenge.

Hello everyone. MY name is Randy and I live in Kentucky. I recently purchased a used lift board in great condition for $40. Only catch is that it has no battery or ESC. So I have a board with wheels, trucks, and motor all ready to go. 

I'd like some guidance on which battery and ESC I can buy to get this thing going down the road. I'm not looking to spend a lot of money, or have the fastest board. I'm happy with quality parts that'll just get me cruising some sidewalks.

I have a beginners knowledge of how these boards are assembled and work, but I'm very good with my hands, and with a wiring diagram I'm good with electronics.

If someone can help me with recommending a battery, ESC, and any other parts or programs I may need to get up and running I will be eternally grateful.

Thank you!

Hey dudes and dudettes! :call_me_hand:
I'm Nathan. I just bought my first complete deck, and now I'm looking to build something of my own. I need more power and range. Ultimately, I want to build two decks :v: One off-road beast that's capable of riding dirt tracks through the bush and one smaller street board with a slight kicktail for ripping it up in the city.
Can't wait to get started on it. I'm brand new to the DIY game, so there's going to be a massive learning curve for me. :books:
Also keen to get to know you guys and hope to meetup for some rides in the future.

Hello everybody! I'm pretty excited to join the community! My friend bought a wowgo board and I fell in love with eboards, so now I'm trying to make my own. I've always been a diy kind of person, and have a lot of experience in similar kinds of projects.

I'm trying to make a particularly fast board, 35mph+, and haven't settled on much of anything yet. I'm slowly earning the money anyway, so I won't click buy on anything for a while. Any advice from an expert would be highly welcome! :)

I'm Andrew! Im from CA, USA. It was my birthday a few days ago and I pulled the trigger to treat myself to buy myself a meepo 1.5 30" !! upon receiving it, it seemed to me that I would prefer a longer deck instead. I recently picked up a used loaded vanguard flex 2 board for ONLY $25 bucks on offerup! 
Planning to do a simple deck swap with it something not too crazy!
Still a novice at this whole Esk8 building thing, but Im sure i can get a hang of it!

Hey Guys,
I'm Harry. I'm a 16 year old maker, and I've done a number of projects over the years such as building a 3D printer and sending a weather balloon 100,000ft in the air. For the past few years building and flying drones has been my main hobby, but after I rode on an electric longboard for the first time about a year ago, I was hooked. It was one the most euphoric experiences I've ever had. I'm a long time snowboarder so it was incredibly natural for me. I sold all my quadcopter stuff, got a job, and I finally have a couple grand saved up to build a quality ESK8. The build is gonna have Carvon V4 Speeddrive R motors, Enertion FOCBOX escs, a @psychotiller built 12S4P 18650 pack, a Surf-Rodz front truck, and an Arbor Dropcruiser deck. I've been lurking on this forum for about a year, but I never signed up until now lol. I can't wait to have my rocket of a build finished! I also weigh 130lbs so I won't be running out of power anytime soon :smile:. If only those Carvons would be come back in stock!

Hi everyone,
My name is Nick.


I bought my first electric skateboard in may, a secondhanded Evolve bamboo GT with the AT setup.

Have did a mod myself already, I thought the torque on the board was pretty high so I bought a 41.5" board and swapped everything on there.


Right now i'm in occupied with waiting for the parts to build and upgrade my battery pack with Samsung 30Q's 10s 4p and also make it swappable with a bigger enclosure.

I will try to photograph the whole proces and when it's done make a topic how I made it.

If there are any questions about how I want to achieve this just reply to my post or send me a message.
*edit*
(ps sorry if my English is awful)

Hello. My name is Nathaniel or Nate for short. 27 years old.

I purchased a 2x 6374 190kV motors with @marcmt88 complete drive system and TB 218mm trucks from a friend @chris.hunt .

I have commissioned @psychotiller to build and assemble the rest of the parts with the following:

* Red Ember Caldera deck
* 10S6P 30Q battery
* Dual FOCBOX's
* @psychotiller Altar Wedge enclosure
* SixShooter wheels

I surrendered the task to a senior builder because I was afraid to mess up royally and waste my money.
I'm sure there is a negative stigma to those that do not build their own boards, so I plan on building a cheaper short deck cruiser that matches or exceeds a Boosted Mini S later in the future.

I am an X-ray Technologist, so if anyone of you take a fall and visit a hospital, I'll be there to take a picture of your internal damages!

I hope to befriend all of you and maybe meet up for some rides here in southern California!

Hello guys,
As many others I am planning to build my own board. For the longest time I have been walking 5 miles a day to work/home and I am sick of it.
One of my problems right now is choosing the right deck for the job (I have read the post about decks :D and it is really useful but doesn't tell me what I need to know) the reason why is I want to use the board to commute during week days and on weekends I want to change the wheels for some 8'' MTB All terrain wheels and use the board for off roading and I don't know what to choose because I don't have the experience you guys have.
I almost pulled the trigger on a Loaded Vanguard board, but I dont know if it is going to be a good choice for off road. Or should I go the other way around and use a mountainboard deck? Like a Trampa 35 or something?
My background is IT/Electronic Engineering so if you need help on that front please let me know.

Best Regards
Nesquick90

Hello Esk8.builders!

I'm a semi-new lurker to this forum, with grandiose plans of building my first esk8 as DIY as possible. A little background on me. I'm a 33 year old engineer; I grew up skateboarding but eventually transitioned to wakeboarding and snowboarding, with a few long boards in the quiver for the off season. I'm fairly familiar to the DIY / maker scene (arduino, Pi, chinese clone boxes and other SOCs), RC (FPV/LOS multirotors and quadcopters) as well as well educated on lipo and li-ion tech (I got obsessed with vapes and quads for a while, :smirk:). I'm decently handy and have rebuilt and modified a number of cars and jeeps, performed full home renovations, and I know my way around a computer build and diagnosing electronics. Being involved in so many hobbies and passions over the years, I've amassed a workshop full of tools to help me along my journey. Recently snagged the malectrics spot welder in prep to build a battery for an esk8 as well as a diy powerwall for my home. 

I've read through all the new member posts and wiki's for a while now and I'm in process of amassing a parts and tools list to begin my build. My current brainstorm plan is to build a esk8 for general cruising nothing spectacular. I'd like for the board to be able to hit 25mph  and have a range of 10+ miles. my only requirements right now are a board with a kicktail that I can cruise but has decent response and I can dodge potholes and other road inadequacies with. I'm about 5'9" and weigh in around 160, I like a more turn-y ride and enjoy the tight turning of a sidewinder / spring loaded truck. Not a ton of huge or steep hills around the area, but would like the board to be able to climb if necessary. Please feel free to add any input that you may find helpful.

Stuff I have already:
Deck: Earthwing Team 37 (i've actually got a ton of EW boards, namely the supercharger, superglider and miniglider, but those boards are too sweet of rides to turn into a heavy esk8 imho) 
Trucks: 10" Caliber II 50 with Riptide wfb pivot cups, 87A krank cannons BS and 87A krank cones RS. Looking to pick up a 44 deg caliber baseplate for the rear 
Mounts: Have a set of marcmt88 complete drivetrains otw 
Pulleys: 14T motor / 36T wheel for 12mm belts from marcmt88 set
Risers: Riptide esk8 risers
Wheels: Abec11 Flywheels in 90mm with Zealous Bearings

Stuff I'm planning on
Motors: dual 6354 208KV sensored BKB / Jlabs motors
ESC: Dual FOCboxes or dual FSESC6.6's (waiting on more feedback on the Flipskys, but I wann run FOC)
Battery: 10S3P - 30Q 18650s
BMS: Besttech BMS? more reading necessary
Remote/Receiver/BT Module: Looking for suggestions in this area. havent gone down the rabbit hole far enough yet. I have some HM10s sitting around in a drawer, but metr seems cool.
Charger: will the xiaomi 42V scooter charger work in this application? (i guess it depends on BMS, again more reading is needed)
Enclosure: Still need more pieces before determining what enclosure I need
LEDS: I have a few strips of APA102c and WS2812Bs and some arduinos and WemosD1s around, or even an old F3 flight controller, might try to make a LED controller to stash in the enclosure that I can control / have the accelerator detect moment to change colors (silly, i know)

Pic of boards for attention!

Hey bro, I imagine you probs already figured this out, but you should be able to make that work. I would recommend buying a higher quality Vesc like Focbox, or even consider a Vesc6 or derivative thereof. 13s of Li Ion is not many volts less than your 16S setup. Think of motors in terms of watts. Watts being volts x amps. Say you have a 2000W motor, with your battery config you'd not want to apply more than 34 Amps to the motor (2000/58.5). There's also the Erpm to consider, most Vesc 4.12 controllers don't like anything higher than 60 00 RPM. The Vesc 6  and other controllers based on that design can take higher RPM. 
I'm curious, what do you do that you have access to these packs? And are you able to procure more for sale?? Hope that info helps.

Hey guys, Panta here. An expat in China. I bought a cheap Chinese mountain board. It is fun but not durable in any way. I am hoping to upgrade to something much better. When the forum allows me to make a thread I want to search for a builder that can build a trampa/e-toxx direct drive monster of a machine. Unless someone can point me in a better direction then a tramp/e-toxx build. I want an all around monster. It will need to tackle some pretty rough terrain!

Hi everyone,

My name is Mike, I'm from New Zealand and I'm keen to get some advice from experienced electric skateboard builders.

Specifically I'm looking to squeeze a bit more speed out of my current setup.
I have a mixture of cheapish parts from China that I'm reasonably happy with but I max out at 27 kmh (according to strava). I am currently running 6s lipos connected to one of these speed controllers:
https://www.ebay.com/itm/single-motor-electric-longboard-skateboard-controller-ESC-Substitute/302546263597 and my motor is a "Brushless Outrunner Motor N5065 270KV 1665W".

My question is, will upgrading my batteries from 6s lipo to 10s lipo give me any more speed or will my motor be the bottle neck here?

I will also be upgrading my wheels and motor pulley but I'm most interested in the battery question.

Thanks
```

Hi @miker,
I think your bottleneck will be your ESC. Those ESCs have a motor rev limit of ... 6000RPM (someone correct me if I misremember).
Put your set up into http://calc.esk8.it/ to see what you're at already.

If you're at the motor RPM limit then you can gear differently to get better top speed.
If you're not at the motor RPM you can add batteries until you reach it!

Hi @MonkeyM,

Thanks for that yes it looks like I'm pretty close to the 6000RPM limit so I think I'll look at bigger wheels and motor pulley. 

Then I guess my next question to the community will be about gearing ratios. My current setup is using a 16 to 48 tooth pulley setup (https://www.aliexpress.com/item/New-Arrival-DIY-Electric-Skateboard-Kit-Parts-Pulleys-And-Motor-Mount-For-80MM-Wheels/32831003910.html)

And I am actually only running 70mm wheels.

Thanks

Mike

Hi, I would like to build an electric skateboard for the Summer.

Current things I have purchased:
Calliber ii trucks https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00SIMA27I/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1
Enkeo longboard deck
Fake 83mm Abec11 wheel (slick revolutions) https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B01J835996/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1

I would like to purchase the rest:
Hobbyking sk8 motor, 6364,190kv
2*4500mah 6s to configure for 12s set up
generic 2.4Ghz remote from aliexpress
Hobby king sk8 motor mount + enclosure
____________________________________
The kit can be seen on this website
https://kit.com/hughkanerules/electric-skateboard
___________________________________

The problem with this kit is that the pulley set from hobby king is currerntly on backorder. I would like to buy from people on this site, but I am currently in Japan, so the international delivery is quite expensive :'(

I was wondering if the ones below would work well.
https://www.aliexpress.com/item/Pulleys-and-Motor-Mount-Parts-DIY-For-83MM-90MM-97MM-Wheels-Electric-Skateboard-Kit/32859804341.html?spm=2114.10010108.1000013.2.6caa4ef5m8B2No&scm=1007.13339.99728.0&scm_id=1007.13339.99728.0&scm-url=1007.13339.99728.0&pvid=6b966b5b-9c82-452e-93cf-e158465993c1&_t=pvid:6b966b5b-9c82-452e-93cf-e158465993c1,scm-url:1007.13339.99728.0

I am also unsure about my battery set up, please comment :slight_smile:

For a 12s setup you would need a 12s because you are going to wire the two 6s in series. So a 12s [BMS](https://www.aliexpress.com/store/product/12S-60A-50-4V-li-ion-BMS-PCM-battery-protection-board-bms-pcm-for-electric-bike/1821822_32847001643.html?spm=2114.search0104.3.22.2b3a11feJO19a3&ws_ab_test=searchweb0_0,searchweb201602_1_10152_10151_10065_10344_10130_10068_10547_10342_10343_10340_10548_10341_10696_10084_10083_10618_10139_10307_10059_100031_10103_10624_10623_10622_10621_10620,searchweb201603_2,ppcSwitch_5&algo_expid=ce688d6b-7759-4ecf-9eb8-6e21cb6f9e12-3&algo_pvid=ce688d6b-7759-4ecf-9eb8-6e21cb6f9e12&priceBeautifyAB=0) that can deliver around 60 amps of discharge I think would be suitable. you wire them in by using the balance leads from the battery carefully following the diagrams provided from the manufacture of the bms. I would get a voltmeter to check which is cell one, two, three by looking at the voltage increases.

Also I noticed you did not included which VESC you would be using, which is something to consider.

Hey guys just looking for some help getting my parts list together.

I am looking at making a longboard with SixShooter Pneumatic wheels from psychotiller.

I am looking for some suitable trucks and motor mounts i am looking at the caliber II trucks found [here](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00NY3Q5Q8/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&th=1&psc=1)

I am just worried about size and I can't seem to find the axle diameter.

Any suggestions on this?

The pic in my profile pic is a db longboard freeride dt deck with the Evolve supercarve trucks and AT Kit. I just received my 2 focboxes today and only miss a few screws and an enclosure gasket to start the build. I like fast boards and after reading a few posts it seems  the evolve supercarve trucks might not be the best option for speed (speed whobbles at moderate speed (30-35kmh)) . I'll be able to tell you more once i've finished my build in about a week (dual aps 6355, 190KV, 15t/66t , 10s5p).

Ill still be lurkin for a bit. But im slowly piecing together a fishboard that will have some duel belts or direct drives, if i can snag some carvon td's, and ill prob be buildng my own battery.   

Anyways. Im in the sf bay area when i get my board up and runnin its gonna be my traffic killer. I need 4 miles to the ferry, 4 miles to my job in hilly san fran, and back. Tryin not to drive 30 miles in traffic each day.Im looking for a sweet spot of around 25 miles or so cuz my fat @ss aint gonna give this board no mercy. 

 Nice to finally intro. See ya round the boards..

Hello my name is Mark "mars" my initials.
Born in Brisbane almost  60 believe it no, act it no, look it ........two out of three.

 Background mechanic .... IT networking .....always trained something,  gym 25 years.
 I've modified every car, computer, skateboard  I've ever owned.
Always respected originality but never fast, powerful or shiny enough.

After 12 months trolling the net  I pulled the trigger on a eBay Evolve GTX Street and AT. 
 4 weeks later another  2,  $1000  Aus each 300 cycles and 3 cycles..... .
 I think I've got the eSk8 bug hahaha

This is a awesome site with a 1000 life times of knowledge up for grabs.
To whom it may concern many thanks.

Working on my first build ....looking for stability at higher speed.
Not necessarily looking to ride at those speeds.
Carving on the GTX is awesome but over 35 Km becomes uncomfortable.... lol
So far ordered:
 @psychotiller ...six shooters
 @hummie ...Round three wood and carbon deck group buy
@psychotiller SR 200mm RKP trucks with quick66 mounts
Psycho's arc Enclosure with wire channel
Dual 6369 sensored 200kv Maytech motors

While you're at it, you should grab @psychotiller 's enclosure for that hummie deck! Hell while your at from psycho:

- TKPs or RKPs with mounts (rkps more stable, tkps more carvey)

-hummie deck enclosure by psycho

- Psychotiller power plant 6369 motors

- 10s?p (whatever firs the hummie deck) made by psychotiller, unless you want to get into battery making.... its a fucking blast! Figuratively and unfortunately literally if you aren't careful.

Then take pleasure in the fact that you will have a better first build than 99% of people! 

Your timing on the 6 shooters is impeccable! People have been waiting for a minute for these. Some of the best there is!

Hello @Sender thanks for the heads up. 

TKPs or RKPs with mounts....I'll have to look that up.

6369 motors also..... I was looking for torque ….maybe 6380 170KV Torque Boards hahahah

I'm am sure @psychotiller 6369 would be plenty lol

Definitely plenty. Will blow that GTX out of the water.  Just because things are availavle, doesn't mean that what fits the bill of what you need or are looking for. 

Either way, get that enclosure for sure. Tailor made for that deck.

And for sure get a set of trucks and mounts from him.  They are the best.  You will be using CNC precision trucks from Surf Rodz instead of cast calibers like so many.

You already have two amazing components, don't let this bad ass set up down by going mid grade trucks.  Get that fire!

If you want some more torque, he should have some 6374s back in at some point. But the most important os getting those trucks amd mounts.  Based off what you described wanting, I would lean towards the RKPs. I promise you won't regret it.

Yes I agree....looking for torque but not massive battery drain.

I'll definitely be asking him about the trucks and mounts.

What about solder less battery packs? N.E.S.E or similar.

They are cool... but eat up a lot of valuable space.  I would lean towards a custom battery build. Psychotiller already has a hummie deck on hand.  Would be tailor freggin made. I would definitely buy a pack from him if I was looking to purchase.

Depending on the cinfiguration, you will have to alter the deck....

Hey everyone. I just joined today. I ordered a Raptor 2 last year in June. My board finally shipped June 12th, but I was one of their lucky customers that got their board held up in customs ever since. We are reaching into 2 months of delay in shipping, and I'm getting impatient, so I decided to keep myself busy by DIY'ing my own board.

I have been looking through the builders community, and I'm in the process of collecting my own parts list. I am planning to create a dedicated topic once I decided what parts I want to buy, but if anyone is interested, here's my document (switch builds by navigating the bottom tabs): https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aU_aK4pkEx1lfPRn9ebJj5gv-uOVlatI-sew1OXCelY/edit?usp=sharing - Feel free to come with input! :smiley: 

P.S.: How do I create my own topic? I assume it's because my account is new...

Hi all. I'm from Perth, Australia. I have been here for a couple of weeks, finished building my first board on the weekend with some online help of a few members on here. The community here is very welcoming and extremely helpful. My board is only a used as a commuter. Using an AWOL longboard deck with some chinese 90mm dual hub motors topped off with a chinese dual hub motor esc running on 6s 5000mah lipo.

![my%20esk8|281x500](upload://uXaJ7QSNShiZDyiSiodrqZBx12L.jpg)![my%20esk8-2|281x500](upload://j5H64wMccEaKJDaw0yKjPKC405.jpg)!
![my%20esk8-3|281x500](upload://zTa6kMEKAsmvI33wF4XMqbpeT2a.jpg)

So far I've taken it on about two 8km round trips and came back with 11.4v left in each pack both trips from fully charged at 12.5v. The ride was up small inclines and only at cruising speed (I haven't been on a board in 15 years). When I get my mobile phone back from repairs I'll be able to do more accurate range tests. So far I have only mapped out a route on google maps to my local grocery store which is just under 2km one way. I'm pretty pleased with my board considering it was cheaper to build and including to buy a lipo battery charger than any other chinese pre-built board. Plus I have the original trucks, wheels and bearings that came with the longboard which are better than the chinese set the hub motors came with but the chinese ones are still good, just a little squeaky.

Hi, i have been lurking for quite some time, and finally decided to bite the bullet and buy myself a wowgo 2s.

a little about me, i am 41 year old, and come from Leeds (UK), i couldn't quite decide how my mid life crisis should proceed, and as i cannot afford a sports car or a 21 year old girlfriend, i opted for a wowgo instead, to be honest i have been toying with building a board for quite some time, but as the wowgo was cheaper than the outlay for a decent diy set up, i figured i would go this route first, and if i enjoy the hobby, then i might go bigger and better when i do decide to diy build.

i havent had all that much chance to get out on it yet, i blame work but really i need to give myself a kick up the backside and just get out, any how here's a pic, i bought a Triple 8 dual certified, but much prefer the full face security from my sixsixone rage, also sport some TGS knee and elbow protection, along with some TSG wrist guards.

Hey guys! I'm a 100m sprinter and economics student from the Sunshine Coast in Australia, looking to build an eboard for my commute to uni (about 20km range total) and just as a fun project with a couple of my mates.
So far I'm looking at:
DIY 6355 190kv motor
DIY single motor mount kit
DIY ESC
Enertion remote (thought I'd go with the most expensive option since I really don't want it cutting out while I'm riding haha)
And beyond that I'm not quite sure what battery to go with, although I've been leaning towards li-ion just not sure which one.

My name is Arjan

I'm a fairly new rider from the Netherlands.
I built my first board last year and am now looking to upgrade it since it is broken now.

The main reason I signed up here is so I could order a motor mount from marcmt88 but since I am a new member and can't send PM's yet, I might aswell introduce myself.

I am more interested in the technical aspect of building an electric longboard than I am a rider.
In fact, last year was the first time I ever stood on a longboard or skateboard for that matter.

I own 3 3D printers and have a 40W laser cutter. Workiing with those machines is my main hobby that connects all my other hobbies together; Quadcopters, Driving and working on my car, working on my longboard and more.

If you have questions, please feel free to ask. I have a question for anybody; when can I send PM's?

Thats it, bye!

Hi @Samuel...every question you could possible have has a answer here.
Keep reading.... navigating the site will get easier.

Read the rules gain you badges increase you accreditations.

Safety is paramount buy good safety gear. 
Even with your speed it's faster than you can run.

It's generally more expensive to DIY ….exchange rates freight etc. 
But what you get has your input and can exceed performance wise.
In Aus you money will go further. A company board made here will be cheaper.
Everyone has a budget...The old adage holds true you get what you pay for.

The esk8 community people won't rip you off. They excel in sharing there knowledge.

Look at other builds learn....no one board has it all. Figure out what you need to do to determine your design components. Search in builds for similar to what you are thinking of. Ask questions, send emails, read through the sight, reply to posts chances are your question are already answered somewhere. Try to find them.    


Parts my first build:
So far ordered:
@psychotiller …six shooters
@hummie …Round three wood and carbon deck group buy
@psychotiller SR 200mm RKP trucks with quick66 mounts
Psycho’s arc Enclosure with wire channel
Dual 6369 sensored 200kv Maytech motors

One is based on an old trampa with MTVESC100A (just fried 3 of them :confused:)  belt transmission, one on an old RKB with chain drive and FS VESC 6, the late one is a Trampa with mini E-Toxx direct drive and ESCape.

Not sure if anyone touched on this with you but that enertion remote isn't the best, don't let the price fool you mate. A mini rc remote will not let you down, simple, doesn't drop connection and works every time. You can buy 3 spares for the money too 😊

Hi everyone,

I'm a controls engineer student from Holland and planning on building my own OneWheel with the use of this informative forum! After having done a lot of reading I have come to the following (incomplete) build:

- FLIPSKY FSESC 6.6 based upon VESC® 6 + Heat Sink (group buy @moon)

- 600 Watt 10x6-5.5 inch Hub motor \w hall sensors. The motor is available in different voltages( 24V, 36V, 48V and 60V). From what I understand, a higher voltage is preferable given that the VESC and battery can handle it (less current=less heat). I am in doubt about which to take, the 36V or 48V... Any suggestions? A link to the motor is shown below:

https://nl.aliexpress.com/item/10inch-10-inch-10x6-00-5-5-wide-tyre-brushless-gearless-dc-wheel-hub-motor-balance/32823573279.html?isOrigTitle=true

- Li-ion battery. Depending on the motor (36V or 48V) a 10s4p/10s2p or 12s2p setup. Not sure what would be preferable...

I find it hard to estimate whether i will have enough torque with the selected motor. Anyone an idea? Advice is greatly appreciated :)!

Hi guys, thanks for letting me join. Complete nobb with all the skateboarding stuff. Looking to build a board. Been a long time 'Adventurist' Windsurfing/biking/ski-ing/quadcopter freestyle/racing/R/C Helicopter 3D etc etc. Generally if it moves or moves me, I'm interested. 

Looking to build a longboard, poss a tall order. Requirements Easy to ride (beginner but learn quick) 
15mls Round trip, capable of 800' climb and return downhill. Max grade around 12% Roughish road surface. Otherwise gentle carving on smooth surface for fun.

Would like it to be quiet so poss hub motors. AUW with Pilot and Kit around 75kg. Approx initial budget around £500

Thanks again,  going to have a good read on the forum see whats possible, maybe carry a 2nd battery if above is over optimistic

Hi everyone! I've longboarded for awhile but this will be my first electric longboard build. I'll be using it to get to and around campus. Around here there are a lot of hills since Utah State University is right next to the mountains. I will need a lot of torque to get my 200lb self up the long steep hills around here. My current plan is to do a 10s dual 6355 setup on a Loaded Poke board. Probably looking to do 97mm wheels as well. I'll probably be asking a lot of questions since this is my first build! Hopefully it all goes well!

Hahaha yeah it's about right. They are properly powerful motors. Barely getting warm after 20min 15% incline. I don't carry my  board I ride it. 
They might do a less powerful motor which will be lighter.
Hover board motors are a lot lighter. But have no grunt.

That would be 28lbs just hub motors alone, more than most complete boards. Your board must be about 50lbs total. Good to hear performance is there might still get them for something like a go kart application.

Hi,

My name is Oren, from Israel. Never rode a skateboard! :persevere: But my Son, 9 yo, does, and since he asked to "do a project" with me, I suggested that we'll create a motorized skateboard.

Then I discovered this crazy world of esk8s through youtube and websites. :thinking:

Then I saw how expensive a setup can get, and almost gave up. :hushed:

Then I found this active, knowledgeable, and friendly forum, and decided that with your help we'll do it. :sunglasses:

Hi all - Dave here. I’ve been using this board for research for the last few months. Thought I should introduce myself.

Current/first esk8 is an Evolve GTX. I’ve had it for around two months now, and I’m really pleased with it. 

I was tossing up between the GTX and a boosted mini. I think I have much preferred the dimensions of the mini... but as I live in New Zealand, the shipping cost and lack of after sales care pushed me from Boosted towards Evolve.

So I’ve kinda set out to build something loosely based on a boosted mini... here’s what I have or have ordered:

Deck - Carver Proteus
Trucks - Caliber II 50s
Wheels - Orangatang Caguamas
ESC - FOCBOX unity
Mount - UNIK core series dual motor mount
Battery - gradually buying 30q batteries... I have 9 atm
BMS - ordered a 60A 10s BMS from aliexpress:
https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/fUZR3hR
Belts - 15mm HTD245
Motor pulleys - Aluminium 15t (might switch for steel gates/evolve)
Wheel pulleys - evolve kegel 32t... thinking of switching for bkb modular pulleys.

Extras - UNIK risers, bones reds, battery meter, charge port

Stuff to be confirmed/built 
Battery - had planned 10s3p but I’m contemplating 4p... I think I can fit it in.
Motors - was planning on two Flipsky 6354s, but there are some recent bad reviews which are making me wary
Enclosure - I have made a foam mold for a carbon fibre enclosure, and I’ll probably add a layer of carbon fibre to the bottom of the deck while I’m at it
Remote - I have ordered all the intervals for a firefly remote, just need the 3d printed parts

Hey I am pretty new to the diyesk8 community and want to build a loaded vanguard 12s hub motor setup. I already preordered a Focbox unity and I know I want some hummie hubs v4 because I like near the sf area and they have great preformance. I just dont know what to do battery wise. I was thinking about the Miami Electric 12s3p but it is large and would be tough to put on a vanguard. I want a 12s3p battery for future proofing but I  might just have to go with a 12s2p battery.  Oh and I need some ideas for a remote, I like the thumb ones.Thanks for reading.

hi and welcome!
If you like the thumb ones, look for firefly here in the forum.
you can build it by your own or ask somebody like @rey8801.
I think he make them and sell them to a good price too.
If you need a proper enclosure for the vanguard then check out the enclosures
from @Eboosted

if I´m not wrong, you will fit there even 12s4p inside.

Hello.  I'm freaking out.  I just ordered my first electric skateboard, without ever experiencing one - only vicariously through youtube videos.  I can't believe I waited this long to jump into this new thing.  I used to ride regular skateboards, but I've been living in a (man)cave for many years.  

I have a question:  Do you get exercise?  I'm thinking you do, but not sure.  I mean, does it still give you a workout, like cardio or burning calories?

The thought of being effortlessly propelled up a hill on my skateboard seems like heaven to me.  Gliding against a headwind, at a reasonable speed, silently, like a ghost.  I can't wait.  

I don't know how long it'll take for me to crave more power, but just the thought of going more than 13-mph seems crazy to me.  I have a feeling my "underpowered/budget" board will be more than adequate for my style of mellow cruising.  I opted for the Sanyo 8.5 Ah pack for the least range-anxiety.  

I'm pretty sure you won't be able to keep me off this thing once it gets here.  If the sun is out, I'll be rolling in the wind.  I'll ride it 'till it's dead, then sleep only for how long it needs to recharge, then ride all night long.  I'll ride downtown and explore the city.  I'll venture down alleyways and take bike paths through parks along rivers.  I'll cross bridges when I come to them.  I've never had brakes on a skateboard before, so I'm going to feel so safe on scary downhill sections.

I'm 43 years old.  I fell in love with (regular) skateboards in 1986, when I was 11 years old.  I haven't matured much at all since then.  I'm out of shape, but not fat.  5'-11" tall, 185 lbs.  Ordered the WowGo 2s K.T. the other day with replaceable P.U. motors.  I live in a hilly area where skateboards are illegal to be used on roads.  I'm really hoping this works out for me the way I'm envisioning it.  Stoked is an understatement.

Hi, I'm no expert but I have a 30 inch belt drive atom electric B10 which is a really great board but I would have gone with the Wowgo 2s looking back. You'll love it, I thought in the beginning I would never go over 15 mph but here I am building a balls to the wall 35 mph 20 mile range just 8 months later. You don't really burn calories unless you are constantly carving or carving a little but that limits range. You should be fine with the Sanyo. For the hills in your area try to build up speed before you start climbing them to save the battery. Other than that I think you will love it and will be going 20+ in no time.

Hey there @RatchetRoller as @dougpage says "You don’t really burn calories unless you are constantly carving that's demanding on your battery....for me that's is the most fun. Keeping your core switched on is exercise...getting up and out of the house moving around it all adds up to burn cals.

If you haven't already... all about battery's

"I’ve never had brakes on a skateboard before, so I’m going to feel so safe on scary downhill sections."
Make sure you have a plan if you have a disconnect …no power no brakes.

Safety first...type in protective gear .. in the search box and have a read.
Safety should be your first priority and then offcourse having fun...lol

I'm a new member!  I recently got to ride an Evolve Carbon GT with AT wheels, and now want to get my own board.  Debating about building one, versus buying an Evolve.  For me, I'm looking for something that I can  commute on without having to worry about recharging at work.  The round trip from work is around 22km.  I also want to be able to go out on the weekends with a bunch of guys that I know that have boards - boosted and evolve.   

So far, I'm thinking of the trampa urban carver with single or twin motors, or a trampa with the big monster box for ridiculous range.  From what I have read so far, using bindings on a commuting board is not a wise idea, so the big battery option might get in the way.  Learning heaps from this forum!

Good afternoon

I'm Rush, and I've owned a few boards.  My first board was an Elecktroskate I got ten years ago.  I also have an Evolve Bamboo.  I like the Kali-Nyc boards, and since they don't seem to be available, I decided to try and build one.  Never done this before but I have made RC cars. I'm nervous, and this is overwhelming, but I'm jumping in.  

First question.  Is there a page that has Kali Board instructions?  Where do people usually start?  

Money is not a problem.  

I look forward to chatting with you all.

Hello members of eSk8

Total newbie here on e-skateboard. I was a backer for ionboard X on kickstarter last year. After waited for many months the board finally arrived. 

On the day itself I tried to charge it but as soon as I was going to plug in the charging head to the board port, there were some sparks ignited followed by burning smell. (I haven't even turn on the wall socket power and the board was not powered on)  

Luckily the board can still be turned on but unfortunately the power adapter got fried. A week later I tried to charge again using a new power adapter and same thing happened. Wasted two power adapter. 

So right now I have an almost battery depleted board and not able to charge it. I suspect that the problem might be the wiring or battery. Has anyone experienced this and how do I solve this problem?

Last but not least, hobbyking is always a good site for all small electronics. They also have the sk3 motors which seems to be one of the most reliable motors out there,but unsensored. Sk8 motors are sensored. 

That’s basically all you need for your kaly style build

Did you opened up your enclosure?
Make some pictures and upload it here.
You said it’s sparking only by plug in the charge plug, even if the charge plug is not powered?

Hi Andy87

I think I might know how to open up the deck but that might spoil the grip tape. I would need to peel the grip tape to get to the screws. The main issue is what if I manage to open it up and I've no idea how this whole thing work? 

Yeah, I didn't even turn on the wall power socket. Could it be that the cable polar is wrong?  Just a thought.

Make some pictures how it looks now and upload it.
If you have a multimeter check the polarity on your charge plug and compair it with the Charger Plug polarity. 
If it’s a laptop brick style charger port take care that you don’t accidentally short the plug while measuring 😉

Ive just joined with the hope (and intention) of one day building a nice board. Right now im limited by budget, but been looking at creating a parts list of a nice MTB. ALthough, ive been torn, as im soon off to uni, and although a MTB would be great here (where i currently live, there are poorly paved roads and many many hills/paths) as a daily, i think it may be less ideal in a uni / city setting, so thinking of perhaps trying to find a good medium (as in how Evolve has done soe design-wise). 
The problem is choosing parts. Whats the best option for me? What my heart says or what my wallet says ;) 
Gonna continue saving to allocate funds to this, but i cant wait to be riding. I just hope its soon.

Unfortunately I don't have multimeter to check it's polarity. I would need to find an electrician. 
Below the deck there's a small compartment which have access to the ESC I guess. As for the battery I can't see it as its located deep inside the casing. I will upload the photos later.

I think I might have solved the problem! The board port cable that connect the battery was joint wrongly. I saw the red was aligned with the black cable and I unhooked, reversed and joint it back and now it seems to be charging![IMG_20181007_140018|666x500](upload://cNPFH7b7yiquCtLvJVaM4vNy8QT.jpeg) 
If you look at the photo, the bottom red cable was joint with black cable. How did I missed this all along?!  Damn! 
Huge relieve that I manage to solve this issue partly because I highlighted it in this forum and with some assistance from you Andy87. Thank you!

Hi, I am new to this forum. I have more e-boards at home but mainly riding on Evolve CGT. I have upgraded battery (10s5p Sony VT6 from Kevin Dark aka "the battery guy"). However I am thinking how to improve my range with my AT tires (currently have 25km on good roads on fast mode).

I wonder how to DIY build an external box (with a secondary LiPo battery) to power up my CGT through the charging port. I am not very experienced in electrotechnics, but I guess I will need just a LiPo battery, some step-up converter (link: https://www.aliexpress.com/item/600W-Digital-Control-DC-DC-Adjustable-Step-Up-Module-Constant-Voltage-Current-Solar-Charging-Module-Board/32847200866.html?spm=a2g0s.8937460.0.0.3b4e2e0ec1mJDl ) and the correct connectors and casing?

I can´t find a topic on this problem here and I don´t know how to create a thread on this topic (maybe I am not able to do it as new user). Could you help me out?

Hey everyone, my name is Nish!

I got into esk8s because I needed to cure my fix for snowboarding during the summer months.

Started off with riding the Boosted Board and I ride the Leiftech.

The nature of the Leiftech got me thinking about building my own e-skate (or modifying my Leiftech). I figured I'd join here to get a feel for what everyone has done :slight_smile:

I also started working on a smart safety lighting company, [Intentful Motion](https://intentfulmotion.com), after I got hit by a taxi on my Boosted. You can use gestures for indicators and it automatically flashes stop and accel lights as you move about. The idea is you can throw it on pretty much any board, bicycle, backpack, or whatever to get awareness on the roads.

Hi. My name is Oliver. I'm 37 years old and live in Germany. I'm into esk8 since a time but got my first board 1 year ago. Before I did unpowered Longboarding but I'm old (or lazy) and dont want to push anymore. Watched many videos of electric boards and it seemed to be the perfect way to get around. ... Searched the Internet where to get an esk8 or where to get parts from to build a DIY. ... The options where restricted if you want something from Europe because of customs. It took a few month/years until I did it.

I own a Dual Beast from eskating.eu. Very nice board with a lot of power. One of the first things I did was limiting it to about 30 kmh (20 mph) because going near 50 kmh (30-35 mph) was too scary for me.

OK, this year was the best of my life :) Its so much fun, I want to ride all the time! Unfortunately since 2 days I have a problem after updating my focbox to the latest firmware. I will describe it in another thread because it's OT here. Maybe I will also find out how to create a topic. I cant find a button for this(?)

Thanks for reading.

I found an answer to my own question, but I thought I might post it anyway just in case anyone else needed the guidance.  

For a hub motor board -= you cannot use the Sidewinder Trucks as they will not fit the rear hubs.  The koowheel ones are squared, not round hangers, so they notch into the wheels.  Hope that helps someone.  I didn't find that out till I took my board to the Local Skate shop & took it all apart in hopes to purchase a full set of Sidewinder Trucks there. :sleepy:

Reading and watching people builds, and seeing projects that started and got developed here because of esk8 (VESC, DieBieBMS, Firefly, Proton..) is absolutely amazing.

I'm a EE student from Croatia, and eboard is on my TODO list at least a year now, but i never had money to start. I got a job now and can finally afford basic budget board build. Will be posting my planned build soon, to hear your comments and criticism.

I'm pretty new here and after some research have decided to convert my loaded tesseract to an e-board. The build I'm thinking about is dual 190w 6355 motors from tourqeboards on caliber trucks (front is 50° back has a Randal 35° baseplate) with a focbox unity and 12s5p Samsung 30q battery. For the deck I have some lamenting experience and am looking at modifying it similar to how @whitepony did his carbon fiber tesseract. My biggest issue right now is using larger wheels (Orangatang Caguamas 85mm) are giving me some mad wheelbite despite an inch of riser and having cut out some wheelwells, I probably just need stiffer bushings though.

if no, than just start your own thread.
write down what you want to creat.
which parts you choose and ask if things will fit together.
i´m sure you will get it done easily.
it´s not a big deal to do a your own trampa build if you know which parts from where to buy.
if it will take too long or @kaly is too busy at the moment, you could always get a gear drive or other stuff from him for your own build.
if you need some help just ask here (and add me ;) (

Hi all, 
I'm looking to build myself a sweet Boosted clone as I loved the ride on it when I tested it.
My first board was a wowgo bought during the sprint and I loved the first experience on this. My test ride on a boosted was on another level though.
I'm scared as f to start building a board but really want my custom made board.
I have very little tools and am not much of a builder (took me 1,5h to build a shelf T_T).
I'd like this new beast to cost me ~900€.
Parts I selected:
* Vanguard Flex 3 or 4 (I'm light)
* Caliber II Red
* Orangatan 85mm or 97 FlyWheel
* 1/4 Risers

* Motors: 2x DIY 6355 190kV
* Mounts: 2x DIY Motor mount
* ESCs: 2x DIY TORQUE ESC
* Battery: My wowgo's Samsung
* Enclosures + On/Off switch: Wowgo's
* Pulleys: DIY 36T Kegel pulley x2
* Remote: DIY's remote + receiver
* Dual ESC Bus connector
* XT90 Parrallel connector
* Male to male servo connector

Cost ~815€
Possible upgrades: 
* Better looking enclosures ~80€
* Sanyo Battery pack ~200€
* Focbox unity ESC ~+100€
* Coach from esk8 builders ~TBD :stuck_out_tongue: 


Not sure if I missed anything. I want this build to be as simple as possible.

Hi all
I'm Corsin, I'm from Switzerland

My first board was the raptor2.0, which I liked performance wise but not so much from the deck and carving

After I had a fall and broke my arm, I decided it's time for a board with real wheels
So I looked into Carvon's direct drives and liked them. But I did some research and found out that they are unpredictable in delivery and not very talkative

Since then I was waiting (half a year at least). Lately I heard of the new Torqueboards direct drive system which then came out to preorder yesterday. And wonder what, instantly bought me a 4WD kit.

Also bought me 2 Foxboc Unity's and a photon remote

Jup, I want to build a monster ^^

Now I just have no clue on how I will connect the Focboxes or if I just take them separate with a receiver per unity and just connect both to the remote - what do you guys think here? kinda not finding valuable information on this

Also have to decide for a decent deck + enclosure
Battery pack, should I go for eg 1x 12s6p for the whole system or separate the front and back with a eg 12s4p
BMS: no clue about, as I want to be able to change batteries a pack with bms would be overhead, but i guess it would be best to have it in the board and not on the charger

Plan is to go backpacking with the board. If it works out, I'd like to travel from Switzerland to somewhere south-east/east asia

And yes, I will buy some heavy protection, just needs more research. Do we have a wiki for this?


I'm happy to be here and hope that I can give back the knowlege that I'll learn!

If one side broke, you still have the other working.

I'm a new user here. I'm planning a Boosted clone. I like the Loaded Vanguard but I want more range than the Boosted. I like what SkateMetric did with the Foosted http://skatemetric.com/index.php/2018/07/03/ultimate-accessible-foosted-build-tutorial/ , but I also want the fit and finish a little better than the Ownboard enclosures. I'm planning on a similar build but using the eBoosted battery and enclosure, and a FocBox unit to simplify the ESC side of things.

Skate hardware - Loaded Vanguard, Caliber II, Orangatang Caguama

Motors - TorqueBoards 6355 motors, motor mounts, and pulleys from https://

**First eSkate build:**

Board from skateshred.com.  Foxbox VESC.  TB 6374 motors and 7s3p battery I made myself with Samsung 25R batteries.  Caliber 2 trucks and flywheel knockoffs.  Enclosure was the most challenging to get one that fit the components, but only as big as necessary.  Still have to add LED lights, but have the controller tested and working.  Just waiting on a LED splitter.  (it's my son's board and LEDs made it that much cooler! :) )

Also making a second board for me with a 10s3p set up and dual focbox/motors, but somehow fried one of my focboxes. Have tested the board and it runs great with the single motor, but need to get a second vesc and finish my enclosure.  

I just created an account on this site, but have spent many hours over the past few months reading your builds and gaining knowledge, so thank you to everyone that has shared your stories and builds. 

Also, here's who I purchased items through:

* Torqueboards - 6374 motors, mounts, 218 trucks for my dual motor set up, 97mm wheels for the dual, 
* Skateshred.com - blank deck
* Hyperion Systems - Most of my electronics
* IMR - Batteries
* BuildKitBoards
* Veruznd - 7s balance charger; 3s balance chargers for LED 12v light packs, heat shrink, nickel
* Malectrics for the arduino-based Li-ion battery welder kit (which was awesome)

Here's a few pictures of the finished one (correction...only one picture since I'm limited on how many pictures I can upload.)

Hello! I'm new to this community. I'm from Argentina and I'm building my first e-skate. 

I'm making a DIY foldable longboard (I've been reading the noob threads here on this site for a while now and I have almost everything ready) built to be reliable and long-lasting. Speed and torque are not priority, battery life and the board not catching fire is :) 

My parts:

Motor: 1x  [turnigy aerodrive sk3 6364 213kv](https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-aerodrive-sk3-6364-213kv-brushless-outrunner-motor.html?___store=en_us) (wondering the difference between that and the SK3 - 6364-190KV besides the difference in kV)

Drivetrain: [16/36 with 5mm belt](https://www.amazon.com/Pulley-Flywheel-Retainer-Electric-Skateboard/dp/B07FCVY4SF/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1543272328&sr=8-3&keywords=electric+skateboard+wheel+pulley&refinements=p_72%3A2661618011) (will the torque be enough to ride a 10°-15° slope? I weight about 175 pounds)  

Battery:  I'm aiming for a 10s4 or 6P made of Samsung's 25R INR 18650 . Here's where I'm stuck. I've read somewhere that batteries in series can't be charged normally (each cell needs to be monitored so that its not overcharged). I'm not sure how to do this, so I'm not sure what I need to charge the board. I'm aiming to use a laptop-type charger (even if the charge time is not the best) but I'm not sure if I need to include a circuit or something else on the board.

ESC is still missing, I'm wondering if it will need a heat sink or anything to handle 80% of the 10s6p.

I'm open to suggestions!

Cheers

For the battery you need a BMS (Battery Management System)
There are charge only and charge/discharge BMS
Most people seem to use only a charge BMS as discharge are pricier (and I also think there aren't many of them)
The BMS will balance your cells, your parallel groups to be exactly, so that they all stay on the same voltage, so you wont overcharge (unlikely if right charger is used) or undercharge one of your parallel group causing damage to it

<del>It can be either in your charger</del> you want to load with a laptopstyle charger, so you need to have it in your board or battery pack, depends on the battery pack you gonna buy

For the ESC, as you want a 1WD, I'd go with a Focbox as long as they are sold, they seem to be popular and reliable. Else I don't know, as I'm also highly new into DIY and am still learning myself

As long as you go with a 10S Battery (Lower should also be possible but not quite sure how that thing works) it should work, atm I don't know myself how/what I will do there - but that's why we have this forum :slight_smile: 
10S will be good for your build, maybe you can even go lower - motor description says it wants 10S, so it'll be probably the best -, depends on how powerfull your board should be

I see it's a charge/discharge bms, nice -> will be safer (even though I'm not sure if you want your board to catch fire or not ;P )
40A max discharge should be ok -> can someone confirm this?

-> looks good to me, but rather ask someone with more knowledge, to be sure it'll work

I bought a similar BMS to that Vruzend one for my son's board and for my 10s battery, I purchased a different one from buildkitboards.  I personally like the smaller one from BKB.  The Vruzend one is a charge and discharge BMS and is a bit larger.  As the Vruzend BMS couldn't handle the amps that my skateboard was going to need, I ended up bypassing the discharge.  The BKB BMS is charge only, so thinner, and am very happy with it.

Hi!
I'm completely new to skateboarding and esk8:ing. I'm an engineer and work with software development in Stockholm/Sweden and I like to tinker with IoT-stuff like Raspberry Pi's and Arduinos. Building an Esk8 seems like a really fun project and this excellent forum got me hooked. 
My idea is to build an esk8 together with my 8-year old son (maybe the other two (11 and 13 years old) will join as well). The idea is mainly to have fun building it, but of course it will be really nice if it works as well :wink:

Since none of has skated before our goals are probably a bit different from the average esk8er:
1. To have fun building it
2. To learn stuff about electronics, mechanics and batteries on the go
3. To build something reasonably safe 
4. To build something stable and easy to ride
5. To find good budget alternatives, I'm thinking of a total budget around 300-400€. Buying used components is totally OK.

Speed, range and durability will be unimportant to start with.

I started out by watching this tutorial:
[BigKids - HOW TO BUILD A DIY ELECTRIC ⚡ SKATEBOARD TUTORIAL PART 1 - BETTER THAN A BOOSTED BOARD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqyWRSqOy4)

I'm thinking of similar parts as in the video from BangGood, but maybe the quality is not good enough? We are not going to ride the e-skate in traffic for a start. If we can get the board to run reasonably well and safely on a level surface we will be more than happy.

One thing I'm thinking of is if I can maybe save some money by reusing my Arduino or Raspberry Pi and use a breakout board for an ESC controlled by the Pi/Arduino. Seeing the prices for a cheap VESC this might not be worth the effort though ( See this one: [Flipsky ESC on BangGood](https://www.banggood.com/FLIPSKY-FSESC-50A-SK8-ESC-Electronic-Speed-Control-5V-BEC-for-Electric-Longboard-RC-Car-E-bike-p-1293459.html?rmmds=cart_middle_products&cur_warehouse=CN#jsReviewsWrap)).

You are going to have to choose max speed or max distance as well as function/ performance vs reliability. Because you can not have both is a $500 budget.

hey my name is Jay. Im a new member and new to this community. I used to skate all through my younger years but launched myself into a busy work life early on.. so in all senses lost touch with my skateboarding routes. As i learned of electric skateboards i got more and more interested in the scene. I have since bought a budget board (backfire g2s) for my wife, and a diy kit for myself. I went with the backfire g2s for my wife because shes literally 100lbs soaking whet with a parka on. Whereas i went with a diy 10s5p kit for me self because im a larger 250lb guy, and well i figured i needed the extra :zap: . All that being said.. i am currently waiting on the diy kit, as well as a set of mbs wheels and a drop down deck. Looking forward to learning from as many folks as i can and possibly meeting some too! I live in Ottawa Ontario. Later!

I replace mine with surfrodz.  But they are high end. $100+ and you still need mounts.
Im not 100% sure if the motors in the 10s5p kit will fit on caliber trucks. If not than TB 218 trucks will work.
By replacing the trucks in that kit. Youll need to replace your mounts and probably belts too.

I am generally knowledgeable about these  things but i dont feel comfortable enough to starting soldering and wiring anything quiet yet. im in no way shape or form a pro at anything except maybe being a dad :sunglasses: so i really feel like i will take away from this first initial experience with this diy kit all the things i want and dont want out of an eboard.  i make a modest living, so like you said, with patience and good luck, i may be able to create a more reliable/ well suited board for my needs right here!

What's up guys. I'm aiming to build a board that's better than the extended range Boosted Board. I want a 20+ mile and about 30 mph for top speed. Don't have a name for it yet. I've done a decent amount of reading. I've only purchased 3 LiPo 4s1p 8000mAh batteries for a 12s setup. Looking at a lot of parts from DIY as far as motor, remote controller, ESC. Not too comfortable with being sure about what parts are compatible with what as far as Max amp capabilities. I think I found the right BMS. It's a Supower for 12s on eBay for 95. Battery has a 30C rating so my concern is the amperage capabilities of the parts being all over the place. I also saw another Bestech BMS on buildkitboards for like 50 bucks. Any recommendations welcome. Didn't find much about BMS on here (yet..?). Thanks!

Hi Everyone! Stumbled across this site looking for my next esk8. Half a year ago I bought my girlfriend an electric scooter, and as kind of an after thought bought myself a wowgo2s just as something to ride along with her on. I've never been a skateboarder, just 4-5 trips a year for snowboarding is the closest I've gotten. When I first got on the board... I have to admit, I panicked at how torque-y and difficult to control it was. I was ready to throw it in the trash!

Fast forward 6 months and I can't get enough! I absolutely love my wowgo. I ride it absolutely every chance I get. It totally reminds me of my first ever motorcycle, I have the same obsession I did then. And just like that 250cc starter bike, my wowgo has gone from an absolute rocket ship I could barely control, to a slow starter board! What had felt blazing fast and torque-y is now, well, not quite boring but I want more!

I've gone ahead and done the paris trucks upgrade. That helped. But I've noticed that the handle cut out makes the deck unbalanced in carving left and right. I had been trying to find out what deck I should buy which led me to this wonderful site!

So here I am at a crossroads. Is it worth it to upgrade the deck? Should I just start my build and then sell the wowgo? Buy a Raptor 2 and be done with it? I've learned from RC car building that it's usually better to buy the 'kit' and your own electronics. Plus I have fun building things.

Can anyone link to any beginner friendly builds people have done? I get that the magic of DIY is you can tailor your build to your needs but I don't know enough to even know what I want!

Hey man, I started off more or less similar with you :slight_smile:

Never skated before at all but I've rode my electric scooter daily for close to a year because that's how I commute to work :smiley:

I decided to shift to skateboard mainly due to it being 'cooler' and also more lightweight compared to the scooter that I own :confused: 

I got an Ownboard W1S that is practically the same with the Wowgo 2S and I've done the caliber 2 truck upgrade as well, it rides really well now with the orangatang nipples bushings and I've happy with it :smiley:

My next plan is to redo the board with belt drive motors + VESC 6.6 but retaining the W1S parts as a base for now as I don't want to blow a huge budget now :sweat_smile:

Thanks for the reply. I've only ever experienced my hub motors. I'm leaning towards belt drive next. The positives I've read about belts that stand out to me are: serviceability, expanded wheel options, and acceleration. Plus I always like to try something different. Up until I joined this forum I only knew about belt drive and hub motors. I'm open to other drive options.

I am very happy with my wowgo, like I said, I still love the thing to death. Actually the biggest issue I have right now is range. I bought the "middle" battery option for range and I've found it to be a bit limiting. My girl and I often ride to the cafe on Sundays for breakfast. Going there and coming back is nearly the extent of my range. And the board slows waaaaaay down by the time I'm back in my driveway. Plus there are some cafes another mile or two away in the downtown area.... :skateboard::skateboard::skateboard:

Fist thing you do is to start reading, read everything and anything on here and then it looks to me like a choice.  Re-purpose the wowgo or build something else and keep the wowgo as a back up.
Build a new satellite motor set up. (read about belt drive) This is the most expensive route and will be the most challenging.
First time building I would be considering buying a good quality kit.  Its the perfect way to get familiar with the components and yet have the security of a system that goes together and works.  Very much like the rc kits you mentioned.  
Belt drive is great set up compared to hubs as the gearing allows you to customize your torque and speed and choose full urethane wheels or indeed pneumatics.  
Have a look through this site for complete kits or part kits.  Gear is very good quality and the owner is here on the forum. @torqueboards 
products/pro3-electric-skateboard-conversion-kit
The kit linked includes everything you need to build a killer board on the deck of your choice but go through the whole site because its a lot of fun.
Alternatively you could upgrade the wowgo to a Direct Drive system with a new battery and vesc's (read about vesc)
Decent direct drive motors coupled with vesc will also allow you to program your torque and will be head and shoulders better than the wowgo if you couple them with a decent battery. ( Read about batteries) and direct drive will also allow you to choose your urethane. (read about DD)
Personally speaking I would be thinking along the lines of building new and keeping the wowgo for an upgrade later because lets face it you can never have too many boards.
First job though is to read.

A wise man once told me the perfect number of boards is one more than you have right now.  

Welcome to Hotel California my friend and good luck

Hi, new here. I'm currently living in Socal and I'm really enjoying my new Torquboards 12s dual 6374 belt driven build. I'm planning on adding a 5v system for lights etc. I'm trying to make a versitile board, that can be tuned and easily modified for either distance or speed. Tested my current setup, and it goes a tad over thirty. I'd like to be able to hit fifty, so I'm thinking maybe getting hooked up with some of @psychotiller six shooters, and maybe upgrading to VESC six. Currently have dual flipskys with max amps 70 each, I'll probably bump those up to 80 each. If I'm going for speed, and not to worried about distance am I better off getting some high DC lipos?

Hey all,

After riding an ebike my brother built, I decided to look into building an esk8. I've pored over the forum and questioned a few experienced builders on here to get an idea of what to build and what it will cost (along with the help of my brothers DIY knowledge of batteries and my other brothers electrical engineering knowledge).

Here's the plan:

12s5p 30q battery 
focbox unity
dual 190kv 6374 3200W motors (From forum member)
152mm (6'') pneumatic wheels (From forum member)
15mm wide belts on 15/60T pulleys (From forum member)
MBS matrix II trucks
Custom deck (From forum member)

Which leaves BMS's for battery, battery enclosure and a hand controller.

Any suggestions/criticisms are more than welcome.

Cheers

For South Africa @brenternet can give you some good tips.
In general look that you order from as less places as possible to save on shipping which can easily add up to 30%+ of the build price on top.

So I just figured out how to find the bottom of a 1515 thread post lol. So hello esk8 fam my names Jrod and from The Deserts of Southern California is where I rest and ride. I have a wife a 3 kids. The kids longboard and the adults EBoard. We call it eboarding generally because ESk8ing is illegal here but as recently redefined EMBoarding(electric motorized board) is not. I used to skate and BMX back in the HS days(05). I never new about longboarding till I moved to the mountains years ago (2013) for a job and seen the culture, but I moved backed down to the desert and there just wasn't a place for that out here. 5-6 years later I discovered that there is something and that's it's all my youth (Skate, Off road, BMX, RC, building something from nothing, tinkering) into one. I first built an ebike out of a drill motor and duct tape, maybe a few screws and pieces of wood(wish I had pics of that). I eventually baught a diy kit for it... but it was just a lil fun. After that I baught a Revel Drive kit for $800 with a magnito deck and I was hooked. I of course needed another and built an AWD Revel that gave me the experience that I needed to know what is best for the desert and me. Their system is pretty much perfect for the SF, SD, or just about any major city area, and for the most 
part works just fine on these sidewalks and bikeways. But as an off roading nut I must have more. Revel is in works of building something AT but I haven't seen it yet. Since I started riding this last year, I've lost 30lbs just from getting out and riding 5+miles a day. Im about 230 now, which is why I went Revel, simply put revel provided a system that was weighted for 265, and in just about two and half months I lost a bunch of weight. Seeing how they aren't releasing an off road version and seeing how my Family has really gotten into the sport of longboarding and cruising, my wife is letting me build my own. Checking my Google news feed is what led me to this group so I'm blessed for that. Our diy system is in the works and a prototype should be on its way soon. We are very excited to be apart of the ESk8ing community and can't wait to be showing up to the events around the globe. Stay safe and stay quick. ☮️![IMG_20190128_215728743|666x500](upload://78AhayXfVWgRZSEyJOAemq4Atm0.jpeg) ![IMG_20190119_202349381_HDR|666x500](upload://mW6hlBJbUqE8O5d39t98S1WpwrR.jpeg) ![IMG_20190119_202516496|375x500](upload://dvruLBOWoSI49jsdnIG0ZoTpkyC.jpeg)

Hi, I just joined because I need advice building a esk8 board. Ive been pushing on my longboard for 2 years and am currently living in South Korea. I ordered a AILERON 121c  deck and will use it as a base for the build.

Im having a hell of a time finding a battery store to purchase samsung batteries. The best results ive been able to find is through google (where to purchase 18650 battery in korea). Also, im not sure if the 18650 is the best battery to buy, because of the higher mAH and amperage in the 21700. I will have limited space with this deck, so any guidance pointing me in the right direction for purchasing and a specific battery type would be appreciated.

For the ESC, is the standard a vsec, or is the FOXBOX better because of its plug n play ability?

Thanks in advance!

Hi and welcome!
You can use the search function to find multiple discussions about which cells are the best, same about advantage/disadvantages of different cell sizes.
There are multiple vesc designs available, which one you choose is up to your budget and requirements of your build.
No one of them is a plug and play.
Also not focbox/focbox unity

I did, and there is too much information. Someone says the 18650 are best because of their production standards and reliability, another says the 27100 are better and newer but dont have the same output, or reliability so I cannot make a clear decision.

The requirements were already stated. I have a smaller deck, so that means I can only fit so many cells (as many as possible) and a esc. Changing the wheels, motors, trucks, receiver or anything else would be second.

So you undetstood that there is no clear answer to your question. It’s all up to your personal preference and your budget.
My personal preference would be the Samsung 30q cell. They have a good capacity and can put 20a per cell.
According your other questions you didn’t specify anything.
We don’t know:
Do you use one or two motors
Which motor size
Which range you want to reach
What is your budget
Do you live in a hilly area
How heavy you are
How heavy you want your build to get
What you much current you want your vescs to handle
Is it important for you that the vesc has an anti spark switch integrated or will you go with a discharge bms 
Etc etc

Well with as many cells i could fit under that deck, which is a small and light deck/build. The board is feather light, so all the weight would be in the motors and batteries. The area from truck to truck is 19x8.7, so it would be at a minimum 10s, but more likely 12s. It is still in shipping, so when I receive it, i need to find a store that sells the 18650s in order to gague the exact number of cells. With that you know the range will be limited to 10-12s, and I cannot see using one motor with that much power. It wouldn't matter what my weight is or how hilly it is with that much power. I imagine it would weigh approximately 25lbs and be able to go over 20 miles without having to worry about hills.

Im really having trouble finding a store or supplier in this country though.

Your range not only depends if 10 or 12s, it depends more on how much cells you add in parallel.
You can use only one motor even with a 12s20p battery pack.
Your pack just output as much as you ask for, or as much as it max can.
Have a look at ru.nkon.nl for cells.
They maybe ship also to Korea

There are no US shippers who will ship lion or lipo batteries to this country without shipping it as HAZMAT. If they do ship it as HAZMAT then the cost is outrageous.

So I spend all day looking for the 30Q Samsung cells in Vape stores. They are all over the place here. I went to 10-15 stores and very few (maybe 3) had legit cells, additionally the only legit cells they had were 25R and wanted to charge w12,000 or about $11 per cell. Every other place had fake cells from China wrapped in the pink Samsung wrapper.

I ended up placing an order through Nkon. I found out they had solder tabs, so thats really awesome and will really help me build the pack. I ordered 36 plus a couple extra, so I am going to try to fit a 12s3p under the deck.

Thanks again!

I am a complete newbie live in Wisconsin.  I am 57 years old, retired for 6 months, married for 35 years, the father of 2 grown boys and a grandpa to 3 little boys ages 2, 4 and 7.  I live in an area where I very seldom see a skateboarder.  I have never skate boarded. I am 6’2” tall and about 245 pounds.  I'm a big guy and know it and I am working on it.  I am a BS in Electrical Engineering and an MS is Mechanical Engineering.

Now the really crazy part for a guy like me - I want to buy, and possibly eventually build,  an electric longboard and learn to ride it.  I plan to start by purchasing an Evolve GT with AT Wheels.  You are probably laughing right now but I am serious!  I am an outgoing fellow and in my younger years climbed all over the world, ran 42 marathons, bicycled across the USA twice- but that was all a long time ago.  In Wisconsin here people will think I am nuts and have lost my mind but I don’t care.  I live out in the country.  The roads are all paved and mainly low traffic.  The pavement is sometimes worn and abrasive but normally does not have potholes, etc.  I could ride for miles.  The terrain is slightly rolling with small gradual hills.

Is it reasonably possible for someone who is enthusiastic like me to learn to ride an Evolve electric board?   I am serious about this!

At present it is winter here in Wisconsin and I couldn’t ride her until mid April.  I would like to get geared up between now and that time.  😊

Please let me know your thoughts.  I really need some experienced guidance to get going and start out correctly this late in my life.

I don't plan to ask or get anyone's approval here from my family or friends.  I am just going to do it and learn through doing and the road rash and fun that comes from learning something new.  I look forward to meeting many of you online!

Thank you!

I'm officially invested in your success brother! I'm 27, but like you, had never skated before finding this place. I highly suggest looking into a full DIY build. The general saying here is buy it nice or buy it twice. We're all here to help so feel free to ask as many questions as you want in the [noob thread](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/noob-question-thread-ask-your-questions-here/9559) or once you reach a higher member level you can make your own thread specific to your build plan. 

The very best place for you to start is [here](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/is-diy-esk8-right-for-you/84563) to decide if DIY is right for you (I think it is, you're an engineer)

And then [here](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/start-here-faq-for-diy-electric-skateboard-builders/215) once you decide you're committed to building the perfect board for you and not one built for the masses.

Good luck in your journey!

Hello all! Im 42 male originally from Florida. Spent the last 5 years in Wyoming and just moved to salt lake city utah. I have been riding a santa cruz bigfoot board in Wyoming but it was syolen when i moved here...along with everything i owned..no worries. Ive only riddien a drop through once and it was ok...i am an old surfer so really all i do is big carves and curb to curb carves on hills..i dont have a liscence anymore and i cant push a board with my foot anymore so electric is my future vehicle for life. Anyone have an opinion on the company full bag???

Hi @Andreu
3D printed mounts will not really work for long as long as you don’t plan to support them with other materials.
On the bms side you need first to decide if you want a charge only or a charge and discharge bms for your board. Than we can give you some recommendations which model to choose. 

By the way, it’s Ah no A for your battery capacity 😉

@BuckyBadger
Welcome here! Like your attitude! Never too old to start something new.. 👌 and don’t worry, you not the only one who never really was skating before. Start slowly and things will come over time.
I started last year with getting a boosted. 2month later i was fully into diy...
If you enjoy building, I wouldn’t go with an evolve.
Not want to say they bad choice.
But anyway your first build will need an improvement, doesn’t matter if you had a prebuilt before or not.
So i would rather spend the money to build a diy and after use the money safed to adjust it like you want than to get a evolve and spend 400-500$ for a battery update.
Take your time reading here. @venom121212 linked some good threads to start with.
If you done with some research just start your own build thread and ask the things you not sure in. Here are a lot of experienced builder and rider willing to help you to find your right way!

Hello there, I'm Jarno and planning on making my first esk8.
I am looking to make a board that can go up to 30km/h with a range of 22km in a country without hills.
My budget will be a maximum of 1200$ but whould like to spend less.
So far I think I'll need a single motor with a VESC motor controller and a 10S2P 5000Ah LiPO pack.

I used the calculator at https://calc.3dservisas.eu to find my range. And the budget is a ceiling I will not pass and prefer to stay far under.
More range whould be nice but it whould also cost more and I don't know how many LiPOs will fit under a board, whould you know how many whould fit in most normal cases?
Should I also look at waterproof motors? since it can rain suddenly.

Personally, I'm a fan of lithium ion packs. I think you can build a great board under your budget. Most unsealed motors have a decent waterproofing on them but you can always disassemble them and take extra waterproofing protection.

Seeing as Liion packs can have many more discharge cycles it does indeed look like a good option since with my wanted max speed I won't need as much current as other builds.
Do you have any sugestions for motors and Lithium ion packs?

You have to take the motor apart and make it waterproof yourself.  If you run unsensored, water won't hurt the motor **electrically** (but still can eat bearings eventually).  Only the sensors are affected by water.

I don't like uncensored though...

Hello,  I have been reading here for a while and decided to register about 3 weeks ago.  I started out on a boosted board and LOVED the ride but became frustrated with the poor range and small wheels. I sold my boosted board on Ebay and ordered a Trampa Orrsom longboard with pneumatic 6.5" tires and a dual motor setup.  I have the 12s LIPO setup in place now, but I ordered a K-Weld spot welder and plant to build a 12s 18650 battery.  I also plan to swap out the Trampa 154kv motors for Maytech 200kv motors as I like to go FAST!  I am looking forward to modifying my Trampa board and building my own battery pack. . My long term goal is to design and build a board from the ground up.  Thanks to all who are sharing what they know,, this is truly a living encyclopedia if esk8 building knowledge.  I will continue to read and hopefully be able contribute as time goes on.

I am a stepwise DIYer.  A long time surfer that never rode a skateboard until this past December.  I saw someone on an electric skateboard and thought it looked like fun.  So I did a little research, and being an engineer in a similar field, chose an Exway - which offers a lot of techie stuff.  I hoped to be able to commute the short 2 miles I have to work.  I fell in love with it instantly and it only took about a month before I ran out of range on that.  So I purchased a Bamboo GTX AT.  My short commute goes over very ragged roads in an industrial park - the trucks tear up the roads.  Now I regularly go out for 8 to 10 mile rides and I'm looking for more engineery perfection.  I have replaced the bushings and dropped in ceramic bearings.  Purchased a torque screwdriver so I can play with low torques on the small hardware on the board.  I tried valiantly to balance the stock Evolve AT wheels/tires but determined it isn't possible so I have ordered a set of Six Shooters with the 60t gears.  I am going through the excellent calculators you have provided and I believe the stock 15t motor gear works and I will need 74 tooth belts, although I plan on double checking that before ordering the belts.  I liked the smooth acceleration of the Exway so after the wheels I will replace the speed controller with a VESC.  Eventually, when I am satisfied, (I understand I will be wanting a new battery next) I will move everything to a new DIY board and put all the stock gear back on the Evolve for friends to ride.  This way I can take my time to get a build right while still being able to ride every day.

Hey all, I'm Paul!  Former downhill longboarding speed addict.  I hung up my slide gloves for mostly flatland distance skating when I moved to the Sacramento valley 8 years ago but I've been itching for that speed fix ever since.  I'm on the finishing stages of my first mountain board build with a MBS Leon Robbins pro 100, Unity, dual 6374 motors, and a 12s6p battery.  I've got a 14 tooth motor pulley and 72 tooth wheel pulley because I was hoping for some solid Hill climb ability as well as the speed and distance.  Huge thanks to this forum and all the regulars. I had no idea how to do any of this when I started but did a boat load of reading and taking notes.  I'm sure there's still a lot to learn too.

Hello everybody!

Never ridden a skateboard before, but always dreamed of it. I'm only in the thinking stages right now, but I would love to eventually DIY a cheap, but upgrade-able board. I've seen plenty of Instructables, but only recently stumbled into these forums, so I have a lot of reading to do :smiley:

Eventually I would like to use an esk8 for my daily commute, but I'm currently 20 miles from work, so I'll move first. I'm likely to be more interested in building than riding, but we'll see. (I'm only 100 lbs, so I'm sure I'll be flying) Also, I'm a programmer and own a 3D printer... for fun

Hi, I'm Dave, and I just found out about eSkates last week. I got to ride an E-GO2 last Friday, and the motor was fried after just one day. I'll be moving on to something proper now that I'm hooked.

I'm very much into diy electronics (mostly class a audio amplifiers) and I've recently acquired a 3D printer. The plan is to either build something nice with maybe direct drive motors, or buy a pre-built esk8 like the slick urban kick, or both (in reversed order). I'll have to do more research before I make a decision. 

See y'all around!

I skate in NC and I want to do downhill runs alone by using an electric motor to get me to the top instead of bringing someone else with a car.  The run I'm considering is around 8% grade the whole way down, 3 miles long, and has a few hairpins that you have to slide.

Do you think it is possible to build an electric board that is also good for downhill?  
I do not need brakes and I feel like it would be possible to charge the battery with the speed from going downhill, but im not sure cause all of this is really new to me.  Im mostly concerned that it wont work well with changing out wheels a lot, or sliding will mess it up somehow. Thanks!!!

While it's definitely possible to do, I'm not sure how good of a final product you will have for downhill. 

Since saving weight is key, you will only want to use as many batteries as you need. Perhaps a 10s2p pack or a configuration of lipos will work, you will have to play around with specs like weight and amperage and capacity to see what is best for your situation.

While a single motor won't be much fun all it has to do is get you to the top of the hill so for you a dual setup won't be worth the price and weight. Likely belt drive as it's reliable and cheap + you can take off the belt before shredding down the hill. This will remove drive train friction.

@okp is making some pulleys for venom magnums and i think @PXSS has some Speed Vent pulleys in the making (or someone else does)  

The classic skate trucks compatible esk8 motor mounts include Caliber 2, Surf Rodz, and a few others I'm forgetting. Generally anything that doesn't have a rounded hanger likely has a matching mount.

Hey everyone!

Canadian living in California (Silicon Valley Bay area). New to the Esk8 community and totally stoked to build my own board. I've done a metric tonne of research and every.bloody.day I'm learning something new. Thanks to everyone for providing a tonne material for me to read and consume. I've been snowboarding for about 22 years, racing motorcycles for about 4 years (still do the odd track day) and have been athletic for most of my life. I'm hoping that all of this translates into a smooth transition into a fun new way to commute to work every day. I'm fortunate enough to have a trail practically right from my home straight to work (11km on the trail with 1km off trail).

Anyway... on to my first build and already looking to build my 2nd (I obsess with any new learning experience and hobby). Please feel free to tell me if I'm missing anything else as I've already purchased the gear listed below:

**_Purchased:_**
* Board: LandYachtz Evo 40 Falcon
* Motor: Dual TB 6374 190Kv
* Belts: TB 320mm 15mm HTD5
* Trucks: TB 218mm
* Wheels: TB 110mm 78A Kegel Core
* Pulleys: TB 15T motor pulley and 36T wheel pulley (debating about bumping wheel pulley to 40T for a little bit more bottom end)
* Motor Mounts: TB red reversible 63mm mounts
* ESC: FOCBOX Unity **_(waiting for it to arrive)_**
* Battery: 12s4P with xt60 **_(waiting for it to arrive)_**
* Switch: ON/OFF anti-spark switch from Mboards **_(waiting for it to arrive)_**
* Remote: Maytech
* Enclosure: Eboards Peru for EVO 40 **_(waiting for it to arrive)_**
* 6 x 8mm 3.5mm male to 5.5mm female extension wires
* Flipsky motor sensor wires

**_Safety gear (I'm simply reusing my motorcycle street gear - already owned):_**
* AGV K3 full face (I'm debating about getting a helmet that will allow for more peripheral vision). I have clear and tinted visors
* Alpinestars GP Pro R2 Gloves
* I'm not going to use my race boots and jacket because they may be a bit too stiff. Open to more recommendations

**_What I don't have:_**
* elbow and knee pads - recommendations?
* thinking about headlights and rear lights just in case I get caught working late  - recommendations? I've read all about shredlights, but open to any other suggestions
* battery percentage gauge - recommendations?
* Anything else you folks can think of?

Thank you and looking forward to getting on the trails!

First off, great way to introduce yourself to the forum...much appreciated that you have done your research and enjoy the learning process.

-Careful using motorcycle helmets instead of downhill, slightly different design for slightly different purposes. There's a bunch of debate about it around but protection is protection so you're already winning in my book.

-shredlights are ok. The rechargeable aspect is cool but the light isn't too helpful visually for you. It's more for other cars to see you hopefully. I have them and am considering changing them out for some high power cree lights that run off a separate small rechargeable battery pack (not your main, that power is for you)

-@janpom's DAVEga is an awesome little battery meter that also tells you tripometer info, motor temp info, etc. 

I'd link threads like a gentleman but I've been drinking so you gotta search it yo self. Great to have you here man!

Thank you.

There's no way in hell I'd ever ride without a helmet or proper gear for that matter.

I've looked at the downhill helmets online, but not in person. I'll head into a local shop to try them on and see how much of a difference there is and talk to staff, then I'll pull the trigger if I decide to go that way.

I could always use my headlamp. It's 300 lumens with a theoretical distance of 80 meters. That should be good enough as long as I'm not going too fast and out pacing my ability to react.

I just checked out @janpom 's gadget... that's awesome!

Hi all,

I'm new to this board. I started 3 years ago with an OneWheel which is a great toy.
I was addicted right off my first ride.
A year later a an Evolve GTX followed, which is a great board, too.
I really liked long rides. Even if the battery of the evolve is OK I wanted way more range.
Because I wanted more I started to build my new board based on the trampa platform.
It is a dual VESC mountain  board with a huge battery (10s9p) which allows me 60+ km rides.

I'm located in Hamburg, Germany

Hi Guys,

Joined to get some support with using the VESC, reverse engineering the onewheel design for fun and because they are stupidly expensive here in Australia. Started out with a RC ESC and as that wasn't working have now upgraded to a VESC. Having some weird motor issues that I am looking to find fixes for.

Anyway DIY onewheel currently has a 330kv RC motor and 6S LiPo. Geared with a bike chain ~6:1 to a 10" go kart tyre. Will be incorporate gyro/accelerometer-based control method on an Arduino, ESP32 or similar after I get the mechanical bits working.

Hello eSk8 family.  Another new guy checking in.  Used to skate if you can call what I did skate back in the 80s.  Got back on a board 5 years ago with my son but he lost interest so that was that.  I am a tinkerer at heart and could never leave anything stock alone, my cars, motorcycles, RC trucks etc.  Stumbled on this site a while ago as I have been googling electric boards for some time and have been learning a lot here and seeing some awesome builds.  Thanks in advance for some of my dumb questions!

Hey I am a noob here but wanted to start with some wierd questions. 
If someone wanted to connect solar panels to any type of E-board, how would you inject the power?
For example, if the pack is 10S, that would mean the voltage between the pack and the ESC will vary from 42V charged to 30V discharged. Could I parallel a 48V panel directly to the ESC input voltage lines and use blocking diodes to stop current backflow into the panels? Or would you use a solar panel power controller. If I used a solar controller my problem is they are designed to output to 12V or 24V battery banks. And yes I plan on using the panels for continuous charging while riding as supplementary power, and to charge the battery when I am not riding it

Hi All.  I've just bought a trampa mountainboard and will be putting it (and me) through its paces.  This follows some fun with an Evolve Carbon GT (positive experience) but the want / need for more range, power and engineering for all terrain.

I'd be happy to catch up with any fellow Trampa board owners, especially in the UK, South East.

Hello, I am trying to make a set of custom motor mounts to use on narrow trucks. I have access to a 3d printer for prototypes before cnc but I have no clue how I should make the mount so the motors will fit and no foul play, etc. I have been playing with the idea of having the motor pulleys on the outside of the truck. Anyone have any ideas? I really like these narrow trucks and would love to electrify them. My current solution that works is hard mounting the motors to the deck in between the deck and baseplate. My rear trucks are at 0 degrees and very hard bushings so they rear truck doesn't move at all. I am coming from a primarily downhill longboarder, but I'd also love to go uphill. imgur . com/a/Q11oqy1

Cool trucks, I would recommend making axles that are a little like this

![image|690x336](upload://r3rPLmz3smQ3pSzZQlKvGPTYYIh.jpeg) 

So you can mount motor plates onto them

the axles don't need to be that long.

Hello! I'm Jacob from Grand Rapids, MI! I've been building eBikes for about 4 years. I'm now interested in trying out making an eBoard.  My idea is to start out as simple, basic and inexpensive as possible: To use one of my leftover batteries, secure it to a piece of leftover wood, and then basically slap on the wheels and some grip to create an extremely janky commuter board. My main concerns are the weight of the battery as well as the continuous and peak Amps of the battery not being up to spec for these high torque motors. I could be wrong, this isn't the place to discuss it, and this is a long enough intro as it is! Hope I don't crash and die! (again).

Hey Esk8! This is JT. I want to thank everyone here that contributes and shares their info, creativity, ingenuity and time. I used to skateboard some back in the day and recently got into the esk8 community through my Backfire G2 Black. So far, it is great and has a lot of great things to offer at a budget. But as so many have said before, I want more. My desire would be an AT board with nice flex and 30/30 (30 mph and solid 30 mile range or more;) However, I think for now I will stick with the premade boards for now and check out ways to maintain and then see others' unique builds, etc. Thanks!!

Hello everyone!
        Quick rundown on me. I am combat medic in the Army and I am finishing up my nursing degree and will graduate in December. My son got interested in electric skateboards so I bought him an inexpensive Liftboard and I have to say it is a lot of fun especially since I haven't been on a skateboard in probably 30 years. Needless to say my son saw one of those cool Bajaboards so my best alternative is to build an off road board with my son. I'm pretty decent with basic electronics and have started buying parts for his board. We decided to go with a simple single drive set up and will consider a dual drive once he gets better. I bought one of those off road type long boards with 6" pneumatic tires off ebay, a small pelican case, another 6" wheel with gear and a motor mount kit. I'm currently looking for a good battery, motor and ESC to go with it. We pretty much are trying to build a low cost "Patriot" type board that we can upgrade along the way. Instead of just building the board I want to use this as an opportunity to teach my son basic electronics and the physics behind the drivetrain components/characteristics. I am sure once we are done I will have to build one of my own. I will post some pictures along the way. Anyways that's a little about me and my first project with my son!

Heya everyone! Jordan here from Ottawa, Canada!

Been working on my board for a while now while busy with my real life lol. It's been a labor of love with lots of trial and error, but I should have it running for next spring :slight_smile:

Currently need new ESCs (looking at dual flipsky but not sure yet) and a new BMS since my current one is kinda bad.

My board is a 6S 16Ah Lipo setup with dual 580kv motors, pushing around 4kW total (yes, I know my kv is way too high, but I bought the motors before I knew better). 

Looking forward to being a part of the community!

Next step will be to buy electronic parts like cells, bms, esc and motors. I have red a lot about that topic and have found some parts that may work. I just want to be sure i cant do something better. Do you have something like will it work section, where you can write the parts combo and others would just give theirs option on that?

So I have this mellow board that is pretty much a wrap as far as the battery is concerned. I'd like to do something with the remains I'm pretty sure I can use the rear axle and Motors somehow I have the complete ESC . I also have the complete battery but something from that is preventing it from charging. Need advice for that too also suggestions as far as remote or what I could do with this

Hi everyone. My name's Mark. I've been lurking on your forum for little over a month now. Just finally made an account. Im really new to esk8ing. I've always had a passion for skateboarding on trick boards but that was years ago. Life kinda happened and got busy. I just bout my first esk8 board for commuting to work.  First time I rode it was a blast. Instantly fell in love with this new hobby. I'm wanting to mod it and make it a little more rugged. I work for a CNC machine shop as an operator and Im mechanically inclined but am not good when it comes to electric stuff. So I'm hoping to learn from you guys. I'm very fascinated with some of the builds I've seen from you guys so far. I'm on a budget tho and I have a few ideas for my first DIY build but for now I just want to improve my board for commuting and have fun with it. While I save some money up and I hope you guys will welcome me into the community here

Hi. I am trying to learn how to work with SPIM08HP 200A packs from batteryhookup. I bought 150 of them. So far I am just charging and discharging them to get them up to speed. Some are coming up 10550mAh. WOW! I cant figure out how to measure internal resistance of each pack. I want a 10s 4p.

Hello,

My name is Daniel and I'm here to report the fraud that is Enertion Boards.

Beware of these scammers. They accepted the return of a Focbox Unity and after several months waiting, I have not received the money. Now I have neither the money nor the Focbox. They do not answer emails. I have already initiated legal action against them for fraud.

I will not stop until I get my money.

Hi Guys
I have been a long boarder for well, long.  I skated around India & Thailand 20 years ago on a Buddha Board equipped with the 'convert any skate board with the 100m High tractor wheels & raiser kit' Im 53 now and don't bounce like I used to & don't regularly skate.  So I got me a second hand 'HELVEI Motorised SmartMove Longboard Skateboard with Rechargeable Battery Pack, Dual Motors 1800 W and Remote – Black'  unfortunately the remotes battery didn't last long at all.  I have tried replacing the battery (well soldering another one on the inside the housing but soldering is not my thing & have tried to get other remotes to match up with the board to no avail.  Can anyone tell me whats the best remote to buy for this?  Ps Helvei sell thru amazon etc & have never got back to me when trying to contact them, hell I even said I would buy 100 boards off them to get a responce but nothing came back!

You'll probably have to also replace the receiver (if that's even possible on your esc) unless it's a generic, re-pairable RC controller.

Come over and check out https://forum. where there are more folks to help you out. This forum is dead.

Hey there.

Des here from sunny South Africa.

I got my first skateboard in the late 70's (remember Snowy Smith?)  and there's always been a board of sorts around.

A few years ago, my son got into skateboarding and recently picked up one of these for cheap because he thought it would be fun. 

(won't let me insert image or link, but basically a Skatey 800 )

It worked, but range and runtime were bad, so we replaced the battery's.  This did improve things, but range improved to about 2km and runtime about 20 minutes.  Batteries do charge and hold their charge, but seem quite depleted after the short time.

So we are thinking about what needs to be replaced / repaired / upgraded.  I know this is quite old tech and possibly a bit outdated, and we will never get to the level of some of the new boards or probably even the range of 30km etc that these boards advertised when new.  But even if we could get it to, say 10km and an hour of use, it would be some good fun.

So, I'm getting to grips with this forum and doing the search thing, but in the meantime, could anyone point me in the right direction of what / where I can look?

Any help greatly appreciated.
