Planning in being in Barcelona for a week in Feb/March. Considering how to bring my esk8, and came across this esk8 ship that seems to rent decks etc. Are they on the forum or anyone in Barcelona that is familiar?  Not great decks but skips the hassle of bringing or shipping mine.

I believe I've seen these dudes. They rent huuuuge, heavy boards without a ton of range. If you have a smaller board you can bring you should. I think a small light board would be more fun along the beach there which is pretty damn nice.

yeah ! get a cruiser with you. This is going to make a huge diff in Barcelona. If you are a street skater... take your deck (or trucks) with you and buy a mini powell blank... go to MacBa... Barcelona was one of my favorite riding place. Universitat, Parallel, so much memories !

Do you know where I may be able to rent an electric skateboard somewhere in Barcelona? Or do you have any ideas.. I would like to tour the city on  Electric skateboard Rather than riding a bike
