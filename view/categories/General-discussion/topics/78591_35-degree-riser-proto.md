I'd recommend adding a triangular or crossbar brace of some sort... ![20181220_181946|375x500](upload://aKNXlbuty3SjuRq8i8vycsSJOdI.jpeg)  otherwise it's going to be weakest with stress in the direction of the yellow arrows.

Iâ€™ve already thought the same. Damn Solidworks. I get lost in its 3D world and always error on form over function. The mounting plates and welding fixture are on point though so that good.
