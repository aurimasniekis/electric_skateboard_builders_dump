I am trying to compile the motor options people have on the market today. There are 3 main caterories which I see
Budget: <$80 per motor
Race star 
Keda 
Propdrive
Mid-range: $80-$120 per motor
Torqueboards 
Sk3
Sk8
APS
May tech 
Flipsky
Performance: >$120 per motor

I‚Äôd also like to hear about the reliability of these motor manufacturers as it seems like loose magnets has become a big problem recently. Post below your options

I would include as min APS, Maytech and Flipsky motors too

The reliability of a motor also has a lot to do with whether you take it apart and waterproof the sensor assembly.  Regardless of brand.

@Andy87 I believe those are all in the mid category, no?

@b264 I have never done that because I‚Äôve only worked with torqueboards who already waterproof it.

APS yes, Maytech and Flipsky i can¬¥t say.
Never looked up price

Maytech is high/mid end for.price and quality

Depends where you order from

And just to note that the sk3 is on sale for like $60 right now

So one of the best motors out there is probably the cheapest out there

Add 10% off using HOBBYKING10 and then you have 2 motors for like ¬£81

I've got sk8's sk3's tb 6374's Maytech 6355's (i think, they've been in a drawer for a year) and a pair of rspec enertions which I have yet to try.   Out of all of the ones I've used my favs are the sk3's to date.  Stay the coolest under pressure and just work come rain or shine.  They make one of the best sounds in esk8 imo.  Sensors to me are a waste of time and just something else to go wrong.  My sk3 set up hill starts with very little cogging so I just don't see the need.

Sk3 is 32mm.
Should I get these for 50‚Ç¨ each  and sacrifice sensors, keyway, silicon wires, closed can?
Or should wait for Black Friday deals from esk8 vendors on maytechs?
```

## \#18 Posted by: moon Posted at: 2018-11-07T10:44:41.638Z Reads: 112

Imo

The closed can is a little bit of a gimmick and does more harm than good. But you are sacrificing the sensors and keyway. And silicone wires you can also add, same with sensors but idk

sk8 has no keyway too, i think.
but the sk8 190kV is stronger than the tb 6380 170kV...
as min that¬¥s what they write on the hk website...

I can vouch for Keda motors, I‚Äôve got 4. They are great for the price and have plenty of power, I just wish there was a 6374 model. 

And for proof I‚Äôve done @b264‚Äôs test and smashed them on the concrete at 30km/h, well not intentionally, all that happened was some minor scratches

Don't waste time or money on sk3. They suck to maintenance and they don't have keyways

I'm using torqueboards 6374's and was on the 6355's before and love them. The 74's have massive speed and torque and run amazingly even on a single motor setup.

I have read a lot about loose magnets recently. Maybe it is only with their newer models??ü§î

I'll definitely admit I had a couple issues with some loose magnets, but I think that's also on me because I had been using a single motor mount and not had it aligned very well, so I take some responsibility for magnet issues. I switched to fixed mounts recently to help better align my mounts and motors and they've been performing flawlessly since.

I've been looking at thier 6380 170kv motors the past few days every other hour.
Wish they were 180kv tho

I could go for a higher kv myself, but I feel like the 80's would be great single drive motors or for an offroader that needs the torque.

You will run into traction issues on single drive.

Just because the torque on the 80's? Was running a single 6374 the last year and never had any traction issues, but different motor.
