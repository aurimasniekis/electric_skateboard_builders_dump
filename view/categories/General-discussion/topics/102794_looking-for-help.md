I collected my motor, board, trucks, wheels, and a bunch more. I am looking for someone I can ship the lot to and have it assembled. I do not have the time/knowledge to complete this build. I am currently in OK. I had the battery built by bara a few years ago and I really want this finished. Any advice about who to contact or to put your name forward let me know!

I hope you did take care of the battery during this years without use... Many people could do it, also if you know someone that loves to learn stuff from the web, for sure it will build it for free... Hope you get your board running soon...
