Just curious what ideas or solutions you all have for board storage, racking, or work stands. Freestanding, mounted or other configurations? I was considering buying an off the shelf rack system, but always like to explore DIY options and get ideas before taking the plunge on a mass produced product. Also, I'm curious to know what might be available for work stand solutions to make it easier to work on our boards. I'm open to DIY solutions, or even other products that fit the bill, so let's see what you got!

Here's one rack I'm considering.

I don't have pictures, but I used guitar wall mounts to hold it up at the trucks. https://www.amazon.com/Top-StageÂ®-Essentials-Studio-GR5-Q2/dp/B00O4JRLU0/ref=sr_1_8?s=musical-instruments&ie=UTF8&qid=1468538530&sr=1-8&keywords=guitar+wall+hange
Don't know how strong they are, but my board is about 20 lbs and it works flawlessly

Edit: Looking through the forum, I think what I did might be the exact same thing that @link5505 did. Its great if you have more space upwards instead of outwards. I was able to mount 4 boards on a wall space about 35 inches wide, 130 inches tall

I support this notion.  I have boards of varying shapes and sizes and its NOT easy to deal with them.

Use the tornado hook series from the Home Depot just need to change the provided screws for longer ones and you'll all set.  
It cost $6.00 :astonished:

I use these mounted on two studs. Works great!

Thanks for all the ideas and links. I like the simple and low tech hooks and guitar hangers. I'm probably gonna get a couple of those and maybe supporting for one of the multi board racks as well for all my snowboards too.

That's my solution.
Two pieces of wood, a hacksaw and a drill.
I'm very happy with the result!
