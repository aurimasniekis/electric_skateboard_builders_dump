I've been looking for an audio solution that would fit a TSG Pass not finding anything specific but I did find this that uses vibration - anyone experience of this or similar? or how did you add audio to yours?

Vibro audio i guess without looking at the link is using some sort of vibration conductivity, i know that sound quality will be very poor compared to say a pair of cheap earbuds.

Yea, I kinda hoped the tech had gotten better recently :) 

I'm using buds right now but finding them really annoying, I've yet to find a set with a low profile that will stay in my ears while riding that don't get jammed while taking helm off :(

I use Jaybird freedom earbuds. You can usually get a pair for about $100 on Amazon during sales. Audio quality is really good and they're super low profile.

Otherwise than that I know sol makes some super low profile wired earbuds

Have you though about getting some padded over ear drivers off any headphones ie remove the headband and cut them into the foam of your helmet?

yes, this started when I considered using the drives from some old Sony over ear I had lying around

and considered these but they are not ideal

No problem. If the jaybirds break you can get them replaced. I'm pretty rough/unlucky with mine and I'm on my fourth pair or something ridiculous like that (to be fair, the first just had terrible connection and the second one had a faulty button, but the third one started cutting out on one ear)

I had something like that for touring around with my motorbike:

There are other types which you can velcro inside your helmet. Just google "helmet headphones"

My opinnion is that if you want to be a good driver of anything you need to have all your senses engaded and focus fully, I know people who were hurt and those who hurt others because of the phone, alcohol or just driving stupid and its not nice.

One thing is using earbuds or something like that and other thing is using normal car speakers, with them you hear the outside if you arent blasting

I have UClear as well rate them but watch your safety, pond is you are supposed to hear warning noises on an esk8, on a motorbike some will argue the same but it's over engine noise anyway

[/quote]

I have the same dilemma. On the one hand, listening to music I love while riding adds an element of enjoyment. On the other hand - to have complete awareness of my surroundings I need to hear what's going on... an approaching car is way less concerning if you hear it from 100 meters away!

Helmets with sound are 100% illegal in my country. Even if you use only one ear. You need to hear the sounds around you. It seems using one ear is legal everywhere else. 
Leaving aside the laws I recommend you to use only one ear. There's very small bluetooth devices that can fit inside a helmet.

thats the good thing about these flat earphones!
They don´t cover your ear completly, so you can adjust the volume, so that you´re able to hear all other sounds around you. It´s just like in a car if you don´t blast ´em up :slight_smile:

Music in your ear while driving sounds like a bad combination to me, especially when you have to be aware of you surroundings on these things. You gotta be able to hear things around you. That's why I choose speakers over earbuds.

I guess I picked up bad habits on my mountain bike, I only ever wear 1 bud unless I'm totally off-road (and even then only when I'm fairly isolated) 

I find I'm much more of a visual person, esp. with full face I check for movement around me. With the right tunes, my style improves and enjoy it more. 

I would NEVER wear even 1 bud on the road in traffic, I tend not to stick to roads/or pavements when I'm riding for fun I go where its smoothest ;)

yea so will never recommend wearing 2 buds, but if i’m wearing one bud with the volume low enough so I can still hear the surroundings i think it’s fine. it’s mostly for when i’m stopped at a light or a stop sign, not so much while i’m actively moving

i also use my 1 earbud for gps if i’m going places so i don’t have to look down at my phone while i’m riding, which I feel, is worse than gavin someone tell me where i’m going

Personally being a DJ/Turntablist i have no problem concentrating on separate audio sources while riding my bike for example while fully earbudded, but i only go full vol when off road and bombing it because im not looking back or around so much. But you cant beat a Minirig for a portable audio solution IMO.

As others have said...I hate ear buds because you can't hear your surroundings. But listening to music and driving or riding is something I enjoy.. and focusing on separate audio sources is pretty easy..when you don't use earbuds

I would always prefer not listening to music at all than using only one earbud and getting mono sound with crappy quality.

I never listen to music directly in my ears when driving (car, bike, eskate,etc...) but it's for obvious safety reasons :)

But don't you think this maybe can be annoying for the others people on your way, with your music ? I personally hate people playing music on their phone in the street, like if they were the only one around.

It wouldn’t really matter if you’re on a moving vehicle. You’re standing still  for what, a maximum of 5 mins at best ? 

There’s also other factors such as the fact that the cars around you may be going faster , slower, and not even the same route as you. Bottom line, playing music with speakers in the street ? No one is nor should care.

Nope... because I ride public streets with cars... Not normally around people. 

If you get upset about the half a second you hear it while I pass you at 30mph... Then probably should take up anger management. It's a bit different then walking by people playing music on my phone..which is also annoying and rude. But I don't subject myself to crowds on my board... Streets and cruise..

Do you get upset at the car next to you for playing thier music and enjoying thier drive?? Lol

I use these BE Link headphones for my full face helmets. They can go as loud as I want for off road riding or can be quiet enough to hear the music, but still everything around me. They Velcro inside the ear recesses in the helmet, so there is a little gap between your ear and the speaker to let outside sounds in. They sound pretty good, but they are a tad pricey. I don't know how often they go on sale, but I got mine with a beanie from Daddies board shop for $14 when they were on sale a while ago. I personally wouldn't listen to music if I was riding in traffic, but I pretty much only ride recreationally off road or where there are as few cars as possible.

All right...

First, I just ask a question (Do you think the music annoys people in the street ?) then I gave an opinion (I hate when people listen to music loudly in the street). So I never "attacked" you nor I said you should get some help from someone :( Where did you get that I was upset by those people or by the things I hate ? Or maybe do you think I was offensive to you ?

On this forum, I read a lot and usually don't post (because most of the member know more than me) but I think I'll continue if I get those kind of response and judgment...

years of riding track bicycles, road, mountain bicycles, sport bikes, dirt and supermotards as well as longboards... could never understand anyone who didn't want to tune in to their ride & to the trafic around them, Projected music is much safer, so you can hear the trafic too. Otherwise: Flat out is dangerous... except maybe climbing offroad where there is no trafic and speed is controled. Even on a closed course I wanted to listen & feel my bike, guess it depends how hard you are pushing, how aware and safe you want to be?

I meant no offense. Nor don't think you attacked me.

Don't take my response so seriously. Take it as a conversation.  Respond to it. 

I merely was speaking in generals. Not toward you.

Also @Slak I really hope I didn't scare you off from responding to other topics... 

I generally agree with you. The following make me mad lol
-music on the sidewalk around people when walking at relatively the same speed in the same direction.
-people that play music in stores/malls on thier phones and walking through crowds thinking they are cool lol. It's just annoying.
-pulling up to a light and someone has thier shitty music on full blast that doesn't have the decency to turn it down while stopped next to people(I turn my system down)

Things that I don't typically pay mind too
-vehicles like cars/bikes/boards playing music and driving by, all I really hear is the Doppler. It's come and gone so fast.. the hormones didn't get a chance to boil... What I meant up there in the last post, still speaking in generals, was this example... The noise comes and goes to fast, so one must have flash boil on thier anger settings... 

Anyway I hope you still respond to topics even though you are new and I probably scarred you unintentionally Lol.
