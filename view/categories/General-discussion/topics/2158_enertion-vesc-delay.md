Since I havent gotten a reply to the e-mail I sent a few days ago [EDIT: I received a reply a really short time before or after posting this], and because this is probably a topic that involves quite a few people I'll try my luck at a reply here. 

Hello @onloop @EnertionSupport Is the new batch of VESC's that was supposed to arrive 31st march delayed? It still says on your website that it will arrive the 31st which was some days ago. The order status is "awaiting shipment"

I've preordered 21st feb and been waiting since then, to be honest I don't really mind waiting 1 or 2 weeks more for shipping, I would just really like to know when my VESC's are going to be shipped. 

If anyone else has contacted enertion regarding this matter, your input is also very welcome :smiley:

Christ on a cracker. Maybe i should just have a hundred of my own made so that i'll never have to wait on any ever again.  

Except everything I test and use and talk about goes out of stock. I did a video on how to notch NTM shafts and then they went on backorder. I repacked a 16Ah multistar and did a test/review and now they're backordered. I got some evolve pulleys and did a video on doing caliber truck mods for them and now they're out of stock. So when i get my VESCS, i'm not even going to mention having them. To anyone.

I wonder how difficult it would be to get a mass production of VESC's from china or something.  i mean theyre publicly available...  Maybe we can do a group buy and research companys to create it....

Far fetched idea?

I think a lot of us european e-board builders would love that, since if we order 1 VESC at a time we prolly wont have to pay 25-30% tax + shipping is not crazy from China. I would definitely order 4 or more

RE raptors, waiting on carbon fiber decks!... will arrive next week. They took 20 days longer than i was told.

sorry if you didn't get this info...

RE vesc.... buying 1000 vesc has brought with it some new challenges... mostly related to suppliers not carrying enough stock....  they only way I get the price break is buying in 1000qty (eg 6000 mosfets)... so we have been talking directly with International rectifier & ST and mouser trying to make things happen.

the first batch of PCB were made wrong so they got scrapped! welcome to the world of manufacture!

if anyone wants a refund just say so.

May. This is cutting it very close to my group ride. If they don't show up before then i'll have one running personal board instead of three, which means there will be fewer people. I hope this is the final delay. I need these by mid may. 

Red PCBs means a 20% performance increase over the other colors. Good choice.

My boards are 20% faster than anything else on the market because they're red. In fact, the particular shade of red i'm using on the wood is a bleeding edge prototype red that could potentially deliver up to 21% performance increases over competition. 

I think the VESC will benefit greatly from the color upgrade.

If it's glossy red, the drag coefficient decreases, and adds 1.32-1.34% additional performance, if I remember correctly.

ugh. I was hoping to have my new 10S ready for the May ride as well as my personal Scarlet which is down with blown DRVs. Oh well, guess I'll get a couple from elsewhere to hold me over until i can get the 5 i ordered here.  At that point I'll have extras and they'll basically be on tap for a short while anyway, which will be good. Trying to see the bright side... but i'll be down to 2 boards which means only one guest rider... oh well.

just so you all know what the fuck is going on....

there are literally not enough mosfetts in the entire world to make the vesc you all want...

I personally need 12,000 of them.... yup...thats right! I just upped my order from 1000 to 2000 vesc's

there was around 4000fets (only enough to make 660vesc) available back in early march, but my deal wasn't finalised with the usa supplier & then some cheeky bastard bought them all anyway... 

see for yourselves...

This is hilarious. Our lust for esk8 perfection has upset the entire world market. 

And so it begins. Next at Channel 9 News: Local eboarders arrested with stolen car stereo amplifiers say that they acted out of distress due to a mosfet shortage. This and the weather tonight at 10.

I really don't know about stock, but this is very strange that theres short on stock for this MOSFET. This is logically strange because some companies produces electronics part like 1000 ready SMT assembled pcb per day and how they could operate if they are short in components. Not sure if they preorder those components earlier or use another supplier besides mouser, farnell, etc.

@onloop  So why do you have to produce the complete batch VESCs at once?
I don't want a refund, but if you made the first 660 VESCs straight away you could sit on your couch and drink some whiskey instead of dealing with angry people.

they currently have enough fets to make just 82 vesc, As of today I have told them they need to squeeze this into the production schedule because **my customers are completely losing their fucking minds over this product.**

the problem is normally factories have their production facility booked in advanced, they plan to make batches of parts in advance too... shit is tightly controlled.

they allocate resources to produce X amount on X date.

trying to fuck with a factories schedule does not make me a popular person!... in fact stopping their production to make 82 of something is likely to delay all their other customers who are all probably waiting for stuff too. i assure you they are not happy about this.

the plan was always to make this run in 2 batches of 500... but we have never got enough fets to start.

the due date for fets is late may. plus sometime is needed to actually assemble the vesc....


all the people wanting refunds, please be patient, you are adding several hours of paperwork to my daily list of jobs.. so thanks, i fucking hate paperwork...

this is extracted from my T&C's page...
**Product Returns & Credits can take up to 30 days to be processed.**

already got samples, already tested! everything is good!

ALSO, good news from yesterday is mouser 'found' some fetts & delivered them to my factory.... now we have enough to build 475 VESC....

looks like the schedule just got much better for us... 

this is nearly enough to cover all orders and could be shipping within 30 days.

Production schedule update.


these are shipping dates from my factory to AUS
5/20 = 100pcs
5/27 = 100pcs
6/3 = 100pcs

they need to ship them to Australia & we need to install the wires, capacitors & do firmware loading.....

then we need to ship them back to US for distribution...

this is a huge waste of money & resources! & extremely bad for the environment!

but it will speed things up by about 2 or 3 weeks... so all the people who are urgently needing their vesc will have it sooner than expected.....

oldest orders get filled first!

@clpjan delays like this are somewhat common in the world of DIY preordering. I believe that you'll get your VESC from Enertion as soon as soon as they are available. In any case, there is no one else with VESC in stock at the moment, so there is no way to get one faster than holding tight until they are ready to ship. If you poke around on the forums here you'll see many similar questions about delayed orders for various DIY vendors. Enertion is reliable. I got my VESC from Enertion and it was similarly delayed but it arrived to me as soon as manufacturing was complete.

Watch this video ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RAA4Z2vs7iw ) from @onloop (enertion) he explains alot about the VESC, delays etc. The supplier won't be finished with the VESCs until 16th of may due to mosfets beeing hard to get, and that is when they **should** be manufactured. It'll take a couple of more weeks for you to recieve them. Enertion is doing everything they can so be patient!

@clpjan as far as I know he makes them by hand so when you order it will be built..although I do think @chaka said he would be pre-making them. He's probably the person to ask.

I payed for a VESC in March by using PayPal and i filed a dispute through PayPal and have yet to get a reply on there. This dispute was filed before I found out what happened to this batch of VESC. I searched on the forum and thats how i was informed. Now i feel bad that i filed that dispute because i wasn't informed but would it best for me to not excalate and just wait a bit longer for the vesc problem to be resolved. I know its not his fault.

Hes employing a business manager to deal with the background stuff.  The guys working from his garage FCS.  Give him a break. They are excuses,  but hes saying he cant control it and the vids are the easiest way he feels to get info out.  Also you see him.  Do wonder whether Vlogs is another distraction for him though.  But its all about management of time and resources. He wouldnt have that much cash flow given the hold up with parts.

That's great that he is doing vlogs but I feel like that's another distraction for him like @Dedbny said.  His vlogs for the most part are not updates about things.  It's more so his personal family life and what he is doing... Like "hot date with with my wife's best friend".  I watch his vlogs because he said to look for updates there but mostly it's his daily life, whisky drinking, etc.  I do like them when there is E-board related material on there, but not when he is at a BBQ doing something else.  He just bought a gorilla pod.  He is setting up camera for shots that he walks into.  It's starting to look a lot like Casey neistat is.  And that is fine.  But the reason I subscribed is for electric skateboard related material.

I feel like he is spending a lot of time on those to shoot and to edit, he can be using that time on his business and to provide better customer service.  He said he is too busy to give minor updates regarding order statuses, it sure doesn't seem like he is that busy given the amount of time he is putting into vlogs.  I'm a firm believer of putting in the most time to keep customers happy and to deliver the best products with awesome QA.  That's where most of his time should go.  The vlogs about sharing his day to day life are meh, does anyone else watch the vlogs to genuinely see what his daily life is like?

Hard for me to try to influence how another man spends his time. Although I do think a good portion of his day goes to the vlog (when he does one, they're not always daily), it is nowhere near as robust as Casey's. Not to go off tangent but in general that vlogging style is pretty much just a standard (now), it was nothing new in terms of film techniques, just something people never really wanted to put any time to doing because they probably didn't think it was necessary...until someone got popular for doing it well. 

Anyways, the "date with wife's best friend" video did/does have a disclaimer that it does not have any electric skateboards involved. Also, looking at his youtube history it was probably the first video that did not have to do with eboards at all....he doesn't always have something new to share or work every single day. Seems like the first time he had gotten to do something fun in a while and he decided to record it.

Don't get me wrong, I do believe more time should be put into  customer service. That's exactly why he just hired a business manager to help him do all of that, he admitted in a vlog that he's weak in that area. Hopefully this new guy is as good as he says and can keep customers updated on here / make things move a long faster. Don't know what Jason has planned for QA, but that definitely should be his priorirty as it hurts his brand when someone gets something poorly put together. I watch his vlogs with the hope of seeing a vesc shipment in one lol but I stick around for the other stuff too occasionally if its not too boring.

I would like to introduce you to Rose, she is a beautiful custom designed JIG designed for loading firmware onto VESC & Spinning Up motors in one fell swoop, She can do 10 VESC each go!

Rose is one of those girls who you can't live with & you can't live without.... She is one of the biggest headaches in getting my large VESC batch made - she is complex and has been hard to manage..... When manufacturing in qty of 2000 VESC it is no longer feasible to touch each vesc & program them. You need to automate as much as possible....

Problem with Rose is she is a hardware & software solution, she needed to be developed from the ground up & she is well overdue....

FUCK YOU ROSE.....

The good news is she is due to be completed in 7 days, then finally we can get the output of VESC up to a respectable level. At the moment things have come to a grinding halt....

I too am unsure about what is actually in stock with Enertion since it all shows that just about everything is available for order. I am waiting on confirmation that my order for a pulley and belt set is actually in stock. 

I would expect (and hope) that Jason will be looking to actively monitor stock on the website now that he has so much traffic coming through. Perhaps an upgrade is needed in order to automatically switch it's status to back order when sold out?

I messaged them on Facebook, I asked them when my VESC that I ordered a few days ago would be shipped, they said next month, I  believe middle or late, but who knows, shit can happen. They said their pulleys (12mm) were out of stock, and would be in stock a gain next week (so roughly 5 or 6 days from now depending where you are from). They didn't say their motor mounts were in stock, but they didn't say they weren't, so I'm just gonna assume it's in stock.

we are sandboxing a new inventory management system, it will help us with most of the problems we are facing at the moment.

it will also help us with forecasting for our purchasing to prevent out of stock situations.

AS the business is now starting to mature (slightly) and our cash flow is improving we will likely disable the ability to order out of stock items... However as a new & growing business we needed to offer presales on some items to help us raise the funds to buy the goods....

If we don't pre-sell stuff we are forced to order in very small quanitiy, or speculate, which makes our cost of goods much higher and often makes the deal less desirable.

To secure good prices we need large qty orders, therefore we must pre-sell some items..

However, most of the "out-of-stock" items at the moment are due to unexpected growth.

Lots of stock due to arrive in the next two weeks.... it's like the silence before the storm... glad i have my team in place now.

Please put item count for each of your products, so that everyone can see if the item is in stock and how many items is left.

it is our mission to have everything instock....

if we can't achieve that we will be forced to make some tough decisions, at the moment trying to keep the CF deck in stock is a major issue. We can't easily scale production without more molds...  they are expensive & very concrete... they prevent us from being agile.

so for now, additional molds are not something we are factoring into the equation..... carbon fiber decks are beautiful and offer some awesome benefits but we are not sure they are the best solution, we will keep testing the carbon & wood options.

Once we have enough results to make a calculated decision we will commit to one or the other or just keep innovating...

we are very cautious about being static in a highly dynamic & rapidly growing industry.

"Please be advised lead times for this product are now currently at 3-4 weeks". Or something of that nature? It would inform the customer to a reasonable level and allow them to make the call.

From what I've gathered from his last vlog the VESC's that need to be shipped to a US address could be on track. However, those headed for Europe and the rest of the world would have been too expensive to be shipped from the US so they shipped those in a big box to Enertion HQ and will be shipped from there.

This might be why they are not giving any order number progression.

This picture on the product page says it is "IN STOCK" and "Immediate Shipping" but when you look closely it says "*from 30/6/16" in small font. Kind of slimey if you ask me. Especially since both of those claims don't seem to be true. Enertion does not have vescs and he is not shipping immediatly. Not to mention I contacted enertion support to get a realistic time estimate, and they did not respond.
I have ordered from plenty of small companies for numerous hobbies, (Including R/C cars, planes, quadcopters, tricopters, trials bikes, Vintage moped performance parts, yoyos etc.) and have never had this kind of experience.

You could cut off the excess wire a bit from the CapPCB pos/neg wires seems like they stick out quite a bit and I'd separate heatshrink both so that way they aren't touching.

We are using 63Volt caps in our VESCs as well since it's  Vedders recommendation and it gives some headroom. 

It might be ok with lower voltage configurations, but I'd definitely not use 50V caps on a 50,4V (12s) setup. And voltage spikes can also happen frequently. 

Only my 2cts...

Well i think it was not a good decision to change the caps because 50V were in stock. Onloop noted on the sales page that it will be 63V not 50V... So he will get much hazzle with the customer service

I agree, I've been patiently waiting and was fine with all the delays, I totally understand the growing pains and waiting on manufactures etc.
But it doesn't feel good to have my patience rewarded whith changing the product specs, so now I won't get what I thought I ordered.
I'm sure Jason will fix this eventually, but in the meantime I need a VESC with Vedder's recommended specs. Had to cancel my order.

PS: I would like to say that I've been very happy with Enertion products an customer service for everything else I've purchased and I realize the VESC is a especially difficult thing to manufacture

I wouldn't run it with 50v caps. Per Jason's suggestion, buy some matching caps locally and send him the bill.

I see. Ok well before I do that, I'd like a confirmation from Jason @onloop @EnertionSupport that he will compensate for the matching caps. I only have one VESC that has the 50V 3300uf so shouldn't be that tedious to replace it. thanks

Why not run 50v caps at 10S? It will only go to max 42v? 12S is a different story.

I'm weary to run it in the first place since it's not up to Vedder's spec. The only reason I'm putting up with my 50v single caps is because I'll be using them in a 6s setup.

Anyone know if these are out of stock again?  I ordered 3 VESCs four days ago and my order still shows 'Awaiting Fulfillment'.  But website still says 'In stock ready to ship'.  
Emailed customer support and only get useless messages like 
'Rest assured, we are striving hard to resolve your issues and I will be definitely in contact with you over the next few days to take care of this'
Looks like an amazing ESC and like everyone else I am dying to try it!

@jeffnyc in my experience the website is not accurate. enertion is not entirely communicative about what exactly their stock situation is at this moment but the last thing I read from Jason was that most orders should ship before end of august. I ordered a single vesc back in early July. Welcome to the wait-party.

Hi guys, please be patient, imagine you opening a shop and half of the town comes in and buys you out... I've waited about 3 months for the first enertion order. Other ones were completed within 3 weeks. 
He should have an infinite supply of vescs by now. It's just a matter of packing and shipping. But I heard he lost 2/4 employees, so this is causing some delays again...

Edit: remember this is still a niche market!

Just asked a few questions expecting it to be some kind of AI but seemed to answer the question whether the vescs would ship from the EU fairly accurately. Said it would either come from China, US or Australia.
When asked if there was a warehouse in Belgium yet he replied not yet.

You can go with a lot of other VESCs and people who sell them, but the past has shown "you get what you paid for".

We have just setup 2 new warehouses/distributors Us, eu & also aus. It's a long and slow and technical  process.

There have been a few teething issues that are preventing the systems from working in harmony and syncing correctly.

We will make contact with you soon so we can better understand what happened. 

Thanks in advance.

Every single VESC we sell have a [motor spin test](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9kbYnCEkjw) done before shipping, if there are faults that occur later it is due manufacturing faults or user error, our [vesc platinum warranty](http://www.enertionboards.com/electric-skateboard-parts/1yr-vesc-replacement-warranty/) covers both so you can get an instant replacement. 

We are working on improving the production process to include more testing process to detect errors that might occur under higher currents.

Thanks,

I can obviously see and possibly fix the VESC (I would rather not have to ship this back, I have already paid something like Â£25 customs & duty), but I'm not sure if it has damaged other parts of the VESC.
If I try to remove the bridge will this void my warranty?

Or, if I buy the platinum warranty, do you want me to return the faulty unit & will I get charged customs duty again? 
Doing this platinum warranty route, if I'd have to pay for postage to Australia, and possibly duty again, it would put the total cost for the single VESC delivered (inc tax) at something around Â£190?!?

To be honest, I'm not too happy with these options, either one will cost me a lot more than I was willing to pay.

Perhaps these are being load tested without the power leads/motor leads attached - which is why my fault would have slipped through as it's a problem that came from the power cables being soldered off-target.

email support with details of your issues, if you have and instant replacement warranty & we don't have any more of the old vesc you get a VESCX instead - just need to wait for the production line to ramp up.

Thanks for all your help. I did email today but they directed me to the link for the Standard VESC and to use a coupon code. But the Standard VESC said out of stock so I emailed back saying that earlier today but got no response. It would just be helpful if I had a clear response. If I have to wait for the VESC-X to ramp up that's fine, I'd just like something more concrete.

No problem! When you decide what to do let me know so I can officially place a replacement order, if that's possible :D. Thanks for your help
