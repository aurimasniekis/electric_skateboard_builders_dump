Just had word from one of my suppliers that ABEC11 have closed down the company.

@psychotiller you know Chris right? Is this real or am I getting dis-information?

Although this might just be the FAKE news media.

definitely not "fake news media", but I could be getting wrong info from the supplier which is why I asked mr tiller if he knows anything

Haven't we been through this before thinking they closed? Then they came out with reflys.

nope, never had a wholesaler tell me they were closed, same supplier has mentioned it's hard for them to get stock in the past, but not the company has closed

This is starting to sound like a good business move ðŸ˜‚

He might rename the brand "closing down, everything must go" and then just keep it open for 30 years

I hope not...their precision trucks are my favorite to ride. But I wouldn't be surprised if some restructuring occurs on their end...and that means they could be out of business for a while.

I agree with you there trucks are great.  If they do there will be a lot of companies looking for replacement wheels.  Sk8trip distribution is the company that owns JET and Abec 11 there website is still up.  I dont think they would close down and completely go out of business but definitely could see a restructure or re-branding happening

this is sad news indeed. Fortunately for me I have 2x spare sets which will probably out last my skating days anyway (perhaps part of the problem) but I feel for those who've yet to ride on 107s, and now may never get their hands on a fresh set once the existing stock is sold out :(

I love my abecs.  
Been riding on gumballs for years. 
Would definitely be disappointed to lose access to abec wheels.

From everything I know, this is not the end, the perfect storm that the parties are involved in will come to an end and they will survive, then thrive.  I think @DavidBanner term "Phoenixing" is appropriate here.

I make Sixshooters with my hands using Abec's CNC mill. And I made them before I started using the mill there. There is no end in sight to the pneumatic torment I will cause.

The eRumor mill is alive and well. My guess is somebody just bought a huge lot of sub par kegel cored wheels rapped in shitty urethane that they will soon try to run a parallel hype campaign right next to this thread.

Adding to the rumor mill:

I heard that they started thinking about adding heatsinks to trucks and the sound of an angry army of winged Australian lawyers was heard in the distance. They closed down in fear for their lives. RIP.

Yeah I guess I missed the part were peeps were hating on Abec, can you link that for me. It's funny you forget that I used to be the only one around here urging people to use Abec instead of those crappy clone wheels. 

Good to know you were just "joking". Good one bro. You do have to admit it sounded an awful lot like your honest opinion. Labeda makes good thane and aend does too. You might be surprised that some wheel companies use both factories. No sense in bashing either one!
