So I need a new damn phone. Mine is fucking dying and I want to hear what you turds are using. 

I need something that will work with the @Ackmaniac app.  So no Iphone.


I am coming from an Android S8 Active.  I like it a lot except the dumb ass Bixby button which I only ever hit unintentionally.

Tough as fucking nails with no case and waterproof.  I like that. 

But to my chagrin, they don't have the new ones in an "Active" model.


So, what the fuck do I get?

@dareno If you like paying more money to have less freedom and a crappier phone and getting completely butt-fucked by a corporation that doesn't give any shits about you at all, then sure, get a fruity phone.  They are actively working as hard as possible to make sure China gets all the newest software faster and cheaper and can innovate more quickly than the west can.  If you support that, then you should definitely overpay for a crappy fruit phone.

Samsung s10+ (don't scoff, I was coming off an S7)

I love it. My hand doesn't reach the top of the screen though so I kinda wish I got the s10 and not the plus. 5'10" for reference.

For more budget, s9 or s9+

Yeah the note issue and folding issues are bullshit. 

My problem with Samsung has been consistent:

They try to spread into too many new areas and stretch themselves too thin to be the "first" at stuff.

Their S series flagships have been solid for me and many others though.

I don't know what price range you're looking at. For the middle range, Nokia and Motorola aren't bad. I personally went for Xiaomi and installed a custom rom because I don't trust them that much, but their pricing is just so good.

Google is going to announce their new pixel 3a which should be fairly priced.

Not bad. I had a Nexus 5 for 2.5 years, fell a few times, but it was still running fine. Battery was starting to show some weakness but that's to be expected.

I would, maybe, wait a few months to see how the new Pixel 3a is doing though, some previous pixel models had nasty problems...

I've never used an Apple product in my life and honestly probably never will.

Except, scratch that now I guess - the new power beats or whatever, despite their being overpriced as fuck, do unfortunately tick every box (except sound quality) I need for IEM's for working out/actual work. I always lived a life of saying I'd never touch anything by Dre's bitch ass, but the market is making me haha.

Anyways, Samsung is just REALLY shit at phones man. If you don't believe so, I can't make you. Oneplus was good in the beginning... Now they're not. Motorola has pissed me off one too many times after my experience with the Moto x pure. 

Nokia really just has some bomb diggity shit goin on right now. Also, if you don't mind not having a 3.5mm jack, there are plenty of great options. I however will keep one until I no longer can. By that time, I'll hopefully be dead or something


You and your ooh I just found an apple fanboy ass :stuck_out_tongue:

samsung is doing a deal on trade ins right now. you get a really good deal on your previous phone. And you can get $350 towards a new phone. id say go for the s10e its honsetly the perfect size and if you can trade in your s8 active and get the s10e for $400. you cant beat it.

I recently got the pixel 3 when they were half off. Pretty solid so far but I do miss the headphone jack and a lot of Samsung features that were just more convenient. I'm a longtime Samsung note user and mine broke so I got something cheap to hold me over until the 10. I'm a dongle none charging with my iems user for now.

You're missing the point that no respectable smartphone enthusiast could ever buy a phone from what was supposed to be the 'flagship killer' now selling... flagships.

Yes, oneplus has great phones. We have a oneplus 3 and x in our family I believe, got both when they came out and haven't had many issues. Motorola also has decent phones, especially for the average consumer. At this point, it's about fuck the company as a whole for both brands for all of the shit they've pulled, not fuck 'insert this nice hardware and less bloated version of Android flagship here'

Also, the OnePlus 6 camera is surprisingly bad for the price range tbh.

That's why anyone with exiperence would downLoad Google's camera app instead of using the one OnePlus provides.

One plus is still a flagship skiller

For example my one plus 6 (snapdragon 845, 256gb storage, 8gb ram) competes with the s9 at half the price

I'm going to try to say "not really", however I currently only have my phone and not a triple monitor setup to easily compare.

I do know the camera from my 2015 Moto is near better than the OnePlus 6, also that the OnePlus 7 will use a vastly different camera than the 6/6t.

Also pretty sure the xiaomi/Huawei flagships are using way different stuff.

I'm not really trying to argue with you. All of the big names in phones are definitely good enough for the average user, else they wouldn't be being mass produced. Near anybody seriously in to tech can tell you with good sources that Samsung is really shitting itself in the phone side of things. They are however like 1/4 of SK's GDP so they do a lot of shit well (maybe...)

I just personally don't like Samsung, have had shitty experiences with Moto repeatedly, and can't respect OnePlus and don't like most of their new offerings. 

Nokia ticked all of my boxes for the time being for a completely mid range phone. For the $250 I paid, I really don't think the 7.1 can be beat. 

I'm hoping in the future I see some flagship offerings that have what I'm after as well.

As a matter of fact, there is one thing that really kinda sucks about the Nokia for me. Single speaker is bottom firing on the right when looking at the phone. The way I rest it on my forearm in bed completely blocks the port and sound is diminished by 95% and vibrates the shit out of the casing.

the flagship phones are s10+, note 9 and p30 pro all around $900 new

If you want something cheaper i suggest the a8 a9 a80 a90 which are new mid range smartphones from samsung $4-600

Or if you want quality but reasonable priced that does everything id say go for an s9+ for around $450-500 (this is not much of an upgrade from the s7 or s8 apart from the screen) But if you want the biggest battery, biggest screen and slightly improved camera it will cost you top dollar!

I am hearing about phones I didn't even know existed unless it is from the S-series Note series, iphone or the pixel I haven't heard of it.  My wife just ordered some screen protectors for her cowork who has the J7 Star??? I asked her what the shit is that.  Really all these phones are the same if they are android unless it is an iphone.  Only thing different is a few features like better camera maybe slightly better processor. But I say stick with those a S-series or pixel and you will have the best phone to run the Ackmaniac app.  I personally have an iphone and love it but realize just anyone cant upload a app to the app store which I do appreciate because helps weed out the virus packed bloatware apps.  

If your going for the hipster look, like I said before the motorola Razer or the LG EN2

The ultra wide lens is insane. Instead of digitally stretching and distorting pixels, it has a physical lens for a true zoom without distortion. It's lightning fast, battery is rock solid. In display fingerprint is crazy fluid. The front camera hole is not annoying.

Stupid 99% of the time but could be useful one day:

I can wirelessly charge other phones/devices with my phone!  I charged up my maytech R2V2 remote at the park recently. 

Plus the opal white version is unbelievably sexy :+1:

I can't personally say. I upgraded from the S7 so either would be a huge step up for me. Logically I would say no: the s9 is still a great phone as long as you get it new. The battery's death will be the phone's death.

Throwing in a vote for the [Pocophone F1](https://www.poco.net/global/) from Xiaomi. 

Picked it up on day one (one of the few people who bought it in under 5 minutes before they sold out completely), and I have loved it since.

Comes with all of the flagship features:
* Snapdragon 845 processor
* 6GB of RAM
* 64GB (+ expansion) ROM
* Good screen to body ratio (there's a notch, but I never notice it anymore)
* 4000mAh battery
* Mostly stock android (they have a few Xiaomi apps, but its nothing crazy)
* Water cooling (if that's even a feature that matters haha)
* Good camera's for all the pictures of your Boards 'n Beer

Most importantly:
* A HEADPHONE JACK!!!
* Inexpensive at around $250-300

Only cons I personally have:
* Not waterproof (not super huge for me, but I know you mentioned you prefer it),
* Gorilla glass could be improved to a newer model (not huge for me, but it could make or break it for some people)
* Some of the GSM bands aren't 100% supported so cell-service may be limited in some areas
* Netflix had a problem on the HD content

i've been using a LG V20 for a couple years now.  it's an older model.  but it's the very last android phone that has a swappable battery.

it doesn't have water proofing, or face recognition, or whatever incremental improvements current model phones have.

it is liberating to have extra batteries and just swap them out when it runs out of juice.  i haven't known charge anxiety for years now.

It has a good resolution, is snappy and has more cores than my pc. 

In addition to that it has FLIR Camera, air quality sensors, laser for measuring short distances, dual sim or sd-card.

For me that's enough. I admit, I can be clumsy at times.
I had a Pixel for one week, till it rained into my pocket, had an s6 till it fell down and a z3 (damn smooth surface) before it slid off the table. 
Everytime when this one fell down I still smiled, picked it up and went on. Of course I had to get used to the thickness, but the biggest relief was the not being anxious about that piece of hardware anymore.

It won't cost you 1k buck and it rocks. There's a compact version should you prefer a "reasonably small" powerhouse instead of the usual rectangular slate everyone carries. Just my 2 cents.

Basically is is an S + with a stylus and a few hardware changes. Usually they have a little better camera, more ram etc. 

The big difference however is the stylus and what you can do with it. Some people use it for a week then forget about it some others like myself have integrated it into our routine and it has become indispensable.

I use it to take notes on the fly, draw work related stuff, sign pdf documents etc. There are literally a million things you can do with it.

Also they are supported for a lot longer compared to other models. I got my Note 8 with Android 7 and now it has 9 with a lot of added interesting features incorporated into one ui.

Pixel 2 XL here. Switched from iPhone 6, would not recommend it at launch but I followed it closely after and it seems they fixed the issues. Sometimes it needs to be rebooted to have calls and texts go through, maybe once every 2 months. Fingerprint scanner is not as consistent but that could just be scratching my fingers from grip-tape.

I recently compared a 2 xl to a 3 and liked the feel of it. 

I refuse to switch back until iPhone's have usb-c, the lightning cable with usb-c macbook is a fucking stupid design choice.

If you eat baby seal meat, it doesn't mean you had no part in the killing-baby-seal process, despite you not personally killing it.

You have a choice, it's just not important enough to you for your own country to succeed.

With Google Fi activation and trade-in, you can get them for $200-ish or so.

Even has a headphone jack. :)

Yes. I chose not to repeat teaching them how to use skype, google photos. WhatsApp, etc in two Chinese languages to a 67, 75, 78 & 82 year old. They say you can’t teach an old dog new tricks. Have you ever tried to teach an dying alien anything in three languages. I’ve tried 3 years? It’s much worst. 

You have this thing about doing everything for your own sanity and suggest others to do the same such as not being a hobby, not driving a fossil fueled death machine and riding in something like a hurricane. But I and many normal people live a different path than you. I carry two phones and they do everything I’ve asked of them. If I can chose to have younger parents, in-laws and other relative that actually spoke English that would be great!

I love my s8 still a great phone. I perfer my s5 though because the built on IR I could do a lot of fun hacky shit.  Probably why they took that out of the new models. The DMV hated when I would change the channel lol

What's the point of a cell phone if you can't watch porn on the go. That screen in too small.

Still rocking the iphone 6s.  3.5mm jack and home button, will also fit in pants pocket.

Most importantly it is shrouded in a Lifeproof case (completely saved my hand when i broke my knee last year, case has scar to prove it).  The phone itself has been out of the case for maybe 2hrs since purchased new.  The thing looks brand spanking new, not a single scratch, not even on the backside from fidget spinning on a table.

Moral is what ever phone you do get, be sure to flip some coin for a good-great case.

Thank you “Lifeproof”

Is that a trophy case of your old phones? And I see a Razr by far the coolest phone of the early 2000's.  I remember the hot pink version that all the girls in my school had as they walked with there VS Pink tote bags.  Definitely the rendition of the basic white girl.  And from what I read a few days ago they are looking at redoing the Razr but as a foldable smartphone.

yup. It's most of the old phones that my wife and I used to have. The Zach Morris phone was my dad's. I sold GSM phones back in the early 2000s. I still have a StarTAC which is what the RAZR was modeled after

I was mugged of the StarTAC in Dublin city back in the 90s, think a Nokia followed it, kinda liked the flip it was cool for the times
