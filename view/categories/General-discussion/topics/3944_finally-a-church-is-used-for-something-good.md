Holy balls! That is amazing. Finally a place for all the godless heathens (well, some, not all). Lol. I bet the original designer never saw that coming. And what a cool vantage point from the balcony to watch the ramp riders. It's not over until the fat lady is drawn naked in brick inside a church. (I think I got that saying right.)
