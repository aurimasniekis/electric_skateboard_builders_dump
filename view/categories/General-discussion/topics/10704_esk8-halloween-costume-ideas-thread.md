Not at all. Think about it, every custom anyone wears has been done by someone else before...

So it really doesn't matter that it's been done.

But if you want to be original, then keep thinking... There has to be another one that hasn't been done on an eboard...

I know some people have done this with those silly self balancing boards, but not on a longboard:

haha i do have a dragonball costume, so it should be very easy to wrap some wadding around my Simba Board :smiley: 

also a nice idea would be to transform a board into a pet or something which follows you around and you could hopp on it. eeeeehm like a crocodile? :D

I met jesse (Aladdin) at the beach a couple weeks ago, he was trippin out when I told him I built my board.  at the time I was testing purple kegels so it accelerated like a beast, even compared to the brand new v2 boosted.

Not much of a costume but still pretty awesome!

These are nice costumes and the theme is cool. My sister studies in high school and they have a theme of 'hospitals'. We bought medical uniforms after someone suggested us to [shop online](http://www.salusuniforms.com/Print-V-neck-Scrubs-C11.aspx) stores and we are not able to find local stores for accessories. Any help will be appreciated in case of online stores.

Always wanted to put a ring of fire arround the board and go sneaking behind people and activate the fire, together with some scary costume

Last year I made a fire breathing pumpkin but the result was pretty lame since the bathroom spray I used would spit fire very far, this year Iâ€™m using wd-40 and will be much cooler (or hotter)

Maybe strap two WD cans to the side of the board activated via two servos

I think this would look cool flying down the road at night.  The wings expand when you pull the cord.  Not sure how safe the mask would be though.  Don't be stealing my idea either
