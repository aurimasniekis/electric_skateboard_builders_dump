For those that asked for the same range of pulleys for the flywheel and clones for 3D printing here they are. 
I dont own/have access to flywheels or clones at the moment so these 34-40 I can guarantee will fit. The mating portion is an exact replica of the original file, just used my own source files for the pulleys. 42 and 44 are larger but from measurements on here they should fit just fine. 42 and 44 have that extra top lip because teeth were larger than mating portion. Thats the only difference, should still work though. If someone wants to bite the bullet and print one of the 42 or 44 and confirm they're okay or let me know if there are any issues I can fix it should that be the case. These are all bolt and nut versions since they seem to be preferred over bolting right into plastic. If enough people want the nut free version then I'll do them later.

Here are the links. Enjoys.

I must say, I don't like just straight up copying from someone else's work but I didn't really have any choice here. So it made it a little easier. I would have rathered had a wheel and measured, printed and revised because modelling for so thing I've never seen in person is particularly hard. But made sure to give credit where credit is due.

```
@Chris_KP I didn't draw the teeth on most of these. Only the 42 because it's not a commercially available model. B&B Manufacturing has solidworks models of a full range of HTD and others. But for the 42 tooth pulley you open up any model and start a sketch on the flat face of the pulley then select the existing geometry of one tooth, from peak to peak. Then you start a new part and past the tooth profile. Set it up so it's concentric to the origin of the drawing and circular pattern it 42 times. Then you must make sure the arc length between 2 teeth is 5mm so it's HTD5. Then once that's done you create a circle that joins up the teeth and that's about it. Extruded it to about 20mm and make a blank of the pulley and then just combine the two solids to create the full assembly. If you dimension stuff relative to the right features, creating a 12mm pulley from a 15 mm becomes a matter of just changing one dimension and everything else with adjust itself accordingly.  But that's how you make it.

Thanks man!, I would make the outer edge higher for the belt to stay on better on the smaller ones. Just like the orangetangs I've seen passing by. So if you would not like the edge, you start printing with an offset of 2mm. Then you have both options available

Hey @Skitzor , the outer edge dimensions are identical to the Orangatangs.  As someone else mentioned before, these edges are more of a safeguard, the motor pulley is the one that determines the tracking of the belt.

very good, I was looking for that, going to print the 44t and test them with the MBS-all-terrain wheels.

So if I'm not mistaken the wheels are 100mm in diameter and the 50T pulley would be 80mm so that leaves 10mm clearance, 48 is 76.5 mm and so leaves ~12mm clearance. I'll make both but just so you're aware of the size it'll be.

Thanks **a lot** for the STLs, I will definately try one soon!

Maybe this can help you to create the base gear: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:16627/#files

There's an SCAD file that can create the pulleys programmatically or you can use the customizer.
You can hit <open in customizer> and select HDT5 (set profile to `10`), teeth to 40, 48, 50 or whichever you want and then create things > download STL.

Maybe you knew it already or you have a better way to make them otherwise you can try that.
Thanks again!

The only issue with this is the download is an STL file that I think have to manipulate into a solidworks file to be able to use and in doing so can't guarantee the level of quality of the gear.  I usually download a solidworks file directly from a manufacturer and the feature resolution is much better. For gears I can't find i do have a profile of 1 HTD5 tooth and I can create any sized gear I want by hand if need be, again with much better resolution than getting the STL and converting. But thank you for trying to help me out anyways!

Can you recommend the cheapest 3D Printing service, Shapeways is gong to run me over $50/pulley before shipping.  This is unfamiliar space for me, so need full service printing shop.  I think I saw another thread on this, so will check that as well, but right now price checking the 44T 15mm wheel pulleys and thin retainer for cheapest options.  Also just tell me if this is the reasonable pricing regardless lol.  Thanks!

That sounds right, I only ordered one set of 44T pulley + thin retainer, not the pair you ordered. Want to see how it comes out first lol. 

In separate esk8 thread they are using 12-14mm spacer for these type of ABEC wheel pulleys when installing on a 107mm wheel. Are there similar spacer files we can use in addition to retainer here in order to fit depth of 107mm centerset wheel?

Good lord you guys are paying >$50 for 3d printed pulleys???  That's insane.  Making those pulleys costs nothing near that.

Shapeways is most definitely not the cheapest 3d printing service.  I can do It for you guys if you'd like, just send me a pm.  I would say they would come out to 5-8 dollars

I think I replied to you on a different thread, but doing it again on this thread.

The shapeways 3D printed parts are printed in Nylon using sintering. That makes it super strong and doesn't de-layer like the extrusion printing. $35(shipped) is probably not too bad if it lasts more than twice that long.
```

Yea, it wouldn't last any longer.  I print them In 100% infill and I've probably put 150-200 km on my 30T pulley and it shows zero sign of wear whatsoever.  The board is going to blow up before my pulleys break

Edit - I shouldn't knock sintering, its great, but the difference in strength is not enough to make a difference with how we use these pulleys.  They just don't see the forces necessarily to break them as long as they are printed correctly

Also I keep hearing about this 107 flywheel that you need spacers for.  If someone could provide me with the dimensions for these and a few pictures of how the current model fits, I can just makes all these for the 107 and save you the trouble of shimming them. Up to you guys though.

I should note that I didn't have time to closely look at the teeth, but they are no bueno.  (44t version)

I tried printing with 1,2 and 3 walls and different infills and they still wind up very strange.  I can PM you a picture, but in general they seem to be too thin and there is space between the infill and teeth.  I changed the infill overlap and it didn't do much.  My guess is that the flat part on the top is still not big enough.  I tried it with both printers, one with .5mm nozzle and another with .4mm and neither could print the teeth correctly.  The original thingiverse teeth work great though, so I would assume the other pulleys that are duplicates would work.

Awesome, I saw them show up on thingverse a few hours ago and downloaded it thanks. I also see you popped up in the 107mm pulley thread volunteering help. What can I do to get you the information that will enable you to modify for the deeper centerset 107mm wheel hub?  I can take pictures from all angles and measure anything you need but I don't have a caliper so not sure how precise dimensions need to be?  Really need to find a way to make this work, will even mail you a 107mm wheel of that is the way to get it done!  Thanks.

Can you DM picks so I can see what you're referring  to. Are you saying the teeth on the pulley itself are too thin? I will double check that as soon as I'm into work in the morning but the tooth profile is the exact same as the 36 tooth. What's your infill settings. I've printed my (36t) at 100% infill and 2mm wall thickness and I've yet to have a failed print.

@Genex and I are having our own private discussion about his prints but just wanted to confirm for the rest of you the STL files are fine. I printed the pulley portions from the 44T file just to see if I could replicate the results that were brought forward which were issues with the teeth , but I didn't have issues. Here's the tooth profiles, printed with a .5mm nozzle at .2mm layer height, outerwalls at 25mm/s, inner walls at 35mm/s and infill at 55mm/s.

```
Usually around 235-240 extruder temp, bed temp is basically as hot as you can make it.  If you are printing a larger piece you are going to need it as hot as you can get.  Smaller parts you can suffice with around 80C, but bigger parts require a lot of heat to prevent the warping you are seeing. 

If you can't get good bed adhesion you can use hairspray in a thin film on the platform to help.  

Do NOT use your cooling fan, just like with ABS.

If you are having problems with adhesion on the 40T I would try laying a pretty decent layer of hairspray where it is going to be printed, specifically around the edges.  Apply it when the bed is cool

As for speed, you aren't going to want to print as fast as you do with ABS/PLA.  Slow it down a bit.  Not as much as you would with TPU (flexibles) but slower than abs/pla

[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8XaUfVZEP4)

Here is a video of a guy printing petg with a bed temp of 45, which imo is low, but it seems to work for him.  He shows his settings at about 2:30.  He is using blue tape, so if you don't have any kind of bed adhesion tools like buildtak or kapton tape, use some blue painters tape and level the bed.  Offers a pretty good adhesion layer, especially better than glass or aluminum.

We print at 240 and heated bed at 80 for small prints and 100-115 for large (10"*10") prints. We also print onto Kapton tape. Only time we've had warping issues is one time I meant to set the print bed to 100 and did 10 instead.

The mating portion of the pulleys was only available in one stud thickness, because again that portion is not my design. The original pulley was labeled thick which I understand to mean for the thick version of the hub. So all the pulleys will fit thick hubbed  clones and from my understanding Abec flywheels as well because those are thin hubbed so there's more room in between the spokes. 

The Retainer. It came as a thin or thick option. Now, I don't know if that still reference to the fitment relative to the hub spokes or the thickness of the Retainer itself. The Thick Retainer is actually thicker than the thin Retainer, in terms of the thickness of the ring the bolts would rest on. But the Retainer I did not remodel but did confirm that the Retainer studs are equivalent to the same size as the pulley'so studs as well. 

Why they would name the thickness of the Retainer in the same way you differentiate between spoke fitment I'm not certain but that's how the original one was so I figured there was some logic to it and left it the same way.

umm i've used the old version before and it had both versions of the pulleys and retainers.

notice the thick and thin retainers have the holes on opposite sides.

i'm about half way on a print right now of your 42t pulley. if it doesn't fit my clones maybe i'll just send it to someone who can use it... its just pla. 4 wall .15 infill

@saul  Holy shit you're right! I open the 36T ones and both of those are just thick. The 44T has a thick AND a thin.  I didn't look that closely at the 44 after the 36 since I happened to have opened both the thick 44 version as well. Okay. So then a "Thin" version of these pulleys will be available for download for all sized by end of next week then. I'd do it this week but I've booked vacation and won't be able to come in over the weekend to do it so you're gonna have to wait a few extra days.

sounds good, i'm just trying these out for the next build and still have the original versions to use.

I printed the 42t 12mm and it does fit, but the screws end up near the middle of the holes, probably not stable.

Also I noticed you added 1mm or so gap on the inside of the pulley, plus the flange 2mm ish.. this might be a problem with 12/15mm setups, I had no space to spare with 15mm so that extra mm would push out too much.

i'll post some pictures later

Okay yes please for the pictures. The pulleys a reference than the 40 do have an extra mm in flange because the teeth were larger than the mating hub portion. If that can be removed and pushed back then that's something that can be adjusted, again modeled these without any real dimensions for the wheel itself, just modifying the file so 42-50 are untested on these. Once you upload pictures I can correct the issues on these thick versions and avoid the issue on the thin versions next week once I start them

getting that close without the actual wheel is pretty amazing....

Oh and also theres seems to be a hole in the stl that makes the outter flange not print correctly.
that cylinder is probably right against the face of the pulley, making them overlap slighly usally fixes this.

heres the gap i'm talking about. the curve section and flange should give enough spacing..., but the extra inset could be usful on 107mm.

I see what youre saying about the gap. The flange that is recessed into the teeth itself is 1.5mm so it looked like i could pull that back 1.5-2.0 mm without major concerns.  That should be an easy fix. How's the fitment otherwise? The sit flush up against the core? Does this thick version fit well in the hub?  Any other discrepancies apart from that gap?

Can you take a picture of the hole in the STL thing? I wasn't quite sure what that means.
With regards to the 107 I'm going to be making a 107 specific variant of three pulleys so we can use them with no inserts or shims.  Just a one piece print.  Is there 107 clones out there too or just the genuine Abec 11 flywheels?

A few weeks ago I printed the 40t version. The Enertion pulley fit very close, the 3d-pully had a gap and I removed some urethan from the wheel to make it fit closer. The MBS-wheel shape is a bit different than the abecs and enertion clone wheels. The Gap is not a big problem but It's not optimal. Maybe I can take a picture and messure the MBS-Wheel in the evening today.

Left Enertion fit, right the 3d with gap.

btw. the Enertion and Evolve pulleys are perfect in design, spacer in the pulley is always better and you don't need a retainer and screws at all. Bad, that they have only 32-38t.

So I got my hands on a pair of clones for another project and I printed pulleys to see how then fit with these clones.

These are the 36T, they fit basically perfect. They were a little tight to push in but it really helped center the pulley. The 34-38 shold fit like this one does.

This is the 44T.  you can see theres a gap. I measured it to be just shy of 2mm.  I was looking into why and Think I know. The 36T sits recessed in the wheel, so I added 1.5mm to the cone that extends out connecting the pulley and the mating portions. Because it's a cone though, the diameter exceeded that of the wheel's outer wall and so I think that the rim thats been extended is hitting the eurothane prematurely. This is a simple fix and I will do so today and reptrint to confirm. This extra gap can be expected on the 42-50 at the moment, will up date once its been changed and files updated.

The cone I'm talking about. The smaller 36T cone diameter measures 60.5mm but the 44T cone measures 63.2mm.

Well, my experiment with printing 48T and 50T did not go great, though this is all new territory for me!  I will post some pictures, but hard for me to make accurate measurements.  I also printed the "thick" and "thin" retainers separately to see how they sat in 107mm Abecs as well as 100mm MBS and 97mm Abecs+clones.  Fitting the retainers worked out pretty well, and sit pretty nicely flush for all wheels other than 107mm.  That said, longer prongs like the evolve and enertion wheel pulleys will help in all versions and could potentially allow use without retainer and screws if fill out screw half of prong.  Anyway, turning back to the 107mm, because of the depth of centerset and angled cone, the retainer prongs only barely reach the wheel spoke holes.  How can we get measurements to you that will allow some combination of longer prongs and deeper coned spacer to place the pulley teeth flush with the wheel exterior?  Seems like we are getting close but need a few more precise measurements or send you a 107mm wheel to model?  Thanks for any help on this!

I did get the pulleys printed as well, but the prongs do not reach the centerset hub.  As well, the pulley sits slightly proud outside of the wheel due due to slightly more angled pulley than wheel interior cone angle (if that makes any sense lol).  Take a look at these pictures, for comparison there is your pulley on the left and then a blue enertion pulley (sits low in wheel) and white pulley I tried awhile back that also has issues.  Does this help any?

If anyone is in NYC, I can hand them a 107mm wheel to model, or is there a service that does that kind of stuff (really I have no idea with this lol).

Yes, below are pictures of the enertion pulley which does engage the wheel core a little, so if longer prongs and spacer/more angled retainer it would be flush and probably work fine.  See picture of it pushed fully into core, then just sitting on core with prongs not engaged so you can see how much prong engages when pushed in.

Any of those solutions could make sense for me.  Honestly though, the 3dhubs 3D prints are only $6-8 per pulley plus delivery from Brooklyn if I don't do pickup. So cost for a failed pulley is not a huge hurdle if it takes a few swings to get it right no prob!  Or happy to give a wheel to someone that can model the 107mm, I am not sure what that entails.

I know @michaeld33 has dabbled in the solidworks.  If @caustin can get him access to the wheel, I'm positive he'd be able to model a 3D version of it since all we need is the dimensions of the eurothane and the depth leading up to the core from the backside which was provided in another thread on here. If we get that then changing my files for the 107 won't take me more than a day to do all 34-50 pulleys.  

I actually just had an idea but I'm not sure if it may work.  @caustin can you DM me a picture of the wheel with a ruler placed across the center of the back. So that the edge of the ruler would split the wheel in two halfs?   That and if you have two pieces of tape, place one on the inside face of the the back of the wheel on edge so it stands like a miniature wall of China then go ahead and place a second piece of tape or paper on the back of the wheel so it too stand like a miniature wall, this one we can call Berlin,  and then stick the two together. If you send me a picture of the angle the two make I can just import that picture into solidworks and use that as a reference for creating the cone for the back in the mean time. Those two things and I should be good.

Alright!!! So the wheel now exists!!! :D WEll, sorta kinda. It's on my computer which is good enough for our purposes. Referencing pictures @caustin provided and @sl33py's 27mm measurement from bearing to wheel brim, as well as the manufacture's page and overall dimensions I think we got it. 

I'll make one pulley first and send @caustin the STL and once we confirm it fits well then I'll go ahead on make the 107 series and publish them to thingiverse.

What pulley and belt width do you want to use for the test @caustin?

Woo hoo!! This is awesome.  I will eventually have to go with 9mm or 12mm belt width to save hangar space on an already wide wheel. Similarly eventually will go with larger tooth pulley to match wheel diameter, so in the 44 -48 -50 range. But for testing to determine fit, just pick what works best to assess fit.

Okay lets go 44T since it's a common size people seem to want. For belt width. You planning on running what? May as well make it fit your design since you're the one who's gonna test the fit.

Dont worry, that will come in due time. Once @caustin and I confirm that these fit the way they are meant, I will be making these in 36,38,40,42,44,46,48,and 50  for 9mm, 12mm and 15mm belts. So you'll have 24 pulleys to choose from.

So I just finished making the files and with the flat face adaptor for the bolts, you will need a 60-65mm M5 Bolt and Nut or a 2.25-2.5" 10-32 Bolt and Nut to mount these onto the 107 I'd say go with the longer ones to be safe. @caustin I'm just sending you the files now so let us now how they turned out when you get them back. 

This side tracked me from todays goals which was to fix the 40-50 flywheel and clone pulleys to eliminate that gap so I'll do that tomorrow instead and reprint one to confirm.

Pulley should be a direct fit for the wheel but lets not forget that the 3D model is based mainly on pictures and pictures that have measurements in them :joy:  I'm hopeful but I would not be surprised if there's some tweaking to be done. Thanks for @caustin for putting up the funds to test print these btw. I like to print everything myself and test it before anyone else may run into an issue but thats not an option in this case.

I'm not sure who would be the best choice for your zip, but don't have them print in anything more expensive than PLA.

I use PLA in 80-100% infill for all of my pulleys and not a single one has every broken, bent, cracked, anything.  ABS is very brittle as you observed compared to PLA, but it doesn't get surface smudges (small indents in plastic) as often.  That doesn't matter in our situation, so PLA is your best bet.  It will likely be much less to print as well.  Make sure when you order it, though, that you specify you want them done in at least 80% infill.  These things need to be strong, and the more infill the better.

So not 107 related but original post related. I'm going to redo all the ABEC series pullies, the thick hub version for sure since it works with both, if I have time I'll make a thin hub version as well but I go back to school in a week's time so I may not get a chance for it.  But the point is they're all being redone from scratch. Here's why.( And also this why I much rather model something from scratch myself than use someone else's work to start with.)

See the flat ring before the chamfer? it measures something around 50mm in diameter. 
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/e/ec22e1510e7d04c3929edf963a67e3135f4faa21.jpg" width="690" height="388">

You see the ring where eurothane meets core? Thats 46mm in diameter on the outside of the flat black edge.
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/6/694170a3e4367ac9430798e7dd18707fb3f142f7.jpg" width="690" height="388">

Theres roughly 7mm between that ring where the two materials meet and the face of the bearing. Perfect, the 3D models available that were used to base the pullies also have 7mm retainers relative to that flat ring it but it leaves a hug gap, and it always will because the two profiles will never match up. Because the 50mm ring will NEVER sit flush with respect to the wheel. Will it be good enough? Sure. But why are we settling for good enough? See how you can see a 3-4 mm gap at the bottom once the pulley is FULLY seated?  I dont like this..
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/6/6398632730a6829d6d8bd45d224c533130a2a8c8.jpg" width="690" height="388">

So since I had the wheel I said fuck it, lets start over the right way. So here's what a proper seated pulley should look like. Sits flush to the exterior wall.
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/6/667820b82664114c038adc19accdeb02734a84d3.jpg" width="690" height="388">
With no gapping holes at the bottom where the face will fully seat up against the same plane as the bearing. That ring you see is not actually a gap but rather a thin slit created from the interior diameter of the pulley being slightly larger than the core where the pulley sits in, like how it dips down before coming back up.
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/1/13e116e91403f440e06f172eb8896082c68d8543.jpg" width="690" height="388">
You can see the difference in the two profiles here.The left is a 40T and the right is a 36T but look at the cone and the retainer. Well, retainer is very similar, you wont notice anything there but the cone is sized the right way.
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/8/83daac20a52bde0b976c650c5973bce5a9870886.jpg" width="690" height="388">

Eurothane is squishy. Thats why it makes great wheels. What it doesnt make is a great reference plane to clamp against. Always engage your core. It's great for your posture and it's great for your pullies. A pulley that sits on the core will not be affected by the way the wheel warps under pressure while you stand on it, or ride over a curb or rock or whatever you want to ride over. It also wont be affected when you wrench down on your bolts. It will push up against the face of the core and it will sit true with respect to the axis of rotation. Maybe I'm just being really picky but a good design should account for these things. 

Enertion's pulley? It's 45.5mm in diameter. Thats a good design. 

Y'all probably dont care but this is kinda what I do for a living so it erked me. I'm done.

The answer is no. You can leave it open. Reason I put it on all my gears is because for those who want it, they just print the full file. For those who don't want it, they offset the file by 1.5mm. Now you've made one piece that can accommodate both  sides of the market.  It's just better that way.

Two questions:
Is anyone watching this over the pond keen on finding someone in Europe to print these?? I don't know enough to spec the print but I'll organise. 

And 2, I think anyone who is gonna benefit from this should add a little bonsella to the @JuniorPotato93 school fund - and I'd be happy to throw a few bob in. Who else??

I really, really, really, really, really want to pimp my daily commute with 107 wheels ;-)

I'm just realizing I can make the ABEC/clone series fit these without having to mod  your wheel, the MBS ones. I'll just keep the max diameter of the cone below 53 and ad a flange to any pulleys that have teeth larger than the 53mm diameter.  That way its the one pulley that works with 3 wheels,

Only had a quick chance to try fit and bolt in with hardware I had sitting around (bolts too long, nuts too small), so will take a closer look and pictures or video tomorrow.  But....WTF, these totally fit!  JP master pulley artist is 99% perfect I would estimate, which is good enough to run with but am sure we can tweak.  

Anyway here are a few pictures I quickly took as I bolted them on. Outside retainer first:

As for @E-Boarding  lol you must have laughed at the rubber marks on my 107mm from prior tests, inside flange probably makes sense but in taking a closer look at the htd5mm teeth and how they are side-filled around the edges that accomplishes abit as well.

have to drop into a work thing now, but will throw in my bag and to take home and can take pictures of any specifics.  Thinking a video tomorrow morning will perhaps show the tight fit that is hard to illustrate from still foto.  They were not hard to seat at all, and looks like the retainer prongs just barely touch the pulley prongs.  Looks like the angles are right, cant tell if they touch the whole way in and where they seat but closer look tomorrow  should show.  without bolting in, there is very little play at all so that says pretty close to exact!  Let me know what you want me to check and report on, I will circle back to this in a few hours later tonight (east coast time)!  Thanks again, and amazing work!

In theory this is 100% true. But theory doesn't always work, this is like that assumption in physics class where you assume friction is negligible.  Because a DIY pulley, or any pulley for that matter will never be perfect, it will have some forms of imperfections either in printing it or mounting it despite our best efforts to try and eliminate them. Which means your belt will wander. It will hit your wheel if you don't have a wheel side flange.

The fuck is up with auto-corrent on this phone. Printingredients is not a real word..

It doesn't hurt to have them. Unless you're really working with a very tight space.  These pulleys will always have an inside flange but you can print them without the outside flange if you want to reduce the width a little bit.

Alright so Looks like the max number of teeth that we can put onto the 107's at a HTD5 pitch is 58. So the 107's then will be offered from 36-58 only in the already commercially available pulley tooth counts because there's potentially a lot of pulleys to be made there and I dont have a lot of time before school. The 60T pulley would leave you with just under 1 cm of clearance. once @caustin lets us know how they perform and what not I'll get on making the series.

So, a couple of things to report and suggest.

Firstly, I shared this install video of the 107mm 44T 9mm HTD5m ABEC wheel pulley with @JuniorPotato93 and now have it on a public link.  Caveat being, that it is long-ish and I have not edited it down (this is not my "wheelhouse" lol).  Was not sure how to show where the pulley met the interior cone uro vs plastic hub, so showed it a few different ways.  If people view it, maybe they can suggest better ways or different angles to picture it from.

This is a 3Dhub print with PLA 100 micron layer, 80%-ish infill I believe

As for reactions, it still is a great fit from my readout.  I would suggest if it makes sense to get another tester to also try it also, for more input before calling it done, someone who has a 107mm build ready or at least the wheels should speak up here.  I was not able to fully test under load as am short a motor and belt pulley solution that truly fits.  I did light test unsafely fitting it onto my evolve (took 8-9 washers, leaving little thread to bolt), but not a proper full ride under load to listen, feel during and inspect afterwards.

I did not uncover any issues, and if pressed to come up with any perfect world modifications, it would only be to perhaps tinker with/expand the cone thickness/angle to see if it can sit directly onto the entire interior slope of the urothane in addition to sitting on the plastic wheel core outside the bearing.  Same for the retainer perhaps.

That said, there is no loose fit or play in the pulley at all once installed as-is, even with only a loose hand tighten of 3 M5 bolts and nuts that also were just what I had sitting around (not perfect length or nut size).  So bolted down properly, this thing is secure and functional.  And better it sits directly engaged with the plastic core than only the uro cone.

The only other thing would be question of flanges.  The pulley I tested did not have a extended wheelside interior flange (or other side) so does not have an extra correction barrier from belt/wheel rub if motor pulley is not exactly positioned correctly.  Seems people are of different opinions on whether flanges are helpful or redundant and takes more space in an already tight situation.  I would maybe consider a small wheelside interior flange, or flanged versions in addition to non-flanged (or a print option for those who know what they are doing with printing, unlike me lol).

Anyway, let me and @JuniorPotato93 know your thoughts, other things to answer or show here for those looking for review.

And happy to have others take a trial as well!

lol would need a urothane rim on a 60T pulley!

On a somewhat related note, I am getting inconsistent results using the pulley belt and center distance calculators:
https://sdp-si.com/eStore/CenterDistanceDesigner
http://www.bbman.com/belt-length-calculator/

Not sure I am inputting the right calcs here, can someone give me any pointers.  For example, I have a 15T motor pulley that I was going to use with the 44T wheel pulley resulting in a pretty long belt at 310mm.  Checked calcs on both links with more traditional 14T 36T = 260mm belt but not super clear I understand input for center distance (63mm) and the min teeth in mesh or 5 or 6?

As I will be ordering belts for several of the 107mm higher teeth count wheel pulleys I would like to get this right!  Can someone double check and explain on both online calculators above, using 15T/44T, 14T/36T and another example so that I can then start to use it correctly with proper center distance inputs/outputs.  I know, noob question lol!

There is a flange on both side. The belt will never touch your wheel.  The flange on the wheel side is the same diameter as the teeth themselves. For two reasons really, first of which you can print without having to support it. (even though you should be printing these with support anyways for the cutouts that accept the hardware). And the second is thats all you need to prevent it from drifting. Theres 1.5mm between the wheel and the inside of the flange so thats the closest your belt will ever get to touching the wheel. 

I'd like to make it a closer fit to the urethane as well though I didnt want it to be too big first time around.  How much bigger we can go is hard to know without being able to measure that and get a feel for it even though your video is quite informative.  I leave for school in 8 days so if we cant figure it out by then I'll put out the 107 series as is since at the very least it works. We can try improving upon it throughout the year if as they get printed and more feedback comes in.

I agree in the flange issue, as it is the flange at tooth depth is sufficient to keep belt from wandering and rubbing wheel. Anything worse wild mean the motor pulley is the problem.

On fit, you found the right balance in not rubbing against the uro.  I am happy as-is but if you have a method for me to give you more precise measurements then I can try. Not sure what would work, calipers or maybe getting some clay and forming it inside the cone then taking it out to measure?

As I said, I am good as-is if you want to go final and crank out the tooth & widh versions you have in mind. Not hearing from anyone else so...anyone else have an opinion?  Maybe we should also post this in the other 107mm thread. 

@longhairedboy any guidance?

So I've spent the day fixing the files but wont get the chance to release them tonight as I'm expected elsewhere. So I'm waiting for @E-Boarding or @caustin just double check the depth measurements for the MBS-Wheel from the 46mm ring around the core to the back of the wheel.   Or if anyone else has a set of calipers and can check that it would be greatly appreciated. 

So I'll be able to upload all the files tomorrow evening. Will update the Both Kegels, the Flywheels and Clones, a new one for the MBS all terrain wheel since the depth is different (need a confirming number, tentatively 6mm) and will be making the 107 series as well, those to be improved as more people use them.  All available in 9mm,12mm, and 15mm belt widths. I think that will be it from me before school as I have one other project with pullies to finish as well.  Will confirm when all the fixed files are uploaded.

This is awesom @JuniorPotato93. I have the MBS wheels to measure but no calipers. Can give it a try I the morning and report back but not sure about the precision accuracy.  I remember seeing this come up in a thread earlier, the depth of the uro layer that separates the black plastic wheel core from the pulley side of wheel. The part that @E-Boarding carved out of his wheel and looked like around 6mm. I will try and confirm 6mm or see if +\- mm.

That's was kinda the idea. Here's my reasoning though. My entire build has fucked me on import fees and taxes and shipping fees for importing things to Canada.  My budget has got through the roof  because of it. I paid 20 dollars for motor pulleys and was charge 43 dollars for duty when it crossed the border.(Canada) Like what the actual flying butt nuggets is that load of bs. So I refused to buy a pulley for my wheels. And then I figured it can't be just me. So this is my gift to everyone who's ever been fucked by shipping.

I'm not asking for anything. There's been a lot of people asking for paypal and I've said no for a while but I ended up putting a donation link on Thingiverse but you don't need to.

My goal was to provide options for those in the community.  It's expensive for a small company to off so many options for a number of wheels. Each mold for these pulleys in different belt widths to fabricate is easily a couple grand for each if not more.  They'd charge up the butt to be able to make their money back in a reasonable period of time.  So if I can help out and provide option in exchange for some of my time then why not. Especially when it's gonna end up costing you a few bucks to 3D print.  It helps out so many more people than just us since i realize is not something that everyone has access to. And this site.  There's been over a thousand downloads collectively so it can't be just us on this site.  I'll be putting a link to this site in the description to help increase our community numbers and participation as well.

if nothing else the flange just helps keep the pully flush and level against the wheel while keeping it a safe distance from the urethane.

Honestly I figured most of you guys would be using metric so that's what I went with. Like even here in Canada you'll find very few metric options in stock  at home depot but they'll have all the imperial available 100% of the time, so I went with that.  Also, look like the m5 nut is 8.00mm across the flats and the 10-32 or 10-34 is 9.54mm. The hexagonal cut out is sized for 10.05mm to allow for shrinkage from print general tolerance of mosrn3D printers.  Honestly  though, putting the screw in backwards is not a huge deal if you're going to use metric.

M6 nuts are 10mm across the flats. May be a tight fit but could work. Though the holes are intended to be for the 10-32(or 24) or as seen an M5 fits as well. Not sure about the M6. You may have to bore out the holes. The extra trouble may not be worth it. Just go in reverse.

I'm doing a couple of builds with these wheels now, and just finished one up. they do really well on the sidewalks. ITs less of a DA-DUNK DA-DUNK DA-DUNK and more of a bmmpa bmmpa bmmpa on the sidewalks. Far more tolerable than some other wheels. I think not only the 78a durometer helps but also the rounded profile and texture of the wheel. Kind of hard to compare them to flat patch wheels like ABECs.

Yeah, I like the MBS-wheels though a different feel, you have to try them I think @Namasaki as you might find them too hard or slick (in wet condition) depending on your preferences.  They do ride differently.

@E-Boarding and @longhairedboy I am going to print a few of the MBS pulleys from @JuniorPotato93 for this weekend.  What size did you find worked best for your builds, looks like you tried 40T, 50T, maybe 44T?  What size motor pulley and gearing ratio did you end up with best?  Guessing maybe I try middle of the road 44T/15T with 100mm MBS?

I'd like to try some 40's 

Believe it or not i was using a 14/36 with stock enertion motor and wheel insert pulleys on that hornet build and it was climbing grass hills. That was with dual SK3 149kv 6374 motors in a dual diagonal config. I'm about to try the same thing on dual R-SPEC 6355s in both dual rear and dual diagonal configs. We'll see how they compare with what that hornet was doing. I have a feeling they'll do just as well despite thier size and KV difference. 

I keep saying this but it bears repeating. These wheels are amazing for shit terrain, but not the kind of stuff you would do with pneumies. They lose traction quickly in loose sand and they get buried in looser soil as well. But on packed dirt with some gravel and shitty cracked up over grown sidewalks they're awesome. I didn't get to try cobblestone/brick roads but i'm sure they're great on that too. I'll probably try these next two on brick roads and get it on instagram.

I've 50t on print, should arrive this week. But I need new Belts and VESCs too before testing them with big load.

I was using 13t:40t with Enertion Dual-SetUp but 40km/h is way to much for me (30 km/h is fine). I mostly use this board riding 10-20 km/h on sidewalks with 2 kids on a trailer and need that torgue, especially on short hills and dirt or grass in the local park.

@JuniorPotato93
I've a little issue, In the other thread you wrote "these are 6mm from the 46mm outer hub ring to wheel instead of 7.65mm that clones and ABEC flywheels are"

The height of my 97mm flywheels are 6mm (like the mbs-wheels).
My Enertion Wheels (flywheel clones) have about 8mm (or 7.65mm)

left the orignal 40t thingniverse-pulley (pulleyinsert40t_15mm_111514)
right your 48t pulley (48T-HTD5-15_PRINTABLE_PULLEY_LOCK_NUT_REVISION)

So I suggest printing the MBS-pulley for original flywheels, these pulleys may fit clones but not 97mm abecs (i don't know if they are different to other flywheels)

My Flywheels have 6mm (Enertion Wheels have 7.6mm) and these pulleys do not fit close on Flywheels, they may fit clones. Maybe there are different clones. Most clones have thick spokes but I don't know. Just make sure these pulleys fit before you print with Nylon and waste money.

So I have not tried these on my caliber II trucks.  The internal clearance of the lowest point on the nuts is about 23-24mm if I remember correctly.  It **might** work without modifications. YOU DO NOT HAVE TO CUT OFF ANY PART OF THE TRUCKS THOUGH, like you eocwith the enertion pulley. Though you may need to round over the 2 sharp edges of the caliber II truck hanger for there to be sufficient clearance. Roughly about 3/4 of an inch deep from the end of the hanger.

There are no STL files for snap in versions ofor these pulleys.  Here's why. 

The weakest point on a 3D printed part is the interplane bonding (between 2 print planes) the strongest parts are the intraplane bonding (in one plane.).

Knowing that, how do these pulleys have to be printed? With the pulley face down which results in the Retainer or the mating portions being face up. In such a way that the Retainer is being printed in the same plane as the shear stresses when it's in use. So when you go to accelerate or even worse, brake, there's a hight likelihood that if there's a defect in print or say you're a 180lbs rider using a mono drive that the forces acting on the pulley may exceed those of the interplaner bonds. 

On top of that there's actually a different pulley in enertions pulleys that you put into skate wheels.  Main difference being there's an additional  flange that essentially holds the pulley up against the inside of wheel and prevents it from drifting over onto the hanger.  You could in theory achieve the same effect with a 3D printed pulley but again the thin flange is taking a lot of forces as its all that prevents it from drifting apart from an extremely tight fit into the hub of the wheel. 

Enertions and evolves pulleys are nylon  injection molded and are capable of withstanding those forces for repeated use and abuse.  3D printed parts will pronably not withstand it very long. They may be able to if you print at 100% infill and you get a really good quality print.  But I'm not betting your lives on it. If it's not something I would feel safe enough to put on my own board I wouldn't put it out there for you to put on yours.

If you could share any one solidworks file with me, I could make the snap in version quickly with space for bearing and everything.

I intend to print it from shapeways(nylon sintering method) and I am confident that it will hold up to whatever abuse I hurl at it. I have tried destroying it, it just doesn't. 

The snap in version is just so convenient that we shouldn't just ignore it.

## \#212 Posted by: JuniorPotato93 Posted at: 2016-09-12T15:49:55.587Z Reads: 321

```
Any nylon filaments will probably be really resistant to wear so I dont see any issues with Taulman 910.  The pinion gear though you should not print. It will have very few teeth meshing with the belt at any given time and so will wear very rapidly. On top of that you'll have a lot strain being put into the material and if there is no keyway to distribute that across the whole length of the pulley, in which case youd use a set screw, youll also get excessive wear very quickly. Even with a keyway youre still going to have very rapid wear on the teeth so thats not a permanent solution.

Great work! Is there any way to redesign them just a little so they do not require supports? Like the outside retainer just be flat all the way around down the the bed, and some tweaks to the actual pulley. I think good print quality can be sacrificed for some aesthetics. If you can't, I'd be more than happy to.

I dont quite understand the concern here. All of these require a cavity for the nut or the head of the  bolt to sit flush on the back and as such will require you to print with support. You CAN print these without support but the face that meets with the nut or bolts will come out a little messed up so I dont recommend it. But also the support on these is minimal, it doesnt add a whole bunch of print time or use excess material so again I fail to see the concern.

The brim is about the same size as the pulley apart from on the 34T because the pulley is much smaller than the cone on the back of the wheel so the cone is left as the same because these were designed to be reproduced quickly in multiple sizes so the matting portion of all these are identical.

As to sharing the cad files, I've mentioned before I dont like to. Much like @FLATLINEcustoms, I will share all my stls with the community but the cad files I chose to remain private. At least for now since there is still a few things I want to do with the series but havent had the time. Maybe once I've finished with them I'll do a mass upload of source files but for now they'll remain private. This is more of a quality control than anything else really, I want t make sure whats being put out there will meet the expectations we all and I put on these, my expectations being a lot higher then yours probably. because I spent a lot of time designing these to be adaptable to allow for this style of mass dump in a relatively brief period of time.

Edit: I made the comment that maybe I would upload the source files once I was bored of them but was not the message I really wanted to come across so I removed that from the original post.  I have put a lot of effort into creating all these files,the abecs, mtbs, kegels and 107's. If you count up the total number of source files its like 120 pulleys, that's a lot of files to go back and re upload. There is still work I want to do on these to make them better and add another series or two is what I meant.  Its time consuming and it's something I would like to complete myself as it's something I set out to do. There may reach a time i've had enough of pulleys for a lifetime and once i've reached that then we'll see about source files.

Those are the same ones that I bought. Wishing I would have gone a little bigger, but those 83mm ones have been working fine for me.

When you get them, make sure you put the bearings in and free spin them all. A couple of mine have a slight wobble to them that I'm glad I caught. Going 20mph+ on a naturally wobbly wheel doesn't sound safe or right, so look for the one that spins the most straight and true and make that wheel your drive wheel (or wheels if you're doing dual drive).

Today I totally wrecked my pulley after a few weeks.
This print was 200microns PLA but I don't know what the infill was, I could not choose infill on 3DHubs, but it was too low obviously :)
I'm going to reprint this but what printing parameters do you guys suggest from your experince, maybe print them with Nylon?

The pulles started breaking when the belt sometimes got over the flange, the flange broke and the tooths lost its support and everything flew appart piece by piece.

Pricing on the pulley depends on what you want printed.  PM me for more info  Usually a single pulley/retainer is 4-6 bucks

No you can't use two 6374 motors on this truck.   You can use 6355s. Those will likely fit.  But you'll likely also have to use 9mm belts to make it work

The Enertion pulley don't have the inner flange, so that's good for you and you can add a few more speedrings to get 1-2mm.

I did some calculations:
total length: 28,7cm
2 Nuts, 2 Speedrings: 1,4cm
Wheel + 9mm-Enertion-pulley: 5,2cm each
6355 Motor + Enertion Motor Mount: 6,3cm each

sum: 24,4cm

+ bigger motor: +1,9 cm each
+ bigger belt: +0,3cm each

= 28,6cm

that's a bit below 28,7cm but you want some space between pulley and motor mount and between the 2 motors aswell, so I would say no, it's too close, better go with 9mm belt.

I'll answer this here @imike in case someone else has the same question, though I did see your pm. 
These are HTD 5. Meaning they're 5mm pitch. That is why they do not fit with your 3mm pitch belt. 

Boosted used 3mm pitch I believe but their pulley does not work for a flywheel.

@JuniorPotato93 thanks for the insight. Since these are models couldn't we get a 3mm pulley and adapt the insert to a flywheel and then print? (I'm not asking you to do that, I can have it done, I'm just asking for the principle...)
If so, where could I find a 3mm 3dmodel?

Thanks for the great work @JuniorPotato93.
I have a question regarding the best print filament for these pulleys. I read a lot about PETG in this thread, but elsewhere I also read something about nylon and ABS. So my question is what filament is the best for durable pulleys? I have heard that PLA is to temperature sensitive, but what about Nylon and ABS. Thanks.

@PXSS I dont think you are using a 10-32 bolt/screw if the nut is capable of freely rotating in the socket. The most common width of a 10-32 or a 10-24 threaded nut is 3/8th. These sockets are just slightly over sized (by about .75mm if I remember correctly) to allow for some shrinkage and for tolerances stack up. I've printed these myself to ensure they work before I uploaded the series. That being said you you can put the heads in the back and the nuts on the front too, functionally it's the same. It will still clamp.

@imike, Yes it can be done. You can find the file you are searching for at B&B Manufacturing's website. I'm in the midst of my last wave of midterms but if you pm your email and give me a week or two that is a relatively simple request I could do that for you.

@hexakopter PETG is an all round great filament if you have it, if not you can use anything really. All 3D printed pulleys will wear as will CNC'ed pulleys it's just a matter of the rate at which they do it. Obviously 3D printer filaments wear faster, the difference  between the same pulley in different filaments I'm not sure. you can expect a couple hundred miles, from ABS from what I hear. Nylon you can expect even more from. Nylon pulleys made on a SLS 3D printer have the best wear resistance I've seen and compare in quality and build to that of a nylon injected pulley. Very solid pieces, but they cost more but you could get a thousand miles out of it potentially, I dont really know. 

Long story short, if you're printing these yourself use what you've got, you're going to have to replace them eventually anyways. If you're having them printed, PETG or ABS is suitable, PLA not so much, nylon if it's not substantially more may be worth it. if it is, stick with the cheaper option.

Pretty sure I have 10-32s.... 
Just measured my nuts to be sure and surely they are 3/8s. The hole is substantially larger in my print. Measured 50 thousands larger in diameter which is just slightly smaller than the diagonal length so they still spin when you apply any torque. 

An oversized of more than 20 thousands in my experience is way over. I personally oversized between 10-15 thousands depending on material

I have had about 6-8 issues that I can vividly remember with any of the pulleys across all files shared with regards to the pulley portion of the prints not engaging the belt properly. All but 1(the first 33T pulley file I ever made and someone printed a test print) were printer quality issues. 

That being said the 42T pulley is also one where I made the pulley from scratch but I've yet to receive feedback that it doesn't fit properly. 

For all other parts I use a manufacturers(B&B Manufacturing) 3D pulley file and I merge my retainer portion with theirs. I printed 4 pulleys when I still had daily access to printers and I did 34, 36, 44 and 40 as sections and tested those as a sample and found their files to be suitable for 3D printing.

Hope that helps.

some amazing work.  but,  does anyone know where I can get a 32T 15mm one from?  im pretty handy at using Inventor and fustion 360 but I have no clue how to make a pulley.

I don't make the pulley portion of the prints either, you definitely could but why reinvent the wheel. So go to B&B manufacturing, look at the timing pulleys section and then just play around with the side bar and narrow down your search. Input some info and download your file.

Pretty much everything.. currently I'm running PLA printed ones just fine.

However I recommend to anneal/harden the PLA prints.

To do so, keep the pulley on the bed after printing and put some kind of insulated lid over it (for me its just a cardboard thing I made with some foam insulation and tin foil on the outside.)
Increase the bed temperature evrery 5-10minutes or so by 5°C up to 73-75°C let it sit there for an hour and then decrease the temperature in the same slow and controlled way back to room temperature.

This hardens the PLA and also makes it more temperature resistent.
Here is a video about it https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZX8eHC7fws

However I don't recommend just putting it in the oven since that might lead to too much warping.
If the print is still stuck to the built plate, that prevents most of the warpage.

My usual trip length is around 12km at speeds from 25-40km/h and the pulleys do get warm (I'd say 50°C) but so far show no signs of wear or any heat damage.

Also sucessfully tried HIPS filament (the cheap stuff from hobbyking)

But would you say that pteg or abs is better in the lon run ? And do i need to heat them as well ?

I'd go with PETG.. its much easier to print than ABS and I think is harder, too. It will break where ABS would bend but its plenty strong enough for pulleys. The higher hardness means better wear resistence. Its good for up to 80°C which would never be reached unless something is really wrong and introducing unnecessary friction with your pulley/belt setup.

Don't know if you can anneal PETG or ABS.. probably but you have to google that yourself.

The only thing better Then PETG/PLA/HIPS/PC is Nylon I guess but its tricky to print.

That is because 3D printed motor pulleys do not last. There is simply too few teeth engaged and the forces too high. They wear out far too quickly to be a viable solution to use as a long term part of your build. Luckily for you motor pulleys are very abundant, although not sure about that at 15mm width, but these already exist. I spend my time on things that dont or are niche items that would otherwise need to be custom made.
Good luck.

Hi, I have printed a 36T Pulley for my Abec 11 97mm Flywheels and yes they fit, but it´s a really tight fit. In addition the pulley does not close with my wheel, there is "air". Are these Pulleys mostly for the 107mm and 83mm and not for the 97mm Abec Flywheels ? I have original ones.
```

These are a tight fit yes, that helps ensure that they are concentric to the hub which is what you want. With regards to the "air" between the pulley and the wheel please provide a picture for clarification as that can be interpreted in many ways. These sit flush to the hub/core where they meet the urethane, not necessarily to the middle of the hub where the bearings are seated. If you're taking about the exterior of the pulley and the urethane of the wheel then it's not an issue, you're not driving the urethane you're driving the hub, extra contact on the urethane is not necessary.  If that is not the issue you're talking about then provide a picture and I can get back to you on that. 

107 have they're own pulley as they are significantly different in dimensions, if you wiah to see how different then look up the 107 series I made just for them. 

These should fit both original and clones though the tolerances may be different from make to make so keep that in mind but once you bolt these on that is not an issue, it will sit flush to the hub and it will sit concentric to the hub.

Okay, thanks. That helped a lot. I thought the pulley would sit flush, so it touches the urethane (learned that word, too :D). My pulley is not perfect round or the wheel is a little bit off center, because the pulley wobbles a bit. Maybe thats an issue of my 3D Printer. I will print a new pulley with 44T instead of 36T to get more torque. So i thought, if it sits their without "air" in between there would be a better power transmission, but now i´m understanding that this isn´t the case.

Thx for the hint about the M6. I ll try what better fits. I just thought so safe some weight by using M5 or M4...

![image|375x500](upload://b0lIMZp2ZHHLXLaZSnQ81RD215Z.jpeg) I made a mistake. I always thought that the 107 and 97mm versions have the same core... but the dont. U need a much longer pulley for the 107ers.  I have just the 97 wheels... 

Anyway, i modified the Pulley to fit nicely into the 97mm ABECS. I ll upload them after i tested them in real life. I can also make one for 107ers with the correct bore/hex size, but cant test it.

Printed in ABS... ROCK SOLID. U just have to know how to print ABS, then its incredible strong. Sorry... aluminum is also my wish... but i love to experiment too much... would be to crazy to have that many pulleys in aluminum :smiley:

There are two 107mm wheels... the SuperFly wheels (107mm) and the Electric Flywheels (107mm).

The Superfly Wheels (107mm) fit the same pulleys as the Flywheels (97mm).  The Electric Flywheels (107mm) use different pulleys.

No, the Electric Flywheels have a centerset core.  The Superfly Wheels and the Flywheels (also called ReFly wheels if poured in a different polyurethane) have an offset core.  Here are all 3 superimposed on one another.  The fatter 107mm is the Electric Flywheel and the one that doesn't fit the same pulleys.

So to reiterate ...

only the Electric Flywheels are incompatible with the pulleys for the rest
