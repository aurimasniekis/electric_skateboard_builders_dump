Hi guys,

I understand that the law concerning electric skateboarding varies wildly across the world and, given that the UK still does not cover e-skates in law, I would like to know for sure what's going on in other countries. I started to write a document on it but I'm a bit stuck, as I don't speak all the languages in the world! :smiley:

Would it be possible for the community to add to this, by replying what's the law like in your respective country (including any restrictions and the source of your information)? I just think it would be great to have a central repository for all the law info... I'll share the document once ready.

Cheers,
Ricardo

I just googled and was surprised

So in Croatia max power for electric bikes  is 1/4 kW and 25kmh without pedaling

and all other vehicles without pedals go in a moped category that's up to 4kW and 45kmh

Anyways I have a 75cc moped that goes 60kmh and was stopped by police only once because I forgot my helmet

I think it's a good idea to have all the legality information in one place. Just a note though, in California, you're allowed on roads with speed limits up to 35mph, not below. 

And I think the laws in Cali are a bit different than the rest of the US.

thank you for that!

So e-skates in Croatia can be up to 4kW and go up to 30mph?? Sounds a bit lenient, considering what I've been reading from other countries!

Would it be possible for you to share your source? Preferably a link to the law, even if it's in Croatian?

Cheers,
Ricardo

This is some goverment site translated "Center for vehicles Croatia"

And this news [site](https://lokalni.vecernji.hr/gradovi/policija-razjasnila-dvojbe-oko-zakonskih-obveza-vlasnika-elektricnih-bicikala-3641) where its easier to read

Thats probably because there aren't any accidents and a very few people ride stuff like those electric scooters etc

you should add country / state in the first column because California is a state not country and other places in the US have different laws, for example Michigan (https://starkmobility.com/blogs/news/are-electric-skateboards-legal-to-ride). And has anyone ever had their board taken away/fined in Cali, because I don't want to spend all this time making a custom esk8 just to have it taken away. Thank you for making this page.

Here in Brazil there is a ebike law stating 250w and 25 km/h if I’m not mistaken

Nothing about ESK8, I never had a problem ridding in front of cops in at least 4 cities

Denmark per 1/1-2019 states that it has to have a factory limit of 20km/h, insurence is legally needed (No company will offer it though) the board has to have a CE certification. 

And you need lights.

And then they also have something like max 30km per charge and up to 10KG for the board.

Basicly more or less illegal here.

USA: How illegal varies by state. For the most part a motorized vehicle (regardless of electric or gas) is not allowed on the road (including bike lane) without insurance and a licence plate (which you can't get)

On the sidewalks, no motorized vehicles period. (How bird and lime get away, beats me)

Now for my specific area, I've ridden in front of at least 20 of the area's cop cars and not one has bothered to pull me over. I ride both in the road, bike lanes, and sidewalks.

Only ebikes from what i can find. 3 cat: under 25kmh and pedal assisted, over 25 and pedal (special insurance and needs to have a certificate of conformity) , speedpedelec (45kmh) (needs a permit)
I believe it has been voted today that the last 2 ones will need to have a license plate (for sure the speed ones) 

Due to the above,up to 2 wheel vehicles are regulated. A one/mono wheel type of vehicle seems for the moment to be able to take advantage of this as being somewhat legal. Eskates are completely grey area. Ive heard in some cities they take it from you, but no issues here (went voting on my board, drove past several officers in different cities).

So in short: grey area, tolerated almost everywhere. Our community is strong about helmet and lights to set the best possible image about eskaters

My prediction is that next year (in US) we will see a new wave of riders with prebuilt boards. They are cheap enough now that most students can buy them. It will trickle down and you will see them in some retail stores. I don't doubt this will bring new regulation as there will always be those that don't wear helmets and these things go much faster than hover boards.

That australian link talks about scooters and not esk8 if I'm not mistaken.  Its unclear what constitutes legality here in QLD regarding powered skateboards.  No doubt it will be made clear and heavy restrictions will be enforced due to a death last year on the gold coast.  As it stands the police leave you alone if you are sensible.  I have been stopped once (so the guy could try my board) and told to slow down once due to my own silliness (60kmh down the main street) but in general we are still under the radar.

oh dear.... speeding on eDevices can get you banned from the roads in the UK ?!?!

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/14/boy-gets-six-points-on-future-driving-licence-for-scooter-speeding

"The law – based on an 1835 Highways Act, according to scooter maker Micro – lags behind those in elsewhere in Europe. In France electric scooters can be ridden on cycle lanes and the pavement, provided riders keep to a speed limit; in Germany pavement riding is legal up to 6km/h (nearly 4mph); and in Austria and Switzerland riders can bomb down cycle lanes and on roads at up to 25km/h."

Well It depends on how well you can play a gypsy/traveller they get away with everything LoL.

all jokes with truth aside you can basically buddy up to cops or just be polite and keep moving on if you get a bad cop find a way to start talking to another.

I had 1 cop tell me not to ride on the road so on that day I made sure to find 3 other cops and I asked them is it fine if I ride on the road and that way I kinda got permission from 3 cops so 3vs1 hurrah LoL.
(3 copers were in a group)

That's a very interesting article @skateborad. 

Considering that the human body can in average produce 300-400w continualy, one would assume electric skateboards could be legislated to around 800w continuous (possibly 4 or 5x that peak value?) at the wheel - this still seems low, considering some of the setups around.

Is there any bright mind around that can calculate the loss of power due to friction on e-skateboards that use belt setups (as opposed to in-wheel motors)?

Well the situation in germany was discused a few times in this forum.

But I will try to write what I know.
In the german law are esk8 (like many/most modern personal transportation devices) not characterized in particular  yet . What sounds like "Well, gray zone then. We can do what we want." isn`t the case the last sentence in particular.
Because what is specified about any serious esk8 is that any transportation device that is meant to be driven motorized only with a max. speed above 6 km/h by construction design is counting as a motor vehicle.

Any motor vehicle in germany to drive on public ground (basicly anything, even private parking lots that have no closed gate which are rare and most of the time forbidden for unauthorized people) need liability insurance , driving without liability insurance is a criminal offense. It can be charged with points in our trafic register (which can cause the lose of the driver license), a fine or even up to 3 months in prison when you -driving without insurence- cause recklessly an accident. The fine can be up to 180 daily rates (a daily rate is the average income a day after taxes of the person, this times the amount of daily rates is the fine) by the way a verdict of 30 daily rates or more in the past is treated as previously convicted by law.
The problem is that it`s not possible to get a liabilty insurence for a motor vehicle without registration/characterization of the vehicle.

There are some small kinda loopholes, like a rejected liability insurence registration that can count in court as  insured (because of a german law for insurence companies) but in reality this requieres a valid registration attampt that isnt possible because you can`t fill the vehicle class.
Or in theory,a special single registration of the vehicle (that would cost you quite some time and money to acquire anyway) which is also not possible with a real esk8 because of requirements like a handlebar and hight requriements for example ... maybe a unnecessary big and heavy MTB with some kind of handlebar and 15k€ for the registration could work.

So to get new kinds of vehicles -electric ones in particular-  legalized in germany is very hard and takes time, money and lobby work.
Pedelecs in germany that support the user up to 25 km/h don`t need a regiastration, insurance nor needs the driver to wear a helmet by law. 
Ebikes up to 45 km/h need insurance, a license (lower tier than car for people that are at least 16 years old, that requires a low amount of training by german standarts and costs about 600€ total) and also a helmet. 

Above 45 km/h they are considered a electric motorcycle needs insurance, a motorcycle license (costs about 2-3k€ the requried training takes also quite some time you need to be at least 21 zears old), you also have an extra yearly tax to pay and of course need to wear a helmet.

Yes, on 2017 they did regulated e bikes, but most of the users do not apply de law; I guess because everything here it is applied after an accident or incident, like who is going to pay for the damage or injuries. Below is the new regulation, in Spanish, hope it helps! Other than that, nothing on e boards yet...

So in summary, e-skates are illegal in Germany right? I thought there was some effort to get legislation passed for 2019?

So this is what the spreadsheet is looking like now. Is there an easy way of sharing the file in here, instead of just having a screenshot?

As always, it would be great if we could get more countries represented in the spreadsheet. Keep your country's regulations coming so that they can be added in!

Yes it's  illegal .. 
even with the potential to get convicted which can make you loose your job and will make it tough to get any serious job again (for the next 3 years, any convict in that time  -> 10 years)
But I don't know of any serious case beside one with a 1,5k fine if I remember correctly.

And that law thing thats going on in it's current state is basicly only for scooters and will replace the exception sagways currently have (requirement of a handlebar and I think hight requirements a eMTB with a detachable handlebar might work for 12 - 20km/h ...)

Well **(1.)** there is the law that states that any motor vehicle need to have a liability insurance (with kinda high possible penalties).
**(2.)** At the same time insurance companies have to specify the correct motor vehicle with it' precise classification.
These precise classifications are -characteristically German- most often to precise tbh and equiped with limiting boundaries so that they disqualify many kinds of modifications and inventions. And **(3.)**  it's timeconsuming/costly to get new classifications done because of all that bureaucracy, so whithout big investors, lobbyists, big companies or at least a heap of public interest (which has to grow in a grayzone in legal danger) it will be illegal.

It is not completely correct. It's 25kg. and there are no limit on how far you can go in one charge ;)

Actually there are no limit on motor and battery size or power. "Just" the 20 km/h.

In my born country, Colombia, I'm not so sure if there is a law for Esk8, probably not since its a new hobby. No cop chase Sk8ters, so they are invisible, but then, they don't ride on the streets like in the US, only bikers do. So, what I'm trying to say is: the thing is sort of subliminal there; if you are noticed and the vehicle looks expensive, they will certainly apply some laws (stupid way of thinking: if you 'look' millionaire, ride expensive toys, and have fun, they will tax you, ban you an apply all sorts of laws in order to milk $$ you in all possible ways). If you pass unnoticed, nobody will care about you. I don't think people will try to ride Esk8s there, they lack the childish, free relaxed attitude we Esk8ers have on other latitudes. 

Thats why San Francisco is a haven, they became acostumed to us, they know we came to stay, we made our own room over these streets. Bike paths are ours now. So there is no turning back for anyone. We earned our right. So the mind set won the law battle before it started. If they ever try to ban us, or restrict the usage, they will face a challenge: how to restrict one vehicle when others are already there for long time? street cars, cable cars, bicycles, skateboards, scooters, skates... and now electric skateboards, electric scooters, electric bikes, electric monocycles. On a socialist melting pot city like this? Naawww!

Changes achieved in Queensland Australia.

I received this email recently....

We are pleased to announce that as of today, electric skateboards are now legal to ride in public areas with some restrictions. Evolve Skateboards were part of this legislation process which was held in Melbourne recently along with Lime Scooters and one other mobility scooter manufacturer.  We were the only electric skateboard company at this work shop event and were able to speak on behalf of the customer voice and make recommendations that we feel were fair for both road safety and electric skateboard users. We’re happy to say that every recommendation we made at the workshop has now been passed as law!  Please see below a summary of what these law changes are -
1.	Electric Skateboards have access to paths, including foot paths, shared paths, separated paths 
and bicycle paths. When using a shared path, the bicycle side must be used. 

2.	Users must not travel on a path where a ‘no PMD sign’ prohibits access. Local councils have the power to prohibit the use of these devices in areas such as malls, esplanades and jetties. A user travelling on a path must give way to pedestrians, travel at a safe speed appropriate to the conditions and be able to stop safely to avoid a collision with pedestrians. The on-the-spot fine offences against any of these provisions is $130. 

3.	Electric Skateboards have been provided limited access to the road network for use on local roads. However, riders should avoid interacting with traffic and must not ride on main roads or CBD streets. Under the legislation, a user may travel on a road provided the road has a speed limit of 50km/h or less, has no dividing line or median strip and is not a one-way road with more than one marked lane. The on-the-spot fine for travelling on a prohibited road is $130. 

4.	The maximum speed limit a user may travel is 25km/h. The on-the-spot fine for exceeding this speed limit is $174. 

5.	The user must not be towed by a vehicle, and a user must not hold onto a vehicle while the vehicle is moving. They are also not permitted to travel within two metres of the rear of a moving vehicle for more than 200 metres. The on-the-spot fine for committing these offences is $130. 

6.	To help ensure that rideables are used safely and responsibly, the on-the-spot fines for the following offences have been increased to $130: 

•	Fail to keep to the left on a path or road

•	Ride more than two abreast on a road

•	Have more than one rider on the device

•	Fail to keep to the left of an oncoming bike rider on a path 
•	Fail to have lights on at night or in poor weather. 
7.	Helmets are compulsory and no drink riding is permitted.

Everyone in Australia should be forwarding this document to all esk8 groups around the country and encouraging everyone to have a say on this. Public opinion will help to get us laws that are inclusive of our vehicles whilst also not being too restrictive

It is a great opportunity to influence things like Top speed, bike path usage, ect. 

I know that curtain decision makers still view eskate as toys and not as a viable travel mode.

Hey man,

A nice article for Austria and Germany (in German):

https://autorevue.at/ratgeber/e-skateboards-recht-regeln-gesetz

Summary: in Austria yes, as long as they are not in roads (they are considered toys even if they have motors). Germany, its a no.

Regards!
