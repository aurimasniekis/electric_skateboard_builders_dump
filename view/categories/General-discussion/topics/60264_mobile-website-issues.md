Is it just me or is responding to comments on mobile a bitch like 90% of the time I won't be able to click the lower third of the webpage making it impossible to reply to comments.

This only happens when commenting and something freaks out when my keyboard pops up. Doesn't always happen though. 

And the only way to fix it is enter desktop mode and send the comment that way. 

Something is super fucky. Is it just me or how do you guys deal with this?

 The same thing was happening to me. Had no idea there was an app. Bloody year on the forum, mostly accessed from my phone. Missed that. 
Thanks @JLabs and thanks @strattos!
P.s. you done your build yet? We should go riding soon.
Edit: App keeps forcing a shutdown when trying to search the forum.
Double edit: Read the link jlabs provided. Works fine.
