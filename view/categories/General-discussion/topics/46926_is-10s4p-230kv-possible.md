Hey guys,  

I have a twin 230kv motor setup with a 10s4p battery.  I was originally told the motors were 190kv before buying, though they are marked 230kv.  I get different opinions on whether i will blow up my FOCboxes with this setup.

Thanks

Set a maximum erpm in the ESC settings

Set erpm max to 60 000. Will be fine.

Uncheck limit ERPM with Negative torque? Is anyone running a similar setup?  Does gearing matter?

Best do some more research bud. Can blow vescs up if you arent careful. Some great tutorials on youtube.

drop efficiency to 85%

try 15T / 36T pulleys

keep max erpm below 60,000

I would adjust gearing and wheel size to keep it below 60k erpm vs software limiting

You could exceed that downhill and really not the place you want throttle limiting to kick in

Why don't you replace your motors with 190 KV ones?

@GJHS I am not sure but you can try following these steps mentioned here: http://fishpepper.de/2017/10/17/tutorial-how-to-measure-the-kv-of-a-brushless-motor/

They are KALY motors.  I was just chatting with @scepterr and he believes they are closer to 190kv.  I would like to confirm

Thank you for the results. @GJHS I think you need 190 KV motors.

You might be good, just keep your gear ratios so your max erpm never goes above 60k.
