I can't find a certain deck anywhere online except Longboarder Labs, but they won't ship to U.S. addresses. I'm trying to finish a build, MiamiElectric 12S2P & 170Kv motor, MarcMT mount, with a psychotiller Coupe enclosure and 83mm flywheels. 

The board I had intended on using got stolen recently so now I have to order another. Was hoping someone might be willing to forward a small deck and be reimbursed for shipping + inconvenience. 

Thanks!

@adamm would be your best bet. He lives the closest to the store. Unless Canadian shipping is free. Then it's whoever lives closer to you @FreddyFeelGood...
@Jasonkj3217 I'm in Edmonton too! We should go for a rip sometime.

Try [YCA](https://www.canadianaddress.ca/)? I think that is the Canadian version of [MyUs](https://myus.com) of which I use for American stores that won't ship to Australia.

I was thinking about driving down to the border later this week to pick something up. I could maybe see if I could ship it while I'm down there? If you could get it to me in time. I'm in Winnipeg.
