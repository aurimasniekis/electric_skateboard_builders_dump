i've only seen the term "lost pla" mentioned once in this forum so i thought i'd share this. 

Could be used for pulleys.

It's like when Grant Thompson puts foam in his forge and pours molten metal in.

Microwave forge.  Better to not do lost pla but make a silicone mold of the pla part as apposed to being able to cast only one.  and cast low Temp metal.  I forget maybe it was sychotiller who made a mold and was casting resin parts 
Smooth-on has a bunch of silicone that can do high temp. Not sure what temp u need to melt aluminum or maybe do a bronze

You can. Smooth-on is an easy source and likely are at a local art store or online.
Can't get sychotiller's name to come up but he's done casting of pulleys
