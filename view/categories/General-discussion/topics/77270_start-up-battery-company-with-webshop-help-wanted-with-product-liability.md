Hi esk8 builders,

I have been building batteries for myself, some friends and some people from the forum for two years.
I see that the demand behind li ion packs remains huge. Because of that, I want to tackle it bigger next year
I want to start up a fully professional company. Webshop, mail etc. 

I want to sell complete plug and play packs, but also all the accessories to build a pack yourself. I want to realize delivery times of 48 hours on standard packs.

All this is going to work with sufficient preparation.


Now I only have one problem: What if it goes wrong with one of my packs? (I know if you use my pack correctly, so no flexing on stiff packs, do not make a short circuit, do not abuse with heat etc, It will give you no problem and last long).

We have in Belgium "product liability" (productaansprakelijkheid)(I think in the whole EU) on each product we sell. If things go wrong and someone gets hurt by my product, the insurance will ask me money to pay. I understand the liability, but most people are using my packs inside their DIY boards, So I have no view on what they do with my battery.

Someone any idea how I can solve this problem with liability?

Much thanks!
Pjotr

Ok so I'm not 100% sure about Belgian law. In Austria you could have some sort if box at the checkout that your customers have to tick which says something along those lines:

If there are any faults the seller cannot be held accountable for any kind of damage. 
But that's just my knowledge :smile:

At the moment I report this to the person before he has paid and before the product has been delivered.

When I do everything officially, I have to sell everything according to Belgian law. And the the box that the costumer must tick is sadly not enough here :confused:

Other idea:
What if you take the risk that something happens and take a look at an company insurrance. So if something happens an insurance covers the damage..
Just another idea :slight_smile:

Yes you need a liability insurance for your company

A company insurrance is the first thing I will take, I have made a price request to be insured up to 1 million euros.
But what if someone short-circuits my battery in an apartment building of 20 million euros? I think it can never be ascertained whether the fault was, the battery or the person who shorted it...


It is all a bit complex, I wonder how @psychotiller @longhairedboy @barajabali @scepterr @darkkevind @fottaz  @Acido etc managed all this

I guess you could sell those packs as "not for use in skateboards" or something like that 
That avoids the law, if shit goes south you could say that those batteries weren't used properly example only for bench testing

I didn't read about that law but to me it doesn't make much sense
example you buy 50liters of fuel and put it in your house, it blows up because of miscare and by the law its the pumps fault? 
Im thinking of talking to a lawyer if the buyer signs that im not responsible for anything that could happen is enough, but i never menage to find time

Im also interested on this since Im getting too many orders lately...

I am going to call some experts and lawyers the coming weeks. The part from liability insurance is something I am going to take for 100%. Here in Belgium there are around 1-2 fires each day by bad battery‚Äôs from electric bikes. Because of that I think the insurance will cost me much. 
I know also problem of many orders. Building good battery packs take much time. 
I have also some people around who are asking of repairing their ebike battery. 


I will let you know when I know more about it. I hope that also some other battery builders will reply :slight_smile:

Mate, I'm a hobbyist... Whatever you do with your pack once you have it is not my business any more...

I will always repair/replace any faulty cells etc. But if you burn your house down because you shorted the battery... that's your problem my friend üëçüèª

Not from Belgium and don't know EU/Belgian laws...but...

What if you made the customer send you a non-plagiarized overview of the "Risks" section of your terms of service before you would fulfill their order :rofl:

So, check out online, pay, but then until they email this to you, their order never is made...with full refund possible if they want

Anyway, just an idea

Hmm that is a good idea... so that they must sign a paper with risk etc by hand. But I don‚Äôt know if that is enough for the Dutch law. I hope some experts can tell me more.

Can't you just get them to digitally sign a waver on your website that absolves you of any responsibility once they receive the battery?

Genuine customers wouldn't be put off by this.

It means you're not responsible if they're not responsible with your battery, but it doesn't affect warranty/faults/repair etc. with fair use, that's still covered.

What you can do is: "don't charge inside. Don't charge without supervision. When issues, remove from power source and cover with sand"
That will cover the building issue. Most of the other suggestions won't work as even though the law is stupid, they will find that you are selling eskate batts (hence fi you can't say 'not for eskate use')

Now I only know about US laws, but here I am using an LLC to protect myself. With the small quantity of boards I am going to produce, product liability insurance is just too expensive and doesn‚Äôt make sense.

Instead, I use an LLC so if there is a lawsuit, they can only sue the LLC. Sure this would result in my board business LLC going bankrupt, but at least my personal finances are safe.

That is something I can do.
But the problem is that such a singature or text is not enough for the belgium law... :/

I understand, That is a very good thing for your personal finances. Unfortunately we don't have LLC here in Belgium.

Can you not test all products befor shipment AND keep a record of results for 3 years that‚Äôs how the installation industry works.

We also have to have calibration results of testers going back as prof of ongoing matinance. Written proceed-as of how to do things.

I‚Äôm guessing stress tests of high load and bursts with a befor and after check on health of the battery and temps

Prof your welds/materials/insulation/storage is suficant for the job at the time of distribution. Instructions on safe use and risks with a disclaimer saying failya to follow instructions can cause xyz. I‚Äôm guessing that‚Äôs how most company‚Äôs sell things. That paper manual thing in the box no one reads.

Spell checker not working so get over bad spelling or don‚Äôt read it.

Edit and a death date (even salt has a use by dateü§™)

I think the best way to protect your self from this kind of stuff is to advertise our batteries as "for bench use only" so using it in a skateboard is not the products purpose and maybe even misuse 
Because we dont know how much abuse our batteries will take

Hi Acido, 

I know that, I have called some company‚Äôs who helps to protect businesses. There was one company who had a claim against them. It was a Li ion pack that started a fire in a big storehouse. The battery was sold as benchmark/advertising purposes. It was laying in a room for showing it to the buyers. this claim has been before the court for 2 years now and probably will never be resolved. 

At this moment I am working on battery like hobby. So I tell each costumer that I am a hobbyist and not liable for any faults. 

I am also thinking off taking a small break with building packs. I am waiting on my goverment (Belgium) accepting a new law about starting a business. 
If the new law is accepted, I was thinking of starting a small kick start project. I like Samsung 30q so all packs would have that. I was thinking off 10s3p (single layer cells), 10s4p (single or dual layer cells), 12s4p (single or dual layer cells) with a 60-80A bms with e switch. 
If there is interest in such a kick start project and I can start my own business (at this moment it cost me 18500 euro to start a business, that is excluding notary costs & insurance & materials)
With the new law I have the possibility to start a company for 5000 euro that is excluding notary costs & insurance & materials. 

if I have the opportunity to reduce costs through a kickstart project, I will definitely do that. This business is also completely appart of my name. So each problem is for the business itself.

Dealing with product liability is ongoing and everlasting issue.
In DIY world 99,99% of people ride stuff hard and know even if it breaks it simply needs to be replaced. Good stuff breaks sometimes. Injuries happen. If quality of some maker/company/etc  is subpar (which clearly do not apply to you) it will soon be known and consumers simply wont come. With those 99,99% worst that can happen is you will have to refund when you mees up really bad (eg. cheap chinese vesc clones).
Imagine you got scammed yourself and welded pack out of bad cells.
Problem is with 0,01% of people who think "i know i messed up myself but i can go to court and squeeze some cash out of that bloke anyway", which is new way of living/thinking coming to europe from USA (sorry US guys but this is how i see it, my personal opinion). Consumer at McDonald spilled hot coffee on his leg and sued restaurant for his own stupidity, bencause warning label on a cup wasnt visible good enough for him. And won.
When you do crazy enough stuff you get companies telling you to get lost simply bencause they fear the liability of making something unusual for you, despite having knowledge and power to do it.
I myself make some unusual stuff for other people/companies and time will come for me to win jackpot in a lottery and hit 0,01% chance of getting one-way ticket to court.
With ongoing trend it is only a matter of time, be it days or decades.
**This knowledge doesnt stop me from doing what i love and feel is right, despite some men in black suits telling everyone otherwise.**
When a kid chased you around the park and when finally caught up asked: "Hey, this board is super cool, can i try it?" who would say no - i would let him, even if just for a moment. This is what makes you liable for the kid. 99,99% of the kids will return shortly with their cheeks red from overwhelming joy, but one of them will crash deliberately just to get you to court, just as momma/papa told him to do. Welcome to reality.
Decision is yours to make, hope you make it a good one for everyone of us. We need those packs made by someone who knows what he is doing and cares about customers.
Cheers!

Thanks for you message! I only try to give my costumers the best packs. If something breaks and it isn't them fault, I have no problem with repairing that one on my own cost.

The most important thing for me is that I don't want to sell everything I have, because something went wrong with a battery pack. If I am working with the title of company that cost me 18000euro's. The case about the battery is between the costumer and the company and not against me as person.

My decision is already made, I am going to start a company but first I go wait until Belgium accept the new law. Paying 5000euro to start a company is just ok for me, But me as student paying 18000 euros for a company, that is a bit too much.

Just out of pure curiosity - how long i would have to persuade you to weld me a pack for my buid? https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/the-overkill-4wd-36kw-20s13p-100-mph-build-from-scratch/81410
I had to persuade manager of only company out of 5 inquired  that seriously considered making it  for me  for over 3 weeks (calling like everyday) and i count 3 weeks from date they recieved cells from me by freight services. Finally took 6 weeks for me to recieve the pack, and they did not solder the supplied wiring to be certain that i made modifications to the pack myself.

If I had some time free. So no other orders before you.  I could easy done it in a week. I would also cut the sharp pieces of the nickel, add fishpaper on those positive side‚Äôs of the battery & even add copper braid for a higher amperage. 


But I always tell my customers about the waiting time if I have multiple orders. I am just a normal student so I also have to go to class and study.
