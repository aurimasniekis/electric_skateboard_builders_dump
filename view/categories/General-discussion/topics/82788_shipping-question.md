I'm not sure that will work, he wants to send a board from the UK to Australia.

@B-b-q-tom will the board have a battery installed when you send it?

In that case you will need someone who can do dangerous goods shipments, and the board will go either sea or on a cargo only aircraft.

Most shippers will have a member of staff who is licensed to do that so it should not be a problem but make sure you let them know the package contains a device with a li-ion pack installed and the watt hour of the pack or you could be in for a world of pain
