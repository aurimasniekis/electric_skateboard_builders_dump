Sadly they haven't donated. They also never said a word to me. First time I hear about it.

Nha it's maytech... so I'm pretty sure it's @Ackmaniac firmware... probably because they are in cold with trampa and vedder regarding the Trademark. No wonder why they are ban from the forum ðŸ˜‰

I've been contacted by Maytech and this was a mistake apparently. 
I guess the firmware is the same as it was before.
