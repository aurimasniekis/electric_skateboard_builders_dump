Something I don't see get talked about all too much on here are pavement types. I'm sure a seasoned longboarder would know how different roads handle and what is/isn't safe to ride. But for a greenhorn like myself, I tend to test the limits of what's safe. 

Long story short, I trusted a turn a little too much and paid for it. I made a sharp left turn (regular style) on 97mm 78A duro wheels on shitty worn asphault and traction gave way causing me to lose balance and slam to the ground. No broken bones and nothing I won't heal from, but it cost me a nice ding on my phone, a big gash on my remote, a hole in my hoodie, and some blood.

Stay safe!

These wrist guards don't get in the way of holding the remote and will save your wrists and palms.

what do you guys think of this: https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B003EB1S1W/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1

Won't the fingerless kind be better so you could hold the remote more comfortably?

Thx @Namasaki I've been looking for wrist protection that doesn't get in the way of the remote.

I have those bought for my eMTB, just waiting for new ESC to use instead of VESC in my eMTB. It has 2 splints one on palmside, second on the opposite, it's really decently made glove. I had broken my wrist snowboarding few years back, and as I want to avoid it happening again I use wrist guards , as my eMTB has bindings the risk is similar so I decided to use it too.

You can find them on Muirskate and on Amazon.  For example: https://www.muirskate.com/longboard/safety%20pads/70591/187-wrist-guards

The sizing is the circumference around your wrist.

I was checking on Amazon last night too for wrist guards and I think the Dakine one is a better buy. Thanks to this thread, I'm reconsidering getting full gloves now that fall/winter is coming and that's when I'll do most of my riding.

I was going to suggest just wearing some light motorbike gloves like @Photorph suggested...

However I feel his gloves are a bit overboard, they are a bit bulky and made for crashing at speeds over 100 km/h, plus that price tag!

something like this would be more than enough for a longboard:

or even

It's a lot more expensive in Canadian dollars. This Dakine one has a lot more positive reviews on the USA Amazon site.  I live next to a big Amazon shipping factory in Texas. It'll get cool, but won't snow until February/March, IF EVEN.

The only thing is those gloves  you recommended don't have wrist impact protection.  

The gloves I have look bulky, but if they fit you well they are actually pretty functional.   But the fit really has to be perfect.

Your gloves are definitely better and offer more protection, of course. If people have the money to spend they should obviously go for something better. 

At the same time, there was some light padding on the inside of the palm in the gloves I suggested and a bit of wrist support, however you really shouldn't be falling on your wrists anyway...

I was just saying that if you have a tighter budget you can get some really nice gloves from motorbike stores at around $20 that will be so much better than wearing nothing at all.

Ive fallen off my motorbike several times and even the thinner stuff really save your hands! 

I guess what I wanted to really say is, have a look at motorbike shops too, even go into one and try some gloves on, you can find things for every budget, weather and protection level!

For sure, i need to get them anyway because my hands are freezing by the time i get to my train. I probably won't use guards though.

  I know this is an old thread, but it is still really important. Last night I stumbled onto this thread and was inspired to invest in some new gloves and pads, as I will always ride my esk8 with safety gear when it arrives in a couple weeks. 

  Tonight I decided to ride my penny home from work and ate it when I thought I could slow myself with a wide carve and the rear wheels slid out. I had no gloves or pads or helmet on. It is good that I know how to fall correctly, but in the split second before I connected with the payment, I instinctually put my hands out. I touched the asphalt for all of an instant but it was enough to skin both of my palms slightly, and put a hole in my jacket and my pants. This can/will never happen again.

  Let me tell you, the impact, the sudden momentary loss of breath, and even the blood does not suck as much as having to tweeze bits of rock and dirt out from under the skin on your palms where it got jammed.

  I will never ride again (esk8 or downhill) without pads or gloves.

I bought helmet, wrist guards, knee and elbow pads, all from triple 8. Promised myself I would never ride without them. And I haven't!  However I took a spill 2 weeks ago and hit my hip.

Thanks @smurf! They seem pretty bad ass. Just thought I'd throw in a little extra protection!

Yeah I have a few holes in my hands, and my elbow is skinned, but my hip hurts the worst out of all of them! Ha. I didn't know hip protection existed until I just saw your picture of the hillbillies.
