Ive been trying to decide what to do with this shit pack that was built for me.... its safe but just  so long that finding a longboard to pair it with is almost impossible and the cells could have been used. I dont feel right selling it and definitely not worth fixing.... so i think im using it to test out crazy shit!!! Gonna try ying yang mounts on it, different kv motors, and whatever ppl are interested in seeing for science... here is the shit battery... luckily i only paid 260 for this 10s5p![image|666x500](upload://AuELTZbDrYs7cOpbSr6hMop5Y7Z.jpeg)
