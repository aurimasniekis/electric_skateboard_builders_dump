We have make any tests, and making a short circuit.
We thinking the ESK8 Controller was dead!
We thinking ok, after this was the DRV dead!
But no, the two ESK8 Controller was working without problems!

I don't really understand your post? What happened? You intentionally created a short circuit?

I think what he tries to explain is, that he pushes his new controller to the max to see what happens.

and the only thing that happend is a dead capacitor

With the first controller it was accidental short circuit
but it was interesting to note that the controller still works
and the DRV was no dead.
Yes the capacitor was dead, and the ESK8 Controller was working.
