Well guys, perhaps some of you already know about this new esk8 manufacturer, but perhaps most don't. So here it is, may I present: from Portland, Oregon.... [Hoyt St Electric Skate](https://www.hoytskate.com/). 

![image|690x388](upload://jJORgPUuFmpJeQ7Ja1CM6Ggt8FE.jpg)

As of august 2018 Hoyt St is offering tree electric longboards: DV-8, SKINN and STARS models. All their designs are limited editions and will be seasonally updated with fresh graphics. Users can customize their finish with Skinn, choosing between bonded glass gripped or no-grip, pure bamboo options.

Among some of their most distinctive features are:

* The unique Puck remote control which is engineered with proprietary and patented radio control technology for supreme connectivity.

* Quick swap battery modules, a built-in battery protection system with Samsung INR 18650 25R lithium ion cells. High discharge cells encased in a protective dampening shell to withstand vibration and shock. Also meets FAA air travel regulations as a carry-on item.

* Customized Dual Motors built in collaboration with a US brushless motor company, supplier for the US military. Each motor produces 2200 watts and is constructed with high-grade Japanese 0.2mm silicon steel laminatations and polyimide ultra-high temp (240C) windings.

* Bamboo DuoDeck locally manufactured in Portland, Oregon with integrated rough-sawn and laminate construction with 100% bamboo. Designed with a sculpted concave and nose/tail drops. A subtle kicktail nestles the motors within 5mm of the truck's baseplate.

* Anodized CNC 6160 aluminum Motor Mounts designed with spring-loaded auto-belt tensioners and black alloy steel screws and motor pulley caps.

* Zoobomb 97mm Urethane Wheels with stone ground 52mm contact patch. Tree versions in 85-90% rebound with 75A to 78A hardness.

**Performance Specs**:

Looking good!
Specs and workmanship looking good too!
3 Packs of 10s1p 25r up to a 10s3p is clever.

We need to get this Deck seperatly i guess!

Always cool to see more players joining the game with some good stuff.

Is this yours @pixelsilva, a friend or something or did you just stumbled across?

Do the batteries connect and become one big battery or do you swap them one at a time?
How do the batteries connect?

A company from my neck of the woods....
Those mounts look great.
Without precision-made everything is on this board I would have liked to see some of the Precision trucks.
Think it's funny they named the wheels zoobomb seeing no one gets to bomb it really anymore.

US duh! I would get laser cut grip and designs. With CF and Bamboo deck I want that material to show. Maybe just put some grip in the front and back? I also imagine our fellow butt boarder would appreciate not ripping up his pants.

That mount with the rounded edges are so nice. 

On another note. Am I the only one that... for a split second see "Holy Shit" when I look at their logo?

Dam, what a flippin bummer! Someone on here needs to add the spring loaded tension idlers thing to some of the motor mounts that people have already designed. Love the idlers, but would be cool to not have to ever adjust them by hand cause those little screws and especially the nuts on the inside of the mount can be a pain!

Anyone want to volunteer....? I am a buyer.... lol. Wish I knew how to build some or I'd do it myself

Did anyone ever get answers on the batteries, combine for 10s3p seems possible, how do they connect and charge, able to use with a DIY build?

Anyone have a good contact there or on forum?

Thanks!
