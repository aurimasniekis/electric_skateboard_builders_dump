Since I'm here for quite a while now, I've seen some broken mechanical parts, burned btteries and fried electrical components.
Wouldn't it be nice to honor the fallen on our way to perfection?
I start with a common one:
Blown DRV chip on the VESC :frowning:

how the heck did you kill all those motors?   I have a tacon 160 last nearly 2000 miles (and still going)  on a friction drive e-bike.   I understand eboards are different than ebikes but still that's a lot of dead motors.

```
It was ^^, on my current first build I have a 6S setup running smoothly on FOC with esk8.de VESC and sensored 6374 motor. To configure it I ran motor + sensor detection and left the other FOC parameters as default... I thought I could do the same thing with Enertion's VESC + the RSPEC 6372 on my new 10S setup but that wasn't the case, the VESC caught fire after about 5 min, I should have monitored temperatures more frequently (opening and closing the enclosure takes time, and I was too amazed by the new build I just wanted to ride, I didn't expect the VESC to fail so suddenly :/ ) - Luckily I ordered 2 VESCS so now I'm running one (with the clear wrap tape instead of the black one) in BLDC, I don't think I will switch to FOC with the RSPEC again soon unfortunately, unless somebody has a good FOC configuration for the 6372 and/or good tips on how to prevent failures... my enclosure now smells of burned PCB but at least I learned something  :D

edit: probably the default FOC VESC settings on the esk8.de one are better? Maybe I can try to export them via the XML file feature and import them into the Enertion VESC?

edit2: maybe it was a current problem coming from the battery? like a voltage drop that caused a spike in current (amp) draw? If that was the case probably a fuse between the battery and the vesc could have helped, the DRV is the chip that drives mosfets  so ... I don't know... probably - I was using the anti-spark XT-90 key for switching on and od
ff the circuit. If I had the anti spark switch like in the other board (got it from esk8.de too but) probably this would not have happened

Sanded down two dead DRV chips to see the die. The right one died 'normally'. The left one died spectacularly, melting the silicon die, blowing up 4 FETs and vaporizing some PCB traces...

the DRV isnt the problem - the components around the DRV and the settings are the problems.

Got water in my VESC today by riding in light rain. It works for a couple of seconds and then reboots. Gonna try to dry it out a bit by the exhaust from my oven while cooking supper. Fingers crossed.
