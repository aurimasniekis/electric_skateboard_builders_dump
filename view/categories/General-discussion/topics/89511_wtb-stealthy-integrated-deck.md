hi

I'm searching for a integrated deck, that:

* doesn't look like it has an enclosure in it (max stealth)
* fits a unity
* fits at least 110mm wheels
* (has waterprotection)
* is actually buyable (also interested if something releases withing the next month)
```

or a riser with light, power switch and charging port - but would like to have this mounted on top of the deck

There's always this if you want to drop 750 clams on an overpriced deck
