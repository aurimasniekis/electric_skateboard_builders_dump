Today while I was selling my time for food and a roof over my head I encountered an office manager who was really "fascinated" by my board. So of course I said she could have a go, I suggested the nearby park but a phobia of birds meant that she decided inside the office was the best place.

So after the usual briefing I gave her the remote, it all went very well for about 30 secs, then she moved her finger to try to brake in the wrong direction and the board shot off across the room, hit a cabinet, toppled a cabinet and sent the plants on top of the cabinet flying across the room.

The office manager who had cat like reflexes was completely unharmed, as were the plants and the cabinet after they were rescued from the floor. Despite the result the entire office agreed this was an entirely valid experiment and was to be encouraged - I like these people and I think I would definitely work with them again.

There is CCTV footage but the file they gave me was corrupted. I am going to send an email on monday and see if I can get an MP4 that will play and post it.

If you can't get the footage I expect you repeat the experiment under same circumstances but with a bunch of gopros strategically positioned. 
Swap the plants for plastic ones...poor things

I really hope I can get a non corrupted version, there were at least 15 people in absolute hysterics watching it back on the head of HR's monitor (myself included), the best bit is the entire mezzanine floor jumping up from their desks to see what had happened downstairs.

I was testing my board indoors, and forgot that its like a boosted trigger, when im not moving, and push the throttle back to brake, it goes in reverse. It broke through the drywall. Havent told my parents yet... :frowning:

This happened 6 months ago, dont ask how i managed to cover it up :)

Hahaha good read man! Coworker also wanted to try my Trampa, went well until he decided to test the brakes by just going a little faster first (that's why you have brakes right?). It stopped, instantly and launched backwards. He went flying and almost drove the board through the window.

I shattered two glass doors in college because of runaways. My skateboard's kicktail just cleans the metal frame right into the glass. Glad these were before cameras were installed all over campus

I also have a story about why we should not play with esk8 inside:

So i ride to work. I usually unplug my loopkey outside before i entered the office but today someone started to ask me questions about my board, which disrupted my normal flow. I put my remote in my front hoodie pocket while i chatted with them and entered through the front lobby. 

Its important to note at this point that our office is made from floor to ceiling glass on the outside walls. 

So i get to the area with all the desks and meeting tables. I set my board down and start removing my helmet gloves and gear. Some one calls me into one of the labs to help them lift something. I go to help, unaware i have left an armed time bomb at my desk. In the lab i bend over to grab the box, forgetting that the remote is still in my front hoodie pocket. 

Suddenly I hear the loud screech of thane on the smooth office floor as my dual drive trampa delivers everything its got. The board instantly shoots across the office like a 6kw cruse missile. I couldn't see from where i was stood so i could only hope it wouldn't end badly. It felt like eternity before i finally heard a loud *CRASH*. I stepped out of the lab to see everyone else stood at there desks and meeting tables looking at what had happened. There i was, remote in hand, board upside down half way down the office, lipo's and bits of enclosure spread across the floor. I had to walk across the office and pick up all the pieces of my board an my pride :frowning: 

The only good part of this is that it seems the board grazed past a wall and managed to flip its self over,  ending the incident without hurting anyone and avoiding all of the insanely expensive glass.

LESSON LEARNED: never have your board and remote powered up indoors at the same time.
