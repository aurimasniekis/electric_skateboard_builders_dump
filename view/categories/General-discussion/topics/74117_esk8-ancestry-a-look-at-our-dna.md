This tread will be used to post and debate about those ancient skateboard & longboard developments forgotten long ago. 'Archeological' discoveries found by eboarders in old magazines, catalogs, posters, photographs, adds, tv comercials, movies, video or any other type of advertising campaign. A look at our hobby's past before it became what it is today.

Does anyone remember a Kickstarter called halftone or dualtone wheels. They were supposed to have 2 duros for each wheel.

No where does it say they're two duro wheels. Two color wheels but not duro. Especially if they are designed for sliding. There is no benefits to two duro in one wheel.

Two duro wheels would actually benefit for more grip in pretty much every situation where you wanna limit rolling resistance, for electric board it'd be acceleration, braking and corners. It also helps eating road bumps. 

It's been used for at least a decade in inline skating and F1 race cars.

Edit : Note that there is a wide array of choices today including rubber tyres so... Apart from specific cases it may be not be super relevant for Longboards. I'd like to see a test.

I looked, they were only from 2011/2012. Nothing too nostalgic in them like I remembered. Unfortunately either I wasn't subscribed to any magazines or there weren't really any magazines back around when Abec 11 Grippins came out. Those are the day's I am particularly nostalgic about.

I can't help but think of Skate Muties From The 5th Dimension zine when I think of sk8 ancestry
(I guess I'm the only one here who remembers SM5D? UK Bristol I think produced Zine in the 80s)

Something like this you can find for roller-skates. They have wheels with different duro in one.
