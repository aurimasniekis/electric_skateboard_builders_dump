Hey Guys,
I just talked to [V-Belt Guys](https://www.vbeltguys.com/discount/eSk8). I have had a great experience getting belts from them in all sizes (for a great price).  I told them about the forum, and the groups, and they are offering a 15% discount on all belt orders.  Stock up!

Discount Code: eSk8

Use the "Search it!" to find your belt (ie. 345-5m-15) 
NOTE: If you use the link provided you should see the code automatically applied on the checkout page.

He said the code was active now, and I checked that it is (as of 04/25/19 10am MST).
He did not say how long it would be active.  Just an FYI.
