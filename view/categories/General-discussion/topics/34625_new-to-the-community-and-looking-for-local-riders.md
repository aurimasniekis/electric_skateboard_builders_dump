Hello, Im fairly new to this community and just really want to meet any Seattle locals that also esk8. It can get lonely at the top of the bike trail food-chain... Currently working on my first builds as well and would love to show them off when theyre done. First build is a 37" downhill deck, 12s2p DIYes battery and enclosure, 44 degree caliber 2 trucks, 83mm evolve wheels (they were laying around), DIYes V4 motor mount, FOCBOX Vesc and 170Kv Maytech sealed/sensored motor. My other project is a custom chopper scooter with 800w motor/controller, 10s5p bike battery, Mongoose 12" frame body, rear disc brakes and lots of custom pieces to make it come together :)

Im.concerned your 12S2P will sag really hard with all the hills in downtown Seattle.  You'd be styling with his 12S3 or 4P pack ðŸ‘Œ. Are u pretty light weight? Those are some serious hills ðŸ˜«
