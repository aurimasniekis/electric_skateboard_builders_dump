November 27 last year, no?  ...is a joke, right?  ...142 days of delivery delay!! That company should reimburse its costumers for such an outrage.

....meanwhile, somewhere in Fantasyland another victim awaiting delivery...

Never got the money clip even after opening a ticket about it @CarlCollins

A coin purse may be better right now :sweat_smile:

In total I have 8 FocBoxes and way too many working boards. I‚Äôm just sad that one died when all I did was detect motor and gave it a few small throttle just to check direction. ESCapes from now on.

Yeah I posted here. The first post has the fault. A picture or the FocBox in at the bottom. Visually it doesn‚Äôt really look like anything blew. 

It‚Äôs on its way to @ThermalM16 in Florida so he can check it out to see if DRV needs to be replaced.

I wonder if this pack can do 80a... @barajabali have you had a look inside? xt60 on the business end.

It can but if you‚Äôre going to continually pull 80 amps I would reinforce the welds

Our packs have a 60 amp fuse on them (on the r2)

@Lionpuncher

The customers which haven't received their money clips can email to support@enertionboards.com with their cyber monday order ID. So we will ship the money clip to then like we are doing now. :slight_smile:

Update, one of my 5 focboxes in this order had the film on the thermal pad. 3 of them had the pad out of position, partial coverage of the bottom fets. Check your focboxes!

The nano-x auto binds. You don't need a key. Turn on the remote first, then full throttle and full brake, and then turn on your board. You'll see the green light go from flashing green to solid green.
