Awesome, I was going to ask about motor size... belt width... but it was all too hard. Too many variables. Thanks bro

Takes like 5-10 secs to adjust belt tension but I'd at least check it once a month or every 2 weeks. Checking it is as simple as just squeezing the belt to check how "loose" it is.

Thanks TB (@torqueboards), I'm familiar with the process. I'm about to mount up some _"different"_ motors that will require  me to partially disassemble my motor mount to adjust both my motors and support bearings to adjust my belts. So before get my self in a hole I'm just doing a [SWOT analysis](https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newTMC_05.htm) of the design to make sure it is viable :wink: so I thought I would sound out the community for there experience as a search yielded me no solid data.

Hey, I have a hard enough time remembering what day it is let alone the last time I adjusted my belts
:confused:

BTW, is it Friday yet?

As for the poll maybe I could have defined things better but for the sake of others that might search this out later... if you select other, other than each ride, other than each week, other than each month, other than each 3 months or other than each 6 months, you look like you are voting for a time period longer than 6 months... just saying :expressionless:

unless you are implying you adjust your belts more often than every ride... :fearful:
