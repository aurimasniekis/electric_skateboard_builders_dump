Alright, I know this is disastrously off topic from Es8, but why not? I have so much fun on here, and due to the nerdy nature of this forum, I figure there must be a few of you on here who also like to **watch anime**. If not, why the hell did you click on this topic?
So I think it would be cool while I’m on the ole **PC** and **watchin MCs** blastin’ bad guys to also be having a discussion about all of our recent **binge watches**, or upcoming esk8 trends, or whatever beer I’m drinking tonight, or whatever.
So here is my thought, if you **watch anime** and think it would be cool to link up with other people from the forum come here and post some thing like this:

**My Discord Tag:** (include your Discord number)

**MY WAIFU:**

**TRASH I WATCH:**


For me:

**My Discord Tag:** XXBrainXChildXX #1916

**MY WAIFU:** Megumin from Konosuba

**TRASH I WATCH:** Anything Ghibli, Cowboy Bebop, One Punch Man, Madoka Magica, Konosuba, Psycho Pass

Somebody hit me up, share your tag, **bash other's waifu**, or let the community what you like to **watch** when you’re not building bad ass Electric Skateboards.

I watch "a little" right now. I have no time to watch all I want.
I watched a really big ammount of series and movies long time ago.
Back in my 20's I was a member of several fansub teams. I used to be the encoder. It was a really nice part of my life. 
I guess my top ten looks like this:
One piece
Dragon ball
Lupin the third
Neon genesis evangelion
Naruto
Bleach
Inuyasha
Cowboy bebop 
Haha o Tazunete Sanzen Ri (marco)
Chobits 
Of course I loved many other series but those are unbeatable.

I have to assume you  have seen classics like Akira, second mention for Neon Genesis Evangelion and Cowboy Bebop, Berserk (very gory towards the end with is a rape scene; I kid you not), Fist of The North Star, Escaflowne, FCLC, any film by Miyazaki, Gundam, Dragon Ball, Ghost in The Shell, +1 for The Big O, Samurai Jack, Samurai Champloo, Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood, Escaflowne, Trigun, Yu Yu Hakusho, Space Battleship Yamato, +1 for Last Exile,

Semi classic/going to be: Captain Harlock, 
Weird but gory: Blood C

Recent: Anime Film "Your Name"

Ongoing: Digimon Adventure Tri, Fairy Tail, My Hero Academy, Dragon Ball Super
The remake of Berserk in CGI give me an OCD, ex. the frame rate seems to be slower than the older version, but more like what is in the manga.

I don't know much about this season but Steins;gate is pretty darn amazing, gave me a good nice mind fucking and Re;zero is quite nice too. That also goes for Charlotte, FMA brotherhood, My Hero Academia, and a bunch of other stuff that I dont remember

Watched way too much anime 100+ shows

Great post and guilty as charged   :slight_smile:  ; life-long fan starting with Battle of the Planets right here lol: https://youtu.be/fDasuAc9GNA?t=12s

presently re-watching last year's 'your name' which, in my opinion, best represents the future of commercial Japanese animation:

I had a couple stickers my friend designed like 2 years ago but I have no idea where they went.
I had one on my phone and then I had to get my phone replaced and I lost the one sticker that I actually liked.

the recent Star Blazers (remake) really made my week.  I was glued to the originals as a kid and this remake treats the source content with great respect and typical Japanese precision (I was told producers hired the original vocalists' son for the theme song and used all 1970s analog synths to re-create each sound effect).

Dungeon ni Deai wo Motomeru no wa Machigatteiru Darou ka (Is It Wrong to Try to Hit On Girls in a Dungeon) had me in tears laughing the other day lol

I ain’t gonna lie, that storyline with little girl chimera got some tears out of me. Got into anime with DBZ, Saint seya, Hokuto shin ken, city hunter etc and at the time I would never have thought those cartoons could be so seriously emotional.

By the way, @Deckoz your tattoo is the one scar has on his arm in FMA, right?

Yes, there are some difference but it may depend on the artist and on how drunk he was when it happened. Lol
 There are some really hardcore fans out there but that tattoos and symbols in mangas are actually pretty cool.
The funniest is that I know kids who were named Sangoku and Sangohan.
