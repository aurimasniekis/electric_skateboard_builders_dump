P.S- Plus I would never dig so low as to eboarders not being skaters. That's just low self esteem. What he doesn't know (from what is seems like) is that skateboarding started way before his time. Ollie's and kickflips didn't matter. :slight_smile:

Easy to say when your board only goes 18mph.

Some of our boards go 40+

There's always someone thats gonna say "that's not real skateboarding". Every time people find a mew way to skate. It's fucking retarded...... get over yourself.  You're not some skate god.

I've been skating for 25 years @Sowdal. I can do a kickflip. But that's beginner shit. Ollie's are cool too, but I leave those for the people that brag about them. ;)

I do know that when I show up to skateparks, the real "skaters" end up on their ass when I let them try my boards. I laugh and then 360 flip over their dumb bodies as I scream "skate or die dickhead". Then I hit a ledge and leave for then next run. 

By the way, what's your point here? Too much skate blood in you to read what forum you're in. Basic 3rd grade reading level would tell you this is an eboard forum. Not a self help group where we get to play the "you're a pussy... No you're a pussy" game. Lick my butthole dickhead. :slight_smile:

Hey dimwit, why would I want to go faster than 20 mph on a street deck?  I actually push when I skate to save battery.   Let's see what you "ride" on.  I bet it tries to look good but is constantly defective, like its owner.

Hahaha is that supposed to 1up me?  One of them looks worse than mine.  How do those dual motors feel when they scrape against the concrete?  Oh, wait, I guess you don't have a tail or nose on those decks.  You might as well have just mounted the equipment on a surfboard or piece of 2x4.  Your gear is bunk son.  Rock the helmet all you want, it's a good look for you guys.

I knew you would pussy out and ban my account you little fuck. You’re probably tweaking out right now trying to figure out how to make a 18650 powered butane torch for that bong pizzo aren’t ya? hahaha

I’m not going to tell you exactly what it was that made me certain that you are a crystal methamphetamine user. It will keep you guessing. I just hope you’re not that obvious about it in public. It’ll just be our little secret… p.s. stop picking at those damn sores! It only makes it worse!!

I can't speak for @Skunk but "you're a fag tweaker" is the most bigoted dinosaur thing to say...Like I just want you to know that that's offensive not on a personal level to the person you directed it toward, but toward an entire minority that's been historically oppressed with usage of the word "fag".  Hence someone else calling you a racist.  Because even though you haven't said anything "racist" yet, you've displayed symptoms of the exact same mechanism and types of thinking.  I don't want to hate you for saying shit like that, but incase you were inaware like, someone needs to tell you how your language and speech is offensive on a global scale.
