Sup guys,
Didn't want to make a thread on this but I did anyway. 
I haven't been active in the last 2 weeks. I moved out of my parents house which hosted my shop. Needless to say, I have been busy as I work 7 days between 2 jobs, moving homes, being an Enertion service agent, keeping my fiancé happy and still managing to get my Chiboards orders out. 
As of right now, my little gig is up in the air. I have millions of messages to respond to and if I missed you, please hit me back up.

Hey all the best to you. Family and well being come first. 
Take some time to breath and enjoy the things life gives back when you work hard.

Take some time off until you’ve got the free time to get ChiBoards back up and running smoothly.  Family first :)

best of luck my friend!  hope everything settles down into a new and comfortable routine.  That's a lot of moving parts - you definitely should find time to take a break and breathe!  Vacation or staycation - gotta make time for the important things (yourself, family, loved ones!)
