I always check my motors before I install.

I look for failure points... Especially the grub nuts

As I was removing and inspecting the tiny bolts I noticed a tiny piece of the thin walled grub nut broke and fell into motor bell housing ...needed to take the entire thing apart...since the tiny piece got sucked into the bell housing...

Heading to get some proper bolts to secure it.

Check your motors

That's why I like replacing them for M3/M4 Socket Cap Bolts if you can. :grin:
