I know there are people who are just haters, there always is - but have you seen anyone not like eskating even after trying to ride?

My wife hates it.  I have tried on multiple occasions, its a non starter.  She cant get used to balancing, but to be honest she trips over air on a regular basis, so...

My friend tried my wowgo and instantly fell off even after multiple warnings to be "easy on the trigger". 

Fair to say he didn't like it.

Did the same thing for my first build that I just finished up last week. Worth every penny. 12/10 would do it again.

Maner my wife's a natural born klutz too. She got on my board once while holding my hand for balance.  Looked at me with pure fear and said **oh no!** it was hysterical

There's a guy in baesk8 who seemed to have never enjoyed his or any other board. Opted for a scooter instead.
