So as most of you guy know TB sent out replacement clamps for all those having issues with their current ones... Now im a bit confused about the shape of the new Clamp and the contents of the bag haha... 

Can anyone else figure out how to make these work >_>

Uhm, flipping one of the clamp parts doesnt work? I think the black thing is a shrink tube thing to shrink on to the threaded part of the screws. So they dont vibrate loose?

I am not 100% sure, but i think you are supposed to shrink them on the threaded part of the screw, so they will act the same way as nylock nuts. @torqueboards should know?

They told me it was to place in between the hanger and the clamp to fill in any empty space. I did not use them and the clamp did bite down and grip the truck properly so there is no movement and the mounts are easy to center, no more cock eyed mounts lol

This set up is the best set up so far, for my set up though I would need longer screws and spacers to make the idlers work they don't stick out far enough for my set up.

I use shrink tube just like that on the old mounts.  A peice goes between clamp and the hangar on the hangar faces opposite from the motors. 

It seems they wouldn't really be needed anymore with these new clamps, but they couldn't hurt to cut long ways to open up the tube, wrap the shrink around the hangar where you are going to put the clamps so each tube opens up to line up with two faces on the hangar matching half a clamp each and clamp down over the shrink tube. They might stay on tighter this way due to the resistance of them pushing out on the clamp instead of bare metal to metal, and even provide a bit of damping for the vibrations through the mounts to the motors because of this small bit of extra resistance.

I can't imagine these are to shrink onto the screws.... Just use some blue loctite and let it cure after torquing down the clamps... Assuming these clamps are threaded.

Also, props to @torqueboards for great customer service following up like this with customers having issues with products.

It's actually better for CA folks.. no sales tax :) Shipping is the same either way too.

**Heatshrink** is used to closed the gap for 180mm trucks or 218mm trucks if the motor mount holes don't line up properly for the motor mount. This is because the top & bottom part of the clamp both have bolt holes for the motor mount. You don't typically need it but it's there if you do.

Hey Torquey, remember to send me the little single grub screw missing (from the four that should come) with the Clamp for the 63 mm Reversed Mount. I'll remaind you again in the near future so you can include the little thing with my next order. I already installed the clamp and all but is not definitive because I'm awainting batteries, enclosure and other enchilada to finish that build (Mjolnir Pintail 40"). So is not urgent for now. (just to remaind you on that one). Cheers Bro. :grinning::+1:

No competition. @alphamail is awesome.. I plan on using riptides for our precision trucks soon.

@Holyman92 - Still finalizing on pneumatics but mostly will be a 160x50 street and 180x50 all terrain tire.

**110x65 Samples..**
They are huge.. Will be black though with black cores. May have a second color option.

Is to late for suggestions @torqueboards? I'm still concerned about the chunking thing. Rounded lips are a must. To much square sharp angles and you could ruin the project. I like the 110mm x 65mm size though, way to go bro!! Key aspect here is to pay attention to costumers. Also, black wheels on black cores are a wise decision (from a starting point), non of that BS.... whites on whites :nauseated_face::face_vomiting: like somewhat they are not forgetting their skateboard heritage... c'mon dudes!!. Lack of creativity there (you other wheel manufacturers out there :face_with_raised_eyebrow:).

The other one thing (in my opinion) vital for the success of an esk8 wheel is to pair it with a robust sprocketed wheel pulley that anybody can buy from the SAME manufacturer. You need to come up with a sprocket wheel pulley along your 110mm wheel, or 'am afraid, you will only accomplish half the task. This is what ABEC and others did in the past (could not accomplish)... to provide a robust sprocket wheel pulley (an integral wheel pulley) not that stupid lego wheel pulley that you often see out there, made of multiple parts that you need to assemble like a puzzle... (pulley, retainer ring & six bolts) which almost always needs adjustments and twitching here and there, not properly balanced, etc. 

If you come up with an integral aluminum sprocket wheel pulley for your 110mm wheel, you will do a killing!! So far NOBODY (well, almost nobody, except Ollinboards) has come with a complete package like that, and that is the reason we are still almost 7 or 8 years into this hobby and still looking to close the gap in many areas left unattended and without a valid solution. 

So kudos to you @torqueboards :+1::+1: Any more advice on this issue, from us costumers, don't hesitate.

....follow the money, and do it with style....:wink: :point_down:

@pixelsilva Yeah, will have a 36T/44T Pulley w/ a bearing for our 218mm Trucks. May move away from aluminum for the pulleys though.

The 110mm wheel will have a new rounded front lip and rounded lip on back side.

Great, man!! You are going in the right direction with rounded lips to avoid chunking. ABEC tried to cut angles (literally) by cutting off 11 mm of their succsesful 107mm to produce their new 90Â° sharp inside Superfly. The moment they started messing up with the original design the chunking nightmare appeared. Boa made it right straight up from the bat. Their wheels are all rounded lip outside/inside. So far, test riders haven't noticed no chunking with them at all.

You going black. That's playing smart. Don't go tutti frutti like Kegel or ABEC with their tropical carnival colors....green/orange core, orange/lime core, purple/green core, orange, pink, lime... that part of the color wheel chart been explored thoroughly. So please, for that other color you are thinking on, come up with something Nasty :sunglasses:. No more of that papaya festival. Non of that s... anymore. Become a furtive-carbon-stealth demon. Bring us some Batman-Lamborghini-USAF-Formula 1-racing type color thing.

One dark knight colored wheel example..... :point_down:

Looking forward to those 110s! I agree that the current wheel pulley system for esk8 isn't entirely optimized and it takes some time to balance the pulleys. A self-centering feature would be great.
