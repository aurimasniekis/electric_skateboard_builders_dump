**So things have been crazy at enertion HQ for the last two months!...** 

Growth has been incredible and our forecasting didn't account for the huge influx of orders we would receive... this has left us high & dry without much stock on the shelf..... I blame warm weather in the northern hemisphere &  @RunPlayBack for his awesome esk8 videos.

Of course, there have also been many other delays that got in the way of us shipping out in a timely manner... if you have been watching my vlogs you will know what i am talking about. 

To be 100% honest, I am actually ashamed of our service lately, it has been below average. We should have emailed you all individually and explained this situation but we literally ran out of the human resources required to effectively communicate with you all on an individual basis... 

I apologize for the bad service & promise you that we have learned from our mistakes.... As Dorothy states _"Toto, I've a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore."_


**The esk8 industry is about to explode in popularity!**


If you have placed and order for any of the parts listed below we are very sorry for not living up to our reputation of super fast worldwide delivery!  Please rest assured your order will be shipping soon.

**Below is a realistic summary of shipping dates**

_We are going to have a very busy few weeks ahead!  If you can't wait please email us asking for a refund. Otherwise please try to refrain from emailing us asking for delivery dates...we need to dedicate all our time to processing orders, this is the best info we have._

So wait, orders for raptors will start shipping at end of June?

I'm 2782, wondering where I fall.  I thought I was going to have everything shipped this week based on what you said on the forum last week.

@Photorph I have to be realistic man, my best business advice is under promise over deliver - I certainly haven't followed that rule lately due to unforeseen circumstances.......  I can't keep over promising. So now I am under promising. If you can't wait please email support@enertionboards.com and ask for a refund.

Actually I think your battery is on the way... so might be too late to refund that. I'll know at midnight tonight when I talk to my US distributor.

Also. Your raptor is sitting on the shelf 99% finished.... just waiting on vesc to arrive.

Can refund the raptor minus space cell.

@Photorph If you get the Raptor refund I'm sure someone will buy your space cell up quick (considering it should be delivered standalone mid-june for everyone else)

Thanks for being realistic @onloop. I don't mind waiting honestly since as you know I should hopefully have one board under my feet by the end of the month. The space in between will allow me to do a proper review of both as they come in. Hopefully you'll be able to over-deliver and we'll all be pleasantly surprised :)

I know, i know. you have told us all the time it will take some time.
I want to tell you that im not complaining as i know how much work it is to have your own company.
im from sweden and when i made the order i was planing to have a ride to play with this summer but as it looks now i will probably get the raptor in the end of the summer at the same point as the rain is starting and winter is coming here in september.
So im not going to be able to use the board until next summer around may and by then you will probably have a v2 of the raptor out.
This is an honest question: do you think i should ask for a refund and get back to you in february with an order instead OR keep in line and wait for it, hoping to be able to run it a few weeks?
Ordernr: #4110
Kind and understanding regards from Jesper.

Good effort @onloop this should help set expectations which should ease angst on both sides. To have a realistic dates is the way to go. 

I have a couple orders with you, but with regards to VESC coming in after the quoted dates, are you still able to fulfill the majority of VESC in July?  An order of say 4088 shouldn't be to far after the 12/7 right? 

Sorry you are probably going to have a few messages like this now.

@onloop Could you possibly delve into the reasons as to why the space cell is delayed another month? We've gotten a lot of info about the Vesc and that is frankly why I never requested a refund. For the space cell however, what are causes for the new delays? How confident are you in meeting your July 14 ship date?

they will be ready & shipped the end of the month, but if i tell you that level of accurate information and then for some random reasons there are delays you will all hate on me, so i added an extra two weeks to the ETA so i could surprise you with fast service - but now i have ruined the surprise.

You have my respect Jason. And for the people that are complaining, just know this, it's hard to manage a little business. Jason is running Enertion in a GARAGE, he started hiring people not so long ago. I'm studying to get my PR degree but i've been working in Marketing for 4 years, NO ONE (REALLY, NO ONE) could have guessed the growth Enertion had in the last months and there's a limit in what he can store in his GARAGE shelves and what his suppliers can actually deliver. Can't wait to get my hands on the SCP3 :smiley:

ROSE, the firmware loading & motor spin test rig finally operational.... fuck that took a while....  VESC should start flying out at a much faster rate.... 

I promise to all my customers who have been waiting patiently, the wait will be worth it.

Yes that is true but why keep letting the hundreds of orders come in if it is known that they cannot be shipped in a timely manner. No sign of "out of stock" or "backorder" in the enertion website really makes this situation worse for the customers in my opinion... 

Still I'm really happy i got a full refund and enertion was nice not taking the 20% fee. I want to thank you for that @onloop !

all the pre-order items have a future date saying when it is likely to ship by.... maybe i need to make it flash and use font size 100??

any of the other miscellaneous items that are out of stock like trucks, 12mm pulleys, motors all when out of stock by surprise....  i had plenty of stock on the shelf, then after one massive session of order packing stuff went out of stock....

so there where orders already in our system for stuff we didnt have..... we cant change that easily.

I suppose i could have refuned those orders and ask for people to reorder again when the stock (that was already on order) arrived in 2-3 weeks..... that would take hours & hours of admin work.

really there is a lot of stuff that i can do.... just need time & resources.

Up until 3 weeks ago i was a one man band.. every minute of the day was spent just trying to pack orders & reply to inbound emails.... doing all the other administrative stuff  didn't get done....

Yea sorry, i should have been more specific.. At least this was the case with mono drive r-spec pro+ kit which i ordered. And with all the transparency it felt like they didn't have such priority than space cells and raptors.

I wish u everything good in the future and hope you'll get this massive pile of orders out smoothly in the next few weeks.

I know you guys are super busy but I just wanted to check due to the fact that the order that my enclosure is part of has already been set as 'complete' in my account on your website so just wanted to make sure I'll get a tracking number when it's ready to ship.
My order number is 2121 but I can email your support team again if need be.

@onloop @EnertionSupport Now I'm really pissed off, and you know I always stood for you Jason. First, I assured that you could ship to Argentina, but now out of nowhere your staff is saying that you can't and straight give me a refund instead of giving me other alternatives (because I don't mind paying 100usd shipping, screw free shipping). I've been waiting for two months, got my motor, vesc, remote, and I even pressed my own deck, it's INSANE the amount of money and time I spent on this project. Not getting the space cell pro 3 forces me to sell all this stuff and i don't even know if I can, there's no market for this here. So, I'm hearing alternatives, prove that I wasn't wrong about you and Enertion. Order number 2916, but the refund has been made and I probably lost my place in the line of shipping.

[quote="hoochij4s, post:72, topic:4672"]
First, I assured that you could ship to Argentina, but now out of nowhere your staff is saying that you can't
[/quote]

Unfortunately, our ability to ship batteries into your country is not determined by us. Please rest assured I am more than happy to keep searching for new ways of doing getting it to you, just takes more time.

One option that worked with another customer in New Zealand was to send the space cell disassembled. he then built it himself. this might work for you too.

Regarding the refund, I don't believe we should have refunded you without asking/talking, this is an error made by my staff... I think i said something along the lines of "if we can't ship it the customer he will want/need a refund" my staff obviously took that statement as an instruction to refund you on the spot.

I am sorry, I am still training my staff.

We can work on this tomorrow. Don't worry I have enough stock of the Space Cell Pro's

@onloop Yeah, I don't mind if it's assembled or not. I can work that out, even paying around extra 100-150 US dollars for a private shipping alternative seems fine by me. I know you are being honest with this one Jason. Just don't make me wait two more months, that's it

Shipping batteries is very hard at the moment, it is one of my biggest issues.... (unless you live in the USA, i have got that dialed in)

for about 6 weeks i could not even get any battery delivered to Australia, Which meant I couldn't test prototypes... its shit!

So please email support@enertionboards.com and say you want us to find another shipping option, this way it will help me to train my staff better..

I am trying to direct all communications to them so they can learn, so please bare with us whilst we are skilling up our team.

Same here (from South Africa), just got refunded without asking about alternatives. I am a full-time electronic engineer and certainly don't mind assembling the space cell myself. If this is an option I would like to opt-in (order no: 3875). I have already emailed Linda earlier today. I will wait for a response tomorrow when the sun is on your side again.

https://www.instagram.com/p/BG7zV9YhBk0/?taken-by=longhairedboy

https://www.instagram.com/p/BG70ADUBBmE/?taken-by=longhairedboy

no phase lead connectors which is fine by me. XT60 on the battery side which is fine for space cell and now lipo users too but i always chop them. No shrink tube on these anywhere. I suggest adding some before building with them. 

The board is black, which is kind of awesome as it indicates the power of Lord Skatan coursing through its traces. Still no vertical USB ports, so bring your right angle  USB
connectors.

Sweet. Now, how do I connect the two controllers to the space cell? Where do I find this 4 pin thing? I have been looking, and im over it... The shrink wrap should be easy enough to find. I bought 5.5mm bullet connectors to connect to these carvon hubs, that was correct right? I appreciate your help, it is a pita to track this shit down....

These are used to connect the VESCs:

For the space cell connection you need to solder two Y-connections for the (+) and (-) cables.

You can use these as well. http://www.getfpv.com/male-to-male-servo-extension-cable-26awg-jr-style-5-pcs.html. Just cut off/ignore the last pin. If you have an old computer case you can salvage the power button/led/etc headers from them as well.

I was just about to ask this question on the shrink tube so i wouldn't have to take my own measurements. Thanks!

@ekitesurfer For dual VESC over the CAN bus, just solder them. In my experience the plugs eventually come loose, and once they do the VESCs take issue with that for some reason and stop responding to throttle commands. You would think that the one VESC with the PPM signal attached would keep responding, but none of mine have done that so far, at least not during the set up and bench testing.

Just a quick update.

**Situation:** Enertion can't ship Space Cell Pro 3 to my country after all. That's sad. It's fine, I just want my money back.

**Expected Customer Service Answer:** Let me get that refund for you, i'll check your payment method and get it done asap.

**What actually happened:** _I got a straight refund without even being asked about it, got my money sent to a PayPal account (my enertions account email, btw NOTHING TO DO WITH MY PAYPAL ACCOUNT) that doesn't even exist (Since I paid with my own credit card and NOT PayPal). So now I don't have my batteries, nor the money.._

**Expected Customer Service Answer**: Wow, that was our mistake. Let me fix that!

**WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED**: _We can't do anything, contact PayPal._

Being a PR student, having work experience in Customer Service, Marketing, and PR, this thing is JUST AWFUL. I can't even describe how mad I am.

Hey Jason, 
I emailed Enertion support again earlier this week and received a reply this morning but the reply was really no more helpful than the reply I got last time I tried emailing them. 

They told me that I'd get a tracking number when the enclosure was shipped but I was given no indication as to when I can actually expect it to ship.

Considering that you've received a shipment of the enclosures over a week ago and the official shipping date you've listed above has passed several days ago, I would really appreciate an update as to within what sort of timeframe you expect that you will start shipping them out to customers?

Cheers

Hi Hoochij4s,

I do understand you are upset that your country won't allow battery shipments, it's totally shit i know... the rules keep changing every few weeks. Maybe we will have a better solution soon.

That being said, I am not sure why you feel the need to post this situation on the forum and make such a big deal about it, trust me I would prefer to keep your money & send you a battery. But it seems impossible at the moment. So we tried to refund you & we also emailed you about that. Maybe the email you used to order was not a correct email?

ALSO, Please try to have some respect for my staff, this public comment is very unfair..... Linda was actually trying to do the right thing for you, she sent you an email explaining the situation & tried to refund your money quickly by sending to your (wrong?) email. Her intentions were all good, maybe your email was wrong & maybe she tried to refund too quickly?  But she was trying hard to provide you with timely service.

My staff are new & trying their best to get everything done in a timely manner, please try to be reasonable.

P.S. We have already contacted PayPal asking them how we can refund your credit card payment manually, the option for processing a refund after 60 days doesn't exist. We hope that PayPal improves their system for us, but they havent yet. 

regards
JASON

Yeah, I know. I dont usually post this kind of stuff, but there are some basics to follow up and thats exactly why I was mad. I'm sure you'll get along with time, as I said before, Enertion is a huge upcoming project and theres a lot to learn as you keep growing, thats just the nature of companies. 

**My kindly advice**: Start giving some personal, complex answers, even if the question in matter is literaly stupid. As I said, I worked in Customer Service in a Cellphone Company (WHICH MAKES IT EVEN WORSE, THEY ARE HELL IN MY COUNTRY), customers are usually mad about basically everything. You just have to take the exact amount of time for a simple answer and for a long answer, both types should be answered with customization (_so the customer actually thinks he's not receiving the exact same message than the guy before_) but also with accuracy (_the costumer problem must be solved in just one ticket, the only case it is permited to have more than one ticket is if the customer wasn't clear with the question/problem_).

These are just thoughts, based on my experience, little things matter just as much as the big ones. In the end, its all about the **[Wow! Moments](http://lincolnmurphy.com/customer-success-wow-moment/)** (Interesting to read, definetely)

Cheers Jason!

**Edit**: My situation is being handled by Jason's staff :slight_smile:

Is there a list of the enertion status messages and what they actually mean?
Reason is I got an email this morning telling me that my order is "Awaiting Pickup" after last week when the status changed to "Awaiting Fulfillment".
I have no idea what that means and there is no list that I know of that explains these terms.
UPS and DHL for example have a FAQ on their website in which they list the meanings behind their status changes - that would be nice for enertion as well @onloop @EnertionSupport

[/quote]

this status labels are mostly internal stuff that helps us manage the 400+ orders waiting to be shipped... if we could customize them we would make them say something slightly more meaningful....

basically,

if your order can be shipped sometime soon (parts in stock) it has status "awaiting fulfilment" all orders have this status at the start
if your order needs to be shipped from another place, china, America we change to  "awaiting shipment"
if your order is not able to be shipped soon, because we are waiting on stuff that will take some time, e.g. Raptor "awaiting shipment"

at the moment we making lots of changes trying to help us get through our massive list of backorders....

I have said it before & ill say it again... 1400% growth is not easy.... the system i had built originally was not designed for this many orders...

For those that haven't already read onloops post in another thread, FYI the VESCs have already been in transit from Florida in the US to Australia.  I'm assuming they will get there Monday or Tuesday.  Then they can start shipping those out, and building raptors.

Edit:. They are in miami today.  So later this week they will be in Australia.

I ordered my VESC from DIYElectricSkateboard and have had it for about a month now, but had to wait 3 months for it.
Then I decided to get the SpaceCell and said fuck it, get the Pro4. Ordered early to, hopefully, get it early.

Just in case anyone is wondering about the SPACE Cell Pro 4, here is an update I got as a reply from Enertion:
"The SPACE CELL Pro 4 have been manufactured and are now being sent from the Battery Factory to the Battery Logistics Company.

As you are based in the US the battery will be sent out from our US based Distributor once they clear it through customs, this process from factory to your door is overly complicated for batteries and can take somewhere between 7-20 days. 

As soon as we get your tracking number we will update you. Thanks for your Patience."

For the SpaceCell, is it okay to change the fuse to a higher amp rating? I'd imagine so, since the battery is rated at 80amps. Just curious in case I wanted to up the 40amps to something like 50amps or 60amps.

why do you want a higher amp rating?

you could bypass the BMS completely & remove the fuse all together....

But why? need more info, what motors? what gearing reduction? what wheel size?

I'm in Europe. I ordered a raptor. The scheduled says that raptor orders with higher #s than mine should start shipping out at the first July. So I guess it's the delay that holds back the vescs a week or two more than expected. Therefor any order that include a vesc (raptor in my case) gets delayed. 
It's very unfair to say that Jason tricks his customer if you don't have any evidence.

As I said, it's just a "guess", because the vescs destined for the eu have arrived (we know this for a fact).
Maybe it's really the just packing which delays them again for I week (wich I really doubt).

Also, we don't have an official explanation why the vescs delayed another week.

I'm waiting for vesc's and pro 4.  The anticipation is killing me,  haha. I'm #45** for vesc and I ordered my battery on Wednesday.  Hope I get to ride my board this summer :s.  Anybody get a pro 4 yet?  Curious to how much room there is for the VESC'S?

This is the reply I got
> Hi Sander

> We apologise for the delay but we are working as hard as we can to have your order shipped as soon as possible.
> Because of delays on production of the VESC and some customs problems with motors and pulley stock we have been delayed.

> We plan to have all orders shipped by Mid August. but are working to get your order out as soon as we can, i will personally check is we can push your order to shipping any faster.

> Regards The Enertion Team

Seriously, Mid August?
@onloop Care to explain? In this post it says my VESC should be shipped 4 days ago

We all have been waiting, I've been waiting almost 4 months for a raptor that I wanted to have for the short summer here in Michigan.  It got delayed so many times I lost track.  According to the most recent info if should have started shipping already.  Let's see the status, I want to have the raptor in 2 weeks at most!  I'm order  2782.

[/quote]

I am really sorry you have had to wait, I totally understand how frustrating it is (i have been waiting too)...but please refrain from exaggeration as that only makes my job harder and it confuses everyone & undermines my brand & business.

In case you need a refresher, Your order was April 6th, the stated delivery date for your raptor was clearly marked as "Delivery after April 30th"

Assuming that meant May 1st (which it didn't) you have been waiting just over 2 months. Or approx 50 working days.

Your Raptor will ship this week.

the date of shipping for space cell pro4 at the top of this thread says 14th of July.

technically the pro4 have shipped before the 14th of July... they are in transit.

the problem is shipping batteries from one country to another takes forever....  once it is received by my distributor in the destination country it should only take 4-5 days of transit time to actually arrive at the end user address.

```

small scale manufacturing & international logistics is extremely confusing, so I can understand your frustration.

here is a brief summary of what went down.


1. VESC made in factory in US, This took 4 months of fucking around to setup. Was meant to take 30 days.
2. Shipping rates for VESC from US direct to Europe is very expensive (4x what i pay) this was an unexpected surprise.
3. So therefore, they need to come to Australia in bulk shipments.
4. Shipping from US to Australia via USPS took 2-3 weeks, fuck knows why.
5. Some of the bulk consignments got returned to sender, fuck knows why. This added +1 week of waiting.
6. We split & ship individual VESC to Europe using our discounted rates, this takes a few days. 
7. It's the weekend, in Australia people don't work. Lazy Fucks.
8. Tomorrow is a work day, If I'm not looking after my new baby & wife ill be working.
9. All VESC will be shipped before end of JULY & All customers will get an email with tracking.


THE BEST NEWS, I'll never be out of VESC AGAIN and everyone can stop being a dick about the VESC.

Pulleys come from Australia, batteries from China, VESC direct from USA

Dude, sleep is that thing where your mind cuts out for a few seconds and you end up typing a line of gibberish. Usually happens after the effects of your last coffee have worn off. It may be time to upgrade to a more serious espresso machine. That usually takes care of the problem.

I dont have any problem with waiting. I can order and get VESC in a week if i need one right now. I just hate these lies! If you can't tell when they arrive, say that you don't know when! Don't say in june, in june say july and so on.. that's stupid and that's the thing which makes me rage!

I can understand your frustration but the folks at @EnertionSupport isn't clairvoyant. They make the best estimates that they can make. Last batch, the manufacturer mess up the VESC lighting issue, it still works, they could've send those out, but they decided not to compromise on quality so they return it and delay the schedule again. And then there's shipping problem, custom problem etc, all unpredictable. But people still insists on a schedule because that's just human psychology, they need a due date. My point is this, at the get go we were already informed of the situation and problems. Of all the small companies I've worked with or bought from, Enertion is already pretty Informative. 

Seriously though, if you desperately need a VESC now just buy it from other vendors so at least you'll have something to do while waiting for Enertion's.

My order is 4694 for a dual raptor. Money taken but no information after that. After 4 times sending messages I get nothing in return. On my account page it says awaiting fulfilment but absolutely communication as to when or if I will get the board before the summer is over. I live in the UK so I take it I'm unlikely to get it this year. This is very poor service. Even evolve UK reply as does Evolve (aus).
What do I do now? Ask for a refund, who? When will I get it, who know? The website needs better customer service.

Thanks for your valued order,

when did you message us? & how? did you email to support@enertionboards.com ?

We have about 180-200 unanswered emails at the moment....60-70 new emails each day, many more over the weekends, this is an ongoing problem... we are working hard to fix it.... we are trying to answer them all in timely manner.. but each email can take 5-10mins to answer. Only 7 hours in every work day, last week we allocated most of our resources to  packing hundreds of back orders... raptors included!

Please tell me what you want me to say? 

Rest assured everyone is getting their orders sent & we are on basically on schedule, we are doing everything as quick as possible. 

Please note on your order & on our website it clearly says 
**RAPTOR NEXT BATCH SHIPPING AFTER 31st Jul 2016**

If this is not clear enough i apologise. Happy to refund you.

Guys, I don't need the aggression or am i being over sensitive?  All I stated was, it would be nice, possibly important, that on the order website if there is a delay and orders may take longer than normal to be fulfilled than it would have been nice to have seen that before ordering and not have to research this myself. I am the customer after all and all I asked was a little response to my questions. Now Jason has been great at answering questions about vesc, battery management etc, but not once did he hint that there is some long delays expected either due to deliveries or completion dates. I'm happy that he is a father but should that affect me? If Bill Gates decided not to produce windows as he wanted to go to the beach or Steve Jobs wanted a sleep in instead or guiding Apple, where would we be now.Also, as this is a build your own board or such like, not everyone has owned or built an electric board before so cut some slack. To some of us, this is new and unexplored territory. The reason I chose Enertion over Evolve is because of my research, but solely on buying a made up dual Raptor. I want a Raptor, paid for a Raptor all I ask is some communication as to how long I will have to wait for said Raptor.

Just wanted to say one thing, when onloop says shipping next batch of Raptors after July 31, that is really vague and literally can mean anything. So I understand other people's concerns. I too was wondering wtf that meant and was going to cancel my order, but I'm just going to hope that it actually means August. Nobody else making quality boards right now is shipping immediately anyway so might as well just wait for the board you really want. 

On a side note if Jason worked overtime the next couple of weeks and actually pushed out a bunch of boards he would make a lot of people happy and secure future buisness, with those customers. Complete boards should be priority right now in my humble opinion. @onloop

I'm in the same boat, waiting for my raptor.  I thought it was great when @EnertionSupport posted the Order Update a week ago.  If Enertion could just keep that list updated that would be awesome.  Just copy it into a google sheets document and post it here so everyone can can see how much progress Enertion is actually making getting all of these orders out.  Onloop would also get way less people posting just to ask when their order is going to be shipped out.  Personally I just want to know a ballpark date for when my raptor will ship, but unfortunately my order number isn't in the range of orders included in the Order Update.  I'm doing my best to be patient, but it was a lot of money to spend and I just want a little bit of information on my order status.

Hi, also looking at a refund if possible. I've sent msg via eBay where I've made a purchase and payment with no acknowledgement or response. I've also sent a personal message to you and email to support last week I've even engaged through live chat to be directed to the support email address. The estimated delivery on eBay was to be on the 22nd July at the latest with 10 items listed in stock.i sense this won't be the case. How do we arrange a refund?

I sent an email on Thursday. I sent an eBay message a week and a half ago. I'm a fan of what you do in promoting your business and from what understand you sell a quality product but communication is your achilles heal. Just received and email from support. My order numbers are 4739 and 4740 which I don't see on the list. When putting the order through ebay you had listed more than 10 in stock of each. Sound like this is not the case at all. Can you please look into as I cannot wait another week for someone to respond to my reply. Not here to cause waves just need to know what is going on.

@onloop, Just for the sake of everyone with warranty claims, what's your Policy in ordernumbers on that matter ?
Let's take my example: 
ordernumber #4833 of dull part 0$ with a note of new 6355 motor and a VESC. (14/07/2016)

Last time for the other motor, I've ordered 2 myself but it was a production issue so you've included a third in warranty and managed to get it in Belgium within 2 weeks. Customs was 78 euro's so I've almost payed the third as well :rolling_eyes:  but that's a European issue. Yet it's annoying...

when you have broken products and warranty claims you can get your import duties back for the broken things. Just need to contact your taxation office and deal with them.

It is not his job to do tax evasion for you! You guys are nuts - grow up and understand that you are actually commiting a crime. You can't honestly complain when the other party does not want to do this. You can ask them to do it but can't be pissed if they say "no".

Hi, in my country it doesn't matter the value written on the package or if it is declared as a gift. They will open the package and if you don't have the invoice or other documents confirming the value paid, they will go to the Internet and find the value for you. Usually the values you find in the Internet are correct.

Raptor dual order #4427 and today I received the Space Cell! I didn't get any tracking info or email. 
The Space Cell BMS showed the Voltage instead of the percentage of battery left, but I managed to fix it just pushing the lcd display down. I think that the BMS was set up properly, but the packaging was so tight around the fuse that it might have pushed the BMS button.
I can't wait to receive the raptor itself! :smiley:

I cannot seem to find a download button. I guess they are looking for the commercial invoice that gets sent along with the parcel. Not sure why they are asking me for it.  Someone at DHL is confused I think.

Edit/update: Just looked at my "order status" page on the Enertion site and where it used to say "(NEXT BATCH SHIPPING AFTER 31st Jul 2016)" it's been replaced in the past couple days with "(NEXT BATCH SHIPPING AFTER 31st Aug 2016)" which is more than a little disappointing if true..

I totally feel you Brother. Normally when I buy/order some expensive toy I've been building up in my head (Google Glass was my last example of this) there's this week or two period where I research EVERYYYTHING about it and progressively get more excited until delivery day, when normally tbh it's a bit of an anticlimax. Something tells me this wont be the case with our Raptor Duels. Tho this waiting period is absolutely excruciating, I'm right there with you :)

of course we must change this each month..... if i didn't change it then in august it would say shipping after July 31st, that would confuse people.

This change of date does not affect existing orders, it is so that anyone contemplating to place a new order will understand they are not in stock. We build each raptor by hand in my garage, we can only make about 20 per month.

So there will always (at least in the foreseeable future) be a lead time... & i will always need to extend that date on the website.

Hope it makes sense.

I think he can only get 20 decks at a time. He can technically build a board in 12mina as per his vid, but there would be configuring of controller now and also packaging and logistics. He doesnt have unlimited fund like Evolve to buy 100s, plush they take longer to make the decks. If he had unlimited supply of VeScs which he is working on there has always been something else that has been an issue.

As @Photorph said. The guys an Aussie doing his best out of his garage. Be patient and put up with his operational issues. If you dont like it just go eslewhere.

I think the problem is related to the huge increase in new people wanting to build their own electric skateboards.... they see photos & videos of all the amazing builds people are capable of doing these days. They search for info about esk8 & They stumble across this forum, which is fairly easy since it ranks top 5 for many related keywords, they see the huge amount of well-organized information.... They are seeing more & more quality videos explaining how to build esk8 & Of course they naturally make the assumption this community is large & well established with plenty of resources & huge corporate funding backing them up....

The truth is 2 years ago you couldn't buy most of the stuff we have today, your only option was alien drive systems for motor mounts & alien power system for motors.

**There was no;**
RAPTORS
VESC
SPACE CELL or 18650 PACKS
LCD WITH BATTERY %
ON / OFF SWITCHES (that's right, we couldn't turn our boards on & off with a switch 2 years ago)
COMPACT RECHARGEABLE REMOTES
HUB MOTORS
AFFORDABLE MOUNTS
LARGE QUALITY MOTORS
CARBON DECKS
DEDICATED FORUM
INSTRUCTIONAL VIDEOS

**700 Days ago none of the above was available!!!!** 


To this day I can count the number of established suppliers on one hand....

1. Enertion
2. DIY Electric
3. Ollin
4. esk8.de
5. Alien Drive System (they basically shut down and are now Alien Power System)


**That's 5 very small business servicing the entire world.** 

These businesses are all operated by guys in garages with zero external funding and minuscule profits margins, these businesses are run mostly on blood, sweet & tears. Each person must sacrifice time with their family to pack orders & answer emails.....Most of us work fulltime jobs to make ends meet. We can only afford to purchase stock based on our cash flows making expansion & scaling up extremely slow & risky.

The problem is none of the newbs understand this, they come on here and just expect everything to handed to them on a silver platter, they expect the best warranty, delivery time & service on par with giants of online retail like amazon.

They are more than happy to submit disputes with paypal for trivial issues like a dusty wheel pulley or a scratch on their trucks. They will yell out loud and kick up a fuss if their parts didn't arrive within the week. They demand delivery dates accurate to the day and don't stop to think of the countless hours of work required to arrange small-scale custom made parts with large factories who just don't care. On top of all that there are 100's of variables that all can disrupt the flow, things from customs blocking shipments, freight forward companies losing consignments, orders being made wrong, orders not being made at all, factories quoting 2 weeks & taking 4 months.... 

now to throw a spanner in the works, the industry growth was completely unpredicted, 700 days ago I started off ordering 20 motor mounts which lasted 3 months, then i order 100pcs to last for three months, then 200 for 2 months, now 400 barely gets me through a month, this growth is nearly impossible to manage let alone predict.. you can't forecast 1400% growth.... EVER

Then you realise your systems just don't work at this scale, you can't actually answer 100-150-200 emails each day & pack orders and build custom esk8's and design new products & test prototypes & deal with suppliers, whilst effectively communicating with your customers.... you just can't do it....

So you then need staff & they need to be trained... if you have ever worked in management you would know it takes about 3 months to get someone trained to a level of usefulness...  during the 3 months you basically run at a similar capacity that you could achieve running solo, except now you have more errors to fix because people need to make mistakes to learn.... so you take two steps forward & one step backwards.

Now... the problem is none of the newbs understand this, they just see a fancy website & expect world class, corporate level service.... if they don't get it they jump up & down like little babies....

**So what must happen?**

People just need to practise these key characteristics
1. Patience
2. Empathy
3. Appreciation

**In other words, don't be a dick & we will work our arses off to serve you to our best ability.**

@onloop makes some solid points here guys. This is a budding industry and the few suppliers that exist are incredibly communicative and helpful whilst their businesses grown exponentially. Ask not what your esk8 forum can do for you but what you can do for your esk8 forum.

@onloop I've emailed your support line back and forth for a week with different answers every time. Can you please clarify with me availability of your wireless remote. Website doesn't allow back orders it just shows unavailable but I was told they are arriving by the end of month and can be shipped with the vesc, pro4 cell, motor and  trucks I ordered. last response I received was wait till it becomes available on the website.

Could you please shed some light. You are the only one that provides straight answers!!!!

the truth, we are out of stock of the steez remote, we have designed a new slimmer & better remote..

https://www.instagram.com/p/BIRExOPA2bv/?taken-by=enertionboards


unfortunately,  it's not ready yet....


so we are in a transition period.... ran out of old model haven't got new one yet...

So i think as an interim solution we will be offering this one. they will be in stock soon. (currently in transit to enertion HQ)

I don't know, I've tried their remote before, the board broke only after a day of use, had to return it so i didn't really get to use it extensively. It felt a little flimsy? That's why I was a bit worried that @onloop Nano-X might be mirroring the same hardware, glad its not. 

Honestly, I might be the only one here, but I like the Yuneec Ego controller out of all of them (more than BB), its a tough little thing and I really like how they have progressive resistance. Too bad I can't hack it to make it work with the Raptor.

Hye. I ordered a mono drive r spec pro+ and a besc together so i dont have to pay shipping costs. They say the order is awaiting fulfillment. Any idea when the vescs are coming in. Will it be shipped this month or not? Also, i send an email to support asking about the settings for an enertion motor on bldc tool (like at how many amps it needs to run) (battery voltages i already figured out) they said i would get an email within 72 ours but it has been 4 days since then. Can you just give me the settings and at how many amps the motor is? (6374 190 kv 3200w)

Hi man, I get your frustration but you have to aknowledge, when you're building something custom. There are no standard settings ( in fact there are, but ideal settings depend on your build) 

In case of your question. What batteries do you run on? What capacity, discharge rate, charging rate) are you at? 
Which belt size are you using and which pulleys, belt and motor setup? This way we can calculate your ideal settings...

**this thread is not for personal inquiries, we are so fucking busy atm.. sorry - i just can't keep answering these questions...**

the only way to get an answer is submit a ticket support@enertionboards.com once we get to it we will reply.

**Please make note: if we are spending all our the time answering emails we are not packing orders or communicating with our suppliers & distributors.**

each of these lookups can take about 10mins.. you all need to try to wait patiently.. your stuff will ship once we have packed it...

nearly every order in our system is complete... by early august everything will be sent!!!

the only exception is raptors & the dates for those are on the website when you ordered.

To make matters worse this means somone else doesn't get a vesc because it went to you when you didn't even want it. Plus now we have the added hassle of processing the return and doing refunds and we lose the money spent on shipping. Plus the time wasted to answer this post. Plus my staff when they do finally get to your ticket will waste more time trying to workout what you are talking about.... which means they are not answering other more important tickets...

Why not just receive the vesc you ordered that we have shipped and be happy?

Or just don't order.

You're making life difficult for yourself and others man. 
If you have a support question it's best to keep it short and make answerable in a matter of yes/no or specific information.

If you want to know when something will arrive you should just watch here as people update, emailing support when will my order arrive is an open ended question that can't really be answered.

If you want a refund and did it through paypal, use paypal do it if you're so desperate and feel like enertion are stalling or stuffing you around. But note they don't have to refund you shipping fees if it's already in transit because you changed your mind. Nor do they have to refund you the cost sending the item back.

I can tell you now, that even though I waited for 11 weeks before I got everything from enertion, kickpush and I forget where I got my FSGT2B I was wrapped I waited it was worth it even though I only got 20 minutes worth of riding before I had to get something replaced (I was unlucky). I will likely have to wait another week or two until I can go for another ride but instead of nagging support with multiple emails (I put in a question as a side note today no biggy though) I'll wait and be stoked when I get it :slight_smile:

@onloop. Maybe you should try (with all the madness going on) to have a grading support. 
1st line support for people who actually know what's wrong with their product, give a decent description what's happening, together with proof and a possible solution.

2nd line support for the guys who actually don't have any understanding of how their esk8 works. Which would have a lot of questions and are costly in a time manner to answer.

And then maybe make a split where customers are self-building and have compatibility questions and customers who bought a complete Raptor from you. Hence the VIP club.

Edit: don't get me wrong, just trying to help you out.

Ok. Where do I start...... 1) I ordered from eBay which told me you had stock that would be delivered by the 22nd of July. I stayed patient. 2) I emailed support to tell them that ebay placed separate orders and to merge them whilst doing so I asked about adding truck and motor kit to the original order. Was told to list the order number in the comment section and it will be sent together so I did so. This obviously hasn't been done. 3) I've asked support about the wireless controller availability to be told they are coming in end of this month if I wanted to place an order. Umm Adam.... I cannot place an order.... It's coming up unavailable......then I was told to wait till it becomes available on the site haha. Then I asked you. You told me that you are no longer getting the current controller and that you await a new version. You have an interim remote available. I've asked how do I order this and all I hear is my echo. 4) I asked for a refund before the vesc was sent. Tell me if I'm being patient so far?

I totally understand why you are feeling frustrated..... 

it's the same frustration anyone would feel when they ask someone to do things they are not capable of achieving.

It's like when I ask my 2 year year old to stop screaming out nonsense & go to sleep... it doesn't matter how hard i try, or how many ways I deliver the message, he just doesn't do it.... he doesn't have the systems to process my requests... so I must be patient and allow him to develop so he can better process my requests...

Another example; We can't sell you the  new remote because it's not on our website....

We can't send your motor mount kit because we are waiting for truck risers to come.... 

We can't bundle it together all together because we don't have it all. We can't ship it quicker. We cant easily sort through hundreds of emails and piece together complex instructions on how to combine/cancel/modify/rectify orders that have been done on multiple platforms on multiple days.

We can't do it because our systems are not designed to do it. We just don't have the resources to offer our customers a premium esk8 concierge service. People just won't pay for that.

Our systems are really simple. People order shit we pack it and send it as fast as possible. We are just a bunch of simple people in a garage trying to operate a simple business....

My advice to anyone reading this.

1. Think about what you want before ordering.
2. Only order items that you want.
3. Don't order if you can't accomplish steps one & two.


Emailing us and asking us to do things we cannot do wastes our time and generally leads to delays and errors.

1)I was told you could bundle it all by you're support Adam. 2) you have listed over 10 in stock on eBay with delivery on the 22nd at the latest. You set an expectation.  Btw I pay a fee for each delivery on eBay.
3) I wasn't after the latest remote. Just a remote that you mentioned.
4)Adam advised that all items will be posted by the end of July.

I'm tired of the back and forth. I just want a refund. Happy to provide an Australian contact number or email address for you to contact me direct to arrange to take it off this forum. I'm not wasting my time with support.

If you have spoken with my staff already and they told you what they can do already what is the point of all this?

I don't know how much longer I need to wait for a response from support. Do other items get sent before that similarly to the vesc. You sent out the vesc then I get an email stating ' btw there might be a shorting  fault with the vesc we sent' why not check it before it was sent if you were aware?.... I'll just go through pay pal for the refund.

If you read the email it mentions that enertion is now adding a second layer of shrink tube to prevent issues. Seems to me like your caught up in your own self importance to even read now, The message is intended to help the community and esk8'ers. Your current mind set is stuck in the negative, and you are not contributing anything useful to this thread. This thread is to get and idea what order numbers are being filled, so one can guestimate when their order will be filled. Your attitude is getting tiresome.

It's kinda hard to void warranty if you are doing something that the seller advised @Tomkav. It might say that altering voids warranty but you have specific evidence that the seller advised for people to do there's no arguing that. Sometimes, there's the written rules, and then there's just plain commen sense. Also when ordering from a busy seller it should be a given that you'll need to wait a while. Patience is a virtue, and yes patience runs out but at the same time it's rude to publicly criticize someone's hard work when you know that they are working to the fullest of their capacity. If you want a refund, just send the VESC back after it arrives and email enertion support. @onloop already mentioned that they lose money for the shipping so it shouldn't be a problem for you at all.

I'm not sure if you read what I write but I was sold on the fact I was told everything was in stock to find out it's not. I also ask questions to receive 2 different answers. Sometimes not even receive a response which needs me to chase up. Now tell me, does one start losing patience? 100%. When I get the money back I'm going to buy something from a evolve given the warn you that the item will be available late Aug. Yes I will wait longer now but from what I read, they under promise over deliver. And there is someone on the other line willing to help over the phone. 10min email = 2 min phone call =all questions answered when you finish the call.

Also if you read back with the exception of the vesc issue I didn't criticize the product because I haven't experienced it and I ordered it because from what I see it's a good product. I criticize the service. Sometimes public forums are needed for awareness to ensure people know what to expect and for comfort to others that their issue isn't isolated. I'm an Aussie and nothing would please me more than to see Enertion be a prominent player in the esk8 market but sometimes tough constructive criticism is required to influence change. Something a business owner should value

Enertion like any good company will back their product and their warranty.  Enertion have shown this.  Your problem initially stems from a number of issues which you feel misled and thus frustrated by the outcome as it is out of your control.

Ive been there and you just have to deal with it.  Onloop has responded now for you and advised you on what you can do.  Deal with your contact at Enertion. 

Also onloop is building his new team and training them.  The staff are still learning as thet go.  See onloops Vloggs. 

If yourve got the vescs in the end happy days.  Hes flagged the issue.  Which is unfortunate and should not have happened.  But pressure from the DIY community is outstripping what he can produce. Demand for these things is not helping him time to spend on QA.  Im not saying its right to send out vescs that could short out,  but it happens to all manufacturers and suppliers.  Given he sells all over the world its easier for everyone to be advised of issue and possible fix.  Ie move cable away from pins.  I think thats fair. I dont want to wait another few weeks for a replacement and hassel if its nit even an issue if I set out build being aware if issue. 

Ebay site though needs to be fixed.  Its not helping his customers.  Dont take offence to anything Im saying. When buying on ebay I always check description carefully to check included and excluded itemd,  email for stock update. Then if I get a prompt response and confirmation in stock I may consider ordering.  Read feedback and check % rating of seller.  Then I forget about it for 30 days and email if I dont get anything. Not to say you didnt do this. But just a tip. 

Alternatively I go to a shop and buy the dam thing. Not going to be able to do that with vescs so your stuck with doing it as an internet purchase.  You just have to be patient.

It's a caution that your VESC **_may_** be affected and how to prevent damage. Mine was one of the affected VESCs and it did cause damage, but I emailed support along with the thread that I started that led to me discovering the fault. I'm not sure if it's that thread that made them realise the issue or something else, but 2 days (which is good response time for a manufacturing fault) after I posted my issue here and emailed support onloop had created a topic and sent an email to all customers or all customers with an order number within a specific range.

Edit: Thought I'd add that onloop has also shown the amount of VESCs that they are redoing the shrink wrap on to prevent this issue for others that haven't had their VESC sent to them.

I'm new to the entire esk8 world and I originally went all in and bought a raptor.  Now that I've had a month or so to learn and research everything about it I think I should wait before I make a decision on what to get or maybe even build.  I know you have some great stuff on the horizon with a new remote and possibly a non-carbon fiber board.

Couldn't agree more. Also being new to the whole e-skate thing I'm very eager to learn all the ins and outs. The idea of building a custom one is appealing but would take a level of knowledge so far above my current understanding, and I know I'd get beyond frustrated when my efforts didn't result in a reliable kick-ass ride. Something I'm confident I'll be able to do once I've had my Raptor for a while and spent time playing with settings and upgrading parts over time - while having crazy fun!! You KNOW you're gonna be pumped when that box arrives @Wolfwoof  :)

Hello Jason,

Linda told me to refresh the web page, so I have started from an empty cart and added the 3 items :slight_smile:

mono drive r-spec pro+
vesc-standard 
space cell pro3 electric skateboard battery

 but when I validate the paypal I get this message : "Unfortunately one or more items in your cart can't be shipped to your location. Please choose a different delivery address."

Any help ?
Nobody here had this issue ?

Regards
```

starting to wonder if I should have ordered the SpaceCell Pro4 instead of the 3. When I ordered Pro3 said it was in stock and Pro4 was in Pre-order. I thought i was being crafty. Lately, I haven't seen any stock updates from jason about the Pro3 shipping from Texas. Only Pro4 :confused: Any insight @EnertionSupport ? I'll gladly pay the up-charge if that means I get my juice faster.

I remember that the SCP3 shipped first and I started seeing people post about theirs. Then came the 4's and I got mine, not sure why you didn't get yours in the first round if you've ordered a while ago. :confused:

I'm not super sad yet because judging from people's order numbers that have received their crap in the above posts my order should be in the next batch of 25 BUT i just haven't seen Jason say much about SCP3 anywhere. Only v.4 :frowning: I guess I'll find out next week.

@gibs double check your shipping address. One time I didn't put enough details of my address and it wouldn't let me pay. This was when I was ordering with HK

I have finally succeeded to pay :slight_smile:

Finally when the system told me some parts can not be sent to my country. I have created a new address (from this point) and it was accepted. (I have something like 9 addresses now but the most important is that I have ordered)
Now I need some patience :)

Order #5261 rocks :)

Hi man, isn't that good for SpaceCell PRO...too much flex for me

You should have separate components, to avoid the middle for that deck.

79kg/175 lbs. Doesn't really flex at all. It kind of does if you really jump up and down, but why would you do that :P

Yes! I felt in love with the Hackbrett Bambus 3.0 (my profile's pic). Madrid makes really nice stiff decks also.
My board is 97x25cm, really spacious.

Awesome, have you got a photo with the gear mounted. Found a deck that is super stiff and no flex but the under deck design doesn't look like it will fit the space cell pro because of the carvings. The deck is a duster urso. Had one in a shop her down under and my 95k frame couldn't get any flex out of it.

Not yet, I'm going to build it as soon as will arrive Mono spec+ from Enertion. I'm sure it will fit perfectly! That velocity should be ok, the most important thing is that must be stiff and not too much concave. The distance between trucks has to be at least 65-70cm (space Cell is 56cm lenght!!!!)

Hey Luke. I live in Tauranga and had to pay $125 of tax on an order of a vesc and 6372 motor. I just got my space cell pro4 and didn't have to pay any tax on that. I wonder if it was because the vesc and motor got shipped through DHL whereas the space cell got shipped through Australia Post. Which part of the country are you in?

Hey bro, I'm from Wellington. I just received my space cell pro 3. I paid no tax on it.  I paid approx 25% tax on my Two vescs and remote though. I think the rule is that you pay tax on packages worth more than 400 nzd. The vesc will have been packaged properly and displayed actually product value, and If your space cell was sent like mine, the product was really undervalued on the package slip. Mine said it's worth $100. I wish lol

**I'll happily give you all an update,** 

I have just lost two employees, I also have a 30 day old newborn baby & mum that need my attention.

To summarize we are now extremely understaffed, but we are still working our arses off to pack & ship every order we have, that's what we do.

**If your order has not shipped, these are the reasons.**
1. Your parts are not in our warehouse or in our distributors warehouse so we cannot ship it to you.
2. Your parts are in our warehouse but we have not got to your order yet because we are working on orders that came in before yours.


**Some other interesting facts.....**
1. Every single item on our website is either in stock or currently being made or currently in transit to the various distribution warehouses we have, either US, BELGIUM or AUSTRAlIA
2. The only items we currently don't have in stock is wheels & narrow hanger trucks - they are about 1 week away from the Australian Warehouse.
3. We are always working to get orders out as fast as possible, we have been non-stop for months, 90% of our time is spent trying to get orders out. So getting frustrated that your order hasn't shipped is a waste of your energy, just relax everyone is waiting and soon the wait will be over & you will have the parts.
4. We are always ordering more & more stock with our suppliers, **always!!!** but they need to manufacture everything for us from raw materials... it takes time & shipping items around the globe takes time.... sometimes the new stock gets here before the existing stock runs out, sometimes it doesn't. 
5. We are in Australia, so we are shipping all our products globally all the time, this is a difficult process, especially when there are dangerous goods involved... things get stopped & slowed down all the time... each country has its own rules & regulations, customs processing times vary & sometimes you will have to pay tax... it's not our call.. 
6. Answering emails about where your order is & what date it will arrive takes about 10 minutes per email, most of the time we need to count back through hundreds of orders, email overseas suppliers & finally estimate the transit times between the various countries just to get an approximate answer... most of the time the answer is just a guess anyway. We would prefer not to guess so please stop asking us.




_**FINALLY**_
_All of our existing outstanding orders (as of now) will be shipped by the end of august (unlesss otherwise indicated by shipping dates clearly marked on our website) most of your orders will have already been partially packaged or arranged in some way to be sent to our distributors & all the paper work & administration work required to organize your parts shipments would have already been done, therefore all order cancellations will incur a 20% cancellation fee, your refunds will take 30 days to process._
