Hey guys, one of the screw stuck on the motor can, is there any way to get it out except a sew to cut it? 

I tried hex head and these phillips head. Both of them are not really working for me. (stainless steel)
Is there any screw head pattern and material of screw are less likely to get messed up from the head?
Thanks!

If you have a dremel or sharp file you can grind a flathead profile into the top of the screw and use a flathead screwdriver to remove it.

Sometimes a square head can get it out too. But yeah dremel it and back it out.

even better is torx if you have bits handy. Phillips were actually designed to strip to prevent over tightening and damaging threads. Torx will give you all thee power you need to TEAR the threads right out of that tapped hole the way god intended.

+1 on Torx in a stripped Hex, a tap in the center with a needle punch can sometimes help before if really stuck fast

Ok that’s a philips bolt, that’s a never never for a 4mm motor bolt, Dremel maybes

Thanks guys, I don't know why I didn't used a dremel last time, I used a saw last time and cut part of the motor mount out lol. 

Do they even sell torx head screws in the hardware store? Never looked into them, but I will stop by my lcoal hardware store check them out next time.

I use [this](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07D3XZCDM/ref=cm_sw_r_em_apa_i_0MzeCbG9QQTFQ). Impact driver is needed though.

Is it a sealed can?  Be careful of metal filings getting in there or you'll be up for a strip down.  :grimacing:
