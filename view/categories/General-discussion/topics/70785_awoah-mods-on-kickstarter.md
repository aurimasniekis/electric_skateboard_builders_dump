Check these out: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/716906815/the-worlds-first-e-board-street-lighter-wheels-awo?ref=nav_search&result=project&term=Awoah%20

Looks like they are 97mm with a proprietary hub. I know we all want 107’s or above, but these things light up! I don’t like Kickstarter, anymore, but I still might back this.:thinking:

What are your thoughts?

I like them!  

I think they will boardfeel like any Labeda clear thane (good) and the battery-less system, if manufactured properly, should prove reliable.

Looks like they are marketing towards Evolve and Boosted (smart, since they can get a lot of buyers this way).  For us that means both ABEC and Kegel cores, hopefully, unless they have proprietary pulleys they ship with.

Yeah, looks interesting. I didn't see any mention of size, duro, or contact patch though. Kinda important if they want to market a wheel.

I actually had the opportunity at the Evolve World Cup to speak with the gentleman who came up with these. The cores are his own design and they do come with the pulleys.

It looks like the abec clone cores spaced differently. It might work with bolt on  pulleys?

I agree. I think he mentioned that they were 78a and 97mm. I believe they are, basically, clone 97's with lights.

Ah, That's not bad, but before I buy them it'd be cool if they did the same thing that Boa did and send a few samples to some of the people on here to review. Also a proprietary gear kinda sucks considering the esk8 market is already divided between kegel and abec. Still interested though.

I'll try it for sure I ride alot at night and the more visible I am the better. You can't miss these Tron wheels haha

Also, How many teeth are the drive gear. I assume 36?
```

## \#11 Posted by: mccloed Posted at: 2018-10-10T17:47:36.759Z Reads: 195

I'm pretty sure they are 32 tooth for the evolve and what ever comes standard on Boosted.
```

Damn 32t that's gonna be 40ish mph top speed on 97mm with 16t motor pulley on 12s
```

You'll lose a decent amount of torque though. 36 should really be the smallest gear on 97's. I run the evolve 38T on my Boa's and I think that's perfect.

the esk8 market is already divided between kegel and abec
[/quote]

In a way yes, the sk8 market is split between Evolve and Boosted users, neither of which really feature here and we make up a pretty small percentage. Any company with marketing savvy would send samples to those companies and seek alliances.

Kind of reminds me of my sons shoes when he was 3 years old that lit up when he walked.  Cool idea.
@Battosaii tron build is a great idea you gotta do it.

These are really interesting. I would pick up a set, but like @thiswasandy said its mainly for production boards and not DIY. Their pulley and flywheel hub have 8 "slots" while genuine flywheels only have 6. That leaves us locked in to 1 pulley directly from them and wont fit most of our setups. 

Unless I make a special hub adapter for them :thinking:

I'm sure we could measure them out and make our own. This one might fit: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1003206

the only thing different here is that the wheel has flywheel style core and is 97mm, why does it cost so much more than the literally thousands of led wheels on ebay that go for 16 bucks?
```

## \#19 Posted by: mccloed Posted at: 2018-10-10T21:17:54.747Z Reads: 157

Maybe because they are not mass produced yet? Not sure,

that's all it is I think, not a lot of info on the formula available.  Even though it looks cool, I would like to see more data to justify the cost.

I’m interested to see if it is made out of a known formula. Also the bears in the sunsets are very hard to change out if they die or clean them as the sunset wheels rely on the bearings to make the lights light up

Yup. I let them know about the important info missing. Glad they listened!

Nice, now only if we can get some samples of these sent to some of the well known / experienced people like Boa did with the constrictor so we can get an idea of how they ride.

I dont’t get what they mean by boosted wheels or evolve wheels or street wheels, whats the difference. The pulley design?

Think its the core and the amount of teeth.
And just them advertising to that crowd

ive been chatting with them but still havent gotten a clear answer as to if they fitt all abec style pulleys.. he did mention is was a "different" type of core... to which i replied that if the core needed a proprietary hub that he'd be missing out on the diy community because we cant use what is readily available or what we may already own....

They do not fit abec 11 style cores, as far as I know. This core has 8 holes.

I actually prefer 90mm Reflys after having tried all the DIY eskate options...

I'm using OG green 90mm Flywheels on my Evolve build and I love them. Abec is at the top of the wheel game for a reason.

re-hashing the almost dead =P theyre not gonna hit the goal, but i still think it would be fun to have some LED wheels... anyone else have the capabilities to make something like this happen with out a dumb ass proprietary core for abecs??  ;)

Digging up the grave. Gabriel / Colorado Cadi posted some videos of him riding these wheels. Looks like they are available for $150 for four wheels and two pulleys http://www.awoahmodz.com/new-products/name-of-product
