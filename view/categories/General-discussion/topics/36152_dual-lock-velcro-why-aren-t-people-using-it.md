# Dual lock Velcro, why aren’t people using it?

Was thinking about how to make my Lipo cases swappable, and came across dual lock Velcro. 

Probably gonna use it on both the enclosure and battery, this way whenever I want to swap it out, I can just pull off the enclosure and replace the pack and stick the enclosure back on. 

Seems like it can hold a pretty huge amount of weight so why aren’t builder using it for their batteries and enclosures? 

I would think it’s easier to swap out all the electronics and parts to another deck this way, or to make an easily swappable battery?

Will the vibrations cause it to fail more? As far as I’ve seen it’s pretty solid as it’s kind of like a zipper but on a surface.

VIbrations get everything at some point, including nuts n bolts. Velcro - even dual lock - will fail at some point to due vibrations. Epoxy some inserts and a proper attachment will be made. Velcro won’t do a solid job

Thanks for the clarification. 

With this in mind I am thinking of just using it for the enclosure as a cover, while the battery is secured on the deck. As the enclosure is pretty light, the vibrations shouldn’t affect it too much right?

Dont! Dual lock is TERRIBLE for vibrations normal velcro has worked FAR better in my board for some reason the dual lock just vibrates apart super easily. I know hobbyking, and im sure other sellers, have some super strong velcro I use and it works very well.

I'm using it on both my boards. It holds my receivers, focboxes, li-ion & a123 batteries and modules. I also put a glob of hot glue on each side of each vesc, receiver etc... I don't bother on the batteries. I put some foam between each piece and the enclosures to keep everything snug. Nothing comes loose so far.

Bottom line is that WHEN (not if) Velcro detaches on your board if you use it, you could very well be riding. The problem with this, especially with LiPO batteries is that even if the batteries themselves don’t hit the ground, a rock or other random object could then puncture them easily, perhaps without you noticing! The result would be a fire and a few hundred $$$ out the window. It’s 5$ for epoxy and inserts to secure your enclosure. That’s what I call a solid investment.

I use hard case lipos so a rock puncturing it shouldn’t be too much of a concern.

Will keep in mind what you said though. I’ll probably use 2 thumb screws + double lock so it is easier to remove, while being secure

Has it ever fallen off while riding? I’m considering using both Velcro straps and double lock for it.

I use the one in the pic below. What @JdogAwesome said is well worth noting. I use a hot glue on smaller components too and a semi firm black foam in between the enclosure and each piece. Not enough to impede cooling but enough the deal with shock. So that may be why it works for me. Thought it worth mentioning.

Dude I really recommend adding an enclosure to your board, if you go over something and scrape the bottom of your board, that could rip off your batterys and/or puncture them. Just the other day I scraped the bottom of my enclosure going over a driveway, thankfully I only messed up a bit of paint.

Just to corroborate with those already using velcro, I have my lipos, vesc, Bluetooth module and receiver velcro'd to my deck with an enclosure bolted on as a 'splash and stone' shield. 

Clocked just over 1k miles this week and can say that I've never had an issue with them separating. Enclosure keeps things snug but isn't bearing their weight and I've some old tarmac roads on my commute and the only things that feel like they'll fall off are my feet lol.

I use this:
[Heavy Duty Velcro](https://www.amazon.co.uk/VELCRO-Brand-Heavy-Duty-Stick/dp/B00186Q9AK)
Never had it come loose so far.

Good to hear many people are having such success with velcro. Definitely a good option for quick removal paired with a thumbscrew or clip

If someone needs Dual Lock, I still have more than 1000 Meter here in Germany.
Can ship by mail worldwide or when I fly to US next time also from there.

I used this one
3M™ Dual Lock™ Reclosable Fastener SJ3870.
Is there a better one to use between deck and batteries (shrink wrap) ?
