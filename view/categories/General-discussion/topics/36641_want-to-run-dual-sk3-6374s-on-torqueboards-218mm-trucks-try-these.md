Hi, I'm looking to upgrade my board to dual 6374 motors so need a set of trucks for the job,don't want custom charges or big delivery costs so uk or eu would be best.
Would prefer new but will accept used if not too beat up! 
Pictures please.

use caliber II trucks on amazon. 10 inches are best
https://www.amazon.com/Caliber-Truck-Co-Skateboard-44-Degree/dp/B00J5J6B0U/ref=sr_1_1?s=sporting-goods&ie=UTF8&qid=1509123167&sr=1-1&keywords=caliber+II+10+inch

Use your favorite motor mounts
Dual on 1 truck would probably work, but I like the setup of a diagonal setup (ie one on front right wheel and one on back left wheel)

thats not wide enough for a dual 6374 setup, @WARMAN the 218mm torqueboards trucks are the best option i have them on my Raptor with dual 6355 and i can fit my fist inbetween the motors it has so much space.

@WARMAN said 6374 motors in the first sentence, please read

torqueboards 218mm, or psycho's surfrodz with extended axels are the only two at the moment that will fit dual 6374. even then, makes sure they're not sk3 6374, they will not fit, ask @ARetardedPillow

Torqueboards wide trucks with 6355...it honestly looks kinda goofy with all the space in between...maybe I'll throw some 6374s on there. I have one laying around for a build

I also thought that it looked goofy with such a big gap, but I also remembered that a dual 6374 setup is 2 pounds heavier than a dual 6355 setup. Unless you need the power and don't care for the added weight, I would just stick with the 6355s.

Hi,
Reason you did not see the idlers because I am still waiting for my belts to come in.  What I have in the picture is version 1 of my motor mount (no idlers).  Version 2 has a dual idlers.  Note:  my setup is a TB218mm truck running a dual Turnigy 6374 motors, all 180mm trucks including Caliber, Ronin, Paris,... will not fit a dual 6374s.

Diy.com website says it will fit 2x 6374's 190kv side by side...so what your saying is confirming what I thought,you CAN run dual sk3's with 15mm belt/pulley setup,don't get why people are asking you how you done it??

TB 6374 motors have a length of 74mm which is why they make TB218mm truck for their motors in a dual setup.  Turnigy 6374 motors have a length of 86.3mnmn which I did not realize until I bought it.  I thought all 6374s have the same length, absolutely not the case!  With that in mind I engineered my motor mounts so I can accommodate my dual setup with up to ~90mm in motor width.

Two pounds? ...just two (2) pounds? That's less than 1 kilogram! Whats the big deal? If you start to consider that I weight 73 kilograms and you perhaps 10 kilograms (- +) than that, whats the big issue here? motor weight? what motor weight? People should be more concerned about their OWN WEIGHT which is relevant to the board's performance than anything else.

Lets say that you build the eboard without even consider your weight into account. Are you going tho sweat for a lousy extra motor kilogram because is just "there", than your own weight which was "there" much earlier than your boards conception (??)
```

## \#50 Posted by: cwazy1 Posted at: 2017-11-01T04:53:02.865Z Reads: 362

```
Firstly, no one compares board performance based on rider weight. People determine board performance BASED on their weight as it is completely relative to that one rider. Rider weight is a control variable when gauging performance of a board. Rider weight is not something most people can change with a turn of a knob.... The newly released 911 T is only 20 some odd pounds lighter than the base 911. Do they advertise the 911 T as being more performant than the base 911 for skinny people and less performant than the base 911 for heavier people? no. 

Secondly, 2 pounds, is on average 10% of a board's total weight. That is not an insignificant amount. 

Thirdly, the point with my original post was that its all about compromises. Heavy and more power isn't practical for everyone. On the flip side, light and weak also isn't practical for everyone. Depending on your specific use case, you'll slot somewhere in between. It doesn't matter where your use case might fit, so long as you recognize your need and build to it. In my case, 6355's with a 12s4p pack was plenty to get me the torque needed around my parts of town. Weighing in at 23 pounds, I have absolutely no desire to make it any heavier than needed. I commute on my board, I also work in an old ass building on the 11th floor. Sometimes the elevators don't come. Sometimes I take the stairs. If I can avoid carrying an extra 2 pounds over the course of however many hours I end up carrying the board, I will.

Did anybody try to mount two 6374 or bigger in diagonal on a single truck ? If yes I'd please  like to learn why it wouldn't work (given that people either mount under tail  or under deck the motors) cause I fail to see any issue.

Even a parallel dual mount with different lengths to squeeze tightly the 6374 should work on trucks like 180mm Paris?

[/quote]

@Vanarian what do you mean? this isn't possible! Diagonal is one each side on "different trucks"  it's possible to mount 2x 6374's on one smaller truck with one mount being way longer than the other,I think iv seen it done but being so long  it's got to be weaker,plus it just looks ugly!
Edit: I think you mean one underneath and one like an evolve?? Now that would be ugly!

Yes I mean that, one underneath on left and one evolve style on right, both mounted on the same truck. That's a Diagonal too, why not call it this way?

I think properly done it can be pretty cool looking. With even bigger / longer motors it would prove to be almost symmetrical looking. Or a cage like mount to protect them and make up for lack of symmetry. Just throwing ideas. 

BTW does anybody knows where to get 63100+ish motors?

@thisguyhere am I right in thinking your running dual 6374's with 15mm pulleys and belts? Just got my torqueboards trucks today but the pulleys don't fit like my old ones,the flange stops it from going in the wheel further,I'm guessing you have torqueboards pulley system too?

correct, but not using TB pulleys though, never have.

pulleys in the photo below is from @Titoxd10001, he might have more info on them. 

can't really picture what you mean when you say they don't fit.  even if the wheel pulleys doesn't sit flat against the wheel, the wide ass hanger length on the 218mm trucks should still have space to fit, i'm guessing.

There's not enough room for the pulley/wheel and get the nut on,the flange is far too big! The enertion pulleys I have sit slightly inside the wheel curve creating more space...here a pictures worth a thousand words.

Looks like I'll just have to trim the pulley down,they were free anyway with some wheels I bought in bulk.
Yeah looking at your photo yours do sit just inside that groove thanks for the photo @thisguyhere
You can see in this pic the slight wheel indentation! The bigger flange pulley doesn't fit snug!

What are the biggest 2 motors you can fit on 184mm calibers with 12mm belts? 6455? 6564?

Off topic, but okay.
6355 is the biggest possible

Which one my current board or the one I was riding over a year ago when I posted that?

Just to stay on topic the board length or width doesn't matter it's about truck width to fit bigger motors and the TB218 trucks are just that 218mm wide.

If you want to know how wide the deck is in the picture I'm not sure I don't have it anymore but it's a Raptor 1 deck I'm sure you can find the specs online.

Both. I have a Quest deck I'm looking at using but I plan on using dual 6374s. I'm not sure if running 218s will be awkward with the board I'd like to run

Im running the tb218 with the newer 6374sk3 which is actually 6384. I got both to fit on the tb218 trucks, using some spacers for the wheels.  ![20181201_231102|690x388](upload://eDp82CCgzx3BgUiaiDPynI5khwY.jpeg)
