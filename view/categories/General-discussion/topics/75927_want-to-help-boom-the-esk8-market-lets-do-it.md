I dont really have a plan, but im just rooting back to what got me to join the esk8 community. I saw a youtube video of a guy in a magic carpet, and that led me to like electric skateboards and its amazing community.
How did you get here?
[poll type=regular max=4]
* Joined esk8 because i saw it in a video
* Joined esk8 because i saw it the streets
* Joined esk8 because i stumbled upon it online
* Joined esk8 because a friend told me
[/poll]
Now, what got me here is just one video, imagine if the streets were filled with electric skateboards, or youtube with trending videos of electric skateboards, and taking this from a niche market to a worldwide one. We already have CaseyNeistat to thank along with other youtubers.

The half-baked plan here is simple, us owners, to do marketing and let companies build the quality stuff. just humble-brag about your skateboard, make videos about it, and if you are a company, sell stickers with links, QR codes for people to embed on their boards, or send youtubers some boards to try out.

Will you help?
[poll name=poll2 type=regular]
* Yes
* Yes but in white
[/poll]

I might be very wrong, hence the "half-baked" name. 
If you have any suggestions, please say em!

Don't build boards that exceed 30mph (48km/h) and the general public will like us more and feel less compelled to make laws restricting speed or power -- or our existance at all.  Because you know they'd choose 500W / 20mph (32 km/h) instead which we all know is ridiculous, especially the 500W part

if you really want a fast board, keep yourself from going at crazy speeds when people are around
And for gods sake wear helmets!

Or, build boards that are fast af, but use them responsibly and only flex when it won’t annoy/endanger drivers/pedestrians.

Just to be clear, I advocate *getting to* 30mph (48km/h) as fast as possible, but just topping-out there.  But I definitely need zero to max in 2 seconds :smirk:

In the weight class our vehicles are in, wouldn't getting to that speed that fast cause the front to lift up?

@kalebludlow proper weight distribution and  bindings would be a must to do that time. Has anyone actually timed their boards?

I'm sure I could forge a "nose guard" that could weigh a good 5-10 lbs lol... It'd be great for bombing hills xD
