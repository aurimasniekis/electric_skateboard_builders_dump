```
So I received order confirmation on the 31st of October but nothing else since. Since then I have placed a second order and have received the order confirmation and notification of shipment. In concern about my 1st order not going past confirmation of order I have attempted to contact both diyelectricskateboard and torque boards through social media and email and have had zero response other than automated email. 

Its been 3 days with no response and wanted to known if anyone here has had similar issues. Thanks in advance!
