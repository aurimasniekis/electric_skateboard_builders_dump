Joined in on this last month, there were over 500 bikes, blades & skates.

Last Friday of each month - next one is November 24th.

Meet at my studio @ 5:00pm for adult malted beverages - pre-party is my treat. 
Lock Haven park is 2 blocks from me. The ride leaves the park at 6:00pm.

My studio:
Guido Graphics
2510 N. Orange Avenue
Orlando, Florida 32804
321-438-1174
The small 1 lane alley, to right of my building, goes to private free parking in rear.

They only do 5 or 6 miles, but we can thrash downtown and hit some parking garages and area trails afterwards for those who want to keep going.

After party back at my studio - byob  (7-11 & a wine store are 1 block away)

Sounds like a blast. O-Town thrashing for the win.

It's a drive for me, but I might make it. I posted this on the Central Esk8 Squad Facebook group.

Instead of this thread being just for the November ride, we can try to do this ride monthly, I'll be there at each one I can make.
