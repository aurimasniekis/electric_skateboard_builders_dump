Hi Esk8 Community,
My friend who forgot to give me a birthday present back in October said he would get me a big Christmas present. To no surprise, that didn't happen either. He finally decided that he wanted to by me something after nearly four months. He asked me what I wanted and I said I didn't know but because he knew I love my electric-skateboard, he wanted to get me either a new deck, or sometime of penny board to convert to electric. If he were to get me a penny board, I would have to buy new parts like hub motors because all of my spare parts are meant for longboards. If I were to get a new longboard deck, I could use spare parts that I have like Orangatang Caguamas, Caliber II trucks, Motor Mounts, and an extra enclosure. The reason I'm reaching out to the community is because I want to find a deck that is good quality, large enough for bigger enclosures (@psychotiller) and doesn't break the bank. I also have the option to go half in with him on a deck too. Any recommendations any longboards that would be optimal for my situation?

I’m good to try out any decks, but currently, my electric skateboards use palisades decks but I want to try something new.

Budget: $150ish so I can go half in.

Enclosure: I’ll find one that fits to the deck, but one of the larger ones , nothing particular, but Alters Wedge size.

And I’ve already had two drop through and want something that isn’t drop through

I plan to move the front truck up about a half inch.
But it's basically getting the components from my Riptide. 12s2p (maybe 12s4p doublestack), dual vesc, Tkp surfrodz dual 6355 maytechs. 
Modified enclosure is a work in progress.

Oh right right.  Yeah Drang is good even though our web store is still broken we can help for sure, but you guys have given some good suggestions.  Earthwing rocks, Madrid has good boards, Pantheon makes some very excellent decks.  Omen Longboards.  FS Boards are all awesome.  We also do full customs. Choose your concave and depth, then choose your other features, rocker, drop, flare, w concave ect, and then choose your shape.  Yep, we do that and it's legit.  We have modular mold assembly kits which we use to make your board.  Then we laminate at 120 psi for a very strong long term bond. We don't pollute the air and we use top notch adhesives and sealants.

He said not drop-through.  But drop-through can be top-mounted also.  He didn't say not drop-down

The battery channels on the bottom will be a great help and you can just top-mount the drop-through part.  You could even use the extra space for lights or battery gauge or whatever

Love powell decks. And everyone needs a 30inch esk8. But sounds like he's trying to reuse some parts that won't fit that smaller deck.

My best suggestion would be to measure your components, go to the nearest store that sells longboard decks and try every deck that would fit your components. For me the feel of the deck is more important than the looks, you can’t feel the flex and the stance from an online picture. 

Good luck in finding a deck that suits you! And don’t forget to eventually let us know what you chose

That was my first esk8 build.
I have a 30q 12s4p flat pack from psychotiller but my deck is a single cut out.
I think all he has left are dual cutouts. 
Still great decks just gotta go about battery differently.

The dual could be better in certain circumstances.  Buying a premade battery is not one of those circumstances.

Having a physical barrier in the middle you could wire the P-packs the other way....
