Hey, ive done some googling and found out one should not use s nickel plated strip for hogh current batteries because of the resistance and heat it generates. But i was wondering could one use these kind of strips and reinforce them with copper wire ontopp to negate these energy wastes?

Kind regards

i guess its not strong enough for the welding... thats why u use pure nickel.

How do you mean in “not strong enough”?

pure nickel doesnt rust, and sure better ampacity... I just use one layer of nickel to parallel groups and use either silicone wire to gap the series groups..or flat braid works as well

So you are saying it can rust overtime when current is applied?

Every metal will rust, but Nickel will rust in many years. Chopper can rust in a few days...

better said yes... plated nickel rusts way easier if exposed to moisture which hopefully never happens but does....

I was wondering why nickel is used for welding cells together the other day. 

Lets insert some data into this debate:

So its more the moisture i should be afraid of.

Copper, Aluminium and even Iron all look like winners due to lower comparative electrical resistivity, however I would suspect that its not as simple as that.  

I would also suspect that the respective environment in which the metal is stored in would affect the choice as well.  Hopefully someone can enlighten us. :face_with_monocle:

copper is know to be the best for our application but spot welding it is difficult for most except for a select few... this is covered in MANY battery build thread and discussions... cost wise nickel is accessible and welds easily and works.
