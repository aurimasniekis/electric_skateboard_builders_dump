So I rode a boosted mini and I absolutely love the deck, it has pockets for your feet and it's super wide, I'd love to make a build with this deck especially since boosted performance is a bit lacking. 

Does anyone know if that deck is available only anywhere?

I'm fairly certain they have custom made those decks. You could either do some snooping around and find  out who is their manufacturer and contact them or you could see if boosted would like to give you a board for some $cashola$ (couldn't hurt to ask)

I'm gonna have to do that, it's honestly the best small deck I've ever ridden and I really want a small build now.

well it depends on your definition of "small" i'm working on a few builds rn. A 40",  30" and a 19". So if you are looking for a deck thats the same size deck as the boosted mini i would say go for the jet spud. If you're curious about the tiny 19" one its actually surprisingly good!

Hmm but jet spud doesnt have a kicktail, imo the closest I've found was a Landyachtz Tugboat but it's not as wide as the boosted deck.

This is a nice 30" board with a wide deck, bit of flex and and good price http://www.longboarderlabs.com/product/landyachtz-dodger-wing-9-x-30-deck/  I thought about using it but I go my hands on this deck and i love it (https://www.sickboards.nl/en/longboards/10417-bossa-platform-28-rio-deck-only.html#/232-flex-light)

Now that I think about it, it shouldn't be too hard to make a tail with wood before applying the grip tape and adding kind of a kick tail!

Yeah I would find the length you want and then look around. there are definitely some good decks around 30" with a kicktail. I would start the search with something like "30' kicktail cruiser skateboard" or something.

But then again if you ever do come through to boosted and get your hands on a deck please let up know!

I'm in no rush I need to finish my DIY project first but if I can I'd rather try to get a boosted mini deck.

I know right XD. Even though this is an older business I can personally attest to the quality of their mini cruiser and will be posting a build log for it in a week or so.

Oh you ment the R2 yeah well my Antispark switch popped for the second time it caused the board to jerk hard under full throttle I didn't fall but I did drop the remote and damaged it. They are sending me another antispark switch and a new Nano x remote. The do respond pretty fast.

My Old raptor 1 is the one with problems I mentioned earlier.

Didn't read all the discussion but to me a nice cruiser deck with kick tail kind similar to boosted mini are the globe decks. They are either 26,31or32 inches.
