As the title says, I need to remove this white stuff. It is on all of the components from alien power systems. This is a switch that will no longer turn off. Any solution I need to bathe the part in to remove it?![image|375x500](upload://2ZIpeJj4maIMhSbzr0vhC389lMZ.jpeg)

It is like rubber epoxy I usually just peel it off but if that doesn't work try epoxy remover
