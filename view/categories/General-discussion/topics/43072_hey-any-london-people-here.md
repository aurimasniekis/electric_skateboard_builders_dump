Howdie! A few Londoners here (myself included). Need to some repairs (this will motivate me to do so) and I'll be good as gold to join you for a ride. 

With the law, esk8s are a grey area and I'd recommend you stay on cycle lanes and be super considerate (mainly for your safety and that of others). Signal when looking to turn and wear a helmet. Common sense really. 

The closest I got to trouble was a police car followed me for about 2 miles on my way to work. I stayed under 15mph and they got bored and left me be. 99% of the time the police are chilled and can see I'm not making an ass of myself.

Londoner here too!

Yes definitely bring your board, the cycle lanes in central London are awesome and there are group rides happening regularly - it would be awesome to see you on one.

Check out the ESK8 UK facebook page  https://www.facebook.com/groups/eSk8UK/

The only time the police chatted to me was out the front of my house, and that was only because they couldn't work out why anyone would be wearing a full face helmet on a skateboard - i.e. WTF is that guy up to and is he up to no good (there are a lot of moped/motorbike thefts in London and acid attacks so the police are rightly being vigilant). Once they saw the motor they understood and wanted to chat about how cool e-skateboards :slight_smile:

Ah man I'm missing out! I don't have facebook but would love to join group rides. I jumped on the meetup page but that kinda died down. Guess FB is the way to go

Yeah FB is definitely a must for the group rides, it means people can update when late or if you are running behind we can tell you where we currently are.

It would be nice to have  a better representation from the DIY community on the rides, at the moment it's a sea of Evolve and boosted

You'll probably need a charger that caps off at 42V (or 41 if you charge your cells to 4.1V each to maximise cycles).

The usual deal is we pick a cool route, ride the streets of London stopping here and there for beverages of a refreshing nature ;)

[/quote]
that's because we have had great weather recently, usually it's 5 days rain, 1 day 10 mins sun  then rain - I wish i was joking :slight_smile:

If it rains it's time to cancel the ride, thane is slippy a all hell in the wet...
