What length mountain board do you use or recommend. I'm asking because I found one in my area for sale. It's an Atom 80 with an overall length of 35 inches. I'm not sure of it would be too short.

It's a little short but that depends on how tall are you. Because of the stance you need to be Confortable. 

I'm 6'2" and use a pro 95 overall 45"
Axel to axel 37.2"

Then it may be to too short for mexample, darnot but I may buy it anyway for how cheap it is and give it a try.
