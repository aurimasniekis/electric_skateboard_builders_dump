Sooooo...how is everyone doing? cool? This is my first thread in a while but an important one..

I have been testing and learning everything I can but I want to hear from you too. I have been going through many decks and swapping parts constantly to try and find the best combos and also testing robustness along the way. I have seen many common decks people keep mentioning and/or using for their builds, so I think there is a short list of the favorites or commonly used ones already.

 I've actually been tasked with creating a more complete list to aid the industry and help get us more of what we need, so give it to me straight...

Here I will start:

The Evo
The potato
The bamboo dancer
The hybrids

I want to know 2 things so lay it on me thick

-What is your favorite eskate deck? (specific make and model)

and if it doesn't exist yet

-What features would it have? (length, width, concave profile, shape and features)

The @Hummie deck is amazing for me.  I love the drop through and the CF keeps it rigid enough.  The battery compartment keeps the profile slim so that even in drop through I have plenty of ground clearance.  The shape also allows for an AT setup.

Earthwing Team/Muirderer
Potato 33
Cantellated Tesseract

Happens to be the decks I used on my builds.. so I'm subjective :) 

Important to me: kicktail, length <37", big flares for big wheels

it really depends on your needs. Since my (main) board needs to fit in my locker and be small af i've chosen a eggboard and I love it. one thing that I have seen consistently throughout boards, regardless of size, length etc. is width, a good board has width.

My favorite to date is Hummie's deck, it's thick and sturdy, not flexy and is the only double drop to last longer than 3 months with me riding.

The one I am now looking at is from Red Ember Boards and it's called The 44, I like long decks and The 44 is just calling to me, but gotta wait til he says they're for sale :/

This is my current setup (non-powered at the momemt) the wide axles are so i can swap between 100mm and 6" wheels

Powell-Peralta Bones Brigade Series 10 Mike McGill Skull and Snake Reissue (the bottlenose skakeskin)
![680a84cec88e6eec50dd9bae72426d3b|333x499](upload://rd87EaVH7lFsLfxh0NyTlhuHVso.jpeg)

It has a **massive tail**, is **short** enough (30.5", 77.5cm) to be carried upright by a handle on the nose, and is **super-wide** (10", 25.4cm) **right under the front foot** for stability at-speed.  It's the best commuter deck EVER and is super-awesome on trains and in grocery carts(trolleys).

The second runner-up sharing all of these features is the Powell-Peralta Bones Brigade Series 10 Lance Mountain Future Primitive Reissue

@mmaner once told me that every serious builder does something with a RedEmber Bludgeon... for good reason.  They are awesome.

But I also love the Lacroix, tailor made for eskate.

@barajabali I too cannot wait to get my hands on the Ollin Recurve...

Its hands down the best deck I've ridden for extended periods, its a frikkin tank and its comfortable...looks bad ass too.

I rode @Sender's thane Lacroix yesterday and I'm a little jealous I don't have one, that thing is epic. 

I haven't ridden @Hummie's deck a ton, but the couple of hours of ride time I have on it is very impressive.  The thing is incredibly well balanced, the concave and the drops are very gradual.  For lack of a better word and at the risk of getting flamed, the ride quality is 'sublime'.

I still feel like the LY TopSpeed is one of the best thane decks every made for esk8 that wasn't specifically made for electric skateboard use.

I like the deck a lot, it's very comfortable, but at 38 inches I'm so spread out I feel like my man bits are a wind sock :slight_smile:.  The only real complaint I have is that the wheelbase is tiny for the size of the deck, the trucks sit very far inside.  

I think the rum runner would be a better fit.

The Boosted Mini X was such a huge disappointment that, in all sincerity, I wouldn't replace it at half the cost.

This build was selected to make it easy to skate; very forgiving design.

Thanks for the tip @squishy654 on the Akashas - we'll go Smurfy this Halloween.

Some decks that I've been riding recently on some production esk8s and DIY which I absolutely love.  

Landyatchz Ten Two Four 
Landyatchz Wolf Shark 
Landyatchz Switchblade 40"
Powell-Peralta Kevin Reimer Samurai

I prefer to have decks that are 36-38" in length being 5' 8" and also 9.5"-10" in width.  I like decks that have micro drops to lock your foot in and also W's to give my toes something to dig. It's important to find your style and base your deck selection on that.

This ^

The micro drop w-concavity is my favorite at the moment. Note as the drop gets bigger stay away from inner mount belt drivetrains. Instead go with reverse mounted belt drivetrain , direct drive or reverse mounted gear drive and use risers.

Hey I'm new here and am going to build my first DIY esk8 soon. I have done research and because I really wanted hub motors after riding the raptor 2 I bought some hummie hubs and a focbox unity. I really want a flexy deck because the roads near me are pretty crap and the riding experience seems better for me. I am just not sure if it is safe to run a flexy deck 30+ mph. I am currently thinking about the Loaded Vanguard flex 2 beacuse 42 in. deck but idk. Any suggestions? thanks.

I would say that we are at a point in which integrated and purpose built decks will become the norm.  If you look at the logistics and cost of producing an enclosure for a specific deck then it becomes prohibitive.  You have to keep up with current trends and produce along those lines.  Unless you're Alan in which case you can set that trend by building something using a specific unit and guarantee that a damn good proportion of new builds will use the deck you last did.  
@squishy654 
Integration is the future of esk8 and I'm guessing that this is the whole point of this thread.

I actually see a different trend.  A trend towards "toys" and "tools".  A lot of folks want 15S75P batteries and 22" tires for a board that weighs 75kg and can climb Pikes Peak in 2 minutes but only when it's sunny and dry and hot.  These are not practical for daily use as a tool, but I think it's important to distinguish between the two.  A cheap China hub motor board isn't practical either, because reliability is King in the "tool" world -- nothing is more important.

toy: fast, far, tires
tool: reliable, light, polyurethane

And the deck choices I think will begin to mirror this... the integrated deck choices maybe even ;-)  (just as soon as someone learns to put the enclosure lid on the bottom, because water travels downhill)

For me personally the Landyachtz Switchblade will always be my favorite eSkate deck. You can get either the 36”, 38”, or 40” deck to have it perfectly cater to your stance and have foot pockets to lock your feet in place during hard acceleration and breaking.

It’s not as low as the Evo when top mounted so I can easily fit a double stack 12s5p battery underneath with large wheels and some 1/4 inch risers. Plus, when I top mount the deck I can use the hole where the trucks would go as a perfect spot to put a battery meter so I can easily judge my range without getting off the board. Great for 20+ mile rides.

Here are a few old pictures.i really new to take new ones sometime since I upgraded to an eswitch and better cable management.

When you hit things at 30 mph on a flexy deck, instead of the board jumping as one piece and being pushed up onto your feet harder, it oscillates, think about a trampoline. There's a fair chance it'll send you flying off. And the top is so flat, no concave. Not a great way to be locked in @dougpage

Stiff downhill boards can also get the wobbles at high speeds due to bad truck/bushing setup or poor technique. A flex board at high speeds would be more difficult to control compared to a stiffer one.

[quote="Bundymus, post:31, topic:70264"]
I prefer to have decks that are 36-38" in length being 5’ 8" and also 9.5"-10" in width. I like decks that have micro drops to lock your foot in and also W’s to give my toes something to dig. It’s important to find your style and base your deck selection on that.
[/quote]

Also a fan of this.  I haven't ridden many decks but Madrid Trapstar will always be it for me.  The drop at the front and the narrower W at the rear without a drop just feels right.  I have 7 degree Khiro shock pads to keep the front baseplate at 50 and the rear at 43.  Anything else just feels wrong.

Here's the 3 best Subsonic boards for electric builds. 

Subsonic boards can all be ordered as custom builds, including different maple ply counts for flex, and carbon fiber, or fiberglass layers,  and custom staining.   Every board is CNC cut and shaped for accuracy and hand crafted for a furniture grade finish.   
 
Century 40 is a drop deck with lots of room for batteries because of its length.   You can order it with extra plys, or carbon fiber and/or fiberglass layers to make it stiff,  or if you want some flex we can adjust,  based on rider weight.   The rear has a second set of truck mount holes to allow for zero degree setup, and can also be used for rear mount belt motors. 
Talon is available as a 36 or 37 inch board.  It is a drop deck that has a small kick tail, and an appealing shape.  eBoosted offers an enclosure for the  37 Talon.  Make sure we know that you are interested in electric skateboards,  so we send you the 37 inch one. Talon can also be customized for flex, composite layers, and finishing. 
Spirit 30 has a more aggressive kick tail,  and smaller size for easier carrying and storage.   It probably won't take enough batteries to go long distances,  but would make a great short distance commuter using hub motors.

If you would like to see eBoosted enclosures for Century 40 and Spirit let me know and we will look into it.

### [Century 40 Longboard Deck or Complete](https://www.subsonicskateboards.com/collections/factory-decks-completes/products/century-40-longboard-deck-or-complete)

“Subsonic Skateboards Production Century 40 longboard: Hybrid Push-Pump, 2 inch dropped platform, 7-ply maple w/ embedded fiberglass, wedge/dewedge system”





The 2 inch dropped platform makes esk8 more prone to impacting motors. With risers and reverse mount, it will help. I like dropped down decks, I lean toward micro drops. Drops are for pushing/pumping, not a lot of pushing on esk8.

The deck is camber. Camber and high speed do not mix well. Negative camber(rocker) or flat would be my choice.

This deck could be used at cruiser speeds, don’t recommend for high speeds.

I have a Talon 37 and GT 40 on order with @Subsonic_Paul and I've ordered carbon-fiber tops for both Subsonics because I expect the necessary torsional rigidity to be there with carbon fiber (at the expense of a little concave, naturally).

Our 2019 T37-6380 "Lightfighter" prototype will be a @psychotiller 13S3P with @tabbytabb's ARC200 in an @Eboosted enclosure, driving a single @torqueboards 6380 (or the new TB Dual Direct Drive) turning Dexter's new 110s.  

Keeping it pure. :)

That is a monster setup!

T37 is a great choice for that setup. Personally I have not been on a board with tapered concave. I like how it’s less drop over the century, concave, and wedge/dewedge.

I currently own a nice Century 40 with Don't trip poppies on it and 85mm mango speedvents. I had to use risers just to get the sides of the deck from hitting the ground when pumping and I feel it would be a poor eskate due to the drop and lack of clearance for the battery and motors. If it was a micro drop, sure it would be nice for eskating but it's just too low.

As for other Subsonic decks, highly recommended, they make some of the best decks I've seen in the market and they listen to customers and they custom make just about anything you want..these guys are are a class act!

The prism origin decks are sick.

They feel like the Jet decks but a bit longer, space enough for 10s4p and dual vescs if you use a small riser they work well with up to 93mm wheels (If such thing exists)

Damn stable, and a dream to build on.

The kicktail is quite functional.   With a little practice you get very maneuverable with it.   Keep your back foot forward when you accelerate or you can lift the front wheels.

Enclosures don't worry me too much, I've had what I'd like to think is a really good outcome with my first fibreglass attempt on my current build. Quite enjoyed the whole process so looking forward to making another enclosure!

That said the current one hasn't been road tested. 🤣
