What motor amps are you guys running your 6355, 200 Kv motors at?  Most retailers list them at 80A, is that roughly what you guys are using?

I run 80a but that's alot of power if you are not used to rideing esk8 I'd start at 40a and work your way up.

I don't at this point, I'm waiting for something that can do data logging but for now I only have info from my Raptor 2. I set it at 80a motor amps and with hard launches I'd see spikes up to 135amps I am heavy though.
