Since today I cannot login with my mobile using chrome. Works fine with Firefox browser. 
Anyone else having this problem? Displays "unknown error" while trying to login

Well what the fuck. I was replying to someone here and couldn't post what I wrote. Then I got kicked out.
Cleared cache and stuff but didn't help

Sorry if you had issues, I have forced https across entire site, It took a bit of fuckery but should be working properly now.

Its Supposedly better for security or something...

I had a lot of problems this morning too.
I couldn't like or post anything.
I thought i was banned for being too cute but seems it was some site momentary failure.
Working flawless now.

I have to constantly refresh the page now and sometimes it doesn't let me hit the reply button, I'll have to refresh a bunch of times till it works.
