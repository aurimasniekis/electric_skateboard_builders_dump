No joke. I can't keep up.

This is a paid/Part time local position. (Actually 2 locations sometimes) 1 to 2 days per week.

$100 a day paid to your paypal account. Or $140 per workday in store credit. Your workdays will be 6 hours.

In addition to pay, you will learn how to: solder, vacuum form, make molds for enclosures, assemble completes, and prep battery builds.

We have 3d printers, vacuum formers, cnc mills, cnc lathes, presses, a wood mill, a reflow oven, and a ton of experience. 

If you're a SoCal Resident, 18 years of age, have a little longboarding experience, a strong work ethic, and a desire to learn get in touch!
