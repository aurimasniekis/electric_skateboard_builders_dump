I've read that on Reddit, don't know when they did get that info though. 

I really hope they come up with a beefier 74A 97mm flywheel instead of a skinnier 107mm

Well that would be wonderful, allowing us to use the standard ABEC11 hub drives, although I wont be using 107mm.

Competition is good for the consumer :joy:
