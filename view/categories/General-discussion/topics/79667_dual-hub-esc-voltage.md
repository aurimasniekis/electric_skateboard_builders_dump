Hi guys,

I was looking at doing a dual hub motor build, simply because it suits my budget at this point. 

My question is: have any of you did the “hack” where you are able to change the input voltage from 6s, 7s and 10s?

I see Mboards have stock, but it’s only the 10s version 

Thanks 
Mark

Depends how fast u want to go.   If u drop the voltage will go slower.

Not too concerned about speed at this point

Happy if I’m able to get between 15 and 20km/h?

honestly would go 10s straight away and simply use less throttle. ez
you'll be sick of 6s in a day
