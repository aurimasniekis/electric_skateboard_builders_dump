Well here in Socal most places except maybe McDonald's as far as I can find has no plugs for customers so thought maybe there is some specific business you guys know of.

Public and University Libraries, bookstores. Pretty much anywhere you can go sit down with a notebook and it be normal.

I didn't think about the library and I guess even those internet cafes huh. Great thanks bro now I got a good plan to go a long a distance. I have 3 swapping batteries so maybe 30 miles and with a one charge or two I can ride all day. Nice ðŸ‘Œ
