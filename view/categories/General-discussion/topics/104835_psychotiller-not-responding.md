I made an order on september 9 that was never fulfilled, and I emailed him about a month later to ask if he can cancel it so I at least get my money back. After responding, 'okay sure', I never heard from Dave again. I've emailed him a number of times afterwards, and I've messaged his instagram to no avail. Does anyone know if theres any other way I can get ahold of him? I've been down 860 dollars from this order and despite all the great reviews he's gotten, I honestly feel like he just stole my money. 

Any advice?
