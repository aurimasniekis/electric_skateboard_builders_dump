Hey so as you can probably guess I am new to this. I already have a board, have all the tools necessary. I am looking for a commute board with a 6 or more km range, that can do light climbing and that can do about 30-35 km/h. I could get access to a 2m by 2m CnC and I am very comfortable with electronics.  So my questions are:

-Are Hub motors even an option? ( I found some dual motor ones with 500w on Aliexpress for 70€)
-Can you trust cheap (20€) motor mounts?
-How can I figure out what batteries I need?
-Is a single motor even a decent option?
-is the Hobbyking® X-Car 120A Brushless Car ESC (sensored/sensorless) still up for the task or do I need a different one?
-What motor would you recommend on my budget?
```

Would the motors that are discussed here https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/those-cheap-6374-motors/88092 work?

I would not trust those 70e hubs, just go single drive, flipsky vesc, and a mount from @Boardnamics

To save cost, make your own motor mount. It doesn’t need to be cncd just use a hacksaw drill and file. Make the plate out of 6mm or more aluminium or 3mm steel and then make the clamp out of 10mm or more aluminium. You can use scrap metal for this as I did and it will cost about $4. 

I would either go single drive with a Keda 6364 motor. Some hobbyking trucks, the custom mount, pulleys or chains. 

Or you can choose the dual hub motors like the ones meepo and wowgo use, these can be found for a similar price to the part total above, but it will mean you need either a dual vesc or two single escs. 

For the battery try and get a cheap meepo or wowgo/ownboard battery (the 6.0 one) this will have a max current draw of 40a. Otherwise you will have to go with a Lipo set up.

For this price get a complete Meepo/ownboard/verreal/etc. It will have more range than you need and it will be cheaper than diy

Buy the ownboardkit with samsung 6.0Ah battery.

You only need your own deck and everything else is included.

Esk8 is expensive, no way around it. If you build a dumpster board with only the cheapest parts, it's just going to suck. Save yourself a lot of frustration (and money in the long term) by buying better parts the first time, rather than getting the cheapest shit and then buying good stuff once the cheap shit inevitably breaks.

Boardnamics mounts are good. If you can't afford the $20, then make your own on your CNC. Either is better than aliexpress. 

A single 6355 motor is acceptable, and can be upgraded later to dual.
Don't use RC ESCs, they suck. Use a vesc-derivative. If possible get something based on 6.x, the 4.x (especially the cheap ones) have issues.

LiPo batteries are cheap, but you will have shit range. If you want more range, go li-ion. Yes, they're expensive. Yes, they're worth it.

So my plan so far is to buy as much as possible so the motors and motor mounts used on the forum, the only thing I am struggling to find any deals is the vesc, what is the cheapest one that i can go for and where should I buy it?
