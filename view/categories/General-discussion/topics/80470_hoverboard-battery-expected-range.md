I pulled a battery from an old hoverboard, it's a 10s2p 4.4ah battery. Looking at the cells it seems to be Samsung 25r. 

What range can I expect with it?

I'm running a dual motor 190kv with 4.12 vescs set up, slick revolution 83mm wheels and I'm 100kg (220 lbs)

The only limiting factor I can see is the BMS which I'm not sure about in terms of max discharge. It's a charge and discharge BMS. 

Thanks

Find out the capacity of the 25r and then calculate everything here by your own
