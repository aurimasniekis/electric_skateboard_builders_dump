Dear members, I am not sure if this is a questions and or a statement but I need some opinions. At this moment I would like to start a new build. Yes it's a new eBoard build.

From my experience of hub motors and belt drive motor, both system offer advantages and disadvantages. Also having a longboard it's self have advantages and disadvantages along the way... So after 1 year, here are my remarks.

Let me start with eBoard
- eBoard is way more portable than eBike
- eBoard is lighter, smaller makes it easy to transport and store (public transport)
- eBoard is not lockable at public places
- eBoard easily get scratched or damaged due to low ground clearance
- eBoard easily get dirty from every ride
- eBoard deck is commonly made from wood which is prone to breaking when often in contact with water
- eBoard with Aluminium and CF base are more expensive
- eBoard are a pain to carry around in the city

HUB Drive vs Belt Drive
- HUB is silent
- HUB can be water tight (Lofty hub motor)
- HUB has less rolling resistance, especially when battery is flat out
- HUB provide higher top speed but lower torque for hill climbing
- HUB cover easily get damaged (I think less dmg on Carvon series as they snug deep inside the wheel)
- HUB has less range if not driven at optimum speed (high speed = longer distance)
- HUB has limited wheel size and color option

So what do I think of an ideal board:
- Portable, light weight - carryable in the city all the time while walking around
- Dual drive, just because I love the setup
- Water proof deck
- HUB driven just because of the rolling resistance and stealth, but upgradable with all terrain wheels setup
- HUB cover or body didnt get easily damaged (I hate small scratches over my board)
- Stealth please

Why not eMountainboard?
- They are not stealthy (Police can easily see it through and stop you then ask you for a fine you don't want to pay)

What I think now as an option
- eBoard deck with waterproof protection or using aluminium and or CF
- HUB that have longboard wheels and swappable to all terrain wheels (80/90mm / 3inch / 5inch)
- HUB wheels that offer at least 3 varieties of colors (Black, Orange, Blue)
- Water thigh HUB motor
- Slightly higher ground clearance to avoid scratches

Opinion? What do you think?

I don't think the deck is the problem with contact with water, it's the bearings.
I think if you're gonna get the board wet enough on a constant basis where it's a problem, other things will break before the deck does

My deck just got busted cracking all over the place, especially where the trucks and motor are mounted. Strange indeed. But atm I am more concerned with all terrain - urethane swappable hub motor.

I think you're somewhat overly concerned with trivial matters here - sure if you ride your skate in a monsoon day after day early grabbing off roofs and such, it might become waterlogged and/or break, but I suspect you'd be surprised at how much punishment a properly built and finished maple deck can withstand. Also who cares about scratches? It's a skateboard.
