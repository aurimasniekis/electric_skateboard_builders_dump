Hey, UK people, where are you getting your battery packs from for your builds? 
I want to do a build/assemble, but can't find anywhere in the UK that supplies battery packs or makes them to order. 
Trying to avoid import tax and duty.

I'm currently building a 10s3p 30q with a bestech BMS with eswitch. It's £250 which seems like a lot but the BMS was 60 shipped!![IMG_20180808_192728|666x500](upload://xlLrT3OxkZRX1qGeuLgVj3QMwKk.jpg)

PWRboards. Got mine from there after cancelling my Kevin Dark one after waiting  over 2 months.

Quick, extremely helpful and well made.

I like the list. Is the £50 welder the arduino one? I'm seriously considering moving to pcb soon but it's extra width in all

Just a manual button switch for now. Don't plan on upgrading since I think its pretty easy to use manually.

I was talking about this - https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/18650-pcb-designs/45577

The added thickness is very minimal, considering that some bms are like 22mm thick I dont think it matters if you add a little thickness to the cells

Fair enough yeah. More PCB is less padding though for non stacked BMS builds
