Does anyone have experience buying parts from Aliexpress?

like [this](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/Electric-Skateboard-HoverBoard-Longboard-DIY-Single-Drive-Remote-Control-Skatebaord-Kit-With-PU-Wheels-And-Trucks/32813541180.html?spm=2114.search0204.3.93.22ee7326R8Dcuc&ws_ab_test=searchweb0_0,searchweb201602_3_10152_10151_10065_10344_10130_10068_10547_10342_10343_10340_10548_10341_10696_10084_10083_10618_10139_10307_5711215_10313_10059_10534_100031_10103_10624_10623_10622_10621_10620,searchweb201603_25,ppcSwitch_5_ppcChannel&algo_expid=ab9d3ae4-6cf2-4432-b941-44f62a97d069-14&algo_pvid=ab9d3ae4-6cf2-4432-b941-44f62a97d069&priceBeautifyAB=0) one here. I am looking for a short truck to fit on a penny/nickel board, mounting a motor is questionable because of the board size, so I think thinking to buy a hub motor with a short truck, and Aliexpress seems to be the only place that are selling it.

some of the aliexpress items can be found on ebay also, easier to get replacements for defective merch this way.. through aliexpress you are lucky if they hit u back up when stuff broken

You just get refunded on aliexpress without any proof, just don‘t abuse it cause it only works if you are a trusted buyer
And ebay has same shipping time if they send from oversea and it‘s more expensive most of the time

Correct me if I'm wrong but I think this thread belongs in general discussion, not builds.

Buyer beware. I have had some really good experiences. Some sellers bend over backwards for your business and sell quality stuff. Some don't know what you are talking about if you ask a question that isn't on their spec sheet. I got confident bought a TeamGee Penny board. Dual hub! Decent power motors 250wh. Total BS. 72wh batt single hub motor showed up. TeamGee said that it was a "domestic only" and they were going to contact the seller. I raised a dispute with AliExpress and it's been going on for months. Ali says they are on my side and should expect the refund to come shortly. But with no phone number or direct contact and I am pretty sure that I am talking to a robot (legit customer service algorithm....works good but spooky). I sent the board back. So I am out of pocket for the original purchase and shipping back and I don't know where the board is. Just be careful. If they sell Esk8s all day and respond quickly and reviews of the seller are five star.....

It's typically pretty good. They respond on Wechat, which is an app kind of like Facebook Messenger, but in China. Sometime they prefer that. Otherwise, I have found some very legitimate and trust worthy suppliers. The Chinese value relationship and so the better you treat them, the better they'll treat you.

As with anything, just make sure they have a good seller rating. Most of them are just trying to make it and so they want to make sure you give them good feedback.
