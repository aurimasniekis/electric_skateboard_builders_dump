My sky RC charher charges at 2 amps when I set it to charge at 6 amps. Is this normal?  I am charhing 2 3s batteries In series. When I charge one at a time it charges at 4 amps.

A better way of think about the capabilities of a charger is to think of it in terms of wattage. The B6 is capable of 50 watts so 2 amps at 6s is what I would expect.

Yeah, you'll want an iCharger 208B + 350W Power Supply about $160 total if you want much faster charging. I can charge in parallel and charge about 15 amps or at least that's what I charge at.
