Hey all,

So I've begun the process that is my first build. I've figured out what I'm going to be using for a lot of the non-electric parts, but I need some help determining my motor/battery combo. I'm going to run a single motor set-up on this first build to simplify things, but there a lot of options if you're just going with one motor. Here's what I need help determining.
* Motor kV rating
* Motor size (6374 vs 6355)
* Battery size/type 
I live in a relatively flat area and would like my board to be on the faster end (approx. top speed of  25 mph/40 kph). Range is not as big of an issue for me, but ideally at leat 10 miles/16 km would be appreciated. 
If anyone has a single motor setup that's worked well for them, I'd love to see your work. Any and all thoughts are appreciated.

-MH

Thanks for the advice. Out of curiosity, why the 190 kv over a larger kv rating? Is it to keep the motor from getting too hot?

190kv at 10s stays below the 60k ERPM limit but gives  sufficient torque and speed.

```
The torque, it's the difence between kick pushing off and starting and stopping and being able to go on a hill

I really appreciate the tips guys. I'll be sure to upload photos once I start putting all the parts together.
