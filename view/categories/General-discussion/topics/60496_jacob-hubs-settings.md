Hey resident experts, I have recently acquired some jacob hubs and while my first impression was not great once I started to test them out properly I am changing my mind so a little input from someone else familiar with these would be great;

What settings can I get away with using vesc bldc?

Is that the best option?

How can I get the best out of these?

Can I run 12s?

At the moment I have the motor settings on 60 amp and battery at 25 amp on 10s 3p lg cells no bms and things are pretty cool so long as I don't climb anything too steep.

There was a manual the hubs came with - it has all the recommended settings inside - look around I have uploaded it here somewhere I think
