Motor Controller: https://www.enertionboards.com/electric-skateboard-parts/FOCBOX-programmable-brushless-motor-controller/

Bluetooth Module: https://www.amazon.ca/DSD-SH-HC-08-Bluetooth-Transceiver-Compatible/dp/B01N4P7T0H/ref=sr_1_2_sspa?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1533348277&sr=1-2-spons&keywords=bluetooth+module&psc=1

If it doesn't work with the FOCBOX than what does?

That one won’t work as you need an HM10. I sell a plug and play adapter that will work perfectly. Stock set to arrive on Tuesday.
