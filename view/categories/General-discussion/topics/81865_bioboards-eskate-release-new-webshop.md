All Boards except Radium will have the possibility to choose between glass grit or Seismic Lokton Lasercut Metal Plate gripetape.

Boards that are ordered to USA, Canada and Australia will be shipped to @longhairedboy who builds and install the batterys and then shipped to the customer. He will also be our repair agent for those countrys. 

So board with battery we will ship to EU, USA, Canada and Australia. But we do sell them all without battery and ship worldwide.

We will also sell some parts and accessories to, but from beginning it will not be a lot.

Hypothetically speaking, what-*ish* is your capacity for order volume? Say this blows up, cause these are sweet, and you get 50 orders in the first week... Will we be waiting for months to years on backlog to even be able to place an order?

Whats the price range? I'm assuming $2000+

Can't wait to see the site and options. Will there be extensive or minimal customization options?

You can see on the mailchimp url the preorder delivery plan. But to start we can do around 10-14 per month. But we can easy increase to 20 per month if needed. 

Also longhairedboy can build some for us if we get to many orders since he will already building the batterys for US/Canada/Australia market. But this is high performance with the best parts available so it have a high price. 

Yes its ~2000-4000 USD price tag (~1700-3200 without battery) so we don´t except that many orders, at least not to begin with before reviews and more users tried them.

The options to begin with except the 6 different versions will be:
Gripetape(glass grit or locton gripetape)
On Thorium deck 90A or 93A riptide bushings
Metr Pro will be included in the Thorium deck and for Uranium and Radium it will be a optional addon

They all have Focbox Unity and Samsung 30Q cells and a Bms with discharge (60A, 100A and 150A)

Here is more specs on them:

**Top speed and range are indicated up to these values. Top speed depends on wind, road surface, weight, exact motor KV and slope on the road. Range depends on wind, road surface, weight, slope on the road and driving mode (speed/acceleration).*

Very sweet. Some pretty heavy boards there. My hummie setup with 6374 12s6p sr rkp weighs 12.6kg. 

For the range I’d change it to half the value of what is mentioned with an up to value.

Great! It will be nice to see some nice boards around. Which deck do you use fur the radium? Is the Thorium deck pressed by you? Planning to sell the deck alone or make new models, maybe with a pocket to host hardware? Like hummie's deck. Well done.

Thanks! No it's a Landyachtz Evo we paint and mill for the bms and battery.
The other decks is Landyachtz switchblade 36 and Bkb Tayto. 
No plan to sell the decks since all can already buy them from the once who make them. Maby we can sell the evo with "milled" (or how do you say it on English?) for electronics and painted by Bioboards later if their is a interest for it.

Good like that :smile:. I thought you said you were making EVO clone deck for your board. The combination with the enclosure will be pretty sick. Since Eboosted enclosure go through the custom to get here. So if you already have them would be way better for EU fellow. Anyhow I totally understand that you want to make complete boards only. At least at the beggining :grin:

Love these boards. Great components and serious performance on offer. The only thing, and this is a personal preference, is using a drop through deck and top mounting on the Radium. I just don't think this looks 'right' as there are so many other top mount decks to choose from out there. But anyhows, what do I know lol ?

Best of luck with the new business and hope you sell 1000s :)

Thanks! We actually think it looks cool to see the cables over the truck on the rear. But if you don't like it it's just to add a top plate over the holes.

Awesome work man. I've been keeping on eye on your build for a while. Happy for you to get to this point!

My only question is why the nano-x? I've found it has one of the worse feels for controlling a powerful board. There's just a sudden all or nothing feel to it. Even a cheap 2.4ghz mini trigger has a better throttle feel.

Thanks, the reason is because i never ever did have a cut out on my nano-x and on rides i continue to see other getting cut outs sometimes, specially in the city with different other remotes. Sure it does not have any cool features but i found it most reliable and long battery life. So i prefer that over cool features.
And i like the feeling from it but that could be that i´m so used to it to ofc.

But if someone don´t like it and buys another remote for it i´m happy to help them how to install the other remote if they don´t know how to.

It's a nice compact remote. I've found the mini trigger to be the same case. Very reliable, never a drop but it has a smoother throttle range.

Any ways, keep up the great work!

Do that.

If possible, use cpanel as it makes it so much easier to do website stuff.
If not there is also webmin, but that is just not as good.

FYI, the part restocking update with "I understand" does some crazy attempt at rescaling on mobile (Android). It jumped around left to right getting bigger and smaller till it eventually settled on being split down the middle of the left screen edge.

you might want to look into squarespace as a website host if you do not have a full time website expert on your team.

Its not that much for a business account ~$250/year? (which allows you to have a "store" with payment processing built in)

You do not want to be dealing with android screen size scaling issues or server crashes etc.

I'm using them right now, and for the typical "small business" it is more than adequate and has a lot of great features.

You're not willing to sell me one of the EVO decks you guys modify are you? I already have all of the other (and pretty much the same ones you guys use) components for a build I'm in the middle of and have been trying to find a deck like this... something EVO like (or like the Omen "Chief" or a longer Subsonic "Talon" deck) with not much luck so figured I'd ask and hope for the best.... lmk.

I see that you do not provide this https://www.bioboards.se/en/produkt/geared-powertrain-7200w/
with the AT wheels option. What will be the cost of total rear system with all terrain wheels and the hubs, mounts?
Or do Ihave to get all those separately from @3DServisas? Also why does it always show $150 for shipping to the US even if it's not the complete board?
```

Hi, the 150 for shipping complete is just for complete skateboards since all boards is shipping first to longhairedboy. You should be able to choose DHL Express to if you write your adress in. I am working on coding to hide that option if the complete skateboard is not in the cart.

I have been working to add following shippers so it will be alot cheaper thene DHL Express if you prefere lower price, following have been added: UPS, Fedex, Db schenker (eu only) and Postnord ( eu only)

For the gear kits i have added package size that is needed for UPS and Fedex to show up in the checkout.
Next week i will add package size for all products so its possible to choose Fedex and UPS for all products (and DB schenker and Postnord for EU).

If you want just the gear or want to build all yourself and cut motor axle i recommend you to order direct from 3dservisas.

But here is the gear kits for AT, AT4wd and Abec11 2wd:
For AT front truck is included. I also added riptide bushings and pivots to all kits.
**I ordered a new batch of motors, they will come with longer motor cables and longer sensor cable with correct vesc connection so no adapter is needed!**

Hi Thanks for your reply. I am looking to buy this 
https://www.bioboards.se/en/produkt/power-kit-7200w-all-terrain-with-hubs-and-front-truck/

When I go to checkout the total cost shown is $1,458.00 and I choose FedEx shipping for $57 bringing my total to $1515. Does this cost include EU VAT as shows, then why am I not seeing the cost without the EU VAT?  

Also what will be the cost of buying an additional set of Abec 11 pulleys added to this order so I can use both the AT wheels and the street wheels?
```

Their is no adapter from AT to Abec11, change wheel like that from AT to abec11 would make the board very slow and a insanely high acceleration, the gearing and motors KV is made for bigger wheels. What country are you ordering to and I can check what the total price will be with shipping if you are not sure about the price?

Then you will not pay any VAT, you maybe will need to pay something to your customs, but no vat in our checkout, so the price would be 12030 kr (~1299 USD) with shipping included (tested a random Seattle adress)
That is without the extra options of tyres included. 

Please also check the shipping information so you understand how the order time is working atm, but actually we will be abel to ship power kits by the end of April and not end of May like that info is telling. So we will ship your order as latest end of April.

Don't forget to add in order comment what vesc you will use.

If you see eu vat on the product page it will disappear when  you go to the checkout and choose USA as the adress.

It have the same size as 2018 but they call it Landyachtz Evo Falcon 40.

Thanks to @3dservisas it's now possible to convert a Bioboards with abec11 wheels to all terrain wheels that you can buy here: https://haggyboard.com/collections/wheels-tires-tubes/products/bergmeister-all-terrain-complete-pneumatic-wheel-set-150mm-diameter

So for all you who have ordered a Abec11 wheel Bioboard or thinking of ordering it and maybe want to try AT wheels in the future you now have the possibility, the adapter will cost around 40USD for 2wd or 80USD for 4wd.
This will increase the topspeed by ~20% and same amount of acceleration will be lost, but I don't recommend to go faster thene the topspeed with Abec11 wheels even thought you can because the board and gear is already designed for the topspeed it comes with.

Here are the abec 11 wheels boards:

Its a big day for Bioboards! Thank you all for pre ordering! We have now shipped over 30 orders with parts and sold boards for almost 50 000 USD! But all money is invested in buying more parts so in future we can build them faster!

And we will not be like so many other eskate company with delays on promised shipment date that takes month or years to ship. All first batch preorders will ship out within 2 weeks!

Here is some pictures from the first boards almost assembly :  
![IMG_20190413_180255|375x500](upload://7Ehsg7aK1DfuKAz9TFNPOQSQQR9.jpeg) ![IMG_20190413_180105|375x500](upload://u1MYgSeMb0B4zEKspWuHPk12NIN.jpeg) ![IMG_20190413_143356|666x500](upload://7ITlQAjYAMMRzxZAgHZzfgTWVci.jpeg) ![IMG_20190413_140624|375x500](upload://rkgDDzKyZnsuEkW0iq6fltg7dfw.jpeg) ![IMG_20190413_180243|666x500](upload://pA2SR0m5bQkiPlirgi2hh7WAr6U.jpeg)

Since we install all component on the boards but still want it to be easy to remove the enclosure but water resistant we 3dprint like this for @Eboosted evo enclosure and fill it with silicone :  
So its easy to remove and install the enclosure without needing to disconnect the cables:

Hi, yes Its possible. You just need to change the receiver and some settings on the motorcontroller.

The deck comes like that, it gives you the option to install the truck closer or longer away from you. But its not a option to do it on a electric skateboard because you need space for enclosure.
The reason you dont se them on the standard evo is because on the standard gripetape is over the holes.

I think he means the lines which looks like split wood from drilling. Not the second hole pattern.

But why on this deck no second hole pattern?

I see, thank you. About bushings, what do you recommend when I'm exactly 80Kg (driving weight, not changed for years) - 90A or 93A?
```

---
## \#105 Posted by: mackann Posted at: 2019-05-03T18:37:52.350Z Reads: 182

```
If you like a little softer feeling from the trucks 90A if you like a little harder feeling from the trucks 93A.

Harder = more stability in high speeds, less turn ability 

Softer = less stability in high speeds, more turn ability 

But however 90A with our bushing setup still feel very stable on high speeds, in the video last posted here with X4 AT going 80km/h it have 90A and 80kg rider

I got them now, but got many orders for boards that use 220KV latest week so im already out of stock and dont have any for sale sorry. Did miss calculate how many i needed, ordered alot more 150KV because i sold more AT boards before but now for some reason all orders street versions that use 220KV..

So it will probably take 6-8 weeks more before i get new again.. So if you cant wait i recommend to look for another store that sells motor. Sorry but have to priority orders for complete boards.

I used the X plate voltmeter from 3D Servisas, so the original part of the voltmeter was covered.

![image|374x500](upload://xKCg1D3QzVtlpfzWAN3bk1kwJkW.jpeg) 
The discharge bypass 21700, 12 s6p makes contact between the power button and the battery.
So I moved the position of the power button.

Try riding and it's really fast!
This is the fastest of the boards I have ever had!
Even better is the brakes.
It slows down well and stops downhill.
If even the speed of Raptor2 is unsatisfactory, this is a board for you.
People who are not satisfied with this performance are probably not in the world.
If you adjust with Unity, there is a tolerance that even beginners can ride.
I think it is important to adjust the throttle curve because there is a lot of torque.
Run up the hill as if I were on a flat ground.
I do not feel the gravity peculiar to the uphill.
If you want a fast board but it's awkward to assemble, this is the one with the best solution.

I rided to Thorium X 4 several times.
At first it was difficult to turn the gear drive by hand, but now it's becoming smooth.
The combination of gear drive and 4WD is very responsive.
Slow Rumping Time settings are easier to use.
It is difficult for me to run at 70 kph.My ability is lacking.But it is a board that is easy to ride.X4 is a friendly beast.
The X4 will be my main board for a while.
