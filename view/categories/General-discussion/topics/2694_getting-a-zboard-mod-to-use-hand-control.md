Buying a zboard of craigslist for $150, it's the original classic with SLA batteries, so I'm gonna have to replace those with some lipo/li-ion.

I'm debating if I want to mod it to use a hand control instead of the foot pads. Have any of you had experience with both, pros/cons of each control method?

Any other mods that you guys know of that people have done on these?

Im not sure about changing the that stuff on the board... how hard would that be?  You thinking about changing the motor controllers? 

Ive heard the original Zboard referred to as a Alibaba mashup board so i think everything will be easy to find information on.
