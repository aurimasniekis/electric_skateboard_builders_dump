Will AT wheels fit my setup, is there anything special I would have to do?
Currently have Torqueboards 218mm trucks and soon to be dual 6374.<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/3/8/38c5502ea2f39a90341515c4a462f0c3a359218c.JPG" width="375" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/4/e/4eaf0659302ed01ab31f12f7d924acffd78b6dfb.JPG" width="375" height="500">

It depends on what wheels you mean. depends on your axle length and diameter. Some wheels/hubs fit regular trucks and others only AT trucks

You could probably fit some nice @psychotiller six shooters on there with the oversized caliber clones.
