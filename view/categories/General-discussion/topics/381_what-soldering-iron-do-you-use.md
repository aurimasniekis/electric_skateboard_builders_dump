I have been through 3 cheap ones in the last 12 months....

So i decided to buy this on ebay. It was about 80 or 90 bucks.

It's called ESDSAFE 862D+

Looks pretty good. It has a hot air gun also...

congratulations on getting rid of the toys and getting a real iron.

its seriously a good idea. your soldering will improve now that you have a decent station.

you wouldn't use this to drill a hole
<img src='/uploads/db1493/original/1X/833fce4739a56be2e069ba5c7ef14673f9385f34.jpg'>

so why do people continue to try and solder with these?

@torqueboards sold me on a hakko- I was genuinely surprised at how much of a difference it made compared to the simple $30 one I had before.  

only downside is the $85ish dollar pricetag, but I guess you get what you pay with soldering stations!

plus those sick colors make it more manly, lol.

Its funny the hakko is actually quite a good quality iron. Even though it looks like a bit of a toy.
Not sure why they changed their design. They used to look a bit more solid.

Hakko = Beast... Best soldering iron ever at an affordable price.. Saves countless hours from a weenie soldering iron that can't get nothing hot. Adjustable temperature gauge is awesome. Similar to the iCharger IMO. High quality yet affordable.

Wait 5-10 minutes to heat up a 5.5mm connector (doesn't even work still) and/or 3-4 secs with a Hakko :smile:

A good soldering station makes a HUGE difference!  I got a decent one about 2 years ago and continue to pat myself on the back for getting the hot air included.  Great for heat shrink (what i've mostly used it for) and pre-heating pcb's.  Recently i've even used it to solder some surface mount SMD!  

Mine is very similar to this one:

[img]http://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NzA4WDk5Mw==/z/DaEAAOSwBahU5OZ7/$_57.JPG?set_id=880000500F[/img]
Mine's layout differs slightly, and has different solder iron holder.  For <70 now (i think i paid around 90).  My deciding factor was the seller was on my way home so i picked it up the day i bought it online!  Bonus.  Had to pay tax, but quick shipping!  hehehe

Well, considering the package (iron + hot air), it is also a very cheap one.
Not to say it is bad, but you get what you pay for. 
All the 852 (fro aoyue and other brands) are cheap chineese stations.

A real good hot air station is several 100+ $.
But then it depends how much you plan to use it ...

Some review here :

http://www.eevblog.com/forum/testgear/atten-at8586-does-any-one-know-this-and-can-share-he's-opinion/

As for myself, I have a Weller soldering station : similar to WD81 , the best tool I have bought (more than 10 years ago)
I also plan to buy a cheap hot air station (probably similar to the 852 without the solder iron).

I use this guy; the Aoyue 469. It's not great, and definitely not pro-grade, but at $30 USD it's a million times better than a standard non-adjustable cheapo. I use hakko tips with it, and I've been really pleased with the results. After getting this I starting to enjoy soldering!

its interesting that "852D+" looks SO much like my hakko unit that I love! 
I used to have a weller wsd 81 that eventually fell apart. i replaced it with a
I also have a weller DS 801 and an atmoscope 
oh and I have a small gas powered iron for mobile work in cars etc.

but my favorite of all is the Hakko 701-10 that thing is is the boss. the de soldering pump is unbelievably awesome! if you have ever had to remove components without it you will know how awesome it really is. Although with a AUD$1200 retail price, its a little too serious for the average hobbyist. 

im actually considering buying one of those $80 chinese hakko clones  for science.

The key is to have the right wattage irons for the job in hand.

I use a 50 Watt soldering station for all my smaller, and electronic soldering. You can set the temperature which is essential - to have a steady, reliable temperature. You can switch tips and solder tiny stuff to medium stuff with this.

Much like this one : http://www.maplin.co.uk/p/48w-mains-solder-station-n34fb

These stations also heat up a lot quicker than direct mains powered irons.

Then for bigger stuff like like power connectors, XT 60 , XT 90, 4mm bullets etc etc, I have an 80W Weller:

http://www.powertoolsdirect.com/weller-sp80n-soldering-iron-with-led-light-80-watt-240-volt?utm_source=google&kwd=&utm_medium=merchant_pla&gclid=Cj0KEQiAjMC2BRC34oGKqY27jtkBEiQAwSXzfsixopSCGtE1JLwLBrpvUyFOxRcwCe2tIPKWPgq4ckYaAijz8P8HAQ

You really NEED a high power iron to solder the bigger stuff properly but be careful, you can melt an XT 60 very quickly :-)

If you connect the two mating connectors before soldering you will have a hard time melting the plastic housing on xt connectors. Also the other connector will keep everything in alignment if the plastic becomes soft while soldering.

I'm on the secondary stage of my soldering journey now. Months ago in this thread i mentioned that i was using a $30 crap 25 watt soldering iron fro radio shack. 

I have since bumped up to this 70 watt XTRONIC unit i got from amazon when i finally got so sick of my old one that i rage purchased a hotter one while ordering something else i needed. 
http://www.amazon.com/X-TRONIC-3000-3010-XTS-VARIABLE-SOLDERING/dp/B00KS8XA2Y?ie=UTF8&psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00

my next step is a nice hot air station with iron and multiple tips when i get sick of this one, but this one so far has been really good to me and seems to melt just about every damn thing quickly. A hot air wand for the smaller heat shrink applications  would just make my day. Right now i'm using a dewalt heat gun which can be a little awkward because of its size for smaller things.

Useful thread !
I can't bear my solder iron anymore...

So I wondering buying a Hakko but there are a lot of models.
What's the best compromise between for soldering from electronics components to say, 10 AWG abd 5.5mm bullets ?
Is 70W enough ?

I was at the hardware store today and took real long look at a some high wattage irons designed specifically for stained glass.
Looks like they would make short work out of 10 gauge wire. But I'm going to try out my 75 watt first.

Everyone is bashing "cheap" irons but my trusty $25 RadioShack iron has helped me build drones, build lasers, repair TVs, solder to PCBs/Arduinos, and soon will help me build my electric longboard. If you know what you're doing and know how to properly take care of an iron, you can make it last a long time :slight_smile:

It depend on what your are doing with it, mine is on for 8hrs or more a days and 3 to 4 days a week, so I need something that is robust, like a Metcal PS-800 ( I don't even have change the tips since 3-4month and is still looking new).

I never tin my tip and leave my soldering iron on overnight sometimes and it turns into a charred pock marked mess but I then just grind off the charred outside on the concrete and it works fine. 

I found the magic is 60/40 lead solder and a fat wedge as hot as you can get it will do almost anything.  .  It's now not a wedge but a concave but it works fine.  cheap and thoughtless.

20$ weller with a leds that tell you its on

Yes, though you might melt a bit of the plastic housing if you take too long. Make sure to plug the XT90 in to the opposite plug to avoid the pens getting bent out of shape.

Such a huge difference.  It's hard to express how much better the Hakko is, especially for soldering large gauge wire.  If you're looking at picking up a soldering iron, skip the first two legs of the journey and go right for the Hakko :joy:

Spend an extra $30 and pick up these tips.  Pricy but it's definitely worth it.  The huge chisel is particularly amazing

I've used this thing for a long time.

https://duna.com.tr/userfiles/productlargeimages/product_7735.jpg

My problem is I don't have a proper place to solder, so a soldering station is completely out of the question.
I solder sitting down on the floor most of the time.

This one is nice for me because only the tip heats up, so it gets hot super fast, and cools off super fast.
So getting it out and putting it away quickly is no problem.

Butane would also probably work pretty well for me, but thats just not what I ended up getting.

I've had it like 6 years, IDK why it hasn't died yet.
I'm not used to soldering irons lasting more than a few months.

When it finally does die though I'm going to get a soldering station with a heat gun, and just find a way to make it work.

I did some research and i found this thing that is way better than the hakko and it is so much cheaper check it out. [TS100](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01MD12DYT/ref=ox_sc_act_title_1?smid=A2FGAWCX62OR7U&psc=1) it can be cheaper as well if you already have a power source for it 12-24v.

Whatever you use make sure you use plenty of decent flux and afat chisel tip. Tin the wire and connector separately first. If the wires are long it takes forever to get heat into the cables, so i use blowtorch butane iron. People claim its easy even with 40 watt irons, but ive never found it easy unless the cablrs are short.

Well if you don’t have it you can’t answer it.
But I asked if the TS100 is capable of soldering high gauge wires to xt90 connectors because you will need serious soldering irons for that task.

it will be fine if you need more power you can go up in voltage it will heat up quicker and also recover quicker. the ts100 can handle 12-24v, with a max temp of 400 c.

I've done an embarrassing amount of research on this.

**Level 1**: crap irons. This includes stuff like usb powered, 20w plug in irons, etc. They can work and work well, but they're pretty basic.

**Level 2**: Hakko 936 clones. These are actually pretty nice. Temperature controlled. Tips and heating element are separate. Hand piece is kind of bulky. I'd put most of the things like Aoyue and Yihua here.

https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/hakko-production-images/production/full/9/3/936-12.jpg

**Level 3**: Hakko 888. Same tech as Level 2, but a bit nicer.

http://qrznow.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/FX888D_bdentinc__88776.1357739841.1280.1280__69398_zoom.jpg

**Level 4**: Arduino cartridge based systems. These guys mostly tap into Level 5 system's tips but use generic electronics to drive them. Mostly using Hakko FX-951 style tips, and clones thereof. I would put TS100 here, but TS100 seems to use proprietary tips. These guys are a big step up from Level 3.

The BOSS spot welder's soldering iron function is in this category.

These can be game changers as many run off DC, so can be powered off lipos or whatever in the field. And they get you into the cartridge tips for crazy cheap.

https://www.aliexpress.com/item/110v-220V-digital-Soldering-Iron-Station-Temperature-Controller-T12-Handle/32345223517.html

**Level 5**: Temperature controlled cartridge based systems. This is the cream of the crop. The tip cartridges contain the heating element and the thermometer. The feedback loop is tight, power delivery is fast. The handpieces are slim. There are various technologies here, but the style is the same. I think the most famous is Metcal ($500?). They can be had used for somewhat reasonable money. Used Pace industrial units can usually be found cheap on ebay. The Weller with the fancy display, and the Hakko FX-951 ($300?) are in this category (believe it or not Hakko is not king at level 5). JBC ($$$$$!) seems to own the very top of this category. It's really hard to go back after using these guys. They're usually in the 50w range, but they can deliver the heat to the tip very rapidly and continuously. Usually ready to solder in about 10 seconds. If buying new, I think the cheapest are like $200? Used units can be had for under $100.

https://ssli.ebayimg.com/images/g/fKIAAOSwPzhZ~I6s/s-l1600.jpg

There are some category busters, like Weller's 100w pencil with temperature controlled tips, butane irons, soldering guns.

Personally, I think the used Pace and Metcal, and the TS100 seem like standouts.

damn, 5 tips at that price seems like a great deal. But there's a chance that the genuine Hakko T12 tips will greatly outlast/outperform.

At minimum get the biggest one with the most metal, to do big bullets and large gauge wire. Maybe one of KF/D52/CF4/C4.

I'd personally also get a small and tiny chisel tip. The small chisel gets 90% of the work. The bent tips seem popular with the Metcal folk.

I use a Weller wesd51.

Ruined one pencil a few months in, but I was hot swapping tips using pliers to do so. Think I overtightened, as the issue was that ID became too large and there was play in the tip. 

Haven't had issues since I stopped hotswapping. Bought a nice set of various tips on eBay.

Looking into buying a Chinese hot air station soon

A month ago, only took it. Took Lukey 852D + FAN. Lukey stations are represented by 4 models. Judging by the description do not differ almost anything. 852D + FAN and 852D + are made in a metal case, 702 and 898 in plastic. 852D + is the only one with a compressor in the case and air supply to a hair dryer with a hose, the rest with a turbine in a hair dryer, which is more convenient.
