Tried to use his chat function and sent some emails, but nothing. Has anyone order something in the past 3 days and it not been shipped to or just me ;) 

Better yet has anyone been able to see @torqueboards available in the live chat recently?

I was on the chat a few days ago with him, we talked for maybe 10min but then he stopped replying. Not sure if that's related to what's happening now or what haha

Hey guys.. It's been a while since I've had access to logging in.

Anyways, we were in the process of moving.

We should be done in the next day or so and will resume operations.

Any questions, send us an email. We've been checking email as of lately and past emails we'll be following up with.

I'm glad to have found this thread. I sent out a couple emails with no response and was worried the whole business went AWOL. Please let us know when you've resumed operations.

Strange, I've filling out a few contact forms out over the past week, but I haven't heard back. I'll try to send an email directly (maybe the form doesn't work as well as direct emails)

I just assumed he was eaten by zombies. Seemed to be the most reasonable explanation.
