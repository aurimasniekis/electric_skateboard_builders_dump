How do you install the Kaly hanger when you remove the stock infinity hanger?  I can't seem to get the hanger seated into mounting plate for the hanger.  
The stock hanger is 49mm wide ![20181023_144648|690x388](upload://w7TjVZbz2mf2OMVH4BKfWDFSTzg.jpeg) 

The Kaly hanger is almost 52mm wide.

I can't seem to get the hanger installed with the bushings installed.

theres hella different sized bushings on the trampa website. you might need a different size. i had the same issue and finally got one really close and then forced it and squished it and havn't touched it since and its working great. :smiley:
