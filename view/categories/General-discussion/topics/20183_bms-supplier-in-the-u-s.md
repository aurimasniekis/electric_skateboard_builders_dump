I can't find any anywhere in the U.S. Anyone know of any? Or anyone selling a 12s one?

Li-ion and preferably 60 amp, but I could make a smaller one work. @smurf

I'm not sure if it's appropriate here, but why open another thread. I am in Canada and am in search of a BMS 80amp for 8s life (A123) pack. Finding one in the US would be great. Or at least something without a 30-45 day wait.
