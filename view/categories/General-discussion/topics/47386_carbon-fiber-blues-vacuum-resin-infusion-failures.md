My latest obsession relevant to this forum, has been making trash out of carbon fiber and epoxy. True to my nature, I set out on this endeavor with zero experience in vacuum infusion, and rather than take baby steps, I dove right into the most technical and challenging method of composite fabrication. I've read tons of threads, and publications about the method, but I just cant seem to get it right. So I'm creating a topic specifically about my expensive failures. 

Vacuum resin infusion is fuc*ing HARD. Any number of things can screw everything up and waste time and materials. So why do I do this method vs hand-layup or regular vacuum bagging? Because I am a difficult person! 

I'm using West System 105, and the 207 hardner. I'm gonna go ahead and get the 209 extra slow hardner for science, maybe the extra pot life will allow better wet-out

So here are some of the most significant problems I've had thus far. 
1. Moving the epoxy fast enough to cover the part
2. Achieving a full wet-out of the fabric 
3. Finding all the leaks!!
4. Mixing enough epoxy 
5. Laying the bag effectively 
6. Flow mesh puncturing the bag üò†
7. Keeping shit where I put it 

The epoxy always seems too thick. I got decent results using denatured alcohol to thin it. I tried heating the epoxy as well, but then it gelled too fast and didn't travel throughout the part. 

Hahaha, this is so frustrating 
Pictures and setup coming soon, tips and tricks welcome!
Here's the best result I've gotten so far
Its 12k 200gsm 2x2 twill with spread tow yarn and two layers of 24k 815gsm beneath it

Brush the resin on first and slow hardener works better. That epoxy you are using wont give the best finish. Doesnt set clear bit a little opaque. Doesnt bother me, I use that one as well. Board doesnt stay clean long anyway.

i always use slow hardener, and also for infusion you need to use special infusion resin. its less viscous.

The West system has a very similar viscosity to that of the fiberglast system 2000 epoxy which is right around 1000 cps at 72f. While I was deciding on which epoxy to go with, I did a fair amount of compairing this property and they all seem to be pretty close to the same viscosity. @MasterCho uses West system as well, iirc. Perhaps he could weigh in here as wellüòâ

I am pretty sure I've read everything MC posted on infusion here but I probably missed a couple of things. My research seems to suggest that diluting the resin with acetone or denatured alcohol is effective, but im not sure which is the better choice...

If this is your first time, give a try few more time, you'll get it. :grinning:   A small project like this, it shouldn't take more than 40min to infuse the resin into the bag.   207 (working time 100-120 min) is more than enough.

From the pictures, It doesn't seem anything wrong but I suggest to do the vacuum test before the infusion.

You shouldn't see any air or bubbles left behind.

I hope it helps.

Id reccomend practising with fiberglass and not carbon, a lot cheaper

Also use just the amount of resin so it sticks do not splash it with a half of litre of it

How is the flow mesh is puncturing the bag? It shold be soft
Also put some paper toweld to soak up the extra resin
Also fuck the slow hardeners use the fastest one and put a shit ton of it
I remember the days when polyester resin was much  better, It would harden in 15minutes and it didnt crack on the abuse of speed boats

Definitely sticking to slow hardeners. I use a heat-pad on the mould to expedite the cure once infusion is complete. 

@MasterCho I always do the vacuum test before infusion, just as you said in your other threads!! I actually do everything based on your instructions. Don't worry, I am incapable of giving up on something that I have not figured out. I'm particularly interested in what you use to dilute the resin, if you so do. You live in Chicago, right? what do you do to mitigate the cold temperatures?

Why, using the slow ones will just give you a little bit more of flex
With the faster ones it will flex less, in which i do not see a problem :) If you put a shit ton of the catalyst it will harden like 1/5th while you are putting more layers on and it will move less so its easier, at least from me..

Once the epoxy is set, it is as permanent as plastics get! Hardener is only a catalyst, the resin is the "concrete" and, as long as it is allowed to cure it will achieve the same properties regardless

I never heard of diluting resin before. :thinking:  it might weaken the strength of it.. not sure.

I have been using "HIGH IMPACT/HIGH TEMP VACUUM INFUSION EPOXY 3:1 325¬∞ F" since I am making car parts in the engine bay, I have had a good result so far.

Check this out.

Yeah, It's really cold in Chicago.:persevere:  I set up a table in the basement. 

Next time, please upload a video of  how the resin flows so I can tell you better.

UPDATE: SUCCESS!!!

As it turns out, West System epoxy resin is fairly thick stuff, even at elevated temperatures. To be clear, it is not an ideal resin for infusion due to it's viscosity. Since I've already spent the money on the 105-a, I set out to make good use of the investment. I figured that using the 209 extra slow hardener would allow for a longer pot life at elevated temperature, which would both significantly reduce the viscosity, as well as cut the pot life too. While decreasing viscosity is great, decreasing pot life is bad for infusion, so the theory is to heat the mold with a heating blanket, and hope that the mix would saturate the fabric fully, and still flow long enough to wet out the whole piece. Turns out that was good thinking.

The WS 209 needs a warm climate to set. As it's only been mid-60's F here in San Diego lately, the heat blanket should also expedite a proper cure of the epoxy in addition to improving it's infusion capabilities! So here's what I did from start to finish:

 Made a mold out of plexiglass using a heat gun:
![20180308_092611|666x500](upload://9jsxluheoM4nDYOdJYAhjlVc6I7.jpg)
Waxed after taping the boarder.

Layup and bagging:
![20180308_124911|666x500](upload://kOqzCGwKXmd6Yn4TNmDzcG4QQ3v.jpg)
Vacuum leak test: passed!
![20180308_124918|666x500](upload://6zHS0fOtzwf3psZKKwmqbTHdRua.jpg)
Full wet out- SUCCESS 
![20180308_133928|666x500](upload://7OSTzSit8zhwhvAZBwk4HpwJu0b.jpg)
Mold nestled nice and cozy on top of heat pad, insulated with a bath towel 
![20180308_135217|666x500](upload://ob4kDvH6v49sMrr72X6p8xZ6scc.jpg)

Now it's just a matter of time to see the fruits of labor. I'll update once cured!! SO EXCITING

your vacuum is beyond the gauge!!    .. isn't there a lesser amount of vacuum that is ideal?  I thought it would suck too much resin or something.  can you show a pic of your catch pot please and what's next?  how about a much bigger contoured piece.  go big! I want to see how it goes. 


what's the lowest temperature water you can boil in your vacuum?

that shape you are making is so simple I have polycarbonate that's very thin I plan to make the same if not a bit shorter.   I like the shape.  there's a youtube video to bend the stuff sure I can figure it, but you've gone this extreme construction way with a simple shape.  wonder how strong it would be vs easy  polycarb.  with this shape you can make it as strong and stiff as possible it seems.  what is the point..stiff or strong?  because the polycarbonate wont break but it will bend and crush everything under.  assuming the worst.   just Velcro I like more.

I haven't done the boiler test,  but it's a fun idea! My vacuum gauge is miscalibrated, but it was $5.
That giant pipe is the catch pot! It's a 2 foot abs 4 inch pipe with an end cap and threaded plug. I tapped three holes in the cap for vacuum pump, gauge and resin lines. $60 to make it

Yay!!! Project partially completed. This composite piece is essentially a carriage/mounting bracket to hold my ridiculously huge batteries to my deck, replacing the Velcro straps and eliminating the vibration they permit. 
This particular piece is 3 layers of 24K 815gsm fabric woven in a 2x2 twill. It is a rather heavyweight fabric and is a pain to work with. Pound for pound, the most rigid thing I can imagine!! I'm super pleased with it. NOTE: I am going for simplicity here. The process of constructing a proper gelcoat/fiberglass mold like @MasterCho 's CF enclosure is not necessary for my desired product, so I'm skipping all that.

All I have to do is trim, drill and mount the piece. 

Now for some project analysis and preliminary conclusions:
1. Resin infusion is an expensive endeavor. There is a significant learning curve, and the materials are expensive. 
2. The results are unfathomably strong, if done right. There is no comparison between my results from hand layup vs infusion. Either visually or structurally. 
3. The whole project is a huge pain in the dick! Meticulous setup, materials handling, etc. Not for the faint of heart. 
4. Everything that can go wrong, WILL go wrong. 
5. Viscosity sucks!! Heat can mitigate that to an extent, but it decreas the pot life tremendously. I didn't achieve a successful infusion with full fabric saturation until I employed a heat blanket. I use the blanket to warm the resin and hardener to around 110f, and I heat the mold and layup to 150f before I even think about mixing the epoxy. Heat can also compromise the bagging film's resistance to puncturing from the infusion mesh. Super frustrating when that happens. 

6. Mold-release WAX is way better than pva for visual effects but requires several applications and polishing. Also you cant really tape to it, which is frustrating. 

7. I wasted a lot of materials getting to this point. Expect to do the same, it happens. Haste makes waste!! 
More to follow soon... Thanks for reading!

Next project will be a cf deck with a wood core following @MasterCho 's footsteps.

looks nice!  Hard work pays off.

Were you using 3 layers of 24K 815gsm fabric?? That's why it took a long time to be 
fully saturated. That's equivalent to 12 layers of the regular CF 200gsm.  I am sure it's very sturdy.

Yep! Lots of fiber. Infusion epoxy would have made the whole project SO much easier. I'm going with PRO-SET INF-114 for all future projects. Mixed viscosity is supposed to be less than 300cps at 72f vs 600-800 for the west system 105.

Update time!!

So, I am underway in the new chapter of my cf experiment. I'm attempting to make a cf deck with a wood core. I got these oak strips, gluing them together with a little dab of hot glue, spacing them with finishing nails:![20180330_004705|375x500](upload://ykEGITR9hNlV5dzZurBQB7X0Y7v.jpg)![20180330_013102|666x500](upload://9qed7kGLViHw2YwzCXwZ2XotV5B.jpg)

![20180330_165751|666x500](upload://dDdr8YIl1mHk4JccanOECvpRCeV.jpg)

Layup

Bagged up
![20180401_012201|666x500](upload://pWdbsZNorgiaZpfn9Fpwp8w0f4v.jpg)

Now it's time for leak testing. I'm not going to mix any epoxy until I know that bag seal is PERFECT. 

the layup consists of, from bottom to top: 
1 layer 12k 2x2 spread tow 192gsm
3 layers of +-45 biaxial 12k 150gsm
1 layer 12k 2x2 spread tow 192gsm
1 layer 373gsm 6inch unidirectional tape
Wood core
1 layer 373gsm 6inch unidirectional tape
3 layers of +-45 biaxial 12k 150gsm
1 layer 12k 2x2 spread tow 192gsm

Hoping for a successful result, as it's about  $170 in materials without the epoxy!!

I know right?!? But I have been around here at least long enough to know where my loyalties lie, be that as it may. 

 I do appreciate all the work you forerunners do, but it is fun to at least dabble with more than a erector set.  Over it though... I wamt to ride! (especially now that you are pumping out those sick ass one-piece enclosures).

Also, not the place, but I am thinking about ditching my Carvon XL preorder and waiting for you to get stock of those RKP mounts... will you be getting any more in brushed (please god)? Id love a brushed mount piece as well, if possible.  I just feel like this Red Ember 107 abec set up is just begging for the style you put into them (hardcore belt driven @barajabali 6374s and all).

I just cant picture this rig with the carvons. I can't quite put my finger on why.

No offense taken, I actually appreciate the perspective. In addition to what you just said, about the need to do it ourselves, the problem I encountered is that because nobody runs batteries as big as mine, nobody makes enclosures for them either. As I mentioned up top, this all started from a need for an ultra-strong bracket. Once I had the tools I needed to make that I figured, f*** it, I'm going to try to make a deck too

This thread is alive again! Very excited about my new project. This time, I'll be vacuum forming a mold out of Lexan. I call it "the cheater-method" of mold making. Tonight I will start building the vacuum table, and hope to have time to update later. 

Another thing I am doing differently this time around, is utilizing a "stabilized fabric". This is a manufacturer process that binds all the fibers together, so that the fabric will not fray. Pretty cool sounding. 

Can't wait to get going on this!!!üòÜüòé

Small update: **vacuum table!** (Does anyone else use pegboard for theirs??). ![20181128_003603|281x500](upload://eRVzaMcjLVkXF5ulvjWOZAg3dG9.jpeg) super easy to build. Only major hurtle in this project is that my garage shares power with several other people, so electrical heat is a no go (20a circuit). Enter (*carefully*) PROPANE.., and propane accessories. Safety check will be performed tomorrow, and probably fail. Cardboard box with foil glued on, as a heat box! Worst idea I've had? Doubtful, but still probably top 100. 

F*ck this is a fun project. Can't wait to start making some really expensive trash again (as illustrated in my op). If this kind of thing is what I need to feel complete, should I still be in the food industry?... 

All I'm sure of right now, is that the need for DIY *blank* is stronger than any other aspect of _us people_ and I just love the idea of "Garage-band-status vacuum-forming molds for carbon fiber infusion"! What else would I do for fun? 

...umm get a life? 

Can you call anything else "living"?!

Do I know what I'm doing? Kinda, but more accurately, no. But i know how to try stuff!üòé

More to follow soonish

Way cool, I‚Äôve a sheet of kydex waiting for when I have a workshop

What I‚Äôve seen on YouTube and I‚Äôve watched a lot of vacuum vids is a perforated metal sheet with a heater underneath and a hot gun on top

Keep it up diy dude üëç

Propane, in addition to fire, explosion, and suffocation dangers, propane combustion makes lots of water vapor. Watch out for rusting tools!

Thanks for the advice! This will be done outdoors. My gigantic work table has some great casters, so I can move the vacuum box to the heat box! Last night I tested the foil wrapped cardboard by placing a sample piece about a cm from the heater and monitored it for about ten minutes. Foil and cardboard were still cool to the touch!! Sorcery I'd say. 

As of now, this plan seems promising! I'm waiting on a 15k btu tank mounted heater from Mcmaster's, as my 3k btu version is clearly insufficient for a 24√ó36 sheet.

Update! Tested my heating system:
https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/no-words-just-pictures-delete-words-use-pm/2992/8281?u=patrocks
The heating element is a regular propane heater, 10-15K btu. I got a 1lb tank adapter, but will be using a 20lb tank for the next attempt. As mentioned earlier, the heat box is cardboard lined with aluminum foil. Spray adhesive to bond.
Got some very good information from the results:

1. Infrared heat does not change the temperature of the foil by any material amount. This means that the cardboard is okay as long as it's COMPLETELY covered. However...

2. The heat from the burning propane **does**. To protect the glue under the foil, there's an air-gap between the heater and the box. 

3. Once satisfied with fire-resistantance of the box, I placed the frame over the box with low heat. This setting is insufficient. Takes too long to melt the sheet, and the slow buildup of heat deteriorates the foil-glue, which in turn deteriorates the infrared dissipation and fail!
Gotta go in hot and fast.

4. DUHH!! Clear plastic doesn't absorb infrared sufficiently to melt at the required rate!! Of course, I had considered this a probability. Experiment confirmed that hypothesis. Perhaps a fine mist of high temp black spray paint will work, or maybe I can source a sheet of black PETG, or something equivalently cheap...

Again, this is an ambitious project. But I'm having so much fun that it's totally worth it! Test 2 should take place tomorrow night!

Cheers for SCIENCE

Lol the deck was unsuccessful, but salvageable. Epoxy made it to the 2nd to last layer but not full wet-out. If i decide to finish it, it'll be the most rigid skate deck in human history, lol.

Thanks, I forgot to post about the fail

What are your opinions on the pre saturated sheets that have the paper you peel off an lay like tape?

prepreg?  I think it always takes heat to cure.  If you find any that take even a low temp to cure please post them.   be much easier with them having the right mix of resin to fiber.  be so much easier to make stuff.  less waste.  less mess.   they seem expensive by their price tag but considering how things typically go maybe be cheaper

So you just vacuum wrap and let it sit at room temperature for hours/days once you have the layers and expoxy set up?

No, prepreg goes in an oven. As @Hummie said ‚òùÔ∏èPrepreg has the closest to perfect ratio of resin to fabric that can be achieved. Vacuum infusion is the second closest. 

As far as costs of manufacturing, I'm curious as well. Probably a little expensive to make an oven precise enough and large enough for prepreg parts ü§î

But as I understand it, PP (lol) is the strongest final product, followed pretty closely by infusion. Interesting how a +/- variance in epoxy/cf ratio can affect structural properties so much... for our intents and purposes however, I wonder what the cost/ benefit comes out to. Probably easier to work with PP too..? (ü§£)

but looking at the finish on @Sender 's stuff you can get good results doing things the super simple layup way without even a vacuum (don't think he used a vacuum) but what he does has no crazy curves and he works with gravity.   probably is more resin than ideal for structural parts but still good.  

 Ive read a guide where a guy made a carbon bike frame where he wet it out, laid it on, and wrapped the whole thing in tape with tiny holes in it and it holds the carbon to the form and also squeezes out excess resin.   another way that's rarely done but it showed really good results.  It then needed to some smoothing and clearcoat for a nice finish but structurally would be better with no air gaps and less resin.

All this is true.

You can get cool stuff out of hand lay up but definitely a bit resin dense compared to vaccum bagging for a full structural part.

What I do definitely adds structural integrity no doubt, but is very focused on an aesthetic element as well.

Hand lay up also typically takes kore coats and more sanding and finishing.


If you take the proper steps and use the right stuff, you can do more conplex shapes with hand layup.


Hell, even @bigben doesn't even use a vacuum on his beautiful enclosures.

It is all about research and using the best materials for what you are trying to accomplish.

How many layers do you need for a full CF deck?

ben is using female molds I think and with that it seems much easier to get flawless looking results instead of the layup on top of a male form and then layers of clear to make it look nice.   the female mold seems failproof in a way to getting something nice.

For one thing, it depends on the weight and type of CF you are using.

Absolutely!!

And he uses gelcoat inside the mold and lays up chopped FG and polyester resin.

It is still a hand layup, but just look at how good his results are sans vaccum.  Of course he made a plug, then made the mold  which is quite a lot of work, easy to fuck up, and not cheap to do.

Just a lot of options to do a lot of different stuff.

Like skinning ABS enclosures makes them look way cooler and adds tons of stength.

To me, on $2000 and $3000 boards that people are building, spending a little more on things like nicer decks, enclosures, and remotes just seems like a no brainer.

[/quote]

The first board I built I disregard these things and bought cheap on all of these things, the only thing still standing is the deck. The enclousers broke which lead to the destruction of a vesc. My remote broke after about 100 miles mid ride, instant breaks, instant street meat. Spend the extra 200 bucks and have something that last. Also CARBON FIBER FOR THE WINNN
