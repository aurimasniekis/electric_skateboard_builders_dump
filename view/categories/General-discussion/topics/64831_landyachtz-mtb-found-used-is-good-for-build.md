This came across this on a local market place for sale.
Couldn't find any info on the site.
Anybody recognize it or the trucks?

Looks like Scrub trucks. I‚Äôve had a couple of sets in hand in the past.  I believe the hanger is the same as trampas and the profile is the same so would work with mounts designed for trampas. Maybe someone can correct me if I‚Äôm wrong üëçüèª

I think you are right.  I've got a set of scrub trucks, never run them, but they fit trampa mounts.

@Skunk I want that deck if you dont.

Or better yet see if they're interested in trading I've got a bunch of extra consoles around

Well @mmaner wants the deck and you (@Mobutusan) want the rest. Guy wants $90.
What do you guys think is a fair split? 
+shipping of course 
I'm not looking to make anything outta this. So no esta $$ for me to deal with picking it up and boxing parts.
Whatever you guys think is fair way to split the $90 plus shipping.

It's not a big deal. Especially with how much I've learned from all of you guys.
Anyway I can contribute back is worth it. 
There's a crazy amount of quality brand name used boards around me.
If I had more time I would be buying and posting them weekly.

I've skated LY since The Beginning, collected too many to admit, I'm presently building the last NOS Urban Assault we know of on the planet and I've not ever seen that deck before.

If that lower logo is silkscreened, my best guess is that's a Kokanee beer X Landyachtz collab for a Kokanee event. 

That's Kokanee Beer's logo on the top, and the bindings.

If the lower logo is silkscreened I'll buy the complete from you, if you ever decide to sell it.

Me either, hence my interest :).  The end angle looks interesting too, a bit shallower than most MTB's I think.

(edit: it's real) :) 

Pure speculation on my part: it was made in 2013-2014, a promotional for a particular event (employee or maybe ski/skate comp), and if that's a real LY Canadian maple stick, I would think they made no more than ten co-branded boards with Kokanee Beer - and that one looks new.

Pretty rare air.  

I have a couple of early 2000s that shoot thick like that on camera, and you'd think they'd be heavy, but they're not.  Elfin magic from Keebler's tree, who knows :) great find.

The madrid deck with the spring trucks looks interesting.  If @Mobutusan doesn't want the trucks Ill take the whole thing and just resale the trucks and wheels.  I really want that deck :slight_smile:.

That sounds good to me. I'm always on the look out for non-Trampa eATB gear, since, well, you know. Principles and shit. Lol

Since you have a pair of Scrub trucks, what do you think about them? 

@skunk Thanks for taking this on and let me know what I owe you. I really appreciate you taking the time to do this.

I've never ridden the scrub trucks, I just bought a set.  On the ground they feel just like trampa trucks to me.  I didn't like the look of the wheels so I never did anything.  I'm actually thinking about milling the axles from 12mm to 10mm and putting either 6 shooters or 107 thane on them and mounting them to this deck :slight_smile:.

Good to know. Yeah the tri spoke wheels are not the prettiest, but I've got ideas for them. One thing I've found from other shallow tip/tail (~20¬∞) mountain boards is that they turn like a semi truck with channel trucks. They seem best suited to skate style trucks. There's a reason why Trampa & MBS use 30-35¬∞ angles with channel trucks. I'm building up a monster board on a 20¬∞ deck and trying to figure out the best way to make oversized 10-15¬∞ wedges to make it work.

@Mobutusan @mmaner I'll collect from you guys after I have the board my hands, just in case something goes wrong with the transaction or he doesn't actually come through.  
I'm planning on meeting up with him around 2 p.m. tomorrow. I'll try to get the board broken down and weighed so I can get shipping quotes ASAP
