I am looking for the vesc 2.18 firmware and this is the only link I can find: http://vesc.net.au/ which looks like it's currently down. Is there anywhere else I can find it?

Do you already have BLDC tool? If so it should come with a folder with the default firmware.

I have the mac version. If there is one I can't find it. It doesn't come up when I click choose on the firmware tab

It should be in your documents folder I believe. Search your hard drive for "firmwares"

The firmware in the pic is for the old bldc tool.
If you downloaded the new Vesc tool, it should be packaged with firmware files.
