Seen a YouTube vid think your right it’s annoying tho as I’d love get my hand on a servant bag think an upscale in production wouldn’t go a miss especially while there’s the gap in the market he should be making full use of it...won’t last forever

Its a special bag he give to "influencers".  They are bigger.  Probably could fit a ton of stuff in there, like a tsg pass.

It seems they're specifically Christian esk8 bags it appears? Either way they look nice and about the only bag that I've seen that could possibly carry a 20+lb esk8 around and stay in one piece

Do you think that the thickness of a board is a problem ? I’ve got a 30mm enclosure on a 15 or so mm thick deck.

Best thing to do is post a pic of your board and tag him on IG.  Ask there - he'll let you know.

Told me my board was too big.  :frowning:

Yeah i got a response from the guy and had a chance to buy one but they didn't have the blue/silver/red yet...also tbh the religious tie in is a little outputting to me but the name OBED is obscure enough that I don't care enough not to support a small entrepreneur's business if he's putting out the bag quality that everyone raves about. I'm going to hit him up about the silver one and see when its available

Lol yea I can see that people either love it or hate it.

Alternatives are the evolve bag or the boosted I suppose? 

Boosted looks sorta strange to me and the evolve is... well evolve

Just saw this, not sure, That's about what more than 1 & half an inch? I don't think the thickness of the deck is as much as an issue of how wide it is. Thickness + Wideness makes it difficult. A Meepo Fits Fine though

Just want to  say these bags are definitely worth the wait. Large boards can fit them, but you will have to get additional Velcro straps to attach to the already existing backpack straps.

The Obed is pretty scarce so I ended up getting one of these: https://www.amazon.com/Hubro-Designs-Boosted-Longboard-Backpack/dp/B07HB89Y7P/ref=asc_df_B07HB89Y7P/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=312154671095&hvpos=1o1&hvnetw=g&hvrand=8076563933262866173&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9031600&hvtargid=pla-568773266766&psc=1 
Works really well with a board that is 10'' wide or less..

Thanks for the recommendation! Would you be able to measure the height of the skateboard pocket? I’m wondering if a 31” Tayto will fit. I saw in the reviews that the Boosted Mini dosnt fit.

Oh yea if the tatyo is as wide as the spud then it's not ganna fit , at least not without modification

[quote="Jc06505n, post:72, topic:67040"]
Did a small test of whether or not the Build would fit in an Obed Bag, particularly the Giver , the biggest they offer I believe. The verdict? No:

You need to get an extended velcro strap, it’ll fit and its strong enough to carry my 12s4p Spud.
