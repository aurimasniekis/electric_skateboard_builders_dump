Like many of you, I’m always looking for ways simplify things. Living in Southern California, I have very limited space and so I’ve been thinking for some time on ways to maximize my garage space for charging and working on my boards. 

The idea I came up with is in no way original, but I am surprised by how effective it is for organizing, maintaining, and charging my boards.

The bench I made is 42 inches tall, 48 inches long and 24 inches deep. 
It’s made of 2x4 for the vertical legs and for boxing in both ends. I then used 3/4 inch high quality plywood for the work bench top and the base of the bench. 

I then mounted Rubermade Fast track garage organizer to each side. https://www.homedepot.com/p/Rubbermaid-FastTrack-Garage-Multi-Purpose-Kit-15-Piece-1928870/205644982?cm_mmc=Shopping%7CG%7CVF%7CD59%7CMulti%7CNA%7CPLA%7CClean_Sweep%7C71700000033435183%7C58700003894708233%7C92700032355438931&gclid=Cj0KCQjw5fDWBRDaARIsAA5uWTjBvG8ZwATM1NHSEiodh9ZhTThlMDSNbVJyoU5iS_CxkEU8ypPsbtUaAvxSEALw_wcB&dclid=COaK-qexz9oCFVKEYgodH1IICQ
The dual hook piece (shown in link) is the perfect length and width for securely holding a skateboard with plenty of room for wheels up to 100mm. The hook is also rubber coated which provides grip to keep the board from sliding around. 

The bench is deep enough to fit two boards side by side easily. 

I mounted a shelf about 12 inches below the top of the work bench to hold my chargers. I then mounted this at the back of the shelf to plug the chargers into. https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B071DPFG7V/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o04_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1
The rotating outlets provide easy access for all my chargers.

I then covered the bench top and shelf with this. https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00XZHRL7U/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s02?ie=UTF8&psc=1

After a few days I added a backsplash of 1/2 high quality plywood. The backsplash mounts from shelf to extend about 8 inches above the workbench top. To the backsplash I mounted an led light. https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01FDD79AW/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 
I also added another power strip with clamps and usb plugs for charging remotes. https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B073BZSGPK/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1
I finished up with adhesive Velcro for my remotes and garage door opener.

I’ve been using this bench for about two weeks now and I absolutely love the convenience for centralized charging and maintenance. It takes up very little space, but makes board storage, charging, maintenance much easier. No more stacking boards up on the ground or leaning them against the wall. 

As much as I’m enjoying the bench, I’m certain there are other ideas or add-ons I haven’t thought of...what are you guys/gals using? What else should I add to my bench...how else can I improve it?
