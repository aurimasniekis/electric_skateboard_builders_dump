I am always surprised how many eboarders ride without a helmet or just a half shell. In the DH community you will be left at the bottom of the hill if you show up without a lid.

You go down fast when you start hitting 20+mph. Too fast to respond in most cases. Invest in a nice lightweight full face helmet and save your face.

I don't have an electric longboard yet. I was just wondering, does it break to maintain a stable speed when going downhill, or do you have to foot break or accelerate backwards or something?

@disastorm you have a few options when going downhill on an electric longboard: 

 1. allow the the speed to build up until you reach the board's terminal velocity which will be much, much slower than a regular board due to all the friction and resistance from the belts and motors. There is a lot less resistance on a single drive, but its still plenty. On a dual drive there's ample resistance. Enjoy your speed. Hell, hit the accelerator. Why not? Feed the Need for Speed. 

 2. USE THE BRAKES. Almost all ESCs used on eboards have them, in fact you'll be hard pressed to find one the community generally approves of that doesn't have brakes. I can't think of any as we all use Car ESCs or a VESC which not only has brakes but regenerative ones. Once the brakes slow you down you can just step off, stomp the tail and flip the board up like Marty McFly. 

 3. Slide like a boss. Strap a beer can on your helmet and lay down so the sparks fly. 

 4. Use a large, immovable object to abruptly reduce your forward velocity, such as a tree or a large rock. I don't consider this a good option. It usually doesn't end well.

Preach it @chaka ! I hate seeing my friends injured! Do you have a few recommendations?  I tried (meaning I ordered, tested, and returned) a [Triple 8 Invader][1]. I couldn't hear much through the helmet; and I feel like audible awareness when in trafficked areas is pretty essential. On plus side it looks badass and was only $130.

I also felt like the full face was a little bit of overkill given my typical 10-12 MPH sidewalk cruising speed, but if I get more daring a full-face is a good idea I think!

For now I'm a hero in a half shell like @longhairedboy.

On the topic of e-board safety I wear these gloves when I ride, they have 3 exposed fingers so you can still use a remote confidently and they have saved me a fair bit of hand skin testing out my board in the past few weeks. I like to adapt these to sliding gloves or vice versa once I get more confident with my sliding on 90mm 75a wheels (pretty tricky!)

@longhairedboy @kai word. At one point I had a similar helmet; the Giro Switchblade. It was a full-faced mountain biking helmet and I liked it; it only weighs a little more than a regular half-shell, but has the added protection. Worth noting: these are polystyrene helmets and they're really only good for one major fall. The point is that the material cracks when you fall and absorbs the impact (instead of your head or face). This is different than typical multi-impact skating helmets. When I go full-face, this is what I'll get. If you fall a lot, it might get expensive (but, I mean, it *is* your skull after all).

@longhairedboy i agree it looks nice , just not practical for florida heat. Just my opinion before u take the $200 plung. A lot of those downhill helms dont look vented .... its hard to find ones that are. I would be sweating in my shoei helmet riding my cbr and that thing is vented. You can open and close the vents on motorcycle helms which is cool though. 
On a side not i wonder if these chin bars work. If so, a skate version would be cool http://www.pocsports.com/en/product/1648/sinuse-sl

The Vector M-5 is light at 2.5 pounds but I found it too small for my head. My chin protrudes like 2 inches below the chin bar.

The Vector M-6 is 3.2 pounds which is right up there with some motorcycle helmet weight.

Some of these "modular" style motorcycle helmets with either flip down face bars or removable face bars are intriguing because they could allow more ventilation and comfort during slow speed  and high temperation operation and full protection certified when the chin bar is in place.

This one for example is 3.5 pounds weight. http://www.ebay.com/itm/Dual-Visor-Modular-Flip-Up-Matte-Black-White-Motorcycle-Snowmobile-Helmet-DOT-/271436874310?var=&hash=item3f32e60246:m:mQ5dSaubSa9u8APWQ1q2p0g&vxp=mtr

The flip up ones are kind of dorky looking though.

Have a biking buddy who just got one of these. Super safe but single use not sure its viable for 3-400 dollars a pop (literally) investment. Fast movement maybe even a run off would probably be enough to set this off. They are sensitive enough that they have to adjust the sensors in them for bike tire size ex: foldable bikes vs 700c road bike.

Truely studies about bike helmets make them seem pretty trivial for falls over 20mph.  For the higher speeds we are seeing "over engineering everything" is probably most important for our safety gear. 'Vest in a good helmet folks.

I got the Vector M-6 and it's pretty good choice. Nice wide opening for better vision.

Not too heavy at 3.2#'s and it nicely dampens the wind and mechanical noises which for me anyway makes it easier to go fast with less stress.

Beware the M-5 unless you have a smaller head.

It does have one effect though. People instantly realise I am on E board. 

When I was just wearing bicycling helmet I think a lot of people thought it was push board.

The MET Parachute is even less and good ventilation, 700g.
But it is double the price from the first two.<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/6/6c538e31eed63bc57db32b935e6c5cfd31c73440.png" width="500" height="500">

also i found this
BELL Super 2R where the chin protection removable(what i like very much) and it also weighs arround 700g
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekzrJyqJEns

and the lightest i could find:
ALPINA  King Carapax with just 400g(hope they do not lie)

What do you think about this? Is it enough or are they just to weak?
The full face skate helmets are to much of a motorcycle for me. And i think the weight of the bike options is a good selling point.

btw, 1000gramm is 2,20462 pound

Am I right that you have the TSG PASS Helmet?

After some dangerous situations I start to think that my half shell isn't longer appropriate for the job.
Even if I'm not the most beautiful guy I think face and teeth protection can save you a lot of money in the long term.

Picture is from the inside. I know it says nothing, but you don't notice that you wear a helmet.
This one is so light and the visor is huge. Like a panorama window. The view isn't limited in any direction.
Really an amazing product. Only downside is that people check you out even more and you look like a jerk when going slow 😄
So full throttle...
