Pretty easy, just post a pic of your build and list some of specs about your Mountainboard build! (Definitely not using this as inspiration :roll_eyes: )

It’s hard to post a picture and specs as all my builds are in constant development. Either I‘m not happy with something or want to try new stuff out, but let’s try it with my quad:

Or just have a look on AliExpress. There multiple 10“ options. You will probably need a hanger extension than.

But super heavy as well. With LiIon you would get a way better range with the same weight and probably even for cheaper. That’s why i‘m in process of building a LiIon pack now. The 5Ah lipos I use as I need them on my light build. Not all of us have the money you can spend on your builds 😉 that’s why modularity is a key factor on my builds. Maximum interchangeable parts on all builds to hold cost and down time at a minimum.

Oh and i was curious if my range is too low compared to the battery size, but well looks like not really. If to calculate the max range and average Wh/km usage.

You: 22Ah x 3,7V x 12 = 977Wh 40km range, means 24,4 Wh/km

Me: 10Ah x 3,7 x 12 = 444Wh 18km range, means 24,68 Wh/km

Honestly I would have expected a bit better range from the gear drive as the free roll should be better, but looks like not really. Very interesting.

My eMTB started as a prebuilt from Trampa.

The current setup is as follows:

* trampa holy pro electric deck 16ply
* trampa infinity trucks
* @nowind etoxx mini direct drive (8:40 helical gears)
* 2x VESC6
* 2x HK SK8 6374 149kV
* Trampa ratchet bindings and heelstraps
* Trampa Superstar 8“ wheels with Trampa tires
* 12S7P 30Q battery with Bestech D140 BMS
* Monster Box
* approximately range 40km
* weight 17.5kg with battery

![20190504_170730|666x500](upload://s2xaav5nnLQ0pzGJJ72kdOHX53W.jpeg) 

![Screenshot_20190324-173626_VLC|690x335](upload://f0oX9PTOenyTQyeNgSEEoGIfI68.jpeg) 

I also have a few pairs of 6S 5Ah Lipos I can use if I want to shed some weight for jumping in exchange for range but have not done that so far.

Yeah sure

- 2x 6s 8000mAh sls Lipos. (Will change to lion 12s6p next week) 

- Dual 6374 okp motors 15mm belt htd5

- 2x focbox with selfmade "cooling system" in the box

- Mount for the box is selfmade and works 
surprisingly well

- Bag and Box are from amazon dont have a link anymore its called SurvivalBox orso

I builded everything so it should be waterproof even in hard rain or snow but I dont do that often. 

Feel free to ask if you want to know more, I even have pictures from the build. Happy for the direct drive and new battery pack on the way. 🤘🤘

I don't know F1 bindings but F5 are like clouds :sunglasses:

BTW it hurts seeing your pic without knee pads on the track :laughing:

When I was a kid I crashed with my BMX on gravel and you could see my knee cap :open_mouth:, needed a surgery. It was a miracle, my whole body was fucked up including stones inside hand and arm but my head was without injuries. Jesus I didn't wear a helmet but I've learned the lesson.

They were nice, need to figure out why they broke and modificate the next pair. All my parts are reliable except motors in general. I'm still searching for motors that last longer than a few weeks/months.

Trampa EMTB, used to have 2017 belt pro motor mount; switched to Overion chains (love them). The pictures are with the Trampa 154kv motors, I have 130kv 6374 10mm shaft Maytech base, have to fix one, will put them back soon. 4 x 6S 6000mAh 60C HRB's. Mini remote. Tons of torque and reliable fun! ![MTB|666x500](upload://akUizt81ZxWx1fOa4j2VOBVGmEj.jpeg) ![MTB2|666x500](upload://24rzW67YeAqlURO7cVsW3dJIhOi.jpeg)

I'm not sure I entirely count as I don't have a pure eMTB currently. Bindings are hard for me post-knee surgery. I used them most a decade ago in Kiteboarding & MTB but today they feel iffy. 

But hell why not. Here are my two current carvers. 

* LaCroix Prototipo deck
* TRAMPA Ultimate Channel trucks
* 8" knobbies on Superstars
* E-TOXX 5:1 straight geardrive (previously Kaly 4:1)
* 2x 170kv 6380 Torqueboard motors
* 2x FSESC6.6
* 10S6P Samsung 30q pack

![IMG_20190408_113240|666x500](upload://vCWtWnN31xmMBrkS4iMBvipjUrB.jpeg) 


My most recent build is essentially a Kaly XL 2.0 Carver.

* Kaly XL Deck - Hard stiffness
* Kaly Channel Trucks
* 8" street Pneumatics on Superstars
* Kaly Helical 4:1 Geardrive
* 2x Kaly 190kv 6374s 
* Unity FOCBOX
* 12S4P Samsung 30q pack

I'm about 1000 miles into my Kaly build and I can say that I absolutely love the deck. And the Helical Geardrive. Unf.

I can't bring myself to grip the deck even. With the lips on it I feel super grippy already, been enjoying riding it bare. 

I've got a second deck on order just because I love this one so much, going to work out a larger modular, printed enclosure for a 12S8P.

I need to install a small temp sensor I have at home as well, just need batteries for it. If I touch the packs directly after a hard ride I would say 35-40 degree minimum. As i use only 5Ah packs in 1P there is a lot of stress on them, so it’s to be expected that hight temperature. Nice to have a comparison to other packs. Thx for sharing your info!

I did it because I watched a YouTube video about why Tesla packs were king of the roost. They stressed pack temps. 

I swore my buddy (I’m basically his mechanic) was going to wreck his set of lipos unless I turned down the amps. I was guessing close to 100f. I guess I’m a bad judge of temp. Hands were always wind chilled when I pulled his lipos out after a ride to check.

[quote="DEEIF, post:28, topic:93255, full:true"]
Do you think you need sensors for a mtb?
[/quote]

100% IMO at least with vesc based esc's but tbh I didn't try sensorless FOC. It was so frustrating with my cogging motors when I finished the MTB build, sensors doesn't really work in BLDC mode and you get stuck everywhere. Here you can see the dramatic difference between hybrid or sensored BLDC and sensored FOC mode with sensored motors.

5Ah lipos are nowhere near stressed on a MTB.
My RC heli gets 5-6min flight time out of a set of such lipos. Average current draw is 35-40A with maximum 120A and I am not a hardcore pilot or run a really powerful build.

Believe me when I tell you that they are not breaking a sweat.

If you can take them out you of the heli, you are good. :rofl:

We are not measuring battery temps really. As long as they are not puffed we call it good. Don't forget that they are also cooled by the rotor draft and that we treat them more as a consumable than you would treat an esk8 battery.

(And I'm hardly trying to define 3 builds for the future : a cruiser (the shorter of my deck, urethane wheels, Mad Fury DD...), an AT carver (the "racer", 12s, dual ESCape, Berg., hammock base plate, custom GD ...), an eMTB (the new Darth Vapor)... and the Dirt scoot, the eMTBike soon etc ...    
 really hard when you get like 6 or 7 builds of parts laying around for more than 3 years ...)

I love so much the deck, the flex, the width ... stance a bit too short and only 20° tips angle.
But 12s lipo + big chain + vesc 6 in FOC + 130kV was super good for two years.
Now I'm trying Heli gears, and I was dam impress by the "Direct" transfer of the drive !!!
Impressive !!

At the WheelsGames 2018, one was in hooks, and you can really turn and raise the front easily (a pro mountainboard rider also try, and it don't work. 90° and 180° turn was not easy, the rider have to get off the board to turn it the right way ...) :

* MBS Comp 95 / F5 bindings / Matrix II / Rockstar II
  Dewedged rear - 5°, yellow-front /orange-rear blocks
* Dual FOCBOX @ 10s & dual ESCapes @ 12s (soon)
  Plan is to mount both, then swap phase wires and
  swap battery from 10s to 12s whenever I want. 
* 10s2p 16Ah Zippy Lipo (4x 5s 8Ah) 592Wh
  (soon) 12s1p 6Ah Graphene or 12s1p 8Ah Nano-tech
* E-Toxx 5:1 Helical mini gear drive w/extended axles
  @idea V.2 motor mount used as front bumper for now
* Build Kit Boards 6374 190kv motors
* Mini remote w/ dual receivers

Goal is to be able to run 10s or 12s and utilize my collection of Lipos if I want to go for extra range, speed or both. Front motor mount cage will stay in case I decide to try 4wd with belts up front for a hybrid belt/gear drive system. For now, it makes a nice front bumper/light mount with some heavy duty foam I got from a small laptop box.

Also have 9" & 10" Harbor Freight tires and old MBS tri-spoke hubs that will be used on a monster 4wd/golf board at some point.

Then there is the lightweight, balanced jumping board I want to make with top & center mounted batteries and ESC's, dual diagonal drive, and either 8" MBS wheels or 6" @psychotiller Six Shooters on 9.5mm axle trucks.

As @venom121212  said it’s a replacement for your hall sensors. You place a magnet on your motor shaft and in a defined distance a magnetic sensor pcb is placed. The sensor than can very precisely detect the exact position of your motor. Boosted use a similar encoder on there boards. 

There is not much information about it in here, but you could have a look here

That's basically what I tell myself and others, and helps me justify putting all my safety gear on for each ride. I remind myself that these vehicles are hand built DIY experimental beasts and I'm essentially a test pilot on every ride, so I'd better be ready for something to go wrong and be able to crash land safely. And since I'm constantly changing, tweaking, fixing something almost everytime, almost every ride is a test ride of a new configuration, and I am in fact, a test pilot.

Pretty basic mounting. Had to drill 3 holes (I also drilled a 4 hole pattern for an older hub) and use longer bolts and an extra set of nuts to bolt the hub and pulley together. I used nuts in the hub to mount the two halves together first, then slide the pulley over the bolts and use the second set of nuts to hold the pulley on. The only important part is getting the pulley centered over the hub before drilling the holes. I can't remember exactly how I did this, but it involved using bearings, 12mm bolt/nut, and the center pulley hole to align everything, then drilling through the hub mounting holes into the pulley.

I have to say, one of my motor has a defective sensor. So I just have no sensor in dual6374 setup and for me there is a small difference. When you start from a standstill, you just have to accelerate with a little feeling and it works flawlessly. A bit like a clutch. I'm also a bit worried about sensors that cause VESC problems caused by dirt, water, and what not gets into the motors after time. But that may not be 100% true, but over time I got that feeling.

If you are able to be your "own" sensor, you can do without it, but with sensors it's also fun :D

@Andy87 also is working on something similar but that will still need time I assume :)

Well VESC6 is good too. I was reporting & beta testing the Unity; so I left it in my board. When something works, usually I don't change it until it fails. And I don't have that much money lately to get VESC6 anyway. For my style of riding, I just need something that pushes me at speed towards some jump packs !

Great thing is that you have multiple options !

I have both Unity and ESCapes (VESC 6.4). I can't really see any difference performance wise. IMO, Unity is a better option. Cheaper, built-in switch, push to start, anti-spark, compact, reliable. You can't go wrong with it. Only the built-in BT module sucks but you will now be able to replace it for the Metr module.

You can make a divider in the enclosure.

Mine is the Monster Box but you get an idea how you could do it. Obviously I also have foam in there to stop the pack from moving.

![20181122_195830|666x500](upload://33fl4HXvaLvxfXpvBcS8MoofyPl.jpeg) 

Another good idea, is if you are using a waterproof box to mount the vescs on the lid.

Just the inner spring holes. Best you can do. If you still have the old baseplate with only outer position holes you can just use some M6 threaded inserts. Easy thing, easy swap. If you want to have access to the screws later mount the escs facing to the top. Gives you more air flow anyway. It’s a win win 😉

you can either drill holes in the deck or just use the ones you already have. Of you have Infinitiv trucks than you have 4 threaded holes for the spring adjustment in the base plate. You could just use them. If you have the „old“ ultimate base plate than you should have only two threaded holes in your base plate (think they changed the design to 4 now as well) but your deck should non the less have 4 holes for the spring adjustment. Just use this holes. M6 threaded inserts where a bit too small for me, but nothing that epoxy couldn’t fix 😅 try maybe M8, could work better.

I see your problem now. i would than use some m4-5 threaded inserts inside the deck. there is enough space over for it and probably the best way to mount a case. optional you could design something like a spacer mount plate which would just be fixed with the 4 stock bolts. If you have access to a cnc that would give you even more options. 

I think the threaded inserts are the most easy way to mount them thou.

Or potentially I can use more dual lock on a plate like that as the bolts etc will not be in the way.

That pack is probably a little too small for off roading.  4P 30Q is 80A max continuous, divided by 2 (motors) thats 40A each but thats pushing the pack to the absolute limit.  Can you get that up to 6P at least? I assume you are running 12S cos of the 170kv motors which will mean its top speed will be good but you also want Amps, lots of amps!

No can do, I already have the battery and the cells are not new so I can't really make it bigger.  This was originally a campus board that has grown out of proportions

Good to know I can't expect it to be a real off-road board though, it was never meant to be.  I just like the eMTB deck style, bigger wheels help with brick, and the TKP trucks make it easier to maneuver around people

Me too, They are budget to the max and still delivers on function and look. 

Battery enclosure

https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005T5A28G/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1

esc rear mount enclosure 

https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00TJ49K4U/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1

Now you have to do a little work on both to get total waterproofing ie the lid on the battery box and the end caps of the esc enclosure ( 2 part needed ) but a total budget necessity at 40$

It's so close to fitting 20Ah 4s turnigy lipos.
Lipos are 203mm , the enclosure is 202.8
and who knows if the lipo measurement allows for room for cables.

Ill have to measure some more

Looks like @marcmt88 mounts, if I'm not mistaken.

@hyperIon1 Nice job. That looks very clean and professional. Can you tell me how much it weighs? Looks pretty light for what it is.

without the battery and motors its 16ib now a battery with 18650 cells will add 5lb and motors will add 3lb more. So finished weight would be 24lb, lipos will decrease this by 2-3lb
