Hi All,

I would like to share my progress with my electric skateboard so far. I am going all 3d printed on this one.

Short video I just made : https://www.instagram.com/p/BL1w4pKDUAG/

I can say at this point, Motor mount and gears are all 3d printed and proven to keep up after 40-50 km of use. It took a lot of experiments and designing to get it right. But they are pretty strong now. I even made the motor mount tilt adjustable! 

You can see motor mount side here :

This is 24th revision of the design. It took a lot of tries to get it to this stage.

Now I am focused on loopkey and remote controller.

Loop Key:
I made it using 2 x XT150 connectors. It has charging resistor with a pushbutton 
I made a sliding switch style enclosure for the loopkey. 
I plan to make a switch design that will automatically press against the resistor push button prior to actual connection.
Demo video here : https://www.instagram.com/p/BLzQCchgoOg/
Video first shows startup without resistor and later with it.

Remote Controller:
I made it with an Arduino Mini Pro & 2.4 ghz radio module. No failsafe yet, but I will add that too.
Pistol trigger is made of linear potentiometer and spring mechanism.
Spring is adjustable to set idle position at deadband area, pull to speed up, push to brake.

Let me know what you think!
Cheers,
Ahmet

that remote looks like a bomb! lol

other then that pretty cool i've been playing with printed mounts but the plates seem to weak. i've already snapped 4 alu motor plates....

what materials are you using? petg is pretty strong so far.

Hahaha I know :D I changed the design to a handheld pistol style now :D should be less scary :D

I am actually using PLA with %100 infill. I think very important part with 3d printed pieces is how you use screws. As you can see in first image, all screws are pushing layers onto each other. They are on same axis as the layers are stacked. So it is actually mostly the screws and nuts inside the plastic carrying the weight.

It has very little to no wobble at this point, and holds pretty strong. They broke only when skateboard ran away at full-speed and hit a wall, which is a good thing so it stops :D

I think its the exposed wires and toggle switches...pretty stand for bomb props lol

I have never printed 100% infill except for tiny tiny parts.
what size motor are you using? i;m pretty sure my 6374 12s could snap any pla on torque alone :sunglasses:

I like the belt cover tho, I was thinking integrating the edge like that into the motor plate would make it much stronger for lateral stresses. :nerd:

Mine is also 6374, 3.2kw 240kv from alienpowersystems.

But not 12s, mine is only 6s. Not planning to upgrade battery. Because Im happy with range and speed im getting while living in a small city, Malmo.
