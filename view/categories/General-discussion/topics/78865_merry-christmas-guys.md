Only Scandinavians and some Eastern Europeans do this. I don't think Germany, France or the UK do if some Europeans are confused look at this :laughing:

Merry Xmas folks. Enjoy your time with your family and every moment with friends. Often we rush as life is all about instantaneity and forget about that. A good friend of mine told me... love the people around you cause you never know what you have... until it's gone.

Cheers and have a merry x blast !

MERRY CHRISTMAS to the whole Esk8 Community, Thank your for sharing your knowledge and experience, without this community, issues we have with eboards wouldn't be solved. Thank You.
