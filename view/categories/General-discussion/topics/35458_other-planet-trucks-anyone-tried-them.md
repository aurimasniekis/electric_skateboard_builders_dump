For a long time i have followed "Longboard Technology" on YouTube. They have been developing an interesting new type of truck for longboards.

A standard skate truck has its Centre of Gravity lowest whilst turning, this means that without the rubber it tends to "fall" into a turn. At high speed this causes instability as can be seen in this video : [What Causes Speed Wobble?](https://youtu.be/53a2Vm5Y9-A?t=63)  (@ about 1min)

Their design allows for a a truck which has its CG lowest when in the centre position, This means that even without rubber it always tries to return to centre. They achieve this by using a profiled cam which the axle is moving on. Its easier to understand this by seeing it :[Breakdown of Other Planet Trucks](https://youtu.be/uOeWX49LCNM) .
It seems like a simple idea but it also makes a lot of sense.

In the early days they were making all of their prototypes by hand. These look mechanicaly simple and may be easy to DIY. There is a good explanation of an older prototype here : [Other Planet P1](https://youtu.be/PT4Q5N2vLq8?t=208) . 

Now their selling a finalised version of these trucks : [https://www.otherplanetskate.com/products/other-planet-revolution-rolling-cam-skateboard-truck](https://www.otherplanetskate.com/products/other-planet-revolution-rolling-cam-skateboard-truck)

A few benefits i could see of this type of design are:
 - stable at speed.
 - change cam profiles for different truck feelings.
 - easy to swap hanger if you wanted a few different motor setups (hangars are avalable separately)

So . . . . my questions to all of you are:
1. Has anyone ever seen or used them before?
2. Do you think any standard motor mounts could be used with them?
3. Has anyone ever tried to diy something similar?

I never used before, i thought about it tho until i find out about avenue trucks. 
For high speed, i think u can use with hub motor. but down side of other planet is , sliding a lot and large turning radius which they mentioned.

```
I think the large turning radius is due to the 17° attack angle of the base-plate. I guess some sloped risers would easily sort this out. also if you were going to diy some you could set this to whatever you wanted.

What do you mean by sliding?

I found another truck that uses a similar concept but a different mechanism :  [curfboard](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/curfboard/curfboard-the-ultimate-surfskate-truck-for-skatebo)

It looks similar to the steering i saw on a 2 wheeled board i saw on here.

I’ve got 2 sets of OP Trucks ... how I ended up owning them was a small adventure in itself, but suffice to say I friggin’ love them! They’re a different feel than rkp trucks in a number of way:
- there’s no bushing to push against so there’s no resistance to to turn. Initiating a turn is very easy and fluid ...
- but this makes the trucks very tippy. Any slight deviation of you centre-of-balance and you’ll be turning. 
- turns are super linear, and in proportion to your lean. They’re not divey, which I like. 

Because of the cam design, OP trucks are smoooth. The whole feel is fluid and very liquid. I’ll take some photos and upload them later.

edit: I can haz grammah!

Hubs, like hummies where you glue to motors to the axle would be possible. But I think it would difficult to fit an off-the-shelf motor mount. OP trucks are much lower, and the cam takes up a significant length of the axle.

So then the only way we can use this is to put them in the front on a riser pad?  If I can't mount a motor to it, I'm not sure what good it does LoLz

Alright so...
Other Planet trucks COULD be suitable, but with several caveats.

First off lets look at your list of benefits.

**Stable at speed:** Yes, Very stable at speed. This is a valid reason to consider them. If you are only interested in this and not their steering characteristics you could get that by putting an Other Planet Truck only in the rear.

**Change Cam Profiles for different truck feelings:** Um, Technically this is true, but added practicality is pretty minimal. Its a nice thing to be able to do, but its talked about way more than its actually done.

**Easy to swap hanger:** This is an interesting idea. Hangers are pretty easy to swap for sure.
I never really swap hangers, I've never found it that practical. But using it to swap out motors... I could see that.

**Could Standard Motor Mounts be used?:** I do not think so. The hanger would be great to mount a motor onto, its got this nice flat side that would index really well. But... The baseplate is so wide, there's not a ton of space between the baseplate and the wheel. There's also an issue of interference with the baseplate as the trucks lean so far.
Definitely not impossible to mount a motor on there, but it would involve a clever solution, and you probably couldn't find an off the shelf option that would work. The trucks are pretty modifiable, and anybody willing to delve into that would have a lot of mounting options open up for them.

**Has anyone ever tried to diy something similar?:** Yes, there have been a small handful of people who have made their own OPs before referencing only pictures and video. And I'm really open and willing to help anybody wanting to do that with any answers they need.


**Some considerations:**

Because the trucks can lean so far It could complicate the drive train.It would make belts running from the deck to the hanger troublesome I think. Hub motors would be by far the simplest way to circumvent the problem. Or, another way to circumvent the problem... If you're only looking for stability benefits put the OP on the rear, don't motorize it, and motorize the front truck instead. 


As far as DIYing some OPs...
Here's something really cool, for the base plate all that matters are that the two walls are parallel, and for the hanger all that matters is that the two sides are parallel. How Thick the hanger is... doesn't matter. You want a 4" thick hanger? you just need the baseplate walls to be 4" apart. Cant imagine anybody wanting 4" thick hangers for anything, but if you were building your own you could fit anything you need to mount motors to in the hanger, easily.

Short of DIY, you also have some modification options.
The baseplate is big, and that is where a lot of the the problems start. You can actually cut the baseplate down to 3" wide, and use a different flatter cam to achieve a pretty similar feel to a 4" cam, and buy yourself a ton of extra space.
The axles are 1/2 steel in the hanger, so you can actually tap into them if you're very careful ( they're hardened ).

Final thoughts... How suitable they are I think really comes down to what you're wanting to get of your board.
When people ask me if they should get OPs I really drill them on what they're going to be trying to do with them and what they expect, and that same thing applies here. E-skate isn't a riding discipline.

That's what I'd do.  And leave the rear lower than the front, too.  Skip the riser pads

I was thinking, don't mount a motor on the truck hanger.  Mount a *really wide truck hanger with a motor mounted to it* on the OP truck hanger.  So you'd have two hangers on the truck.  Don't even use the axles from the OP hanger; saw them off.

You can't  easily saw them off, they're too hard.
But you can wack them out with a hammer, replace them with grade 8 1/2" threaded rod even if you'd like.

Yeah, not gonna happen easily. Solid steel at 12mm thick. Honestly, the simplest solution is hub motors. They'll avoid a whole bunch of problems, and make it a practical reality.

I rode them and I like them but I don't think it would work with any motors because the power of the motor makes two opposite forces and one of those forces is a twisting of the truck hanger and especially with these I think the turning mechanism would bind up from this torsion.  maybe it wouldn't.    even on regular hangers I notice the rubber bushings take more of a beating than an unpowered board.   when the wheel is powered forward the hanger must take the opposite torsion force.  I think while excellerating or braking it would tighten and u couldn't turn

That's a very good observation. 
I don't think it would be a problem, there's a lot of surface area for the force to distribute against to keep friction low, but still a consideration.

One step that could be taken that I'm really confident would prevent this from ever arising as an issue is the use of [HDPE shims](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uVaZolN4co).
HDPE is a really durable low friction material, and it would make it really very difficult for the hanger to bind up even with  high torsional loads.

I really recommend HDPE shims anyway, they really should have been part of the truck design. They'll keep the trucks in good condition really indefinitely assuming you swap them out as they wear down.

My bets on this truck binding up regardless and I dissuaded someone from fixing hubs to it in the past.  
. I really like this truck though and really liked how it can do super sharp turns easily.  Maybe I'm wrong. Wish I was as if be riding w it.

I'll just have to do a test to see how much force it takes to bind them up I guess.

Sorry this is late, but here are some photos of my OP Trucks. There are one of the first production releases of the OP trucks. Never versions have the same geometry but have a more polished finish. Here's a side shot of the trucks on my ThreeSix double drop, with Orangatang purple Kegels (80mm/83a). 

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/0/e/0e7becac41eb47f1c3cc07eeac9e0aa74e043cfa.jpg" width="666" height="500">


And, here's a closer shot of the trucks themselves. You ca see the hanger resting in the baseplate and this shot quite nicely shot the 17degree angle of the baseplate. The kingpin doesn't fix the hanger as with TKP or RKP trucks ... rather there is a elongated slot in the hanger that allows the whole hanger to roll along the cam. What's not immediately obvious is the size of the baseplate ...

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/7/9/7945dffd0c80027519eb44ec8f07288d9f6e4d9f.jpg" width="375" height="500">


Which you can better see from an overhead shot. The baseplate (Note 1.) is substantially bigger than calibers or paris trucks. When I initially tried to fit them to the ThreeSix double drop, I couldn't get it to fix because the baseplate was bumping the deck (you can see this better in the photo above). I had to create some space with a 1/4" riser (Note 2) and then everything was good. You can also clearly see the small clearance between the wheel and the baseplate. 

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/7/5/75b3864207a6c3d21fb544deb072a9ff8259e974.jpg" width="374" height="500">


There was also some discussion about the lean of the OP trucks. Here's a shot leaning to the left.

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/9/8/9802f50373c67a9b2306a1dbbbe27d4aa888c44b.jpg" width="666" height="500">


Looking from above you can see there's very little in the way of clearance. This shot was taken almost directly above the hanger looking down.

And, you can get a better idea from this shot from the other direction.

[/quote]

By “custome hanger” do you mean, a smaller hanger? The answer would be no, OP trucks require a wider baseplate for the cam. A narrower base place would reduce the length of the cam, and substantially change the trucks dynamics. 

I can see two options for building an estate around these trucks ... either:
1. Extend the hanger. It might be possible to remove the axle and replace it with a longer axle. This would allow more room to mount an electric motor. There will still be clearance issue. 
2. Hub motors. This would be the simplest most direct route, and if I wanted to electrify them, hub motors would be the way I’d do it. 

Having said all that, I have to ask myself if it would be worth the trouble. I love my OP trucks just as they are ... they’re a beautify ride and I doubt adding motors would improve them. I know this is an eskate forum, but I don’t feel the need to electrify *everthing* and these trucks are going to stay just as they are!

I found some trucks made by Flame Mountainboards that seem to be using a similar design. Rather than using O rings for tension they are using a bolt in a bushing that goes through the center of the axel and hanger.

the hanger 
http://www.mountainboard.ru/wp-content/uploads/flame-base.jpg

the Cam Profile:
http://www.mountainboard.ru/wp-content/uploads/flame-reactor.jpg

they seem to have a far smaller cam and rely more on the rubber for return to centre. also cam is on the axel side, not the hanger side. 

Newer versions seem to have moved to cnc'd axel with the cam welded on 
http://www.mountainboard.ru/wp-content/uploads/flame-dirt-pipe-truck.jpg

looks like mounting a motor to these may be easy

Yes i can :blush:
I testing this trucks from Flame Board and build the Motorholder for this as prototype.
Trampa says something that is old he does not know anything about the new version.
And yes there are other trucks for MTB not only Trampa.
My previous experience is that these axes is hard to break down.
The deck and the trucks was build for downhill and it was very stiff.
But Flame Board build for me this deck what was not so stiff and we change 
the rubber in the hanger.
We are just experimenting with different rubber and various thicknesses
So we have softened the truck and made the radius smaller.
To the trucks there are 3 rubber in different sizes so that there is something for every taste
What could be broken in the trucks the bolts on which the holder sits
They can be easily exchanged and you do not have to change the whole truck.
The bolts are made of stainless steel CNC the axis can no longer rust.
The biggest advantage with these axes is you can easily remove the bolts
and the bolts with the gear transmission from us for the AT wheels.
We already have the gearbox in March 2016 tested and after we have driven enough km
to say it works since others have simply copied and sell it here.
we have presented a finished product here in September 2016
And three days later another has posted the same system but only with a couple of gears
But not a finished product.
But one thing is for sure!  the axles and the deck
are hand made in Germany and high quality

Aside from a similar method of construction Flame Mountainboard trucks aren't going to share much else with OPs.
The bushing they use is just a compression bushing, it doesn't act like a cam at all.

If you're wanting to implement qualities of an other planet setup this isn't the solution.

You can fit a mount but it's quite narrow. You'll have to cut a bit of the plastic to get enough clearing on the metal rod. Even then you'll end up with about 1cm free. [That was my prototype mount](https://imgur.com/qWKGmJO), I'm not done yet with the final one.
