I fell hard enough to believe this is a great video. And indeed it is. Maytech and trampa, get your remote shit together. You know it sucks, you don‚Äôt need details how it failed me. 

Enjoy.

Since me and a lot of others are using that particular remote I am genuinely interested how it failed

I think It died while I was going full tilt. The fail safe here was to go full full throttle, and  I got to chose to actively fall (I was stuck in the damn bindings) or scream through an active intersection. 

Sure, operator error. It‚Äôs my damn fault for not tearing it to the ground and building it my way. Also, loop keys on top are a stupid idea. They will short if the board slides upside down like mine did. 

I‚Äôm angry that I knew I shouldn‚Äôt have trusted that remote, but I was like ‚Äúoh hey, brand name‚Äù 

Never again.

I don‚Äôt own that remote but fail save should always be set up by the person who setup the remote and the vescs. 
Maybe that‚Äôs not possible with this remote, but till now I could do that on every remote i had

But the cool part was that the loop keys ground off, and the board didn‚Äôt run away into traffic, stupid loop keys FTW!

Don‚Äôt get that question wrong, really just want to know, no criticism...what you think would be better than xt90s in this case?

How the hell did you manage to get the board upside down while stuck in the bindings?

Maybe true, all I know was, I was stuck at full for more than the time out period and I made the choice to fall strapped in vs hit a car.

I think that one of the morals of this story, is not to use bindings on the road

Nothing. Maybe recessed loopkeys. Maybe keys with a dead man string. I wish I could have yanked them, but it was 2-3 secs to chose a shitty out come. I think it‚Äôs a really rare occurrence. I wish I had telemetry. No Metr Pro on board üôÑ

I blame myself more than the brand names.

Gents, I put myself in timeout for this shitshow. 

I started jogging again and driving my car again (her name is Nina, the 911). 

I was out running in the city and It was bittersweet. It was refreshing, but losing my superpowers, being stuck with dumb human legs was a bummer. 

I hit 135mph on the I5 and my check engine light came on. I don‚Äôt know how to fix it like I could fix a board. I‚Äôm powerless and at the whim of Ze German mechanics.  

Being a non eskate human sucks. Like tony stark without his tech. I‚Äôm just an asshole. üòû
