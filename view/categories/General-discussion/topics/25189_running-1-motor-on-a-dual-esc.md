Hey guys. My friend has a spare dual ESC from APS, but I only run 1 motor and I'm wondering if it's possible to simply run 1 motor off of this dual ESC.
Here's the link: http://alienpowersystem.com/shop/esc/alien-120a-2-7s-evolution-3-esc-bec-twin-sensored/

Will there be issues?

I'm not an expert, but unless there is a way to turn one esc off in the settings then I wouldn't recommend it. Just my opinion. Good luck.

Nope, wont work. Will instantly end smoke as soon as the ESC's attempt to control the motor simultaneously  :sweat_smile: .

I re-read your question, I thought you wanted to put your ESC's outputs parallel, that will not work. You could however use only a single output like you probably suggested.

Wait wiring motor leads in parallel wouldn't work?
