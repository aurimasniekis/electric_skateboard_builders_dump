Hey ESK8 community,

I'd just like to say my official farewell. It's amazing how much we as a community have evolved over the past 4-5 years. It started off with a few smart fellows I believe, turning some hobby grade motors and creating some drivetrains to build these awesome personal electric vehicles. I myself have only made 3 builds in the time I have been on here, and I hope I helped to answer some questions from quite a few people on here. When this forum first started, the small community we had had only developed so much, and it's almost scary to see how far it's come in only 3 years or so. To all the people that made this possible, I'd like to thank you for letting me into such an astonishing community, and spoon feeding my little shit of a personality back in '15. You've all kickstarted me into a world I had never seen before. Being part of this community let me into a lot of things, and I've missed a lot the past year. Riding 50km around the perimeter of Paris with @okp and some of his crew was one of the most fun things I have ever done. I commend @onloop for his work on the Raptor 2, which was an absolute beauty to ride. 

Again, truly thank you all and I wish you all the best in the future.

Special thanks to these guys: @psychotiller @onloop @cmatson @longhairedboy @torqueboards

And probably a few others I'm forgetting.

Peace out!

Mostly too much going on. Hopefully, Iâ€™ll come back in a few years. Getting into racing drones, built my first quad funded by the school for a subject, and starting my PC build with hard earned money from KFC lol.
