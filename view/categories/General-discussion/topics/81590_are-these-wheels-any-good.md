Iâ€™ve been looking and looking for some wheels for one of my builds and happened to notice one of my friend has a HAmboard with these wheels![image|230x500](upload://9kqM5JcdWwj9OJQ6hie8PhwcIKx.jpeg) they seem to have the flywheel hub and have a classic look which I love. Does anyone have any advice, or has anyone had these?
