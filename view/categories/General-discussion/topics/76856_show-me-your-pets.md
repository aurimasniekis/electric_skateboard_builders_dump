Cool people have cool pets right? I've seen a few paws and claws sneaking in some build photos. Let's see what you're working with!

This is my best friend Pirate. He's 7 now and I've had him since he was just a baby. He's an Australian Blue Heeler (cattle dog) and the best adventure companion one could ask for. I have other pets but they suck.

This is Tesla, he is a Doberman Pinscher. He is the first and only dog we've ever had! My parents and I got him when he was just 3 months old, in January he will be turning 2! Strangers say he looks like a strong and mean dog, but don't be fooled; he is a big softie.

This is him when we first brought him home

Kingsley (chocolate male)
Abigail (black female w/diluted gene)
Scarlett (silver female, 10 weeks old)

Abigail had a 13 pup litter. Scarlet came from that litter. Kingsley is not the dad 👀

Just a tiny bit creepy but there's a South Korean company that will take your dogs DNA and clone them into a new puppy. Unfortunately it's roughly 10 grand.

@ethel that coat color is beautiful.

To think I was about to be productive and I see this topic. We have two dogs and a cat. 
I have a 3 and half year old lab/pit mix named Ralphie. He loves to play fetch, pout when he isn't playing fetch, beg for food, and cuddle you like he is a lap dog. My fiancee has 7 year old pit/terrier mix named Milo. He loves being a guard dog, lick you until you can't stand it, beg for food, explore, and be a burrito. Even though they argue sometimes, they are sweetest brothers ever. The cat is named Asha and she likes to shed unlimited fur, make biscuits, scratch things that aren't hers, and be lazy. She and I have a love/hate relationship but that's okay. My fiancee gives her the love she deserves because I just call her bastard anyway.

This was about a week after I got him. Didn't want to come inside because he knew I was about to go to work.

Do chickens count as pets?  We've got 8 chickens that were hand raised from baby chicks.  They free range during the day and are locked up at night.  I even built an automatic door that opens and closes with a timer.

The chickens are great with kids.  They have been a good resource for teaching my kids basic chores and responsibilities.  The chickens eat all our flies, snails, slugs, dandelions and weeds.  They also fertilize and mow the lawn for me.  Did I also mention they make us breakfast every morning?

He is 14 years old and is named J.D. as its short for John Deere as he is as loud as a tractor when he purrs.
He is a bitsa.  a bit of this and that.  A major lap slut.  If you stop patting he moves onto the next person.

This is Mickey

Often thought the same thing. So many people ask if hes a mini staffordshire bull terrier too.

A friend of mine had a black staffy/dachund cross. From certain angles he was a pretty scary looking dog. From literally every other angle he was amusingly adorable

Those jack pug crosses are a great breed tbh.  I'm not one for designer pups but these mixes have been really popular in the uk and now I know why.  They have half the energy of a jack half the appetite of a pug.  None of the related health issues and the most adorable personality. Stocky without being intimidating.  Not the sharpest knife in the draw though.

This is Mittens. Unfortunately she's been missing for a long time now :( but I'm hoping a local family moved away and took her with them. She was very much an outdoors cat and would often go a few days without coming back. I wouldn't be surprised if she had another family taking care of her. She's a good kitty.

Wife got mad when I said I didn't show off the other pets so here they are : 
**Bonnie**
We think she's 3, shelter found her living in the wild. ![20171219_170906|375x500](upload://ezD4keVVhCAa0fSiHES6SjXl0kq.jpeg)
I've never had a dog that hides things in secret stashes before. It's like hotter/colder when I walk by a blanket and she starts growling at me; I know I'm close.

Got her primarily for my wife and son because Pirate is definitely my dog. Took him a year to warm up to my then girlfriend now wife. He is just this year finally warming up to my son. Never aggressive, would just avoid him like the plague.

my sister had a cat, and truth be told, was neglected and one day she didn't come home.

a year later she reappears, looking well fed and pampered, with a new tag and a new name.

so she found herself a new family, and came to visit as if to say, "i'm safe but you're no longer mine."

so...i'm wishing the same for Mittens.

The tabby (Tom) showed up outside my house 2 years ago, back when he was cute and not demonic. Decided to keep him and now he chases our older Siamese around the house for no reason. It's hilarious for us, not sure the old guy agrees.

Chandon is the Siamese, he's about 12 now, bought him from a breeder. Scared of everything that moves or makes noise, otherwise a great cat.

Ya know, I couldn't tell you for certain because she came to me twice rescued. I was first told Catahoula/Pit mix, but after searching Red Heelers on IG, the resemblances were uncanny. She shrieks just like a pit though, there's no denying that. It's her least appealing feature. :laughing:

I don't have really any pets just a betta fish.   Once I get out of my apartment my wife and I plan on getting a Pitbull rescue dog.  We have talked about going to Villalobos because I want to be able to walk it while I skate and I know some dogs are scared of skateboards so I don't want to have that effect the happyness of the dog while on a walk.  

I also really want to try and teach the dog how to skate like tillman the bulldog

> We no longer have any pets. My cat died after 18 years. Our dog died last year after 16 years. It was hard not sure I want my daughter to experience that lost for a looooong time.

I get this.

Had 2 cats, now I don't have any anymore. One was a good cat. Knew some tricks, never scratched, understood where in the house she was allowed in and not allowed in. The other was an ass, but friendly when he wanted to be. 

It's been years since they've gone. I miss and don't miss the ass. I really miss the good one. Not had a pet since. 

Your dog looks like he was a real good boy :slight_smile:

Yours is smart to just hoard them like a dragon and her gold. Whenever mine is able to have access to more than one, he tries to put them all in his mouth. I don't know what his intentions are if he was even able to do so? He drops one getting the other. Attempts to get the one he dropped and drops the second one he had in his mouth and it just loops from there.

Don't get a pitbull.  I had to shoot at one when it attacked my dog, almost killing her.  She did survive.  Not too long after that one of my old neighbors shot and killed that dog because it attacked their kid.  Fuck pitbulls.  I almost had to stab one once because it wouldn't let cross the street to my own apartment.  If I had a gun on me then, I'd have shot that one too.

I fucking love dogs.  Dogs are the best things ever.  But not pitbulls.

Queue the zillion "But pitbulls are loving dogs" comments.  Except they attack people and I will shoot it if it attacks me or my family.  Period.  And not feel sorry.  Don't adopt pitbulls.

im sorry again for what happened, i hope she is better now. i would also have a pure hatred for any dog breed if one attacked my dog viciously, so i don’t want to tell you to agree with my opinion. how is she now?

I'm sure your experience sums up the entirety of an entire breed of dog.... :roll_eyes:

I've owned more than 10 pitbulls in my life.
Not one has every attempted to bite another person or animal.

pit bulls ranked fourth for passing temperament testing out of 122 beads.

For a guy so obsessed with facts and statistics, you would think you wouldn't let your personal experience give you a biased opinion.

Yes lots of pitbull attacks happen.  Because they are very obedient dogs. They do as they are trained/raised. 
People think pitbulls look tough. So guys who want tough attack dogs get them and train them to behave that way. They aren't born that way. 

Look at it this way. 2 door Honda civics are not rase cars. But a bunch of stuip kids treat them like they are. Its not the Honda's fault. Its people. 
People are shitty, not pitbulls.

Like children the worse the upbringing the more likely they are to be a wanker, unfortunately pitbulls are owned by a lot of shit people that shouldn't have kids let alone pets so for me its a trend thing more than it is say the breeding line, as pitbulls are more common in lets say less well to do households than corgis they have a bad rep, you can teach anything child or dog to be a c@nt by being one towards it. 

You don't get bad dogs as much as you do bad owners imo.

Pitbulls are difficult to raise and train properly, and it has to be done at a very early age. They are considered very anxious dogs and get nervous very easily, which is why it is not recommended to keep them in backyards but instead indoors and they have to be socialized constantly and on a regular basis, both with people and dogs.

I'd advise against adopting a Pitbull unless it's really really young and one is willing to spend a whole lot of time properly raising him/her, else stay away because it most likely wasn't raised properly and is dangerous.

I'm not going to delve any further because I know you already been bombarded but I'm just going to say you're wrong. Personal experience does not equate to truth.

This being said, if thugs were fighting dachshunds, they'd be an equally negatively  judged breed. @swimmydude and @Skunk, I truly appreciate your dedication and willingness to provide a presumed solid upbringing of this breed.

They are the sweetest dogs and all were 1-2 years old when adopted. All three are in houses with small children and both house have new borns. Two of them have had two kids that are not the easiest/laidback kids. And have constantly been colored on, pulled on, fallen on.

Yea, they generally have a very mild temperament and are often incredibly sweet dogs. With that said, they are of a bully breed. So they get a bad rep because of the things you guys mentioned. Their jaws are strong and will protect themselves.

My BiL has a farm and refuses to let me bring my dogs with me when I go visit. He's had a few incidents of pitbulls killing and harming his livestock. I get it and understand the frustration, but it's still incredibly shortsighted of him. To him, the only factor is the breed. He has also had to deal with wolves and other pest. My point is just because that has happened doesn't mean it always will or that my dogs will do something. Why? Because I raised them and trained them. 

As you stated @venom121212, if another set of breeds were raised and bred for pit fighting, unregulated attack dogs, etc. They would have the stigma. If someone wants to have a prejudice against them. Go ahead, I can't really change that. Just don't spread it please because under the right care and training. They can be some of the most loyal, loving, and sweetest dogs you'll ever have. But they also aren't for everyone either.

Any dog can be trained to be an aggressive dog back in the 1800 people used sharpei as fighting dogs. In the 70’s Doberman has the bad rap 80’s the rotti’s had the bad rap in the 90’s it was German Shepards now it is the Pitbulls. What a dog really needs is a stern but loving house and you will have one of the best dogs ever. About 15 years ago there was a Dalmatian that was several years old and had been with the family for a long time but there was a new baby in the house and it was crying and would not stop. The parents had left the baby alone with the dog before it started crying when the baby started crying the Dalmatian shook the baby to death. Is it the dogs fault yes and no but it is 100% parents fault to leave a new baby with a dog. Dogs are animals just like humans however humans are the only animals that continually hurt other animals for no reason.

I am most definitely stereotyping an entire breed *because that entire breed was bred for the purpose of being attack and fighting dogs*.  Why folks want them as pets is a mystery.  But they are dangerous to other people around you.  People owning pit bulls is one reason other people need to stay armed.  You wouldn't own a bobcat, would you?  What about a bear?  Maybe a crocodile instead.  Even if the bear was friendly towards you doesn't mean it's not a risk to your community members.

Sigh. Yes and no. First off, even though I'm generalizing it too, pit bull isn't one particular breed. It encompasses a few different breeds and I assume we are talking about the American Staffordish Terrier or Staffordshire Bull Terrier. Bulldogs, Terrier, and American Bully also make of the "pit bull" breed. The reason I am mentioning this is because just on that fact alone means that pit bulls were NOT bred for fighting dogs. Terriers were bred for pest control and even some were for hunting. Bulldogs were bred for bull baiting, hence the name. Despite the origins, they are now really bred for mascots, show dogs, and such. 

But lets assume you are talking about the more referenced and common breeds of pit bulls. Yes, unfortunately the history of the breed does call back to forms of bull baiting. That shit was banned, then eventually moved over to pit fighting. Originally with ratting, or the competition of who could kill the most amount of rats in the shortest amount of time. Then it did go to dog fighting. Here is the thing. You are saying they are aggressive and dangerous to other people, yet all these forms of inhuman practices are all geared to OTHER animals. Not humans, not some weird form of dog and human MMA ring match, or whatever. In fact, the trait of biting other humans/handlers was culled out because why would you want your pit fighting dog to bite you? Of course you don't. These handlers needed to be in close proximity to the dogs. Anyway, after that when some of those breeds came to America they were bred for other purposes such as herding, guarding, and hunters. Honestly that was probably the first time they were actually bred to potentially bite humans. When they were guard dogs. They are incredibly loyal. 

Another reason why they are seen as bad dogs is really due to recent developments when dog fighting became popular in the 80's in America and because it was made illegal years before. So they started to be associated with the criminal element and as a money making commodity. It worked because these assholes took advantage of the breeds' loving temperament that loved any person it would see and be incredibly trusting. 

Dogs have been bred with human development for thousands of years now, they are long past the state of being wild animals. Bears, crocodiles, wolves, tigers, and any other wild animals are just that. Wild. So that comparison doesn't quite work. Yes, you wouldn't keep a monkey or a bear as a pet. It has been done and has been done successfully and unsuccessfully. Your dog is only a risk because of training and the care. Even if was once a risk, doesn't always mean it will be a risk either. That was shown when Micheal Vick's dogs were relocated and given homes. Nearly all 60ish dog were able to be conditioned and re-homed. Some weren't but that is to be expected. There are always exceptions. 

and I'm sorry @tardyparty7 I'm not going to just drop it. This is a subject that is close to me. I respect what b264 has done for this forum and his many great contributions for it but I completely disagree with his assessment on this particular topic. I'll reiterate this again. The breeds of pit bull are not inherently dangerous and a menace. It all depends on the care and training of the dogs. The same with any person. I'm betting the kid that was raised without discipline and love is more than likely to turn out a bad person than one that was raised with it.

But you're not understanding my point. It ISN'T the breed. You had bad experiences with one of them. You mentioned two, but I don't think the not crossing the street really counts but I dunno. It is that and the bad stigma that is affecting your opinion on it. The breed isn't the issue. It's the owners that is the issue. The fucktard of an owner is to blame. I don't understand why at no point in your rant on pit bulls you said anything about the owner because HE is to blame. Not the dog. 

My neighbor dog drives me insane sometimes. Anytime I'm in my backyard, the little fucker barks at me and my dogs. Nonstop. It is really annoying. Do I hate the dog? No. It is the owner that I'm actually annoyed at. They decided to get a dog and basically starve it of attention. That is why he barks at everything. I don't understand why you just won't accept that. I get that you had bad experiences with a particular breed but it isn't the breed dude. I'm sure you have fallen off your skateboard many times. Other than the fact that it is your sole transportation and you don't have much of a choice. You wouldn't let one fall stop you from continue riding.

They are no more dangerous than a chihuahua, chow chow, dobermann, german shepard, rottweiler, great dane, or literally any other goddamn breed of dog. You have stated you lived in a bad area, which assumes the point that you have not so great people that inhabit there. Why would they make good pet owners? The answer is because they don't. Obviously it isn't everyone. I'm not making excuses, I'm just fed up with the fact you had to protect yourself with one bad pitt and now that is the poster dog for all of them. Any incident that involved a little rat dog biting another person or a giant dane is because of nurture, not nature. 

May potentially be biased but this is literally the first thing I Googled. Gives some examples of why the bad rep if you care to read.

@b264 there are no bad dogs, only bad dog owners.  consider maybe the area you're in has shit dog owners.

i've ONLY met nothing but completely sweet pitties and they're one of the most common dogs in my area.

It can't just be bad owners. Bad pitbull owners don't outnumber the amount of bad owners of all other breeds combined. Use logic people.

Pits are barely in the top 100 of most commonly owned dog breeds in the US. Do 60% of all bad dog owners only own 3% of the dog population?

I don't have a dog in this fight btw, I just don't feel like the numbers add up.

I've had a chance to think about this some more. Let's just say they do have the same likelihood to attack as every other dog. Is their tendency to grip and not let go taught or is it an innate characteristic of the breed? To say a chihuahua and a pitbull are equally dangerous is disingenuous and quite frankly, laughable.

It's an excuse designed to deflect attention and "create" some sort of controversy and it's not even worthy of a rebuttal.  I know they are dangerous and I will vote to ban them if it comes to me on a ballot.  And I don't vote to ban *anything*.  Not pot, not esk8, not *anything*, except those.  Because those are dangerous to people around you.

Just to say, I've known plenty of people who adopted pitbulls, and some were used in dog fights, and they were complete goobers. Wouldn't hurt a fly. But they knew what they were doing when they adopted the dogs and were prepared to take the time to work with the dogs, because they knew they needed to else the dogs could end up being vicious.
And on another spectrum, I've also known good people who adopted pitbulls, didn't bother making time to actually work with them, and holy sh*t did those dogs end up being mean as hell. Not towards people mind you, but towards other dogs. Would completely rip apart other dogs (a few incidents already occurred).

Animals are a responsibility, and because a lot of people think they aren't living beings but instead some sort of toy or trophy, don't take proper care of them. Those people shouldn't be adopting any animal period. 

In my experiences, the dog I've had mostly bad experiences with are freaking Chow Chows.

My uncle had a Chow Chow it was actually bigger then the recognized sizes but was purebred and we was a great dog and would protect you when push came to shove.  He actually protected me when a chessie retriever came after me when I was taking the Chow for a walk.  Now that same Chow did nip me and my cousins a few times but because we were playing and running around with him and we stop to take a breath and the dog was still wanting to play.  Scared us at first and made us cry but no harm or injuries.

Nippy is no problem, but I've been cornered by Chow Chows. If my recollection is right, they are also a trickier breed to work with and if not done properly, can turn out pretty bitey.

Thing I really don't like is when owners don't freaking watch their dogs when they set them loose. Especially when they know they aren't trained or have poor temperaments. I use to go for very early morning runs but stopped after being chased, attacked, cornered, etc by dogs who were let out of their house to go for a morning wee and the owners decided they wanted to go back to sleep instead of keeping an eye on their dogs, and lock the dogs out of the house.

The fact that the statistic starts in early 80's when dog fighting became popular again will skew that statistic. I don't have any fact to back that up, but I'm just going off of coincidences here. I would rather see a year by year listing here. These charts and statistics are usually skewed to further an agenda. And again, pit bull encompasses multiple breeds not one such as rottweiler or german shepherd.

Let's look at it this way. If you were bitten by a bigger dog, such as a pit bull breed or you were bitten by a chihuahua, which one are you more likely going to report? Especially since the pit bull probably did do more dangerous. Will a chihuahua kill you? Probably not, but doesn't make it not dangerous. I didn't say they were equally dangerous though, I simply stated they weren't anymore dangerous just because of the breed. This was all stated in my links. 

My fiancee is a vet. Which is partically why I'm so gung-ho about this. She's been bitten by three dogs thus far. One was a pit bull. The other two was a dachshund and a poodle. A goddamn poodle. While there were originally bred for hunting and damn good at it. I would have never guess one was a poodle. Does this mean anything? No, it is a small sample size and one perspective. What she said is that the reasoning wasn't so much the dog breed but their personality. She said the dachshund was the only one who was mean. 

Honestly, at this point I don't really give a shit what you really think on the subject because it's obvious you made up your mind and you don't care. Simply just from personal experience, which makes you so damn worldly and knowledgeable. I just simply wish you just don't continue spewing false narratives because you have shitty fucking owners that live near you. It has been stated multiple times that pit bull breeds will tend to be where other criminals or non-reputable areas just because of the stigma. Which just further propels that stereotype.

This is also in another link I posted, even if just briefly. They do have strong grip, but not inherently stronger than another breed per say. The only characteristic of biting from pit bull breed is to grab and shake what they bite. It doesn't mean that once they have a grip that they can't or won't let go. A chiuahua biting you won't be as big or hard though, and I'm sure it is easier to get out of that. But who is to say that you can't escape a bite from a husky, dane, or a chow chow if they do happen to bite.

And to keep on topic I suppose. Here's some more pictures of my fucking terrifying and dangerous dog. I'll know this now when I take him anywhere public, because you know. I like to live dangerously and endanger everyone when though he is trained and obedient. I guess that doesn't matter because just like someone wearing a hijab, that must mean he is a terrorist. Okay, I'll stop being a passive aggressive asshole.

No. Because there is a dog fighting culture. There are people who buy pit bulls to make them fight. There are people who buy pitbulls because they want a dog they can train to attack others but not themself. There are people who buy pitbulls as an accessory because they are stereotyped as bad ass dogs in movies, music videos and gang culture. 
People don't do that with most dogs.

@Westy I just want to iterate that the last paragraph in my 4 paragraph rant was not directed toward you. I'm sorry about that and if I seemed hostile. I didn't make that clear. It was to b264 because what we're dealing with is textbook prejudice. Regardless if the base of it is valid or not. 

I just want to make clear. Doesn't matter if anyone likes or dislikes any particular animal or breed. Hell, even if someone suggest someone else to get a particular breed or not, as long as it's factual. For example, I wouldn't suggest anyone who was constantly busy or doesn't a high level of commitment to get a husky or Australian Shepard since those dogs are active and need lots of exercise. Or whatever. But not when the reason you shouldn't get a dog is because of stigma. Nah, don't get a pet if you're going to be a shitty owner. Don't have a child if you're going to be a bad parent. Similar logic really.

Thanks bro.. this is a 3rd generation Pitbull. When i was a baby we had a pit, that pit grew up with and raised another pit which grewup a d raised this one. Kindest dogs ever!!! Pancho even saved my life. He was rescued from my uncle who had bought him to fight. My dad took him away almost as soon as my uncle got him to prevent anything happening to that puppy. Shitty Pitbull pretty much come from shitty owners

I can’t get a dog in San Francisco because of my landlord. 

However, when I come stay in SoCal there’s these two guys that come in every morning and ruff me up. I’m lying here half awake and these guys run in and start licking my face. The crazy thing is, most of the time they aren’t even wearing pants. Reminds me of prison.

That's the single most common guess we get. Thought so ourselves until the DNA test came back in. She was a puppy mill rescue and hadn't really been outside or in a car when we adopted her at about 5 months old.

Edit: fuck it you guys are just gonna have to deal with my love for my dog right now. Bonus puppy picture from the day she came home:

Yep, she's the most amazing dog I've ever had. Super attentive, extremely emotional, crazy smart, learns tricks in a few hours with only a couple days of repetition to make it stick. And despite what people say, shes extremely good with children and other animals. She also responds with the appropriate amount of force to deter a threat and knows when someone picks something up to be used as a weapon. She hates guns and knives the most. Ill never choose another breed over Belgians. Their temperament and nature matches mine almost to closely, lol.

That's sad to hear man. I dread the day that I'll have to do the same with my little Cleo. She's only 4 but she has some issues (brain tremors, her whole spine is fused, ect...). We got so lucky and rescued her from the pound. We've already spent almost 20k in medical bills for her. But she's definitely worth it!!!

Omg fuck..really her name is Cleo..that was the first name for a the first six months haveing her then it became lil miss piggy as she sounded like a wild piggy in the fields chasing us on dirt bikes...she answered to both names..I got lucky mine didn't have issues to badly she had cherry eye ..she was wild 70 pounds of fury I watched her take a cr 250 dirt bike tire off the rim of a friend as he was riding ..these dog were bread for wild horse and bull catching back in the day.... I tryed all the procedure to fix other then removing it as it causes dry eye..I took the chance send was fine with it never lost eye site never got dry eye either it didn't bother her as my neighbor kids would poke her eyes like kids do..never grumbled ever at a kid ..loved them .. I find with bully's there are alot of issues but if you let them be like normal dogs swim with life jacket run and play like normal dogs they last alot longer..bring lots of water we're ever you go.. ppl make them lazy and that's why there life span is only 6 to 8 years..mine lasted three months shy of 15 years old maybe close to world record not sure I haven't looked ..still kills me..take care of that gem ..I can't believe they had the same name too at first..lol..I'll get some pics up..god bless bully's..
Cheers

I found some pictures of when she was very young and some recent, pre-haircut :joy:  Maybe Ill post again when her coat fills out again

A very young kitty, we got Clyde at 6 months. I think shes around a 1.5 years old here ( Its my moms cat, so she decided Clyde was suiting because when running, her paws smack the round really loudly. I just think she runs funny... lol.) Her little orange patch is so cute ;-; 
![DSC_0319|690x459](upload://wZQtzncXTA7FNfAMVxCiozXUgWT.jpeg) 

She slept with me every night while I had the top half bunk bed/ bottom half desk area, it was our fortress :P  Unfortunately we moved out of this apartment and into the house I currently live in, and I grew out of the bed anyways. I don't remember what I did to warrant such a stare :sob: :joy:

Here is a fairly recent photo, probably from 2 years ago. Since then her coat has gotten much fluffier, and looks way cooler... lol.

That wallpaper didn't last more than a week... I don't know what my mom was thinking :thinking:  ![DSC_0756|690x459](upload://iSWWtsGpySIQX0WYJJNFfoVrL7.jpeg)

if anyones intrested ill have a litter of purebreed,adorable, potty trained, socailized, very smart (you can teach them tricks and there smarter than dogs) holland lop rabbits ready by christmas im asking 150 -200 depending on color and demand I dont ship rabbits but if you can arrange someone to pick up your rabbit that would be fine though i perfer you to come in person so i can show you how to take care of your rabbit properly (pet stores lie to you often resalts in sick unhealthy rabbits) rabbits will be ready for pick up end of november? beginning of december (mom is tan one creamsicle dad is black one timmy) they grow 2-3 1/2 pounds btw im in cincinnati ohio  and the rabbits are usually reserved two weeks after their born so if your intrested  and there arent any bunnies left i can put you on the waiting list theres approx 1-5 bunnies per litter first come first serve

I also sell cages and each rabbit comes with food for about 5 days and you can buy more from me if u need it urgently or just buy more online the bunnies can be ready to go before Halloween but might not be fully litter trained if that matters or end/ mid November guaranteed litter trained the  most an unnueatured/spayed rabbit can be
