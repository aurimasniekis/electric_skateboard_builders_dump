The words out I ride goofy. Its usually fine except for now with my mountain board my left foot has to be in front and I can barley ride the thing. I knew this would be a problem but I thought I could over come.  So now I have two options painstakingly learn how to ride the regular way and risk busting my ass while my feet are strapped to the board. Or just flip the bindings... 

What do you guys think

goofy here as well- 

for all my friends the boards I ride are toe side, but for me, they are heel side; tried to learn the other way, but its a pain.

Hahah I'm so happy to see other goofy riders I thought i was the only one !!! Hola! @treenutter @cmatson @Blasto


Okay so the issue is remounting the bindings seems like a lot of work and the holes under the feet of the board are made for regular riders. And the grip tape too. I'll show you. <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/8/8401106149b29ef27b65046f506f4f5fb35ab7f8.png" width="281" height="500">


You see the holes under the feet? and the grip tape the bindings are the least of my worries

You could unmount trucks sand electronics if needed and just turn the deck around if you dont want to drill new holes and mess with griptape.

the trampa is 100% symmetric, isnt it? so you can ride it in either direction with the same binding setup, i.e. it fits goofy and regular?

im VERY puzzled right now :confused:

If I flip the deck and not the bindings my feet will be facing toe in

Started snowboarding goofy and started to get serious with the sport so learned to ride switch, now I can ride regular darn near as well as goofy, which is incredible handy if you don't have motors on your longboard since you can share the pushing load on both sides. 
Definitely prefer my natural goofy instincts though!

My name is Mike, and I've been goofy footed for 20 years. I am not alone.

Wait a tick, what hand do you all use for remote and which is your dominate hand?

I'm right handed and I always, ALWAYS use left hand for eskate remotes, even finicky ones with minuscule travel.

Bunch of suits riding around plain old longboards looking exactly the same with stern looks on their faces, obviously not riding for fun but for business. One of the suits you can tell is starting to feel something, catches his self rocking his head to some tunes a guy on the street is playing, avoids a rock on the road buy carving and does it a couple more times afterwards, his stance and posture starts to loosen up some. Each day something new changes on him, some colour on his suit somewhere, some rocking shades, couple stickers on his helmet, some colourful converse sneakers, a few buttons undone, till eventually he is riding goofy and carving around, powering up hills, getting some slides in, rocking a custom made longboard all topped off with some seriously goofy styledrobe. End of the video he obviously gets the girl and rides off goofy into the sunset throwing his tie in the wind with some text at the end saying something clever about standing out of the regular crowd.

Your stance depends on which foot you use to support your body weight (in general, not just skateboarding). You use your right foot for balance, that's why you ride goofy. People who use their left foot for balance ride regular. That is why regular feels un-natural to you. You can test this with any rider by lightly pushing them backwards when they are standing still, and then looking to see what foot they step back with to keep their balance.

I'd say learn to ride both @barajabali , just to have the skill. I wakeboard as well as longboard and when I learned how to jump the wake the next step was 180's, so I spent a few months learning how to ride goofy. This translated to Longboarding and I find it very helpful because when my knees get tired I can just switch sides and it's like everything is totally refreshed.

I also push goofy, but I'm right handed. Much easier to balance and steer with right foot in front while pushing.

There are a lot of goofy riders here, but how many push mongo? For whatever reason more than 50% of people I see boarding these days push mongo. Beats the hell out of me how that even occurs to people, you've gotta twist your whole body around every time you push! Not to mention footbraking mongo is hella dangerous

Yea I could have just put the mount at the other end but I would have to undo the bracket which is already on really tightly with thread lock. It was easier for me to just swap the hanger and flip the electronics. I would have had to switch the electronics either way. 

Either method would have worked

Philosophical question: If you're left-handed, is it really goofy? I am also left handed and goofy, but I've often pondered this question. For a lefty, this is actually a regular stance. It's only goofy if you're right handed.

Not a terribly important point, just sayin'.
