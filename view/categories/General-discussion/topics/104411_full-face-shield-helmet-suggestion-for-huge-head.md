Hey everyone, quick helmet question: I found a list of full face shield helmets with superior safety ratings (like the TSG Pass) but none of the helmets are big enough to fit my huge dome (63.5cm; size 8 hat). The only helmets with a full face shield large enough are ones not on the list (like a Ruroc. pro: fits my head and full face shield and lighter than a motorcycle helmet similarly priced; con: doesn't have the superior rating) or motorcycle helmets (like a Bell. pro: fits my head and has superior safety ratings compared to the Ruroc. con: I've heard their field of view is crap). Any suggestions? Thank you!

This helmet In L/XL I found too large for my size 61 head.
It may just fit?

Try a Fox Pro Frame XL? Will probably have to swap pads out of the box (included in purchase, just not what comes on the helm from factory)

Sweet helmet.
