So i got some of the sr rkps 200mm and i am looking for a board to use with trampa 6.5 urban treads. I found the madrid paddle https://www.daddiesboardshop.com/checkout/cart/configure/id/21831023/
And the eastside blazer v2 https://www.daddiesboardshop.com/checkout/cart/configure/id/21828468/
I want a mini drop to lock my feet and i am a moderate sized human at 6'4 210 pounds.  Thanks for any help. Matt.

I'm 99% sure that daddies is a scam, or at least not truthful...

I read the reviews for that second deck. I struggled to find a single one that was actually about the product, just how nice their website and selection is..

I got my evo from there, wasn't exactly a see through group of people... had to fight a little if I remember correctly. 

Wouldn't do business again, muirskate is highly regarded among community members.
