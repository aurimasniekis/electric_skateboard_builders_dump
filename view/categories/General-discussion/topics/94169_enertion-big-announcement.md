The wheels have been made in the boosted factory since the second revision of the wheel formula. I know this cause Jason sent me a PM with pictures of the factory along time ago so this is nothing new i dont know why they are acting like its new info.

As per usual fashion. Enertion probably just needs to fund something that some of you will get within a year or so. Good luck dealing with the marketing hype boys.

I'd expect nothing less than

"We ran out of money to fulfill our pending orders, so we need to start a preorder for Raptor 2.2 so we can use that money to ship the 2.1s.  We will figure out later how to fix the 2.2 customers"

except reworded by a marketing professional.

Travel battery is my guess. 

Im not an EE, but If they were really smart it would be engineered like two or three individual flightsafe (no greater than 99wh) batteries packed together. Like the power tool flexvolt batteries that when connected a few terminals get connected linked.the Wh doubles/triples.

I know, pure conjecture.

I THINK I may have found out what it is...üßê üëáüèæ
                   
               **On the Horizon**

We've been developing something special behind the scenes, and we're stoked to announce that we're developing the next generation of the Nano X hand controller!

Keeping the same form factor as a base, but with a reimagined design, a super premium luxury feel, all-new circuitry and functionality, this next-gen remote will be the dream controller for the esk8 rider who demands precision, style, and above all else, unprecedented sensitivity, control and reliability.

Check out the sneek peak below!

I promise it won't be anything like the OSRR... Those are $75 control sticks at cost. I would bet enertion will pay about $20 in bulk per nano x controller, and then sell at $120 or something crazy. They defiantly are NOT using the same quality thumb/trigger sticks.
