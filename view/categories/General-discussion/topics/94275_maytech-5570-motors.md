Saw these on the maytech site. I like that they made something smaller with that big bearing. I wonder how they perform, search results yielded zilch. But I'm thinking of getting a set for science and to possibly replace my 6374's c1's. They are sort of heavy. Anyone used these before?

Would certainly be interesting to see how this performs in comparison with other 55mm motors. Might be a good choice for DIY builds with Evolve trucks and mounts.

I wonder of that means it will come battle hardened with epoxy on the coils and magnets

But a skinny girth.  Give me a good 10mm shoulder bolt anytime.

Shaft girth is much more important than shaft length, but its always better to have a longer shaft than a shorter one.  :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

What I mean to say is you can always cut a longer shaft down to size... :open_mouth:
