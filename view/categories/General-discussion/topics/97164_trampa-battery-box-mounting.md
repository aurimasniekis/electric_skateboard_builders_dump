Can anyone tell me how those boxes mount onto the deck? Or a picture.

Would be helpful.

They hey three screws in the middle across the board. They’re bolted that way and then rubber grommet things are connected. 

Personally I’m going with a pelicase setup on mine. ![image|666x500](upload://zx11nenG9LkGrdUkxrveqBDgZ0m.jpeg) 

I’m then strapping it across the board with a Velcro strap.

There should be some info on their website. I found this image:

Products -> Battery Boxes

Seems pretty verbose... loads of info there. I went for a pelicase style box as I really couldn't justify the £175 vs £45 on my build.

Not knocking them - great guys, they're clearly bespoke houstings and made for the job, but my goal was the cheapest Trampa based setup I can build as my first board. I'll post some pictures etc once I've got it running. I'm currently being marred by a lack of 4mm plugs, and some cables... was expecting to get out this weekend, but it'll need to wait until next week now :frowning:

@Lumaci 
I went with a pelican clone. It's mounted on a trampa holypro carver

I have done it this way with my peli case.

How do you guys deal with bottoming out when the bolts protrude that much?

Maybe they act like spacers so you dont scratch the deck :D

What do you mean by bottoming out? I used clevis pins so the board can still flex without breaking the case. As for the length of the pins under the board, grind off what you don't need. I took em universal so they fit pretty much any length I need without the fuss of figuring out the thickness that was needed.
Also, in between the case and the board there's dead space because of the case having legs, so I couldn't use screws.
