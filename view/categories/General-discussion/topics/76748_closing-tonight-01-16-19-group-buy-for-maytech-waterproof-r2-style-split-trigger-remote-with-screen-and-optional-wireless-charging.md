Maytech Rep has indicated to me that the new R2 style split trigger remote will be ready to ship at the end of December.
we are still waiting on final product pictures. she said once the first units come off the production line she will update us.
The individual price per unit is $200 including shipping.....with a charging pad
                                                $180 including shipping .....without charging pad 
 
If we can get 20 units minimum we can reduce this price

unit #1 R2 STYLE W/CHARGE PAD          $160
WATERPROOF up to 2 meters of sea water
wireless charging pad/function
stable signal connection 
LED display

unit #2 R2 STYLE  NO CHARGE PAD       $140
WATERPROOF  up to 2 meters of sea water
wireless charge function/ NO CHARGE PAD
stable signal connection 
LED display

I'm bringing this up because we can save a little on shipping because they will be ready at the same time the bulk 6880 MTO group buy order. 

I have a request for more info on the screen and the system used. 
pending pictures and information requested I think this has a good chance of making a successful group buy.
please let us know your thoughts....![57%20PM|689x500](upload://eSC9VwYXDdKQB1PEZjPp3cFEg4C.png)

I see what you're saying but It'll need a little more waterproofing than to 2m if they want it to be used was a foil remote. 
I think we could be their guinea pigs and get them a little cheaper. It's not like they've tested a finished product by the look of the shonky photos?

I would hate to think that after a fall the waterproof seal might not even be guaranteed, depending on how hard the remote comes down of course... :man_shrugging:

also If I press both triggers at once.... what happens? What would the remote tell the vesc to do :thinking:

Im into it BUT its hard to eat a +$100 remote that no esk8 members have gotten their hands on yet. 
The hoyt sold because trusted members said it was worth the price. 
I like the looks and im cool with the 140 price tag.  But it's a hard sell with so many flop remotes out there.

if we can find a few interested in testing some I can get a small number (up to 5) for $130 sample price because we are a distributor for maytech.

And that's a one-time thing and won't last long after it's in stock.

@mmaner @sender I didn’t know you guys would be into a jet surf! I’ve already started the conception of this build. I’ve been sourcing parts and learning about the dynamics. It’s fairly expensive, but manufactured these boards sell for $15k plus. Lots of info out there though and I will have a dual jet built within 2019. Mark my words.

I just don't understand why all of these remotes are so expensive.

The BOM is literally under $10 for every one of them (considering bulk pricing of course).

The markup is like, 10-15x. We saw the same with enertions remote. That thing was $100 and black Friday, he sells for $23 and still makes a profit...

I'm still temped to make one and under cut everyone because the community is getting ripped off on remotes.

Oh I totally agree with you! When I saw the price tag I thought maybe I choose the wrong career. It occurred that building electric jet surf boards is a much better option and more fun! Anyway, I’ll put a few thousand dollars and my creative mind to work, and I’m sure I’ll be ripping up and down waves and if there isn't any swell, that’s ok too!

There are tooling up costs, engineering costs, testing costs... All of those have to be recouped for a product to achieve profitability. The more that are sold the lower the cost will be. It's the method all commercial releases use.

I get that, charge me $80, you just made 10x profit on me and recouped $70 per person in those costs. I mean, at most, it cost a few thousand to design and make. 100 people buy it at $80 and you make 7k in profit, more than the cost and a healthy profit. And you know you'll likely sell way more than 100...

I just think there's no cheap competition, and that's why they can get away with it.

My only thing is most DIYish purchased remotes seem... very and feel very DIY.  I mean I get it, but still.  

I had high hopes for my firefly, but just wasn't what I wanted.

That being said, if you can pull off a fine feeling and well put together remote, I would be totally be down to get one!

That’s called business, it’s free enterprise. If a company creates a product, and decides to sell it for 1 million dollars, but only costs $5 to manufacture, you have a few choices, create your own, don’t buy, or do buy. It’s a completely futile effort to point out that it’s seems unfair. If you truly don’t like it, don’t complain my friend, DO BETTER. Create your own and you too can profit, or give it away and become a profit. Let’s not forget, this industry no matter the expense is epic, after all it could be like the 90’s still and actually have to walk up hills! F that! 😴🤔🤪

I’m just stating why I refuse to buy any of these remotes.

At some point, it’s gouging. At some point, it’s unethical. Yes buisness is buisness and they can do what they want. We would be living in a far worse world though if there were no ethics.

I think charging this much for a remote is unethical.

I'm not sure morality needs to be applied to supply and demand.

Once there are 10 remotes on the market with telemetry these will be $50. It's just business.

I agree it’s a lot. No dispute there. However, this community is based on the concept of DIY, so many of us out there have had the exact same thought that you are currently expressing, but instead of making a point of ethics, thought maybe I can do better. So many examples right here on this forum. I’m just saying I agree sometimes a company has too much pride in their work and greed consumes them as money is the root of all evils. But in the essence of what we are made of, let’s collectively create a better remote, let’s sell it to the community at a great price, but let’s stop having exhausting conversations about a product costing too much or a company charging too much. That’s their prerogative and if it’s truly too much, it won’t continue to sell. It will work itself out. Or if it’s valuable like say a Ferrari vs a Honda, then your argument of cost vs what you think is a fair price is dead.

From a reseller standpoint. 
volume creates the ability to lower the prices, but most chose to keep it at max profit level..

at high order numbers its possible to reduce the end-user price. 
unfortunately, we rely on these companies to do most of the R/D and hope it fits.
I agree, its a cost issue, it will take a few companies that are not profit driven at first but see the long-term investment of making people aware of the product and making them available at a better price through group buys and intended lower prices in regular sells.

I'm sorry, I can't understand the logic here. That watch has a 1000% markup on it and is built by 13 year old children who are chained to the tables by fear. You're concerned about a markup on a remote?

Look, we have people here saying a diebiems for $100 is too much for a bms, but then they'll spend $180 for a remote? I just think there's more important parts of a board to spend your money on.

If they made a remote as polished and nice of a finish as an apple watch, I would pay $180 for it. This looks like a 3d printed case though with a huge line off centered at that,

Yes,  Under the old supply and demand model its PROFIT based
We look at it a bit differently because of the type of industry it is.
 In this industry, you must create the demand to drive the volume and the ability to bring quality products at good prices. And it up to the resellers to not price gouge.....
but be honest with so much low-quality stuff on the market it's hard to sift through the shit

True, this is far more for efoil than it is esk8. A water-resistant version is more cost suited. Though I do pray for those with this remote (I really do not trust maytech remotes anymore). Please take proper precautions, especially around stoplights.

What we want to accomplish by hosting group buys and selling the samples at low price so we can get them in the hands of the builders and get real non-bias feedback. Also we just can’t test all this shit!  
Your response to the new products helps us decide on what to carry for the year.  Honest reporting like @mmaner just gave on the flipsky nano clone remote. 
It has major potential for the budget builds. 
I think I can retail those at 45$ your thoughts @mmaner? 
I will also have a reasonably priced push to start switch available. @mixedcreation I will have it out to you for a replacement ( test ) on the 12s build.

I remember, that...
and that happened on one we were testing, we popped open the enclosure and found application film still on the heat transfer pad.
So basically it was overheating because it couldn't transfer heat.

Being Maytech, it will be tested to an extent. 
Given the product application ( wide range ) 
From esk8 to fighting robots I can’t honestly say it’s been put through real application trials. 
Because it’s a Maytech product and I know it has been tested the same as other escs they manufacture it has a bit more merit than a completely new company and new product. 

So a short answer would be no, 
This will be real application product testing with honest reporting.

I’d be interested in one of these remotes w/o a charging pad since I already have one I use to charge my iPhone.

Is it still just a 2.4ghz remote at its core?

$140 is pricey, but still significantly cheaper than the Hoyt puck and that remote supposedly has problems in cold temps and no display.

In all honesty, haven't ridden that setup much.  Mostly because I have been riding my dual 6374's.  Also, I need new wheel pulleys as the 15mm only allows for a few threads on my locknut to keep my Popoca's on the truck.  

Besides all that, it pulls......and pulls hard.  I enjoy the setup, and will need to get a METR pro for this board as well.  See what numbers I am getting when going up these damn hills in my area.

Updates for Maytech waterproof remote: 
If connect receiver to BATT+, the screen can show 3-14s battery power. 
Customer can adjust "2. Batt" (3.2V/S or 3.7V/S) and "3. Batt. Num" (1-14s) accoding to their battery.
And because the battery voltage indicator has 10% tolerance. So it's better to set batt number 1S less than actual battery S.  (For example, if your battery is 3.7V, 6S, it's better to set remote Batt.Num to 5.)

Any details on how to set it up, and what it does when voltage exceeds the vesc limit?

If this would allow us to crank up the brake force without harming the battery it would be awesome.

## \#214 Posted by: hyperIon1 Posted at: 2019-01-17T00:54:01.383Z Reads: 162

The main Function of the unit is to prevent the voltage exceeding the escs limits. And after speaking with Benjamin about it, the unit would work in a time that volts being regenerated back through the esc to the battery. With that and your BMS (direct discharge), the two would manage any overage in charge spike and capacity. So if you were hard braking and the volts coming back through the esc exceeded 57v the brake would engage, if an overcharge limit is reached in the pack the bms  overcharge function  will engage and bleed off excess

Hey Guys, 
  Just wanted to update everyone in general and I will follow up with those that need tracking, if you paid an invoice through PayPal your tracking will be attached to the invoice details, please check there. 
The remotes came in yesterday and 2 were damaged from shipping. 
(2) customers will have to wait a few weeks for the remote (Maytech return from holiday) Being the last two to order the wait won't be that long. I will contact these individuals directly. We also had 4 damaged 2 6880 and 2 6374 sealed motors and 4 were not ready to ship 6374 unsealed ( still in production )
The USA GB 6880 motors have shipped out, I will send tracking to those guys. 
We have about 8 of the MT6.6 SESC 200A available at the GB price of $165 after they are gone the price will be close to $200 each.
The remotes are on the way to those who ordered one, and any further orders for those will be $180 for remote with charge pad and $160 without. 
We will have 12s brakes in a month or so if you got one please use on a 10s setup, I will send those who wanted it for 12s a replacement when available. 
We have been testing the MT switch and so far it's holding up. @mixedcreation, @Holyman92, @Skunk, @Sender, and a few others I have included a switch for you to try in your orders. 
@sender I'm still looking for a box big enough for all your shit......

Triggers feel nice, good level of resistance and decent amount of travel, connecting this up to my build over the weekend.

Mine came in today and it feels great! Any written instructions on programming/operation? I've been fiddling around with it not hooked up yet. I can only get it to wake up when I put it on a charger and take it off.

There is a button on the left side that powers up the remote and helps you with choosing the options

You will also have to seitch it from esurf to Esk8 mode to get it to work

Holy shit that's a button! I even made the comment to my wife that they chose to favor right handed people because I thought it was just a groove. Wow that's sleak. Thanks dude.

@EileenMaytech, can you comment on how the battery reading is supposed to work? I watched your video on Facebook but I don't get a second yellow battery meter. I get the 5 bars on the left side in blue that don't correlate to battery voltage.

they are way behind on the manuals, you actually have a V2  (R2V2) that has a cruise control function for the surf side.

you also have to connect the + side of the battery to the reciever

I got that done already. The 5 blue bars didn't show up until after I connected the receiver to batt+ so it's getting some some feedback through that channel. Just not sure what it's trying to display and why the second battery meter isn't there.

Hey I tried connecting the high voltage connection for my flipsky VX1 receiver to that voltmeter port on the unity and it didn’t work. I ended up splicing it into my charging circuit, which did work.

I think it may have something to do with the voltmeter port on the unity having a different ground than the rest of the board? If you measure the voltage across the pins of that voltmeter port you get the voltage of your battery. But if you measure the voltage from the positive pin of that port to another ground on your board you’ll get 0V.

Nice! Thank you for saving me the exact plan I was going to do tomorrow. I was told only positive needed connected but we'll see. 

@hyperIon1 unfortunately that blue bar doesn't currently reflect battery gauge for me. Maybe once I do @scream's suggestion it will work. I'll get back to you tomorrow. Thanks!

I would connect it to the positive end of your battery pack anywhere along the line before it enters your esc.

Yeah it’s this weird thing with the Unity though. There’s a dedicated jst port on it for a voltmeter to plug into. It’s super useful for an lcd voltmeter.

It does seem like the logical place to put the voltage wire for remote receiver applications cos that’s kinda what it’s there for, and it’s appropriately fused. But it doesn’t give a good voltage read between the high side and another ground. Must be on a separate circuit.

It's taking much longer than expected to drain the battery, thanks @hyperIon1. Has been on full throttle on blocks for almost an hour.

So I should see the first bar drop ~80% battery?

Here is proof of wiring.

Finally! I cheated and set it back to 10s to make the process change over faster. I'll test later back on 9s as originally suggested for a 10s battery.

set to 9s for 10s batttery is only for the first batch remotes. 
We adjusted the firmware. It shows more accurate than before.
