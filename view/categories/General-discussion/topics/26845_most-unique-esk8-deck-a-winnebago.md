Fun.  Nice Enertion parts cameo... too bad he calls it a "Boosted Electric Winnebago"...

Yeah Peter's channel and other content he participates in like FliteTest are both pretty good I learned a lot about quadcopters and LiPos from their stuff and usually entertaining.

Their LiPo safety video is really good and they have one on Corrosion-X where they water proof a bunch of components and dump them in a salt water bath and run them.
