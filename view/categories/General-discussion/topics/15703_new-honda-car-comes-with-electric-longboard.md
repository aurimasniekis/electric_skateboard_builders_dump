Well these companies have allot of resources to make something good, will be interesting to see if they invest in it or use it as a cheap "marketing gimmick"

So what happens to the battery in the board if you park the car in the sun on a hot day?

What will the car temperature be? 60Â°C? I think the battery can handle that
