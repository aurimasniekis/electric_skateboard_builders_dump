I'm trying to build out my whole board setup in Solidworks so I know everything will fit just as intended. I'm intending to press a few custom decks but want to ensure I have enough motor mount clearance for any weight rider. 

If anyone out there that owns the Unik (or LHB) core series motor mounts help me with a few dimensions from them?

I took some measurement to design a belt cover for the unik mount, might not be ultra accurate but here is what i got.

Distance from the center of the hanger axle to the extremity of the mount : 105mm
Width (heigth, diameter or whatever) at the widest (the mount sides aren't parallel) : 50mm

For the gap it would depend on your baseplate angle i guess, i haven't measured it yet but i can check tomorrow if you want. It's currently mounted on a 44° baseplate.

EDIT : For the 44° baseplate, the gap is about 7mm
