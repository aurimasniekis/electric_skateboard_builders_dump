Those wheels use 10mm shaft. TB 218mm uses standard skate size, 8mm. From what I have searched no other E-MTB uses 10mm shaft. But, if you find appropriate bearings you might be able to use other shaft diameters.

Trampa Street/Urban Carver mini ATB spring trucks have 10mm shaft and for the bigger version ATB spring trucks are 12mm

I thought 9.525mm =/= 10mm in axle diameter. It's a 1/2mm difference, which I would think matters in bearing tolerance. I have not owned Trampa trucks, I only have 10mm trucks from DIYeboard. I don't think Trampa's 9.525mm bearings fit 10mm axle from DIYeboard..

Hi Guys, can you tell is there any way to fit this wheels on MBS Matrix 2 trucks if I change the bearings on them with 12mm 30mm 8mm ones?

Kind regards

Hi, i was wondering if you found a solution to this? Did you ever buy this setup because im actually doing the same. Im an impulse buyer ðŸ˜… and i bought the wheels without checking the axle size 1st. Im currently looking for some bearings to make them fit. I have 6354 motors and with a bit of sawing off about 7mm of the hanger, it should be no problem to get everything to fit....except the bearing. Any ideas???
