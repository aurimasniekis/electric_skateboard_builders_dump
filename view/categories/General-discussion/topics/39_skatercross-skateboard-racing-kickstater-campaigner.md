**Imagine a course like this for electric skateboards!** I think the launch ramp sections could be a problem though, maybe need feet straps otherwise i think our boards would be a bit too heavy..only one way to find out....Also the length of the track would need to be much longer so you can reach top speeds.... how awesome would those corners be at 40km/h
