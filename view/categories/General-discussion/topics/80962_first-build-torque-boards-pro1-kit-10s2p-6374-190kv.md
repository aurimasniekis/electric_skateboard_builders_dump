I'm planning on building my first board and I was wondering if anyone has a similar setup or if they have this kit. I don't really know how to program a VESC, I don't know if I should use 12mm or 15mm belts, and I don't know where to look for a good deck around $30.

There are plenty of VESCtool tutorials, google is your friend,default settings is alright to start with.
you'll be fine with either 12 or 15mm.
deck for 30 bucks? A thick sheet of plywood maybe? xD 

If you looking for cheap, then you're better off looking on fleamarkets or 2nd hand decks, you wont find many good decks for that money.

I reccomend 8 ply or 9 ply

Here is a really good deck it you willing to pay an extra 30 dollars to get a good new deck with griptape.

Also remeber Buy Cheap Buy twice.
