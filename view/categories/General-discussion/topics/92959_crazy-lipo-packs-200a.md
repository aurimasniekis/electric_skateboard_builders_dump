Check these out

8AH at 200A

These things look mental for the price/ form factor. Obviously, they still have the advantages/disadvantages of lipo, but it could be cool to see these in a build, maybe a mtb or something.

Just thought id share :)

While normally id agree (shady ebay sellers and all that), these ones have actually been tested by [Jehu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nmDj0Ykn-c) (i dislike the guy but the review is relevant) , i mean who knows they could be gobshite for esk8, but figured it was relevant

I'm currently building a board with them: https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/my-freak-for-slippery-sidewalk-and-heavy-rider-on-a-budget/92753/9
I did some tests without problem, but i'm waiting for my FocBox to ride test "for real".

It's not shady, alarmhookup is a trusted source in the diypowerwall community, and has been rated by jehu (lots of his stuff he don't know what he is talking about)

How did you make your pack? Im going to use 2 aprox 1cmx8cmx2mm aluminum plates with 2 m4 both and nut/washer with smallest profile to keep the busbar "thinner" than the 2 pouches stacked as to not interfere with the bar and nuts above. Then wrap each connection in kapton and electrical tape to insulate. Im not sure how to connect positive and negative to the bar though think ill just use copper plates for the + and - of the pack

#6 x 3/16" machine screws with #8 fender washers. Use these on the bolt holes. For the positive and negative terminals, I used a 1/4"-20 x 3/8" with a ring terminal.

Handles 70A no problem.

To give you a sense of how rugged this setup is, I covered the enclosure I made for it in some PU foam.
I flipped my board over and cracked my skull.

Board came out unscathed and worked no problem.

Ouch. I'm guessing You just used bolts and washers to hold the + and - tabs together? No busbar? How big are the enclosures? Did you trim the "excess" material from the batteries to compact them or fold it over? Frigging going through all the batteries to charge and check resistance is getting to be a pain 42 batteries is a lot to work through. Did you put much time into grouping them with similar resistance?

Nothing wrong with the batteries you just have to actually understand how internal resistance, capacity(because theyre used and youre not getting batteries that were grouped together) and how to connect them together to handle the high current. I was playing with them the other day melting wire. Good times. Be careful

the enclosure was big, 24" x 7" x 2"

No busbars, just washers and machine screws, and no problems.

I did not trim any material. I stacked it 5x2, meaning 2 cells long, 5 cells tall. I bought 20, cycled them a few times, measured their capacities and used the 10 highest ones.
This took like one to two weeks.

Stack measures 16" x 6" x 1.8"

You can't really solder to the packs or I don't recommend it. You need some "bus bar" clamps to hold the series together. I have other pictures of it on my thread. https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/ontario-canada-trampa-diy/100855?u=fallen

Just be careful with the batteries because they have more than enough amps to instantly kill you or anything else that accidentally shorts them

Yes.  They are GREAT CELLS!!   I prefer the HP Headways 38120's because no LIPO but Lipo4 and has that better chemistry with very similar specs...

I've seen these on youtube by jehu battery guy. He made an electric skateboard with it too. Wonder if a typical vesc can handle all that discharge current. Theoretically, I could just spend less than $50 and get good range. Crazy. 
I also notice that on the website it said li-ion but on the video review they all said lipo. :thinking:

I have run a single VESC 6.6 at 120 motor amps using one of these bad boys-https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B073V2YJPT/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o08_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1. Even when it is hot outside, the VESC temperature has yet to exceed 45c. To control the motor temperature, you can install another fan on the side of the motor facing into the windings.

If you buy those 200a lipo cells, don't forget to install lipo alarms and buy a good balancing charger because the voltage on the older cells will drop quicker than the newer cells.

From what I read, typical bms will only balance charge when the cells are almost fully charge. So it makes sense to get a high quality balancer for these cells. I'll stick with li-ion :upside_down_face:

Most balance chargers will be able to measure internal impedance, so all you need to do is check each cell. I had access to a function generator and a bunch of other fancy tools so I properly measured all my cells impedance and just cherry picked the packs I built out of the spim08hp packs. Even the difference of 5mohms  isn't that bad ,may result in my one cell being at 3.2 when I cut it off compared to the others at 3.4-3.5 but when you consider the price for 42 of those cells compared to 2 store bought 6s lipos of similar size you can't beat it. I will admit I've kill 2 single cells in my packs but that was more my fault than the batteries

Unless you plan a 4wd drawing 360a continuous amps discharge, I wouldn't use those cells.

At 12p, you can afford to use cheaper lower continuous discharge cells.  
Or similar cost cells with bigger than 4000mah capacity at a lower discharge rate.

You can probably look into those newer 26800 sized cells too.
