This is likely to be a short one, as I know the 'correct' answer is probably going to be speed cream as the standard choice, or some variant of grease as the cheaper option. Not that speed cream is actually that expensive. 

However, I don't currently have any speed cream. What I do have though, is a big can of ACF50, which I use quite often on various things as it's really useful stuff. 

So as I already have it, I was curious whether anyone had used it on bearings? I guess I could try it myself, but I would rather not wreck anything with a bad idea haha

Check the mfq data sheet, it will usually list what the product can be used on/for. Worst comes to worst, try it on some cheapo red bearings and see what happens.

Pretty sure it’s not designed for high speed applications, it’s beauty is stopping corrosion 

Then again better than nothing

ACF50 is an anti corrosion product and not grease.  Thats like spraying wd40 on your bearings and wondering why they don't last very long.  Great for freeing up locked stuff but not so good for providing lubrication.  Get some grease from your local car shop and pack that in there.  Especially if its ....wait for it......wheel bearing grease.  I'm here all week.  :sunglasses:

Bacon grease is the best lube you will find for bearings

WD40 is a different thing again, as that doesn't really have any long term lubricating properties. ACF50 protects and lubricates for 12-18 months per standard application. Very different properties. 

However as @banjaxxed said, it's not designed for high speed applications. They have an actual grease for that. But I don't have that, only the spray. 

So it seems that it'll be better than nothing, much like using a low weight oil, but actual grease would be better. So I might as well pick up some speed cream, or some bacon.

Its an anti corrosion lubricant not a grease.  Its for stopping rust and salt damage.  I use it all the time.  Just not as a bearing lube.  WD40 can also be used as an anti corrosion lubricant hence the analogy.
Don't be fooled by the word lubricant.
