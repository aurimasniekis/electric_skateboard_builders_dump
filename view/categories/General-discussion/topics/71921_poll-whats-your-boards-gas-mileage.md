Let's find out what our real world energy consumption is actually like. These numbers should reflect the all-in consumption, including regeneration. Please only vote if you have actual data (i.e. from a data logging app, or if you sit down and calculate the numbers), don't just guess.  If you have multiple boards with different consumption rates, feel free to vote multiple times, once for each board.

(Watt_hours_consumed - Watt_hours_regenerated) / Distance_travelled

For me, I am 208 lbs and commute around a very hilly area so my current is probably relatively high, but between poor road quality and on a short 30" deck, my speeds are probably low enough to make up for it somewhat.  I average 160 Wh consumed and 41 Wh charged per 10 miles, for (160 Wh - 41 Wh) / 10 mi = 11.9 Wh/mile
