I posted this on social media, but some of you donâ€™t have Facebook.... this is for you guys

Contributing to the Esk8 community comes in many forms. In the case of @nmagz3 & Tishawn, their contributions have  been immense the past few years.

Both have very different channels with different styles, but the goal has been the same. Spread the electric shred.  

Their channels support the activity what we all love, by promoting esk8 in a positive light.  I hope you take a moment to support them, by checking out their videos on YouTube, smashing the like button, commenting, following them and sharing their videos you like.

I believe they are becoming the cornerstone of Esk8 Media. This is how it all begins. 

Support them and they will keep supporting us.

After seeing all the Esk8 apparel, I think I need to change my wardrobe. All I have is my original Esk8SquadOC shirt and the one Renegade shirt.

@Michaelinvegas can you see if there's any way to get LazyRoller, RideThatThing, KalyNYC (@Kaly) , NYC eboarding, BAESK8 (@sofu) shirt designs onto spreadshirts https://shop.spreadshirt.com/esk8squad so those who are interested can purchase them?

I did not design those shirts. The logo and shirts were @Jinraâ€™s doing, as is the group in general tbh. I just help run it!

i did set up a website though if you want to buy one. http://baesk8.club

Got to meet Tishawn at an NYC ride and he is one crazy badass motherf***** flying around on that unicycle while getting the perfect shot truly insane.

Saw the videos of a couple of races he (I mean tishawn with the unicycle) was filming. That must be really infuriating to be racing full throttle while a dude is casually riding looking backwards with his camera ahead of you.

Met tishawn in NYC last year. Dude is the truth. Actually most NYC esk8 crew is chill as hell.  But him in Miami filming and Shaq, aka @Battosaii rolling 40mph towering over everyone on film....cant wait for that shit to happen.

This is true, though we're still in the planning stage. Its gonna be a combined trip by DC, NYC and Boston. We're still debating if we should drive down there or fly :man_shrugging:
