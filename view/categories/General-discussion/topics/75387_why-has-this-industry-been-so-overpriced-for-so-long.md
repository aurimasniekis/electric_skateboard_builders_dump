Not to be rude and im not here to start fights but discussion on Why has this industry been so overpriced for so long? Why are people just accepting this? We spend nearly as much on Eboard wheels as you do for your tires on your car and that's just one example. Its not only our parts market but complete boards in general priced at not much less than a quality used car.. 



Also in a industry that's already WAY overpriced, Those offering a pathetic 15-20% off in the esk8 world is a piss take and any 'savings' from that is basically nothing... Look around at black friday deals and in general sectors (electronics, tools, tec) and you see far bigger discounts..

Over priced? Have you ever been to bicycle store?

Listen things are expensive because we are at the bleeding edge of technology and we're standing on them at 30+mph, any failure is very serious and can cost you way more than that shiny part you thought was too expensive.

Ok, so I don't want to be rude or anything but anyone who even has the slightest bit of knowledge about economic will easily understand what's going on here.
For example @Hummie  hubs:
A big company like Samsung has huge factories with assembly lines trained workers and so on. They can produce in large quantities relatively cheap. Because the also have to buy parts but they can order them in large quantities so that's also cheap.
On the other hand, a guy like @Hummie has a small production with small quantities and has to put a lot of work into it... So that makes it obviously more expensive. He also orders parts in a small quantitys so that's make's it even more expensive.

Just my opinion :smile:
@Hummie sorry if I got anything wrong...

Ok, so first of all, if you want to talk about prices, it's roughly £60 and not £50 as you've mentioned. 4 fitted tires at that store are £232 which is around 300 USD and a similar quality E-skate wheel set will cost you about $60 shipped. Now, these tires are manufactured in quantities of hundreds of thousands wheres PU wheels are made specifically for this ***NICHE*** market in quantities of a few hundreds, rarely a couple thousands.

Btw, notice that word ***Niche***, usually has a big affect on pricing 😄

@davewood1982 You literally answered your own question.  I would suggest thinking for maybe 30 seconds before making a thought like that public.  

-------

I want to take this opportunity to educate folks on neat concept...

1.  An opinion has no inherent value.  If its stupid, saying 'just my opinion' is meaningless.
2.  You DO NOT have the right to an opinion that is disproven by facts,  No one is attacking you when they say "an opinion is stupid", they are simply stating 'their' opinion.
3.  Falling into the trap that you 'deserve' to have your own opinion on any given subject is nothing more than a recipe for life long stupidity and unhappiness.

Wait… Where is my opinion disproven by facts. I was just trying to explain why I think it is justified that eskate parts are expensive in comparison to a tv for example. Furthermore, I think everyone deserves an opinion just because they have one doesn’t mean that the opinion is right or proven…
[/quote]

Nobody deserves anything.  You must earn stuff.  Facts are irrefutable.  If a fact collides with your opinion, then your opinion is wrong.

Example:

*I think that thing is pretty.*  :arrow_backward: This is an opinion.  It's neither provable nor disprovable.

*I think the Earth is flat.* :arrow_backward: This is contradicted by proven facts and you are not entitled to this opinion.  It's not a fuzzy subject.  You either take advice and update your thoughts based on proven facts, or you are an idiot that does not deserve the gift of other folks' valuable time.  You don't "deserve" an opinion.

You mention mounts being overpriced...

I tried to get a short run of firefly remote mechanical parts laser cut from aluminium. I was quoted the equivalent of over 100USD for ONE set. Discount for bulk? Maybe if I was ordering more than 10 sets.

And that was from the first engineering firm that didn’t laugh me out of their office.

So if mounts are overpriced, it’s not because the designer is charging too much. It’s because Joe down at McWilliams engineering could be using his machine to cut out a $1000 shop sign in the time it would take him to cut your 10 motor mounts. And in case you’re wondering, Joe thinks your hobby is kinda stupid. He doesn’t care if your mounts are overpriced, because he doesn’t care if your mounts get made at all.

David, mate. Keeping it real simple.

If you think about it logically all of the industries you've mentioned are extremely well established, 30+ years of manufacture on gigantic scales bring costs down to the absolute minimum. Not to mention 30+ years of bribery, manipulation, ecological damage and atrocities, political manipulation and the list just goes on and on.

Their margins are huge on most of their products and the ones with low margins, driven down by competition make it up elsewhere. Like you buy a watch for £60 but the spare straps are £30. That watch seems like a great deal but if you break the strap you get economic anal and you have no choice but to accept it.

On the other end of the scale we have esk8 - and skating in general. It's always been a fringe hobby/sport. Yeah there are high earners and some companies are well established but Samsung has a market capacity of literally billions of customers and they are producing a million plus products a day. 

Flipsky are producing 10s to 100s of products a day and their market is likely a few thousand people at most. Their margins are not exactly stellar to start with but are also whittled down by the bureaucracy of paypal claims, damaged on arrival products, poor R&D that's lead to problems with early models and loads of returns. By the time they've sorted all that and the administration involved with dealing with it - because time is money and time requires staff - they've made just enough to consider this viable. That's an example of a larger producer appealing to a wider audience.

Our local builders, who put their soul, life and effort into a single board for sale with margins that (no offence chaps) would make most entrepreneurs run for the hills, are not doing this for the big bucks and a ticket to the high life. They are passionate, these products exist because passionate people were willing to give up substantial portions of their lives to make it possible.

So when you pop on here and make a really poorly thought out post with no research or basic logic you offend them, and all the rest of us who can put two and two together.

If you're young, that's cool, we all need to learn. If you're older - do some reading mate, you look like a tit.

The part are so expensive because it is a specialty market you dont have thousands of people buying an item or major companies in the field.  Its not like samsung or sony are putting out electric skateboards.  Most of the companies are 1 or 2 people enertion is probably the biggest company in eboarding that are strictly eboards.

To answer OP, I accept this because you're right- parts are expensive, the quality stuff at least. Why? This has been answered.

Personally I'd love if quality parts were cheaper. How can we help make this happen? Dunno.

I guess if I can save 20% at some point that's better than nothing.

I will say, I respect hummie for trying to sell quality parts at cost. Those decks of his? God damn that's cheap for what you get compared to the rest of the industry... But we can't expect businesses to do all their business at cost like a single dude can out of pure love of the sport and wanting to spread kick-ass gear just breaking even.

When you design an item, that costs money. In pharma you call that R&D. When you sell 4 items, you have to mark up each individual item to make up for the design costs. When you sell 4 billion, you have to mark each item up 1billionth of what you would if you were only selling four items.

As for sales figures, we know that there are a lot fewer people who own boards then, as OP mentioned, own TVs. (229 million TVs sold last year, vs a hugely generous estimate of 2.9 million eBoards. Do the math)

We can't give you the scale because nobody here has access to the sales figures. We just understand the basic concept that when you sell more of something, each one costs less. Hence, TV parts will be comparatively cheaper than eboard parts because they sell 229 million TVs, and they don't even sell 2.9 million eboards!

1. While @davewood1982 's wheel example isn't one I've ever seen, I do think that the overall question is 
    valid. If anyone has concrete examples (with evidence!) let's see them, compare and debate.  
2. I'm pretty sure that most of this stuff is covered in @onloop 's false economy article:

3. People are always finding new ways to make things on their own for cheaper, and usually then someone 
    finds a way to do it better, and offer it to the community.
    A year ago we didn't have angled risers, remotes with telemetry, an open source 3D printed gear drive(!!).
    Now we have all that and more, you can either make it yourself, buy a kit, or a ready to use one. Your 
    choice.  
4. Since most everyone here built their ride from scratch rather than buying, I think "expensive" is a little bit 
    subjective here, because it depends on what you want to build and what you're willing to invest.
    If you want a dual-motor deluxe offroad machine - well of course it'll be more expensive than a single-motor 
    commuter board to travel over flat pavement!

Decide what you want and what you're willing to pay for. Not everyone here buys gear drives and a pair of vesc 6, yet they still manage to create some powerful boards. Some of us 3D print our own enclosures, covers, even pulleys. My first board is using a $30 moose deck I got on ebay, and it works just fine FOR ME.
The point is, there's always prohibitively expensive stuff, mid-range stuff, dirt cheap, and everything in between.

Yeah, but why is that important?  He made a hypothesis based on zero information.  He actually cited common sense as why 'knows' something.  That certainly doesn't prove the hypothesis.  I can  say for a fact that ABEC does NOT make a massive profit on flywheels, @davewood1982 "knows" it though despite the complete lack of evidence...

The numbers are irrelevant, the theory is what matters. We just need to know that there are vastly more TVs sold then electric skateboards, which is why components are comparatively cheaper.

Prices go down in niche industries as they grow, because more people are buying hence more is made hence lower overall prices.

I can say for a fact because I know people that work at ABEC, I know what the material cost is for skateboard wheels and flywheels specifically.  

I'm not offering you proof because I didn't make the hypothesis, the burden of proof remains on the person that makes a hypothesis.  I'm also not offering you proof because its privileged, and frankly you have no need for and don't deserve the information.

seriously, what I have done is irrelevant to this discussion.  What I see as the important points is as follows...

**1.  The industry is overpriced**
Where's the proof?  There isn't any and wont be any because the statement is false.  It will remain false until someone offers proof, which won't happen as the proof does not exist as the initial claim is STUPID AS SHIT!

**2.  ABEC makes an unreasonable profit**
I know this to be incorrect, I will NOT offer proof asn it is not my burden because I didn't make the claim.  The proof was posted in the last few days, do some damned research on a topic before you jump waste deep into something you don't know about.

**3.  @mmaner is a liar**
Hell, maybe I am.  Maybe your all just figments of my imagination and I'm really in a mental ward somewhere dreaming all this crap.  If that's case I really need to move on to some hawaiian lovelys with no tops :slight_smile:.

"Ripping people off" is subjective.  They're priced in a manner that allows them to sell and make a profit.  They're not publicly traded (that I am aware) and have no obligation to release sales information.  As far as in economies of scale, we don't know how large the industry is but it is a given that it is much, much smaller than other industries that OP compared.  Confoundingly, parts are niche since this is still in it's infancy and mass production has not completely taken off (@onloop and others are changing this). People who are running these businesses need to make a profit in order to continue, so yes, margins may well be high.  As the industry grows competition will increase, factories and manufacturers will be better tooled for Mass production, and prices will fall.

Please stop arguing semantics.

It's simply a matter of the introduction of highly skilled riders in electric skateboarding. They want boards and parts that can handle high loads and perform with precision. Precise parts are usually very difficult to gain any cost savings when making them at scale. Same goes for exotic materials, buying them at scale rarely equates to any huge savings. 

I'm always baffled by the motivation to make post like this in this market. Do people pull this crap in a lambo forum? Or what about a cycling forum? High end bikes are way more expensive now than they were 20 years ago.

Economy of scale =/= speculation. You simply don't understand the concept. It's something that applies in all free market economies without subsidies, (i.e. eskate) I don't need to prove it any more than I need to prove that the wind blows.

I made no claim, simplys said the claim, which you have been defending, is false and made the statement that the proof exists.  I then pointed you to the proof.  Now come on little tax burden, we know you can do it, go read that topic :slight_smile:

That's just the tip of the iceberg as far as what your not understanding.  I did NOT make the claim, I disputed the claim and offered proof, your just too lazy to go read it.  Even if I didn't offer proof, it wouldn't matter as lack of evidence doesn't prove or disprove.  Did you say something like earlier?

I can't catch up to this thread if I tried, it's moving to fast. But IMO, the reason things are over priced is because  people innovating need to take large amounts of their day working on stuff, replacing part of or completely a paying job. Especially machining, is expensive. In the case of hummie hubs, the materials used are not cheap. Everything is well over spec to ensure things don't break. Each motor at this point is over $200 is raw materials, and then wheels and custom trucks on top of that... If we replaced bearings with cheap ones, reduced magnet strength and quality, and used cheap epoxies instead of specific glues engineered for motor winding's and specific glue for magnets in motors, I bet the motor cost could get down to $100 each. But then your just increasing the problems your customers could experience. Better to build something with quality, even if it costs more...

Unless you own your own factory, this is the limit on e skate innovators.

Come on Dave, everyone knows it is cheap AF to design, test, and have custom parts machined and produced for 10s to 100s of parts sold.

Especially in the US.

You should be paying the consumer.

It’s not overpriced. If ppl like Chris Chaput or psychotiller or longhairedboy only cared about profits, they would be in a different industry. These guys are in the esk8 industry because it’s their PASSION. As a customer it’s always easy to bitch and moan about price. These guys aren’t particularly rich. They make enough money for a living and that’s it. They are doing this because they love it and they love the community, and I guarantee you they aren’t ripping you off.

Ok I think we have seen all that is needed to see, a man who makes claims that he can't support, then lies about where the "proof" is to deflect the point and a hoard of followers that will happily insult anyone who doesn't agree with their grand leader. Sounds like a cult to me.

Haha true. Any specialized hobby is expensive. That’s the way it is. I remember back when I built quadcopters how much of a money pit it was. But I wasn’t paying some baron who was making millions, I was paying some smart engineer who made some component in their garage. Then places like banggood started copying the hobbyists designs and it became much cheaper. But you weren’t paying for innovation, you were paying a huge Chinese company to copy innovative designs.

I never look both ways, I typically don't even look forward, which is likely why I've had so many concussions :slight_smile:.

This thread is a whole load of sad. Just to anyone reading. Don't believe everything mmaner says, from what I have heard, he makes claims without proof, and resorts to name calling to protect his ego. And Im guessing he will just use his powers to shut me up and great, I wont have to listen to his lies anymore. Thanks bois Im gonna play smash bros.

When prices come down, profit margins shrink. Yes, you finally figured something out. Good work. When I said retail price I meant price its sold for, and profit margin is difference between cost of making it/buying it and what it was sold for.

It's amazing, even in this digital age where people have rescources at their finger tips people still make baseless claims. It takes a few clicks to realize how much it costs to get time on a machine's such as cnc's mills, water jet cutters let alone the labor for them. ESPECIALLY IN THE US. Even when vendors are ordering from China people don't realize the time it takes to deal with those factories. Often they speak broken English and the time and effort it takes would make most poeple go insane. I have the upmost rescpecy for people like @psychotiller and I will keep giving them my money. You can choose to spend your money however you like, nobody is forcing you.

II’m sure this thread will be deleted shortly so I’m probably wasting my time.

But I genuinely think the answer to your question might be for you to try designing a motor mount. Then work out how to manufacture that mount and you will soon understand about esk8 prices. It’s possible that designers/vendors are paying too much for manufacturing. 

But then probably not... most engineering outfits I’ve spoke to had too much work on. An esk8 vendor is not doing the manufacturer a favour by giving them business. The vendor has to pay them an amount that makes it worth their while to put down whatever other job they are doing and do a run of 100 motor mounts.

As for @Fissh02’s requests for a definition or proof of “scale” in the context of the esk8 industry...

Would you agree that the esk8 industry is significantly smaller than the car industry or television industry? I’m reading that most people in this thread agree with that hypothesis. This is the basis of the economies of scale explanation for esk8 prices.

If you don’t agree with that hypothesis... two things:

1) that’s the fundamental divergence in view here. Apparently most people here think that is a fairly safe assumption, even an observable fact. Nobody is making any claims about the precise degree to which the esk8 industry is smaller in scale than those other industries (there was a rough estimate of 1000 times smaller I think?) I think the assumption is probably based on local observations of how many people own a car or tv vs how many people own an esk8, prominence of marketing for automobile and tv industries, number of retail outlets specialising in automobile and tv sales vs retail outlets specialising in esk8... etc etc. 

2) Wow. Good luck with your reality comprehension goals in 2019.

Every product that is in a retail store is made at way way less then you buy it for. You pay for the convenience, warranty and after sales service. Also you don't need to fly to china to find it in some crazy market.  Most industries there is 4x to 8x  markup from actual cost to manufacture. 

A factory can make something for $10, they sell it to the company that ordered it for $20, that company can then sell it to a retailer for $40, then the retailer can sell it for $80. 

That’s 8x the original cost to make it. This is normal. However shocking.

While most esk8 suppliers are making way less margin because they are selling direct without retail and because they can not charge a huge margin or people would not buy it. 

If esk8 companies where making huge margin they would be able to afford to have 50% off black fridays and still have enough profit left to keep the lights on, but fact is they don't. 

This thread is so dumb.

Ohh yeah everything in esk8 is really expensive to my budget, but I don't think anyone is charging unreasonable prices. Most companies are barely profitable.

Liar. 

You implied the threat by saying you are collecting IP addresses and evidence. Which is another blayrnt lie as you don't have api access or gateway access, so you can't get to the access logs to get IP addresses. 

Oh, and evidence of what?  That your an idiot. Dude, theres 200 people right here that will testify to that.
