Hey guys,

Who sells custom and pre-built boards within the EU (to avoid the crazy import costs and Tax)

While in the UK we can get the following;
**boosted stealth** for ¬£1500 from skatehut
or the **bamboo GT street** for ¬£1180 from skatehut
the **Lacroix DSS60** for about ¬£2600 once shipping and Tax included
a **Kaly.NYC** if you can get one would be around ¬£2500-¬£3000 imported
I dont like the **metroboard** design (high deck, very low motor mounts, diagonal motors)



So i have tried to compile a list of current UK and EU builders of DIY Custom baords.
Please add any that i have not found or appear to be a quality product.

Maybe the Bioboards builds from @mackann should be on this list as well. A few weeks till they'll be up for sale I believe.

Hey Trampa,

Honestly the only thing that has made me discount these is that the boards are not sold complete.

And for some crazy reason you dont offer a streetcarver/urban carver with an underdeck battery and ESC enclosure. Is this something you might offer at some point?

He sells underboard battery trays.
Or as min one.
http://www.trampaboards.com/under-board-battery-trays--c-1029.html

And you can find here many others which can make you an enclosure for the carve deck too.


Ah, and it helps to tag @trampa because if no he will probably don‚Äôt see it üòâ

if im not mistaken they are rigid trays for the longboards and not the carver boards.

But I know im not the only person who would prefer to buy prebuilt and if a company is giving me a half built board i might as well go full DIY and save $500

I love the Streetcarver but i want one prebuilt with an underbaord tray which is why i have not included trampa (as amazing as the products are)

Probably yes. I'm not so convinced about the currently available solutions so we bang on something smarter.

You can make this tray flexy by adding cuts.
Frank wrote a how todo here.
But they don‚Äôt do batteries, so you would need to take that part into your own hand or buy from somebody else.

I might be able to help you out. I do a range of enclosures for the landyachtz decks and others. I have the hummie decks on their way and do a range of different enclosures for them too.

There is also Scramboards.com (uk based). But be carefull with them...
Their 12s6p and 12s4p for instance are advertised incorectly. I already have told them at least twice but they didn't change it.
the Battery's mah ....Also the price is rather competitive for a 12s6p 30Q

https://www.scramboards.com/parts/12s-6p-30-q-samsung-battery.html

I've ordered a 12s6p a few weeks ago and asked to have Samsung 30q cells like they advertise on their site. First they told me it was ok. They even proposed to give me one of their battery boxes for free... 

**1st mail:**
_It will be 30Q Samsung battery rest assured._

_We cannot be sure if can fit your box. But we will supply a box with the battery so you can order either 4p or 6p._

_Yes we will start production as soon as you place order so can finish usually within 10 days._

_You can order via the website either 4p or 6p._

**mail i received 8 days after they have recieved my payment and had already confirmed multiple times it was ok:**

_With regard to your battery order the price we charged we will make a loss so we cannot produce for this price. The exchange rate of the ¬£ and all our costs have gone up recently this order also include extra parts. The shipping cost is also over ¬£120 as it is large battery._ 

we _would need to charge another ¬£100 we appreciate if this is not acceptable but it's the only way._ 

**Result:** i still haven't got any battery and lost a few weeks because of the refund that was ongoing , the fact that i had to find another battery builder etc... 

So i learned that :
Scramboards only delivers 30Q if you clearly ask it (even though they clearly mention that their battery is made out of 30Q cells ,which isn't true at all).

The information they provide via chat and phone is totally different

The positive note is that they refunded quickly but on the other hand the refund was held by Paypal for about a week.
