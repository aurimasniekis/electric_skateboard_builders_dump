Hi guys,

I am fairly new to the Electric Skateboarding community, but this year I have been planning on creating an electric longboard. I have created a parts list for the build itself, but I have some questions regarding it. 

One of my main concerns is that I am planning on using a "Drop Through Deck" with Hub motors. Is this a good idea or will there not be enough room when between the deck and the motors. The HUB motors im planning on using are http://www.diyeboard.com/replaceable-pu-dual-hub-motor-9055mm-500w2-power-truck-kit-p-671.html?zenid=mk03u39i510irl3h69leird5m4 those one theres there. The deck I am planning on using is the https://www.skateshred.com/39-x-9-5-canadian-maple-through-double-kick-blank-deck.html .

My second concern is if the battery, ESC, and hub motors are all compatible as I do not want to order in all the parts and find that parts are not compatible so they do not work at the best of their ability or at all. The battery I was planning on using was the https://www.ebay.com/itm/Taotuo-6s-10000mAh-22-2V-6S1P-30C-LIPO-Battery-Pack-XT60-Plug-For-RC-Helicopter-/362486435503?oid=221559238493 and for the ESC the https://www.ebay.com/itm/Dual-motors-longboard-skateboard-controller-with-remote-ESC-Substitute/302812941839?hash=item46810ece0f:m:mEjYlp9id5UtRAwhPmlchiw:rk:1:pf:1&frcectupt=true .

I am trying to keep this build fairly cheap but is there better parts that I could be using for around the same price?

Thanks guys for giving me some help, appriciate it alot.

Yes, better parts are buying a generic Asian board. It will be cheaper, better, have some warranty and customer support. If you are not happy with it, just swap the deck to your liking. 
BTW, don't buy from DIYboard, they are not trusted.

It does need to be a DIY board though as im doing it for a project through school. Do you have any parts that you could recommend for me that would be better than the parts listed here?

A project through school? Do you have a machine shop available to you then?
