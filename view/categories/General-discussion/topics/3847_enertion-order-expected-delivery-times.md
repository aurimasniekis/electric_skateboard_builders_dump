Hi Everyone,

We have experienced 1400% growth in the past 4 months, which is great. We are really excited by this growth, however; this has put immense pressure on our supply chain so we are working rapidly to scale the business in line with this growth.  We do appreciate your patience over the past little while and want to let everyone know that we have put on one full-time person already and are interviewing to put on another person dedicated to order packing and shipping. 

We are working toward providing the best customer service possible to you guys and expect you will see many positive changes in next few weeks. Just so you know, at the moment - for every order that we pack each day, there are more than double the amount of orders coming in which is really good for growth but not so good for people waiting on deliveries.

Here is a brief update of our schedule and order fulfilment over the coming month:

**VESC Delivery Schedule**
This week 100 VESC orders will ship. This will take us to order # 2227.
Next week 100 VESC orders will ship. This will take us to order # 2474
The following week the next 100 VESC orders will ship. This will take us to order # 2721
Again, the following week another 100 VESC orders will ship. This will take us to order # 2919
We anticipate that after this backlog has cleared out of our system, we will be back to a few days turn-around for new orders.

**RAPTOR Delivery Schedule**
**The following Raptor orders will be shipping in next 7 days**
Raptor orders up to 2686

**The following Raptor orders will be shipping in approx 14 days (pending safe arrival of VESC)**
Raptor orders up to 3081

**Raptors shipping 2nd half JUNE (pending VESC)**
Raptor orders up to 3358

**RAPTORS SHIPPING LATE JUNE - EARLY JULY**
Raptor orders up to 3777

**Space Cell Pro3 & Pro4**
These orders will start shipping to our US distributor after June 10. European and Australian customers will have their orders shipped directly from our battery factory starting June 10. This can take between 10- 14 days shipping to arrive.

completed- no assembly required for the space cell pro's other than mounting on your board.

Hi @EnertionSupport , I live in Argentina (South America) and I placed my order for a SPACE Cell Pro3 the 18th of April 2016, when are they shipping? Since I dont live in the US.

Thanks!

@EnertionSupport, my order number is #2045.
As you said you'd be shipping 100 VESCs till order number #2227 last week.
Does this mean order 2127 till 2227 ?

Since my order's status did not change into shipping i'm wondering if you forgot about me ?

Regards

@ikjahaa  The vesc's they received, the led's were put on backwards, so they sent them back to the manufacturer.

He's not kidding, there is a delay.   I heard seven days, but I'm just not sure if that will be the case.   I think it will be long there personally.  Don't hold your breath.  

Also if you email them it says it will take 7-14 days for a reply because they are behind.  However someone got a generic reply earlier than that.

All the vesc we got in the first batch had the LED on backwards, so they got sent back to US to be reworked, they will be distapatched from US, but the VESC for raptors will need to be sent back to Australia. 5-7 days worth of delays due to shipping to USA & Then Back To AUS

The raptor batteries for US customers shipped from my factory 3 weeks ago, normally takes 3-4 days of transit time, they are somewhere in US & have been for the last 2 weeks, for some unknown reason they have not arrived at distributor. As soon as the US distributor gets them they will be dispatched, i have been told they will get them soon.

We won't be shipping batteries into US with that method anymore.

I can assure you all that we build & ship everything ASAP... we are not sitting here twiddling our thumbs...

We are now getting between 100-200 emails every day mostly stupid questions about what hobby motor & what lipo to buy... this means that we can't always answer the important emails sent from our paying customers because we can only answer about 40-50 emails each day.

I have now employed 3 new staff to keep up with demand, i have been working my arse off to train them and develop better systems so we can scale with the huge growth. New staff normally take about 2-4 weeks to warm up before they actually start reducing the work load.

Please try to be patient we are working as fast & as hard as possible. If you have an urgent email please reply to us & say your email is urgent & we will jump onto it.

I suppose having the worlds fastest production skateboard makes you popular....

The delay in shipping is due to complications with the old manufacturers ( hense why they were fired)  dont worry. I know waiting is hard but your just going to have to.you will get your product eventually.

it has another topic discussing about this, which has been closed since last week. 
it is against the forumÂ´s rules this kind of "comment". if you have some problem with the vendor you have to resolve directly with the vendor. the forum is more for technical specs, doubts etc

just adding: i am in the same boat with you... awaiting fulfillment as well...
