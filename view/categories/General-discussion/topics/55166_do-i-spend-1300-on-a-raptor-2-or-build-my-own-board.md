Im thinking about this as I have the chance to buy a raptor 2 at $1300 I've seen them sell from the $1500-1700 range and I think that $1300 is a steal (if it isnt let me know). I also am thinking of DIYing really hard (been making parts list and talking to people on here for parts). Not sure which way to lean as both are good.

For that price you can build a sweet board.  Or don't and just ride

Build your own. I have my DIY that's been running for almost two years with little to no problems. My Raptor 2 has had so many problems that I've barely been able to ride it.

Is the Raptor 2 BNIB?
Do you have experience riding direct drive? 
Does the 1 warranty  transfer over? Or what happens if a part doesnâ€™t work?

If you did DIY, do you have someone FTF that can assist if needed? My friend helped me. Parts and deck was ~$1500. However, because of my original setup and the roads I ride, I broke several motor magnets. I fried one VESC when riding single motor with dual setup ðŸ™ˆ. All of that cost more. 

Personally, I have not tried the Raptor 2 but it sounds like a good deal BNIB.

No experience direct drive been riding a Boosted for 3 years now.

The warranty does transfer, and are you referring to like manufacture defect of buying it from the dude

Neither.  You buy a Metroboard or build your own board.  Don't buy hub motor stuff.

Have you looked into Marbel board they're belt motor. Plus they have slick looking design. Metroboard imo has the old school big box design. Not trying to offend any Metroboard owners out there.

 GT2B remote Is super reliable Carvon sells a 50mph awd board with that remote in a mod case.
as for the Nano X, Well it looks a lot like the bad rep winning remote.

and well The GT2B I think! has more travel than the nano, Giving you more control over the throttle and brake,

Gotcha, think I might sub out the Nano X for it then I don't want to mess around with reliability

...buy your own board.... for the same reason you don't see Inboard M1s, Acton Quattros, or Lou Boards around here.

I have the Raptor 2, I'm having issues like everyone does, but support has been great and solving all of them (slowly) I couldn't ride it as much as a like, but it is a really great product, I'm coming from diy dual belts and I really hope I not need to go back to them. Power wise is great and the riding experience is really good. I'm again waiting and not riding which is shit, honestly, but I think when everything is nailed is going to be like endless ride and fun, almost no maintenance, no need it to open it to tweak anything, no belt adjustment, no motor moving, no stones in the pulleys, etc,etc.. in the end I would buy it again. Just hoping all problems they are facing got solved quickly.

I spent about $1300 on my DIY and it's a beast it's my favorite board so much so that when my long awaited Raptor 2 arrived it feels lacking, it doesn't give me that adrenaline rush I get on my diy.

Dont get me wrong the Raptor 2 is a fast board and it's very smooth and quite I like it alot I feel that it is an Improvment over the Raptor 1 but i like my DIY and my Raptor 1 better. 

Most people will be happy with a Raptor 2 once they fix this urethane problem, I'm happy with the board though.

My Pho3nix is way faster and heart pumping than my Raptor, I'm. Not sure if I got used to it but pulling the throttle all the way down does not makes me fall back at all.
