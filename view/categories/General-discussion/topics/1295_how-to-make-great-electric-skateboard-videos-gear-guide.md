You might want to avoid shooting video vertically. It is generally frowned upon and by many -including myself-  considered a breach of good etiquette.

I use Adobe Creative Cloud...mostly Premiere and Magic Bullet. Actually I had someone ask me if it's a wheelie or a manual. From my understanding if you throttle into the wheelie, let throttle go and balance while coasting, that's technically a manual which is what we did. Not sure if this specific to hub motors because of the coasting ability. Maybe someone else can weigh in on this.

creative cloud rules! Mine was done rather quickly in Premier CC outputting through Encoder, but i've used After Effects extensively for other things like the music video i finally finished late last year. I've heard a lot of good things about the Magic Bullet suite though. But i'm wondering how much of its polish can also be done with standard premier tools and gradient overlays. 

maybe i should step up my game a little next time and see what i can get out of it :smile: 

What blows my mind these days is what you can get out of a phone camera and what CC can do with it.

Yup Magic Bullet is good for quick and dirty color grades. A lot of the looks in there could definitely be duplicated with the Lumetri tools in Premiere but I find that applying an extreme look and dialing back is more intuitive to me than starting at a neutral point. Outside of narrative or commercial projects, I go pretty heavy on filters with everything else. Speaking of phone cams, I just got this sweet 18mm Z-Prime lens for my iPhone 6 which should be awesome to test out on the next ride. Kill two birds...

i noticed you posted something about that on instagram. I got some cheap crappy lenses from geek.com super cheap a while back and plan on playing with those, but i'm definitely interested in getting some decent ones like what you got. The 6+ shoots crazy good video for what it is, but good lensing can really make a mood.

Absolutely, I'd also highly recommend a handheld gimbal, like an [Ikan Fly X-3][1], it does a lot for smoothing out the shots and combined with the iPhone's internal stabilization, makes it buttery smooth.

On the subject of iPhone lenses, I got one of those [Optrix Waterproof cases][1] recently, it comes with a 4-lense kit and I added another fisheye for skate shots. It can be mounted on a monopod/handle for action photography. A totally decent piece of kit.

@trbt555 @longhairedboy also recently picked up one of these...basically a painter's pole adapter with a 1/4-20 thread. Painter poles are super cheap at Home Depot and can extend super far for some really interesting action/booming shots. We have may to split this thread into DIY video techniques next lol

one cool thing about using iphones as cameras other than the excellent video they take that is always handily available in your pocket is the fact that their lenses are entirely on one side of the device. And small. 

That means you can do things like duct/gaffer tape them to sticks, microphone booms, tree branches, road signs, just about anything without obstructing the lens. 

several of the shots in my video were taken while my wallet-case was being used to drape the phone over a 15mph speed limit sign, fiber optic pole, tree branch, and a few other dirty tricky things i used in the field since i didn't think to bring a tripod. 

i don't see why this thread can't be used to talk about our video techniques as well as our videos we're posting, but i'm not the only mod so maybe there are other ideas about that within other mod's brains. 

did i mention my lens was cracked? it produces the most brilliant lens flares now that i don't think I could reproduce otherwise, but it does make golden-hour shots a little trickier when the sun is off to one side and not behind the lens.

I am really interested in this topic at the moment... I personally think that to achieve a mainstream status for the self-built electric skateboard movement it will all come down to amazing videos of us riding. Communication through video is very powerful.

**So how can a beginner make a really awesome video with a limited budget.?**

I think our resident filmmakers @Moja @RunPlayBack are the guys with the most experience to help answer these questions.

**What is the absolute minimum hardware/software/technique to achieve a quality video, one with stable footage. Something that people want to watch & share?**
```

The answer to stable footage is powered Gimbals, you can stick a DSLR on a DJI Ronin or go smaller and get the DJI Osmo which is the smallest gimbal camera to date. Gopro on a stick with a foot head for video is great too. 

 Quality video comes from understanding sequences, composing nice shots, constructing stories and communicating a feeling. The technical side relies on good lenses, large sensors, good codecs, precision composition and stable motion. 

 I'd say get an Osmo with an extended stick, the mic attachment and an Iphone 6. And make sure you are getting all kinds of different angles, movements and locations in your footage. Good editing is about having lots of content to play with to construct your video. Also pick a nice track, nothing worse than great footage to a horrible track. And dont forget to beat match to the music, its as easy as laying markers on the track in the timeline.

Get one and go shred!

Just to add on a cheap option, 80% of my most recent eboard video (with my wood arbor and pocket rocket) was filmed with a gen1 Garmin virb on a go pole.. 

The virb is a gopro competitor by Garmin (very reputable company abviously) but has a $100 price tag: http://www.amazon.com/Garmin-Action-Camera-Discontinued-Manufacturer/dp/B00EOHUVV8

This thing is totally worth the buy.. hell, I have 2 of them, and 1 , the newest version! Color is great, film time is 3+ hours, waterproof, has a LCD display, easy to use.. the list goes on an on. 

On a side note,

 FCP > After Effects  :wink:

@Moja pretty much covered it all, great insight! Just to add to that, the video should evoke an emotion and translate what you were feeling in a visual language. It's a big reason why I go straight into edit once I get home - to capitalize off the lingering adrenaline rush.

I thought this DIY forum which promotes building and designing everything ourselves including things like Vesc, badwolf enclosures, diy Li-ion packs with BMS built in, molds and presses for pressing complex concave boards, molding plastics for enclosures, Carbon fiber build and molds, wheel composites and generally kicking the crap out of more commercial products would have developed or built something already.

For less than 100$ and a bit of soldering build your own go-pro /xiaomi /sjs 
3-axis gimbal. A flashlight with 3 or 4 Li-ion batteries and the programmable brushless gimbal from goodluck buy.com and you are in business. Add a 10$ HK joystick for thumb control and panning. 

Ordered parts a few days ago for this.......

The video isn't me but all the supplies are linked in description. The gimbal is the first version of 32 bit storm 3-axis gimbal. This guy in the video runs this off two Li- ion cells but the gimbal runs on 9-11v so I found a flashlight that runs off 3 Li-ion so it has a longer handle for the gimbal. I'll post a build thread here when I build.

A lot of people are using this Gimbal for GoPro's and Xiaomi Yi's:
[http://www.goodluckbuy.com/3-axis-brushless-gimbal-camera-mount-with-32bit-storm32-controller-for-gopro-3-4-fpv-black.html][1]

I can really recommend using a Storm32 Controller. It is much cheaper as an Alexmos BGC and works really well. It is developed in Germany and the hardware is open source. I am in contact with the developer since the announcement of this great Brushless Gimbal Controller and it is amazing to see the development done the past years. 
Here you can see a video by myself at the very beginning where the firmware wasn't at its point as it is now. (If someone is in to it I beta tested dual IMU support there for the dev :grinning:)
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRuPCPZv4pE][2]
There the controller was self soldered and the hardware self build, but now you can get them really cheap on goodluckbuy.

If someone needs some help on set the Gimbal up I think I can help. Also his website [http://www.olliw.eu/2013/storm32bgc/][3] and his wiki [http://www.olliw.eu/storm32bgc-wiki/Main_Page][4] will help you a lot.

To add to all previous discussion, on the topic of Editing software, I use Sony Vegas Pro 13! I'm still amateur when it comes to cinematography, but it's my career goal for when I'm older. 
Here's one of my videos, Sony Vegas is extremely proficient when it comes to putting together shorts.  
http://youtu.be/1xsrHaH2h2E

As far as stabilization, I use the GlideCam HD1000. Glidecam is a stabilization rig that uses balanced weight to achieve buttery shots, rather than motorized gimbals! (Although these take A LOT of practice to master, the results are amazing once you know how to use it)

Yeah it is brutal but so much fun especially with a group. I see all those Boosted videos of skinny tech hipsters high fiving on the beach and none of those videos speak to me whatsoever. My boys in Detroit and the crew I grew up with in New York identify with cultural convergence and these overproduced silicon valley skate videos love to ignore all of that.

@RunPlayBack those are some slick edits. Very cool. I will be looking into your blog for inspiration/education...


I cut this a while ago, previous build. To stabilize my diy gopro pole mount, I taped a mini sledge-hammer to the handle end and then wrapped grip tape around the balance point. :P Primitive, but effective.

I bought a few cheap items to assist me when filming, RunPlayBack really inspired me into making better movies,
I really like his workflow but i don't have the $$$ for the gimballed accesoires though :P 
So right now i'm plowing through youtube video tutorials on post processing movies. 

Here's the stuff i bought, i will ofcourse use this for things other than eskate video's :smile:

They all come from aliexpress, cheap and hopefully effective.
Note. I'm using this with a Sony Action Camera. I still have to trade in my EOS400d for a camera body with video capture.

Have you ever used a 3DR Solo? I'm asking because i'm thinking about getting one. It has a Follow Me mode and several other significant features specifically for shooting action video, and there are a few bundles you can get that include a go pro with gimble and all. For somebody like me who doesn't have anyone to hold a camera or follow them with a camera, it seems perfect.

after watching a few videos about it, it just blew my mind. I think i'm going to take the plunge on a bundle pretty soon. Also, after reading thier FAQ, it seems they expect to be able to add collision detection and avoidance pretty soon as a software upgrade sue to the fact that the drones are packed with a crazy amount of processing power already. Which means it could potentially follow me through wooded trails and not smash into trees or people.

I haven't flown the 3DR Solo, they had a huge presence at NAB last year and it really seemed like they were the ones who were going to overtake DJI in 2015 but for some reason it never happened. Their software fully integrates with the GoPro but once DJI launched the Phantom 3 with integrated 4k camera, that feature never really became a selling point. The Phantom 3's latest firmware has Follow Me, Point of Interest (360 mode), Way Points and the price drop is pretty massive. $999 for the 4k Advanced and $769 for the 2.7k version. What I dig about the Phantom 4 is the collision avoidance system. The Yuneec Typhoon with collision avoidance was seemingly the drone to beat when they launched at CES this year. But again DJI drops the Phantom 4 out of nowhere with the same features but even better. Even with all these features, it still requires some piloting skills and common sense to avoid fly aways and crashes.

literally half the price of when the DJI's phantom 2's came out... this is pretty crazy considering it's only been a few short years, and I remember thinking (when the phantom 2 came out) that $999 for the phantom 1 without a camera was a deal!

I believe the follow me mode works with both the transmitter and a mobile device in unison. So you need to have both connected for it to work, if I'm not mistaken.

Edit: also, I think follow me is limited as far as framing, as you need to control the tilt of the gimbal manually. The quad will follow you without the need of control, but you or someone else will have to control the gimbal to the angle of your choosing.

Nope, basically the remote connects to your iPhone or iPad. The thing is you'd have to be holding it while riding which can be clumsy since you'll be holding the skate remote as well. You could probably rig it to a backpack or something.

Even with the autonomous features, having a spotter or a pilot with you while riding is crucial for getting proper shots and ensuring safety. I usually don't let anyone fly my drone unless they've put some hours into flying in various conditions.

i'm looking at the phantom 4 now too. I think that's the way to go since they already have collision avoidance and the camera is built in. You could definitely stash the remote somewhere, maybe even inside your hoodie during the shoot. if not, a small backpack would do fine. 

@Sebastiaan what do you mean it doesn't track? Will it still keep you in frame when in follow mode?

Parts acquired......build to resume this weekend.....total tab thus far 90$. Hand held 3-axis gimbal- get some. Also, Phantom 4 looks stupidly awesome.

"Not tracking" means the gimbal will not tilt the camera to keep you in frame. You need to control the pan and tilt yourself, or have somebody else do that for you.

That sort of moots the whole point of getting one for me since the whole reason i'm getting one is so i don't have to have another person doing anything. There is a distinct lack of interested, skilled parties in my world.  Guess i'm going to be looking at the 3DR Solo again as it says it will do exactly this, but without collision avoidance, which they also mention will be coming sometime soon in a firmware update.

@onloop - the video was the inspiration, not accually me. If and when I get this up and running I will write up a post or make a how to video..... programing the gimbal might take more time than anticipated and I'm not sure I have all the hardware to flash in the updated gimbal software.

@trbt555 - 
1.  Buy a micro drone,  one with bumpers for indoors - they run 15$ a piece now practice practice practice.......
2. Upgrade to a 50-70$ slightly larger outdoor model with a camera. *last year when I did this it was a Syma x5c. Buy some extra motors and rotors (beginners will need them. Then practice practice practice....
3. Look for much cheaper Phantom 1-2-3's or start building a drone yourself - crap-ton of videos on the tube of you and oh yea practise more..........
with all of this keep a log of your practice hours and maintenance 
Congats now in addition to eboards you have a second not cheap hobby with developing tech...... :smile:

I'm thinking of ditching the flashlight for a handle and instead going with a C shaped stabilizer like this guy..........

Agreed with @monkey32 I got a Blade Nano Micro to mess around with indoors, stepped up to a Syma X5C, got into a MiniFPV racing for awhile so I built my own 250/150 racing drones then got the Phantom 3. The gradual step up gives you the ability to fly manual if GPS fails you. Just having spatial awareness and understanding how to control roll, pitch and yaw is fundamental. Once you get that down you can concentrate on composing your shots. I know a few guys who have totaled their drones by focusing on their shot first and piloting second.

I'd guess not.. to be honest I was wondering how they managed to film that whole video without getting yelled at by a cop; or maybe they did get yelled at, and just ignored it or went to a different street.  

It seems like a ton of people would complain about the smell, and the fact that they have smoke hovering on their street. 

I feel like if you did it in a discreet area, no one would care- that's why I was surprised they were shooting in the middle of San Fran.

I wasn't necessarily referring to the filming, but more so just having a ton of smoke that smells bad and can irritate your eyes (from experience with those exact smoke grenades). 

That said, I agree that if you looked out your window and saw three dudes on boards shoot down your street you probably wouldn't give a flip- I just think there has gotta be those people that just get whole-heartedly pissed off by this kind of thing, and would in turn call the cops.

The gimble here on ebay works out to be $290Aus from Honkers. I just checked your link to that gimble and it works out as $450Aus deliveted.  Theres also another one on that site
GVB 3-Axis Handheld Gimbal for GoPro. Its a bit cheaper. Would that be ant good.

 Will have to start saving up for that.  Any other cheaper versions I can look at.  Seems to be the most cost effective and has the encoder.  Have you tried the dji osmo 4k cam with it. @RunPlayBack

The Feiyu WG looks pretty cool and I've heard good things. I like that it's super compact so that you can mount it to just about anything. The Osmo is beautiful but I prefer having my camera and gimbal non integrated unless it's a drone - like the Phantom 3 and up is a perfectly integrated system. My main gimbal at the moment is the Varavon Birdycam Lite but that's mostly for a larger payload like the Sony A7s or Panasonic GH4.

Hola,
I can't speak to performance just yet. Buuuut- updating firmware is cake and once loaded as I understand it,the Storm 32 bit Board with OlliW's site and updates  make for (from my reading at least) the best bang for your buck gimbal out there- OlliW is super active with RC forums and a really legit programmer.

That being said - Both gimbals you linked to are 2 axis gimbals so you'd be covered with pitch and roll........the third brushless motor on 3-axis gimbal takes yawn into account as well which helps smoothing out the shoot a bit more.

This is also why these gimbals you linked to are 2/3 the cost - an extra motor and a board with the ability to expand and control said motor. Adding the third motor also does take a bit of power as well (three li ions rather than two for the two axis gimbal.

The joystick can be had from hobby king i believe......check banggood and gearbest as well.

Just wanted to share this new rig I put together for ESK8. I'll get some test vids up soon but it's actually a really lightweight and portable option for shooting action. Essentially it's the [LanParte LA3D](http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1200017-REG/lanparte_la3d_detachable_3_axis_wired.html) detachable handheld gimbal paired with a [Polar Pro Trippler](http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1215016-REG/polar_pro_triplr_trippler_3_in_1_tripod_grip_pole.html). The best part on the trippler is the rubberized grip that folds out to transform into a tripod.

So action gimbals are all the rage these days, especially for filming ESK8, yet the one that really stood out to me at this year's NAB Show in Vegas was the Lanparte LA3D gimbal. Cosmetically, it’s similar to the Came TV Action and the Ikan Fly X3-Go but if you look further, it has some really well thought out design features that make it the best action gimbal out right now. Here's my first impressions. Part 2 will be action stuff, this is more like an unboxing. If you want to [read my full article about the LA3D I published it here](http://runplayback.com/lanparte-la3d-3-axis-action-gimbal-first-impressions).

Dude find a shooter in Vegas and have em ride on one of your spare boards. BTW I was out there last week but didn't get to hit the strip otherwise I would have hit you up. I was mostly hanging around the Mojave Desert, not a lot of smooth roads out there for eboarding. ;)

Upgraded the Storm 32 diy c-grip gimbal with a bike cell holder so i now have a shoot screen. also wrapped the grip with bike tube for a way better feel and less vibration.

Second gimbal arrived today - gonna attempt a pole mounted version next. Too many projects so little time......

Found out that simple suction cup mount is quite handy if you dont want to glue anything to your helmet. The mount sticks nicely to the TSG pass and you can even carry the helmet from the mount. With 2$ 90-degree adapter you can mount the camera to the side and shoot like @Photorph

I have a gopro with a side mount on the side of my full face helmet.  I prefer the side mount over the top mount, the top mount seems too high and not natural.  Also the audio will be horrible, so in order to improve audio I use a cheap $10 lav mic that I attach to the gopro and I have it placed inside the cheek pad of my helmet.  If you will just remove audio and add music, then the mic is not needed.  I already owned a gopro and it came with the sidemount and curved adhesive, I only had to spend a little to get the open skeleton housing (I got a cheapo version from amazon) and a lav mic.

Maybe it will be a new trend, esk8 vlogging... like motovlogging is already a huge thing.

That would be an example of how NOT to take videos on an E-board.

No helmet, holding multiple things, eating and swerving through traffic... Bad example.  On this forum we try to be ambassadors for the future of esk8 and promote safety.  So these boards don't get banned.  Casey is doing the opposite, showing it's cool to ride without a helmet in busy traffic to his millions of followers.

Haha you're right, what he does is pretty dangerous, but you gotta admit with good filming technique though.
I should totally start using helmet too, what bothers the most I guess is the transportability of it.. :sob:

who gives a shit about transportability.

if you truly care about your own well being you will find a way to keep a helmet with you at all times.

only takes one wrong move to become a vegetable.

Agreed. It kind of sucks that he is the highest profile esk8er and he rides without a helmet. Good vids though. We should all get together and send him one.

For what it's worth, even though he's raised the profile of ESK8 tremendously, CN doesn't necessarily bear all the responsibility of being an ambassador of ESK8. I doubt that's even on his radar, he's got other things to focus on. I would rather put that on Boosted. That one video where CN rides the V2, you can hear one of their guys mention that he should be wearing a helmet....yet he doesn't, and that's the end of the convo. Maybe they've tried really hard to get him to wear a helmet and we just aren't privy to that information. But from the outside looking in, it's as if they are more happy to send him as many boards as he needs, to sell more boards, irregardless of the safety message it sends to the uninformed.

It's one thing to ride without a helmet and put up some vids, but to be a manufacturer of esk8's and actively promote through an agent that won't wear a helmet is another. All it takes is for some young kid to want to be just like CN, ride through traffic on a Boosted, no helmet, eating a pizza, and filming it all while they smash their head into a car. 

CN is under no obligation to wear one, and if he doesn't want to, that's his choice. Boosted has have every right to run their business how they want, but endorsing CN riding without a helmet surprises me after George Schnakenberg's death.    

Overall, CN makes some nice really vids and has done a lot to put esk8 on the map. He definitely makes it seem like a lot of fun....which it is!

There are a few vloggers esk8 who arent wearing helmets or protective wear especially when on the road. No doubt they would have all ready been advised in comments to do so. If you give advise and someone ignores it because they are so ignorant of the possible safety issues theres nothing you can do. 

CN has come off and smashed int pedos and hurt his ribs and wrist. Also come off other times as hes ipad coming ff while riding. How he can control a remote and drone at same time begs my undestanding. 

His vds are gettng a tad monotonous now anyway, go for run, go to meeting on board, fly all across the country,  mail time, drop his camera every episode. Drone images of NY. Good on him though for makng one everyday. It takes a fiing alot of tme just to make 5min clip.

Here's a review for this new gimbal that came my way. The Feiyu Tech SPG Plus Smartphone Gimbal. Pretty interesting gimbal for you guys who like to shoot ESK8 on your phones.
