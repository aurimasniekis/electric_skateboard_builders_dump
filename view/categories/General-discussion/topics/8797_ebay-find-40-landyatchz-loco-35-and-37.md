It drives me crazy there are so many good deals for new boards in the US! I was trolling eBay and came across these two beauties (below). I would totally do the Loco 35 but the cost of shipping to Australia is 1.5x the cost of the board. Aargh! :anguished:

Hopefully someone else on this forum will scoop them up, and put them to good use.
