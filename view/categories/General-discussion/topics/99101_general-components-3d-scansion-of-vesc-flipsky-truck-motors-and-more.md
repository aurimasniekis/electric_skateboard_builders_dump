Hi everybody.
I tryed to search on the forum, but didn't find something similar.
I want to start this topic, where you can share a 3d scansion  of your components, i think it's a great idea, if some one want to create something new starting from an existing part.

I mean 3d scanning, because you know when you have complex geometry sometime it's really difficult to catch the right sizes, and a 3D scanner can be a good choice.

So if you have the opportunity, to have a scanner, i know a good one it's really expensive from 3k to 10k and more, but in any case i don't know, maybe you have one at the work,  please share :smile:
