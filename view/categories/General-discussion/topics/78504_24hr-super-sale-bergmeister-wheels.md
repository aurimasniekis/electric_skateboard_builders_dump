@Grozniy: Hi Roman, our pulleys are actually injection moulded (glass fibre and nylon). However, there will be a small set of CNC milled pulleys available mid-January (At least that is the plan...but Chinese New Year is fast approaching...so that may cause some delays).

I will let you all know, once I have them in hand!

In the meantime, you can download the universal adapter from the website https://haggyboard.com/products/universal-60t-adapter

@riako has made a pulley for the TB218 truck, which is currently being tested....it will be also available for download after tests have been completed and everybody survived :slight_smile:

I swapped out the cheap AliExpress 6x2 wheels for these and wow it's such a difference! Rolling resistance is much better and the build quality is just a totally different level...

Also, they come in red!

hi @thiswasandy: the Bergmeister wheels fit on any standard longboard truck. This is because the bearings used are the standard 608 bearings. If I am not mistaken I believe @Riako also used Evolve trucks. Maybe directly get in touch with him.
One thing that you have to take into consideration though is the wheel pulley. Our universal pulley that you can download from haggyboard.com is designed for 15mm wide belts...but given that it is a .stp file, feel free to modify it to your gusto.

@banjaxxed Hi Alan, the raw is actually not raw but sandblast and silver shiny anodized.
The same as with the red color, silver shiny rims give you about 30% more speed than any other colors.

hi @stormboard1

yes it will work with direct drive:

both @Riako as well as @nuttyjeff have designed direct drives using the Bergmeister wheels.

I am also doing a collaboration project together with @nuttyjeff for a direct drive....more details on here: https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/the-avio-at-gear-drive-project/77886


Edit: I have mixed up the terminology, so as to avoid any misunderstanding, please note:

- Gear drive: drives that use gears  // No problem --- see above

- Direct drive: 1:1 ratio where the motor drives the wheel directly...the motor sits right on the axle as opposed to a motor mount.
// should also be no problem....but that depends on a proper adapter. I will have a look at this, as I am not aware of anybody having use the Bergmeister wheels on a direct drive before.

Question, is there any possibility that package (c) would be made available for those who have picked up wheels on this thread? 

Maybe a good thing to discuss with @nuttyjeff

Hey e-riders !
Yes Timo, I'm testing them on my Supercarve trucks with chain drive for now (@thiswasandy) .
It's all good, the second step is at D10mm and not 12mm like Kahua, and the length of this second partition is 21mm long for the evolve and 30mm for the kahua. 
The kahua is really perfect for a gear drive with this space!

I will post an update of the gear drive prototype ready for e-blank-test soon ;) (actually hand spin only...) 
https://amadridefr.files.wordpress.com/2018/12/PICb0187.jpg
I was working on a GD for a long time now, and got the fkn silent etoxx one in hand for inspiration / also ready to rock on my next eMTB :blush:  but here I mainly focused by **the locking system of the Haggyboard motor mount**  and want to try to incorporate almost the same design adapted for my Gear Drive (after asking to Timo of curse), I have two sizes in test actually : 
https://amadridefr.files.wordpress.com/2018/12/untilnew_2018_customizedview2055117082.jpg
A small one for 50mm only (30 (Maytech/TB/etc and 38mm (Racerstar)), with 1.5m and a bit more compact.
And the bit bigger one, for 50 and 63mm motor, working with m2 and larger gear tooth.
And remixing a dual helical anti-sideload (and auto-centered if I can say, after my hand spinning blank tests) gear to test after the straight one.

This is great, really amped on this collaboration

It would be nice to have some more big wheel love next @riverside.rider, specifically 9"

There is a distinct lack of affordable 9" options out there. 3DServisas is coming out with a 9" with superstar pattern that will fit a variety of gear drives, I guess primarily their own 1:5 drive of which I have a beta of, I'm too heartbroken to replace it yet although 1:5 gearing is right for 9" for sure.
![image|347x304](upload://kXhk1lsWfGmF9oZi0T3YAHPs7W1.jpeg) 

Trampa has a drive which fits both 9" and 8" which is cool and looks it, but ouch $$$ (ok you get motors included)
![image|206x207](upload://vLGelgomAMSNB3sl1PdE8K4Z70L.jpeg) 

You kind of have to beat something out of etoxx in this area it's unlisted really but I think he can do a MBS ->Fivestar  to Superstar hub adapter if you get truck adapters to make the trucks longer etc. 
![image|562x485](upload://jICu56KekDlOuJAxMYYdZ0x14GR.jpeg) 

Kaly stops at 8" 1:4 drive uses superstar pattern
![image|254x261](upload://39zDYoEBjO3Rf9FfQP3fysle3j.jpeg) 

Look at the MBS hub, a hub which fits both 8" and 9" is fantastic
https://www.mbs.com/parts/13211-mbs-fivestar-hub-1-white

Imagine if it fitted all the vendor drives/hole patterns above ^ without an adapter
One hub to rule them all, you just need to give it some lip

@banjaxxed: Hi Alan, indeed that would be nice, but right now we are doing baby steps and ensuring we get our stuff right. For the time being, the focus is on the collaboration project with @nuttyjeff and we are also doing some work on our enclosure + custom BMS + Vesc derivative. This has taken already a lot of time and the injection moulding procedure does not really allow for mistakes.

I will keep the above in mind and may have a try at it next summer.

Yeees, more 9" wheels please ^^

I ride this 9" since more than a year, with the Fivestar hub on my vertigo trucks.
I love the 9", but actualy Andy and the compared make me curb my desires.
Really heavy but lovely.

I can set this 9" swapping the etoxx wheel adapter from the mbs to trampa kit and make it work with the trampa GD. But would like to set it on my matrix 2 extented. But only 8" with rockstar hub.
Kugelis making the 9" compatible with 8" hub other stuff is really clever.

That's cool, yea Kug3lis is wrapping up this segment at the mid price point; my point.

The 3DServisas 9" hub is only rated for 9" tires I think, not sure if it fits 8" tires at all, the product page has different listing for both. The MBS fivestar hub says that it should be doable, so I do not understand why everyone doesn't do this, not sure if there is a patent on the lip or such.

The E-toxx adapter solution is great but increases truck width usage which is not ideal

Not sure if the Trampa drive supports all wheel types - superstar, trampa 9" and MBS, it may do :thinking:

I like variety, good stuff Haggyboard :slight_smile:

Hello everybody,
thanks for all the interest and purchases! Definitely much much more than I have anticipated. We nearly cleared all the stock.
All orders have been fulfilled and are on the way to those who have ordered. Tracking numbers have been sent out.
We will have more stock mid-January with exciting new hub /rim colors. All going well there may very well be another super 24hr sale on the horizon.

Also, we are still in the process of having the pulleys machined for the TB218 / Bergmeister setup. Once we are happy with everything, we will be releasing the files for everybody to freely use and modify.

thanks everybody and merry Christmas and Happy New Year. I am off for a little vacation with my family.

Timo

You'll need 90mm axles to accommodate the pullys needing a bearing. 
And a special bearing for the pullys.  
Timo figured out the proper bearing. I have a link somewhere.

If you still have a order coming from tiller.  Be sure to ask him for the spacers he sells for surfrodz trucks.  You'll need some between the inner wheel bearing and pully bearing.

@Steven1 : yes, @skunk tried out the 60T pulley (for the Bergmeister) as well as our 36T pulleys (one compatible with Kegel core and the other compatible with Abec Flywheels). 

In order to make our pulleys work with the **90mm axles / Surfrodz** two things are required:

- some spacers ( I am working on making a custom spacer to ensure a perfect fit)
- a pulley bearing **FAG 16100-A-2Z**, which has a 10mm inner diameter (instead of our 6001 bearing which has an inner diameter of 12mm).

I found the FAG bearing to be extremely expensive  here in Taiwan (about USD 14,- per piece)...I am looking for alternative suppliers at the moment, but I believe they can also be purchased for much less directly on Amazon or Ebay.

I will keep you all posted on developments.

SHIPPING DELAYS TO CALIFORNIA:

dear all,
there have been a total of 4 of you that have ordered the Bergmeister wheels around the 21st of December last year, which have not yet been received.
Packages turned out not to be traceable by the EMS shipping network nor by USPS. I have sent a formal complaint to EMS as to why there is absolutely no information on the whereabouts for the goods ordered.

Today I received the following official update directly from my local post office (which handles all packages sent via EMS courier): 
Translated the below document roughly states that "**...due to lack of Human Resources in the Los Angeles postal department there is a backlog of parcels, which caused a delay in delivery**"

So this is to say that your packages are not lost, just in backlog. This may also be useful to those that may have ordered from other vendors and are still waiting for their components to arrive.

best regards
Timo

**it is confirmed:** 
green will be made. However, there will only be a very limited amount of them. The below is a reference picture from our CNC milling company for the type of green that the rims will be made of. Please note that the perception of the color really depends on the light. They may look completely different under fluorescent light compared to natural daylight.

Edit: surface will be sandblasted (same with all previous rims) and the surface will be shiny

[/quote]
sorry, I did have a bit too little sleep last night and I may not fully understand you:

by gear hubs, are you referring to a pulley? if so, it is very easy to mount pulleys of various widths and diameter to the wheel. Each wheel has three main bolts to which any pulley can be screwed on to.

In the below picture you see a 60T pulley that makes the Bergmeister compatible with the TB218 truck as well as the Evolve GT truck.

The pulley will be made available to download for free on the haggyboard.com website within this week. Best to have it CNC milled. We will be starting to sell this POM pulley by end of February, for those that do not wanna do them on their own.

Is it too late to cast another serious vote for some bronze wheels? Imo, they look surprisingly good on just about everything. It's more interesting looking than silver, less flashy than gold or copper, and has a warm metallic tone that's very versatile and unique. Please make these, so I won't have any excuses left to not buy these. :pray:

Hi sorry for the n00b question. Is there a trick for inflating and measuring tire pressure on pneumies? It seems just measuring the pressure drops pressure by half. :slight_smile:

I tried this

https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B010JFWDHS/

with something similar to this

https://www.amazon.com/JACO-BikePro-Presta-Pressure-Gauge/dp/B078RDZ9S9

Then switched to this, which has a built in not-too-accurate gauge

https://www.homedepot.com/p/Husky-120-Volt-Inflator-HY120/301753174

Inflated to 65psi, then disconnect quickly, then measure pressure, shows 30psi. Doh! So somewhere between disconnecting the inflator and measuring with the gauge I lose 30psi.

For now I'm going to 65psi on the inflator gauge and quickly disconnecting and praying. I don't know what I would do with the hand pump though, which doesn't have a gauge built in.

Get yourself one of these pumps. Someone else on here linked to one of these and it makes setting pressures so easy. The hose screws on to the valve, and loses very little air when disconnecting.

If this ends up breaking, I'm gonna try one of these. So far so good though.

This one doesn't have a gauge built in. There's another one with a pencil style gauge built in. I'm not sure if it's much better than no gauge though... And reviews mention it's kind of a knock-off of Lezyne pumps, which sent me down another rabbit hole. 

[quote="topcloud, post:193, topic:78504"]
I suggest the Topeak Pocket Shock DXG:
[/quote]

At first I was like, 360psi? That makes the gauge kind of useless and I'm sure it'll need a lot more pumps. But then I read about the 2 stage valve connector, that separates connection from valve release, so you can disconnect without losing *any* air (the hiss is the air pressure in the hose, not from the tire). This is a big differentiator for shock pumps. Thanks @topcloud for learning me up.

@accrobrandon also thanks. You guys are all awesome!

## \#200 Posted by: deucesdown Posted at: 2019-07-09T16:40:17.662Z Reads: 107

One last follow up. I've tried:

- 120v care tire inflator (a decent quality one) with built in gauge and level lock valve
- good quality standalone pressure gauge with press-on valve
- amazon bike pump with no gauge and valve built into body and lever lock
- aluminum generic ebay shock pump with gauge and hose with screw on valve
- topeak dxg shock pump with gauge and hose and screw on 2-stage valve

All of above worked to some extent, but for these small somewhat high pressure tires, I'd only use a pump with built in gauge and 2 stage valve like the topeak. The generic ebay shock pump works well as a pump, and quality is really good for the price, but sadly it loses some pressure when disconnecting, and at least for me not a repeatable amount of air.

The 2 stage valves have separate stages for connecting airtight, and for depressing the actual valve. The topeak has a separate screw for the latter stage. This lets you pump up to the exact pressure you want, and disengage the valve before disconnecting the connection, losing zero pressure. For me this ended up being the critical feature. It really ticked my OCD not knowing the pressure, and nto having consistent pressure. :)

[Some other pumps](https://www.amazon.com/GIYO-Pressure-Shock-Suspension-Nozzle/dp/B074DBPMDK/) have a lever. Some other pumps perform this function with just a screw-on valve.

Also, the shock pumps tend to have a air bleed button so if you overshoot, you can release some air. You can use this in conjunction with the 2 stage valve when you disconnect, to release all the pressure before disengaging the airtight connection.

Theoretically [this adapter](https://www.amazon.com/GIYO-Pressure-Shock-Suspension-Nozzle/dp/B074DBPMDK) serves the same purpose but it's a big chunk of the DXG pump's overall cost.

The only thing I didn't like about the Topeak, and it's minor, is that the gauge is for 300psi, so the usable portion of the gauge (resolution) is tiny. The pump volume (how quickly it pumps) is low, but it's a trade-off for size, so I'm okay with it.

I'm using the electric pump to get in the ballpark, then the DXG for 10-30 strokes to get it right on the money.
