This week happened, what I was sure never could happen with me...
After a long workday and some modifications on my board I just wanted to go for a test ride. I plugged in the XT90 Antispark to get my system running, but...
Fu** I plugged the Loopkey into the charging port...
3sec and no way back...90sec and the work of the last 6month gone...
There are two things which saved our flat
1. and most important, thanks to @Eboosted  that he shared his experience with his first and hopefully only fire. Because of this I bought some fire covers, fire extinguisher and had a 5l bottle of salt water close to my workplace.
2. the bullet prove deck from @trampa ... as the board was laying up side down the fire couldn´t burn through the board, and saved most of our wooden floor

I got the fire fast under control as I threw the two covers over and put out the last flames with the water and the extinguisher. 
Till the fire brigade arrived I already managed all.

Why I share this?
For me it is a big pain in the a**...still can´t believe how I could be so stupid...
I was reading before a lot about all the safety against fire topics here and I see people saying
"no problem, I´ll just throw the board out of the window..."
Sorry, but NO, you will not.
If it start to burn you will probably run or shit in your pans rather than to take the board in your hands hand threw it away...

I live in a big house, second floor...don´t want to imagine what would happen if the floor would start to burn.
Man it´s a fucking shit load of energy we put on or under our boards.
Just want to say you all:
Take care, always 110% focus on what you do. 
Be prepared, always have a fire extinguisher, bottle of salt water (5L or more), bag of sand or some of these

close to your workplace.
Or even **BETTER**, **ALL** of it.

Take responsibility and find a safe workspace. Not only for you, also for your family and neighbors.
Best to find a garage, container or workshop, where you just can let things burn (that´s what I´ll do for sure).

Believe me, it´s no fun to clean the flat after a LiIon or LiPo fire...
You can´t imagine how much shit is in this batteries, and where all the dust will lay down.

Thank you to all who read till here and take my words to the heart!
Stay tuned, ride safe!

And here some last memories...before and after:

This is one more reason to use a BMS.

I've never seen a BMS charging system using an XT90 for charging, it's usually a 5.5 x 2.1mm barrel connector, plus there is a safety shutdown on the charge circuit

thx. hope so too, but need to change the work place.
don´t want to have this things close to the people I love.
I can handle the lose of the board,
I can clean the flat, I can live with the smell of burned batteries, but I never ever could live with the thoughts that I responsible for burning down the flats of other people.
I´m very lucky how everything went, but that's not always like this.
It even don´t need to be your fault.
there are tons of reasons why batteries can start to fire.

Happy for you keeping up ..... We should really prevent these sorts of fires... if someone ist interested in it i`d do  a list of things you need to think about when building or using li-xx batterys for save battery handling. As i have seen that at least half of the fires in the forums could ve been easily prevented.

Always use different plugs for loop and charging (male and female), always drop the fuse behind the charge port. E.g. Little fuse BF1 50-80A, depending on max drain. Even when using a BMS, the Fuse is imperative. A BMS can also go wonky and cause a short.

Holly sh!t man! That's was a close call. I'm. Glad you manage to save the house yourself. Once fire starts is very difficult to get it under control, I'm really happy my experience saved prople around the world. 

Hope you don't mind answering these questions, might help others in the future:

How long it took before the fire starts between the moment you plugged the wrong port and the first flame of fire? 

How long did you take to pour the fire extinguisher into the flames? 

Did you use the salt water before or after the fire extinguisher? Did it help?

That must have been a crazy experience. I'm impressed you kept calm and took out the fire. I would probably have throw it out the window but now im doubting. Thanks for some fire instructions.

I'm glad you're good and hopefully your next board is going to be even cooler and safer after this experience. Good luck in the future and I'm looking forward to see your next build :slight_smile:

Well, as it was a direct short it took about 3sec. Than the batteries start to blow gas into the air. After 30sec. they start to blown up under the the battery tray. Flames I have seen only after the battery tray was totally destroyed.
I first threw the two plankets over the board.
It held back the flying hot melted rubber and other parts when the cells exploded.
Our 30sqm room was totally filled with smoke after 1min and I needed to leave the room to breath and come back.
After this I used the fire extinguishers. Unfortunately I bought just the small one for cars. Was enough for 30sec. to cover the batteries, but not enough to shut down the fire.
The cells start to fire from inside again and again. 
I was waiting for 1-2min than used the salt water, which finally stopped everything from burning.
I wouldn’t use the water in first place as it would just run away fast. If the cells already close to burn out it helps very good.
Can’t say if you really need salt water or if in my case just water would be enough.
All in all it took me five to seven minutes till all fire was shut down.

I wouldn’t recommend to hold your board in the hands after cells start to burn. They sometimes explode and hot melted rubber fly around or flames spiking. I‘m very happy that I had the blanks which covered the most shit. One wall was not totally lucky and got a nice mosaic of hot rubber-plastic. Luckily it didn’t hit me.

Tho I don't have any hard evidence to back this up I think it's much safer to use thin cables that are rated lower and they'd hopefully burn out in this kind of situation.

Something to keep in mind for future builds

My thoughts exactly. 
A high amp non bypassed BMS would have shut the power down before any damage could occur. 

I shorted my charging port once and my bms shut it down instantly so only the charge port was damaged

And honestly, there was a second board planed. I already ordered some parts.
My summer vacation is close. Will take a break from some weeks, than get a garage or workshop and than just hope that all parts will arrive one after each other.
Maybe I should start a build threat next time?🤔

No because the short was on the charge wires.

Don’t see a reason to fuse balance leads.
It’s what, 22awg usually. They just will burn out in a second and nothing will happen. 
They already like small fuses😉
To fuse the charge and discharge wires makes sense though.

I am glad that you are ok and nobody was hurt. 

I'm sorry about all your wasted hard work you put into that board though :(

This is something i learned from the automotive industry: ALWAYS design/create things so that they are impossible to plug in the wrong way. 

I know that everyone here loves the plain bullet connectors, but it leaves so much room for error. And like you said, it only takes 3 seconds of not paying attention. At least use two different sized bullet connectors.

The funny thing is, I work with electronics every day at work. There everything double three times safes with fuses, Relais etc...like for idiots that nothing can happen...with my own build I didn’t made anything, wanted to use xt60 for charg leads...didn’t used xt60 because I had holders only for xt90...so stupid. 
The idea to just swap one to male one to female is so easy but didn’t came in my head...shit happen always when you don’t think about it, so yes always crest everything that really every idiot can’t make anything wrong and even if than there is a safety mechanism which cut of everything

Don’t see a reason to fuse balance leads.
[/quote]


Not generally no.  In my case I don't have a BMS so my balance leads go all the way out to the charge port.  I will add them just because the run is so long.  A short in 22GA wire could do a lot of ancillary damage.

Also, the fuse I cited is 2A.  If your charger supports more than that adjust accordingly.
