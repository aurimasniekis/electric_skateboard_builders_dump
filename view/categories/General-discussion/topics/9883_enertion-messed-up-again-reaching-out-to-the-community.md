So the backstory for this post is that I ordered the drive kit from enertion about a month ago. When I got the order, it came pre-assembled but it wasn't assembled correctly. The key from the motors keyhole was not in place. I contacted Enertion about it, and they told me they would send me the missing parts for free (I also didn't get all the bearings and the 5.5mm bullet connectors). So I thought to myself that's really cool of them. But today I went to get the package and of course NO KEY, only bullet connectors and bearings.

So now I'm reaching out to the community hoping that you have a solution for my problem. I have everything set except for the key for the motor. Has anyone had a similar kind of experience, and what did you do to solve it? There must be some kind of DIY solution for this. Can I just put a screw in the motor pulley or something like that? Thanks

get some LOCTITE 648. all you need! glue your pulley at your motor and its strong as fk. esk8.de is using this on every build and so do i.

note that there's a possibility of putting too much of it and not being able to remove it afterwards (I've been there, actually I am there ^^)

my advice would be to get the key from somewhere local, I believe it should be something you can find in a hardware store probably, if you are going to apply the green loctite try with a small amount, let it cure for a day, see if the pulley stays on, if not re-apply a bigger amount... and repeat

Look on Ebay for Key steel, cheap as chips. I presume it is a 3mm keyway?
Anyway all you need then is a file to make it fit. 
Loctite would work but suppliers only do that because it is cheaper and easier for them than using keys. Gluing a gear on a shaft is IMHO not really a good option. Do it properly and use the key.

@makevoid, you can use a heat gun for this:

With enough heat you can remove it. Did that already. But to remove it with heat spin it instead of pulling it. That helped for me. You can use a soldering iron.

Thanks for the tip!

I tried with a lighter for 3-5 min as I don't have a heatgun, I'll probably try it again another time with that and then get a heatgun, get a better battery terminal puller and try with that and/or brake the mount and/or grind the pulley with an angle grinder and a dremel.  I really put a lot of green loctite on it T_T

Try to apply heat for a while. After a couple of minutes it was relatively easy to spin it. Don't try with too much force if you want to use the pulley again.

that's been my experience. This isn't typical behavior. People make mistakes. 

i've not had an issue with missing parts from Enertion very often at all and i order shit from them all the time. But i never order fully assembled stuff. I get the pulleys, mounts, belts, and motors separately and i usually end up with extra parts. Keys come in the bag with the pulleys and grubs, motors come with bullets and extra ring clips, mounts come with  grubs for the clamps, etc. I started passing the hex keys along to the customer for my builds as part of the tool kit.

i'm actually looking for extra pulley keys as well since i've lost a few of my extras here and there while moving things around and organizing. Maybe my search fu isn't that great right now, but i'm not seeing it. Can you post a link?

I have an extra key if you want but I'm in Canada hahaha. I also had a bad experience with enertion. They sent me 2 front trucks so I ended up having to cut one of them since enertion never responded (I bought from enertion and payed $30 more to avoid this!!). They also sent me a VESC without the pins to connect to the receiver, which isn't a big deal, except they ignored my complaint again, saying I should just solder it myself. I ended up soldering, but I had seen in a previous case, onloop offered to pay for someone else to install the pins, or even have the person send the VESC back to Australia and have him solder the pins on. I got radio silence after 2 additional responses :frowning:

this might be it.. if somebody else can put eyes on it for me. I think these will work.

3mm x 3mm x 16mm pre-cut keys from Grainger. The keyway on the enertion motors is 3mm X 18mm so these should fit. It's a bag of 50 of them for $13.80, so yeah, cheap as chips. Well, a lot of chips. lol

Yeah, that was for demonstration purposes only! :slight_smile:

Actually the amount of Loctite 648 (green) will not have an influence on it's strength, but in general it's very strong, almost like welding it to the shaft. The reason we went that way was not because of costs, but based on countless times of loosing the grub screws or destroying their threads. 

Normally you don't change that pulley very often, but it has to be staying in place else it's not funny to push your board home because the pulley became loose. The heat which needs to be applied has to be >270Â°C.

Ace Hardware  has keys in the hardware section, just have to grind them a tiny bit to make them fit. Dexter sells them for $1

Are Lowes and Home Depot's not considered hardware stores? I always perceived them as one.

EDIT: weird the message above mine disappeared..

No sir, lowes and the depot are one stop shopping for the home owner. A hardware store has a better selection of hardware.

Edit: I might have accidentally made it disappear,  because I was trying to add to it and I didn't push the right button or whatnot... I just got off shift drinking a couple beers before bed, computing on my new s7 phone

This is the only place i jave gotten responses from enertion (in a timely manner) and ace does carry the key. Its in there little slide out boxes with every size possible. They also have bearings and alot of metric nuts and bolts, lowes and homedepot dont carry much of that. They only carry what they can sell alot of.

i just ordered a sack of 50 3x3x16mm keys. Hopefully i'll be able to have some on hand for a while, they seem to be one of the things i drop on the floor or misplace on a pretty regular basis. 

So once they come in i'll be happy to share a few if somebody loses theirs. The floor of my shop is like the void of the universe. Things just disappear forever it seems lol

LOCTITE 648
[/quote]

Be careful with heat guns and motors. If you are not careful you'll heat the can which either melts the magnets adhesive, making them loose, or the heat itself demagnetises them.

When I heated my loctite glued pulley to get it off the shaft it was not more than handwarm on the motor site. I only applied heat to the pulley and the shaft on the pulley site. Took a while but then it came off. When also a key is in you would have a hard time I guess. Maybe you should only use a little drop of loctite when you use a key to stop rattling.

thats how you do it.
to prevent your motor from damaging just capsulate it with something thatÂ´s not transfering heat, like 2 pieces of wood :slight_smile:

But the pulley could transfer heat to the shaft and then to the motor.
I think it would be better if you attach a big metal plate in front of the motor (when there is space) that acts as heatsink.

They're right about the effortlessly part. USually i can pull the pulleys off by twisting the bolt by hand but when you can't a socket on the end of a low speed drill will bring it right off without a scratch, and the bolt fits into that 8mm bore beautifully, so no need to use a screw or anything else as a shim.
