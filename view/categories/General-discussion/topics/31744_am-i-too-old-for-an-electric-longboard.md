don't think so. I would love my dad to have cool hobby like u! 
Beside, there are RC-ist which looks like playing toys from outside look
 and skateboarding is more of a sport.

That depends on how much you care about opinions. I have been told many times "you shouldn't be riding that thing, you are not a kid"
I don't give a shit and I keep riding.....

Why did you tell her ??? :scream:You were just looking for trouble! About the same age as you and I would get the same response if I told her. Is there actually an age to do anything? I saw recently a video of a 78 year-old guy doing kitesurfing. I would like to be him at that age.

I'll be 60 years old this Dec.

Electric longboards were made for old guys - first, they have brakes.  Second, you don't have to push so much.  Third, they're expensive.  Lastly, we (our generation anyway) invented skateboarding.

I think that properly marketed e-longboarding could be a huge resurgence sport and it's a damn sight more fun and interesting than RC airplanes.

I'm 54.  And IIRC I'm not the oldest person on this forum.  Get an "Old Guys Rule" t-shirt and ride on :-)

Edit 1: if your wife thinks you're old at 47 she's not going to like what happens next :slight_smile:
Edit 2: I have software speed limiting on all my boards.  The beginner boards top out at 17 mph, the bigger boards just over 20 mph.  I do believe that speed is for the kids because the difference is that if they get injured it hurts and they have great stories.  If we get injured it's a whole season lost.

You're a couple of years younger than my dad, but when I made my ESK8 and my dad said "hold on, let me try this" I actually said no :sweat: . I was legit just scared that he would fall and break something or hurt his back as he's already having a lot of pain in his back. I simply associate a 50 year old man to not be cable of riding it. (I'm 21). It's actually weird, when my parents tell me to no ride that dangerous board, I'm like don't worry it's safe. But when my dad wants to ride it, I think it's to dangerous for him :p .

But if you're still fit, then why not I guess? If you're almost already cripple like my dad (Okay I exaggerate quite a bit perhaps) then you may need to consider.
Just wear protection and set an example for your son!
If I'd meet you on the street I wouldn't care how old you are, I'd want to know how dope your ESK8 is.

Yeah 34 did my build last year at 33 also had the passing thought perhaps I'm too old for this but really if you're in decent health or you're just careful to not hurt yourself badly as you're learning (and have health insurance) then you're in good shape :)  Really I get more frightened when I see some 13 year old or around that age on the forums here going gung ho on building the fastest rocket stick they can.

I'm turning 38 in a few months and have a 2.5 year old daughter, she's the only thing holding me back from doing stupid "young" stuff any more. esk8 seems better for older people anyway as it's an expensive hobby and requires safety and responsibility.

@JAG1 no way, you're not too old! I'm 40 and ride ~20 miles a week on my esk8, and build and ride my own.

You might get some looks of disdain from less-enlightened peers, but I like to think that they are deeply envious of the freedom, creativity, and physical prowess we display when we zip past them! Who wants friends who will judge you for trying something new anyway?!

Fair warning to anyone, of ANY AGE starting this new sport though; you need to practice good judgement and caution. It also helps tremendously if you know how to ride a regular non-electric longboard. And always wear a helmet. Make a concerted effort to avoid injury, because the "I told you so" will echo for eternity in your social world if you end up in a cast.

Age is just a number.  42 here and no plan to stop anytime soon.

If you are smart - work on good longboarding skills, and ride within your skill - it's great.  If you try to go too fast, and have a failure it can be a painful lesson.  Wear gear appropriate for the speed you want to ride.  Helmet and gloves would be my minimum recommendation.

But hell - they are just jealous!  Go ride!  electric or other - it's all about moving and keeping your balance as you get older!!

Good luck man!

I'm 53 and got mine 2 years ago and it made me feel 10 years younger, I regained a bunch of balance that I hadn't even realized I lost. However if you have never skateboarded in your life it might be a tad dangerous having wheels under your feet that at a pull of a finger can sent you going 23 mph down the road! 
  I think your wife wants to not feel left out and old herself.

If you care what people think, then you might NOT be old enough. I feel like there is a certain point in your life when you mature enough to just say "I don't give a fuck what people think" and do whatever you want. Sometimes that might be when you're 20 sometimes it might be when you're 60, but if you've achieved that level of enlightenment, then I think you owe it to yourself to get an esk8. 

And a cool looking helmet. That's important. Lol

Hi, WOW! thank you for all the great positive advice. Me and my son already ride  longboards round the park as i thought it would be a great way for my son to learn, as he had been trying to learn on my old skateboard from 1985!! 
He did fall off and chip his front tooth! had it glued back and got on the board again the following week! 

i think electric boards would be great fun to do together. i have been looking a Meepo boards for us, but not sure yet?

Thanks again for all the kind words....and yes I'm not to old

I'm 42, I used to ride my skateboard everyday when I was a teen, last year at age 41 I discovered this amazing hobby and I can't stop, not even thinking about letting this go, ever, I ride everyday back and forth to my job 6 miles away. 

Everybody here will tell you "you aren't old to e-sk8", I agree 100% with that statement but I also understand that starting with this sport is not that easy as when you were 15, you will have to ride clumsily for the first days which does not feel very cool, you will fall which will also scare the shit out of people and family, falling at 50 is different than falling at 20 y/o, you would have to ride very slow and continuously get of the board on close turns. 

When people tell you, they think it's pretty cool you are riding and electric longboard, they might be thinking, yeah that's adorable, you don't want to look adorable in the eyes of people, it's the same as when you see 80 y/o grandpa riding a race car, but when this grandpa steps on the car and makes a perfect drift on a race track, then he becomes respected and admired for life, at this point you start enjoying e-skateboarding. 

Now here is the fun part, if you keep riding everyday you will get the hang of it and become a good rider in between 2 days and 1 week, after a month you will ride like an expert much better than a 20 year old starting on the hobby, will get to nearby places faster than a car and you won't let your hobby go EVER

Go for it and don't let small issues discourage you in the process.

My kid is 2 months old and I'm 42, however I feel like 30, my GF works in Delta so we have a good deal on flight tickets, my idea is to wait at least 5 years to travel with him around the world with our e-boards and backpacks with a lot of spare parts to keep the shredding going.

Well I am almost 51 years old and got my Dual E Toxx drive on a Trampa holypro a couple of weeks ago and loving it!  I actually got it for off roading, jumping and fooling around.  Your own body is the one to tell you if you are too old dude and depending on how physically fit you are.

I Think there is no such a thing: too old or too young for skateboarding. 

https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/my-9-month-old-son-on-longboard/30745


Most important is to do what you feel. You can decide what you want to do, other opinions are their opinions only. You live your life from your perspective, so do what you have to do not listen those dogmas, those templates of artifical life models. Your inner self knows what is best for you, just believe your feelings.☺

For me: I'll be skating till my last day, it's just awesome. I'm in love with lonboards/snowboards/ kiteboards/ mountainboards and of course esk8😍

I am up there too :wink:  I find though a longboard is a little stiff on my knees. I been riding my E-MTB and it seems the bigger tires and flexible deck... they help a lot.

The days I decide to take the train instead of drive... I use one of these to commute... real portable, and stable -- speedometer I get about 35mph top speed on a straightaway .... I don't know if I will ever trust the really bad Atlanta drivers with me on an eSkateboard but with the eScooter I have more control with like my 30lb backpack on in the morning...

I'm not a big fan of the zboards - when I'm riding on concrete and there are significant gaps or heave between the panels I like to put all my weight on the back wheels while the front rolls over the gap/heave - I think you can't do this with a ZBoard without it slowing or stopping.

Seems like having to keep your weight forward to go fast is a recipe for disaster.

Maybe someone who has one can school me otherwise?

I fully support larger wheels.

Let me know when you're ready for a Cadillac brother. I can do a foam top on big soft wheels and enough range to get you anywhere, with a nice casual acceleration curve but enough power to feel like you're on something good. Soft and smooth with plenty of torque.

Well, we shall find out! Not commuting so I can pick ideal riding surfaces. Got a bike trail 2 blocks away that is very smooth, goes right to the grocery store or bars, resturants and coffee shops the other way.  And I do like the grab and go simplicity of the Zboard. 24 mile range is also impressive at their price point. This guy seems to do just fine on typical urban bumps/cracks.  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=qwkRGwW05Mo

Just got back from my first esk8 ride. No drama  except for my calfs feeling fatigued.  The foot pad controls on the Zboard do take some practice and I'll need some hours to become proficient.  Started on beginner mode but put it in normal on a 2 block stretch uphill.  Climbed right up. Going to be awhile before I can test the range because my calf muscles need conditioning. Nice way to get some freah air.

My mistake; I though I read somewhere in the forum about an Alabama bearded dude pulling a baby carriage while dragging his eboard thru the park. (It must have been a dad) :smile:

OMG, not me, not at all me.  I would hook the baby carriage to the board and pull it at 25 mph...survival of the fittest right :slight_smile:

Its definitely doable.  I'm trying to build a universal joint that has a truck top mount plate on 1 side and a bike mount on the other so I can hook up a wagon and take my big ass german shepherd out...the only problem is she absolutely hates stuff that rolls :frowning:

Nope, she will not. (is the closest thing to men sitting for an entire month in front of their 60' inch 4K tvs watching the world cup):yum: :crazy_face: :soccer: :ru: :tv:

From my personal experience: Just build her one and get her excited, she´ll love it ;) We´re doing Sunday-trips together since then

I'm 38 years old and just built my first electric longboard a month ago. Now my 38 year old wife wants me to build her one too.  Guess I'm a lucky dude.

I was around 37 when i got into it too. I'm 41 now and i've been so completely taken by it that i build boards all the time and ride anytime i have a free minute. 

There's an 76 year old man i met last week who chased me down with his grossly over powered fat tire ebike (seriously, he didn't even have a chain. The man was not about to pedal assist) just to see if esk8 was something he wanted to try out. We talked a while, bought some beer and went back to my shop. He decided he didn't want to try the board, but i did hella donuts in my front yard on his bike. I think we're friends now.

Haha, that's an awesome story.  I  get what you are saying on getting completely over taken.  This hobby is becoming an addiction.  Since my last post, my wife and I have started riding together.  It's so much fun when you get to ride with someone else.  Now my 10 year old son is begging me to build him one too.  Ugh.

I am 53 creeping up on 54. I have put 2,000 plus miles on my boards since February. You are never too old. Maybe just too cautious!![Screenshot_20191214-095840_Strava|281x500](upload://6kDLXDVwJ8sQdQoTMNS63baHrWJ.jpeg)

Some of my friends are already 50+ and they still look cool on an electric longboard. So go for it no matter what your age is.
