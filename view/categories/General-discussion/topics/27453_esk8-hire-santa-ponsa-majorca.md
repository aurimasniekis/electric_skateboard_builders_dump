Hey dude i am in Mallorca but i am from South Africa.
 Santa Ponsa is pretty close to Palma the main city.

 I dont know any places like that man but i can check around for you, only e-bikes for rent as far as i know.

 I am actualy trying to raise capital to build my own e-boards to rent out here in Mallorca mainly mountainboards. I am the only one i know of that has a electric mountainboard here, its pretty insane , built it myself . Dual vesc 6.4s Trampa motors and motor mounts,  2 - 40v batteries one for each vesc :). If ya wanna meet up and go for a ride on it , we can do that . 

Pictures of my board with old vesc 4.12s
