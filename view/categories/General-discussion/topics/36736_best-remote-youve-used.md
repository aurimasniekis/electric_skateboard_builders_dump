it's ridiculous how I have like 5 horsepower come from motors at maybe 1mm of transmitter trigger travel.  Newbies flip off the board like rag dolls and experienced people still have trouble dealing with the sensitivity.  It seems the most dangerous part of the board for this and other reasons.

 I'm looking for something that has more travel and that travel is connected to good incremental adjustment on the throttle and brake (Ive found some remotes seem to have maybe only 4 or 5 degrees of braking possible), good reception, a battery that lasts and also has a warning when low, doesn't break on the first fall to the ground,  and small.

the best I've come across is the mini trigger and its pretty good except the travel isn't as large as I'd like and it doesn't have quite the increments of adjustment on the braking I'd like

I've got the mini trigger. Cheap and replaceable.
Used the gtb2 but was too large. Used the may tech but wasn't mad on the short throw in the thumb control.

I'm currently using a second hand benchwheel remote and I really dig it. The only problem I see with it is that it has very light Springs, and it's easy to jam full throttle if you're not careful. However, the thumb throttle is the way I go, and I really dig them

Have u tried cutting the plastic for mini remote? It adds some possibility to water enter the case but it does increase throttle travel.. was one of the first things i did to the mini remote,

 second one i planned was installing mini volt meter but since batteries seem to last a long time never implemented it (though still see it as worthy not to carry extra set of batteries as a backup plan)

Some more extras would be to add slow / fast mode, heard it is possible with resistors (not 100% sure nano remote or enertion remote has it with resistors made possible)

using and will be always using 2.4ghz mini. 

tried the nano and maytech but not enough travel in the thumb controlled ones, as a result it's way too twitchy, especially braking at higher speeds

the smaller controllers are nice because they tuck away into ones pockets real easily but the lack of feel really kills it for me. 

also never had a single drop on the 2.4, despite the receiver being right next to the main power wires, and the sync is almost always instantaneous for me.

i thought we figured the 200 motor amps didn't go to 200 anyway and there's an internal limit at 120.  but I don't know and just ride whatever @evohyax set it at and think he's using the focboxes in here.
  the high motor amps likely does contribute as you say but programing for less power so you can handle it with a dinky remote is not what I want to do
what motor amps will the focbox do?

I have to agree with @joeadams101 moded gt2b for the win, small,compact,and reliable.
The mastercho mod is easy to install a gt2b in,no moving the charge port or anything like that just simply cut a bit of the pcb on one corner near the trigger to make it fit! <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/1/0/10f0617f8b64eeabdb38fd7125f4404dc1f713ec.jpg" width="690" height="388"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/f/9/f90cdb0cd9dc3d6d9af5dca3e44a685265d4a509.jpg" width="690" height="388"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/5/e/5efcaabf10436791bfa77c2ddbc51ff0cdb9655e.jpg" width="690" height="388">

There is no internal 120A limit.
Maybe just post your amp limit settings, the number of motors, firmware version, control mode and the throttle curve and then i can give my suggestions for a fine controllable power output.

And even more helpful would be a video with my app where we can see the realtime data values where you drive the way you want to drive. Then it would help a lot to fine tune it.

Setting the deadband so that you get the most usable movement without it twitching when the trigger vibrates is pretty key, aside from that can extend the trigger arm to turn the small degrees of change into a larger motion, with wheel designs just need a larger wheel to make more motion for the same turning, ultimately comes down to how big you're willing to make the remote.  I made the trigger area big enough I can squeeze two small fingers in there and easily push into braking or acceleration even with thin gloves on.

---

Literally have 100 of those green boards for sticking between the radio and arduino and for tapping out the ESC and potentiometer pins needed to get signals in and out of the arduino for acting as a transmitter and receiver.  I'm willing to get rid of them at cost plus shipping to anyone interested in making their own, PM me ( $2 for a board or $3 for a pair plus shipping )

---

Basically across the entire turning of the potentiometer (270 degrees) it goes through 1024 digital values (from 0-1023) when reading the analog to digital converted value (0-5V gets turned into 0-1023 the number).  If you can only move the potentiometer say 30 degrees out of the full 270 it's designed to turn then you only get 30/270 = .11 or 11% of the usable range so out of the 0-1023 you only use 113-114 values, so you really have 50 steps of positive throttle and 50 steps of negative throttle.  If you go lower angle change than that you get less usable resolution on the motion.

I have to say that what kind of board/riding style you practice makes a huge difference on what kind of transmitter you are holding.

I ride MTB on adverse off-road conditions and falling on my hands is likely on every outing.  So, apart from the trigger resolution, i.e. length of the trigger and sensitivity, I have to make sure that my finger never fits fully into the trigger position, meaning that I put my finger on the very tip of the trigger so in case of a fall, my finger does not trigger an accidental command as I am letting go of the transmitter.

I also want a cheap and easily replaceable transmitter as it will tend to stop working after a few falls, mainly due to the dust getting into the on/off switch.  I always have another transmitter as a spare, I go through them like cookies :slight_smile:
Worth $24 including shipping.

Hands down best remote I've used (when considering connection stability / dropouts and failsafes) is certainly Benchwheel (which uses awesome NRF24L01 daughter board). Ergonomics wise, Winning Nano v2 is well, a winner for me :) But I didn't find a perfect remote yet.

I highly recommend the GT2B in a master cho enclousure as your next remote. Its exactly what you are asking for. The mini 2.4 is a distant 2nd, but the rest of the remotes on the market just don't have enough throw to spread out the 120A your board is capable of.

the 2,4ghz mini right now for me,
had nano, and benchwheel aswell.

Nano was good if you wanted to end your life but not quite certain of how and when.

Benchwheel - best formfactor imo. But had 2 from a bad batch so wasnt a very pleasent experience if any at all. Waiting on new recievers tho. 

2,4ghz wins because of its realiability.

Found some inspiration from @jackw (correct me if Im wrong) who made a mode of the benchwheel to contain the 2,4ghz mini hardware. - that will most likely be the best remote whenever I get down to figuring that out ;)

I've used the mini remote and it was flawless. It was a bit awkward in my hand. The finger loop? throttle was too small. Sold it no regrets to a fellow Canuck. Now I'm using the gt2b remote in a master cho modded case as well as a nano-x. They have both been flawless. The nano-x is a bit small in my hand but not too bad and performs well. I can't remember if it came with a lanyard or not. I have one on it that is useless. if it did come with it??? The loop needs to be larger and adjustable.

I'd highly recommend 
- the mini remote. You can get it on banggood.com with free shipping for $15.83 Canadian dollars [skinamalinky](https://www.banggood.com/2_4GHz-Radio-Remote-Controller-Receiver-Transmitter-For-Electric-Skateboard-p-1125575.html?rmmds=search)
- gt2b from amazon or hobbyking with master cho chozen , badwolf, mad monkey and sparkle mods
- the nano-x. My only gripe is you have to calibrate every time you turn it on.

Using the nano v2 at the moment for my mini cruiser, it is decent and fits in my pocket.
On the other boards I am using a benchwheel remote. Played around with other springs and now I really dig it. Still compact, comfortable to hold, no drop outs ever and I like the throttel curve with it.

It seems from what @wafflejock says that we aren't using nearly the amount of data that the potentiometers could produce.  I forget what his numbers were but think we use like  11% of the potentiometer.   
With the mini which I use daily I can feel almost always the rachetting between positions where I have a gap between maybe 4 and 6 amps current to the motor.  It's like I'm constantly twit hing back and forth unbalanced. If the remote were to fully utilize the full travell of the potentiometer I'd have like 10 more levels of current. ..4.2, 4.6, 5,...or something like that, and things would be smooth.  All the remotes suck!

Yeah sorry didn't mean to make a big deal of that I just thought about it and messed with my own one quite a bit.  I don't think the range that we move the potentiometer or the 50 up and 50 down is really that bad a resolution for what we're doing here think it is more about the travel for your finger and not being able to really accurately position your finger where you want to while bouncing around.  Like you said you could gear (or possibly just offset with a resistor) the trigger so it turns the knob more but ultimately the sensitivity I think is mostly based on how accurately you can control your finger.  Another thing to think about is if the potentiometer moves 270 degrees total and that's 1024 value changes then we get a value change at every .26 degrees (270/1024) of change, with a trigger "radius" of say 5cm that would mean ( (5cm *2) * 3.14159 * (.26/360) ) = .02cm or .2mm )

I still have yet to try a trigger style remote but it just seems like a bad idea. It seems to easy to twitch or pull throttle if you get off balance and could lead to falling. I guess I need to try it first but boosted boards remote is king in my opinion. Way more movement that the mini 2.4 remotes with the thumbwheels. 

There is a guy making an orange one that looks just like boosted but has an aduino inside. Looks like the holy grail to me :stuck_out_tongue:

Solid Geeks is a nice design for sure too.  I never used the thumbwheels so I didn't go that route with my own, just used to the RC car style trigger remotes.  The thumbwheel seems worse to me really since your thumb is just "dumber" in my opinion or less sensitive than your trigger finger but maybe that's not true for everyone (my thumb is a big dumb implement good for high pressure low sensitive stuff IMO).

---

I understand the finger trigger style does have a higher chance of getting pushed while bouncing/shaking around too though so could see the other side.

Any idea if the mod would fit this one? It's actually been pretty solid. I had to use it after my mini randomly stopped pairing. Now that I think about it, the mini needed to be repaired randomly even before it finally wouldn't pair.

I started off with a huge RC one like this but on 27 or 37MHz instead of 2.4Ghz so had a huge antenna and sucked AA batteries down daily that's why I ended up going the DIY route.

That said I also went back and gutted the original remote and put my own transmitter/receiver stuff in there (power amplified nrf chip can control my rc car from over a block away further than I can see it to control it), since the premade shells are nice despite being big.  The components are all dirt cheap, nrf boards are a dollar or two a piece, the arduino pro mini 3.3V are around $5 a piece (you need 2 of each one for transmitter one for receiver) only down side I see with the DIY remotes is the time it takes to assemble and calibrate it yourself.

I had one of those smaller ones you linked too can't recall what the issue was with that one but I only used it for a short time before switching to printing my own.

As you can see the DIY ones are easier to pocket for sure :)  but again obvious time investment vs just buying something off the shelf.

If your looking for a new one any way, I love my GT2b it has a rechargeable battery. This case I designed required no modification other snipping the trigger rod a bit shorter. 

I will release the file shortly i am printing hopefully my final copy through Shapeways now. 
I have been using this hand finished prototype for months and it is amazing.

You can get the GT2B($25-$28) 3d printed housing on eBay for like $25. The FlySky GT2B remote has a solid connection. Transplanting, cutting and two tiny soldering took under an hour. The hardest part was trimming the plastic on the trigger mechanism and the pcb. Hard because I did this at 1 am and didn’t want to use the noisy Dremel. Makes a great chunky RC remote into a pocketable remote with a solid feel and good ergonomics. Best $50 remote thus far.

Mad Munkey GT2b Mod.  The ergonomics are great and is small.  I should print one of the Mastercho cases to compare ergonomics, but I have no complaints with mine.

I just put together the GT2B ($28.99) with the MasterCho 3D printed case ($28.50) Total was $57.49. If you don't feel comfortable doing this mod but want to use this, I'm willing to do it for you for $2.51 just to make it an even $60 cost. I can ship it for free from my office.

After testing this remote out with my own build, I notice one great thing. There's plenty of travel on the trigger that the Mini didn't have, which in turn gave more throttle control.

that is the deal of deals!  Will the remote work for lefties?  @Sapphirinia sounds like you could have a damn good working part here at least.  I think your history on this site has been a story of failure from the start more than any other person.

It’s actually not bad in my left hand. That top curvature of the battery hump feels good with my right thumb. In the left the index finger rests in that spot. I’m actually looking into making more to replace a mini and a nano-x as well.

It’s a really easy mod. Just cut wire. Two tiny solder. And trim away plastic. I’ll post video once the remote and case comes in. If after that you still think it’s too hard I’ll do one for you basically at cost if you live in the states....also I’ll probably sell my Nano-x after the next mod replaces it

I was just talking to a representative from Enertion's website asking about the Nano-X remote which is currently on sale, and I asked if there is a way to order an extra transmitter since I'll be using 2 VESC's to power my Carvon V4's, and they said no, but I could buy 2 since they're on sale!  So... they said they will work with any transmitters as long as their on the right frequency, but I don't know where to find just a transmitter, without having to buy a remote with it.  Do you guys know of any places that sell just transmitters, or how do you get your Carvon V4's to work with 2 VESC's? Is it possible to use just one transmitter? I eventually plan on getting another set of V4's and going 4WD, so I'll need 4 VESC's, so I will need 4 transmitters then! I'm not buying 4 remotes to get 4 transmitters and have 3 spare remotes... I can see getting 2 and having a spare remote if one breaks, but I'd rather just buy 1 remote, and separately buy transmitters for the remote.  Any suggestions?  What do you all work Carvon setups use / do?

you only need one receiver.  you can connect it to the master vesc and connect the vescs together with canbus.  or use a splitter off the receiver.  easier to do the canbus I think

With the canbus setup though don't I have to then designate one like master and one slave and some other stuff?  I was under the impression this was kinda difficult..?

making one master and one slave is easy.  

the vesc has a plug to connect 2 vescs together...for 4....maybe you could splice it don't know.   but surely you can use one receiver.

So I have a mini remote but some how my vesc is recognizing the wheel as throttle and the trigger as nothing? Anyone have this happen before and how should I fix it (besides flipping the wires cause that requires accurate soldering and im not that good)?
Thanks,

If you are using a dual set up and splitting the receiver between just plug into a different channel and bind your remote again. Mine was doing the same when I first bought it

Its a bluetooth remote controler with lots of buttons...
I would love to know if it is useable or not?
Its similar to the wii nunchak remote.![20181005_023502_Richtone(HDR)|690x388](upload://w5qzsntEzacm6KTzcT7JWztKXYb.jpeg) ![20181005_023514_Richtone(HDR)|690x388](upload://tRgtiO7RNvMkk6CubG7NYghaAeU.jpeg)

If it uses Bluetooth as a connection I'd stay away. Bluetooth does not have as reliable connection as 2.4hz signal. You don't want to loose connection while you are riding

NOthing trumps the gt2b or gt2e or any of the regular, big rc 2,4ghz remote controllers. They are so much better that is what I use... I could have a leight and small remote no one would see, yet I ride with a big and heavy remote... The reason should be obvious... Thumb control does not and will not have enough travel distance. Try to see how far you can move your thumb vs how far you can move your point finger you control pistol like remotes... That immediately tells you one needs a pistol like remote and not a thumb control If you want more travel... WHich you do for a DIY or a high out put board. These are remotes with the best travel there is and are so much better than any thumb control stick... though they still don't come close to gt2e/2b etc... and thos are APS remote, https://www.google.cz/search?q=chinese+eskating+remote&client=opera&hs=SWe&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjBoqm4x5_gAhUJUlAKHcvkCp0Q_AUIDigB&biw=1920&bih=980#imgrc=CbRy9mt6wdHQ6M: and this chinese one, which is actually very good being it a chinese cheap remote. https://www.google.cz/search?client=opera&hs=BrJ&biw=1920&bih=980&tbm=isch&sa=1&ei=nt1WXNbtMcWlwQLruJ3ABw&q=electric+skate+remote+pistol+like&oq=electric+skate+remote+pistol+like&gs_l=img.3...47542.51942..52029...0.0..0.55.1429.33......0....1..gws-wiz-img.......0j0i67j0i30j0i10i19j0i19j0i30i19j0i8i30i19j0i8i30.u3BjGRclnFA#imgrc=3lQmygYFMxPMiM:   But the main point is, you want a pistol, not a thumb.  The only reason, almost, we change modes on our boards is because of shitty remotes. If you get a good controller you can have your board set to maximum output for crazy racing and still lend it to a 8 year old child and the child will be able to ride and accelerate like an old grandma... Even with having all that power in the trigger.  I have lent an equivalent of ENertion Raptor in full output to 10 year old kids that could barely ride... No problem... YOu do that with the Raptor and the thumb remote and see what happens.
