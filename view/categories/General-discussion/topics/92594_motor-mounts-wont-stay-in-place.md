I have a custom build that so far - despite Flipsky having bad information on their site not informing the buyer that one particular FSESC 6 does not support 4WD, you have to buy the "plus" version, when I called him on it I was ignored and out $600 , so ruined my 4WD goal - has turned out relatively well. The big problem I am having is I can not get the motor mounts to stay put. I have even drilled 3, yes 3, set screw holes through the mount and through the axle of the truck. I'm using [these mounts](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07FD1K9Z1/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_image_o09_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) with [these trucks](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B078HHLW3Y/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o05_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1). I took the hanger and placed it in a drill press and rotated it against sand paper until it was as close to round as I could get with a dial caliper and magnet mount. I forget who suggested it in a post but it was a member of this forum.

I have tightened down the clamp as far as I can get it to without stripping the hex bolt head. It's so tight it has flattened the aluminum clamps "jagged edges" from the pressure against the trucks. Still it slips. What is frustrating me to no end is that I have loctited (blue) in 4mm set screws, 3 on each axle. When those loosened I tapped them and replaced it with helicoil. That worked for about a half mile before they came loose again.

WtF am I doing wrong? With all the extra safeguards this should not be an issue...$2000 custom board...useless

Those mounts are garbage, and those trucks have hangers that are not really ideal for Esk8.

It's just not a very good mount my friend. You just need to swap out to something like an evolve DKP and use an aftermarket mount from one of our members here.

Oof, yeah. Those mounts are already suspect enough as they are. But it looks like they're specifically made for paris trucks, which have a nice round and most importantly NOT tapered hangar. It seems like a bad combination between mount and hangar, that thing will never stay put.

I use the double kingpin gullwings because they allow my board to still turn in a decent radius while having the kingpin nuts tightened way down so I am stable at high speeds. I don't know why people bag on the trucks for being unstable at high speeds if you tighten the nut down enough, but anyways...

I wish I could find the post again because I don't remember the outcome of the project for that person who posted it, I only remember, and it might have even been psycotiller maybe but don't quote me on that, that suggestion to use a file and drill press to round out the truck axle to accept round mounts. It wouldn't surprise me if I did it wrong but to the eyeball and dial caliper the axle is as round as it's going to be - minus the very small area where the axle is concave and not in contact with the....fuck me...is that my problem? I could have sworn it was only one "spikey" point that wasn't contacting the axle, I hope it's not more than that. Shit. Will update.

The Evolve DKP is what I was modeling after. I haven't reached out to evolve myself but have read from other sources that they won't sell individual parts such as those unless you have purchased a board from them. Which is strange because I have read in other places that you have top send the entire board in to have it serviced (which is inline with my experience with Acton and Haloboard).

Absent of either case do you or anyone else know how to get my hands on a rear (assuming it's different from the front) 185mm evolve truck?

I didn't get to make the quad build, Flipsky sold me the wrong FSESC 6.6 and I can't return or exchange it (even though their own website fails to point out that you must buy the "plus" version of this VESC to make a 4WD setup) for the right one. So I have settled on a 2WD version, which when the mounts are tightly secured the thing rips pretty well, but I do try to avoid as much hard accelerating and do as little braking, even light braking, as possible to avoid the extreme forces being imparted to the set screws (since the clamp obviously isn't holding it in place).

Chaka - I'll try to upload pics of the board here when I get home shortly.

If you use those DKPs and that mount, just weld it like back in the old days before we had so many truck and mount options. 

But in all honesty those trucks are hard to find good mounts for since the hanger is practically round. SurfRods are rectangular so press on mounts won't budge, e-caliber and TorqueBoard 218s are flat on three sides so once the grub screw is tighten they don't move.

As far as the "hate" of those DKP due to stability, you are only stable up to a certain point no matter how tight you have set it. I do like DKP's turning radius but they will never reach the speed and stability of single king pin trucks. I have them on a board that only goes 22mph max.

Evolve will sell you Jeffs mother if you gave them the right price.  All parts are available on the site for anyone but be warned the evolve trucks will not be as stable at speed as the gullwings unless you upgrade the bushings.  Gullwings are a far superior product but crap for esk8.  @marcmt88 has mounts for evolve trucks and 6374 motors.  One other thing if you use the rear truck with the welded mount you will have to source 10mm bearings for the pulleys because they have a stepped axle.  8mm to 10mm.  Or you could use 2 front trucks and source a clamp to fit from here

drill the mount and thread it. Install a jam bolt and put a divot on the truck? Theyre round so youre gonna need to key them. if the mount was steel and the trucks were aluminum youd have a chance with tightening only

Also you should never use round trucks for esk8.  You have no choice but to find someone who can weld aluminum, or change your trucks.  They will never stay tight for any length of time and will always come loose again.

This thread is 23 comments long. I did.

I'm pointing out that these are not a good selection for trucks.

They're SO not round that I'm convinced that you cannot get it good enough without using a lathe.

![IMG_20190503_121903|690x433](upload://9ZKVv2m4waS3Sea9MUyjBrvAlL5.jpeg) 

And this picture pretty much confirms what I thought.

Not being a troll.

You've got three options really.

- Weld your mounts on

- buy new mounts and trucks

- live with them always getting loose.

How to be kchxaz:

Step 1) Buy cheap shit that literally everyone recommend against to prove a point.

Step 2) Whine, refuse feedback, and get defensive when called out for buying cheap shit and expecting them to work well.

Thank you for providing useful feedback. I had originally wanted to use a lathe however I am nothing close to a machinist and I don't know anyone who is, let alone have access to one. However considering the task was as simple as it comes with regards to machining parts I considered briefly buying the mini lathe sold at Harbor Freight but with all the questionable reviews and the fact that the 10" truck wouldn't fit the bed (I went to HF w my truck and placed it in the display model) despite it claiming to be a 12" lathe, I came to the conclusion it wasn't worth it seeing as you also need to spend about another 1/3 cost of the lathe for tooling.

Anyways, I like your idea of welding the clamps in place but unfortunately, while I do know a girl who is a pretty good welder, I do believe the trucks are magnesium (please someone correct me if I am wrong)  and the clamps are aluminum. You can't weld magnesium firstly it'll catch fire, and secondly you can't weld dislike metals without some serious know how and specialized equipment, I think...

Which leaves me with the last option: try new mounts...One member suggested mounts from psychotiller but the link is dead - I don't think he sells them anymore. I've tried mounts from Boardnamics; DIYE; and another 3rd party I can't remember the name of right now. I'm open to other suggestions.....

There's potential for brazing if you know anyone with the right gear. That girl with the welder is probably more experienced with it than I am.

thats your problem right there.

best case scenario is use @psychotiller mounts, I forget what they are called, but it's a cup, and mill the hangers to shape. I did it with a set of Paris 195's 2 years ago and they are still tight.

If you want better trucks, get Surf Rodz and then talk to @psychotiller about which type of motor mounts you need.

The real solution to this is cone tipped setscrews, and drill a very shallow hole where the setscrew creates a dimple. Done it before on paris trucks, worked like a charm. However it did eventually wear out the hole, but my setscrews were too small.

Theres not a motor mount clamp that doesn't come loose after miles and miles of riding if its a clamp set up.  Its a toss up between loctiting it on so you can never move it again or using softer compounds and knowing you may have to get it off one day.  Round hanger profiles require the former approach and so therefore are not the answer.  One flat plane is all you need.

Never needed the green but the red 680 does the job.  Again blow torch to get off but holds like a weld.  Its an actual retaining compound though not a thread locker.  Is the green the same?

Yes, both 648 and 680 are retaining compounds. 680 is green too. Does it come in red down under?

648 is stronger than 680 and can also withstand higher temperatures but I think 680 can handle bigger gaps so it may be better if the fit is loose.

First time I used 648 was when an RC helicopter I had only came with a small bottle of 648 to install the motor pinion gear. I refused to believe I would have to put a $2000 bird on the air with only a small dab of loctite keeping it there but there were no grub screws or keyways of any short.

Yeah its red here. One of my pulleys has been holding with just that.  No key no grub screw.  The other does have a grub because I didn't believe people.  The one without has been like it for a bit because the screw has completely backed out and disappeared. Its filled the shaft flat spot entirely and bonded the round.  Locked solid.

 I used a high temp 648 equivalent for my 2 inch wheel spacers on my 4wd so I guess I rely on this stuff quite heavily and in the most consequential situations.  Amazing stuff.

Are you sure? Loctite Australia website says it is green.

Daren, be honest. Have you been drinking again? (I mean more than usual)

Did I mention its not loctite?  No  should have lol
Its a permatex equivalent.  I have 20 bottles of loctite in my garage and I'm old and get confused.
The local auto shop has a nice little chart that matches their products with loctite brand.  Sorry.  Oh and the permatex is fucking red.  I promise.  Unless I've got colour blindness to add to my failing senses.  Seen quite a few accidents on traffic signals lately by some strange coincidence....:thinking:

If you have the right tools nothing is tough. Mapp gas torch and off the pulley goes.

Anything less will simply not work.

I can't have torches in a high-rise apartment.  I just got two pulleys off with 290, with a heat gun and a pulley remover.  They wouldn't budge until after they were 290 degrees (143C) or above.

Course you can.  You're the man of the house.  Everyman needs a blowtorch.

LOL! Yes, I know. I bought the enclosure before the deck or battery. It houses a 12s5p flat pack (including BMS, circuit breaker for on/off switch, switches for my safety lightand it's a very tight fit. As you can obviously see the enclosure is not long enough to begin with but it's the longest I could find anywhere including Psychotillers - it's actually one of his. Once I do enough research and have a couple hundo extra to spare I am going to buy some carbon fiber (and the additional items required to form the CF) and take a stab at making my own.

Andy87 - 12s5p; samsung 30Q; 560mm x 138mm x 32mm Flat pack (actually a true flat pack is only 23mm instead of 32 I believe). It is a monster of a battery but I can ride a 10 mile daily commute (5mi each direction) twice and then some, before needing juice again. As far as top speed, I still have the remote on beginner mode and have yet to max the throttle. Haven't ridden it in expert mode other than to test the acceleration and that was too much for me. Mind you I have/had a Haloboard 22mph(until I got nailed by a hit n run driver) and a 4WD Qu4tro (Acton) 27mph and I had no problem running both of those at max throttle on expert all day long.

The board I built here blows the two of those away. No comparison. If I could get these damn mounts to stay in place without having to tighten them every mile then I would be living very nicely. I love this board.

Well, I'm sure that's way too much more than you were looking for in an answer...hope it helped anyways
