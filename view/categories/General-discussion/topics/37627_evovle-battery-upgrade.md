@longhairedboy Unless they don't know that you need to use the BMS it comes with.

i know for sure they made many packs already and it work very well.
no issues at all, they also use the original genuine bms from evolve.

Then you should show photos of the BMS, and maybe say that on your site.  Instead of leaving folks to guess.

25A sounds too low, and 50A burst sounds too low also considering the stock one is 60A.

I'm with @longhairedboy I smell something decidedly nautical...

No mention of any board modification required to actually fit the batteries in your board! Lol. That'd be a bit of a shock!

I find it hard to believe that they're using the exact same BMS that evolve use, considering how protective evolve are about their innards. They might have connections with the factory that supply evolve though...
