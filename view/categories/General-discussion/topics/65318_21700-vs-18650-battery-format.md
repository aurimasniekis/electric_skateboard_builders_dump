I recently watched a thread that started about how the future of Lithium cells was 21700 format cells. It then completely digressed into a debate about how to calculate volumes and percentages. It got so bad that it was soon closed down due to it being totally non constructive. I'm not trying to restart that thread to create another pointless debate but wanted to point out that it doesn't matter what size you choose they are all Li-ion cells with the same active materials. Yes there are different combinations of chemicals for different properties and preferences by different manufacturers but the size of the can doesn't alter the chemistry. Therefore it boils down to what size cell you can fit into your enclosure to get the voltage you need and the highest Amp hours you can. The newer formats do tend to be more expensive per w/h but this is usually due to manufacturing costs. 18650's are the cheapest because they are mass produced, the other sizes will change in price as more and more are produced. 
In theory a larger can format will have higher energy to total volume  due to the fact that there is more active material to can material compared to a smaller can size, the increase though is very small.
We have had different size Alkaline batteries for years, AAA,AA,C and D people don't say "D cells are better than C cells" Yes they have more energy but that's obvious because they are bigger. If your torch doesn't fit D cells then the argument is mute. Same applies to 18650 vs 21700.

I agree, I chose Samsung 30Q because they have a pink wrapper.

Does anyone know what the best kind of motor oil I should put in my car?

Well confused with that one? We are talking about 21700 vs 18650 Li-ion cells and you put up specs for 26650 and 18650 LiFePO4 cells which are completely different chemistry.

It's a side by side comparison of a123's lifepo cells, in their 21700 format (which boosted uses) and 18650 format. Same chemistry, same manufacturer, different format

Ok I see. The 26650 cell is quite a bit bigger than an 18650 cell. These two one is 76g and the other 39g almost twice the size.(weight) But yes as you get bigger the power density increases, in this case from 2.947W/g compared to 2.4615W/g.

A123 don't manufacture 21700 cells, Boosted do not use 21700 cells because they use A123 cells and they don't manufacture 21700 cells.

26650 is not 21700 (quite a big difference)

Please don't get this started again. Not all 21700 have a higher energy density than 18650 just like there are 18650 with various capacities out there. Right now top of the line cells in both formats are VERY close in their density so there is not really a difference between them besides the size USUALLY favoring 18650 (as you reach the desired S count in less space).

Advantages of 21700 are high current capabilities (just like top of the line 18650) and high cycle life. Downsides are price and their size and weight.

Now everybody needs to decide for themselves what compromise they want to make. In 5 years when 21700 have become like half the price and have higher capacities than today we all might switch to 21700 but until then 18650 are the better choice most of the time.

So I did the calculations in the old thread on the samsung 40t vs 30q.

https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/anyone-who-brings-up-21700-batteries-gets-roasted-but-why/65249/45?u=cryo

And what I found was that the 18650 packed more kWh **by volume AND weight**. Maxid also discovered that you pay less per kWh with the 18650. What that means is if size/space constraint AND cost is important to you, the 18650 format is best for you. You get more "bang for your buck" so to say.

However, while you get better cost/space concerns with the 18650, the 21700 still has more raw energy, just due to its bigger size. Also, they generally have a higher continuous discharge rate which is important for high drain application like esk8.

No one was saying its wrong to use 21700s, for some who have a ginormous enclosure and money to blow and need the most range they can get, they are absolutely the best choice. We were saying it was wrong to choose them if you wanted the most energy for every dollar/inch in your enclosure, which the original poster of the previous thread contested... and that led to the consequent shitshow.

Maybe there is a 21700 out there that beats out the 30q on space/money. I just went with the 40t for the comparison because that was what seemed like the best performing one on mooches battery test linked in the old thread.

No one knows your build better than yourself so you have to do your own research and decide...

The tesla 2170 cell may be great... may be just anouther 21700. I dont hink anyone has tested it yet publicly, at least not that i have seen... and to the OP... you obv didnt read the whole closed thread, or any thread on this subject....Unless you really need the amps, or just like spending more money on cells, the 30q is tops on kWh in volume and weight when compared. At least to the 40t. As that is what was brought up.

Milwaukee tools used the 18650 cells for years in there M18,18 volt line. They recently started using 21700 cells in their High Output battery packs. There are three differences. **1)** the new packs are wider, but still fit all of their tools. 
**2)** Even the smallest capacity new battery (the one layer 3.0CP - 3 Ah) can easily power the highest current draw tools. This is the reason for the "High Output" designation. **3)** New is almost always more expensive. This is also the case here.

Now back to the subject at hand, the difference between 18650 and 21700 cells. The 18650 cells are 18 x 65 mm, and the 21700 cells are 21 x 70 mm. To keep things fair, let's discus these batteries as though they used the same formula, so that we can compare apples to  apples. The larger size of the 21700 cells has a few advantages.  
**1)** 21700 packs are safer and more reliable because a battery with a wider pathway between electrodes, can handle more current. Using this larger cell, we don't have to worry as much about the pack overheating in high draw conditions. Cool running batteries last longer 
 
**2)** A battery with more density between electrodes, can hold more energy. On all same sizes batteries, the higher the Ah rating, the lower the current rating. On the smaller batteries, you have to ether chose between capacity or current, or find a way around this problem. The "work around" favored by most pack manufacturers, is to wire more than one layer of cells in parallel. Volts add in series, Amps and Ah add in parallel. Using 21700 cells, to build a similar pack often takes less cells and less complexity.

**3)** Milwaukee makes 7, 18650 cell packs and 4, 21700 cell packs. There is very little size and weight difference between 18650 and 21700 packs of similar storage capacities, but the ones with 21700 cells do have a superior current handling capacity.

I choose Milwaukee M18 tool batteries as a platform in order to give real world examples. The same rules apply to building a skateboard pack.

The chart on top use pounds for weight, and inches for the dimensions.

The second diagram shows how layering works. Volts add in series, Amps and Ah add in parallel. Layering is a great way to get more Amps and Ah out of a battery pack. 

I use to race 1/8th scale RC trucks. A stock motor pulls over 100 Amps starting off and coming out of corners. Don't under estimate these small motors, high loads can draw some serious amps. Build packs that can easily handle what you ask of them.

Thanks for the input but I actually think this is mostly common knowledge at this point in time. 

Most high end builds here are running 12S4P 30Q packs and above. In terms of current/capacity/weight, the extra space occupied by larger cells offsets the benefits incurred. In short, battery chemistry is the limitation here and the dollar cost per performance is in equilibrium these days. In some cases moving to larger sized cells may be beneficial due to enclosure limitations but the same can be said for smaller sizing as well.

Thanks for the reply. I found this thread in Google, and for me, it came up short. Batteries have been around for a long time, and the rules have not changed. It may be common knowledge to you now, as it was to others several years ago. My point is, a new group comes into school, as another group leaves.

12S4P 30Q packs are expensive, and the ones I saw use 18650 cells. Do you think that this pack would benefit from a cell that runs cooler and longer, and is more reliable? At this point in our technology, the 12S4P 30Q pack you use is an antique.

What voltages were these packs running at? 100A@7.2v=720w whereas 80A@44.4v= 3552w (in the case of the 30Q 12S4P pack). So a completely different league in terms of power output.

What "non-antique" cells are comparable to the Samsung 30Q in terms of discharge capability, capacity and cost? They really do seem like a good balance, hence their popularity with builders.

You make it sound so simple, numbers are a good start. I also fly RC prop powered jets. Take a look at those battery's (flat packs).
https://hobbyking.com/en_us/batteries-chargers/batteries/lipo.html
The only reason they still use 18650 cells is the cost of retooling. 18650 cells are OK and work acceptable, but the 21700 is unquestionably a better cell. And the weight and size difference are no problem for a skate board.

I'm sorry but you are completely wrong. I fly race quads from a 65mm prop to 5" and I esk8 with battery that I built myself. Flying a quad or a plane and riding a skateboard are very different things.

It seems you are quite literally comparing LiPo to Li-Ion and have no understanding of the chemistry as well as the advantages and disadvantages of them both. I highly suggest you google them before responding further or using the search function on these forums.

I don't need to look it up. Skateboards consistently draw high loads, RC planes and vehicles draw high loads in burst. In RC planes, there is an art to choosing the right battery. To have a warm battery at the end of a flight, you need a balance of overall weight, speed, motor, aerodynamics, flight duration, along with how often and hard the pilot turns the aircraft (too many to list all). A Skateboard's batteries largest restraint is load. The higher the voltage, the less Amps are needed to do the same amount of work. The one you talked about uses 43 volts, 60 18650 cells in two layers. I believe you would need only one layer of 21700 cells, and take a small reduction on the Ah rating. 

Lithium-Ion, Nickel-metal hydride, Nickel-Cadmium, Lead-acid, Alkaline, I don't care. You can power a Skateboard with any type of battery you want. Each has their advantages and disadvantages. Some may favor a different motor (voltage & specs). Layer technology lets you use 18650 cells; this technology can be used in any pack. The best scenario is to build a pack that will easily fit on a skateboard, but belt and back packs have been used in the past. Commercial configurations are always a compromise. If you've got the money, there are always better choices available.

Energy density is close, price of a newer cell will be higher while it's new, but the 21700 cells have superior current handling capacity, and will be more reliable because the packs can be built simpler and run cooler. I'm not saying that 18650 cells are junk. Milwaukee M18 5Ah batteries are $53 at Amazon, so I bought two. A month ago, the same battery was $85. So out goes the old, and in comes the new. The M18 5Ah are old tech, but are still great batteries for most tools. And I can use them in my saws, but they get a little too warm if I run them consistently.

And Friskies; I'd like to be able to agree with you and say the 12S4P 30Q pack is the best all around choice. but its not. Its only superior traits are that they are tucked neatly under the board, and the ride last a while (25-30 miles). But lets see you ride this board down a rail. The choices we make are relative. Can you imagine 21700 cells inside the board. It wont travel as far, but it will be lite and thin enough to where you can still do some tricks, Wouldn't it be nice to do more than just go for a ride. Or maybe I'm wrong, a 12S4P 30Q pack skateboard may not be as fragile and heavy as it appears.

21700 cells don't run cooler, they run hotter because they have less surface area to capacity. It is one their fundamental downsides.

You lost me. The 18650 cells are 18 x 65 mm, and the 21700 cells are 21 x 70 mm. 21mm is a larger diameter than 18mm. In the same formula, more length increases storage capacity, and a larger diameter increases storage and current capacity. Given that the 21700 cell are newer, the formula used will be the newer and more advanced of the two. But like wire of the same type; the larger the diameter, the higher the current capacity. "How hot a battery gets" is directly related to how often, how long, and how close you get to its current capacity. This is why a larger diameter cell will run cooler. Storage capacity and heat are not directly related. I repair navigation systems in jets (all the way down to the circuit board); I know a thing or two about electricity.

@LukeCool  If you're wondering why people seem hostile it's because your tone sounds like you are presenting yourself as an expert in something where you have not done enough research. This creates misinformation on a forum intended to provide accurate information to builders and so people want to discredit what you are saying so as not to mislead our users. That said we all could do a better job being more polite to each other, state facts and explain (cite sources is even better) rather than telling people they are dumb and to use the search function (I know it takes extra effort and time). 

There's lots of number crunching done by the members of this forum that show dollar per Wh, power density and energy density of 30q packs sit at a really happy equilibrium. Especially when you consider the prices of cells that consumers can easily access. 

The main argument for diy pack 21700 is compartmentalized enclosures on some emtb's etc. that could fit either a row of 21700 or 18650 cells can get more range, and also a lower number of required cells means slightly less work welding (maybe). Otherwise the 30q just makes more sense. Calling it an "antique" is just inaccurate, they are all still leveraging the same basic chemistry and changing the dimensions of the cannisters slightly isn't some amazing new generation of battery technology. Granted it's quite a feat in terms of infrastructure to manufacture.

Until the price per Wh of 21700s drop they aren't really worth attention except with certain enclosure dimensions or if you don't care as much about cost.

I agree with almost every thing you said. People seem hostile because they're passionate about there belief's. But I don't mind; more is learned when we actually have to think things through. And 18650 cells being more bang for the buck is another point I have repeated several times. We can also agree that "antique” is an overstatement, 18650 cells are widely used for good reason.The 30q pack uses 43 volts, 60 18650 cells. 60 times 1.2 volts is equal 72 volts. If used in two layers, the pack would be 36 volts. I'd love to see a schematic for this pack, this makes no sense to me. I am an expert in some aspects, but like everyone else, my education does have some holes in it. If I'm wrong, please school me, I'm egger to learn. 

And also no, I've "never ridden a direct drive at 10 miles per hour"; but I've build motors from scratch, and repaired more than I can count. The motors in bikes that do the same thing are big. The size restraint of a skateboard has to demand compromises. So the higher performance the motor, the more human help it will need to keep it at a reasonable temperature. This little motor is often moving well over 100 pounds. Few 50 pound kids can afford a skateboard like this. 

I do admit that this is reasoning conjecture on my part, NOT skateboard experience. But none of this is hard to figure out. Heat is a biproduct of the resistance of work, tempered by how close and how often we visit the top end of the specs.

Very interesting, thanks for the post. 

I'd expect the voltage to stay fairly consistent. With that current draw, this is a pretty nice rig. A skate board graph should look similar, only much smoother less dramatic peeks. Do you have one you could show us?

Ill try to explain. My point is that a pack constructed of 18650 cells will run cooler than one of 21700 cells, even if the chemistry and construction is identical (same energy and power density). This is because 18650 cells have a higher surface area to capacity ratio. This is similar to the way that a mouse requires high metabolism/weight to maintain it's body temperature than an elephant.

Of course it is not possible to build two such packs, because Samsung does not make a "30Q+" in 21700 size. 

You have a fundamental misunderstanding of the way in which these types of battery packs should be analysed. It's true as you say in this post that the larger 21700 cells will have higher capacity and power, but of course they do. It's the equivalent of me saying my 100kg 300Ah lead acid battery will run cooler than an 18650, its larger and heavier. However it will not run cooler than an equivalent (capacity/weight/size) 18650 based pack.

If you build two identical packs, not identical in the number of cells obviously, but in the capacity. Maybe you end up with 10s5p(18650) and 10s4p(21700). The packs have identical power capability and energy. The 18650 pack will run cooler because it has higher surface area and will therefore conduct heat away more easily.

There are a lot of people on these forums who are far more qualified than you. My advice is that if someone disagrees with you about something you have relatively little experience in, assume you are wrong and politely ask them to clarify.

The 30q pack uses 43 volts, 60 18650 cells. 60 times 1.2 volts is equal 72 volts. If used in two layers, the pack would be 36 volts.

I am sorry but this sentence has disqualified you for giving any advice about liion cells currently. You should have at least the basics down - like that a 18650 cell has a nominal voltage of 3.6V and is not like a AA battery.

If you consider one cell in free air? Sure. Lots of cells glued to each other inside a enclosure that in most cases is made of a material with low thermal conductivity? Not so much difference

Using words like "not so much" isn't very specific. Back of the envelope comparing two rectangular enclosures each containing an equal cell volume. So comparing the surface area of the battery enclosures in common eskate form factor.

18650 -> 10s6p -> 2 x 30 cells = 1645cm2
21700 -> 10s4p -> 2x20 cells = 1411cm2

So the 18650 enclosure has 16% more surface area. Maybe that is not so much, but my point STILL stands. An 18650 based battery pack will run cooler than 21700.

I have limited width on my board that I can't go for 5P 18650 cells, but I can go for 4P 21700. Now there is a clear advantage of using 21700 in keeping it simple yet packing in a lot of capacity.

Of course Your right, but that's why I ask to see a schematic for this pack. I'm on 60 hour shifts at work right now.

 12cells X 3.6 Volts = 43.2 volts, and a 60cell pack divided by 12cells = 5 layers . So that pack is 5 layers @ 12 cells per layer. This explains the high amp rating.

Taz; thanks for posting the graph. I see the skateboard's max current is about 70Amps, but this high is rare, where as 10 to 30 Amps is fairly common. An RC helicopter is a bit different than RC planes and ground based vehicles. Both can glide and use little to no current … a lot like your skateboard. If this was what you're trying to prove, you succeeded.

we have a scheme to describe packs like this: 12S5P
It gives you the number of cells in series (in this case 12) as well as the number of cells in parallel (in this case 5).
Other typical configurations are 10S3P, 13S4P and so on.
You can find plenty of schematics for these configurations in the battery build threads
