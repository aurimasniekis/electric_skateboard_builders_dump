another computer image and a lot of magical talk.  Not a single real part.  

a solar panel isn't going to be able to do much charging.  

gets you cynical at this point.

No one's brought up the whole "the deck IS the battery" thing.. Super cool concept.  Whether it's true or not we'll see but cool concept

He's definitely using VESC's to drive the hubs. You can see it in the render.

the board being a battery is an awesome idea and I'd love to see it.   I'd like to see even a "homemade" version.  the details on how it'd be done would be great to see.  It screams danger.

Seems great but 60MPH? Seems like a little much, also the fan seems a bit sketchy. Also I am skeptical of the fact that they didn't show a single real part as @Hummie mentioned.

Looks a lot like an engineering student that has a bunch of great ideas and nothing tangible.
Personally I hate the futuristic boards made out of carbon fiber and metal and what not. I made my first long board a decade before I found out about esk8s, and I think if you lose that feeling of a chill cruise on a long board, well then I'd rather just walk. 
Also this board would cost like $3000.

IÂ´m sure F1 gets jealous now.
maybe he can REVERSE the computer fan and make the board hover. (no need for wheels anymore)
seriously: to suck the board to the ground that fan must be HUUUUUGE!!!
and then, you need a fan on your shoes too.
