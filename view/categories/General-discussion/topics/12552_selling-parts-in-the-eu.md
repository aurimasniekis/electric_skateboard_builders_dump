Would be after green I currently have 83mm but building a new board and might need more clearance so 97mm might be best. But if you can get green in may come back to you in a week or so.

Hello,

I'm interested, but I am not really sure which colour yet, because I'd have to buy the deck first and I am not sure which one to get :slight_smile:

But I would probably go with black, so are you able to get black wheels?

Thanks in advance
