So I'm building a new board and I want to try and be safe... so I'm looking to buy a helmet.

The FOX Proframe helmet is a full face design which is super open and light. Does anyone use one? Any feedback?

Any other helmets I should think about checking out? I like the idea of protecting my money maker, but non-full frame might be ok.

I looked at a barely used Troy Lee Carbon a few months ago on craigslist. It was so nice, so light, but didn't quite fit. 
Was pretty much like this one.

I was looking for a full-face too and found the [Giro Switchblade](https://www.evo.com/outlet/helmets/giro-switchblade-mips-bike-helmet?image=115750/483508/giro-switchblade-mips-bike-helmet-matte-white-grey.jpg&pt_source=googleads&pt_medium=cpc&pt_campaign=GSC_Bike_Accessories&pt_adgroup=PLA_Bike_Accessories&gclid=Cj0KCQiAgZTRBRDmARIsAJvVWAt4a-rj_0vuC1J7sPtBcJunemi7sgMjnE4Jqnp1I2qyXhtOFnqDZ5gaAppYEALw_wcB). It's normally $250 but they're doing a closeout for the 2017 model, so it's about $125 right now. It's also ASTM F1952 certified and has a removable chinbar.

@mmaner that's sleek! What size are you rocking / how's the fit? Can you wear sunglasses underneath or does the mesh do a good enough job? Is the mesh removable?

@Provoke I was looking at [this one](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01JK2H7RM/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_JCb9BbHYGQ0CQ) until I saw the one posted above. They don't have the white in my size though :frowning:

I have the Bell Super 3r. Its prety comfortable and you can remove the chin bar if you want. I have some Fox racing goggles that fit in perfectly. Comes with a gopro mount on the top.

My beard doesn't quite fit in the helmet all the way though.

Here's a shot of my wife and I knocking out a ride before the weather got crap here. She has a TSG Pass helmet and loves it.
