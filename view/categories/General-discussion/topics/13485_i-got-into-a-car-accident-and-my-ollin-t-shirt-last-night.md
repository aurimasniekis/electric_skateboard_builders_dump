The shirt is badass, the busted board, not so much.

I wasn't hurt, but it was very close, the driver left turned very aggressively into an intersection where I was crossing at a ped-walkway. He wasn't looking and his wheel brushed against my foot as I hopped back. He only realized we were there after he had run over the board and it had crunched loudly.

The shirt though - it almost makes up for it. :laughing:

Filed a claim with the guy's insurance, he was an uber driver/had his own car service. I also don't mind going to court and will probably file a small claim if they screw around. The deck and enclosure are beyond repair. All the electrical appears fine on the surface, but I haven't opened it up yet. We'll see how it all pans out.

Shit man, good thing you bailed in time!

By the looks of the enclosure, the spot welds on the cells may have not survived.

I'll do an autopsy. 

Nothing was rattling around in there and scraped off portion of the enclosure just barely exposed the interior, nothing got through. I could see the physical shock rattling things loose though.

Amen to that. Watch for the whites of their eyes! I had to jump off my board today as someone pulled in to a store driveway right in front of me. Her passenger was blocking her sightline to me so I bailed while watching the passenger freak out because he knows I am in the driver's blind spot. The car stopped well after it should have. Stay safe out there. Pedestrians have right away, but cars are quite hard objects. Poor eboard.

I'm really glad you're ok bro. That is some seriously scary shit. 

But to be completely honest I was  beginning to wonder what it would take to destroy one of my decks. I've seen them take hits from shit that would normally destroy another board. So a car actually has to run over it. Noted. 

I'll bet that pack is a goner though. You might be able to tack it back together if the cells themselves are undamaged but the welds popped.

Thanks. 

The trucks and wheels look fine which I think is remarkable since they were under a tire. 

The battery looks and feels fine too, no breakage in the heatshrink, pack is still solid with no bends, no cosmetic damage and everything works (vesc boots fine, motor runs fine, it charges) and the soc meter looks like it's behaving normally (it acted crazy before when I had a dead cell). 

It's kind of like when a bullet goes through someone and misses all their vital organs, except here the bullet was a car.

Are you going to keep the deck and box for your wall? That's where i put all my old and busted decks. Especially broken ones of ones filled with mistakes. 

You probably shouldn't order any more shirts from Ollin if this is what happens when you do. 

Also, if you want, totally up to you, you can send me your board. this isn't exactly a warranty situation but I'm willing to set you up with a new deck and box to ease your trauma and transfer everything over for you. It might take me a little while to get it done but i won't charge you anything. I have boxes and deck veneer to spare.

I think you need provide a repair bill to prove the amount of damage caused by the incident to get compensated by the insurance company

I just listed this as totaled and sent pictures. The board probably doesn't cost that much more than a small auto claim they may see. 

The insurance company was shady though, hopefully the process isn't convoluted.

if you need for them to contact me about the value of the board and its components, feel free to give them my info. I'll back you up.

I think you need a lawyer!
I would file criminal charges out of general principles the next time that guy hits a pedestrian with out looking it might be a child.

Dang glad you are okay!  

As a side note, how the heck are you still riding your board.  Isn't it like 20 degrees in Chicago?

One of the customizations he asked for was a thermally isolating EM field capable of keeping the rider at a comfy 75 degrees while on the board.

that's actually a good point... how do the laws play into this? Will they treat him like a pedestrian or cyclist? or like an outlaw on an unlicesned illegal prototype vehicle not meant for the roads?

I'm very interested in this case. 

Also i'm packing your blank up tonight and shipping it out.

@smurf I am a lawyer but don't know much about traffic law :disappointed: I don't even know the legality of eskates in IL! I just know that Chicago PD have always been cool about it. 

@photorph layers, lots of layer - two jackets, two pairs of pants, goggles, gloves. 

@longhairedboy regarding that question, it's interesting and kind of complicated. Some states have contributory negligence, meaning any negligence on the part of the plaintiff would make him unable to file a suit (for example, this is the law in North Carolina because of big tobacco lobbyist - smokers can't sue tobacco companies there because they contributed to the negligence in NC). IL is a comparative negligence State which means they'll reduce a plaintiff's recovery amount based on how negligent they were relative to the defendant's negligence. It should be mentioned that just because you're doing something illegal, it doesn't mean it will count as contributory or comparative negligence and reduce the defendant's liability; for example, if I'm carrying illegal fireworks and someone hits me with a car the driver of the car won't have the damages associated with negligence reduced just because I have illegal fireworks.

Similar accidents involving bicycles could serve as precedence when the insurance company or small claims court examines your case. I hope you get your $$ back.

Just wanted to update everyone. I just signed a release for the full amount since they found no negligence on my part.  

The process was kind of a pain in the ass, I think more of a result of the driver and his insurance company being lazy more than anything else.

So you got the full amount you paid back??  Maybe I should just let a car run over my boards next time instead of selling my boards for a loss lol.

Yes - release meaning I'm settling for the amount demanded in exchange for releasing the driver from liability. 

@photorph lol - it was scary as shit man. Also - if you "let" a car run over your board it's doubtful you'd win a claim.
