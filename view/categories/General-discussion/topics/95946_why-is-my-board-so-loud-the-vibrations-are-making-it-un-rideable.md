Can anyone help me figure out whatâ€™s going on? 

Video:
https://youtu.be/ze52HNipfls

My board is ridiculously loud and is causing terrible vibrations and rattling. It feels like itâ€™s coming from the front. It makes me not want to ride it. 

Iâ€™ve replaced the trucks and bearings with brand new ones and it didnâ€™t make a difference. 

All of the internal parts are velcroâ€™d to the board. When I pick up and shake the board with my hands there are no noises or movements. 

Iâ€™m just so confused whatâ€™s causing this. Is it the battery enclosure being too tight? 

What else can I do to test it and see whatâ€™s wrong?

Do you have pictures of the inside of your enclosure before shutting it? Is there foam between anything? Between the enclosure and board? As long as your trucks are assembled normally with standard parts you can probably rule out those

Thereâ€™s neoprene foam between the enclosures and the board. I can open it up and take pictures later today.

what are the enclosures made of? try to fill any empty space inside the enclosures with foam to dampen it. They are basically drums otherwise. That does seem quite loud though. You have the cauguama wheels yes?

Yes. They are eboosted enclosures made of fiber glass

Try using rubber risers. It makes your ride smoother too.

I might try to take the enclosures off and duct tape around everything for a very short ride to see if itâ€™s the enclosures. Would that be smart or stupid and dangerous? I donâ€™t want to puncture the battery obviously

The motors run fine and the vibrations go away on smooth roads so I donâ€™t think itâ€™s the motors.

Both enclosures are causing the vibrations and I donâ€™t know why. I tried putting them on one at a time and test riding. The rear ESC one is less severe but still very noticeable.

I had the same problem with a different enclosure. My solutions was to just tighten it more (the best solution when I built my first board in late 2015)ðŸ¤£
If youâ€™re smart youâ€™ll probably just put some rubber sealing foam or a gasket around the enclosures and see if that helps. 

Are you able to lift the enclosures by the things in them (lift the unity and see if the enclosure stays with it)

The enclosures donâ€™t have anything in them, they just cover the electronics which are velcroâ€™d to the deck. I also already have foam between them.

Hi,

if the enclosures have nothing in them they work like the body of a guitar and amplify the sound .
You could try to use these sticky pads used for audio installations in cars for stopping vibrations on doors etc.

But the enclosures barley fit over the components. Thereâ€™s no room to add sound dampening to them. They didnâ€™t even fit over the battery until I added the foam to give it some more space.

Best tip is you canâ€™t have two hard material touching each other 

Foam strips on the enclosure between it and the board, components firmly attached and foam on top of everything

My two Vescs live in an Al machined housing, separated from the deck with a 3mm thick layer neoprene, and bolted down with typical skate hardware. IF the bolts arenâ€™t tight enuff, it rattles like yours. Only cure was to crank them down ....

Washers on which side? I already have the ESC enclosure lined with foam but thereâ€™s no room in the battery one. And even with the foam in the ESC one it still vibrates and makes the noise.

If you haven't already found a solution;

Over the years building boards and designing my lights any wire, connector, or components that can move _WILL_ move on a longboard due to the extreme vibrations they deal with.  From the enclosure picture you posted it looks like you've got a few wires and connectors that are not secured. I'd say check those; taping things down (or better yet use hot glue or command strips or anything permanent for that matter) 

Anything that can vibrate against the enclosure will make noise as a rule of thumb.

my guess is the vibration is the enclosure vibrating against the screws holding it down. try to reduce any hard surface to hard surface contact area

Make sure to use soft riser pads, Thick foam pads (Double it if it's too flat), From the pics it looks like the Unity is not being held from moving sideways (Double sided tape between the deck and the vesc and a thin layer of foam on top of it before closing the enclosure! Careful not to squeeze the vesc to death), same for the battery, double sided tape to stick it to the deck and foam pad against the enclosure!
Some foam pads can also be rough as some skinny a**, I like this one: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B074829BP6/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1

Itâ€™s velcroâ€™d with heavy duty industrial Velcro. Trust me I couldnâ€™t move it side to side or back and forth if I tried. Same for the battery. Thereâ€™s also neoprene foam on the inside of the enclosure like the one you linked.

So I taped the enclosures over the components without screws and the vibration is exactly the same... so now Iâ€™m more confused.

Velcro is supposed to keep it tight! not absorb the vibration! With velcro, the parts will still rock against the deck and enclosures. Trust me!

It may also just be a bad deck! I have a DIY board using the meepo V1's deck. it is noisy too! not too crazy but I always hear the krrrrrrrrr on rough terrain.

could the enclosure being mostly hollow amplify the sound of the vibration? maybe put foam to dampen the sound. like for car audio using dynamat stops vibration from flimsy panels.

at least you know where the noise is from! Inspect the enclosures and make sure there is no crack! The wires may also be flapping around, especially with those XTs on them

Since you already have healthy foam padding on the enclosure lip, getting softer wheels would help. My board gets louder with harder wheels as well.

Hm perhaps, I've never really used otangs. I do know that there's a huge difference between ABEC 78a and 75a. On paper it seems so minor, but it rides a lot smoother on 75

Try putting thin foam between battery and deck and battery and enclosure, if you haven't already or your battery isn't fully secured from moving.

Didn't read your previous stuff but it seems you are convinced its your enclosures...  can't be sure what solution you'll need in that case but as others have said any piece of plastic/enclosure that is made of hard plastic, and even some stiffer rubbers, will reverb and make noises similar to what you are experiencing.  

I had similar noises with my first build which have lipo packs; it came down to the batteries vibrating against the enclosure and areas of the enclosure without anything between them and the deck. stuff some foam as others have said between the battery and the enclosure, and between the battery and the deck.  Do the same for the focbox and any other components that has the likelihood of touching the deck and/or the enclosure (which should be everything).

When you bolt on the enclosure you should be ever so slightly compressing the components in foam or weather stripping.  Not so much that it is hard to install and stresses the components, but enough so that there is no room for them to move.
