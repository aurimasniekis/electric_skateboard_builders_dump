I returned my Hobbyking 150a ESC to hobby king 3 months ago to their Arkansas warehouse, but I have yet to receive a refund.  Every time I let them know, the customer sales rep just says they've sent a follow up to the warranty department, but nothing ever happens.  This is really frustrating.  Has anyone here had a similar experience with Hobbyking?

I'm in the same boat, but I didn't ship my motor back to them.  I took pictures and submitted the RMA on 3/11/2015. Their website still says "Pending initial evaluation" when I log in.  I got so sick of waiting that I just spent the additional $90 on a new motor assuming they'd get back to me within a reasonable time.

So good luck man...if the money ever comes in it'll be like christmas

ya, that's how they role...

it really sucks if they send you the wrong thing- it takes like 6 months to send it back, and get what you originally ordered.

Yup. They suck... 

I have had three fairly expensive lipo chargers all fail DOA. One after the other... they were all in the same order too.

They didn't refund me any money $300 gone!

I sent video & photos too.

Weird... Mine got refunded in a month. I talked to people over 24/7 chat and they were ok.

You're one of the lucky ones I guess. The customer service reps don't have the authority to authorize anything. They're pretty much useless.

By some miracle, I'm finally getting refunded for the returned items, but it's gonna take up to 3 weeks.  I still think their customer service it awful, and I still have a the tiniest bit of fear that something else will go wrong, and I still wont receive my refund, but only time will tell.

I've bought 4 lipo packs from them with no problems, but if their bad customer service isn't worth the gamble, then yeah look else where.

Guess the good luck is going around, I woke up to this email from HK:

**To our valued customer,**

**We noticed that your RMA (Warranty) claim - Faulty Item/s is pending for resolution. We apologize for the delay. Due to this, we have compensated your account with Bonus Points equivalent to the amount of the product (with claim).** 

**Your utmost patience is appreciated. Thank you for understanding.** 

Surely enough there was $70 USD of credit in my account. I would have rather had the refund but oh well, I turned around and bought a spare motor :smile:

looks like they must be following this thread! it seems really weird that the service got magically better since we start talking about it.

I'm pretty sure when I requested to  return the items, there was an option to choose how I wanted my refund or I might be mistaken.

I called them and threatened to shave our forum handles along with a bunch of horrible phrases concerning their mothers into the fur of all of their pets. It's how business gets done.

Had a bad motor and no problem getting a replacement. Maybe the chat support is the trick. I chatted with an product specialist from them and he took his time to look at a video where i showed the problem. Said i likely could fix it myself but it would void the warranty ... so he recommends replacing it. I filled out the RMA form then ... 2,5 weeks nothing happened, so i decided to ask in the chat how long it would take and that a specialist already have checked my problem ... the support guy looked at the records of my chat and approved the RMA. I could keep and fix my "bad" motor and got a new one.

... so ... not everything seems to be bad with the hk support ;)

Agreed.  If you harass the sh*t out of them on chat things will happen much faster.   I had a ESC that didn't work and they refunded it pretty quickly. I  did follow up with them like 2 or 3 times over chat.

I had 3 reciveres arrive with the servo pins not soldered so I done an rma and pics then send 3 new ones straight away and when they arrived 2 more were the same so they refunded me stringy away. So I think some times is just luck on who deals with your case also in in the uk so not sure if it's a different customer services or not but mine wasn't a to bad of an experience.

Hi Jinra, We wrote to you on the 5th advising you that Sku 9192000363-0 is on backorder.  Please check your spam folder as it might be in there. 

That said, the item is due back into stock any day so if you do nothing it will ship as soon as it gets here.

I spoke your chat twice asking for a refund and they said both times that it's already being processed, but I still haven't gotten a refund. I don't want to wait for the backorder item anymore as it's been over 2 months.

You pay with paypal? Open a dispute and if you cant call paypal and they will straighten it out for you. I think you are protected upto 6 months after purchase.

At this point, it's safe to say this is fraud and you should treat it as such -- reverse the charges and contact law enforcement if you feel like it
