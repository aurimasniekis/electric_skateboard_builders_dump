Title says it all, I cannot afford to buy an mountainboard deck, but I was wondering if a normal longboard deck could be converted to an offroad, trail riding deck? Nothing too hardcore, just something for fun. What differentiates a mountain board from a long board?

Pneumatic wheels which require wide trucks and all of the wide trucks are 35 degrees so you would need some kind of a "adapter"

Bindings also make a huge difference for real offroad, but that would be fairly easy to add to a normal deck. 

The flex of my trampa deck is also very nice, i think it's hard to recreate the feeling with a regular deck without the 35° angle at the tips and the concave shape.

Just run pneumatics, like the ones from @psychotiller, no   need for a MTB deck if you are planning to have fun once in a while.

Look for a deck that is very close to the ground as when you run pneumatics the additional height of a regular board make it look unnatural

As @Acido said you will probably need some risers to adjsut the trucks to the flat deck. Maybe not 30 degrees but at least 15 if you use the standard non-spring trucks from Trampa or MBS. Alternatively you have the 218mm Torqueboard trucks that do not need risers.

I just posted an picture to the "no words"-thread.
I got an rubber belt which i superglued an pattern into. I could have made it look nicer, but it actually works very good on snow. I would think that on rougher terrain, just get thicker rubber.

Would it be possible to take like skateboard deck and use kicktalils as angle for mountain board trucks?

I have torqueboard 218's, I would assume those are wide enough? I can 3D print risers with nylon, that should be strong enough

Bindings are the things that keep your feet on the board right? That shouldn't be too terribly hard to do! I could use a bamboo board to simulate that, and 3d print custom risers. It might look kinda goofy, But it would work pretty well!

Good advice, I didn't think about the lower decks. Maybe one that drops down? I don't know what they are called, but the board itself does what you are saying.

My personal opinion is that 3d printing sucks for applications like these, and I do not trust it, make it out of wood or something if you do not have the tools to make it metal, people have done it, some lasted some didn't but when you go 50kmh I would not like to worry if my raiser will crack or not

I do have the torqueboards trucks, that's convenient! I kinda want the spring trucks in the future... they look so badass...

As long as you use Nylon or Polycarbonate printing should be possible, but no guarantees.

Nylon doesn't crack, I am already using it on my motor pulleys and motor mounts with no problems whatsoever. It's flexible, so it can withstand a ton of force against it. While I would rather use a more solid material, I do believe it is possible!

I would be using nylon, at this point I don't really print with much else :joy:

Very interesting! I wonder how long that would last? How would that compare to something like this? I'm sure yours would work significantly better in snow and sand!

To clarify, the mounts have steel rods through them too. I certainly wouldn't do that with a mountain board setup, it works well for roads

The nylon is a great idea, probably perfect for riser applications.  Nice amount of flex and strength, just keep in mind the hygroscopic nature of it if you plan to ride in the rain.

On the other hand, when you print make sure to put like 5-6 perimeters to keep the screw passthroughs strong :slight_smile:

@Seikeau: Those are just some chinese no-name 550W/70KV hubs with 90mm tires. From Aliexpress. You can find same at Banggood. It is good that material is the same as an rubber belt, and superglue really sticks to it.

@TheFluffiest: I have been rolling about 20km today on snow and rubble. Mostly rubble. There seems to be no significant wear and the superglue holds. And when it eventually wears, it's easy to reapply.
I have no experience from those wheels. I would have got that kind, but they need external motor and i just like hubs.

Just took the maiden ride with nylon motor mounts and pulleys, printed with 7 perimeters and 50% infill. Worked perfectly! I actually found angled risers from an old board, so I am using those

The ride seems like it would be super bumpy... how did that feel? Or did you do the tread in a way that keeps it round? I just took a quick peek, didn't realize those were hub motors. Very creative solution!

Yea, the treads are just close enough that it doesn't make an bumpy ride. I have my front light rattling because it has became loose, so i don't know how much the tires make noise. I gotta fix that, it's annoying.
Next time i'm making the treads V-shape straight away, or better pattern. As you see on the picture, they are made from little stripes.

Let me know how those motor mounts hold up, I am super curious as to the durability.  I know people use 3d printed pullies but idk about mounts

I plan to ride for a bit and get back for sure. I will be posting pictures tomorrow hopefully! I hit some pretty bumpy roads and they handled it with no problems. I made a minor adustment, and it didn't look like there was any wear on the pulley or mounts at all!

Exactly how off-road are we talking? Bumpy roads and potholes are definitely easier to deal with on pnumatic tires and such but you probably don't need a true off-road ride unless you're doing this:

I would very, VERY much like to do that. Do you think that is possible with a modified longboard deck? I more meant like riding around in parks, maybe bike trails and such.

I would say it's possible, with some caveats:
1. Use a flat deck for maximum clearance. Better yet, maybe a boosted deck with the"arc".
2. Mount all of your electronics on top of the deck.
3. Reinforce/waterproof EVERYTHING!

I’ve seen it done before, not necessarily on an electric board, but as a makeshift longboard.

Why mounting on the top of the deck? I would assume to avoid hitting debris on the ground? I will keep all that in mind, thanks!

I also think it's the best idea. You can cut it in shape of Trampa decks. Just need to find a wide enough one. Trucks https://www.mbs.com/parts/12008-mbs-ats-truck-1 and you have nice setup ;)

That's correct. It would probably also help to put everything in some kind of hard case for the same reason.

Sounds good to me. I will make sure I do that, and that I find a board long enough to hold that!
