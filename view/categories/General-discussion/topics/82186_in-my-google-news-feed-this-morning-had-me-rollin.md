Help folks stay chillin by approaching everyone at the park and letting them know that 1) you got fat nugs, 2) they’re dank as fuck, and 3) it’s $40 a gram. After making your rounds, set up a blunt rolling station on the picnic table in the middle of the park

I'm invested in a couple of cannabis companies and fully expect it to be legalized federally in the USA within 12-18 months.  Former speaker of the house John Boehner use to be a staunch advocate against weed is now lobbying to get it legalized.  Going to buy some other stocks in an IPO next week for a grower, distributor that will be able to grow in excess of 500,000 kilos a year.  I don't smoke due to my job constraints  (DOT required random testing).

If you could lobby those companies to push for legalisation in Australia that would be great

It's going to be a gold mine here.  There's major tobacco companies here in the usa that are investing in these cannabis companies now.  Liquor companies and major beer companies investing in them as well.  All of which are fully expecting and realizing the windfall that is about to pop off.  Canada just legalized in October nationally.  Mexico should in the very near future.  They're growing cannabis in the Columbia now legally.  Serious money to be made.  I have a felling the rest of the world will follow suit.  The EU will be soon as well.

It really is an exciting future for the industry. I really hope that big tobacco and big alcohol don't try and commercialise to the point where they push artisanal growers out of the market

I personally feel that won't happen but I do expect that a mass of buy outs and consolidations to take place.  The ability to purchase weed for recreational use will be like buying beer at the gas station.  Keep in mind too that you'll then be able to grow your own as well :)  thus you're your own grower, supplier :slight_smile:

As of last month anyone in the USA can now grow hemp thanks to the farm bill, so at least people can create CBD oils themselves among other hemp related products.  Yeah I wouldn't put it past the conglomerates to F it up.
