Hey Guys,

Ive tried asking @Kug3lis searching the threads, website and instagram but cant find the info im after.

Basically im looking for the dimensions of the Fatboy Nano Drive  (as in how far does the motors extend from the trucks??)

If anyone can measure their version and give approx dimensions id be really grateful.

Thanks
JJ
