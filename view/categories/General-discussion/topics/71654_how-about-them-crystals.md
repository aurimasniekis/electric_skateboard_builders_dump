Super thin. The same old story with hub motor sleeves. When, for the love of God, hub motor technology will allow advances in thane cover four times thicker than actual sleeves provide? ... :point_down:

This is definitely cool to see harfang working with us tho. but hubs are ruthless I have a bunch and have issues ridding them now.. I want a adapter for those crystals badly..been pushing and riding siesmec for years best thane I've ridden..does anyone have adapters for these. I was gonna try the torque board bolt threw wheel adapter but I think it will destroy the core on them..I really want some for my carvon V4SDR badly more then anything..
