Just like the title says my motor is sparking and smoking. 

I have been having the worst luck building my electric skateboard and I am unsure why. 

Parts:
- Torqueboards single motor mechanical kit
- Electric Skateboard Motor 5055 280KV
- 2x Zippy Lipo 5000 mah batteries
- 1 Series connector 
- 120a FVT ESC 
- GT2B Controller 

I have not actually ridden my board because so far whenever I have turn it on and tested upside down on the ground , the motor has been giving me issues. Sometimes it sparks or even begins to smoke, I've stayed away from even thinking to ride it in case of something really bad happens. It usually doesn't start happening unless the motor has either been going for awhile or max throttle. When it does happen I immediately stop and turn it off. I have tried all wire connections from the ESC to the motor. This is also my third ESC because I thought it was an ESC issue. I have tried to programm my ESC to the lowest power settings and the highest ,Checked all voltages, Checked all batteries, Checked  the motor and around it and the way its positioned . 

If anyone could help me I would greatly appreciate it, Thanks.

My e board also smoking at full punch too long.
The smoking I think is max current reaction with the wire
I think you can test you e board as RC car .
If the rc car mod is in good function.
Then you can stand on the board with safe speed

E board without person on it. Use you remote control

Making e board forward in full speed then braking

But the motor smokes and sparks without anyone on it. Why would adding weight to it make it any better?

Also try the chat function on his site.  He's on pretty regularly and easy to reach directly that way.

Where are you located?

Yeah, used to get up there almost every year at least once (Whistler).  It's been a few years now.  Keep meaning to get up there in the spring to paraglide Mt. Cheam... one of these days!

PM me if you want a hand and can swing down.  Happy to help.

IIRC TB's motor's are sensored so make sure your have the motor wires connected in the correct order.  Make sure the sensor wire is connected.  Make sure you have the ESC  motor rotation set to normal.

blue with blue, yellow with yellow, red with black.  However if you've connected the motor incorrectly initially and turned on the esc, the motor could already be irreversibly damaged.   Can you do video of the sparking and smoking?

Thats exactly how I had it with all three of the ESCS. I just tried turning it on and now it wont even turn on. The ESC is running and the GT2B Receiver shows the remotes connected, but no beep from the motor.
