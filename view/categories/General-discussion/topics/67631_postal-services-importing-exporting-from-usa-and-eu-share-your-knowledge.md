Most of us here who either tried to buy or sell something may have encountered or noticed Very high shipping prices, Or felt uncomfortable exporting from or importing into the states. So vendors and regulars have you found an easy cheap solution?

I've found https://www.ecoparcel.eu/ To been nice for EU - EU for those hard to reach places.

[/quote]

I've used these guys like what 2-3 times always late and even worse they BS

If they come a day or 2 late, On the tracking they will Write (Adress error blah blah)
Or you missed the delivery.
