ok guys I did a podcast with Paul, he's a cool guy and has a lot of podcasting experience from another industry. It was fun and I would do it again...

How did I do? Lemme have it!

I'll have to listen to it later when I can pay more attention because I missed the S9 jab this morning.


To me, it seemed like a decent discussion about how there is some good gear available now.

I'm not sure how many DIY people are your age. I'm pretty sure a bunch are begging parents for that $1,500 for the Boosted.

Talk about the joy of DIY, the learning process and this great forum of learners, teachers and creators. I feel that because we work hard to make these things run we see a greater value and treat them with a bit more respect.

Talk about safety. Its not if you fall, it's when you fall. It's not you making a mistake, it's the unpredictable roads and drivers at times.

But onewheel is way more fun in the woods!
I'll gladly pay for the onewheel instead of that thing.

Onewheel does look pretty dope. Recently seen a bunch of kids riding 'em around town, didn't realize they can take hills as well as the do. For street though, I'd think the thinner wheel would have more of a hover board feel to it. I'd certainly like to try both. Looks like fun.
