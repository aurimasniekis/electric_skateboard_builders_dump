I hope this can be a focused discussion on what is the general consensus on Flipsky's FSESC6.6 with an Aluminum case regarding running at 12S and FOC mode.

And by the way, why are you creating this post? Flipsky already has 2 postsâ€¦

The discussions here are almost never focused to a certain extent. Unless a mega thread was created for all posts under a common category.

I'm riding 12s4p vtc6 / Single Fsesc 6.6 / Mayteck 6355 190kv / gearing 15/32 Kegels.
Even at 30A Batt max it's hard to keep the Traction.

I run dual on my trampa.. 80A/-80A Motor and 40/-10 Battery. SK3's (no sensors), Etoxx Belt Drive, FOC with 10S6P 25R's

Only one issue I have found and that is if you use split PPM turning on one ESC turns the second one on. Not had a chance to figure out why it does that. Yes I have disconnected the negative from one of the ESC. I actually disconnected the positive as well, still does it. So I run CAN atm without any problems. 

I have not had any issue with them so far but I have only done about 150 miles, all offroad. They have been rattled to bits and so far no problems. I checked inside the case and all the components are still solid inside. 

Even with the ambient temperature @ 30c I have only seen a max temp of 45c/46c. 

I took a punt and turns out it was a decenct gamble. I'm very happy with the ESC. 

I have heard of one person blowing the DRV chip - https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/new-vesc-from-china-seems-like-not-only-maytech-is-making-vescs-now/5207/357?u=essenn that was switching from FOC to BLDC. I never ran BLDC and don't plan to either.

Hi,

I have been running the ESC in FOC with 240kv motors on 10S without any issues! I think it is a very good deal for the price so I decided to sell them on my website! [You can check it out here](http://electricskateboard.repair/index.php?id_product=45&controller=product), they are on preorder right now and will be available on the 9th of September (maybe even a little earlier depending on shipping).
