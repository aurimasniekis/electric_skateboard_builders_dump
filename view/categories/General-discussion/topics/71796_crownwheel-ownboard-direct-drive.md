Looks pretty promising that Chinese manufacturers are jumping on the dd train, pretty cool that it means the diy community is leading the way in innovation

Iâ€™m not sure but Crownwheel belongs to same group company that has ownboard. I heard from ownboard sales staff.

They have shop in alibaba.com so maybe we can get them with cheaper price by group buying.

Iâ€™m very interested in character of these. Crownwheelâ€™s,  Metasurfâ€™s, torqueboardâ€™s (not released) and Carvonâ€™s (torque/speed).

Looks maybe like steel. How they connect those two parts? There are no screws....

Haha I know what your talking about, it is most likely a press fit or each piece has groves that fit together and are held together by the axle nut. Thatâ€™s what I plan to do so I can disassemble the motor with ease

I tried to do some cad, it didnâ€™t go that well honestly. I have a basic design but nothing to talk about like some of the amazing renders of parts on this forum. Hint hint @Pedrodemio

Can someone show this?

Kind of like how urethane is held onto hub motors with the square sections that the urethane sits into to stop it from being able to spin. I want to do something like that although it might be too difficult to machine and I will just use Loctite to bind the pieces

Seems pretty sweet, if they were compatible with the ownboard esc it would make for a great Budget direct drive.

If @LEVer doesn't get his stuff together fast, he's going to be pushed out of the dd market he created pretty soon. Cheaper Chinese alternatives popping up fast plus hummie and Dexter releasing their own.

I don't think He Cares. His quality product IS for people with deeper pockets and Higher Standards.

Sure but Hummie and Torqueboards are also in that market and in my opinion have much much better costumer service.

To be honest, I was wondering why it took them this long to start developing DD.   Curious to see how this new setup plays out.  

TB should kill it when he eventually releases his product. 

One last thing... Axle.. how thin?

Ya steel.
They are working on reinforcing based on the early result.  
I heard "very soonish"

This holiday season is going to be interesting in terms of DD.  Starting to look like there are going to be quite a few options over a range of price \ performance \ quality \ availability

If these are plug and play for meepo wowgo ownboard that would be incredible... Seriously need to move away from hubs.
