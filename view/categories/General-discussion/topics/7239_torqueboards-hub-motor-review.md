@Hummie had his time üòÇ. Now it's @torqueboards turn. I'm pretty sure that I (basically one of my friends, it was for his build) ordered one of the first, so this topic will be documenting how it works out. Got the single 130kv motor with 83mm wheels. Going to be shooting some benchtest vids tomorrow, and within a couple of weeks hopefully some vids of actual cruising üòé. Anyways, the price on these things is great ($210 for a hub motor, wheels, trucks, and bearings?! Unheard of!) and knowing the great quality of @torqueboards products I'm looking forward to seeing how this goes üòÅ

Looking forward to your review.  I really want a hub motor board to complement my belt drive boards.  

Here's my options:
-Inboard m1 complete
-torqueboard hubs (they will have a complete also apparently)
-carvon 2.5 (but v3 coming soon)
-hummie hubs
-jacob hubs 
-and apparently enertion is working on hubs also

So many choices... If there was someone who could sum up the pros/cons of each.

@Photorph I'd love to be able to review all of them, but no cash to afford testing all of them üòÇ. Maybe @lowGuido would be able to test all of them with his hack board?

Nice... Make sure to locktite the front screws. So far they've been working great for me but I've been using a Dual 75KV 10S setup w/ dual vescs so the performance would be better. Very interested in the 130KV single motor performance. 90mm hub wheels should be done in 1-2 weeks.

I'm a respected butthole, people messaging me from all over the world for my advice...

but I need a new camera so that I can make proper videos. and this e-skate thing is expensive...

very interested in a review of these.  I literally just finished my first e-board last week. (28" 6s 192kv belt driven board) and I'm already researching hubs for my second e-board hub motor build.  This shit is addicting.

I plan a few builds and draw up new deck designs every day... Problem is I have nothing to fund it with. Easiest way to do it: help ur friends build boards (a couple of mine even used my ideas!) or build ur ideas and sell them.

I love the duct tape mount. I don't do any serious commuting with mine and love that DIY look. I agree about the black wheels. I really don't want to go any bigger than 83mm and wish there were even smaller versions on the DIY market. TB, get some black 83mm wheels and you might sway buyers on the fence like me!

Nice.. Yeah, the orange wheels on the hub motors do get much dirtier than the standard wheels. The urethane is not exactly the same as the wheels but it also has to be a harder duro. The 90mm black wheels should be available soon. They should be a better urethane but not sure exactly yet. Can't wait for the 90s. :) I'll look into offering the 83mm black in the future.

Yes the duct tape mount was sketchy at best üòÇ. When the new deck is finished and the electronics are swapped to 6s then we'll make a real enclosure

great review.  I don't know i've ever kept bushings or bearings on any complete (unless let me specify when building).  i always end up tweaking bushings, and bearings are always being cleaned and replaced w/ better...    

Not sure that's a con really.  Look forward to seeing v2 and black thane options!

What was the motor temperature. Any urethane slippage like other motors? Also what was your battery voltage.?

I didn't take exact measurements for temp, but I would say around 140 Fahrenheit. No slippage, It's held in place by a bunch of screws. Battery voltage was about 3.7 per cell when finished. We started at 3.9 though, only went about a mile.

UPDATE:
Unfortunately, this motor has come to a quick end... Got home from a trip in Monterey and the board immediately had problems. We had gone on 2 runs, never took it on rough terrain and made very sure to stay away from anything that could damage the motor or the electronics. With 8-9 total miles on it of normal use, it now makes this sound every time it spins:
https://youtu.be/gp6L7MxJHss
Have contacted @torqueboards about this, currently trying to figure out a way to fix it. I'll let everyone know how this works out.

looks like it can hit a good speed still, think it might just be a screw or other metal object stuck inside.

Actually it doesn't reach same top speed as it did before, it blanks out and won't engage after a certain MPH is hit.

It sounds like something is loose or dragging. I've probably gone about 60-75 miles on my hub motors and they are still kicking. Try and follow the sound.

Did the set screws come loose when you were riding? I'd check the end connectors and wiring first. If there's nothing wrong and your positive. You can possibly try and open it up and check.

sounds like small debris lodged between the stator and rotating can.   Should be a fairly easy fix.

UPDATE: took a little while since I've been working on my own build, but today I finally got the chance to take this thing apart and see what was up. One of the magnets on the side was out of place, hitting the wiring every time the motor rotated. Took it out, went and got some epoxy, fixed it up. <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/4/f/4fb02ecda2f95ed0ea52235668a57fc5eade351b.JPG" width="375" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/c/5/c547399a8a55775ccdb8e7097c3b89e3ecc0178d.JPG" width="375" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/1/3/132540f93ad1bd3ee2acb996268a5fad9f564870.JPG" width="375" height="500">

Glad that it's working, much smoother now as well. My friend who was not too happy before is now very much looking forward to riding again. I'm sure that this problem was not very common, it seems that where the magnet was just needed a little more epoxy, not a big deal at all.

Any sense of how it works at very low speeds - say 1-2 mph?  (I'm trying to make an electric walker for a 96-year-old guy - think of it as a very wide electric board, with handrails. Needless to say, he's not going to be tooling down the street at 20mph :-).  I'm wondering about how a pair of these motors stand up at slow speeds - adequate torque, heating, power consumption.  Anything you can share from your experience?  Thanks!

At 3s the motor gets hot very quickly, stutters a little bit at start and has decent torque. At 6s it takes a little while to heat up, stutters less at start and has decent torque. For both voltages the motor is exceptionally speedy though - honestly the best way to go slow for your application is to use a 15mm belt system with 3s, 145kv motors, and a 12:42 gear ratio. Great torque, and top speed is 4 mph

@Gabriel7845 I don't really remember the name exactly, but it was a standard two-part mix epoxy. Not very hard to find at local hardware stores. Just make sure to look at the heat rating, I'm pretty sure the one I used is good up to 250F
