Don't know about other apps, but I'm sure they'll be formatted to the screen.

Yes, I have a VESC 4.12 and I don’t think anything for IOS is out for that yet

I’m using the Metr module and app on iphone 7 with ios 11 and Apple Watch 3
The disply is fully customizable on iphone but only 2 readings display on Apple Watch. 
@JLabs  is offering a module and app for iOS that displays more data on the watch.

Those where random generated numbers, not real.

Old topic but still valid. Is there any good vesc app for the iPhone? I’m using the eSkate vesc app now and it’s good but I see that the ackmaniac tool for android looks even better. I tried using a Samsung s5 but quickly discovered that it doesn’t support the BLE module properly and I learned why I left android so I’m hoping to find something just as good for IOS :)

For me Metr is the best one, but you have to buy the module from @rpasichnyk
