Also their social media pages leads to the home page of Twitter facebook and YouTube. It's someone trying to make a quick buck. I'd say it's a scam

This entire thing is constructed from alarm bells.  I wouldn't be surprised if Ann Pearson is a fake or stolen identity.  There's an 80+ year old woman named "Ann A Pearson" that lives in the area near Bryan, TX.  You could just call the number and see what happens LoL

God , what a Steal! Can't wait to get my 6 sets.  Ann is a great person for bringing such a good deal to us.

I sent cash in an envelope,  because Ann has no other way to process payment.

Weird, huh?

Oh well, can't wait to get my wheels!
