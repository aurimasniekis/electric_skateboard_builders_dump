Looks really compact! (at least the longboard kit)..

The mtb's one could be a bit more stealthy looking.. looks like an awfully big bumper..

That longboard kit look very bulky. I thought it's dual drive, but it's not. Or then you can fit dual too, but they use single only as example.
Mtb look much better.

Perpahs if they changed the color from orange to something else (mtb one).. it would look better.. but I still dont like the fans sticking out and that orange box in the middle.. if they get rid of it.. then it would look quite good..

Should have kept it black or silver..

I have one of those MTB Kits. Quality is bang on, super lush craftsmanship down to the detail. Very light and sturdy. Very Trampa quality wise. They are really made with passion. I personally don't like the plastic to be so colorful. Since the parts are printed, any color can be used I guess.

Ok, I promise this is the last pic.. but they have totally different style building these boards.. im sure Ive not seen anyone use leather bag or anything similar on their boards.. tupperware is more popular  :smiley:

Oh yeah, they buy one board after another. Half of Korea rides Trampa. The Style is very manga.

_Will update the thread not to create a new one_

Not sure about others but I find their builds quite fascinating. A lot of thought / design / machining in some of them ;) 

Pure Build Porn in some of them

Nice, there's some really cool looking MTB builds on here! Anyone speak Korean, know if there's a translate icon? Looks like a lot of the threads require login to view.

Yeh, I saw this too, otherwise the only accesible pictures are the ones at the bottom.

@Martin Can you help us see more pictures / builds there?

I registered but saw that some posts can be only seen by 'power users'. Otherwise, still nice to see at last a few pictures of the builds + a lot of riders together at once at group rides

You need to raise your grades.
