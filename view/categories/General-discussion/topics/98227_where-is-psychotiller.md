I noticed he hasn't posted in almost a month and I haven't heard from him about an order in about the same. I hope he's OK.

Yeah, and now we dont deal with one dictator but instead two. I signed in like a month ago... and no response so far. So I asume is only a site for just a few priviliged people and not the rest of us. Which is logical, since that site was created to counter this one. The reason for the whole move was to 'steal' the most relevant, unhappy and knowleageable peeps from the community and to some extent Esk8news was successful in achieving that goal.  Everybody knows that. So now that attracted a good chunk of the savy peeps this the current state of affairs. Guess we are going to continue in the blue regarding 'news' from the other side.

Are you saying only privileged people are allowed over there?
 
I'm trying to decipher your sentence, and if that's the case i'm pretty sure everyone is welcome over there.

What do you even mean by no response? We are pretty active over there and welcoming new members everyday.

If you are saying that your email was not registered then please try again. Initially they had issues with the server because of the massive influx.

Exactly that my friend. I'm not crazy. Sign in is a sign in. Send it and then nothing........ never got a response by mail, a link, or nothing. So I tought: "hummmm... I'm in the middle of a war here, perhaps is better to leave things like that and dont get involve in a fight that is not mine". This was when everybody was crazy about flocking to ... "We are going there, c'monn sign in". Went there did my thing and then...nothing.

So I assumed that hapened for a reason and now is up to their webmaster to accept you or not. Just forgot about the whole thing and kept living my daily ESBuilders live. But people kept mentioning things are happening there, sales, "I dont come here any more, I'm all there now" ...blah, blah, blah. :roll_eyes:

It's just an error with their forums for some reason. I had the same issue when i signed up, for some reason the  forum hates Yahoo emails(not sure if that's what you are using). 

After trying my Google email it came through almost instantly.

Nah, just that your mail provider rejected the mail silently as they thought it was junk.  When the new forum really started going, it looked to their servers as a brand new spammer ... their systems couldn't tell the difference.  Now they know it's legit.  A bunch of emails bounced there for a moment.

Yea even my account didn't register at first. I waited a day and tried again and it worked.

It was never meant to steal anyone from this site, those people left because they didn't appreciate how a certain person spoke to them and their friends. They weren't stolen, they were driven out.

So if ya wanna join, just do it, try it again. The servers/hosting has been upgraded since the whole community pitched in and help fund it all.

What kind of insecure thinking is this I'm reading?  There is nothing elitist going on at news in fact just the opposite.  The same people you got along with here are now there.  Its not personal to you at all.  It was very personal to those who got banned from this site for expressing negativity towards the owner regarding his business practices and thats the reason for the exodus.  Theres no war.  No animosity just a group of people that wanted to actually be a part of a community and not a sales platform.  For goodness sake try again and you will be made very welcome.  I only come back in here to interact with the likes of you dude.  The ones that are not over there so relax theres no conspiracy going on.  When you turn up I will personally give you a big sloppy kiss.  :kissing_heart:

I know psychotiller is busy but I'm also waiting on an enclosure and as a first timer at this DIY thing I went with him because I saw nothing but great things to be said about him by everyone.  But I'm not gonna lie, I'm not impressed rn.  He's not responding to emails and I'm not the only one apparently :no_mouth:

pretty sure that its all automated
it could be that the email is being sent to spam or not sent at all because of some error, Im sure if you send any moderator on there an email they will activate your account

psycho looks at his phone like twice a day, and if he doesn't see your message queued up during these rare events, you likely won't get a response.  so ping him again.

Dave's an old man, he prefers phone calls :rofl:

I would text him just to make sure he's at his place vs working at Abec11's shop. I have no idea where he hides his phone

Sorry everyone. Dave's been showing up in my dreams every night and super busy doing all kinds of weird and random stuff my imagination comes up with. During the day when he's off the clock, I'm sure he's pretty sore and got his hands full dealing with managing the psychological implications of his depraved shenanigans from the night before. Then on top of that, he's got to spend like an hour or two everyday making ridiculous electronic toys for nerdy man children. It's a rough life, but that's how he likes it. :man_shrugging:

I didn't read in detail all the answers of this post so sorry if I repeat something already said :

* I've created my account on esk8 forum just now with my yahoo email, and got no email confirmation after some 5 minutes in my yahoo mailbox;
* So I decided to create a new account with my gmail email, and got the confirmation email quiet instantly;
* ... but finally the confirmation email arrived in my yahoo mailbox !

Conclusion : yahoo mail servers network is much slower than google's one... and now I've got two accounts on the esk8 forum :(.

So my advise : wait the confirmation email up to half an hour before creating another account like me  !

... and thank's too for this post, as it confirms what I supposed about psychotiller's "silence" !

Let's let him breath !
