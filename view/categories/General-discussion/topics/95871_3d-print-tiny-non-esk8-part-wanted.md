Is there someone in here that would be willing to print a part for me?  It’s not skate related.  Happy to compensate accordingly.

It’s a pair of switch covers.  The letters on top I don’t care about.  I can measure dimensions.

US, Indiana.

I don’t know my 3D plastics.  Looking for something that will withstand a “push momentary on toggle” type of switch.  The covers each fit over a pair of side by side metal toggle switches.

I can finesse the final fit and finish (including drilling the hole for the toggle lever), if need be.

I'm in the US too, I can take a shot at it. There's a looot of print plastics out there, I usually just stick with ABS for durability. Shoot me some dimensions.

Not to swipe this away from @Dirt_Bag, I don't mind a bit of light cad work for a simple to make part. Just PM me measurements!

That looks like it is for a boat. If so I would be printing in ABS or TPU. Probably ABS for looks. 

PLA will degrade over time and become quite brittle. Looks like an easy and quick print. Probably will take longer to design the model....
