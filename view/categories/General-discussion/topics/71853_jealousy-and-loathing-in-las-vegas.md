Alright people.

My Instagram feed has been inundated with awesome pictures and videos of all those assholes having the time of their lives in Las Vegas at the Renegade Rendezvous.

I am happy for them.... I guess. But I also resent the fact that I am not there. @mmaner and I were planning on driving out there from Alabama so we can take all our boards, but alas.  Life got in the way (life is bullshit).

I am literally missing the who's who in the Es8 world. My blood is boiling. 

I can't stopping looking at all the posts from you dick head attendees.

Soooo, I don't know why I started this thread. Maybe merely to have a private pity party.  But I feel like I can't be alone in mine loneliness.

Please use this thread to post your thoughts/grievances on not being at that epic event along with pictures of what you are doing instead.

Attendees, first of all, I hate you. Secondly, please post up as many photos as you can so we bottom-dwellers can live vicariously!

[Picture here of me sad, but even the forum is fucking me over]

Because

 2: Still having issues with my board and I'd hate to drive all that way to find out something went wrong halfway through the event
 3: I hate driving long distances alone

If I tried to explain to the wife that i wanted to go to Vegas for an Esk8 event she'd think I was seriously insulting her intelligence.  No babe really its for an esk8 convention. Not the hookers and the gambling and all night drinking  Honest!  Think it would be more worrying if she did believe me lol

It rides surprisingly good, I need to wedge it a bit more. The deck is at 20 degrees, the trucks 50 degrees, with 5 degree wedges, makes it 35 degrees but I need about 5 more to make it eally turny. I'm not happy with the grip, I'm gonna regrionit with some Hazzard grip I picked up.

The broadway bomb is the third weekend in October every year which this year just so happens to be the same as the Vegas esk8 event so I don’t think they would do that. But I would love a NYC esk8 event as that is just a hour train ride for me.

My cousins wedding had me out of this months ago. It sucked. Vegas next year..

"Weygas" lol. Reminds me of senior year in high school: all the cool kids were going to Cancun for spring break. Those of us who couldn't swing an international vacation in high school had FOMO hard. So this kid named Connor threw a party at his parents mansion instead. Dubbed "Con-cun." He hired a stripper. It was epic!

Not Vegas that is for sure. :sob:
I don’t even want to look at the pictures of the event and prefer to imagine that it was as sad as a bunch of pensioners playing slot machines on Fremont street. 


Obviously that’s the jealousy speaking, it has a mind of its own. I am sure they had a blast.

Semi on topic. I missed the tunnel run and strip ride because I was stuck soldering shit together in my... suite bathroom at the Venetian (oasis sold out). 

Sorry, doesn’t sound as bad as I thought it was at the time... The struggle was real.

You know what the worst part of all of this is? I just got back from Vegas this morning, cause I played in a baseball tournament there. I couldn’t go to the esk8 event though cause when your 15, your parents most likely won’t say yes to “ hey mom, dad, can I go hang out with my middle age friends that I met online?”
