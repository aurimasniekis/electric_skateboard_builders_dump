Hey guys

I designed a caliber mount wich should be cheaper than the ones available now but very strong and easy to use.

The mounts will be finished in approxematly 10 workdays. From than on the retail price will be ‚Ç¨39.

If you want to pre-order: https://electricboardsolutions.com/collections/pulleys-belts-mounts/products/caliber-mount.

The reason I do this is to finance a part of the production cost :slight_smile: (The ‚Ç¨14 will probably not cover the cost for one piece :face_with_raised_eyebrow: )

The mount will be made of construction metal S235, lasered out of 4 & 15 mm sheets and finished with a white galvanization and comes in 2 parts attached togheter with M5 bolts.

Have you made one of these and tested it out? I highly suggest you do so, as there are some visible problems with the mount.

I feel that you need to make one or two out of metal and test them before you do a pre order. 

These mounts have square edges which can‚Äôt but cut on a CNC. Your also holding this on with a set screw on the rounded portion of the truck...

Oh I didn't write it will be lasered out of metalsheets 4 and 15mm. And yes on the round side because it is easy reachable, but I will change it to the flat side. Thanks for the feedback!

Put this together, with a metal prototype, bolt a motor on, and turn it on, with belts and pulleys and wheels, then bash the skateboard wheels-first into a concrete wall as hard as you can for 15 minutes.

If anything moves, it needs to be redesigned.

Because, in fact, that is exactly what happens while riding a skateboard.

Hello Frederic,

I see 1 big problem with your design:
- You cant change the belt tension, you really should take attention on that.
- About the set screw, some people don't understand physics I guess, because of the form of the caliber truck, your design is even better than putting the screw on the opposite side, because now when you pot tension on the screw, you will have a 3 point fixing (the bottom of the screw, and the two opposite corners). It is a good design, just make sure to use a strong and big enough screw :slight_smile:
- sorry 1 more thing, the more they say it's impossible, the more you can prove the're not right :slight_smile:

Hey @Steve-81

Thanks for the feedback! I put sleds on it, so the motor can slide, won't that be enough?

It's now a 6M screw, but maybe I will change it to 8M ;)

Did you saw the mounts by @marcmt88 ?
They have a lot better design!

my thoughts on your design:

* belt tension by shifting motor or idler pully is needed.
* round the edges of the caliber profile, to fit it better
![Unbenannt|438x437](upload://WUYZ6oaGDVEC5qubYEfPcqb8xm.JPG)
* felxible angle of the mount is really nice!
* no need for that huge edges of the caliber clamp
![Unbenannt|467x496](upload://lC9erBZgM20tWn2suXS5pfOsaGg.JPG)
* no need for that overlap:
![Unbenannt|690x366](upload://7yogCn8zRlg63zEYNh2fP44ERqa.JPG)

But I love the idea of having a reliable and fair priced alternative within the EU!!

This is designed to fit with even 15/16mm wide pulley? 
and...
Countersunk screw holes would make it easier to fit wider pulleys/belts..

And you mean this with screw holes? It would defenityly be better but I have to be milled what would make the pice more expensive :confused:

add an adjustable idler pulley (vertically adjustable). That way the motor bolt holes can stay fixed and you can produce it by just laser cutting it. That way you can set the perfect belt tension and improve the efficiency of the drivetrain.

(see ollin revolver mount)

Countersinking should be esily done with just a drill.... (on a normal hole though)

Hmm yes, but I don't really like the idea of an idler pulley, because normally it's put on the side of the belt with no load, and with esk8 the load changes from the one side to the other while breaking/accelerating. I could be wrong though. Who has experience with using idler pulleys?

well... I suggest you visit the several topics about idler pulleys on this thread...

I went form skipping teeth while braking (because I didn't want to over tighten my 9mm-5M belt) to braking flawlessly and coasting about x2 more.

You should try them then, it has its ups and downs i dont want to use them personally but i understand people do, it removes most of the wear put on the belt from slipping and in general increases the area of contact on the belt.

Yeah my first plan was to go for aluminum, because you can anodise it in such a cool colors :heart_eyes: But the dude of the metal company suggested steel because it's stronger and probably cheaper, I will ask him what the price difference would be. If it's nog to big I will go for aluminum :)

Short answer is no. However, in practice you're attatching a rotating magnetic field onto a ferromagnetic material. Its bound to be some disturbance inbetween the two. All depends on how close they are and the corresponding direction of each field. My very first built i machined a similiar mount out of steel. Just seeing it stick to the barrel of the motor when put close made me Think tho

Updated mount, still need to add the idler pulley. If you want to pre-order, do it [here](https://electricboardsolutions.com/collections/pulleys-belts-mounts/products/caliber-mount).

Btw wich idler pulleys do you guys use? The smallest I found is [this](https://www.aliexpress.com/store/product/POWGE-15-Teeth-5M-Idler-Pulley-Tensioner-Wheel-Bore-3-4-5-6-7-8-9mm/702327_32817244693.html) one. Wich is till quite big :/

Thanks for all the previous feedback :)

Did some last updates:

- No idler pulley but sleds for the bolts
- Motorplate bigger to protect √ò63mm motors
- Holes for maytech motors with √ò30 & √ò44 bolt paterns
- Adjustable angle

Still taking pre-orders [here](https://electricboardsolutions.com/products/caliber-mount).

I would reduce the the outer diameter of the mount at the clamp, since you don't need protection there.

Since you don't have separate holes for idler pulleys in this design, placing the outer holes for the motor so that they'd be running parallel with the mount (x instead of +) would allow for using one or two of those bolts to add an idler onto (that was a messy explanation, but just check deckoz's mount and you'll see what I mean).

Yes there is, cause that would only adjust belt tension, while an idler pulley allows for more teeth in mesh and at the same time you can then release on belt tension.. Less belt skipping while accelerating or braking and less strain on motor bearings.

That must have been really bad back in the days :slight_smile:
I had a go on Pro/E Wildfire at Uni and the damn program always crashed  randomly, particularly during exams!

The tech we had was impressive for public schools, but that's why taxes in NY state are so high. It's just strange how they lag behind in terms of the value of their public universities. GA has NY beat in terms of the public college setup.

Did you add the idler? What's your final design? 
I want to test these for you -and risk streeting my face- if you fix me a good price.. Support your local skateshop innit!

Got some of these mounts fitted on now, clamp took nice snug fit on hanger. Waiting for it to dry a bit before can get out for a test rip! Seem like will be pretty decent mounts![1524939631567640649119|666x500](upload://7DGRM6oyI6v6UpJDVqR9rK0dOLX.jpg)

Hey, looks cool :slight_smile:

Are the mounts parallel? Because the round part is also lasered and that's not very accurate. Next batch I will let the round parts get CNC milled for better precision :slight_smile:
