Hi! Ive been wondering - do you get to see a lot of riders on streets where you live?

Im from relatively non dense population country, so esk8 is rare but I have found a few people over internet and actually one on street by pure luck (he had built it from a lot of enertion parts, the deck was only made by a guy he knows, for the purpose of fitting space cell which should not bend under flexy deck)..

--

So yeh, if you got comments to leave about this, would be cool to hear them.. I suspect in bigger US cities it might be a common sight now to see at least a few esk8'ters every day.. but how is it with smaller places?

On the little Island I live on there is less than 1 person per square/km...quite a few tree huggers with electric cars, but no esk8's... If I go to town on the mainland I know a few.

Denmark - nearly unknown, at least in my area. Know one guy in my town that was Koowheel and that's pretty much it. Probably mostly because we have a lot of rain and we dont have many boards that can properly handle it. And because of bikes, danes love bikes.

This is a very good question @Okami! I live in vienna/austria (1800000 people) and i've never seen any esk8 in my town. I think this is the reason why 98% of the people stare at me like i'm an alien :joy: 
But there are many kids with 5 km/h balance scoooters here and i enjoy their faces when i'm passing by...

Yep a lot of balance scooters here too.. somehow people find money for them, even if they dont go faster than 15kmh or so and does not seem to be made for uneven / bad roads :)

Hah yeh thats how.it is.usually. 

I assume we could as well start a new thread about.how we found about esk8'in.general..

For.me it started when i saw a video couple of years back.where some people.were riding mountainboards with fat tires and dc motors through sand n.such terrain. (This is where idea was born that one day i would want a similar thing)

After some more time i wanted to.build something electric, ebike was first.choice but it looked like there is still mechanical.complexity and it still might end up.costing a lot and then i found about esk8 and this forum.and thats.how everything started.

Not sure anymore did.i.watch.a video.and.there was a link.to.forum or what but i ended up.here :)

Nice!

You make me laugh because i started when i read the article "How to build an electric longboard for 300$" :joy::joy:
Well, in the end it was more than 1000,- and i've learned it's better to wait, doing more research and join this community!

In my area (Charleston, SC) - I haven't seen a single one.  However I wouldn't doubt that some college kids downtown have some.  It is a heavy driving area with little biking/alternative transport so I assume that is why it isn't popular.

I think I will be the first one, once I get my board together...

Provo, Utah: The univeristy I attend (finishing my Electrical/Computer engineering degree) doesn't allow any skaeboarding (much less the fast electric variety), so I don't see any on campus, but I know of a few.
I built my board together with a friend of mine (fellow electrical engineer), and I know of one other in the engineering college who built one about a year before we did ours (last summer). And I think I've seen 1 boosted around town (off campus). That's about it. There is a skate shop that sells boosted boards, so I imagine there's probably one or two more, but I haven't seen them.

Southend, Essex, UK.
I've not seen ANYONE else e-boarding at all. Electric scooters, yes, lots of kids with them, but boards, no.

A lot of people stop me and say "oh is that a boosted board?"!
No you fool, it is not! :confused: 

So they're aware of electric skateboards, but no-one else as yet...

in madrid-spain i meet a few guys maybe 8 (two of them are from this forum) but this shit is starting to grow because now boosted boards are shipping to spain.

i really liked to meet these people because i was able to try some eboards without spending billions: magneto, carbon gt, bamboo gt, onewheel, diy.. and i hope in a few weeks try the gtx and boosted board :D

i've a little whatsapp group with 12 guys from madrid but we didn't meet all at once yet.

I can't speak in terms of actual statistics but from what I've personally seen over the past few years in NYC as well as throughout the parks and recreational areas within the NY tri-state area, the esk8 community is slowly but surely growing. 

What was once considered a "luxury toy" for only those with deep pockets, has now become a much more mainstream and affordable sport. This is undoubtedly due to in part of "brand x" boards that essentially cost as much as your typical gaming console. It is allowing those who want to get into the sport an opportunitiy to do so without breaking the bank. Naturally, this is also playing a huge part in the amount of esk8 riders we are seeing out and about. 

One of the biggest drawbacks or I should say thorns to the sports for this perticular area are the roads. Unless you're on a bicycle path or some kind of designated commuter / skater pathway, the roads around here suck! Uneven surfaces, cracks, pot holes, poor repairs, metal grates / covers, and general debris make it a real life obstacle course. Then you have the pedestrians who are in la la land and drivers who all seem to have gotten their drivers license yesterday. It's pretty crazy to say the least. 

If the board you're on is not properly setup / built to tackle these issues or if you do not have the expertise and experience to overcome them, you are not going to enjoy "the ride." It's for this reason I also believe we are seeing a big second hand market on esk8 equipment in the area.

Nevertheless, on a daily basis, it's not uncommon to see a handful or more esk8 riders in and around the NYC area, and thanks to Kaly, I'll be adding myself to that list in a few short weeks!

What I gather from lurking in some local facebook groups is that there are at least 10+ boosted owners in Portland Oregon.  One local diy builder contacted me on this forum so I know we have at least 2 diy builders in town.

That's what I thought but didn't say.  The local riders group used to be advertised as a  boosted sponsored meet up but now it looks like its been opened up. But judging from the face book group its still mainly boosted boards. 

The group rides look short, like 20 blocks and flat, and the riders look like a bunch if noobs. Not really a fast riding group.

 I know some relatively easy local downhill rides that would likely make them piss themselves.  I also know of some longer rides along the river but then there's that range thing boosted had going for it :-P 

I'll likely pass on the group rides with them, and likely go shred with other diy builders in town. Then at least if we can't go fast we can at least do some miles, and see some shit.

What happens when a Boosted shows up... it becomes a discussion in range especially if they are in the minority. 

It depends on the group..I see what the guys in NYC do...they hook up via a power strip and use the secret charge spots around the city that can be accessed by the public. It's a social thing...and nyc is very social so hanging around chit chatting while charging is a thing....so distance becomes less of a worry.

It's definitely a social scene in NYC. But the range with boosted becomes a problem for the diy guys that want to ride more than 4 miles at a time.

Nah side topics are all okay, it gives some insight anyways, we had a side topic at the beginning too about.how we started to be interested in esk8.

I assume not.everyone can afford or needs a car in big city like nyc (+ traffic.jams), so taxi culture and eboards nourish :smiley: especially after seeing some videos how a few esk8ters leave all the cars standing at intersection

Yeh this is going to be in future - esk8 communities, same as there are now motorcyclist unions, car nut meetings and so on :slight_smile:

I assume boosted has made their "squad" already by creating such short rides around the.city :smiley:

I sort of feel.bad.for.them that the manufacturer offers decent range only now (and still.not as standard.i believe) , i assume they didnt care about it then and maybe wanted.to save on.some.components? 

Though these lithium cells they use for their boards (A123) if i remember correctly still cost decent money so it.might as well.have been some other decision which led.to.such low range final result

Since I hijacked the thread before I'll add from my Vegas perspective and @nmagz3 @KlethBane @ekitesurfer @Pablo_702 @thisrealhuman can chime in since they are all in Vegas basically....

No we don't see any esK8 here.. there are some ....but it is a rare sight... def recreational and not used for commuting because of the distances for jobs and the weather extremes here.. I know of a few others that have esk8 that are not on the forum...(4 people, two boosted, one stary and a big daddy eboard) they stick to their local neighborhoods...so I'm guessing there others but they aren't out skateing downtown Las Vegas or other places I go .... they just stay home and ride around the house...I'm assuming

Yeh i agree with you on this point, i think esk8 can be really good "neighbourhood surfing" devices so a lot of people just might choose to stay and ride there than to hassle with traffic, pedestrians, shitty roads and so on :smiley:

The place where i live, there is abour 1mile radius or so with super shitty roads, so esk8 for me can start or "get interesting" if i get some distance away from home, otherwise it is nasty curbs, freaking rain rails on pavement (u type cutout in middle.of sidewalk), old style brick roads.. unimaginable for.regular longboard wheels.. so yeh, thats why i stick to.mountainboard.to.at least ride.on.half more surfaces than regular wheels.could.handle (not.to.mention vibrations)

Just.my sidepoint about local ride conditions.i have to face.to.ride :D

Yeah, Vegas is a driving city.  Kinda like one big suburb.  However, because it's a newer town relative to the rest of the metro cities you find a lot of awesome pavement. and some roads in newer developments can be awesome for speed demons that want to test their top speeds.

I know there are people who commute regularly because I've seen them from the bus and there is a relatively new eskate group here that has done a few grouprides. mostly boosted it looks like. the downhill scene is pretty great though as is the park and street scene so its only a matter of time before people get their hands on eboards and they start becoming more common.

Theres NONE, as in NONE that rides them here.

Almost no places to ride, but yet i still ride mine everyday.

If anyones spots my comment and lives in Denmark Holstebro, please hit me up.

Wow, really surprised that this isn't more popular worldwide. Well here in Perth, Western Australia I have seen at least 6-9 unique people along the Scarborough beach area.

Had a woman driver in a car beep her horn as well, even though I was no where near her. Bloody idiot, but needless to say, not many riders around me in the midlands. I'm probably only 1 of few if there is. Quite upsetting really, as I have no way of doing group rides :(

I go to uni in Colorado, USA, and I've seen maybe 5 esk8s around my campus of 30k people. It's certainly not because people are board shy- Probably half the people I know ride longboards. 

If I had to guess, I'd say no one rides esk8's because it's so flat around campus, no one minds pushing. I'd be interested to see if other American universities notice any kind of trends. Maybe Coloradoans just prefer snow sports?

I am not surprised people here in the US seeing other Esk8'ers in Florida, NYC, California, etc... bi-coastal and some big city culture will no doubt bring them out.

I am in Atlanta and I know most of the esk8 people here -- they ride on the belt line so at least I know where to go to find them.  I think what we do is nerdy and risky (to some extent) and those two don't often go together. The esk8 people I know have Evolve, Uni-Wheel, or Boosted. I can't get my buddies involved in DIY... the curiosity to learn/re-learn a little electronics, deal with VESC software, etc it's all too intimidating for them. It was intimidating for me too... I came from software and related so I do some programming and nerding but I totally forgot my college physics lessons... totally had to remember and read and do all that.   These are often not prized qualities here in our culture always.  Anyways too political so i digress... we have to do more to get people interested when they ask. Now I get asked ALL the time 'how much does that cost', 'can I buy that from you', and I would rather teach it.... but meh whatever I am noob myself and probably not a great teacher.

I live in Sacramento, the capitol of California and located in Northern California, some people don't really know this but California is really like two different places, divided into the north and south, it's not that we are different, it's just we are so far away we develop two different cultures and it's rad.

The bay area and San Fransico is like a bubble and an entirely different world inside, they have a ton of electric skaters, also a long history and heritage of skateboarding in general considering many of the finer skaters in history came from here and southern California. We sort of are the birthplace for modern skateboarding as we know it and it's not a surprise we have a lot of electric skaters too considering the tech industry here and the number of "makers" we have.

I do see people I do not know riding electrics in town while commuting, there's so many people here just trying to herd them into a FB group or find the ones who eskate is very difficult. We have a local Sacramento group on FB with about 50 people in it, the nearby town of Davis (a college town) has another small group as well and we get together sometimes. the bay area has a giant fb group and events all the time and tons of people riding.

Based on how rad this activity is and how little I see people picking it up, coupled with the existing skateboard hatred toward electrics (which we have a lot of) it actually is sort of slow to take off here. We have an image problem and California should be an indication of where the market needs to go. There's untold numbers of skateboarders here and yet a very small acceptance of electric power ones, that could change with some marketing and culture shift and it's possibly poised for a giant hype market explosion. 

But like anything in California if it's not "cool" it typically isn't accepted, and that's what's going on here. I roll around and get tons of compliments from laymen on the street, but nothing but hatred from existing skaters and bikers on the trails...I aim to change that by using everything I can from the existing skate industry that is cool and combining it with brushless power systems. If you roll up to the skaters with something that looks exactly like what they ride or want, only better, they might accept you and eskating more. If they change their opinions and all go out and buy one, then we are screwed because they already know how to skate better than any of the consumers buying commuter boards at Frys. It's like a entire market just sitting there untouched and shelter itself through fear of change and the hatred is just it's expression.

While I would say it's more popular here than other places and we constantly see people riding them, it has a long way to go and tons of room for growth. We also have a lot more people here in general so you cannot really compare it fairly to other places other than NYC, LA and FL. Just in my city alone, we have at least 5 major skateparks with giant bowls and pools and even a full pipe, that's not even counting the 20 other smaller neighborhood skateparks all over the place. When I say we have a lot of skaters I mean tons, skateboarding is a mainstream accepted sport here, I believe there's about 5 skate shops in town carrying longboard and shortboards, and none of which bother to carry electrics due to the culture problems...if we can get that to change, and get skaters to think electric skateboards are cool, the market is poised here to literally explode overnight...but these are smart and savvy consumers, they can already skateboard and know what goes into a good skateboard and they look at the eskate market and laugh, with very good reason...make them a skateboard and market it to them directly instead of dumb commuters who have never ridden a skateboard before and you open the doors to the perfect demographic that could set this all on fire and make a few of you very rich....electrics in existing skateshops with some basic standards for parts and plug-n-play electric components, will go a long way to show that we want their acceptance..

I have also noted a lot of hatred going back the other way as well, people complaining on FB and other places about being hated on by skaters and it's perpetuating a cycle, everyone need to rise above it, it's silly and only hurting the growth of the market..not to mention we are all skaters, electric or not, we have more in common than we think and the electric market can learn how to be cool from them, and maybe they will try these things out and be open minded instead of rejecting the idea..

electric and traditional skating are two VERY different animals.
A normal skateboard is not really suitable as a serious mode of transport. Electric is exactly that.
Properly riding a normal skateboard with style requires a lot of practice and skill. Electric riders usually don't give a crap about riding style and you can learn to ride in about a day. You don't even need to be athletic at all. 

I can kind of understand where the animosity comes from. Some lazy ass esk8ters acting like spending 2000$ on a toy also makes them a cool skater is kind of like an American/Belgian beer sneaking on to the shelf next to the proper traditional German beers and thinking it fits in.

ps: I am a really crappy skater too :slight_smile:

Maybe there are more esk8ers outside of the city center, where it's safer and more adapted.

I'm still in the process of building my first board, I don't know any esk8 community in Van'

Actually dude, in LDP, people pay up to $800 for a nice bracket setup...in longboarding and downhill a good entry level board costs about $200 and a top of the line easily costs $500...That's a $200 deck, $350 for precision trucks, $100 for bearings, and let's estimate $100 for wheels, and then some expensive grip and hardware and it adds up quick. The boards you see in the longboarder magazine pictures all cost over $500 at least..and they are not even powered..most are custom made for the riders even..

When I use the word "skateboarder" I mean all types and kinds and forms of skateboarding. A lot of people just think of the flippy Popsicle stick riders at skateparks when I say skateboarder, but that's a narrow and naive view of it. Muirskate, the big online longboard retailer sells decks all day, 90% of them over $100 just for a deck..so this $40 deck thing is strictly speaking about "thrashers" or stunt skating where doing tricks is the primary focus. When your doing tricks, the person or rider is doing the work, not the gear, gear is less important and also becomes disposable and damaged often. Go look at the new top of the line skateboard decks though, Powel's new fiber laminate deck at $80 is actually catching on pretty well, they are finally adopting gear and ideas from the longboarders who have been fiber glassing decks to add stiffness and tune for years..

Most "skateboarders" are not scratching $40 for a new deck unless they just thrashed a deck within a week and with good reason, they shred hard, and they go through decks like toilet paper. this is why there are professional skaters, we thrash gear because we use it and need new stuff all the time because it wears out. But if you look at all of skateboarding, not just one of it's 40 forms, you will find people pay a lot of money for good quality gear and support a large and technical industry making awesome stuff. There's entire debates and arguments on FB about which $350 set of trucks to buy because there's so many options. Why are there so many $350 trucks options? I wonder...if people cannot scrounge up $40 for a deck?

this deck right here, just the deck, when it's said and done will easily cost $500 and that's without thinking of labor.

Carbon Fiber and exotic woods are expensive. When we went to the wood store to get the Maple and Baltic Birch, we walked out spending $100 and all we had to show for it was two sheets of wood to start making a deck from. Then you need a press and someone who knows how to lay fiber, it's actually an artform to make a deck well and it's a lost art to make a custom one for the rider. The decks in the stores and mass produced all over the world are made at such a low price and without a lot of thought, to complain about the prices of quality stuff is nuts when you look into how much it costs to actually make. Sure you can buy a Chinese maple Popsicle for $10, and they mass produce them for maybe a buck apiece. Most of the time you are just paying for the graphics or the brand name. The trucks I run right now on my prototype and training board literally cost over $800 to produce, that's not retail cost, that's how much we paid to make them. When your talking about titanium and steel blends or machining 7000 series aluminum instead of just pouring some hot metal around an axle in the sand, things start to cost money and for good reasons, and it's also really nice to know your doing it right, instead of half-assing it just to do it.  Obviously bringing the price down is a huge part of designing anything for markets, but realize that quality stuff costs money, and there's a lot of expensive things that make up a good electric skateboard. It should be in our culture and industry to want quality stuff, right now we harbor a distaste for what is out there in the market cus it sucks, and we should be voting with our wallets and not complaining, but buying quality stuff and putting all the crap out of business..in the end that will bring the cost down of all the parts so we can all benefit, we need to put a stop to this entry level cheap eskate market that is dangerous and actually hurtful to the real growth and future innovations we might benefit from.

Moved to Sioux Falls South Dakota and ive only seem one person other than myself but it was just 1 day havent seen that person since and that was  summer of 2017 so far people ask questions but prices send them away. Dont get it lots of jobs out here and almost everyone drive new cars. Nothing like Cali. Over there too many people on used cars and more eskaters.

Chico, CA. Hour and a half north of Sacramento. I created a Facebook page for esk8 in Chico, and have found a couple people that way. Caught up to a couple in the streets to get them to join. I'm extremely suprised how many there are. I know there are others around too, I've seen them before on Chico state campus. That was before I started riding so I have no idea where they are now

I enjoy being asked all the time about it and how much does it cost and more importantly how fast does it go... I know there are a few more Israeli people in the forum but no one is close to me... Electric bicycle is a big deal here and electric scooter are becoming more and more popular... I work in tech and it is very popular as a commuter... I really love passing them with my esk8 haha😄

Random community member hit me up for a ride the other day, cool dude and it was fun, he had a great DIY board...we ran into another eskater on the trail, younger guy without a helmet and a boosted board, he wanted to race, lol. We also ran into a pile of skaters shredding a traffic barrier a long the road with really nice cameras and a DIY cement ramp someone had put in to launch up onto the traffic barrier. they were ollieing over it, sliding and grinding it...it was sick. They wanted to ride our eskates so we let them, with a helmet warning but you know how skaters are, they came back wide eyed and agreeing a helmet would be appropriate for them, lol, but hey, we made friends with all the skaters on the trail that day, no mater what they were riding and no hate involved!  - Sacramento, CA

It might be. LA has to be the skateboard capital, but definitely not the esk8 capital. I’m in LA area along the beach with pretty good roads and decent bike paths. I ride with my buddy who has a Raptor 1 and a DIY board I built for him, but other than us I’ve only seen a half dozen of boosted boards and a couple evolve boards in over two years of esk8ing. Mind you there are regular boards everywhere around here, probably see 10-15 per day just driving to work. I think the perceived “cool factor” impacts what people ride here. My 16 year old son will ride his Carver board over an esk8, because the Carver is “cooler”.

On my campus I see at least 3 electric skate boards per day, I even know friends who had them before I built mine.  This is in AZ.  Its interesting that it is less common other places, but probably because college campuses are hot spots for that sort of thing, and here in S. AZ we have perfect weather for riding 8 months out of the year, and the other four are still ride able, just hot.  This being, I have yet to see a diy board.  Literally ever, not sure how this is possible, but maybe someday I will see one on campus...That's pretty cool some of you guys have groups and do group rides.  I have been wanting to organize a race, open class, any board goes, in the streets between two different points, but haven't really figured out how to get the people and organize it.  I think something like an alleycat race, but for esk8 would be pretty cool.  Imagine eskate riders everywhere, hitching  rides off cars, swerving through every road possible, fighting to make it there fastest.  It would be quite a site, but it would probably get esk8 banned in a few months, once someone inevitably got really hurt, so scratch that, lol.

This is a very interesting question for manufacturers, especially in the esk8 space. I'm in the process of bringing a product to market for the DIY esk8 community, and this is a problem that I'm struggling with quite a bit... how many people out there are actually _building_ their own board, and is it really worth it to make a significant investment when you are **just** serving the DIY community? 

I know that there are quite a few pre-built manufacturers out there, from the established brands like Boosted and Enertion, to the Chinese value brands, and finally being rounded out with the smaller 'startups' that you see on Kickstarter, IGG, etc. In my opinion this market is reasonably large, but it is quite competitive at the moment and isn't worth entering into as a prebuilt startup (cheer to Lacroix for pulling it off!) But the unknown gap to me is: sure, there might be a lot of people out there that would happily spend 1000 bucks to hop on a prebuilt board and zip around, but how many people have the technical confidence, or at least gusto, to build their own?

How large do you guys think the actual DIY esk8 market is? As in, to date, how many actual boards do you think have been built? I think the easiest way to estimate this would be to guesstimate how many VESCs or motor mounts have been sold so far (but then single and dual setups will blur this already poor guesstimation even more.) 

For some extra reference, it looks like, in total, there are only ~11k people registered on this forum, with very poor active user ship with only ~450 of these users being active on the forum in the last 30 days (stats from https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/about , someone tell me if I'm reading this wrong please.)

Anyway, just a question I thought I would throw out there...interested to get yalls thoughts.

As a quick addendum, I do think that the industry is obviously in its infancy... these boards really only started coming online with Boosted's kickstarter 6 years ago, and I would say it wasn't until this forum got on its feet in 2015 that there was enough of a community to make the DIY approach possible for the average person. BV's VESC contribution also was a huge factory for DIY. 

A great sign of future acceptability and popularity of eskating in general is that it is already accepted on the coasts (NYC, LA, SF.) As these things catch on in popularity there, they will eventually be more accepted globally and hopefully will become more popular. As the prebuilt market grows, so will DIY builds at some fractionally proportional rate. Celebrities like Casey Niestat are obviously helping as well, his videos receive millions of views globally and a good number of them feature eboards as a form of transportation for him, which I think is _very_ helpful.

I disagree.  They are not nearly as practical as e bikes or even the push electric scooters.  I could cover more ground with an e bike, and arrive with out being jarred to death by rough roads.  Also, if you truly want to use it to commute, like 8 miles or something, you are going to want to go at least 28 or 30 mph, which can be uncomfortable for people who didn't grow up with board sports, like snowboarding ect.  It often takes people who are not kids quite a bit of time to feel comfortable turning at 30 mph, and to learn how to slide on a normal board, because it would be kinda unsafe to trust the e board brakes only to slow down.  Even having experience snowboarding, dirt bikes, and a pretty good amount of skiing and being young and agile, it took me like 10 or 12 combine hours to learn how to slide, and a set of wheel which I basically flat spotted, chunked, and just ruined.  Now, I am by no means much more athletic than the average person, so i'm sure some could do it faster, but I am fit and young too which makes it easier.  Also, a normal board or really even a hoverboard are suitable for last mile commutes, so there goes that segment too.  Really, if you do not love riding it, it will not be your first choice.  I ride 8.2 miles of commute because it is a blast, and turns what would suck in to sometimes the most fun part of my day, but if it wasn't that I liked it so much, and had good roads, with turns, variable surfaces, like slippery surface gravel, big hills ect. to make it fun and different.  And im sure everyone here feels like I do, so it may be hard to imagine, but yes, its true, many people cannot or do not enjoy riding for 25 min each was, at 30 mph, on a long board, typing it out I cant understand why someone wouldn't, lol, but some don't.  So, I don't think the demand will grow enough to make as big as many people think it will be.  I think the real market is in dirt cheap boards people buy to just try and ride around their yard on.  Anyway, thats my opinion, but it very well may be way off, I would be curious to hear from more people.

I am curious how you jump up and down obstacles.  Is this with bindings, or is there a way to Ollie a long board that much, or do you just grab below your board and jump with your feet pulling the board up?  I can't Ollie a normal skate board that well, and have never been in to the traditional trick sorta skating thing, but would learn how to ollie better if there was a setup making this possible to clear curbs, that would be awesome.

@Okami as stated in my profile, I am from the capital, Vilnius. I know a guy who is riding in completely different side of the country and that's about it.

@Okami Huh, bindings do sound like they would make it a lot more stable in the rough parts, sometimes, its like my feet just wont stay in position.  i bet they would also give it more of a snowboarding feel.  Do you use a slip in binding, or the snowboard, type that ratchet down.  And how did you mount them?

Im having a mountainboard, so it was already there but there are some aftermarket options.

I have open ones, feet just slide in and out, so im not tottally locked in.

There's also freeboard bindings, they allow to only partly lock your feet in while still allowing to make jumps when needed (u can look these up, @okp uses them a lot, i think)
