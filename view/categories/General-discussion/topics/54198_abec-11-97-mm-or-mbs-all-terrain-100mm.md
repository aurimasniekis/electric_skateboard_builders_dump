Hey I have a TB 6374 single motor setup with Caliber 2 trucks running 83 mm wheels I want to have a set of bigger wheels.  I've read whats on the boards was looking for any current input and best places to buy other than just go to amazon. I mostly ride on pavement but some of it gets a bit rough and possibly a dirt canal path if a single motor setup with handle it. Your views on the wheels and places to purchase would be awesome.

The tread pattern likely helps them with grip on softer ground and on water.

Amazing grip, better shock absorption, longer lifespan, look cooler than any abec, available pullies in the market. 

It's the perfect wheel for esk8s

The perfect wheel for esk8 would be the Constrictor in a 109mm size
