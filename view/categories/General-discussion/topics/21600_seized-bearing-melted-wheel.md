Anyone ever have this happen to them? 
Went for a ride down the beach,about a 7 mile stretch,few hills up and down to get there nothing too steep.
Check my wheels every day,keep them just tight enough but not too tight,use the suplied washers on both sides.
The bearing friction burned through the plastic and now touches the bearing on the other side of the wheel!! 
Can't see how this happened "fualty wheel" maybe? 
Really fucking annoying as you can't just buy one wheel to replace it!!

I would say the bearing has failed and sized up which has then spun in the wheel getting hot and melted the plastic.

yeah looks like a seized bearing. just bad luck really. nothing much you can do.

although those enertion wheels are dirt cheap right now.

You should use spacer next time :slight_smile:

No between the bearings, like this:

Spacer inbeteeen the bearings. Like a little metal tube that keeps the bearings seated correctly. You can tighten down on these then.

Exactly the same happened for me. One of the bearings got so hot it melted the core...

@Lukas @bigben thanks man had them all along,wasn't sure where they went.
Will install them now with some new wheels so I can hit the road jack!

With this title It looks like the wheel was the problem, but it was the bearing. Imo.

@Lukas do you recommend bearing spacers on all wheels or just the back motorised ones?

This thread really threw me for a min.  I was thinking "did the spacer collapse or what" then I saw there was no spacer installed and was "ewwww, not good".  

You gotta have spacers and speed rings (what you called washers) on every wheel.  With the spacer there's nothing to apply counter pressure to keep the bearings upright. Without the speed rings the bearing will sit against the axle nit but, won't turn correctly.

You live you learn...won't happen again! 
Those bearings with spacers built in are ideal.

I've never used them, but it looks cool.  I just got some bones reds with spacers and speed rings off eBay for 12 bucks.  Might check em out.  I'll post a link when I get back home.

sorry @WARMAN I've change back the title to the original, because the issue here is the bering and not the wheel, also this could easily happen to anyone, specially people who using clone wheel, and I don't want someone with these issues to discard this useful thread.

Lol the bearing did melt the enertion wheel but all good man I wont lose sleep over it! 
Just want to make sure other people avoid this ..knoledge is key.

Yeah, but at least the bearing is now seated :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

since we are on the subject can I suggest those bering, they look like the zelous ones, but are genuine abec, and really work great.

Zealous bearings with built in spacers are my favourite. The pricing is very reasonable and they seem to last a very long time.
Other people seem to like them as well:

Anyone know what size spacers are needed to fit abec clones,enertion wheels etc.
I will invest in the bearings with built in spacers soon but may as well use these I have first.

I read that a lot of long board completes ship without spacers, which blows my mind. If I'm travellingat high speeds (downhill or esk8) I want to be able to tighten the nuts holding my wheels as much as possible... Which isn't possible without bearing spacers.

I've burned out a number of bearings when I had an Evolve. The guy at Evolve built it without spacers and when I called about it, he said they don't use spacers on the drive wheel. So I proceeded to ride it and burned my bearings and melted my wheel core. Abec11 let me purchase a single which was nice. Kept a close eye on it and had a few more bearings go bad, but replaced them before they seized and burnt. 

Called tech evolve again and talked to a different group of guys. Ended up going through my board and sending them pics. Found out I had some prototype wheel pulley that couldn't fit spacers. Caused a number of issues and he said probably contributed to bending my axle too. They replaced all the bad parts and sent me a new set of ceramics. 

Never had any issues after that. Great customer service. Just make sure you have your spacers installed, your belt at the proper tension, and everything aligned.

I use these, they work awesome with genuine Abec 11 flywheels and clones.
They have a thicker wall so they seat really well.

That pic of a bearing failure mean bearing had inadequate lubrication for failure. How one has inadequate lubrication is what, us, readers of this forum do not know about the history of the bearings you are usings.

I think the absence of bearing spacers can easily lend itself to a seized bearing- lube or not. If I tighten my bearings all the way down with a bearing spacer it still spins. If I do it without a bearing spacer it seizes up the bearing. Under load during high speeds, bearing spacers are essential in making sure this doesn't happen. You don't want a lot of lube in there, because more material lends to greater friction. Just my two cents.
