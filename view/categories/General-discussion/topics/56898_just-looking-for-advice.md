I’m just looking for guidance. Any suggestions would be appreciated. I have a 41in long board with 113mm off road wheels a tourqe boards 6355 with a 15mm belt and pulley setup. I still have to purchase a esc along with batteries. I was leaning towards 12s esc with 5000 mah x2. Can anyone recommend a decent esc that won’t break me. Thanks in advance.![20180526_222940|690x388](upload://lL7Q3dppvjIDhiTK1A9aIwE1lFD.jpg)

Look bud, we can beat around the bush all day but really the highest quality, most customizable and overall best is the FOC BOX($155). Do some research on it and you might come to like it as much as I do. (this is where i got mine)

With 12s battery I would go with FOCBOX as @sunnyD suggested.

Check this out  https://flipsky.net/collections/new-accessories/products/fs-esc-6-6 
Its a VESC 6 with built in anti spark and costs less then FOCBOX after the coupon. I think its a fairly good deal specially for 12s on 190kv motor.
Focbox could get fucked up with those specs.

I guess they got rid of it. It was there just a few days ago. Maybe ask them on chat. After the coupon it was $143 something.

Not hoping to derail the thread, but how did you get the wheel pulley for that wheel? Thanks!

Ordered on ebay it fits perfectly with the wheels.   Dumb luck I suppose. Took a little fine tuning because of the wheel holes but it looks and works great
