Hi everyone!

I have been looking for a good place to buy decks in Europe but I can't seem to find an online shop that has enough choice and good luck trying to find a physical shop that sells longboard decks in the Netherlands. The international options like Ebay or Amazon all have great boards but shipping just triples the prices.

So other Europeans, where do you get your decks from?
