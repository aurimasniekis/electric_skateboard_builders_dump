So I‚Äôm looking to replace my DIYeboard parts because of the fear of snapping truck. Looking to get new **trucks**, **motor mounts** and **sensored motors** for now. Any suggestions where to get parts that worth the money?
My definition of expensive Chinese rebrand is something like Mboards.

I have genuine caliber 2 trucks, and custom motor mounts. To my knowledge all of the reasonably priced electric motors come out of China, so it will be hard to find American or European versions that are affordable. That said I make little tweaks to my motors to minimize issues and increase reliability.

Thanks. Maybe if I can‚Äôt find any good sensored motors I‚Äôd stick with the 5055s that came with my kit. After riding the Mini X and V2+ I really like that smooth startup...

Excluding affordable, what US or European manufacturers are there for standard esk8 size motors?

And to be fair to mike beard he does take the time to put little paper stickers with his name on over the other branding.

Quick google search, this might be your best bet.  100A peak current, 75A continuous current (probably not a super inflated rating), optional termperature sensor, 137 Kv.  Casual $700.

Wow I‚Äôve read good things about the Ollin VESC throughout this forum. There‚Äôs Focbox and Flipsky 6.6 at that price point too, which one is better?

## \#18 Posted by: Jc06505n Posted at: 2018-09-25T00:08:52.687Z Reads: 146

The Focbox is more tested so you know what lions mouth your getting into. Flipsky is still new and has to go under the grinder on different boards and different conditions. While having a so far reliable reputation, I personally believe there aren't enough Olliins vesc out there to justify that its "absolutely the most reliable". At least compared to the focbox. 

So no one can really say which one is better as none of them have the same # of pop and outflow to justify comparing each others failure rate.

Hi! 
I'm Psychotiller.
When you guys/girls are done dicking around with caliber clones and bad fitting mounts that can't even be adjusted or need crossbars to keep them from moving around every ride, or rebranded motors with shafts that are too long and stripped out can screws, or hangers that are too narrow to fit bigger than 55mm motors...We should talk.
Oh! And by the way, the trucks, mounts, wheels, pulleys, enclosures, packs and decks on my site are made in the USA.

This is a public service announcement.

Both your press fit and clamp mounts for TKP & RKP trucks fit perfectly.
I cant see how anyone could install them incorrectly. 
Money well spent.

And they are still fully adjustable, It eludes most peeps here, but that's the reason we can mount up under every deck with any baseplate angle, without being forced into using big ass risers.

This is a logistical and expensive nightmare and credit to the man.  Oh and the only way to ensure that your shit remains your shit.  Trying to put something similar together in aus right now and feel your pain brother.  To do this you really have to love esk8 and have an understanding wife.

Those are inrunners with non standard size shaft, can ect. They are also not sensored. 

So far on the premium side I've seen hackermotorusa and scorpion power systems. Although still no familiar sizes and the hacker motors are also made in China.
