Hey there,

I want to buy some electronic longboard parts to add to the longboard I made from scratch. I live in London, England so I was wondering how long it would take for the parts to get here since this company is based in Australia. It would be very helpful if I could know ASAP.

Kind Regards,
Alp

For me, and multiple other people, US shipping was super quick from Australia- like 5-7 days...

I think England will take a little longer, but I doubt you will have to wait more than two weeks.
