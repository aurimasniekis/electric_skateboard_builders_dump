Hi guys,

Are there any places/shops in Shanghai where you can buy esk8 related items? Specifically 6355 motors and VESC. 

I'm based in Denmark, but have a colleague who often travels to Shanghai, who is willing to go out and do some shopping for me.

I don't know about Shanghai but Shenzhen is supposed to be the "silicon valley of hardware" (Flipsky is located there). Maybe you could order and have it sent to Shanghai and at least save on shipping?

Yeah, that was my back up plan. Order from Flipsky and have it sent to the hotel.
