I'm all for Argentina winning this time because this is like the last chance for Messi bringing the trophy home:tired_face: but still knocked out by France... I wonder if anyone have thoughts on the winner this time..

Bleh..Argentina didn't have much of a team in the first place, so they didn't stand much of a chance in a long WC run.

I'm not sure who to root for at this point, after Iceland got knocked out, but I'm definitely NOT rooting for Brazil or Russia. Maybe Uruguay or Sweden.

Yeah, but the minute the match is ended they tend to fill up with drunk a-holes too busy waving their flags and horning like mad penguins to pay much attention to the poor eskater so beware the time limit :skull_and_crossbones:

My call is the final will be France - England and France will win this cup 2 - 1
The individual quality of French players are outstanding, Mbapp√© is the next Neymar

Mbappe is talented but my god at the flopping...glad he got yellow-carded!

Belgium and France have outstanding teams this year...Goalies have been phenomenal. Could go either way. France though seem to be more on top of things and consistent through an entire game. Belgium...seem to be more responsive and are really dangerous when they feel the need to counterattack but slack off otherwise.

I'm just hoping England and Russia get knocked out today. Keeping my fingers crossed.
