Depends on the rider. Some people like them, some don't. I don't. I rely on well designed decks with micro drops to tell me exactly where my feet are.

I like the idea of greater foot stability, I just move my stance around a little too much.

I would love to try footstops. Keeps the foot in place when riding fast over uneven bumpy pave.

Completely depends on the deck.  Some decks: fuck yes.  Other decks: fuck no.  It's almost never iffy LoL

Depends on the deck.
I use one on my riptide because the front end has zero concave.

I'd say it depends on height and type of deck.  Tall guy on a drop down then no but flat topped carbon then yes but at the widest possible stance position.  Smaller rider would need these.  I wedge my feet into the lifts on my evo when i'm going for it but I'm over 6 ft so it feels natural.  Its a big advantage to be able to lock in though so yes good idea.

I have an old bushing foot stop on the tail of my board and it's pretty useful. Gives me something to butt up against for extra security on ass roads and hard acceleration. Also stops my prosthetic from vibrating off the kicktail.

No, it was a one time irrepetible custom carbon job by german manufacturer [313 Longboards](https://313skateboards.de/footstop/) for one of their team riders back in 2011.

Or just general question about how people feel about them?

Tis a question I suppose. @OllinBoardCompany / @chaka sent me one of their gorgeous footstops. Personally, I have never used one....although, there have been a bunch of times when a footstop would of come in handy, because sometimes it‚Äôs hard to get locked back in the same position if you move for some reason....I don‚Äôt think i need it for more grip and leverage

The best ‚Äúfoot stop‚Äù I‚Äôve ever used is foam under the griptape. I simply don‚Äôt like foot stops because it limits my movement too much for sliding and slashing my board. A deck with microdrops and S-bends in the rail is where it‚Äôs at in terms of locking you in. ![IMG_4272|690x384](upload://mssmiqNZs0DwY5keNPaiBtfbffc.JPG)![image|666x500](upload://osMZxnLgXPhFgLplw4EMGqkQlmI.jpeg)

They serve a purpose, much like clip in pedals on a bike. In DH you will see some foot stops that actually allow you to get your toe under the stop which can be helpful in competition. I like them because it saves me from looking down to see my foot placement.

Well I'm not a fast rider like @chaka and never even stood on a skateboard until I was in my 30's, so I like the foot stop because it helps me with my foot placement.  I can easily jump on my board and know where I need to place my front foot.

If I was going to use footstops than this is the reason why I would have one. Mostly because I'm pushing "Mongo" (what all the kids are saying these days) and I have a Jet Spud on the way :worried:.

I have a Mini from riptide. Hit up @Alphamail, he will get you set up.


I love having it on there, I don't use it all of the time too, I have a few different riding stances that I can shift into during my ride, my foot stop is there for harder acceleration. Its allowed me to get used to a faster board quicker and I am a much better rider now because of it.

I do feel like its a personal preference thing though, some people are going to love them, some are going to think they are the worst.

I'd say grab one from riptide, they are urethane so they aren't that expensive, and if you find that you love it and want something flashy, grab a CNCed one from @OllinBoardCompany

I never thought about footstops until this one time we had a ride through a parking lot NEXT to the beach boardwalk, I went through like 20 speed bumps and luckily I looked down because after a few bumps my feet almost shifted off the deck.

I don't have footstops now, but Hummie deck drops help and other decks uses the X-things so I that helps a bit.

Once we started making PSD FootStops I started using them and now I use them on all my setups except double drop boards and others that have a defacto foot pocket.  I ride a lot at night so knowing where the front foot placement is becomes really important plus I never have to look down anymore.  Since I move my front foot around a lot to set up for slides or comfort, I normally use a convex shape like the In / Out Mini, KoMotion, Out-Side or Aer-Out so I can reposition my foot around a fixed point.  People that don't move their front foot normally go for a concave shape like our In-Side or In/Out Mini which has both contours.  On really short technical slide or garage Indy setups I will use an Out-Side both front and back to lock myself in the center, directly over the trucks!  Let me know if you need a recommendation on which PSD footstop to use for your particular requirements.

Because I can 3d-print one I'm trying to think of a novelty shape. Like the idea of those "cogs" in the link above.

Also thinking of making it a digital button since I have a custom remote (and consequently a board/receiver on the skateboard talking to the VESC).

_Possibilities!_
