Hi all,

Has anyone every seen [this product](http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/Complete-DIY-Electric-Skateboard-Truck-Assembly-Motor-Mount-Mono-Drive-Mech-Kit-/162029188719?hash=item25b9b1366f:g:hBoAAOSwGYVXA8RG) before?  I'm based in the UK so this is a really good price for me, but I suspect it's not a great product.

Boy, doesn't it seem like the conical holes for the motor are drilled from the wrong side?

And how do you adjust the tension of the belt?

Al...

@empty I'm guessing you're right, but it might be good enough to get someone started on a low budget. I like the belt cover. 

For just a slightly higher cost, you could get @torqueboards [mechanical setup](product/torqueboards-single-motor-mechanical-kit/) and it would come with a motor pulley (this ebay kit doesn't) and much higher quality components. 

Enertion has a [kit as well.](http://www.enertionboards.com/diy-electric-skateboard-kits/mono-drive-mechanical-kit)

Thanks BigAl & treenutter.

Treenutter - I've spotted those already and will start a build thread at some point later today or tomorrow, as I've been pricing up various options including those, just if I could make a big saving, it's worth asking for those more experienced here for an opinion.
