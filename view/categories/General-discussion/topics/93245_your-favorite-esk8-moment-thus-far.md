I thought it would be good to spread some positivity on the forum and remember why we are all here. Tag a couple of people you'd like to hear from if you want.

What was your favorite/best esk8 moment to date? 

For me, believe it or not, it was laying the box down that contained my Evolve GTX and opening it up. That smell of bamboo, fresh griptape and rubber was amazing. It wasn't my first board but it was in a class of it's own in my mind and the sense of adventure it gave me was awe inspiring.  

It's something we don't really experience with diy I suppose. Most of our parts arrive in old sweet boxes (shoutouts to haggy) or shitty bubble wrap in dribs and drabs.

I obviously grew to absolutely despise that board and eventually returned it because it was atrocious and dangerous. But not even evolve can take that box opening from me (and all the swag that I kept)

@JLabs  @chaka - hit us.

When I tried a really powerful/torquey board for the first time and almost fell off :smile:. Now I am used to it and it is still really fun but I don't get that pure joy that I got the first time

My best moment thus far was when i did my range test ride on my hybrid style AT board. (pic below) the feeling that i built it and it performed better then the production boards in it's catagory (aka evolve) and was cheaper was incredible!![0417191704b_HDR|690x328](upload://Dr1F1rsRhmkK6OpRMTt8C3LtPp.jpeg) 

While on this note of favorite esk8 times today is my birthday and as i look back at this year the major highlight of it is esk8! It's amazing what i have accomplished esk8 wise this year and its all thanks to all of you that are part of this community so thank you!

The first fall I took while wearing my TSG Pass where I hit a fucking rock at 3 mph and managed to roll out of it without dinging my precious noggin cap.

Or maybe when my friend tried out my board yesterday and promptly shot it out from underneath him because he couldn't keep his booger hook from mashing the bang switch

Really hard to say, I enjoyed pretty every minute on my boards. Still get nervous each time I put my things together to go for a ride as I know as soon as left the road I push my board and me to the actual limits I can manage üòÇ...or sometimes not manage üôÑ I would say this years highlight was when I finally received the parcel from @sender with half of all the parts I need for my this years builds and I collected over half a year long.

I have to thank @revel_flo  for getting me excited about esk8ing I never heard of it before 2017. When I bought my first revel drive it wasn't even for esk8ing I was creating a powered roller suit. And I did but the prototype looks totally silly since I built on a very small budget and y'all ain't ever going to get  picks or vids of that nonsense. Once I decided to slap it on a magneto deck and learn to ride it I was almost hooked just didn't climb up the hills well. So I purchased another $800 unit and made my first 4x4. This was the bee's knees for me, I can't even go back to 2wd now...  ![sketch-1551856875419|666x500](upload://i9Wf0yHc1CXIpIPKdSQuAhQtDwo.png)

The first ride with my DIY build totally blew my previous wowgo experiences out of the water. Soft ride and more power than I could dream of (at the time) was amazing. That said the best thing about esk8 was finally getting my board all put together and spun up the motors. It's at 1am and we were tired of troubleshooting; but when it worked everyone yelled a "woohoo" of relief and success. That was the best.

Stumbling upon the VESC on internet many years back, realising the creator was doing his PhD at the same university as me. Then beeing invited to Vedders house to ride an esk8 for the first time(dual Sk3s, nearly shat my pants).
Riding with him in his neighbourhood with a smile from ear to ear. From that moment I knew I was hooked. 

Ben beeing super humble towards a soon to be graduate explaning the basics of motorcontrol enhanced the experience as well.

My favorite moment was when my first board after working on it for a year and a half finally worked. It only went 7 mph as I had used parallel connectors instead of series ü§£ü§£, but i still felt like I was flying. 

One that is almost as close to that one was my first group ride. Meeting all these awesome people that shared the same passion was awesome, and the adrenaline rush from riding in a group. Its was so cool to meet people Ive only ever know online. Im counting down the days till I can go on another one.

But for all good moments there is always a bad one, by far the worst was when I blew up my VESC. I barely had any money at the time and getting a new one took over 5 months. It was a very boring 5 month.

Really hard to say, too many good memories to choose just one! The day I successfully made my first VESC was a big one, talk about a rabbit hole! Feeling the direct torque from my isolated wheel pulley/bearing design for the first time. Hearing the angry growl from my first gear drive at 40mph and knowing it still had plenty of speed left, terrifying! 

Last Sunday my daughter joined me for a ride and we were both on FOC belt drives so we were able to talk during the whole ride. Seeing the stoke on her face never gets old!

I have been thinking about this since yesterday. Great thread.

For me it hasn't been one moment, it has been this entire community and culture.  This has been my first foray into real DIY of any kind, and the rewards are immense. 

I started this adventure at a turning point in my life, and I really needed something to pour myself into.  I have been able to learn so much, express myself through what I consider art of sorts, and spend time with my kids creating things.

So for me it is a lot more than building skateboards.  It is artistic expression, time for bonding, and therapy by being able to focus on something and continuing to learn constantly. 


All that being said, the first time I realized one of the esk8 legends, @mmaner also lived in Alabama of all places and the first time he came down to my place to ride boards, drink beer, and gossip about forum shenanigans was an awesome experience.  He has since come down many times.  We always say we are going to work on shit, but then we just drink, ride, and talk. It's awesome.

Also, seing my 5 year old rip it on his board we built was/is beyond gratifying.  He is my main riding buddy.

I have built some amazing friendships in this place.  Many with people I have never even met in person.  That is very new for me, and I am very grateful for it.

I am always one message away from a sounding board of awesome guys that I respect and enjoying fucking off with, even if many of them are from all over the world.  Hell, those nights I can't sleep, I am able to chat and hang out with friends in other time zones like those Aussie cunts üòÇüòâ.

This is a community of cool mother fuckers, with the occasional twat that makes for good banter.  I can't wait to meet many of you guys in CO this summer!

Either the time I towed my best friend for a full lap around central park, or a year later when he took his new boosted board into the park with me and we zoomed up the entire east side after dark. Group rides are such a crazy amount of fun, and the only thing better than the feeling of two motors pushing you up a huge hill is sharing that feeling with someone else.

Another strong moment was when I was at 4th or 5th street and realized I had to be at 86th in ten minutes. Easily the most frantic ride of my life, never felt so alive.

Except getting my first board, i guess it was in November 2017, the best thing was to sign up in here. Great thing for me to get in touch with people sharing the same addiction from all over the world and the possibility to get any information about the electrics and anything else about electric skateboards. Electrics never was my strengths, but I think with your help I will make it one day to take a step on my first diy board. Don't use Facebook or other social platforms at all (never)so it was a big overcoming for me to sign up in here. Did it because I needed something new in my life for deflection, because otherwise i had gone insane, i think. Since then i enjoy my reading time and hanging around with you guys almost the same way I enjoy riding my boards.Thank you for that!

My weight has always been an issue where although ive always had fast boards, when the group upgraded and started to get better and better boards i was falling behind on acceleration.

 I built my 4wd 6374 build just for that to be able to keep up with or beat most people despite my heavy frame.

Then came the drag race.

Raptor 2 - 170lb rider
4wd Evo - 320lbs

We both went full throttle and he just dissapeared  behind me from what i saw in the corner of my eye as i stuggled to push my body forward fighting the immense torque. 

When i stopped i asked him what happened why he didnt go full throttle and he told me he was going full throttle. 

Best moment ever.

#4 would be getting my first esk8, meepo v2p. #3 would be riding that sucker for the first time. #2 outta be realizing that it is possible for me to build close to my expensive ass dream build (but not the most expensive out there and costing a bit more than an evolve/boosted which is insane). #1 will be a combination of when I get all the parts over the next month or so and assembling the board and completing it and riding it for the first time. I can see that taking on the best moment, just as had the meepo for the very first time.

A looooooong time ago when I first saw Casey Neistat ride his Boosted board around New York, I thought to myself "that looks cool". Some time went by and I started to come across DIY boards on YouTube, which eventually peaked my interest in building my own. The first thing I ever ordered was a random 10s BMS and a FlipSky antispark off of eBay - I didn't know jack shit, I just went for it. I built a super ghetto budget board with eBay parts and not having ridden a skateboard ever before in my life I wasn't sure if I even would end up using the monstrosity that I just started building. 

But definitely the best memory was standing up on my first ever built board and pushing the trigger slowly and almost falling off, thinking to myself "what the hell did I just build and why?! This was a dumb idea.. ".

Now here I am, few years later and commuting to work on my dual 3500W motorized wooden plank of death. **These things still scare me.** :sweat_smile:

That thing in its eskating glory was a fucking death trap.  Holy shit I'm surprised you survived. Great big flubbery risers and angles all over the place.  When I first set mine up it had 5 degree soft risers and they were bad enough.  Crappy pivots and bushings on 218s too.  Scary stuff on a 12s beast.  It was wibbly wobbly woo and the fact that I was crapping my pants riding it  didn't help.  Shaky legs are not conducive to negating speed wobbles.  Got it pretty much bang on now though with lots of alphamail help and beer.
