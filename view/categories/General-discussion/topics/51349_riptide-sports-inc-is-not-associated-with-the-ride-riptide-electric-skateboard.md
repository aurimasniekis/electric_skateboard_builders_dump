Through a series of unfortunate events a company is using a name very similar to ours and continuing to confuse and complicate the marketplace.  We have been known for years as simply RipTide and Ride RipTide is attempting to capitalize on that.  We have repeatedly requested that Ride Riptide not shorten their name to Riptide but they continue to do so in blogs, their packaging, events, wheels and their website.  We are in talks with them to correct this!

Wow this is really upsetting. You guys have been a staple for years. 

Are they a US based company? You may be able to file litigation for a name in the same industry.

Indeed they look to be, and are out of California, like you, so you likely can even do such at the municipality level due to their location. This is a common theme with businesses in the same state, county or town picking like names to monopolize on prior business achievements..

From there indiegogo campaign:

I'd talk to Chris and shredlights and ask them to similarly apply pressure. Surely Chris is sick of this he gets ripped off all the time...

@Idle I found this riptidesports site but I don't see how they're selling fake rip tide boards, they only sell longboard bushings.

 I see they are using a very similar name, but there's talk on this thread of a rip tide clone catching on fire and don't see how this site could have sold any boards like that, as they only sell bushings as far as i can see

@pennyboard you have it all backwards

RipTide sports has been providing bushings and like to the skate industry for a very long time, and well known in the industry.

Ride RipTide is trying to capitalize on the ~20 years of RipTide sports success in the industry by copying thier name

You got your signals crossed mate. RipTide Sports is a reputable brand in the skateboard world that has been around for a long time but they don't have anything to do with electric skateboards. Ride Riptide is a very recent electric skateboard company who are marketing themselves as RipTide.

Maybe it's time to talk to a lawyer? See if there have been any violations of the law or something.

If it hasn't be done yet, that is.

EDIT : read up a little bit...if I'm understanding this right..what RideRiptide is doing might be considered infringement...

Generally speaking, trademark law attempts to prevent "risk of confusion" between 2 sources of products. Here, we're beyond that, there are actual cases of people who have confused the 2. So on it's face alone, you have a good case. @Alphamail, dm me if you want to chat, I'll steer you in the right direction.

This is some serious bullshit. Just the other day I was reminded about the Riptide R1 and thought it was weird that Riptide Sports (the real one) would be selling a cheap Chinese electric skateboard. Seemed kind of out of place for an established, legitimate company that specializes in high quality urethane parts. And now I know why. **"Ride Riptide" is a joke, and they seem to be purposefully misrepresenting themselves and misleading people into thinking they are associated with the original company "Riptide Sports" (who we all know and love).** That's fucking shameful and wrong. And they're the same guys that make Shredlights?! WTF is that about? This sounds way too much like that human excrement Alextech trying to make some scammy AATorque Systems, knowing people could get it confused with Torqueboards. 

@Alphamail, I'm sorry you have to deal with this, but I think you need to bring the giant lawyer hammer down on these fools. This is way too blatant and confusing. Your hard work and reputation to the unknowing consumer could be on the line. Hell, they even have a nice little wave line on their board that looks like a regurgitation of the lines in your logo. And if these are the Shredlights guys behind this, I know who's getting boycotted and blacklisted in my book. Disgusting.

so I did a similar dumb thing recently plugged 42v charger into a 7s2p (24v) it took a charge, seemed to take forever to complete (didn't charge just stopped after several hours) BUT it didn't catch fire wasn't even hot and it looks like I killed the BMS (I think still to investigate) I kinda assumed that this is what to expect - seems I was rather lucky (a fire like that would have destroyed my deckstack :open_mouth:)

I just want to say that although both companies use a common name which is deceiving to the uneducated consumer. I am able to distinguish between the two companies by insignia and font styling to know the difference one specializes in polyurethane bushing and the other is just another company providing an electric skateboard trying to be different, but the parts seem to be from China if they can sell it for the price they can.

Official statements clear any confusion.

Right now it boils down to the use of the name "Riptide", not the logos. And since both are considered selling "skateboard goods" or "sporting goods", it may be considered in a court of law that there is intent to cause consumer confusion. And that would be considered "trademark infringement". However, if they were in different markets, as defined by the law, then it'd be fine.

For me, the biggest gripe I have is that Ride Riptide refuses to mediate the situation, and it's obvious they know what they're doing and don't care. And yes, an official statement would clear things up and get them out of a hole.

But there's a problem I've noticed after perusing their website...and it doesn't look good. They are actually marketing themselves not as Ride Riptide, but as Riptide Electric Skateboards or Riptide Electric. They are introducing themselves to the press and the public as Riptide Electric.
Heck, if one hovers their mouse cursor over the top left corner 'Riptide' logo on their website, a pop-up window will say 'Riptide Electric Skateboard'. They only bothered to change the website address to 'rideriptide' and the subsequent email addresses to said website, but still call themselves 'Riptide Electric'.

And yes, all their boards are assembled in China. They claim that the board is a mix of off-the-shelf and custom parts, but it's obvious that the only custom part is putting a logo onto an off-the-shelf enclosure.

@Alphamail I always wondered about this, thanks for letting all of us know about the issue.

If both companies filed articles of organization in the same state there's a process to mitigate infringement on market space with the same branding through the state. Call CA's Secretary of State office and explain. If both companies honestly presented themselves in the incorporation phase the state should have noted the similar name and market and denied the latter applicant. You might not even need a trademark battle; the state can handle it without lawyers.

check out: https://llcbizfile.sos.ca.gov for information on CA state filings.

I’m not sure if you would be interested in this but maybe you could form some sort of partnership. You guys (RipeTide sports) sell bushing to Ride RipeTide and have them disclaim on their website that you are not in fact the same company but one that is working together. That way they can improve their board and you get promotion and will not be seen as the same company.

Just a thought

& then the confusion would rain supreme... :exploding_head:

The rip off merchants could use the real RipTides name, logo... every thing. What is in it for them? It would be like RipTide were endorsing the brand and the product. 
What happens then if a few more rip off boards go up in flames? :fire:

RipTide have what? 20 years of industry activity, sponsorship, support, brand building, American made... all at risk.

The rip off merchants are basically just distributors for knock off Chinese shit that RipTide is not interested in being associated with.

I gotta admit that this confused me a lot too.
I wondered why they would use the name rip tide when its been used so many times before.

its pretty far from original. 

but having said that, the guys from shredlights are great and original guys, who were probably looking for an affordable e-sk8 to get their product out. I don't believe they were trying to rip anyone off or fool anyone.

I got to admit I never heard of "rip tide sports" before reading on this forum and I knew of at least 2 other businesses using the Rip Tide term. its a pretty common term with regards to surfing so I guess that why a lot of people use it.
