Didn't find anything, so I'll ask

Is it possible to top&bottom mount batteries on a landyachtz evo 39"?
Or is there any deck which can?

I'm going to use the TB DirectDrive and TB 110 or maybe pneumatics
I could ask Dexter for a 35D Baseplate so it might work on a mountainboard?

Any suggestions?

The evo is just a top mount.

You could top and bottom mount the Evo. Its just gonna take abit more work. 

May I ask why you'd want to mount it both ways? You can mount a ton of batteries on the bottom as it is. Enough for even for a 4WD

I see. Well its just up to you how you want to wire the top mount. Either you drill through the deck or route it around the side. You’re just gonna need to be creative how you build that pack

my question is more; is it stable enough and how do i mount it?
should i install an adaptor plate (because of the concave) where i install the box on?
```

The evo is plenty stable for sure as its a Downhill deck.

I would suggest drilling a wide enough hole through the center. You can 3d print the adapter plate and mount it to the top enclosure which could be a pelican case or something but I’m not too familiar with the concave on the Evo so I could be wrong about that.

just didn't know as it's much weight with all the batteries

prob going to wire it outside, will need some testing first
is it still true that long battery wires will damage the vesc? will be using 2 focbox unitys
do you think it's a good idea to make them waterproof and mount them on top of the truck mount?
or should i use a casing? and is that ok with cooling?

as i wont have a 3d printer i wont do that but i anyway thought about a thin metal plate, i guess thats also sturdier than some printed plastic
```

I’d go with metal for sure over plastic in many cases such as this. Yes long battery cables can kill vescs which is why you want to use thicker wires coming from the battery. If you want to play it safe you can even go with 8awg like how @Andy87 has if you think wires are going to be lengthy

If you go top mount enclosure, look @ Apache and Pelican cases.

If you go bottom mount, just get a evo enclosure unless you're good at making your own enclosure. My opinion.

If you mean use a casing for the top mounted batteries then yes definitely. 

Not sure what you mean by mounting them on the truck mount. The evo is a dropped down deck not a drop through so there’s no hole on the truck mount to route the wires from the top to the underside enclosure

So what are you asking then? 

Are you just mounting batteries both top and bottom?

yes, i just wasn't shure if it's a good idea to top mount an evo

going for a lot of range...

I meant to have the Unitys separated and not stealing battery space

so i would just mount them on top of the truck mount

You can top mount most any board as long as there space for the enclosure. Check out Apache and Pelican cases. They have many sizes.

I think @Battosaii fit a 12s8p in that enclosure. 
That's over 90 cells you could do a 10s9p

Not an evo but it has the zame profiles. That Apache case hold an 8s3p lipo using 6 4s, plus an anti spark and focbox. All nice and snug.

is your board also 4wd?

i can easily get 80km range on my board. my group averages 20 miles on rides and i tend to ride fast if i start with 100% battery after 20 miles i usually have 74-78% battery left at the end of the ride, in fact i dont fully charge my battery anymore i charge it to about 80% now to conserve the battery.

You can mount the vescs on the truck mounting areas. I recall @kug3lis mounting it that way. You’ll just be doing it on both ends

btw if you go with a unity in 2wd set up you can fit a 12s10p in the enclosure

initially yes

that sounds exactly how i want it to sound :star_struck::star_struck::star_struck::star_struck:

isn't it worse for the battery if you don't fully charge it?

batteries have a much longer lifespan if you keep it in the 80-30% range no more no less

:heart_eyes:
i either pack one in the bottom and one in the top casing or mount both on the trucks, depending on waterproofnes of everything

[/quote]

Wheels are wheels to me lol. But having these, you ha e to treat them like vehicle tires. Rotate rotate rotate lol. As per the wheel and riding, I do like them but they are a little too hard for me. Then again that could just be Denver cracks lol. They aren't that good in AT settings. Like hard packed dirt they can handle. But sticks, rocks of the sorts will ause them to let go of traction. If say more low cut grass and dirt trails they are good for an semi AT wheel.

not droping them too low i already knew, but last thing i remember was that you should charge fully
but that's already some time ago

fully charging once in a while allows you to balance the cells and should be done every so often
