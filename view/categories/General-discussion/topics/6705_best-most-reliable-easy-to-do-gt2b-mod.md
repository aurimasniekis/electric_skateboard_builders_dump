No name yet. Please give it a name :relaxed:
Basically, It's the same mod as the bad wolf except no USB relocation is needed. I am sure you can find step by step tutorial available here.

i printed the original wolf and the new mad monkey and the mad monkey is super sturdy. Not super easy but doable if you're patient.

[/quote]

@MasterCho s being modest here; this enclosure us much better than Badwolf; It has cutouts to minimize the size of it; it's as thin as possible with no empty space inside. It's also a very sturdy build in thick plastic that feels substantial. Finally, there are no corners or sharp ridges, it is smooth and comfortable to hold, so it feels more ergonomic than badwolf. Great work @MasterCho !

@MasterCho any chance you can share the files? just for a personal use...

I don't think he would send the files. It is the best MOD for the gt2b, if you want something free, look at the mad munkey, it's not as good and you have to relocate the USB port.

imho the mad monkey is aesthetically more pleasing. But that's a matter of taste. :)
What makes it less good though? The relocating of the USB port or something else as well?

I disagree.  The best one i've seen is probably @okp's carbon fiber custom enclosure.  

I'm definitely a fan of @FLATLINEcustoms Mad Monkey, or @Qwiksand's Baby Buffalo (also a thumb throttle option!).  Those are my next two in addition to my couple badwolf v2's.

Plus they are free and continually improved by those gentlemen who are sharing with the community.  

No disrespect to @MasterCho (it looks well done), but i'm a fan of the community projects vs a profit model from a re-work like an enclosure for GT2b.

I am not taking away from the mad munkey or the baby buffalo, they are solid mods. But my opinion (and many many others) the @MasterCho mod is the best. You dont have to remove the USB port and I like the fit in the hand. Appearance dosnt really matter because it is covered up by your hand. okp's mod is fantastic but he's the only one who has it, so i dont think it is fair to consider his an option. Not trying to start a fight or anything here. Just my input and opinions.

I‚Äôve managed to buy a fs-gt2b but it didn‚Äôt come with the battery.  Does any one know the part number of the actual lion cell as I don‚Äôt really want to buy the extortionately priced fs1700 battter to just end up cutting off the connections and plastic carrier anyway.  
Also can any one in the uk recommend a online 3D print service.  The few local ones i‚Äôve Tried before always end up with a poor print with not very good tolerances.

Gone with another local 3d printing service and got them to do it in orange ABS.  I've also found a 900mA 1 cell lion battery from a old sony erison phone which fits in the original case hopefully will strip down and fit in the new enclosure.
What size and length are the two bolts you need for the mod.

The battery I was going to use was too big so I ended up using a BL-B5 890mAh 1 cell liion battery which is quite a common battery and cheap on ebay.  Dimension are **46 mm x 33 mm x 5 mm** so works quite well in this enclosure.

I don't think it was designed to be a right or left hand, it's just for the buttons and dials.

in the right hand, the thumb fits comfortably over the battery hump. It the left hand, the battery hump fits well into the left palm, so I guess it just work in both hands well
