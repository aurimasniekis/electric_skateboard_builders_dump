No place is safe to cruise around at night in LA, unless you live in Irvine.

dtla has some decent bike lanes but pretty uneven so wouldn't recommend at night unless u wanted to go slow. 

where in LA are you in specifically?

santa monica, venice, marina del rey, and beverly hills are all my nightride spots. i just got back from a ride down Via Marina from Washington Blvd in Venice. literally no trrafic, nice roads, nice houses, and quiet. doesnt feel like a crazy city at all down there <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/4/5/45d45360477e9eecabb54b5330952f90aa81acf9.png" width="281" height="500">
