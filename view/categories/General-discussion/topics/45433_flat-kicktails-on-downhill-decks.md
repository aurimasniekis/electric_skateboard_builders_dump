What is the point of small flat/unangled kicktails on longboards? For example the lush pinnacle:

I brought a symmetrical deck for my first build as didn't realise how much I'd miss having a kicktail for turning.

I am planning to change the deck to one with a kick tail (probably the Jet Vulcan 37.3 kick) however I noticed that there are a lot of nice looking DH decks with small flat kicks. 

Are these flat kicks used to turn the deck, and are they much harder to use, or are they just used to give the rider more foot room on the board?
