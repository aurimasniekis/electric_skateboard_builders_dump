Hello eSK8ers,

I need to order a new belt.  I'm on a 16T / 36T setup, 12mm width.  Of course, I do not have the belt with me and I am trying the figure out the standard length for such a setup.  Should I order..

280mm belt?
265mm belt?

Thanks for the help.

Which motor mount do you have? What is the centre to centre distance of the pulleys?

@torqueboards could probably help you the most. He knows all the specs of his mount.

I run a 280mm on my 16t/36t from @torqueboards with a v3 mount on one board and a v4 mount on another.

Thanks, thats what I thought.  Didn't want to order unless someone confirmed.   See, the thing is I need to order today.  There are rumors that CanadaPost will go on strike on Saturday, which means that unless @torqueboards ships them out today, I'm pretty much beltless for the whole summer!!!  

That would be very bad !

v4 you can run 255mm which is much shorter. Go with 255mm if your running 83mm/90mm wheels but we also have 265mm, 280mm if you want to run it longer.

They were shipped out today :)

Awesome, not sure what you had shipped with my kit but I ordered 4X 280mm this AM.   I use 90mm Flywheels.

Thanks

@EpicCel - I'll send you 265mm since the 280mm is too big. :) If your ok with it.

@torqueboards just wondering what's the difference if I used 280mm vs the 265 or even 255mm? I know the belt is longer but what are the benefits/disadvantages, etc. I just put together your V4 mounts with an RSpec 6355 motor and the center hole is a bit small for the washer that's under that C-Clip of the motor. Is this a known problem? Also I was wondering what else can I do to tighten the big clamp to the trucks? I am not a weak dude but I've tried my best without breaking or stripping anything. I did try the shrinktubing but perhaps I have to use more than one piece? There is still a ton of play on it at the moment. Just wanted some building tips before I slap on the electronics other than the motor.

It's just center distance between your two pulleys. Shorter is better just as long as you have enough teeth in contact.

Our c-clip is recessed on our motors. I've ran motors with the c clip being too big for the center hole before and it works fine and possibly the c-clip can get damaged but there's not much you can do.

As for the clamp, you'll need to fit a piece of the heatshrink on the curvature part of the caliber truck. This makes it more solid. Don't rely on just the M6 bolt without a heatshrink. Hope this helps. Please let me know if any issues.
