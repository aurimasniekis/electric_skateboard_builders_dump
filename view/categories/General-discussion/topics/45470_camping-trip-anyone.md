As Iâ€™ve told some of you over the few years that Iâ€™ve had this idea, where you build a box trailer for esk8 and buy a bunch of those eBay batteries and connect everything for INSANE range. Well, I managed to use a bunch of plywood and leftover parts in the garage to make something along those lines... without funds or batteries to do the extended range though, Iâ€™ll probably use this for an overnight esk8 camping experience! For example, I could:
take esk8 to train, train to Sacramento, esk8 to camp spot, esk8 back to train next day, train to Pleasanton, Esk8 to home! Good idea? Or am I just crazy :joy: I think imma sticker bomb it...

Not...crazy exactly, definitely interesting though! My question is how much range you expect to get, considering that your motors have to haul all those batteries along with yo' ass, not to mention yo' ass's camping gear? :wink:
Maybe you could add another motor to the rear trailer wheels to help push?

Ohh. Now I see them.  They weren't loaded yet. I got anxious XD

It's it stable being that high?? And what motors does your board carry?

I have no idea if itâ€™s stable, havenâ€™t gotten to test it at speed. My board is a single drive SK3 5984 so weâ€™ll see how inefficient it is XD

Itâ€™s horribly inefficient. Probably 20 miles of range with my battery...
As I said I only have one SK3 motor, and I have no intention of purchasing another. Iâ€™m pretty lightweight and the trailer actually rolls really well so I think it might be fine. Just not very much acceleration

  it looks so nice as is Id hate to see it need the castor wheel but even then with a castor wheel I have no idea how that thing would do.    be nice to have one that was super legit for long distance high speed riding!  if all it would need was maybe two castor wheels on the front, to be more stable, maybe that would be good.  or 4 castors might be a wild ride.

I have no clue how many batteries Iâ€™d need to actually make it up there, although itâ€™s around 100 miles so Iâ€™m sure your board could do it! Right now the plan is to take the train most of the way up there so that I can get up and back on one charge (I use a 10s6p config of the Same batteries as you atm). Do you know any other eskaters near sac? We should get a group thing going!

Side note: I was doing test runs, about to film a video, when one side of the mount snapped while going over a speed bump. I do however have an earlier video that I will be editing and posting later. The part that broke was 70% infil, and so far every part that I printed at less than 90% has failed. Iâ€™ll be getting this made of aluminum before any serious runs, but for anyone who wants to print it make sure itâ€™s at 100%

Probably but I would never trust a 3d part to my kids lives, unless it was fiber infused... I have no kids so this is fictional...but yea

Don't do it. You'll be riddled with dumb people that think skating in heels is acceptable. Or any other beyond retarded notion, that these idiots will defend each other tooth and nail over. 

Don't waste your time... You'll thank me later. Lol

And just so we're clear here...since they can't seem to read without feeling all the butthurt at the same time. 
I give you guys the benefit of the doubt, but when I said retarded I'm referring to 

b. informal
very foolish or stupid.
"in retrospect, it was a totally retarded idea"

Emergency brake would scare the sh!t out if me. Maybe even a low radio turning could be a nightmare.

If you install brakes on the trailer it might be safer but difficult

The idea sounds great.

Placing a tent in the box some food <3 batteries Oh and Break lights at the back :D  
then outrunning a bear on your longboard and then felling sad for the bear and letting him try out your esk8. On to the critical thinking point what will you do if it rains? And will that piece of plastic work why not steel?

I wouldnâ€™t go skateboarding on a potentially rainy day anyways... but the reason itâ€™s a piece of plastic is Bc I canâ€™t afford to get one cncâ€™d in metal at the moment. Thatâ€™s on my to-do list.

Nice, there is scope to ball hitch this which allows a lot more axial movement = good. I may take a shot but printer thermocouple says 300c at room temp right now

@Eboosted point about breaking is entirely valid, should keep weight light, or look into the vesc breaking threads...actually wouldn't it be cool to have one more motor driving the trailer hitch over a can link ðŸ¤”

This type of setup woukd be super for food deliveries

Almost seems like it'd be safer to make a rickshaw style trailer that you hold with your hand. You can even put a handbrake on it. Would be easy to toss it aside if you needed to bail.
It would be exhausting to hold tho.....
