On my to the train station I was coming arpund this corner a little to fast... And leaned in a little to hard..and lost my balance and had to run off the board but since I was going a hair faster than my little legs could keep up with instead of a tragic fall my body instinctively went into "Magic Mike mode" and did the cool power slide on my knees and then I popped right up... I guess I also used the controller to power slide my hand with out any scrapes there...  

Board crashed into the curb and came back at me and I grabbed it a was back off like.i meant to do it... I think people in the cars were like wtf is happening =P

1 fender died in the process and the headlight is still ok!

I‚Äôve leaned too far and fallen off before, glad to see you didn‚Äôt get too hurt. That‚Äôs what sucks about riding with mostly Evolve people, their Gullwings have a small turning radius that I just can‚Äôt do. 

But I do wonder how anyone falls like Magic Mike. No wonder people were looking at you funny. Impressive üòÇüòÇüòÇ![image|245x195](upload://semHRdMm1UwAJIQFBdDPkWQZS98.gif)

Haha.
Well actually still not sure when somone does "downhill".

Last refrence I got: "until you haven't qualified for an idf race you are freeriding" 

Don't know how I feel about that, but since we are on the subject.
Anyone coming to Kosakov or transilvania idf races?

Anyone of you on here?  ;)

I love you bro, but more than that I love your humble attitude to life. I think michi would thrash us both DH but it doesn't mean I don't love your attitude :sunglasses: best hope I got is out smarting him, which I did often to the kids on the velodrome...

I guess going 30-45mph down a hill, not being a pro. None of us downhill then... :/ I just do it for fun. 

Every hobby I've gotten into races it just burns me out
- autox
- drone racing
- cycling/marathons
Etc

I always end up easing out of racing, because I'm not competitive, I just like a good time and hanging.

Yeah my local skate scene died (escarpment surfers / onterrible longboarding forum) years ago.

I raced IGSA, as much as a 16yo kid could. 

Also Patrick Switzer signed my face so...

Totally fine, shoes were good, kneepads were good.

I did this like dozens and dozens of times before anything wore out.

Problem with sliding on kneepads is if you do this downhilling or in a corner youd be carrying a lot of speed into a wall or guardrail.. which is definitely not a good thing.

 @zpoole27 I think you actually accelerated after you came off your board.. beat the crap outta my desert slide for distance..

yeah I hear you bro but... competition is like the apple to adam & eve to me...
can't help myself... trying to scale back/find ways... skateboard safer than motorcycle? lower speed? safer than the level I was racing at in the velodrome...

I'm prob. fooling myself, half the reason I did the seachange, I don't like to loose... ever (I did years on the velodrome, never lost a race).

I don't like to lose either. My issue was I was trying to race and organize events, because no one else would step up to organize and my head not fully being  into your own race.

So I step back, and race with myself, push myself on my own. It's nice

yeah I hear you, it became a toll on my body, it took me 40 hours a week training to stay in front of the kids, I went back to uni, studied sport science (after chemistry science), got qualified under the AWA (Australian Weight Lifting Association (coach)) to sharpen my power & speed development through olympic lifting... it was unending... but not sustainable for my body in my 30's... Transferred lots I learnt to a mate I coached to a big fight in London 2012.

Honestly man I am equally exited as I am scarred ;)

Next stop is transilv. 30% max slope. You reach 100+km/h standing up. Tucked 120+. We will see how hyped I am about the whole idea after that one :smile:

Ye he is such a nice dude. We were so lucky he choose switzerland and our city as his new hub. Weekly sessions with him and slide jams helped me out a ton.

Its nice to see hes still shredding. Definitely one of the best riders and such a genuine guy. ES for life!

Greener pastures is a great little film. Its crazy to believe he started on the same hills in my hometown. Seems like he fully bought in after having a taste of those swiss alps.

You should ask him abour sydenham or valley road. He'd definitely have a nostalgic moment.
