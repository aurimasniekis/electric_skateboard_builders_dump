[THIS IS A COPY OF THE MAIN THREAD ON ESK8NEWS](https://forum./t/hyperion-systems-llc-has-more-than-2400-of-mine-in-parts-and-paypal-and-they-wont-respond-to-me-anywhere-where-are-they/9315). Feel free to comment here as well though. The more exposure the better.

\~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I planned writing this in two days or so, but what difference does that make at this point?

Before writing more, I want to make it clear I have gone above and beyond what should be required of me to get their attention. Unfortunately I feel as though I have no choice but to post this to achieve the results I deserve.

The goal for this board was to get a top tier eboard, but since I was strapped for money at the beginning, I had to start battery first then eventually other parts as I got the money for them.

_________________________________________________

Below are the PayPal purchases I have made with Cory for this build:

February 18th - $650 - I purchased a 12s7p 30q pack from them with no BMS, as well as an eboosted enclosure. **I have NEVER seen this pack, not a single picture or anything to indicate it has actually been done. This is the ONLY progress photo I have received, besides ones of lain out electronics:**

June 7th - $650 - I pledged money for an Etoxx Helical Gear group buy, **that eventually fell through. I still have not received this money back. Its been a MONTH since I have asked for this, and have only heard ‚Äúyes we are processing it‚Äù.**

July 26th - $360 - I paid for two Maytech 6.6 200a VESCs. **Still in their possession**

________________________________________________________

Below are credit/debit card purchases that I had sent to them. I don‚Äôt know the dates, but Ill try to list them in order:

Kaly Deck - $270 - This was the most absurd part of this, and honestly its the number 2 reason this build has been so delayed. :sleeping: **Still in their possession**

DieBieMS - $120 - From the 3rd GB, **still in their possession**

Trampa stuff - ~$70 - Trampa baseplate, screws, washers, Hypa hubs, Urban treads, etc‚Ä¶ **Still in their possession**

GPS Tracker & SIM card - $15 - Just a regular ebay tracker and SIM card. **Still in their possession**

Metr Pro - $45 - A regular UART Metr **Still in their possession**

OSRR Remote - $225 - They‚Äôve had it for awhile now and even though Ive asked multiple times for it to be sent to me, its **Still in their possession**

The communications department has always lacked with Cory, be it a week between responses or what feels like ghosting. Currently I haven‚Äôt received a response in 17 days and counting, after I asked them for an update on where my refund and OSRR remote are. I have been legitimately blessed with @DerelictRobot s help, as he said that he would happily accept the parts and assemble the board as no one should have to wait this long.

I have given them over $2400 in items and PayPal, and have received **one** *good* photo, poor CS, and an empty spot in my board quiver. Where are you Cory and Benjamin? @hyperion1 @hyperion2

I would also like to shout out @BillGordon for being the homie on this situation. Its nice to know someone has my back.

Update: Just bringing the thread up to speed to the other one. Cory has responded, I'm giving him a fees days to get to me ü§î

It can expire...?

You have 180 days to make a claim via paypal. Option B would be your Bank.

Update: Cory has been in touch both in a private thread and in the sister post over on . The upshot is that they have been in the Bahamas and without communication capability until now, and intend to get everyone with outstanding issues taken care of soon.

I placed an order for 4 motors  from cory and I'm also not getting replies.

@hyperion1 @hyperion2 I placed my order on August 10th so in 5 days it's going to be 2 months, come on guys I know you are busy but this took too long so I had to order fromNaytecg directly and already got them.
