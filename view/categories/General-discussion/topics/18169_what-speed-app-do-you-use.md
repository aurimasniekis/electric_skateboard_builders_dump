Hey guys!  I've just clocked 100 miles of riding in the last 2 months :smiling_imp:!  I've recorded my speed and miles road with an app on iOS called, Speedometer.
Before I continue on to hit 200 miles I wanted to find out what speed/distance recording app does everyone use?  My biggest frustration :angry: with this app is that it doesn't record my cumulative or life-time distance on the road. So, I end up adding up each ride.  Yea...I don't want to continue doing that, booooring :unamused:.  Thanks everyone!

That's cool!  Is it a paid or free app?  Either way, thanks for the input.  I'll go check it out now. I need more options that what I already have :calling:

I think this one is nice.. sadly only for iphones :slight_smile:
Lets you record a video + gps data overlay also, I think

--

Check the forum there was a topic / thread similar to yours already

I got runkeeper personally.. lets me see my top speed also + average speed.. Rides get saves and you get a ''display'' for each week's total I think

It has the same name as mine but per the screen shots looks way better and more comprehensive.  Does it show you life time totals?  This is a really good contender.  LOL, I may have to try them all first.  Thanks for the response :slight_smile:

Hey bro!  I appreciate your input.  Love the @Namasaki knowledge!   Does it record your life time miles?

Awesome!  Thanks brotha! Looks like I may need to have a couple different apps till i know what I like haha.  But, the I'd rather do that then waste my time searching and trying ones you all haven't tried.

It doesn't record lifetime miles. It only records and saves sessions.

I second the SpeedTracker app. No lifetime miles though.

Hmm, I may need to just do with out the life time miles and just do it the old fashion way.  This saves me a lot of time digging through the app store.  Thank you!

Can share with friends / fb if you like.

Ohhh, shoot. This looks about right! Thanks for sharing brotha! That life time miles is huge for me as I'd like to know how long I go between wheels. We're kinda all analytical freaks in here right?

Yeah, i really just wanted the lifetime miles, but since I travel, going back to see rides on the maps is gonna be cool. 
Just remember to start it before you ride!

Just downloaded and love it.  Only thing that looks like it's missing is top speed.  Am I not seeing it or does it no exist?

It shows top speed  on the individual runs, not sure about overall.

That's funny cause I've used Runkeeper for running since it's inception.  However, do you think it translates well to esk8?  I really like @SageTX suggestion of SportsTracker. Really dope app and it's everything I've been looking for!

Runkeeper is great for what I use it for.  Average speeds and top speed don't interest me much.  My focus is how many miles(so I can gauge battery life), gps route, and simplicity.  Like you said though, it's cool to be able to use the same app for running and skating.

Ahh, I see.  Those are some good metrics to pay attention too.  I haven't done those type of test yet but should.  Now that I think of it I've really ignored that cause I'm always concerned about top speed.  Thanks for the perspective, now I have more fun metrics to pay attention too :calling:

I use the Cyclemeter app and I have tried the apps listed above. I find it to be my favorite. I like all the graphs I get and the running total. Plus there isnt a login. I wish it had a color coded map though like snoway but I couldnt find snoway on ios.<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/8/1/819e43ecb20eee0d77f34a9620e733e8eddb9e0d.PNG" width="281" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/e/8/e84dd75684aec9cd7a285b38afff3c7dd458c917.PNG" width="281" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/8/e/8e09f7e0e49920cf22b0b534f4be4304ba38779e.PNG" width="281" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/1/4/14412839b1e2ca42b19677aa2243dc3a86497729.PNG" width="281" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/f/4/f49f1d689ae2792193c0e9da9fe90a368456245d.PNG" width="281" height="500">

@CaptainMerricka thanks Cap!  This is a serious app!  I've recently enjoyed  SportsTracker that was recommended by @SageTX.  It has a real clean interface and has everything I've wanted.  However, you're app is very competitive!  You mentioned that it doesn't have a long in.  May I ask then how or if it saves past runs?  I'll be downloading it shortly and give it a go.  thanks for the response brotha!
