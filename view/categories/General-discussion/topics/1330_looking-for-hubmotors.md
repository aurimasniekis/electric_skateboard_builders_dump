Hello builders,

I'm looking for a set of hubmotors, mainly because i want maximum stealth and like the clean look.
But unfortunatly i'm unable to find a set for my liking.

The supliers i know of:
- CarvOn Skates (way too expensive for my budget and i don't like the motors coming outside the wheel)
- Jacob's Hubtor from this board (still in development/preorder phase/preorders already gone)
- Hummina also from this board (currently out of stock, possible restock in a month)
- esk8.de (still in development, should be coming out somewhere in March)

Are there anymore suppliers that i am unaware of? Or does anyone want to get rid of their set? :smile: 

Greetings!
Justin

Well I believe you've mentioned all, maybe there are some more out there (not in this forum).
If budget is your concern together with the look, then you might opt for DIY (make own hub motor).

At least I know 1 supplier which can be quite reasonable but not known for the quality.
It used to be in Aliexpress, but not available anymore I believe.

The last thing you can do is patiently wait :smile:

I also wanted a stealthy, clean look to my board [which I detailed in my blog][1]. The Carvon hubs, in my research, has the most user experience which trumps budget in my opinion. Documented user hours holds more weight for anything I purchase, especially in DIY. After putting at the very least 50 miles on it so far, I can fully appreciate the design of them. It feels "natural", like I'm riding on a wheel and not on a motor covered with rubber. My only experience with belt drives has been on the Boosted and E-GO but it's enough to make me want to stick with hubs in the near future. And I'm not talking from the perspective of a guy living in sunny California or down south, I've ridden this thing through the torn up streets of Detroit to the rock salted roads of Ann Arbor in 0 degree weather with my hubs holding up strong. But I digress, talk is talk, it didn't happen if it's not on video which is why I'm pretty much shooting a new video every week.

I'd go for Carvon. Carvon uses 6374 motors which are much better and will heat up less. I wouldn't recommend the hub motors for hills higher than 15% incline at 180lbs+.

Carvon is perfect for flat grounds though.

The other hub motors are only the length of the wheel which is nice but can heat up quicker due to a smaller can size.

Hmm, i guess i'll just wait it out for that kind of money... $600(!!) for a dual motor setup compared to Stary board selling a complete electric skateboard for $499 usd, thats sounds insane imo (and i would even have to pay 65 bucks extra in shipping). But thank you guys for the great advice and i do believe that Carvon's products are surely awesome, but the prices are just to steep for me. I guess i'll go look for other (cheaper) options, maybe fall back to a belt drive system.

@RunPlayBack Have you actually ever used belt driven electric longboard? if you tried them, what do you think in comparison? There is one thing I dislike about belt drive is the heavy drag when the electronic parts are idle. So during normal kick push it gets really heavy. I really want to know the difference of kick pushing with hub motor. If anyone else have the experience please share it :smile:

I own a Yuneec E-GO and have used a Boosted Dual several times. Agreed on the belt drag, hub has a more natural skateboard feel. What I like about Carvon's single hub is that I have a lot of confidence hitting my top speed because of the coasting ability. It's a big reason why my riding style is leaning towards fluidity around obstacles instead of brute force and distance. Even if I lose receiver reception or there is some other electric dropout (which happened when my VESC settings were off) I don't get thrown off the board and I can maneuver my way out of danger. My board is pretty heavy with the Space Cell so I don't typically kick push it home or anything but kick pushing on startup is a very smooth transition, like a typical longboard. I don't get the neck snapping torque that the Boosted and some cases the E-GO does on startup, but after hurting my back from a fall a few months ago, it's something I don't really miss. I enjoy a smooth acceleration and smooth coasting on my non electric board and I like that the hub resembles a similar feel.

@Justin Actually if you count it good, the price for dual drive is pretty descent.

Practical DIY requirement to get Dual HUB in comparison to Dual Drive Belt
- 2x SK3 Motor (Avg 70 € * 2) = 140 €
- 2x Motor Mount (Avg 100 € * 2) = 200 € USD
- Caliber / Paris Truck = 70 €
- 80mm Wheel Set = 70 €

Total Cost 480 € not inc your own work, hence lets say dual drive carvon is 600 € is 100 euro additional crafting cost. I think 100 euro extra cost from getting a dual to hub is actually very descent for the stealth look as well as less drag when neutraling. I am not surprised if it could get you a longer distance travel compared to belt.

Yeah i guess you are right, i was thinking from a perspective that its only a motor wrapped with some urethane. But its not that simple. I've looked into the CarvOn's a little bit more but there still things that i'm still not 100% sure of. 

1. It seems like they produce an awful sound when braking/cruising (see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qpz_64a4vyc) is this true or how are the CarvOn users experiencing this? @RunPlayBack (that would defeat my stealthy purpose)
2. How is the braking in general, any slower/faster than a beltdrive system, even with a single hub?
3. Is the urethane wheel replaceable when it wears down?

Thanks again for the info/help, if i'm going to spend so much money i want to be well informed :grin:

1. Braking sound comes from motor but triggered by ESC. This is what 150A small RC Car ESC braking sound like (from my experience), but VESC doesn't have braking sound.

2. This is not something I could answer.
3. Yes it's replaceable, I've sent them an email once asking same question. It could be difficult though as you might need special tool for it, but they are able to guide you with it.

1. Awful sound is rather subjective, have you ever heard what an electric skateboard sounds like? I mean it's not what I'd consider pleasant but it's also not the sound of a Harley roaring down the block. The sound actually varies depending on components. With my VESC and FOC mode it's nearly silent.

https://www.instagram.com/p/BAs4zO9NHo2/?taken-by=rikcordero

2. I have my VESC settings optimized for the Space Cell so my braking is a smooth transition similar to how I described acceleration. This helps to preserve battery life and is probably safer for me than hard brakes. I'm more aware of my surroundings and won't get thrown off the board by accidentally hitting the brakes. All of this relates to lowered friction and drag.

3. Carvon offers replaceable wheels and Jerry is pretty adamant when it comes to service and repair.

That silence is really awesome! But from what i understand from all the scattered info, FOC is still in development, not really 100% usable yet, is that true? I have not heard an electric skateboard in real life yet, so my opinion is purely based on youtube vids with crappy sound.

I've checkout out your builds and your video's are insanely awesome, really making it hard for me to not just take the plunge and buy the Dual Carvons and a s.p.a.c.e-cell and get along with it. The only issue right now is money haha

I'm still debating if i'll just wait another month to see what esk8.de 's hubmotor is going to do (and in the meantime save up some cash). Mainly from a logistical point of view, that would be a lot better for me, being that they are in a neighbouring country from where i live. So shipping/service/repair etc. would be a lot easier on the wallet.

Arghhh decisions decisions decisions...

It just gona get harder... Since it's new, no one review that hub motor yet. Even if there are, only a few would have tested it (maybe one or two). That doesn't involve if later on problem can occur (just like enertion remote that some people found it abit uncomfortable with the throttle). You never know.

We (esk8.de) are testing since 6 months now. You can be sure that it is in our own interest that those parts deliver what we expect, since we have to comply with local European law regarding warranty of 2 years and so on. This is a risk we are not taking if we are not a 100% sure. 

This is also a fact for the VESCs we are manufacturing and selling too. They are compliant with a lot of certifications like DIN EN ISO 9001-2000, PERFAG, IPC-A-600F, UL, RoHS, WEEE. This adds to the manufacturing cost though!

Beside that we have other main jobs and don't want to start some sort of big business here. It all done in our spare time.

Strange that I write a fellow German eboard scientist, on English in a forum from a guy in Australia when we are both active in the same German forum in Germany :smiley:
I just think the range and the community are better here, even a lot of members are from Europe so it is your market.
Anyway, why I write!
I think it would be great if you show something from your hub motors. What have you planned about release and kv?
I'm planning to build a diy board and some hub motors from you in Germany would fit great 😉

We will have two lines of hub motors, one is already known from @Hummie and the other one is our own development which we are still working on. As soon as we are ready I will describe them in detail and we should be able to sell them  around mid March. 

Specs of the second model will be <100kv, designed for 10s and 12s, customized 63 motors, single or dual operation, already mounted on trucks (2 or 3 different brands), exchangeable wheels, maybe as a "ready to drive"- kit containing VESC and batteries, I don't know yet. 

I'm living in the same city like the Mellow guys, you know. :wink:

FOC is useable for me except it caps top speed at 18mph. I switch between FOC and BLDC depending on the environment I'm riding in. That's the beauty of the VESC.

I'm currently in the process of a dual Carvon / VESC / Space Cell / Jet board almost identical to my single just slightly bigger.

I'm approaching my eboard builds very similar to how I approach my camera equipment. I could choose to wait for the next thing, and the next thing, and the next thing after that but I don't want to wait. Technology evolves so fast these days. I'd rather live in the moment right here right now, experimenting with visual techniques to communicate the joy we feel when we ride. Rather than pontificate or debate about specs on a forum I'd rather just ride and film a video. It's the ultimate expression of this kind of activity.

sensors just tell the speed control where the motor is and which phase to light up. once the motor is turning its not that useful, but if the motor is stationary it helps to get it moving smoother.

Why is the FOC limiting you to 18 mph? I haven't tried the carvons in FOC, but I have tried hummies in FOC and no limit as such.

I tried my modified space cell (pulling 50 amps instead of 30 amps), which is a 10s. Ok success, but then I tried 2x 8000 mah 6s zippy lipos in series to get a 12s, which can pull more amps than I need, and at 12s with the lipo, they are beasts. Torque is great, speeds are pretty good (haven't really topped of the speed yet).

yes, the drv and mosfets get hot, that is the limitation of the v4 vesc which will be fixed in v5.

How does FOC create drastically more heat? It seems like it should create less. RunPlayBack mentioned nothing about heat. It doesn't seem like a heat issue to me, cause if it was, when he hit 18 mph, it would roll back, and be un-usable for 15-20 seconds. Then the problem would come right back after less than a minute of riding, even if he never gets close to 18 mph. The carvons are also more efficient as they get to higher speeds, since they are 149 kv with no gearing. So as the speeds increase, you should get less heat per amp, no?

Have you ever experienced heat caused draw back on a vesc before?

If he's getting that at only 18 mph, I would imagine it could be experienced at lower speeds with slightly more time, and it wouldn't be practical to ever use FOC, since you wouldn't get much riding time before heat becomes an issue.

the drop on speed is speed is a big one, the culprit here is the DVR8302 once it gets hot does not work properly.

how do you monitor temp while riding?  youre not riding at full throttle carrying a laptop I imagine!  Id like to check on this temp increase also.  with just my fingers checking the fets occasionally I notice almost no heat.  not so scientific.  I thought that's where id most likely have heat build-up, no?  im on foc too
(constantly second guessing potting these)

no offense, but the temp argument just doesn't add up to me...

You wouldn't just get a limit of speed at a certain point, you would have issues with riding at lower speeds for longer times too. You also don't want to keep pushing that upper limit, can't be good for the vesc. So it would make FOC useless for the carvons, which would be a big downside of the carvons, as I don't have this issue with hummies motors. I have been up to 25 mph so far with his motors in FOC, and no draw backs from heat with the vesc.

Also, the carvons become drastically more efficient as the speed increases, meaning you need less torque for the same increase of speed. less torque means less amps, and less amps means less heat. Yes, as speed increase, even with more efficiency, you still get higher amps than before, but limiting at 18 mph seems extreme for the heat. I have a feeling the bottle neck is somewhere's else.

Have you ever experience heat induced draw back from the vesc before? After 15 seconds of waiting after the heat draw back, you can't go very fast at all before heat is an issue again. It makes riding at any speed difficult once they get hot.

Plus, if heat was the issue, there's ways of dissipating the heat, and removing that issue. So it doesn't add up in my mind unless I'm missing something...

@Hummie for monitoring temperature on VESC  all you need is free afternoon, Velcro , usb cable and laptop. 

@evoheyax  the temperature "argument "is an observation of the BLDC temperature feature of the components in the VESC that can be monitored. after a series of rides with the same setup and just changing from BLDC to FOC. I was not using carvons but u have sk3 6374 motors wich are the base of the carvons. 

This observation does not clear the issue about the drop of speed or the temperature behavior but the fact remains that in FOC mode there is the drop in speed and that the DRV8302 keep getting failing while on FOC. 

So lets get more people riding with laptops and try to figure this out.

Are those with drv failing getting them from chaka? I have a feeling they are subpar drv chips, and that is why. Niether hummie nor I have had any issues with hummies motors in FOC, we're both using chaka's vesc's.

I might wait until the v5 vesc's to get a pair of VESCs for the carvon's, as I'm sticking with hummies motors for the vesc's I have. v5 might also fix this problem :)

None actually did tests to compare all the hubs that are on the market....but most of those hubs are total shit. It seems like right now ENERTION RAPTOR 2 might have the most efficient hubs, but they are not selling them apart..so besides that ..you need to wait for CARVON v3's. which will be awesome.

Well thanks for that clarification. I wasn't aware of that. I also see they can reach 31mph which is impressive. 

I guess with the setup I did you have the benefit of using standard trucks that are readily available and a very affordable durable motor. 

What does a full truck wheel and motor setup on carvon v3 sell for? 

I do the full setup for $350 including wheels with a proven 28mph continuous run.

I may make the next set of wheels 110mm just to claim the largest in the industry 😆

Motors and wheels are available NOW!

I know the Carvon V3 buyers such as myself are interested in larger format wheel options in ABEC some format if you head in that direction. They won't need the hub motors though, just the wheels lol.

That's cool I'll make a wheel for the carvon v3 that outperforms the Abec 11. 

Can the motor pull a 115mm diameter?

I'm still working on the company that can take these ideas and put them into mass production here in the USA. That will bring prices down significantly. My goal ultimately would be to get you guys large diameter wheel sets at 60 bucks shipped.

Maybe someone could attach a raspberry pi mini to it and collect some data through BLDC...
