What you think about this board ? 
the company in china makes boards with polymer batteries with a thickness of 10mm deck and weighs only 6KG, range 18km with max speed of 40km![image|685x394](upload://jarO9vtXm66S1Cv4T5C6GjcA7R4.jpeg) ![image|281x500](upload://c3Rl9zFmJGvWb5A6gC0CrNi902R.jpeg) ![image|281x500](upload://tBJ6VbLmhFRe2BNb98KjGqSNCHw.jpeg) ![image|281x500](upload://8wtjm6J41mn3v1dKRhaCFoC3b6g.jpeg)

Ask company for individual lipo cell specs, otherwise this is a waste of time.

Edit, itâ€™s pretty, but Iâ€™ve been disappointed by no-name Chinese boards more than rando tinder dates. 

Their profiles lie. Go ride it for science and report back in AM please. ðŸ¤™

"Battery made by Sanyo" is the typical chinesium way of conveying scientific electrical specifications.

We want numbers and discharge graphs, weights, model numbers, electrical parameters, and chemistries.

You can tell right away if they deal in "Mega Amp Henries" or "MAH" that they may not know what they're talking about.

Curious about this one too (putting the 'best electric skateboard ever made' joke aside)...

Wasn't planning on buying it :) just curious what the performance would be like with the planetary gearbox..  plus it's a super stealthy build.   It's been cancelled for now by the looks of things anyway...
