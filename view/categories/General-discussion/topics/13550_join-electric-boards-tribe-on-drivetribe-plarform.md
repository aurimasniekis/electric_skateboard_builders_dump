I secured a tribe on DRIVETRIBE about electric boards. The platform is now in private beta, but Monday will open the floodgates for everyone to join. It is expected huge amount of traffic.

(for anyone who does not know about it, DT is the new social platform by Clarkson, Hammond and May - their new show, The Grand Tour broke all records on Amazon Prime last Friday)

In short, the platform is like Instagram but with cars, or everything motorized. A tribe is an open community about a topic where everyone joined is free to post content, or closed like a youtube channel where only the author could post.

Anyone interested to see or join, here is the link:

Guys, I think this is a vert good way to get more exposure for the eskate community.
Being from the beginning on the platform there is higher chance as a community to grow.

What do you think guys?
