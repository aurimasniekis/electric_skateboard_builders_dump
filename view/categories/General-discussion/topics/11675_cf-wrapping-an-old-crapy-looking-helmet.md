I have a bunch of old crappy looking helmets, I might CF wrap all of them. This took me like 4 hours. Heat gun, sharp blade and a lot of patience is all it takes. I used three different sections for this project.

Is it possible to wrap the helmet with one sheet? I have seen people doing it with very complex shapes using heat gun.
