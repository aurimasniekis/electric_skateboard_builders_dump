Yea I've seen this. The same person did a very similar thing last year with a flying carpet. Friends with Casey Neistat. This was a Boosted Board.

You could see the wheels the whole time. Kinda ruins the affect of him floating. At least with the magic carpet you couldn't see the wheels so he looked like he was floating.

The amount of time it took to put that costume together, he should have colored the wheels black.

That's what I'm saying. I feel like since he didn't have to paint it he just sat their it did not mean as much to him.

I thought that guy looked familiar I remember the magic carpet. I see what you guys mean about the message. I agree this is an impressive costume stunt, the eskate part not so much. I think we need to see true commuter vloggers on custom boards, I'm working towards that with live media. Good thoughts guys thanks for not tearing me apart for posting something kind of silly.
