Thanks to all for the help with my battery, it is alive now. GSC 42v 30ah battery, dual motor front and rear diagonal drive. Here are a few pictures of it. It is heavy, made to climb hills in the golf course. Needs that big honking battery. LOL
Will add a video once it gets done loading.
If you have questions about it, feel free??
I am converting it to a Gold Prospecting buggy, to go metal detecting and looking for gold.
May convert it to true 4 wheel drive too!
I need to go everywhere, but not worried about how fast. 4 speeds, 3,6,9 @ 12 mph, but will do 2 rounds of golf on.a charge. Lots of hills, will try.distance on road soon. It Has a usb port too!
Sure the vesc could be turned up, with experimentation and programming help.

Thanks for the add, hope I can repay the help too!![20180218_222810|690x388](upload://xsa0Uk7erDBjVQoPBcxSe9wrtMk.jpg)![20180218_223431|690x388](upload://kfkPsXW45jcRbaA7RAjn40vUNHI.jpg)![20180218_223447|690x388](upload://vDYutotCvgOL5wuvlsvUqDPZB4J.jpg)![20180218_222828|690x388](upload://xHMcoW8HOO9tzoBBj2iY3GnI9Au.jpg)![20180218_222759|690x388](upload://wJLzxjmzJetx335cv5fB81dIsld.jpg)![20180218_222856|690x388](upload://iC4C4Amofsew60gJYxnOHFSpWJO.jpg)
