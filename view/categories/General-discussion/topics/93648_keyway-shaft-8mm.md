I have a couple of 6374 192kv motors 8mm shaft.and I want a keyway on them.
What would be the easiest solution? Buy 2 new shafts from who?![15577287278103664814418304139712|375x500](upload://iWM70yIdniQ5NKsZ8dIN93ljiYX.jpeg)

shafts you can buy here

but if the original dont have a keyway this will not have a key way as well. maybe just flat spot and scrub screw?

This is what I did. Two years later my motors are still going strong with the same pulleys.
