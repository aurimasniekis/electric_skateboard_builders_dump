They are not terrible, but not as good as name brand.  Value for the price they are a steal considering how many sets of these you can get for the price of abec11, but if you want to ride the best then don't get these.  I have nothing against them.  Beware that the abec11 pulley inserts will NOT fit these (the spokes are too fat), but clone pulleys can be printed by some folks around here
