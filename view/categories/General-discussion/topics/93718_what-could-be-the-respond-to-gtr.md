As many riders from here put the finger on it, evolve with the flexible battery and deck as well as new modular battery to help us to tunnel air plane restrictions has introduce many real improvements.
How serious  vendors as Bioboards are going to respond to this gap of technology?
Do you think they are going to introduce more flexible boards with similar feature and patents?
I will appreciate to be at the crossroad of evolve and Bioboards, some flexible deck and enclosures, 12S4P to 12S6P power modules, board upgradable to x4 with 110mm Street conf. 2real focbox that are open source.
Bamboo deck...

Evolve did not have a huge leap infact they just did what peope have been doing to their own evolves for years now.

I will argue that evolve is actually years behind the diy game and has a long way to catch up to bioboards.

Flex is great on a cruiser like an evolve cause its ment for carving but if you want to go fast safely you need a stiff deck like bio boards is using.

Fan-boy much?


We DIY around these parts and build boards that absolutely murder evolve boards.  Even with their minor improvements that bring it into tech over 2 years old...

Sweet, 10s4p? Sweet.  Mind blowing. Jaw dropping.

What oh what will everyone do?  Not shit, because it isn't actual competition for somone like Bioboards. They are catering to a different market.  



Go chill on reddit or face book for shit like this.


Edit: had Jury duty this morning so I am feeling a little spicey.

I am sick and tired of hearing about flexible decks as an advantage. Maybe they are if you are carving at 20km/h.

I like my decks as stiff as they can be, like @brenternet 's manhood.

It's a nice looking copy of the LaCroix styling.

The rest is a gigantic yawn. 

Also, BT remote?  Like that's a positive thing.  I would have thought they would move forward but nope.  

It's pretty sad actually.  Incremental 'improvements' that aren't even close to the standard around here.

The unified PCB idea is neat, but @Blasto been-there-done-that.

They've made leaps here, no doubt about it. Forging, wheels, 18650's and best of all their supply chain is solid AF.

It's still only half as good as the board I built in my kitchen with two kids hanging off my legs on a similar budget. The idea that you would compare this POS to my precision board is insulting at the very least.

You are so caught up in the Evolve marketing hype train its embarrassing.

Fair enough but it's easier to producing 1 or 2 really high quality boards (like the many examples on this forum) compared to producing literally 1000s, while maintaining the same consistently high quality. Elon Musk said that when ramping up Tesla production. Manufacturing at scale is really hard.

There's no way any of their previous boards when through such a rigorous QA and stress-testing process. 120h on that vibration machine is insane and would kill 99% of DIY boards, including both of mine.

Looks like they might have actually learnt from their mistakes.

All I have to add about evolve being shitty is, that's not the experience I've had with them. Bamboo gtx was my first board, I added some straps to it and it kicked ass. The range was only 10-12miles with how i ride on at's, but it was a kick ass first board. I abused the shit out of it jumping off 4steps and such. It did have an issue when i first bought it, sometimes one motor wouldn't spin durring hard acceleration making it feel like the board was trying to apply breaks with one motor (it was just drag). They fixed and returned it same day. Never happened again. Later I threw in a 10s4p and its still kicking ass now. Im prepping it to be my wife's board. Do I live my diy's more than evolve? Hands down, but the gtx was and still is a good board for me.

My favorite part is the solution to the voltage sag... the controller just ignores it and shows an estimated remaining capacity. So the board still has massive voltage sag but the display wont show it. :joy:

The vibration machine was cute, nothing like what a boards will see in actual use. Looked like a really gentle ossilation compared to the bone rattling vibration a board actually sees on a rough road.

Oh look, they coat their pcb's now, maybe they will start cleaning them in an ultrasonic bath on the next iteration and claim another first in eskate. :rofl:

Still seems like a big improvement over their last board but it wont win any races with a little 10s4p battery. Pre-builts are always going to be a tough sell with the builders.

Hi all,
It is fully forbidden to hunt trolls during reproduction period... as @McErono has noticed it, I am a virtual novice, as my prime board should be from a vendor that ships  only on Feb 29th, so  I am a novice without a board (yet).

Now or you accept it and give to me some assistance to upgrade my skills and become an esk8 rider or you let me on the side of the road.
Just few words, I am an 50+ transition manager, practicing big wave kitesurfing for 20 years, apnea for 40 years and a lot of outdoors activities.
E-sk8 will be a way to continue balance trainings as I live 3h far away from the ocean, and reduce CO2 fingerprint letting my car into its place.

I was supposed to train during Mai in Switzerland, but the pseudo manufacturer has decided that 6 months was a too short delay to produce and deliver a prebuild.
It was just enough to take my money and to kill my days off for 2019!

Ok, so let go, I am not doing troll, I just want to get skills, to draw the specifications of my future board, and get it. I know one think: I won't build from scratch, I will probably screw, plug, but nothing else as you know now I am a novice. My future board will be a prebuild one from professional DIY or serious manufacturer.
Board has to be clean inside (no plate of spaghetti), smooth shape, high tech, upgradable, with simple decoration, skulls are not my cup of coffee

Welcome... this forum can chew you up and spit you out if you make claims or suggestions that are unpopular or incorrect. My advice is to not take the negative comments to seriously while taking in all the useful information people give here daily. This is NOT the place to hype up a prebuilt manufacturer like evolve or boosted. Most people here have passed these companies up in specs and technology. Bioboards. Psychotiller and long haired boy are just 3 better choices when it comes to a quality top of the line board.  My biggest piece of advice is to read what all these people (who are much smarter than me) have to say. Hopefully you get your board and ride soon... there is nothing like it.

I have said it before.
Evolve are more than decent boards as soon as you upgrade the battery.
I have a few friends with evolves (now all of them with upgraded batteries, one with a 10s8p).

In Europe, you simply can't buy a better pre-built board for the money. Sure you can get a pre-made DIY  from various vendors but don't think for a minute they are guaranteed to not come with their own problems.

Their last iteration is far from perfect but it is an improvement nonetheless.

This is how smartphones etc. manage voltage sag when reporting battery percentage. It's referred to [Coulomb Counting](https://www.orionbms.com/manuals/utility/acc_coulomb.html) and is the correct way of reporting battery state-of-charge. Measuring voltage in realtime, like most of us DIYers do, is really inaccurate.

Installing a bigger pack isn't really a solution because there will still be some sag, leading the reported percentage moving up and down based on the load applied.

Hey everybody, a total newbie here. Been looking for a thread to make my first post...

I've been skating/longboarding pretty much all my life, I've had a Backfire G2T for about 1,5 months now and I'm hooked and been looking for an upgrade.

I thought the GTR sounded promising, the only downside being the batteries not being 30Q, if it would be in the same priceclass. These comments discouraged me though as it seems a custom build would be a better option. 

Good thing I joined this forum, love to watch all of your beautiful builds!

Cheers from Sweden!

Well not really, I'm pretty happy with it. Smooth carving and I've reached 45 km/h with it, wich is pretty sick for budget board as far as I'm aware.

However, It only got a 10s2p battery and its hubmotors. It was a great intro into the game but I don't like the idea of having the motors in the wheels, taking a good hit every bumb and twig, doesn't feel ideal in the long run.. I've heard the torque is way more powerful on a belt driven board, and I would also like a board where I can have the AT option since there's a lot of cobblestones in my town.

Edit: Also, since I'm the only one of my friends skating, at all. This would be a good way to get some more friends into Esk8ing! (I realize that's mainly an excuse I tell myself to justify another purchase)

Measuring state of charge has nothing to do with what we call "voltage sag."

Here is a quick explanation for you:

Let say we have a board with a 10s4p battery made with 5 amp commodity cells. It will only be capable of 20 amps, 5amps times 4 cells in parrallel. If we try to pull 20 amps or more from this pack the voltage will quickly fall or "sag". This drop in voltage under load effects the overall power curve making it feel sluggish and weak. 

Now lets build another 10s4p battery with high performing 20 amp cells! This will give us 4 times more current, 80 amps. The voltage will be much more stable when on the throttle. The voltage will still drop when goosing the throttle but not nearly as much as it would with cheap commodity cells.

Adding more cells has a huge effect on voltage sag too. I have a board with 144 cells on a 12s12p format and the voltage sag is a non issue.

A bigger problem with all of this is the strawman argument you and eveolve have given here. I have never heard of anyone crying about measuring state of charge under throttle being a huge problem. It has always been the crappy acceleration and low speed from the cheap cells they used. Not sure what your motive is but jumping on this bandwagon and pretending battery size has nothing to do with voltage sag is not good for the knowledge base here.
```

## \#52 Posted by: Bataleon Posted at: 2019-05-14T14:16:29.593Z Reads: 117

```
Realistically, what size pack do you suggest they use then? 50km real-world on urethane/30km with AT is more than adequate. 432Wh is a lot of energy.

The real problem is that 18650 cells have a high energy density but low power density (relative to lipos), so you have to tote around a massive 6.5kg 12s12p battery pack if you want zero voltage sag. This is unrealistic.

Also, since when are Samsung 30Q cells "cheap cells"? AFAIK they are currently the #1 choice of DIYers.
```

## \#53 Posted by: chaka Posted at: 2019-05-14T14:23:36.240Z Reads: 114

```
12s12p and it is geared to do over 60mph. It is not for the faint of heart.

I never said anything about what cells were used I was mearly trying to educate you on what voltage sag actually is. But yes a 10s4p pack with 20 amp cells is weak AF. Even a 10s6p pack with these cells leaves me wanting more.

In the end we should probably stop comparing prebuilts to custom builds. It is like comparing a Prius to club racer. One has a lot of bells, whistles and purchasable virtue, the other is purpose built to be user servicable and improved apon for range and performance. Air hogs are another great example of what the electric skateboard market is. Almost all serious rc fanatics build their own planes from scratch or kit builds but a lot of people are happy to fly an airhog, call it good, and move on. Being the airhogs of the electric skateboard industry is not a bad thing.

On my 12s7p gear drive 10:24.  I gun it a lot. Sure, I could get 20/25 wh/mi riding like @b264 ðŸ˜‚.

But I get like 30-35 wh/mi riding hard. So I get like 26-30 miles.

Why is this on gear drive that I have such realatively low efficiency? Because I have it geared to go fast so it takes a lot more amps to get the same torque at lower speeds.  

If I had it geared to go 28mph, efficiency would climb as my top end drops.  Not worth it to me. I like the torque, but not at the expensive of having a sub 35mph build.

All hating aside, since they seem so serious. Do they have FCC, CE (EMC) and bluetooth certification? If they do, thats the only thing they got going imo, rest of the world sell illegal boards. (maybe boosted certifies thier hardware, not sure)

Yes but look at the price point. I considered one until I realised the prices were in USD.
