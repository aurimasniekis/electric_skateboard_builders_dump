```

I bought a Bajaboard in a used condition of 250km. Those 250km are real and It was driven in a time of just 2 months. Of course there is a chance of having bought a board which was not in good hands, but the preowner made a good impression on me. So no reason to think about that too much.

![image|374x500](upload://jAjwTJ1s6p3cEBkE4M4KDGU8u5U.jpeg) 


So the bad thing about the bajaboard is that everytime I rode, something got broken.



**Some examples of failures/bad engineering and the solution:**

- motor mount screws get loose and block the motor pulley -&gt; they need to be screwed-in with a threadlocker/glue

![image|375x500](upload://dXsZw2wNcabttC5yaAZnRVPMIcC.jpeg)  

- belts dont last long because of stones getting between belt and motorpulley -&gt; here has to be a cover protecting from dirt, stones etc.

![image|375x500](upload://qe5T4jSmOew73rQhjKnIRKUkYTW.jpeg) 


- wishbones make loud noise, because they are worn out after a short time (200km) -&gt; using higher quality wishbones like IGUS GFM-0810-07

![image|374x500](upload://72CWyzE9Ai5yoPpeoBFPdnW2CGT.jpeg) 

- outer side driveshaft bolt got broken-&gt; using stronger ones

![image|375x500](upload://2yUfOrSbZLHOi6FQZWCqVDEmVO6.jpeg) ![image|375x500](upload://iyK1fDXzaK8w9zvggarCtkOvFfp.jpeg) 

- inner side driveshaft bolts worn out-> using stronger ones

![image|375x500](upload://qkvQY5nFvRPhj2JSKzu7Jza5fp9.jpeg) 

- lock ring on one motor did not hold and let the rotor move in and out -&gt; correct mounting

![image|375x500](upload://gIYS0dqFeVx5Qw4Yjo9NaNlVxlq.jpeg) ![image|375x500](upload://tdqS2sPyR0xeWlK0ajLqRfCOnhd.jpeg) 

- battery, bms and cables under battery loose inside of board, terrible cable management-&gt; improving cable mangement and building a covered mount for bms

![image|666x500](upload://8geHDYGY2gW8KqUAkIVDnaDQPbh.jpeg) 
![image|666x500](upload://cYW904JIuzQUDbbh5kUEyQBqtQA.jpeg) 
![image|375x500](upload://zw4jDGu0kkkuSJ8A81bpUcfRLAM.jpeg) 



- old version of drive shaft constant velocity joint rubber boots fall of from driveshaft joint because of no possibility to fix them in position (the three small ones in the following picture) -&gt; new version now has a possibility to use a zip tie

![image|690x399](upload://g2yGDV9e6naiynkdTH2riqkjTzo.jpeg) 


- belts make loud sounds-&gt; changing materials

-  one controller did not work-&gt; got a new one from bajaboard because of warranty, but the new one had a loosen Pin in one of the connectors-> quality control improvements

- ball joints are worn out too quick -&gt; using higher quality

- screws of ball joints under journals got loose, because of bad (white) glue put on them -&gt; using higher quality thread locker

- too much play between plastic wheel and 5 edge mount-&gt; higher material quality and production tolerances

**Here is a video of the worn out parts:** 

https://youtu.be/w3cCeMfgyfI


**Other impressions:**

- controllerdisplay not bright enough -&gt; using brighter LEDs for display

- real range of the board when driving mixed is 20km, not 30km. When reaching 35% battery status, no more high power available

- breaking when roling down a mountain, when board was standing still for some seconds before, sometimes does not work, thats very dangerous! 

- lights don´t light you the way, they are just for beeing seen by others

- acceleration the first meters is boring, just after reaching some speed, acceleration is fun

- hand controller is great itself, except from the display

- going uphill never made problems

- when board is adjusted to a small turining radius and soft dampers-&gt; dont drive over 40km/h because of being uncontrollable by wobbeling


For normal driving the electrical differential and drift mode are the only modes that make useful sense for experienced drivers.

All the other functions like power limit, brake strength, launch control, traction control are just for beginners. I dont see any useful reason of using burnout mode. 


All in all price and quality of that board don´t fit together. 4500€ is way too much for the bad quality you pay for.
If you are about to use the bajaboard in offroad terrain, you will be wasting lots of time in maintenence like repairing and putting money in spare parts.
On road use makes more sense for this board, but thats relatively boring.
To my mind the bajaboard GX4 2017 still is a beta tester board. For example, if you take a look at generation 3 you see better quality in suspension arms (cnc machined).
On the 2018 model front motors got smaler etc. etc.

Looks like you bought what we call in the UK a 'Friday' build :)  

Still, that's pretty shocking for such an expensive board and enough to make me think twice!

I have had a board on order since march and paid a deposit with no contact now for 4 months.  They have gone extremely quiet and I'm thinking issues.  They have also changed the cnc parts for cast and this is a big no no for anyone who has ever had cast parts on an rc.  All the bulkheads are now cast alloy and they will break.  
Theres one other thing that makes it a no go for me though and its the fact that the company seems to have been bought by evolve.  If you go on the website the evolve logo is on the foot.  All I can see happening now is cheapo parts and bad customer service.

it's true, and I understand in China they're still hand-fitting the transmission parts together (meaning a replacement part might still need fine tuning)

not the end of the world, yet the last thing I need is another Leiftech ;)

Up until 4 months ago I was getting weekly progress reports and videos from the production plant in china and everything looked legit.  Now all is quiet and no replies from mails.  I've kind of given up on it to be honest and just going to take the loss.  No biggie really as I've changed my mind on it anyway.  The board is far too complex and heavy.  Rather spend the money on a decent mtb build.

yeah i had a go on one a few weeks ago. as cool as they are, they just have far too many points of failure. Also, for a "mountain board", once you stand on the board, 100mm of clearance really isn't enough. Yeah they drive really well but like i said and like this post confirms, there's just too many points of failure

Building a board like a reduced scaled car is a planned failure : micro mechanic is good for watches not for boards!

seem the build quality has gotten worse, my first batch GX3 has none of those issues, I must have done 5k miles on it, I do follow the manual on maintenance - was the board 'loved' or abused before you got it? I do wonder if the original owner actually looked after this board at all. 

I've not had any problems with the drive train at all, never needed to adjust the motors (other than to remove to fit belt - serious pain IMO) 

i have to say the quality from g3 to g4 seems really bad... I would be very hesitant to buy a g5 model based on what I've seen here, thanks for the write up I think you saved me some future disappointment - I've tried to wreck my g3 since i was trying to justify an upgraded version (before I got into DIY)  sounds like I could destroy a g4 in a couple of weeks :(

Crazy to hear that your board made that much miles without those issues.
The board was used, offroad and onroad. This board is called by bajaboard "off-road beast". So it has to last longer than 8 rides without beeing fully worn out...

In your case I would just change the electronics like battery and esc´s on your gx3 and you will have the best offroadmonsterboard.

I'm tempted to mod the motor mounts to see if I can fit something bigger, I would love to fit 4x 80100's - already have 4xFoxBoxes for my baja mod :)

Hi Srapy,

This is Alessandro from BajaBoard. 
First I would like to thank you for your detailed review and everyone else for their comments from the BajaBoard team.
We absolutely take these criticisms constructively, and in fact, between your 2017 model and the latest version, we have changed quite a few things.
 
Many of these we haven't mentioned in the public arena, because they aren't as notable as range or speed improvements, but I'll list a few below as this is probably the most appropriate forum.
 
![20190111_101046|421x500](upload://m90Jy9ChLOsrFgWcgWSUQHDYSwe.jpeg)

1. Our motor in 2017 had custom built-on motor plates. New motors are now more standard, and mount onto a separate motor plate with 4 x threadlocked screws. The 6 little screws can't impinge on the pulley anymore, also suitable for mounting a standard 63mm motor, this motor plate also reduce the risk of the motor shaft circle clip (lock ring as you called) to come loose too.

![20190111_103911|450x500](upload://8vejMy2QIbvyZROTF6xJVzF6ERK.jpeg)

2. We have been trialing the different kinds of bushings for the wishbones. This is one of the ones we've been trialing, which looks pretty close to your suggestion.

3. We have already changed the pin of the outer driveshaft with one that has a slot in the middle so the grub screws can go inside the slot and hold better the pin to come loose.

4. Battery and BMS have been changed with a more performance and long lasting pack. Battery you have would've been an 8S Li-NMC pouch cell set up.  Our latest is now using Samsung 30Q, in 10S config. Right now we are also field testing with the Sanyo 20700B, which is getting good range for the 2WD version.

![Loom|690x316](upload://9JfAsiJ8TGIlzimr028ianAm8Fe.jpeg)

5. Cable management did leave much to be desired in 2017.  In the latest model, everything is a lot tidier inside with mounting brackets to the side.  We also did find that in the 2017 boards, some of the connectors could come loose because of the cable layout.  Happy to say that's all been addressed now.

![20190111_101527|583x500](upload://A2ovICzFA7rDeVlakzoE8nZwIqB.jpeg)

6. The outdrive has now a slot where we can add a zip tie or retaining ring to keep the boots in place.

![20190111_101233|690x454](upload://2pHJnpyc2zLuJCYNdEC6aSoMU43.jpeg)

7. We changed belt suppliers to a better brand.  Also going to be switching over to Kevlar reinforced belts in 2019.  Also working on an underside bash plate, so the belts won't be fully enclosed, but they will soon be a lot more protected.

8. We have revamped our choice about all the joints and bearings, increasing cost on our end, and for an example, all the ball joints are made in Japan.

9. Range depends a lot on different factors such as terrain, temperature, weight, riding style, alignment of the wheels, pressure of the tires so it's hard to comment on your range but as first tip here is to make sure the tires are pump at 45psi. About the range of our latest boards, in addition to the change in battery, if everything is set up as it should now we can actually achieve 30km+ in real life with the G4X, and 40km+ with the G4.

![20190111_101452|623x499](upload://gQ5rlvUVq8dWJlCM4ZdggnzrHE2.jpeg)

10. We are experimenting with different headlight to improve visibility at night. Last year's light was indeed too spread. Also the lights are now enclosed inside protective casing, insteading of being fully exposed.

11. Changing the battery pack we have also improved a lot the acceleration of the board from a start thanks to a more power battery pack but also increasing the gear ratio. I will link some video of my instagram account so you can see how it accelerate
http://www.pictame.com/media/1909436588875887209_4794577153#media-1
http://www.pictame.com/media/1876994713426792342_4794577153

I would like to add some improvements that we also made that you haven't pointed out.

1. The old paint job used to chip off quite easily, changed the finish, now more resistant to scratches. And for parts that are in the spray path of the tires, like the rear wishbones, we are looking at other methods of surface overlay protection. 
2. All the steel parts have been galvanized apart the drive shaft which is going to be protected in this year production
3. Improve gasket for water ingress (still not fully waterproof, but a lot better than 2017).

This isn't a sales pitch just to be sure.  Just wanted to acknowledge the criticisms.  If you guys have any other suggestions, or questions, please leave them here or just email us.

Cheers.

After a long time with no communication I am glad to announce contact has been restored and they have offered me a full deposit refund due to the time involved.  This is great customer service and has restored my faith in the company.  Great to see them coming in here to address issues in production.  Seriously a great bunch of guys which is why i was initially surprised with the lack of communication.
Welcome @BajaAle and thankyou for the refund.

Hi everyone,

I am new to this site.
I have been researching the Bajaboard since it first came out.
I am happy to announce that I bought a 2nd hand 2018 GX4 with 17miles on it.  unfortunately the previous owner took a bad spill & the front left wheel has a lot of play on it... need to repair that before attempting speeds above 32mph.
Thanks for the great review.
I look forward to putting up my posts.

Srapy,  Thanks for this great review... especially on the worn out ball joint.  I have the same issue. was is difficult to tap out the pin?  I currently don't have video capability to show what is going on with my board, but I have the same "slop" in the ball joint as in your video,..  any tip form you will be welcomed.  Thank you... BTW I am in San Jose, CA.... I am having a hard time finding fellow Eskate riders.

If you have the right tools its easy, if not, its harder. There are kind of pin pusher tools you have to use just with a hammer. You get those parts you need directly all from bajaboard.

Hi Srapy,
it looks like the CV 6001Z bearings have gone bad. One has a lot of "slop" the other corners are in fair condition, but will need replacing in the future.
Did you get some replacement bearings from Baja or did you look for upgrades?
I just wrote Baja, I hope the bearings are under warranty.

The bearings seem to be pressed fit. any pointers on getting them out?
Thanks

If you get them for free, take them, if not, buy them from manufacturers like SFK, FAG, etc. You have to use a bigger pin puncher. Just hammer against the bearing from the inside at an small angle. They should come out easily.

Hi Srapy,

I decided to upgrade the bearings to OMNI Race TiN Titanium Ceramic bearings.
Thanks for the tip on taping out the bearings, ill give that a try when I get home.

did you use any specific grease for the CVboot?  
I have lithium grease from my other skateboards, would you use that for the CV?

Sorry no pics on my board, but when I can, I will put up.

Take a look at their website, there you will finde the grease they are using. Check the specification of the grease and you will find something similar to it. Normally any multi purpose grease should do it!

Hi srapy,

maybe you can help me....
As I previously mentioned,  I have a GX4 2018.08 Bajaboard. I got it 2nd hand with 17miles on it. Unfortunately about 2 weeks ago I decided to tinker with it and take a look under the “hood” so to speak. I had just finished cleaning out the battery compartment and was putting the 900Wh 30Q battery pack back when it happened… I did not pay to much attention to this little white & frayed wire coming out from the pack… I should have known better (I am an Aerospace Engineer so I am a perfectionist with OCD). so as I was putting the batter back into the bay, the little white wire touched the “contactor”.

so now I am not 100% sure if my battery pack is still any good or where the this little white wire is to be attached to, but it seems like it is a loop that was not suppose to be out side the battery pack… Nor do I know if the mother board is working properly since it seems to keep vibrating on me when I power it on.

So at this point I am giving up and looking to upgrade the mother board to the 2019 MB w/ Tank mode. buying the 1.1KWh battery pack, I am also looking to get the 110A controllers, the 16T pulley. I am not sure if I want to go with their motors just yet. does anyone here have any suggestions on motor upgrades? I want to stay with 6374, but I am not sure which motor would be an upgrade to what Baja is offering since they have not revealed the specs to their motor. I have asked, but they are staying silent…

my playground is sunny silicon valley CA where the weather is always nice. and I am looking for more top speed. I use my board to commute to work and everywhere in Santa Clara county.

YES I am used to speeds in the high 30mps to low 40mph. I first started speeding with a VISA Dirtsurfer about 15years ago when only gas was available.

All suggestions on upgrading the motors would be welcomed.

Thanks

Hi, 
well in your case to repair the battery i would inform myself more about batteries especially BMS. Its not rocket science :grin:  You can get a new BMS and your problem is solved. 
I dont understand "keep on vibrating on me". 
If you want to make a monster out of it use a vesc 6/6 plus and keep the motors, they are fine! You just should take care if the 1.1kwh battery pack can deliver enough amps to all 4 motors at the same time. 
Maybe some LiPos are the better option with a good charger like Junsi 4010 but then it will be less practical/comfortable without an BMS. The hole rebuild wont be cheap!

Hi Srapy,

Thanks for your input... maybe Baja will send me the schematics on the BMS once I spend some money with them.. I have only cycled the batteries 4-5 times myself.

Let me elaborate what I mean by “keep on vibrating on me”....  when I turn on the hand controller the controller is silent..... it is when I power on the board and the board tries to communicate with the controller .... the controller doesn't stop vibrating.. the low bat signal keeps flashing then the big blue lightning symbol flashes then back to the low battery... also the TCS pops up... its like the controller is possessed....  so I am guessing I fried the mother board...  

Any further thoughts?   Thanks Srapy   (yes I am capitalizing your 1st letter out of respect)

Some pictures of the damaged cables etc. would help us to help you. Now I understand, you mean the hand controller is vibrating. I thought the mainboard where all controllers and the battery is connected to is vibrating, thats why I was wondered. There must be something wrong with the bms, but we will see on your pictures. Controller normally vibrates if you go to a set limit like 20% battery charge. You will find it in the controller menu. What % does the controller show? Youre Welcome!
