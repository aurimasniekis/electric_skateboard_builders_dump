It's 2016.  You know.  Sometimes especially when I'm out on a nice day and meeting friends and drinking a beer. We are all happy. Respect to those that don't have our good fortune.  I'm having a good time riding.  I'm in the outdoors.  In the outdoors. I'm enjoy riding and hope everyone can

With catholic guilt they say.   Want to calibrate the enjoyment level.  Relate it  to what  could be .  Throught history.   Or present.   There's Always the strive to better oneself.  I'd like to feel I'm there.  I don't want anything, sounds hookey, but to finish charging :grinning:

If there is one thing I can pass on, make a cover story as to why you don't drink.

Well I am sane enough to do it.

The Globe Maiden Deck: Because the deck is light, its black, for down hill, shaped like an arrow and the bolt at the rear side can be placed at the very edge (no kick tail) allow me to drag the board like a suitcase without scratching the deck.

2 VESC: You know why!

Dual weather sealed HUB motor: The Netherlands is rainy 80% of the time, I am not a huge fan of cleaning this after every ride.

High impact flame resistant ABS Enclosure ip65: Doesnt get scratch easily, take care of my lipo protection, water sealed.

80A Gold Plated Fuse: General protection against over current and or reverse polarity. Having a large fuse will provide higher efficient in batteries as fuse known to get hot before cutting off (burn batteries life faster)

Anti Spark Switch System: I just created double switch 1 DPDT and 1 momentary switch with resistor to charge up the capacitors while maximizing my toggle switch life. For safety while using lipo, I like physical switch more over soft switch. Soft switch seems to be prone to breaking (maybe not but just to be very sure about the lipo).

Huge Industrial Grade Capacitors: Provide higher and faster discharge energy to the motor especially great for the start up torque. Somehow I also feel more efficient having big caps (less battery stress during high discharge).

Lipo Packs: Cheap, easy to work with, ridiculous discharge amps, boxy shape easy fitting, light. Less life cycle! Who cares? I think they last for about one till two years. Meanwhile new batteries are developing, by then I'd buy better batteries.

my decks because i make them

R-SPECS because i just like them and they like me. Not to mention keyways and circlips and easy installs because of it. And they're just awesome. 

VESCs because i like to configure things specifically for my flavor. 

crushed coke bottle grip because nothing is more metal than covering your deck with broken glass

satellite drive systems because i like the torque/top end ratio i've been getting so far and it is configurable and updatable. downside is more components to fail and lose, but its worth it in my opinion. At least for now. 

minwax stain because it really takes well to that hard rock maple. 

hard rock maple ply because they don't yet have death metal maple ply, or black metal maple ply. Trip hop maple ply may be nice to have as well. 

superworm silicone high strand wire because its flexible like wet spaghetti and can take abuse.  It makes things so much easier to work with. 

bullet connectors in situations where i don't directly solder because they are basically the perfect butt-style connector for single wires. 

bones reds bearing because they are basically the perfect price/performance ratio and can be cleaned easily.  

caliber ii trucks because motor mounts and the aluminum covered solid axle design allows for easy modification, and the price performance ratio is about damned perfect. 

flywheel clones because injection molded pulleys work well with them and they come in most of the primary colors for tuning aesthetics. Not to mention they last a long while, have a softer, smoother ride than genuine flywheels, and appear to be able to take staples and nails without chunking right away. 

beer because its beer.

This thread is the best ever.

My own freshly pressed decks, because who has money for overpriced wood/carbon.

Dual motors. Because symmetry.

More specifically, rewound and bearing'd NTM Prop Drives because they're cheap, when they're available. Maytech 6355s when they're not, because they're also cheap.

Turnigy LiPos, because they're cheap. 18650 Li-Ion packs because that shit seems to be the steez at the moment.

VESCs, because they're VESCs.

Arduino Pro Mini + cheap eBay nunchucks because this is the cheapest and easiest controller solution. and if you don't like the dropouts, mod the shit out of that code.

Silicone coated wire. Just because.

Custom designed motor mounts laser cut from alu/SS by whoever does that metal laser cutting thing. Because they are dirt cheap and take 2 days to make and you can mount whatever you want to whatever you want.

Custom designed wheel pulleys and wheel spacers laser cut from alu as above for however many teeth you want and dirt cheapness.

Flywheel clones because Flywheel clones, and colour things, as previously mentioned.

Belts from RS components because of free same day delivery. And Contitech.

Chargers made from BMSes and external power supplies. Because why do you want a current limited BMS on your board when the VESC does that.

Carling Black Label, a freshly rolled Golden Virginia cigarette, complemented by a (trigger warning) steez stick of green, because, Zamalek. Mos.

Huge Industrial Grade Capacitors

Are you talking about capacitors on your VESC board?

No. I had extra capacitor. 10.000 uf, which is huge. Making huge spark when you plugged in without anti spark system. I think its bigger capacity than 2 VESC capacitors I have (6 caps of VESC in dual drive still smaller than this).

I chose the bustin sportster pro for its cradling shape.  And I chose it again.  And it's stiff.  Yet thin. 

Vescs because every board I had with rc escs was annoying and loud 

Hub motors because every board I made with pulleys was loud and overly complicated and had a lot of resistance

And choosing to pot everything because of a million reasons biggest being my wires are always breaking and sending the board off on its own.
I chose Velcro because it's easy and looks cool and until I find out something the hard way I have to try

Yes especially when you're not at full speed / throttle, it provide you with a the torque kick. My caps can provide an additional 2 - 3 Amps spike within that 1 - 2 seconds. So less stress on battery discharge as the caps take care 2 - 3 Amps from the peak discharge of the battery. For several reason that extra torque kick provide longer journey for me (extend travel distance).

This is pretty awesome to know. Before I'd been trying to get less capacitors and now I want more.
