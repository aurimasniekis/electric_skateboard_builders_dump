ALSO, you can share a special discount code with your friends so they save $15 off the normal VESC-X price too. **WIN-WIN**

We are not paying for content creation at this stage, however as a affiliate looking to promote products and earn cash it is a very good idea to create a user freindly page, with quality content that helps explain/showcase the products that you are promoting. This will lead to more referals  converting to sales.

What does the case do?  How well do you think it would do duct taped to a stiff deck?  Maybe fill the case with rubber.   Looks like a good mold.

The heat sink looks great.

Hello to all the affiliates that have registered so far, can you please help me check out that the system is tracking your links properly. I just had to make some changes with the analytics codes & I have already done a test order to ensure the purchases are being tracked correctly, which they are!

Now just want to make everyone's social share shortcuts are also working properly.

Specifically, i want to see if the twitter account & facebook sharing is working properly as I have used a custom URL

Please go to your [Dashboard](https://enertionboards.leaddyno.com/affiliate) & share some stuff.

thanks

When the VESC-X can do 100Amp Continuous Current, I'll order one.

What say you to a 5Kw motor for a go cart. The VESC has great potential. Vedders work was easy to expand and modify. VESC X is an improvement, but I was hoping for an improvement in terms of motor support.

Ya feel me?

Maybe an ESC for a motor bike might be a better choice?

100A continuous is a heap of power

@onloop I tried inputting the code WIN-WIN on a vesc-x order to test it out but it says that it can't be applied to the order. I don't want to spread the word until I know how to give people a discount.

I have templates already saved into the affiliate system that have the codes written, each time you share your link the discount code is also there.

can you access the affiliate dashboard?

Are you actually being serious? I can't tell.... 

You are going to need something a lot more robust in that case. 

The VESC and the VESC X are both amazing for their intended uses...
