Is there anyone in the EU who has a laser cutter and is willing to cut some grip tape for me?

Happy to pay in cash or parts for your time and effort :)

I have been most successful with 60 tuned down, had some issues with 45 tuned up.

You can maybe try a local makerspace?

I am looking into that @Bor.inc but it's going to be close to £300 by the time I buy the membership, do the training and hire the machine....

I am wondering if its cheaper in the long run to buy a machine.

I will get some quote from commercial laser cutting places.

I just ordered these to make my hand made hexagons a little cleaner, hopefully.

I reached out to local laser cutters and they were either not interested or way too pricey.

Hey mate, would be happy to support ! I'll be going to a kitesurfing trip the next weeks so I won't have access to my laser cutter but after that, I can help you in no time!
