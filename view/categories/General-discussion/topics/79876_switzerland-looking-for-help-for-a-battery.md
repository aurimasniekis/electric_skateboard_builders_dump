Hello everyone, I have a nice 10S4P sitting on my desk but some nickel stripes are starting to detach from the battery.
I'm looking for someone (or a company) that could help me spot weld again all this, to make the battery usable !
Because of strict customs, looking only in Switzerland or in France right next to the border (Evian or something near Lausanne / Geneva)

See you on the roads !
