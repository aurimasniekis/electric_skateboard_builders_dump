Since I am researching alot within the area of law and regulation for our beloved electric longboard, I believe it's nice and proper to get some useful links and documentation in one spot rather than under my own build. This links is also particularly useful for You who want to try revolutionised our country rules and enforced them to accept / create / make an exception for a portable personal electric vehicle. One other mission of this post is to make clear what are the definition of "Public Road Safety Vehicle". Hopefully we could learn how to make a public road safe vehicle as well as being able to enjoy what we are doing without being afraid of getting a fine / confiscation of our eBoard and the destruction of our eBoard.

---

Some of the links here are in Dutch as I am researching from the Netherlands. For sure some who are able to understand could also help post / send link to complete the library.

---

To begin with I believe this is the holy grail of what is so called EU law of vehicle and vehicle types (long and boring)
However below there are some useful tables that could help us determine what aspect EU are expecting from a safe vehicle.
Note: For this link we can put Electric Longboard into category of Moped L1E - A (Stated by multiple person from RDW)
RDW is an EU - world known vehicle type approval company, their job is to test safety of vehicle.

Maybe some of you ever heard of VIN number:
So here is some info regarding VIN number
http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32009L0139&from=NL

---

Known fact for The Netherlands law within the category of special moped
Link is http://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0035848/geldigheidsdatum_05-02-2016
I am placing here some of the most important parameter, some of the rest might not be applicable / we already have it within our electric longboard.
(I will keep this updated, please inform me if I miss something)
<ul>
<li>Not more than 25km/h on normal road</li>
<li>Not more than 6km/h on walking road</li>
<li>Motor doesn't exceed 4KW</li>
<li>Have lights front & back</li>
<li>The light on the front emits no other than white or yellow</li>
<li>The taillight and brake light rays not unlike red</li>
<li>Must be older than 16 years old</li>
<li>Red and yellow / white reflectors</li>
<li>Have VIN Number (Vehicle Identification Number)</li>
<li>Dimension no more than:  L 2.00m x W 1.10m /li>
---
<li>Efficient braking system whose deceleration is at least 4.0 m / s</li>
<li>Fitted with a working steering or a working operating system</li>
<li>The wheels are equipped with pneumatic tires (We need to equip all terrain wheels)</li>
<li>The special moped is fitted with a working bell or a functioning horn with fixed pitch</li>
</ul>

NEW UPDATE thnx to @jarivd
https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/onderwerpen/bijzondere-voertuigen/vraag-en-antwoord/wat-zijn-de-verkeersregels-voor-skaters

Sadly now its illegal, but it has never been fully legal anyway. So stay safe, cruise in city and open street don't go beast mode till you hit the park!

I think there is no EU-wide legislation for light EV:s (except for pedelecs). Here in Finland the new light EV-law came in to force  on 1. January 2016. Government wants new "innovations" to be born in Finland so they opened the road for all kind of electric vehicles. 

Some specs of the law
Max speed:  **25km/h**
Max power: **1000w**
**CE**-markings
Required: Bell/horn, reflectors and user have to use helmet
No need to register (no VIN) or take an insurance
You can use bike lanes but not drive on sidewalk (same as for bikes)

Or if you want to drive on the sidewalk then the max speed can be only 15km/h

Link to english press release from the Ministry of Transport and Communications

Hope this information helps you. Good luck on your mission @laurnts!

Speaking about the LAW ! 

They do stop you in the Netherlands apparantly if you drive an electric skateboard,

There was a guy on marktplaats.nl or some other Dutch second hand selling site that placed his Boosted Board up for sale, he had lot's of troubles getting it here and when he took it out for a spin, the cops confiscated it.
He got it back however but put it up for sale to avoid legal issues....

Yes at this very moment cops could take it since Boosted also doesn't have VIN number. Thats one of the necessary requirements and I am not sure how expensive and how hard to get it. What I know from a local shop before is that the cops use to confiscate an electric skateboard due to having no brakes. But now I suppose it's alot safer with the technologies, so I really would like to push some mails to the ministry and the RDW for it.

Okay one of the great news just arrived from RDW. They considered electric longboard as a special moped, hence RDW can't do anything to provide any paper / certification to the vehicle. Now it's only the ministry who can decide the legality of the vehicle. I will contact the ministry next week, I have both the phone number as well as the email.

@laurnts great efforts you are putting in this, i hope they'll legalize/accept these boards soon. I see the Yuneec E-go board and some boards called Skatey are being sold in The Netherlands, but with the "only use on private terrain" kind of message.

I think electric longboards are even safer than normal longboards, because electric longboards can actually brake when its needed, i hope the Dutch government shares the same opinion hehe.

Okay I have received new information. I've been sending email to the Dutch Ministry and expecting them to reply, it might take time otherwise I would call them. After calling the RDW again, it appears that the ministry decide if the vehicle is a special moped or not (rather confusing), but anyway according to the description it is. RDW only have certain test for special vehicle category, so special moped is not really one of them. Getting VIN number is relatively cheap about 100 euro, however if it requires certain - long test (depend on ministry I suppose) it could reach up to / begin at 800 euros (not quite sure). Thats it for now.

Hi @laurnts, really good work so far! 
Is there anything I can do to help you and get things moving with the Ministry. I have an electric skateboard that I can make available for testing if that is what the Ministry requires. 
I got fined big time by the police (383 euro) and they almost confiscated my board. As for the costs: I think we can do some crowdfunding here. I know a bunch of folks with an electric skateboard who would probably be happy to chip in. 
Cheers!

Strange when i wae riding my friends Boosted Board in Utrecht and cops pulled me to the side i didn't get a ticket. They said they stopped me because they were wondering what it was ( how i was going so fast ) and they thought it was pretty cool. They even tried it themself. 

They also told me that they can't manage them and aren't really illegal. So they couldn't give me a ticket.

My friend also said that happened to him a couple times, never had a ticket. Just asking what it was and some trying it out aswel.

Guess we got lucky with this ?

Strange thing, I frequently ride in Gouda and even when I bypass police in cars or on bicycles they never take notice. Might be depending where you are in the Netherlands or also riding stealthy might help. Don't know.

So sad for the fine. Well the thing is that Boosted and Ego are fairly easy to notice by police. A custom board with a hub motor is harder to notice. They also very silent so it's easy to be stealthy. By far many cops and police pass by me and I just keep the speed very low.

I agree with crowdfunding for the test and regulation. I promoted it at Rotterdam citylabs010.nl
https://www.citylab010.nl/plannen/lightelectricvehicle

I hope it will be noticed and we could get help from Rotterdam government as well as the ministry.

To be honest I believe I had all of the documents from the Ministry already. BUT the paperwork is thick as hell, in Dutch and it requires RDW test for that. I am not used with the process, that is one heck of a problem.

RDW test cost at minimum 800 euro up to 1500 euro. This applies to one product in particular and NOT similar model of vehicle. VIN number is the things you are looking for from RDW.

OK, so it makes sense to not try to get the DIY esk8s tested etc., but only popular retail models such as the Boosted Board. 
If you have got all the documents, please let me know and I will go over them.

If you get ticket and they take your board, your next build should be built on this deck so you can wave it to the cops

Amsterdam resident here, I'm buying a BB as soon as I can get my hands on one. If anyone has one for sale in the area let me know. I saw a guy riding one yesterday in Oost. I guess if you keep your speeds to a normal level you could get away with looking like a regular longboarder. I get a lot of shit on my regular longboard from cyclist, but they are always in a crap mood in Amsterdam so that won't change I guess.

Any Amsterdam riders out here?

It is not just about not being caught - you need to also be aware of what will happen if you are involved in an accident. Even if it is not your fault you will have problems because you did something illegal. Keep that in mind and ride super careful.

I've just did some conversations with some entrepreneurs on their opinions regarding electric skateboard. Some said that its fine as long as you don't attract so much attention with your build and speed. People start using hoverboard again in city center and they seemed to be fine with it. I also believe that the law is starting to change abit. In Austria for instance, they already allow small electric vehicle to be used in the city. This allowance would be soon applied to most countries. Time will tell.

Entrepreneurs can't do much, only pressure from community can. The more common it is, the more visible the government would notice. Therefore they are the one who will make action and decide the future. As more and more people are needing it, the chances are huge that esk8 in very near future would be commonly seen on street. The invention of Segway already mark the beginning of personal transportation which is publicly allowed. Its just a matter of time.

Will find it out soon, board is almost ready. Time to make Leeuwarden unsafe. Still i get it why cops won't like these. All vehicles here need a license plate, a board would fall under the blue license plate which means 15kmh in busy areas and 25kmh in unbusy (out of the city). You also need insurance for the vehicle. Good thing would be if they could be labelled like Segway's. And skateboards would only require a helmet.

Tbh if you want to debate about allowance of electric longboard, it falls in the category of special moped (similar to segway). It would be the same as ebike with pedal assits (not speed pedelec). There is no legal rules saying that eboard is illegal atm.

Okay this is the update for now, sadly no black on white but Eboard are illegal to drive in The Netherlands.

However you can have them legally on public street through registration and or through an application a procedure with RDW. But don't worry special segway can pass this test, so does this eboards I assume.

I will investigate this further later, I also have design that will allow to use eboard in The Netherlands legally. Just need to wait my company to released its beta product :smiley:

Hi guys,
i wanted to share my experience. So i live in the Netherlands and usually ride Groningen where i study and in Leiden where my parents live, i never had issue with the police on my evolve bamboo gt but i try to be discrete when police cars are around. I got stopped on time in Groningen and they were curious about the board. They asked me if this was legal and i told them the rules weren't really clear yet. They were very nice and let me go without anything. One of the officers actually wanted to buy one. Also i want to say that if one day i would get ticketed for riding an electric skateboard i would never pay it and i would prefer to fight it in court in order to get some light on the subject. Voila have fun with your boards and don't think too much about law enforcement

It's actually never really allowed, without any clear statement, the RDW already stands on limiting the possibilities and likeliness of electric vehicle int he first place. This rule also include hoverboard. However again, it's very hard to distinguish between electric longboard and normal longboard. Same goes to legal and illegal ebike. Nevertheless, lately I only ride my board on the park, is nicer (I have eMTB anyway so on the road is quite hard to manuver).

Dutch politicians need to recognize that electric longboards and similar small electric vehicles can save the country a lot of money on infrastructure, as they are currently investing heavily in fighting traffic congestion and getting people to use public transport. Sure Esk8s can be dangerous to the rider, but with some basic rules in place (like speed limits on public roads and the use of helmets) that can be reduced to an acceptable level. There must also be a distinction between the different genres of electric vehicles, an esk8 can not be compared to a hoverboard.

Another reason to legalize is the fact that an electric longboard uses only 1kWh of electric energy per 100km on average, which is in the order of 15-20 times more energy efficient than a car. So even if you charge it with dirty energy, it still is a huge improvement

Why electric skateboards should be legal in the Netherlands:

- We have the best infrastructure in the world for small electric vehicles, bike lanes! The Netherlands is arguably the safest country to ride esk8s. Its likely that the severe injury rate of esk8s is far lower than that of cars already with no speed limits and rules in place.
- Reduced congestion, improved use of public transport, reduction in government spending on fighting congestion and promoting use of public transport
- Reduced energy use
- Can be fueled 100% from renewable energy sources
- Reduced noise pollution
- Reduced air pollution
- Reduced cost of maintaining roads
- Reduced dependency on oil from foreign countries
- It is the government's duty to provide its citizens with as much freedom as possible and to only intervene if it is absolutely necessary.
- Its the government's duty to spend our tax money wisely and make the right decisions when it comes to improving the quality of our living environments

@Stef Very great input for the next communication if I have the chance to meet a mayor or arguments in RDW. However the "government" doesn't seem to see it that way. Because the ease of manufacturing / creation of electric vehicle, they even try to stop it. It's all about safety, fire, building over powered machines, etc. It's pretty clear that the road is congested and public transport alone can't really fix A - B issue. I'm pretty sure within the coming years, there will be all new regulations of electric power and speed. At some point rules will have to change. In 2020 The Netherlands also will be freed from 25kmh moped and all motorbike will use car road anymore.

Just stumbled on this, and was wondering if anyone have had any problem yet riding eboards here.
Do you guys that ride already here, do you ride on the streets? Bike lanes? 
And I was wondering if it's better to keep it low and just ride it like it is, or add some front/back lights and such.

I fear like hell to have a expensive thing like this confiscated.

Well the rule of thumb is if you ride eboard, make sure you ride on the bike lane and not walking path. Rule 2 is not exceed 25kmh. Rule 3 is not endanger your self and or other people around you. I have been stopped once because I rode on a walking path, but thats all about it.

That's what I thought, but I am expat here, barely new to Amsterdam, it's good to be sure of how things goes here.

And if I can help in anything on your project for eboard and any effort on going forward on the legalisation of it, let me know.

I usually ride in bike lanes or in some bike/people lanes that we have here around Lisbon. I already passed some policemen and none of them said anything, only saw me pass by. Until now I consider Portugal an esk8 friendly country. :)

One day when the government sees that they can tax the esk8 as an electric commuting vehicle we are domed. Here we have taxes for everything that can be transformed as revenue. In that day Portugal won't be so esk8 friendly for sure. :(

Just now got stopped by the police in Amsterdam. For the record I was riding in the bike lane, just ahead of my gf that was on her bike so you can understand how low the speed was. The officer said that it's not legal and that next time he will be giving me a fine. 
I asked ofc why, and he gave me the story about not being a registered vehicle, hence there is no insurance etc. 
I told him about keeping the speed limit, following bike rules bla bla but nothing. 
He said maybe in a couple years it will be different but for now I cannot drive it. Even asked me how I will be going home and I had to explain that I can also push without the motor and to be honest he did not seemed very convinced. However, he was like ok but if I see you again ... 
Any thoughts?

Would check the local laws to see if there is any limit on motorized "toy vehicles" or "electrical mobility assistance devices" in terms of max power or speed and see if you can just adjust things so you stay within those limits (at least in public).  I have no idea about Amsterdam, but in Chicago (Oak Park specifically, but I ride between Chicago and Oak Park) they basically have bigger fish to fry and so long as you aren't posing a threat to people (riding dangerously fast where there are pedestrians or riding on sidewalks) then they don't seem to mind.  I see people riding little motorcycles and hoverboards and all manner of strange personal transportation around here so it seems like it's just generally accepted.  Just had a Peapod (food delivery) guy driving next to me while I was cruising home smiling and asking me questions about the board as we cruised up to an intersection, police were across the intersection as I ran across they didn't say a word to me (usually if they do it's something friendly, only one "negative" encounter so far and was an unmarked police car and the officer was just shaking people down... saw him when I got into town shaking some other guy down too, no ticket for me though or anything just told me to keep it on the streets).

seen to be pushing Reducing Carbon Footprint will look good,every city in the euro zone had to put in bike lanes to be seen to be making an effort to reduce there carbon footprint,2 to3 times a week if its dry i do a 14mile round trip to work and back on my eboard it stops me starting my diesel van even going to the shop  i take the eboard befor i was driving my van,,,,

The issue with eboard is "not really allowed" is all about safety. The rules were created actually to supress people building their own electric vehicle (not ebike / eboard) but more into overpowered electric car and electric motor bikes. Because they are easy to make and since it's custom made, there is no company that can regulate the safety rating of the vehicle.

Just imagine if you can build an eboard, same tech applies into building an ecar. When people start building ecar, the government worried not into the safety of the person who build it him / her self, but other people around them who shares the same road.

Same goes if you build an eboard that goes 100km/h, you might be wearing full armor. But if you collide with kids on a small bike passing without full awareness of traffic, thats where the issue about unregulated evehicle is problematic.

----

Basically more and more LEV is coming on its way. The government still trying to learn more about the impact of electric cars and electric bikes at this moment. Research is on its way, sooner or later things will change. New rules will be implemented and trust me, there will be the day where eboard will share the road legally.

Lately I also didn't use my board that much anymore unless I really have to travel the distance. Speeding is also not my thing as the road is actually very dangerous for eboarders especially without proper equipment.

Be aan obedient citizen is the best way to have your board and not getting them confiscated or destroyed.

I am just about ready writing my plans for a DIY board. My daily commute is about 20 KM, of which about 13 KM is a single straight bike-lane with no normal lanes nearby. I think this would've been an excellent opportunity to ride a board like this, but I'm not sure whether I should go through with this. It's a lot of time and money to invest and it would be really shitty to have it confiscated.

I'm from the Eindhoven-region and will be contacting Jannie Visscher (alderman for the infrastructure) soon to see what her thoughts on the matter are. Should be interesting.

Riding on busy city bycycle lanes/streets is asking for trouble, especially if you are going faster than 25km/h (binnenstad). Outside the crowded areas should be fine. As long as you can clearly see all the other traffic and change your speed accordingly to the situation. Be safe but most of all make sure all the other people around you are safe.

In that case I guess the best behaviour to avoid getting "caught" or hurt yourself + others is to limit your riding to bike-lanes, with a maximum speed of 25 km/h when in the city. If you're in a smaller town with less busy streets and law-enforcement, you could probably up your speed a bit. This is pure speculation though as I have yet to ride an electric skateboard.

What speeds do you guys consider to feel "fast" when riding in both city centers and suburbs / smaller towns?

EBoard is not allowed to be ridden on the path walk no matter how slow you go. You're only allowed to ride it with top speed of 6km/h and you're a crippled. For safety, just try not to eskate the pathwalk, ethically is not right either.

Everything that goes faster than 5 km/h is considered illegal as far as I know. Because it'll fall into a certain category of vehicle. And for every vehicle in our by too many rules restricted country you need an insurance :sweat:

I don't think forced insurance is a bad thing when it comes to situations where other people could get involved. The problem is that we aren't legally able to _obtain_ insurance, even if we wanted to. The government has pretty strict rules on what a "vehicle" is, including a requirement for a steering wheel.

Considering how easy they give licences to gas scooters (below 50cc) to me it looks utterly stupid to ban such vehicles.

Heck they could invent some tests to prove that a person can steer good enough and brake in proper way and allow to legally use them.

Im pretty sure people would be willing to pay a fee or something if they were allowed to use bike pathes with at least 25kph as max speed.

Especially true for all the riders in Germany  who would not get fines and their boards confiscated as the german police seems to be doing now.. but yeh, who knows, it might be really more "practical" for german government just to scare off people than to allow some things

Totally agree with you there. They should make an urban electric vehicle category. In which electric longboards, unicycles and other forms of transport will fall. With options for insurance. For example; to qualify the vehicle needs to have the option to stop within lets say 15 meters when riding at a maximum speed of 30km/h. Proper lights, front white, back red. Done. It's gonna be hard to check these things and register them when we do DIY builds though.. the system needs to change.

Hi guys, from today 1.1.18 it seems that Denmark has legalized the use of electric skateboards.

Even if the rule says that the esk8 has to have a max weight of 10kg and a maximum speed of 20km/h with a maximum range of 30km on a single charge, it is a good starting point and maybe an example/argument that can be brought in if stopped by police. Denmark is an EU country and it seems strange that EU would have different regulations on vehicles.

Here some links, I used google translate to read them, so I might have miss or misunderstood something. Any thoughts on this?

esk8 are not allowed to 
1. go over 30km / 18.6miles on a single charge
2. go above 20km/h / 12.4mph.
3. weigh above 10kg / 22lbs

The law that is valid now in Denmark now has not legalized e-skating yet. The law gives authority to the Minister to make the rules for a "pilot / trail" without going through the parliament. The rules that Latemate is referring to is a proposals / draft of the rules that the Minister wants to make, but they are not set in stone yet. The last work process of the rules are supposed to be done this month (so soooon....) in cooperation with the police and other interest groups. Hopefully also a representative from the e-skate community. BUT the proposal is pretty thorough and they have spend a lot of time on it. I don't think it will change much. 
They suggest an age limit of 15 years if you want to ride on your own. If you are younger you can ride together with someone over 18. As a kid under 15 you are allowed to ride alone without an adult on playgrounds.
You can find the detailed (more detailed than what have been in the media) proposal here: http://www.ft.dk/samling/20171/lovforslag/L28/bilag/5/1819522.pdf

these values sounds good, except for the weight. 10 kg is a really light board only. If you wanna ride pneumatics on an street-, or even worse, a mountainboard, it will be illegal due to overweight.

Other than that, props to the minister who sees that a change in law is needed!

Yes they have actually made a pretty good job. There are a few things we will try to see if we can change. We have to be realistic to what would be possible to influence. The point that you make about the weight is exactly one of the things I think would be realistic to influence. If we can make a good argument I think they will listen. 
The most important work has to be done in order to make other see e-skating as a equal way of transportation. There are two big interest groups here that have been invited to the last part of the legalization process, and they are NOT happy. They use strong words against the legalization. They want to ban e-skating. But the minister is liberal and wants to move on. Thats good for us.

To charge a 300Wh battery (about 27km range) and a Kilowatt-hour of energy (1000Wh) costs 15c
So you can go 27km for about 4c, The energy is clean But there are issues How will the Government Tax such low costs? will they tax for the electricity used maybe 7cents instead of 4cents.
And what about the People Who make billions off selling Fuel?

Probably nice to have an overview of the total amount of EU countries that allow it? From what i can find, please correct if wrong:

Legal:
- Finland (if ≤ 25 km/h, if < 1 kW)
- Sweden (if ≤ 20 km/h)
- Denmark (if ≤ 20 km/h)
- Norway (if ≤ 20 km/h)
- Belgium (if ≤ 18 km/h) (if ≤ 25 km/h in progress, est. valid. 2021)
- France (if ≤ 25 km/h) (still a fine possible, according to some sources)

Not legal:
- Netherlands
- Germany (maybe: legal if ≤ 6 km/h)
- Austria
- UK
- Swiss
- Italy (maybe: legal if ≤ 6 km/h)
- Ireland 

(Spain, Cech, Kroatia, Poland?)

In Belgium we have the same rights as electric bikes. Only difference is non bikes electrics are only legal if they cannot go faster than 18kph whereas electric bikes are allowed to 25kph. Sidewalks are limited to 5kph. Protections not mandatory. Bikelane usage is mandatory if there is one. 
Probably one of the best countries in that regard, no cop should fine you as long as you're not blatantly faster than 20kph.

That's mostly correct, but I do believe we still need an insurance... It's like the Segway, you also need an insurance for that.

Never the less, I've crossed paths with about 50 cop cars by now of which 15+ definitely knew I was electric and I haven't been stopped a single time.

I have a Yuneec ego since almost 2 years now (so 20kmh max, looks like a normal longboard), and I've been using it regularly to go to work around Eindhoven.
I've never encounter any issue with the cops, but on another hand I am mostly in a park, not visible from the road.
Hopefully this will stay like this, especially since I'm waiting on a more powerful board!

@luuckyy94  Depends a lot where you are going! I have been planning trip to Åland (island that is part of Finland but that operates autonomously). Was there couple years back with bike and it would suit for longer esk8 trip as well. Shorter nature inspired trips you can find outside every city, in Finland you dont have to go far to find yourself surrounded by forest or lakes/sea.

Hi Pjotr! Thanks for the contribution. According to the national police website the speed limit is still < 18km/h: 
- http://www.lokalepolitie.be/centrex/nl/archief/archief/voortbewegingstoestellen-eenwielers.html
- 'motorized propulsion devices', that is to say, any motor vehicle with two or more wheels capable of building and engine power, on a horizontal road, can not travel faster than 18 km per hour. Even though they have an engine they are not equated with motor vehicles.

Would like to hear which source you used! Thanks in advance.

That's so ill informed & poorly researched it's laughable, edited like a poor man's Casey video & I'd call it that too, except for the fact that it would  be an insult to all the B-Casey's worldwide.

The law is very clear on Ireland, motorised vehicles must be taxed and insured with some exceptions- pedal assisted ebikes with no throttle and max power output, Segway under special provisions.

So what is actually happening is this geezer is targeting people in their official capacity to outline the law, the fact remains that if you want to register any non-mass produced vehicle for the road in Ireland then you must go through the single vehicle registration process, it's very onerous and expensive. 

If the vehicle is signed off as being road worthy then it will be entered in the revenue system at which point a low level official as quoted by said geezer can take some €€€ and issue a registration certificate. This also allows for a motor tax certificate to be purchased and displayed on the vehicle.

There is a question of having a competency licence, but no need to worry it's not classified under anything so perfectly legal to ride without any licence....but and this is the huge but

It doesn't stop there, at this point you need insurance and there is no insurance company who are willing to cover these they will laugh at you.

What the police(guards in Ireland) are doing is turning a blind eye when they approve or how the rider is using the esk8 and probably stopping those who they disapprove of, in regards to speed, safety, consideration to others and choice of location.


Eventually the scrotes will ruin this blind eye approach when too many of them clog up the head injuries ward without medical insurance or take out innocent bystanders

The holiday was conceived in 2004 by the International Association of Skateboard Companies (IASC) to help make skateboarding more accessible to the world through various events held in major cities around the world. In 2006, more than 350 events took place in 32 countries around the world, and, the following year, the IASC received Special Congressional Recognition from US Congresswoman Loretta Sanchez for its work in promoting the sport of skateboarding and encouraging young people to get outside and enjoy the sport.[1]

*ENGLISH BELOW*

Ha Joost,

Wat goed om te zien dat er mensen zoals jij zijn die zich hard willen maken voor het legaliseren van elektrisch skateboarden. Ik denk echter dat een relatief kleine demonstratie geen zoden aan de dijk zal zetten. Om daadwerkelijk door te dringen tot de wetgever denk ik dat het volgende vereist is: 

(1) objectieve onderzoeksresulaten dat elektrische voortbewegingstoestellen het wegverkeer niet onredelijk verstoren, wellicht dat een van onze Finse collega's hierbij kunnen helpen; 
(2) een daadwerkelijk plan opstellen om in de wet enige veiligheidsregels op te nemen bij het gebruik van voortbewegingstoestellen; 
(3) objectieve onderzoeksresultaten met betrekking tot de toevoeging en de voordelen van elektrische voortbewegingstoestellen; denk aan energiebesparing of het voorkomen van overlast. 

Dit zijn lastige punten waar we niet 'zomaar' aan voorbij zouden kunnen gaan. Daarnaast denk ik dat de Nederlandse wetgever niet de meest verstandige route is. Zoals Laurnts al eens heeft aangegeven lijkt me de EU een betere instantie om dit aan te kaarten, gelet op het standpunt met betrekking tot duurzaamheid.

Groetjes!

_________________________________________

Dear Joost,

Good to see that there are people like you who would like to see that e-skating will become legal. Still, i don't think that a relatively small demonstration will do 'any harm'. To really get a plan to the legislater you'll definitely need a few subjects:

(1) objective number about the safety of elektric vehicles on public road; maybe our Finnish colleagues can help with that
(2) a concrete plan about safety measures for the use of elektric vehicles
(3) objective number about the benefits and use of elektric vehicles; for example power saving or prevention of  noise pollution.

These subject are pretty hard to state and prove. Set asside; i don't think the Dutch parliament should be dealing with this. Like Laurnts has sayd, the EU is probably a better institution for these arguments, since they care more about environment.

Greetings, Luc!

good morning im just back from my nightshift 
thnks for the good reactions to my post 
i say aswell that the EU properly will be a better bet since there are allready countries out there where its legal 

i like the objectives you say and i think the ansers are already out there or in the making of it 
thnks again to our finnish friends

but i think a demonstation is in order aswell just to get our voice's heart
especialy when we group up around the world in every captital city
20-100 people per city world wide is still a lot and hopefull get some attention becouse its everywhere and not just the netherlands is the problem 
and since go skate day is the day after lets get the skaters in aswell i like the date:P
im working on a letter in good dutch to the nos (ps not in my crappy inglish)
and ill be working on more support from all sides 
like go skate day it would be awesome to have meetings everywhere and just wake the sleeping giants

we already know that personal mobility divices can be of a great advantage to every city climet and safety is inportent aswell i think we already have the tech for it just and we just have to get our minds together and figure it with our goverment or possible the EU

its just insane we can get a ticket around 700-900 or distruction fuck that
we must fight to make it legal or just like our weed poletie just make te police watch a other way (gedoog beleid voor eboards)
any prograss will do

but in any case lets make them hear that there people here that find the law wrong
so thnks again and lets do something while in the mean while we work on the objectives

thnks everyone have a good day or for me night
cia

greetings joost

Yeah it was 380 + 9 (administration costs lol) Euro's.

The fine is basically for driving something motorized without a license plate.

He mentioned he could take my board but that he couldn't take it with him on his motor.

Yes this is in The Hague right next to my work where I was heading.

Got it! Then the following list is juridically checked:

"Probably nice to have an overview of the total amount of EU countries that allow it? From what i can find, please correct if wrong:

Legal:
* Finland (if ≤ 25 km/h, if < 1 kW)
* Sweden (if ≤ 20 km/h)
* Denmark (if ≤ 20 km/h)
* Norway (if ≤ 20 km/h)
* Belgium (if ≤ 18 km/h) (if ≤ 25 km/h in progress, est. valid. 2021)
* France (if ≤ 25 km/h) (still a fine possible, according to some sources)

Not legal:
* Netherlands
* Germany (maybe: legal if ≤ 6 km/h)
* Austria
* UK
* Swiss
* Italy (maybe: legal if ≤ 6 km/h)
* Ireland"

@luuckyy94: Maybe interesting to state for Belgium: If higher then 25km/h it is still legal if you then take the mandatory insurance. From that moment you are seen as a scooter class B and need to take in account the same rules.

No idea if it's the same in other countries.

Edit: scooter class B, not A

I couldn't find any official government website that clearly states the following sentence: If the speed exceeds 18km/h (or 25km/h in the future) the device is coincided a scooter. But found it on multiple other websites (that have somewhat of a name). eg: https://www.touring.be/nl/artikels/hoverboard-segway-co-welke-regels-van-de-wegcode-moet-je-respecteren

Maybe it is then seen as class P(speed pedelecs)
https://mobilit.belgium.be/nl/wegverkeer/inschrijving_van_voertuigen/kentekenplaten/elektrische_fietsen).
I don't think the law is very clear about it yet but in any way if coincided class B or P scooter it needs:
* COC
* Licence plate
* Insurance
* Drivers licence
* Etc

Honestly I/we can't really tell you if its safe. It really depends on the officer that stands in front of you. I had officers waving, greeting and giving me a thumbs up. Other guys had officers stop them and give them a warning.  At this moment its just a matter of luck. But if you ride around always pay attention and give way for other road users since you are unpredictable to them.

[Dita Charanzová (ALDE, CZ)](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/meps/en/124708/DITA_CHARANZOVA/home), rapporteur, said: “Today, we found a good balance between greater protection for victims of accidents and preventing absurd overregulation. Motor insurance should not be required for anything with wheels and a motor, like kids’ toys or e-bikes. This would only increase premiums for owners and slow down the uptake of alternative vehicles. I am happy e-bikes are excluded”.

Sounds good though anything over 250w is still grey area and by law considered being moped which needs registration..

Im waiting for regulation which would allow self built vehicles up to 2500W with maybe minor inspection, like brake, blinker, maximum speed check and such..

Otherwise only the big players can manufacture and licence vehicles over 250W, while also making them legal to be registered and used on roads.. which is a shame since these will cost way more than self built ones and not always offer all the options / extras, a self built one might offer..

---
Or a step forward would be to make a platform/base for a vehicle, which can be registered and then improved upon.. installing electronic/drive components as needed

---
On a side, @laurnts I saw a while ago u posted a picture with eboard and licence plate for it.

How did the process go? And is it just for insurance or can u ride roads as a moped with speed up to 45kmh?

We the esk8nl group are working on it. But  its hard to legalise is since the current rules are too old to apply to EV's. So they would have to completely change the rules.
For instance ebikes are legalised but they are an exception to the current rules wich makes them legal. We might want to aim for that wheb trying to make them legal.

Ik denk dat velen jouw poging om de wetgeving te verbeteren kunnen waarderen, maar enkele zaken had je misschien anders kunnen verwoorden.

Zaken zoals, "we don't fucking care" en "try to stop us" stelt ons in een kwaad daglicht en maakt eerder een parodie van het hele verhaal in plaats van dat je op een serieuze manier deze zaak wilt bespreken. Wij zijn geen Satudarah of Hells Angels.

maar het was beter geweest als ik alleen zij we dont care  had gespreven onderandere 

spellings check was helaas onmogelijk omdat ik in een window moest schrijven en er niet uit kon kopieren naar notepad werd 1 lange zin van 3 km naar rechts 
dat het zo mooie pdf geworden achteraf  kwam pas na het insturen ik hoop dat ze er  hier en daar overheen kunnen lezen  en de ernst kunnen inzien van de situatie die momenteel niet leefbaar is voor ons

 en ik geloof echt dat wij volgens de grondwet onze vrijheid ontnomen is maar het brengt de messeage wel en hoe ik mij momenteel voel over dit onderwerp en hoe aburt de vervolging is
maar ik denk wel aangezien hoe ik mij voel en onze regeering ook wel weet dat onze wetgeving een hooks is dat ze hier wel op gaan reageren en waarschijnlijk hoop voor een gesprek word uitgenodigt
en Enthousiasme er van af springt anders sta ik elke dag in denhaag wand dat stukje meen ik als het nodig is om elke dag er voor de deur te staan ik doe het

daarnaast ik heb een verzerkering die me onder deze voorwaarden wil verzekeren
en ik laat mijn board als gehandicapten voertuig voorlopig verklaren om mij gewoon te kunnen verzekeren
en ik heb en advocaat om dit hard te maken 
maar we moeten gewoon met ze om de tavel om om zo snel mogelijk atleast een gedoog beleid in te stellen dat is het minste wat ze voor ons kunnen doen ik heb maar een wajong en boetes zijn meer als me inkomen per maand

ik hou jullie op de hoogte van hun reactie groetjes joost

Sorry, maar zoals @Steven1 al zei zal ik deze brief absoluut niet versturen. In het beste geval wordt deze genegeerd, in het slechtste tegen je gebruikt.

Een aantal dingen die veel beter moeten wil je dat je serieus genomen wordt:

* De brief moet **veel** korter. Dit is een betoog van 9 kantjes, die ik nieteens helemaal gelezen heb omdat die zo lang was. Denk je dat de assistenten van de minister hier alles gaat lezen? Houd het op 2 of 3 alinea's, dit hoort geen betoog te zijn maar een vraag voor een uitnodiging om je betoog te houden. 
* De toon is respectloos op z'n best. Ik zou even terug opzoeken hoe je een [formele brief](https://www.cambiumned.nl/theorie/schrijven-en-spreken/schrijven/brief-schrijven/) hoort te schrijven.
* De brief is erg beschuldigend, zo wordt je niet uitgenodigd op een gesprek.
* Ik vind het engels erdoorheen heel apart, dit is een Nederlandse brief dus behalve een of twee onvertaalbare woorden hoort alles Nederlands te zijn.
* Meteen over een dictatuur te beginnen en over dat je rechten worden geschonden zal ook niemand serieus nemen.
* Ik heb ook last van dyslexy, maar het aantal spelfouten hierin is wel extreem. Als het niet mogelijk is om dit eerst in word te maken en daarna te kopiëren (wat ik betwijfel) kan je altijd de brief door iemand anders laten lezen.

Ik vind esk8 prachtig, maar als ik deze brief lees zou ik het eerder actief gaan verbieden. Door dit soort brieven te schrijven is iedereen slechter af. Ik hoop dat je hierdoor nog twee keer nadenkt voor je de brief verstuurd.

Ik sluit me hier volledig bij aan. Door dit soort acties (hoewel goed bedoeld) wordt de esk8-community in Nederland slecht vertegenwoordigd en worden kansen verspeeld om serieus te worden genomen.

Esk8 en andere elektrische eenpersoonsvoertuigen kunnen naar mijn verwachting een cruciale rol gaan spelen in modern personenvervoer waar auto's uit dichtbebouwde gebieden zullen worden geweerd, dus is het belangrijk om professioneel en opbouwend te communiceren.

@joosthebly  Als je de mogelijkheid hebt, trek dan voor nu alsjeblieft deze brief terug. Ik geloof dat er genoeg mensen in deze community zijn die willen meedenken over een nette en constructieve manier om de overheid te benaderen.

Thanks for the mention @laurnts 

June 27th, the week after some memo was sent around at the police, I was stopped by traffic police on Oudedijk in Rotterdam while commuting home from work. 30km/h in the bikelane respecting my surroundings and every traffic law there is.

Saw a bike accident unfolding 5 meters infront of me so I came to a stop, only to see a police Mercedes stopping on the road to my left. Without showing any interest/care for the bicyclists, he went straight for the "show me your insurance". Don't have that, so I played dumb ("oh I thought it was allowed at 25km/h") as I was unaware we are actually legal back then.

Informed me that my Evolve could be confiscated, and that it will be when I get caught again. I was to receive the fine in the mail as he claimed to not know how much it'd end up being.
It's for driving a motorized vehicle without insurance, and the amount is **€410 + €9** in fees, but i'm not allowed to pay it if I want to appeal the matter. I did appeal, and as of now i've only received a "we received your request, and handed it over to the guys higher up". **My best guess is that i'll receive a letter telling me to show up to court soon.**

Obviously, I am more anxious riding on public roads now, but can't give up my transportation method because of it, so I still ride the board sometimes, and I now own a Onewheel too, which I use daily.

If you've got quick and affordable access to a lawyer that'd be the best option. Once you receive the fine you have 14 days to write up your appeal.

Otherwise there's a few things you should research. So far i've found that skateboards are not defined as vehicles in Dutch law (so they can't be motorized **vehicles**) and that esk8's similar to a boosted (32km/h, small urethane wheels, dual drive and *two 20v batteries*) are specifically defined as a 'sport entertainment product' by the head of customs/imports at the European Union, meaning they are to be treated like regular skateboards (belong on sidewalk and bikepath) and don't require insurance. All EU members also need to respect and apply 'typegoedkeuring' that was given by any of the member states, but I haven't been able to find a country that did this, as far as I know they (denmark, belgium, etc) just allow them on roads without it.

There's probably more loopholes because our government clearly doesn't give a shit about road safety or keeping the law up to date. Let us know what you find :)

That is a really good point. Do you have a source for that, so I can use it if ever needed? I wasn't able to find it with a quick Google search. I believe you and all, but I think a actual news source is better than some random guy on the forum for the appeal 🙃

Thank you so much for the help!! I will definitely circle back once I got more information to help us!
Btw, I saw this on RDW website : https://www.rdw.nl/zakelijk/branches/fabrikanten-en-importeurs/typegoedkeuring-aanvragen/typegoedkeuren-voertuigen/voertuigcategorieen

seems that onewheel is the safest bet for NL as they only define vehicles that have 2 wheels and above

Hey @censink, any news about your appeal? If one of us fights this in court and wins, it might create a legal precedent that would make it easier for everybody else.

No updates at all on my end.

I have however attended an EUC'ers trial which ended up being turned into a suspended sentence (voorwaardelijke straf) for 1 year, meaning he won't have to pay his fine unless he gets another fine for the same offense within said year. This obviously doesn't satisfy us so we've encouraged him to further appeal this judgement.

Hello,
I "work" with a collective of french people to improve PLEV recognition, defend users rights and do some prevention. It is called ANUMME (htttp://www.anumme.fr).
In France, it is going to be legal. It was unclear until now.
Mains rules : limited to 25 km/h, include all PLEV, single people, no power limit, forbiden outside of cities.
We plan to ask to Europe for another category for PLEV going up to 45 km/h (like L1e-B of EU rules R168/2013).
If you are interested to work, at european level, for PLEV recognition, please contact us at contact@anumme.fr . I think we have plenty of informations to share with you.

Seperate category for vehicles up to 45kph would be nice. 

So far what I have found is that mopeds can be up to 4kw, but currently you probably need gas engine moped and then convert it to electric, to make it legal. Plus depending on country there might be extra inspection for this

Yes, everything going above 25 km/h requiere a type approval by an european country.
The L1e-B category allows up to 4kw motor and 45 km/h... BUT it needs a seat (and many other things). Not really PLEV compatible ;)
Our goal is to open a new category, very similar to L1e-B but without seats, compatibles for wheels, electric scooters, esk8...

I really want to get an electric longboard to go to my job but I scared that I might get a fine or worst see my longboard confiscated by the cops.

I am working near Eindhoven. What do you tjink about it? I read a bad stories in this forum but do you need to be unlucky to get arrested by the police if you ride safely???

Hello, we also created a European talking group about PLEV (electric skate, electric scooter, wheels ...)  laws : 
https://t.me/anumme_europe

You are welcome to come and talk about all kind of PLEV and laws in europe.
We can explain how PLEV are currently introduced in French laws, and help you to get the major talking points if you want to introduce PLEV laws in your countries.
