This is a good looking first build! Good Job! How does it run? More stats!
Love how you inserted the batteries partly inside the board!

Here are the stats of the build:
The board I had and is made of bamboo(good stiff material) ordered the caliber trucks and Abec knockoff wheels thru Amazon. Batteries I had,(6s2p). Sk3-6354 260 kv motor,turnigy 150 amp esc, quantum 2.4 ghz remote. I'll list approximate cost below.
Board $65
Trucks $46
Wheel and bearings $72
Motor $60
Esc $80
Remote $26 
And don't for the obvious 
Enersion motor mount. $126

The board is real solid and had a little help from my friends, and a lot of excellent idea from this site. It has a top speed of 22-23 mph and is fun as hell. I'm already build my next one
