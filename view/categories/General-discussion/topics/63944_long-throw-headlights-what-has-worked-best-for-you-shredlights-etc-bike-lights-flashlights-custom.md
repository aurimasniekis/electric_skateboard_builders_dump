Looking through the https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/eskate-lights-thread/199/354 there are tons of different ways to achieve headlights. Though whats the visibility range you all are getting? I'm looking to purchase some lights but I need a simple setup with far throw say at least 20ft due to the trails I ride at night plus its just gives you a bit more confidence when riding at speed.

Recently I purchased:
https://www.ebay.com/itm/SolarStorm-15000Lm-3xXML-T6-LED-Head-Bicycle-Bike-Lamp-Light-Rear-Light-16000mAh/322656749160?ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT&var=511675710648&_trksid=p2060353.m2749.l2649

which I really like, comes with a 4 cell pack and all metal casing plus it's super bright and has a decent throw of about 15ft mounted underneath and three brightness settings. Problem is that is will require some effort mount. There's no clean or easy solution. I've learned that these lights have to be extremely well secured or they will vibrate loose, so I'll have to design and 3D print something which will take some time (on the plus the electronics are super simple).

![IMG_20180803_204239|375x500](upload://pUOR06Pd2iDeeFhCrOPdcVTpgeD.jpg)

So what kind of illuminated range are you getting with your setup? What are you using?

BTW, I've tried a few different cheap led flashilghts but they're basically just good enough for alerting pedestrians, not avoiding pot holes. Plus some have completely died from the vibrations.

I carry this in my off hand.  Bright enough to see 50ft ahead, and way brighter than shredlights which are purely cosmetic (80 lumens aint shit).

@Static  - I have these lights and they are great - survived vibration for well over 6 months. I power them from a 36V/8V converter from main battery pack.   A friend made a very nifty Aluminium bracket to mount on truck bolts . They are tucked away under the deck and don't move !   ![Landy|666x500](upload://cq7MGswZVZrhTySNpSr4BcjXE7s.jpg)![Landy%20Photo%204%20|632x500](upload://z0v7YYLpEXgSK5IXPEeKRlUYjXl.jpg)![Landy%20Photo%203%20|666x500](upload://xLouN7K9slMzmgQ04SWo7BLE3Bg.jpg)

Nice. Yes those lights can take a beating. Dual setup must be insanely bright. I'm thinking of slimming down the enclosure about half size and moving the electronics in with the battery box so I can tuck it under the nose.

Would really like to mount the LEDs as headlights in the riser, but I think these get a little hot.

Sorry for the long post, I'm a long time flashaholic (yes there are such things) :)

I feel like board mounted lights are really only good for letting others know you're there. The angle's all wrong for actually illuminating the road ahead, especially if going 20+mph.

Also, lower color temperature, neutral white or warm white, make the road debris and imperfections pop way better than cool white. High CRI is even better, but the better the quality of light gets, the less lumens you have. Worth it though, to go to at least NW.

I'm finding about 1500lumens NW is about minimum for useful light, at least hand held. 1000 lumens is okay if it's tightly focused. I use the light for commuting so it can't be stupid huge.

So far I've tried a bunch of handheld lights. Went through a bunch of mid to high end 18650 lights. My EDC is a Zebralight SC63w. Amazing great EDC but at about 1000 lumens with a floody beam, great light in front of the board but can't look far enough. My Old EDC, an Eagletac D25LC2 tactical, neutral white, was not enough lumens.

http://www.zebralight.com/SC63w-18650-XHP35-Flashlight-Neutral-White_p_177.html

http://www.eagletac.com/html/d25lc2rc/index.html

Next, tried a tighter beam. The heads need to be big to focus the beam. Tried some random Costco aspheric zoom light, horrible as expected. Tried Eagletac SX30C2 NW with 1x18650. Better, but beam too tight, and a bit dim. 

http://www.eagletac.com/html/sx30c2/index.html

Tried Emisar D1 and D4, good light but too hot hot!

On the recommendation of a flashlight modder, I tried Olight R50. Hello, we're good! 26650 and a bigger light means it gets hot but we're not throttling as much. Beam pattern and lumens are almost perfect. The LED is not neutral white but the color is pretty good. It's hitting the sweet spot in size, capacity, beam and brightness for eskate.

https://olightworld.com/olight-r50-seeker

I'm thinking maybe a wrist mount or helmet mount for this thing...

For board mounted, I've got the light you guys have shown but the light is so cold and the thing feels so chintzy.

I've purchased these, and will try them mounted a bit higher on the board.

(this one has more heatsink and 18w)

The build is much heavier, really beefy, for motorcycles I think. It also has wide voltage input range. Beam pattern is excellent. Color seems reasonable.

Can just run a line direct from the pack. 15w / 40v = .375a, so maybe 22awg wire and a toggle switch of some sort. Maybe a 3 way switch, as it has a 6w low beam.

It's a solid chunk of aluminum, nice and heavy.

I have the two led version of that light or at least a similar one. My coil came loose and rattled around and finally broke the wire. I had to solder it and hot glue it in place. It’s working great now. I thought I would mention that since you had it apart.

Like deuesedown, I'm pretty heavily into flashlights and I agree that board mounted lights are primarily good at making you visible, not helping you see long distances.  They're just too close to the ground to really light up your riding surface.

Either handheld or a helmet mounted light will do waaaay better at helping you see.  Both is good is you are willing to spend the time/money.  Most mountain bike guys do a floody handlebar light plus a more tightly focused helmet light.

I'm looking at picking up a Magicshine MJ900B for helmet mounting.  They're got a good rep in bike circles are being killer quality for the price.  I've been trying to find a TIR helmet light but they just don't seem to exist.

Good to hear that other people are having luck with the light I purchased. I think its bright enough. Pretty sure I am going to cut the case in half and separate the electronics so the smaller light portion can fit under the nose for a clean install.

I need a quick solution though since I'm traveling this week and would be great to have. So I opted for 4 of those cheap zoomable flashlights that use 18650s. I think these will work with some rubber clamps attached to the truck bolts for temporary use. I think if I glue down the internals really well it should last. If not it's little money wasted they're about $4 each.

Hands down when riding on trails at night I use a secondary handheld light. But out on downtown streets at night I don't want to be blinding pedestrians and also have my other hand free so I think a good board mounted option is the ultimately the most preferred. 

Actually I think what a lot of people want is something seamless and integrated that you don't really notice. My belief is that lights somehow built into a 0.5" deck riser would be the cleanest install (assuming it could work well). That and remoted controlled headlights+taillights would be my end all.

When you're around other folks, no doubt.  Be polite and leave the photon cannon at home.

I think I just assumed flashlight nerd level of bright when I read "long throw".  Most of the trails by me have no lights at all so I'm planning on bringing out the big guns when I ride at night.

I'd be limited to maybe 12mph without handheld or a headlight... which might not be a terrible thing.

I use a handheld light even on a push board. I've run into too many gnarly crazy stuff on the pavement.

I pulled the trigger one model up, 902 with 1600 lumens (the minimum for my eyes and speed and conditions). Wallet hurts! But it's tiny and looks well built. TIR looking good.

![IMG_20180906_204729|666x500](upload://iEv5WfMfABrMB265ntVa77YcQJa.jpg)

That pack is huge, 2s3p 5200mah. I think I'll build a 2x1p with 30q with enough wire to get to a jacket pocket. Should be plenty.

I hope this thing throws enough. I don't think I can stomach the price and heat of the next model up.

Thanks for linking. I caught it on one of those ebay 15% sales.

EDIT OMG the phone app is spyware looking and requires login? Pshhhh. I wanted just 1 mode, but not worth all the hassle. Get the non bluetooth version boys.

Dope chin mount, dude!  I'm going to try mounting mine on top of my helmet and see how that goes.

The light itself is actually pretty sweet.  Especially for the price.  Good beam pattern, giant battery pack, decent color temp.  But holy crap that app is dumpster fire.

I'd have put it on top if not for that visor... Made everything complicated lol.

I'm checking out the power draw. at 7.2v started at 2a, dropped quickly to 1.6a, then to 1.3a, and about a minute later we're down to 1.2a, and there it stays.

Hmm... It'll do better when moving, but if lumens is proportional to amps, that's 960lumens, which is okay if the beam is tight. I'll get to try it out soon enough I guess. The next one up is 3200 lumens but if we're thermal throttling, I'd be surprised if it was much brighter in practice.

I agree, form factor is great, tint is great, beam pattern looks a bit floodier than I'd like for this application, but nice.

sigh these magicshine got me. with the ebay 15% coupon I nabbed the 906b light only.

The 902b is good but not quite enough light to see road hazards at speed.

This time at 8.4v, starts at 4.25a, drops quickly to 3.78a (35watt!!) and steps down about 0.5a every 10-20 seconds all the way down to 1.35 (hot hot hot). Very respectable amount of light. I'm worried the lumens are just widening the beam though. Will see soon enough if it's an improvement.

2 x 30q is about 22wh, which should give me about 30min usable I think, which is perfect for my 16 minute evening commute.

I'm gonna have to deal with the phone app though... At 3200 lumen I need to tweak the settings to have 2 levels: max, half. And get rid of that strobe.

Oh btw the chin mount is great. :)

Yo getting an old thread bumped !

I noticed everybody here do mount their lights on baseplate or on top of board. Which means when you carve, you don't light up in the direction you're going but straight forward of the board instead. 

So I got this random idea : how about a light mount designed like a motor mount ? So when you lean, your lights follow where you're going instead of lagging "behind". Should be easy to 3D print too right ? What cons do you see with this solution ?

No real issue with this idea. It might be more difficult to design and look right. Integrating something into a riser is easy. Mounting the lights lower on truck will also decrease the illuminated range when they are lower to the ground

Never had any success with those cheap flashlights. They all short out eventually from vibration.

I'm testing an idea using the led's from a couple flashlights I had left. Hardwiring better connections should be more resistant to the abuse.

I will send you one to try out. I have a set of shred lights I just converted to hard wire and will work with the setup. 
the 3s id 3 Samsung 30q, I tested it on a static 12 hours straight with the  BT RBG LEDs on.

I believe both can run off the battery

i bought these motorcycle headlights off amazon. $20 for a pair. Best solution ive found so far. ive been experimenting with all types of lights for about 2 months now. VERY precise throw, with slight spread. The sticker serves as  diffuser AND projector cutoff to avoid blinding people because they are B R I G H T!!!

Iv'e got the same light and am busy trying to add it to my board. What converter did you use to run this from your main battery? I'm trying to do the same thing at the moment.

I've tried a few light bars and this is currently is my favorite. Its a flood and spot light combo so gives you a pretty good balance of light throw and spread. used this one for a couple months now without any issues and i can never see my self using any sort of shred light or similar products again they just are not bright enough for going fast at night confidently. Also you get 2 of them for ONLY $30.

My favorite headlights so far are ones that have been used a million times.

Most people are putting a small seperate battery in their build to power them. This is unneeccesarry becuase the light has a built in dimmer. This means that a current control device isn't needed, as long as the leds have a matching voltage supply. I use an ordinary step down converter from china for it. Anything that drops the voltage (adjustable) is perfect. It just needs to be about 5w minimum of output
