I tried searching this and have contacted @trampa 's website support but haven't heard back. I'm running on [fivestar hubs from MBS](https://www.mbs.com/parts/13211-mbs-fivestar-hub-1-white) now. MBS says these hubs support 8" and 9" wheels 

I love the color options and style of the [Trampa tires](http://www.trampaboards.com/8-inch-tyres-c-293.html) though. I notice that, specifically, Trampa states that " The  ***STRIKER***  tyre will fit to all known  ***[Hubs](http://www.trampaboards.com/hubs-c-256.html)***  that are commonly used for Mountainboarding &amp; Kiteboarding."

Can any of the 8 or 9 inch Trampa tires fit MBS hubs?

8" tires fit 8 inch hubs, 9" tires fit nine inch hubs, easy as that. I would not put an 8" tire onto a 9" hub. The hub will stand prone and will get smashed up sooner than later. The concept of a combo hub is not really working in reality.
