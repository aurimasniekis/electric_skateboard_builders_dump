Hey Guys,

I want to edit the title of one of the topics I posted, but it looks like I can't. The edit symbol is grey and when I click it, I can only view the history.

Is there any way to still edit the title of the topic? I would like to close beta testing but, for now, the project is forever stuck in the testing phase.
