Hey guys

Requested by some guys and because the first batch is sold out I will do a second pr√©-order round on the caliber mounts.

Some small updates:

- Clamp will be cnc milled instead of lasered for more accuracy
- Setscrew will be at the oter side, so when you hit the side walk impact will not be on the screw head but on the full surface of the clamp. Tipped by: @ShawnyP 

You can make the pre-order **[here](https://electricboardsolutions.com/collections/pulleys-belts-mounts/products/caliber-mount-v2-pre-order)**

I will also make a version with idler pulleys. Using these:

(not in pre-order, need to find some time to design them properly)

Some pics (sorry I don't have really well made pictures :face_with_raised_eyebrow: ):

Haha that would be awesome! I also live in the netherlands ;)

But sadly enough I don't have the money for a new built because I would buy the motormount right away. But I am busy with my first build, have bought already stuff for my second built and my parents aren't very happy about that hahaha

Will you make another preorder for the version with the Idler or should i preorder now? Do you have some pictures for it already. And what Belt length is needed for the standard combination 15/36?

And what is the weight of the set?
```

Yes if there is demand for a pre-order on the idler mounts I will :slight_smile:

No pictures yet but when it's done it will 3d print it and make some pics :slight_smile:

The weight of the previous mount was 300gram, V2 will be a bit ligheter because the clamp will be aluminum

Mount looks sweet! 
My only concern is that there is only 1 set screw as i mentioned on instagram.
Could you perhaps add another one just to be safe? ;)

The width is a tigth fit, and the setscrew is m8 it's pretty strong ;)

Didn't have problems with it :)

What do you mean that the width is a tight fit? 
One more hole for a setscrew shouldn't affect the mounts width?

I had issues with torque mounts that use 4 set screws, thats why im worried. (loosens over time)
One set screw on the bottom flat part and rear side flat part would be perfect IMO, then it will push the mount towards the truck from two directions instead of one.

The hanger is 18mm wide and the clamp is 18.1mm wide so I think there is not much need to put a setscrew there :) But I dan make an extra hole if you prefer :slight_smile:

Did you use thread locker on the setscrews of your motor mount?

Just trying to help out so it works well, im glad we finally have a company in EU that provides motormounts :slight_smile:
I do use thread locker and i had to tighten the set screws with a big ratchet to make it stay in place.

I guess your clamp is different than torqueboards, the torqueboard clamp is not a snug fit on the truck, it needs the setscrews to make it solid.
I guess if the clamp is a tight fit without tightening the screw it could be fine with one set screw :)  

Friend of mine pre-orderd 2 this morning when i told him they could be reversed mounted :slight_smile:

Hey guys

I just designed a first prototype and 3D printed it to test fit, I'm not there yet... Any good ideas to improve?

It's even with the 80mm otangs a bit to small, center distance is 85mm. I can't move the idler pulleys closer to the motor because the nuts of the bolts that hold the idler will touch the motor. I could make the plate even longer but that makes it more bulky and a longer plate will put more stress on the clamp.

Also would it better to have slots for the idlers instead of for the motor? I did it like it is now so the plate can be used without idlers aswell :slight_smile:

Grtz
Frederic

If possible the idler shouldn't be longer than the belt. Otherwise you can't use bigger wheels like 107mm.
```

Yes, or I could use longer plates but I don't like them to long :/

Idlers that sit flush with the belt would be great. In this case you could try to move the mount a bit away from the wheel so that you have like 2 mm distance between the belt and the wheel.
My enertion pulleys have a gap of like 2 mm to the wheel so a idler that ends at the belt would be perfect.
```

What is flush?

I will see what I can change, the bolts I used are to big anyway, it was just to test fit ;)
