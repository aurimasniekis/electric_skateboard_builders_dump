Globe a 41" Drop (HG Geminon Drop)

And Rayne has a 42" Drop DemonSeed

That's about the closest your gonna get to a long drop deck. 

Double drops don't work well for esk8

I have a drop down that I'm wanting to customize for someone its 8ply of hard rock maple so I would say it wouldnt meet your flexible or light requirements but the light weight is more on out much stuff you add to your board

i'm confused, a double drop deck normally does not flex much? :thinking:

little details of the demonseed make it sweet.... & I have mucho love for Decky-Bro but!

yeah I have one of those, a rayne reaper with moes NKP-3links, mounted: top mount...
still a double drop deck :) and they are normally in rayne speak "speed stiff"

the distance from the deck/foot placement line the evo is a double drop by mechanics regardless of if the truck is mounted to or bottom, it is mounted way above the deck...

Gotcha, yea Rayne doesn't offerthe nemesis or DemonSeed in Drop-Though any more just top mount single drop :confused:


But yes the severe drop puts it at double drop heights :)
