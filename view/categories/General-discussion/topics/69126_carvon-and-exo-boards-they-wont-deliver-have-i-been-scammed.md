I bought AN EXO BOARD from Carvon two months ago. They charged my card and I am out the money. I can not get them to give me a delivery date. They promise me an answer and never deliver. Anyone else having this experience? I hope these guys are not scamming me. Help!!I

They do deliver boards and have just been focusing on that more than getting updates out. It's just how they decided to handle production. Keep in mind this is pretty much a single person working on getting these boards out. 

If you prefer not to have the wait it would be better to just do a charge back but they certainly continue to deliver. That much is certain if you ask more of their customers here so it certainly isn't a scam.

I appreciate the feedback. I am prepared to wait. However, I would appreciate a delivery date and would love to hear from anyone out there who has gotten a board recently.  Thanks

No problem. as for the delivery date @Mikenopolis used to reach out on behalf of others concerned of their orders to jerry/@LEVer himself but He no longer does so because he isn't associated with Carvon in any way and just wanted to help backers and other customers out and it just became tiresome on @mikenopolis' part after awhile

I think there's a thread about Carvon delivery times here and you aren't the only one waiting. Others have waited much longer(many months or even a year) though that obviously doesn't help, you can ask them for their feedback too.

If you check the indiegogo campaign some have been delivered. They are going out, it's just a waiting game now. My guess, It's going to be a month or two for him to get all the back orders out.

You'd probably get yours before the IGG backers. Seems like that's how carvon fulfills the orders. The later you order the sooner you get your order.

just became tiresome
[/quote]

It’s not because I’m tired. I could do customer assistance all day since part of my normal job assist sales people and various employees and I sit in front of various monitors for a living.

The reason I took a step back with the communication was because Jerry is an adult. He came on when he had those few weeks off and answered questions, explained the delays and people slowly got their stuff. Then parts started arriving at his shop and he stopped being on the forum to work on drives, boards and people were still getting stuff. 

He had his list and is working down it and delivering as fast as he can. So me relaying message actually slows down the process a bit and diverts his attention.

@nlamel

The EXO motors are different. EXOs are making more progress compared to the EVOs. I think it comes down to EXO motors being mostly made Koowheel motors with minor machining needed where as the EVOs needed more assembly, and had issues with measurements.

EXO current hold up is lack of decks. EVOs...I have no idea, just that LHB has three build he's been commissioned and PAID for.

Enertion told me when I ordered my board a year ago that it would be to me in 3-4 months. 

I ordered Hummie hubs 9 months ago with a promise date of a few months. 

I ordered Carvon stuff (pair of xl drives, a bunch of exo's)a little less then a year ago and have received both my drives and a few exo's. 

If you want high quality innovative stuff it's a waiting game. Carvon is about on par with Enertion and Hummie as far as delay's, just worse when it comes to communication.

Carvon delays is unfortunate but happens. Not responding to customer emails is unprofessional. I paid $3000 for a EVO 4WD. They advertise a 3-5 week build time on their site. After 5 weeks I start emailing. Nothing. I want this company to succeed and would be understanding if they explained delays and were truthful with delivery estimates. In my last email I said if I don't hear back I'm filing a fraud claim with my credit card company and PayPal. 

How long have people waited for deliveries?? And is this nonresponse typical??

But all the vendors attacked me saying I’m making things up...

https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/discussion-about-diy-vendors-delivery-delays-communication-and-transparency/73650/368

We need more people to speak out.  I didn’t pay for a carvon evo, but I sympathize with you or anyone that did.  Giving a large sum of money to these vendors and putting your trust in them, just to have them ignore you or lie about delivery dates is unacceptable.

@photorph Honestly, I didn't disagree with most of your thread but I could see how your message could get misconstrued.  What you probably should have done is make a very short and to-the-point post in reference to only your experience instead of trying to make it a broader message.  Any time you speak in generalities people are going to think you are talking about them and get offended.

The only point I would say is most of the top builders know enough that they do not need to hire experts in different fields. The really complex stuff is the speed controllers and that is pretty much handled by the FOCBox.  I'd much prefer to ride a build from an experienced eskate builder with a few years of experience than some electrical engineer.

you are correct, I made it too general.  I wanted to avoid naming people, but that didn't go well.  

Possibly true about hiring people, but they should at least hire customer service people, some of them are not very professional...publicly mocking customers who complain.  You won't see well respected companies doing that.

Totally agreed about the customer service.  You have to at least always be available to talk to contact your customers in a reasonable amount of time and update on progress or somehow delegate to someone who can.  I think a lot of people just overlook that part of being a builder.

Facts 

1)Paid $1699 on KS for a 4wd board announced to arrive October 2017. Nothing yet and not a word since May 2018. Still waiting... 

2)Paid $363 for a battery pack promised to arrive on September 4th. Still waiting...

Small esk8 businesses live on communication, including this forum, social media, vendors reputation... Is communication useless now ? I sent money with trust. Was I right?
I have to admit I got a lesson and will prioritise shops and bigger vendors from now.

Enertion was just like this in the early days, but communication was there and obviously with the move to China, things are finally starting to flow better.

I've asked @lever to post updates here about EVO and EXO delays or news, that's really all I can do.

Thanks a lot for your efforts! You are right with enertion. I bought DIY stuff from enertion in the early days and Raptor1 later (still a fantastic board for power and range!) . Despite multiple delays and problems, we always felt as a group, a community, and kept close communication at all moments. We had no doubt that Jason was as passioned as us and did his best to deliver or solve problems. Jason created this forum then announced "officially" why he had to stop communicating here.

I also bought carvon motors and parts at the good old time when Jerry was responding emails :) I am sure he is pasionned (and an awesome engineer). That s exactly why I perked in the KS campaign. 

However I do not feel treated fairly in the 2 situations mentioned above (the second is not carvon) and the possibility that I have been scammed (not purposedly but as a result) is growing ...

In a community based on Internet communication, i would have concerns with members that do not respect the rule. I am also concerned with the attacks against those that dare posting we have problems with some vendors

I don’t think Carvon are scammers or intentionally dismissive of customers. The problem is incompetence. Jerry may be a talented builder with a game-changing product but not know how to run a business. Having a great “product” includes customer service, i.e. reasonable delivery timelines and support/service on the back-end if there’s a problem. 

And to your point, a vendor should not whine when you have a legitimate complaint (particularly if you’re a KS supporter!!). Building a customer base is hard – losing it is easy.

I need to discuss with my credit card company and PayPal how much delay is considered nonperformance. Then I will do a chargeback with fraud complaint. Next I’ll post a “Carvon: buyer beware” PSA on YouTube.

Business 101: “How do you make customers mad?” Answer: Take their money, don’t send them a product, then ignore them.

I don’t have any skin in this game but had I paid the $2-3k as some have, I would have been pissed to see Jerry at ESK8 Vegas. Probably paid for the trip with their money and I bet some of those Carvon buyers would have been there to participate had their orders been fulfilled.

As in gas money? We live in Southern California so it a drive. He was only there for one ride and he also stayed with his sister who lives in Vegas. Just saying.

Also. LHB and Psychotiller were there so EVO and EXO talks could be had so it’s not just fun and games? All speculation of course.

I don't really care about his finances or accommodations, it's a perception issue. Unfulfilled orders and no communication while actively participating in the esk8 community is a big FU to those that have backed him. 

Clearly it doesn't bother some and I don't have any money tied up with him so carry on.

The enclosure was a little tight around the esc. I used my heat gun and pliyers to loosen it up. The board has a bit of a curve to it so I heated up the sides and then clamped it down for a really nice fit. I love having a handle on my board so I put my old handle back on, but i need a deeper handle. It finally finished charging can’t wait for the rain to stop.

Because I used PayPal I've filed a claim through them rather than a chargeback with my credit card. Paypal is much slower. So far 4-5 emails or contacts have been sent to Carvon via PayPal with no responses. It's not just customers they're not responding to. If they're ignoring payment processing companies they're not going to be in business long. Carvon LLC has until 11/30/18 to respond - so I'll update you with the result. In the meantime why aren't you pulling your order??

I'd rather have the product than a refund - but he needs to communicate with me (and all of us with overdue orders) and verify that. I have patience to wait until the end of the year (not a day over). The non-responses just sound like a company going out of business and I'm worried about losing $3K.

I ordered Carvon motors on 11/8/2015.
Jerry shipped me motors on 1/13/2016.
I worked with Jerry to swap for V2 motors and shipped them back. Since then, it's literally been over 2 years trying to get him to respond. He would say, I'll ship you v3 motors. Then a year later v4. And constantly missing dates. Then suddenly, no responses now for 10 months. I've tried his Instagram, Facebook, Carvon website chat, and email. Every method of reaching him has had no response!

I've been out of a motor for 3 years now!

Yes zero news about kickstarter orders... They were made before IGG if I remember.
Jerry does nothing for us not to worry about loosing our money.
I understand he cannot reply everybody but a global update message on KS takes a few minutes.
I start to worry also about a European battery builder who is 4 monthes late and became incredibly less reactive by email after paiement than before... It is clear that I am not an isolated case. Don't you think that we should warn other forum members? I don't understand why we have to keep silent here about it...

I just started Paypal dispute to get money back from Kevin (they will not reimburse the evolve BMS i sent too). From what I read in this forum and others, I am not an isolated case and I wonder whether it legally qualifies as fraud
I ll try with CC company, for Jerry

Lee, the issue is that Kevin appears to just pick and choose who he's going to build for and just hold money from the others until they demand it back. It's very strange.

He needs to just stop taking payments, clear his backlog and sort his ethics out.

Talking to him every time he doesn't deliver would be a long process

@Touch415 He seems to be respected within the UK scene as far as I can see, I'm the founder and now co-owner of the UK group - nobody has reported anything to me. So respectfully please don't link my comments with your arse.

Anyways as promised I voluntarily reached out to him and he responded.  The gist of it is he doesn't come on here much anymore but he is super snowed under.

Now I am not affiliated with him and don't want to take any sides, I just volunteered to reach out to him.

 I understand he is snowed under but he doesnt respect the 30d delay he announced, made no excuses. When I finally reached him on IG he bullshited me an explanation that he accidentally lost my name from the list...

It is not hard to update. It is also fair (normal?) to propose reimbursement without us having to ask repeatedly and forever. The "no update but I keep your money" method used by Kevin and Jerry is {]¥÷}< It exactly looks as a scam or an intention of scam.

I’d bet he would love to do that. 

Unfortunately I think it just isn’t that simple and that he made some bad business decisions and to now respond at all here in a general post to address the upset of his customers would only hurt his business more. 
At least I think that’s what his thinking is about posting anything about it now. 

Try to run a business yourself and make mistakes then see how you’d react or address accordingly.

I did run a small business. Do you suggest it is not so simple to communicate "sorry guys, I failed and lost your money"? 
I pledged on KS because I bought Jerry s motors before, respected his innovative spirit and previous breakthroughs and trusted him. I was ready to understand and accept any difficulties in design and manufacturing, especially knowing his obsession with perfection.
Esk8 become very competitive and crowded with new quality offers, fair service and delays and prices go down. In this context, loosing support from early adopters, the kind of customers who are buying all your products, ok to pay in advance, even before the products exist, is not a good idea IMO. 
I may understand - forgive? Jerry. Especially if I get my money back :slight_smile:  The case of Kevin is different. Still taking many orders and announcing 30d delays when backlog already accumulated is not the result of unexpected difficulties or mistakes in decisions.

i do agree that it’s hard to run a business but if he struggles with contacting people about updates on very expensive products you need to reorganize. look at mboards. they had no updates and terrible shipping, but they are now reorganizing and changing their structure. now ur probs gonna say they’re parts aren’t high quality and made by them, but this example still holds. i think it’s hard to run a business and i’m not saying it’s not, but many other small business on the forum update their customers.

This is so stupid. He told me money is being used to produce the cheaper EXO board complete board in China. He wanted to concentrate on that before getting back to the drives and boards that are owed. I'm fine with that "explanation" even though it's not being done in the right order. BUT how the heck is he supposed to be able to sell these cheap boards if the brand he's built up for years is being burned down? This makes zero sense. I really have no idea how or why it is so hard for him to communicate. I generally believe most people are more understanding and sympathetic to small start ups as long as there's transparency.

koowheel did a lot of things right, including their motor/esc combo. Yeah its "lower performance" and the housings were flakey, but it was basically bullet proof from a reliability standpoint. The ESC is water proof, the motors aren't that fast but they're torquey as shit and provided a smooth experience.  bolting a cog on them seemed like a no-brainer when i saw it done. 

i have both an exo and the koowheel it was based on. a couple years ago i bought three koowheels for research purposes and i still have one that i occasionally like to ride. The other two were destroyed by their respective riders who destroyed everything else i gave them too. Very valuable people, those destroyers. Lots of good info gleaned from their destruction.

Cool I’ll take it to court with me. I have a bunch of other documents from other buyers. One poor bastard in Canada has been waiting years for a V3.

I have met Jerry on several occasions. One time he even told me that he decided to put the indiegogo buyers ahead of everyone else despite order number because they “complain more”.


Just want the other sellers to know that I tried everything before resulting to this. All I want is a refund for the XL that was never sent and the SD I have to be fixed. I know that a lot of you know Jerry personally and I probably look like an asshole going to court. Just know that I really didn’t want to have to do any of this I always try to be fair in my purchases.

He clearly does not care about anyone else anymore, and i wouldnt be surprised if at this point he just focuses on the china boards hes building and gives everyone previous, the finger. As he already has your money, youll have to fight,claw,kick, scratch, and bite to get it back from him. And he knows it.. and he knows most wont or cant. Hes a pos in my book now.

I’m not completely sure if these are related, but I might as well say it. If it’s taken down then I’m guessing it would be for off topic a little bit. Anyways, a couple years ago there was a drone company called lily. They had this drone that unfolded and was years ahead of its time. The owner of the company did what jerry is pretty much doing but with even more money (34mil) right now and ended up getting raided by the cops and San Francisco’s City filed lawsuits against lily. After that it goes dark and I remember something about possible jail time... So jerry better be getting his stuff together or this could come crashing down harder then he thinks.
