Looking to put my spot welder in a storage container. Found a few containers online but looking for recommendations. I am not talking about it’s 3d printed case. I’m looking for suggestions on something like a pelican case. I’m sure someone is storing their welder in a foam lined case?

There are models you can download on the malectrics site if you'd like to print your own.

No I’m looking for a case to put the built spot welder in for storage. Something like a water tight case. I’m not looking for the 3d printed case.
