Im 200 pounds
and am thinking about slowly buying each of these parts when I can. 

so my question is is there better alternatives to the parts I've chosen and are these parts acceptable for a first build.

Looks pretty good, you might be disappointed with 6s performance on a 149kv motor.  Top speed of 10-12mph with a 200lb rider and will take a while to get there.

It's a little extra, but I'd recommend the following changes:

$?? 8s batteries
$90 190kv sensored 6355 (diyelectricskateboard)
$99 VESC speed controller (diyelectricskateboard)

Would give a 20mph top speed, and smoother faster acceleration for $50-60 more.

yeah but the 6355 would give a lot less torque.  I'd say to go for the turnigy 6374 190kv

If he goes with the VESC i'd probably agree.  You can run FOC unsensored with good results and the motor is $10 cheaper.

Edit: on send thought if you are looking for more torque, higher voltage is a better bet.  12s on a 6355 is insane, but 6s on a 6374 is mediocre...

@jaykup  @Levolt and @Namasaki 
  
For 8s battery 245kv is perfect, it's a beast:) But with 15t motor pulley, 36t wheel puley and 83mm wheels. I'm also 200lb, It goes like a monster, also takes me easy over all bridges I needed so far.

Need more torque: change motor pulley to 14t or 13t, for me I didn't notice a lack of torque even with 15t on motor pulley, when I was going over bridge, just little slower board was, that's it :)

Higher voltage means more torque along with more top speed. 
10s is the sweet spot with 190kv motors 
6355 motors for dual drive 
6374 motor for single drive
Vesc motor controller 
Dual drive is highly recommended for 200 pound rider.

Looks good - the 8s battery has better price, power and range.

3.7v x 3s = 11.1v x 2packs = 22.2v * 5ah = 111 watt hours
3.7v x 8s = 29.6v x 1 pack = 29.6v * 5.8ah = 171 watt hours - 60% increase in range!

The other ESC won't work with 8s.  You won't be disappointed with a VESC!

Motor mount is questionable, but may work.
