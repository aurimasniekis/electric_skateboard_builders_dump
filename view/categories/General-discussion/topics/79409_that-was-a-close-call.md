Just nearly blew my board/ house up.....

I just went to put the cap on my charging port, so far so good... then my wife asked about something and I turned to talk whilst still trying to put the cap on... this is when the metal side of the the cap went far enough into the port to strike an arc off the pins, which because the port faces upwards, melted the pins into a puddle in the bottom so that the arc could keep going! The plasma flame lasted about three seconds and was 3-4” tall... then by some miracle it stopped. 

So, definitely should have put a fuse in the charge side of the battery!!

Everything seems undamaged with the exception of the charge port.. I’ll test charge tomorrow to see if the bms survived.

The problem really stems from the fact that the charger is female meaning the male dangerous part ends up on the battery. A 10A fuse is the fix, plus the sugru.

@Andy87's experience made me start putting fuses on my charge port and this just doubles me down.  

Everyone, can we please [order these 7.5A 58V fuses](https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/576-099707.5WXN) and put them on your charge ports?  I think ***every*** new build should have this.  And those of us that have extra could toss a few in the free stuff thread.

About a month ago I made a mistake while creating a cable to connect the switch to the battery and and I switched polarities. I burned an ESC and I was luck that nothing else worse happened. The switch melted and that stopped the current flow.

I don't know why I didn't verify the connections and correct polarity, I always have been careful about this but not this time. Now I'm on the market for a new switch, ESC and battery since it was alrady in bad condition. For  now I will push a regular longboard. :slight_smile:

Probably obvious but just in case... Put the fuse on the board side, not the charger. You want to break the circuit inside the board in case pins fuse shut on the board and all hell brakes loose. Really glad you're ok @amazingdave!

See. I wish it was still obvious, but I'm still learning all this, including what it means to break a circuit.  Im guessing i attach it on one of the two wires inside the board coming from the charger, so that it "blows" when an issue arises so the battery circuit is no longer connected?

[quote="b264, post:110, topic:204"]
I’ve thought a lot about this, and everyone differs, but me personally, if the board starts severely malfunctioning while I’m at-speed in heavy traffic, I would prefer the battery stay connected as long as possible so I still might have brakes to stop while the board is burning-down. If you’d prefer the loop key fuse-out to possibly save your expensive electronics instead, that’s personal preference but I’d rather have the extra couple seconds of throttle response myself. Once it fuses, you’ve got no brakes.

Basically it’s
ME &gt; BOARD
or
BOARD &gt; ME

I prefer to give the benefit of the doubt to myself over the safety of the board/battery itself.

I'm not electronic savy.... but are you sure putting your charging port over the metal mounting plate has nothing to do with it? Shit looks like an arc conducting-tesla coil-hut burning-transformer circuit !!

Meh... 
If you are having the fuse blow then there is something already much worse happening.
The times I've had fuses blow in my power systems, the BMS or ESC is already on fire and malfunctioning. The fuse only prevents a short through your system to reach the battery and make more things catch on fire (The fire on your ESC/BMS might still propagate to the battery but it'll be much slower).

If you are at speed and a discharge fuse rated appropriately for the board blows. Your ESC should already be a piece of flaming toast and you should have already bailed, if not, may the force be with you...

Failure order should be
ESC/Switch/Charger
BMS
Fuse
Battery

This means that your BMS should be able to handle more current than your ESC. Your fuse should be able to handle more current than your BMS and your battery should handle more current than your fuse (maximum for an 18650 30Q cell is about 80A, I've tested this).

I shorted the charging pins on one of my builds once but because I have my Bestech bms wired for discharge, the bms sensed the short and cut power instantly.
It was just a quick arc and off.
No damage to batteries or electronics.

Just checking my groups after one full charge  cycle. 

My lowest group is 4.17 highest is 4.21. This seems a bit off for a bestech. maybe I didn’t leave it at float for long enough?

Thoughts?

My port sparks a little when I plug my charger in, would a fuse mitigate this?  Or is there some thing I'm doing wrong like plugging my port in before plugging in the charger to the wall outlet ?

Sounds more like it's related to your specific charger.  Have you tried a different style charger?  A fuse would not mitigate that.  Which specific charger are you using?

Are you sure you've used all 5.5mm x 2.1mm barrely plugs and that none are 5.5mm x 2.5mm by mistake?

Typically you do want the charger hooked up to the wall but not in charging mode yet when connecting the battery after you connect the battery you should select the charge option... basically sparks like this happen because of capacitors in the device you're plugging the battery into getting filled with the charge from the battery (high inrush current causing the spark, usually happens when hooking batteries to the VESC though not to a charger).  I have seen some small sparks on my own charger though too I don't think it's something to be really to concerned about but if it is unnerving you can always use a "antispark" connector that includes a resistor inline when you first plug the antispark plug in the current is slowed by the resistor so there isn't a high current/energy spark.

I bought the 11s3p battery and assigned charger from build kit boards, paired together by Jared.  So it has a charge only bms I'm sure, but past that I know little.  The barrel plugs seem to be the right size 

@wafflejock hmm I didn't see my charger have a "charge" option switch, I'll check it out when I get home.  It's definitely a small spark, but no spark is best I thought so I needed to ask.  Is the xt90 the best for this situation?  I don't know of anything else I could use.   Or should I buy a certsin resistor and solder it in line?

Gotcha yah I was thinking of the 'balance charger' or hobby lipo charger style charger since it's what I use (no BMS and lipos) but not sure why it would happen with a regular laptop power brick like that perhaps there something more than just a couple of coils in those as you'd have in a regular transformer.
