Hey Guys!
Sorry for the quick question, but is this deck to flexxy for an e-board?
It's for sale for 1/3 of retail on a second hand site hence why i'm considering it.

70kg, thanks :smile:

I know it's within the specs for the board but not sure if it's still ok for an eboard.

If you want to do a boosted style board with the separate enclosures, I assume it would be fine.
