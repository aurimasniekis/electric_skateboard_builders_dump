While it's illegal here, what is your actual experience? I very rarely see police here in Aalborg, however the thing I worry about is that I don't really see any skateboards/longboards (except for skatepark) so I would quite stand out on bicycle paths.

I often ride in Odense, and I haven't been stopped yet. Everyone gives you looks, I even rode past many police cars, and they will surely look at you, but they have other stuff to do than stop a longboarder... :)

Been riding my boards for a good few weeks now, in a Aarhus

Holstebro, and Randers.

Police has stopped me a few times, no tickets so far only got asked what i wrote and how fast it was.

So id asume its pretty safe to drive around in Denmark.

Danemarks seems ideal because of all your bike lanes especially in Copenhagen

besides from the fact that it rains 60% of the time so, if you want to ride more than 2-3 days a week you have to seal your board completely. But yeah it's pretty awesome here, now that it's almost completely legal. Here is a picture of my communte to work.

Nope, not at all. Me and a friend often ride in Odense C and there's no problems. There's too wet here right now though, so I haven't been riding as much. I ride whenever I get the chance!

Hi everyone, I am in Aalborg (Denmark), I know this might be late but only found this post today. I have been looking into eSkateboards but have not found anyone here to talk to, or ride with then today I saw a guy flying up Hobrovej on definately an eSk8. Unfortunately I did not have the chance to stop him.

I would really like to catch up and talk with anyone in Aalborg riding a eSk8 board.
I have a little kite shop on Hobrovej 93, called Kiteworld, stop by for a coffee/tea/water.
