Folks apparently I have successfully dyed my Hub motor longboard wheels into darker color. Initially I would like to achieve black color from the blue color, I end up with almost black dark blue. Sadly it's not black, but this dark is good enough.

So heres the process:
Buy RIT Dye brand <-- all purpose dye, I tried with Dylon brand for clothing it doesn't work. I'll try with Dylon multipurpose soon. Heat up water to almost boiling point (try this first) and add the dye. Stir well for 1 minute. Then add the wheels!

You can have the wheels touching the bottom of the pan, however it's best not to have them in direct contact with the heat.

This process takes about 1 hour - 3 hours of constant heating with stirring the dye.
Here you can see the result.

Before left picture, After right picture (NOTE: These are the same wheels, but I sanded down the right one to achieve matt color).

There you can see that I also tried with my balance lead plastic, they turned black after 10 minutes lol.
I tried also with XT60 yellow plastic, all turns black very quickly!

And here is the after math, 1 matt and 1 glossy dark blue :smiley:

As you can see this maintains the colors, the durometer and the glossy / matt texture of the wheels. They are dyed deep enough that scratching them doesn't alter the color. Thats the reason why it takes hell long to dye them.

NOTE: please be careful when heating longboard wheels in the pan, make sure you are always there the whole time to avoid wheels melting and other causes. The process takes time, it really does to make sure to be prepared! Also this method doesn't always work with all longboard wheels, I tried them with my front wheels (90mm blue wheels with plastic core), after 4 hours they barely gets darker. So it doesn't always work!

Here is the example for the XT60 connectors.

I wonder if the dying process will affect the material properties of the wheels or connectors...

Material properties, not quite sure. But connectors doesn't get dyed at all. Dye doesnt stick / penetrate metal.

XT60 consist of plastic parts and metal parts. When you take them off from the dye, the metal stay shiny while the plastic is completely black. Dying is not adding layers of colors, but the colors are being absorbed by the materials.

I guess I phrased it wrong, I was talking about the plastic part of the connectors. I just wonder if the dye will make it slightly conductive, brittle, etc.

I dont think the dye will do that, but overheating the plastic / rubber can change its properties, thats why its important not to overheat / cook the water with your parts in them! I'll be trying the dye out soon on my orange wheels and the plastic case of my Nyko Kama.

I want to dye the Abec 11 97mm Flywheels. Do you think the black would work or would it just make it a dark green? I'm also afraid of the plastic in the hub melting.

I think it will be dark green. Best achieved with the purple kegel. But dont bother dying when now there are alot of vendor selling black 80mm wheels. Back then it was non existent.

Yes indeed 93 - 97mm in black is hard to find, almost non existent. I was searching for it too.
However it's not so important as you can still use the the 83mm wheel with slightly added riser. The height difference is not so significant after all.

I have a set of 97mm Flywheels and some black RIT dye. I'll let you know how it turns out. I'll be using a sous vide machine, so temperature will not be an issue, I know that for sure.

The plan is to try to keep the orange plastic while dying the thane black. Will do some experimenting.

So I've got around to dying my Flywheels and abandoned the idea of keeping the core orange as it was too much of a pain in the ass to do. 
So I used black RIT powdered dye and placed the wheels in 150 degree water with white vinegar to help with dye absorption (according to RIT) and the result was sub-optimal at best. I let it soak for 48 hours and the result was the cores turning brown and the urethane itself a darker green.
I know RIT changed their formula back in the day, and the original formula now resides in their pro line, which I heard dyes plastic really well. I may do that in the future as their new formula isn't very effective at least for Flywheels and Orangatangs from a different post.

There's a black Evolve Flywheel for comparison.

So update: I went to the local fabric shop and bought me some iDye Poly, which is specifically for synthetic materials, and it turned out much better.
Now the flywheels are as black as ball point pen black, but you can only tell if you're comparing it with something blacker (like the Evolve wheels).

I used White Vinegar, but I think this stuff is pretty potent so you probably won't need it. But make sure that you boil the dye to get it all mixed and then let it cool before placing the wheels in. I noticed that I had extra ink particles at the bottom and they can smudge onto anything and it's hard to wash off that extra ink.

On another note, I hit a gnarly jagged rock and chunked a small piece off a wheel :( the dye soaked in about 3 mm deep before some dark green started to show with only 45 minutes of dying time. Unfortunate, but for science I guess...

With the iDye you only soaked the wheels for 45 minutes vs 48hrs with the Rit?
```

## \#27 Posted by: Aeroquiv Posted at: 2017-03-28T00:36:07.348Z Reads: 233

Yea it just means that the Rit formula was not meant for polyurethane, and no amount of soaking would have worked. Rit's Pro-line is probably a similar formula to iDye's and would have done the same thing with 45 minutes. You can dye for longer if you mix the dye correctly. I removed it earlier since I was getting excess dye particles on the wheel that I had to clean off.

Thanks for your help man. iDye Poly worked really well. The boiling processes was pretty stinky - smelled like vinegar + ballpoint pen ink.

I did my 97's the other day.

Bought i-dye poly from the fabric store. $3 ?

Put all the wheels in an old frying pan and added water to cover them about 1/2".

Took them out and boiled the water, then added the color enhancer, and then the dye packet (dissolves in water)

After stirring and simmering for about 3 minutes, i turned the heat off.

I waited about 2 minutes before putting them in, logo side up, and then put a lid on them. 

3 hours later, I plucked them out and rinsed them off in hot water while rubbing them with a rag.

Edit: 
I only did one set..

I only waited a couple minutes after turning the gas stove off.
I just didn't want the hot pan to mess up the back side of the wheels.

I figured ~200° was fine for the urethane and the core. Google told me the max working temp for polyurethane is 175°F.  It probably dropped to that shortly after putting the room temperature wheels in the pan.

Is the color enhancer included in the idye poly or did you buy it separately?
If it's not included, do you think it's necessary to get?

It comes with it in the box.  It's a liquid in a packet.

The dye is a pod, drop it in and it dissolves in the water.

You probably don't need the vinegar. But you can use it as contingency if, for some reason, the wheel isn't taking the dye 30-45 minutes in. 

You have a couple options, either using some object such as wood or a metal grate as a buffer or a piece of wire hung over a bar. Remember, whatever you put in, you're probably not going to use that thing for any sanitary purposes. 

Another simple option would be to boil the dye with whatever maximum water iDye tells you to use so that the high volume of water would retain heat long enough to dye. Take it off the heat and then heat sink the hot ass pot to your counter or something. Let it cool enough, so that when you yolo dunk the wheels in, it won't melt from contact with said pot. You then stir the wheels just in case.

Did you do them yet? 

I put my wheels straight in the pan with the inside edge down. No issues.

I put them in there and added cold water untill it was 1/2" over the top, then pulled the wheels out and boiled the water. 

A min or two simmering with the dye, then I turned the gas off...3 min later I forked the wheels in, stirred occasionally, and left them in until cold.

Never dyed my wheels. But seeing that you have to have the water not boiling when you dye, would it be possible to use a cheap 5 gallon bucket? Boil the water, pour it into the bucket with dye. Drop in wheels. Would that work?  Use two buckets to insulate if you want the water to remain hot longer

Hey guys I'd bought the dye over a year ago but never got around to dying my wheels. Today I did and it turned out amazing.

I'd already rubbed the text off the flywheels using a metal wire brush long ago btw.
I heated the water to almost boiling, added the dye, and then put the wheels in. I bought a second hand buffet type food thing which was perfect to be able to place a flame under. Kept it on low flame for about 1.5h, then I had to leave the house so I turned off the flame and let it cool down slowly for about 2.5h. Came back, took them out, rinsed them, and this is the result!

Really impressed! They're blacker than I expected them to get and they look great! Excited to see them on my board.

There's color differences because they weren't 100% dry yet, but you get the idea.
