@MoeStooge I'm still for the 120mm wheels! Those 63mm are very appealing to me (I'm more of a wide contact patch guy) but the 30% range reduction is a lot :thinking:. 50mm are more all around, no? 63mm are gripier? ...aaaah but the price! :roll_eyes: 

I'm still thinking, still thinking (this decision is driving me nuts already :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye: )

Cheers Bro.

That's probably a concern for "real" eskaters and commuters, not casuals like me haha. 

The nearest pub is about 3 minutes away on my board and after that they are spaced in intervals of about 3 minutes from each other. My rides are pretty short and only ever recreational.

With that said.. aside from increased wear due to higher rpm I cant really see why they would be considered "unreliable"?

The 120 x 50mm 70a Street wheel for all time cruising and fantastic grip. Roll resistance falls between pnumatics and PU wheels. Race wheel 50a front 45a rear is 13mm wider and  has stuck down no slide grip for track racing but reduces range due to high roll resistance. 
I'm working on getting production set-up. The wheels are 250.us per set. At the moment I'm working out production details with a machinist for the hubs and don't have a price negotiated. Hubs will come with 42t and optional 60t pulley. Hubs will also have spur gear option.  I expect 90 to 125.us for a hub set. Wheels attach to hub like a car. Wear longevity is fantastic, been on my OG race wheel set for over a year.  Street wheel road tested 63mph. ![9E4AC5CB-ACF3-4BA4-8947-2E2DF7767B8F|690x459](upload://bajrWl4JXBsHlC0k7kZmRbpV1Kr.jpeg)

Hi Aurimas,

If your 6" hubs fit psychotiller's tires they should also fit the haggyboard tires (i'm pretty sure the rim is the same size) and should also fit the 5" alibaba tires.  It's just a matter of finding a tube for the 5" tyres.

So there may be no need to create a new wheel as the 5" is just a lower profile tire.

I believe 5" tires are way too small to be effective. That's why you don't see much. It was highly advised not to run 5" tires so I ended up settling on 6.3" tires. If you also run 5" tires they are only good for 5" tires while a slightly bigger tire you can always use the same rim to run a 7" or 8" tire.

...the argument that is a rim they don't have (neither other manufacturers). So if they don't have a rim for such a tire, then is not very convenient to promote such a tire, right? :sunglasses:

Some of the arguments are that a small tire will 'wear down faster' than a larger tire. But the again ... shouldn't the manufacturers feel happy because they are now feeding the market with new 5 inch tires more often (??)

Skaters love narrow trucks. They are becoming shorter by the year. Whilst Eskaters love wider trucks and bigger wheels despite the fact that we don't require them by any measure. If we are right or not...the market is more than happy to provide Eskaters with wider truck and larger wheels, no?

@LukePL can't remember the exact details but was something similar to what i mentioned above.

I think it's safe to say.. if Evolve tried 5" but ultimately went away from it.. I'd imagine it's for good reason.

Ultimately, I didn't bother with a 5" because I plan on releasing a 7" or 8" makes sense to use the same rim.

@LukePL, I got an idea.... perhaps we are looking in the wrong place for these 5 inch tire! We only need a 5 inch tire with 8mm bearing in the middle, right?

Why don't we knock on the door of these guys (scooter manufacturers) instead?? They already using the wheel size we want!

In those scooters they are using solid wheels :(
@mmaner do you use them? For sure they wobble right?

@pixelsilva and @LukePL I have spoken to them about the tyre already, which is why they arent responding to you guys more than likely.

They don't have the mould for that tyre anymore and are not prepared to reproduce it for any less than 2000 wheels. I had originally paid for 40 test tyres and shipping through a contact in China but when the order was relayed to the factory floor they declined it because they could not find the mould.

Edit: There is a second supplier directly on Alibaba, I spoke to them for a month but in the end:

Thanks a lot for info! They could just wrote that or even put this 2000 MOQ in Alibaba. 
I have also contacted other factories but all of them want to make big tires because there are the money.
I really want a small tire and some DD. I'm afraid that 6 inch is to big.

Quite honestly there's so little difference between 6 and 5 when you're above the trucks, it was more just to see if it could be done for me.

But they won't accept the order even if you have 2000 I think, the mould is gone, I doubt they will make it again.

I absolutely scoured the internet for another source and then my friend in China made a bunch of calls, in the end I gave up last week.

His face is just so awful. I'd punch his nipples clean off and then keep them in a jar in the freezer, in 4 years time I'd visit him unannounced and show him his own perfectly preserved nipples just so that he could feel the pain all over again.

I recognize that pulley setup! If you guys are interested, I found it on Alibaba.

Seems pretty cheap from their other postings, but I can't tell exactly what this one costs. I submitted an inquiry.
