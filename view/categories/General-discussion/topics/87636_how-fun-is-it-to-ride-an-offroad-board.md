I hope to try it some day but I feel like I need a street build first since an offroad would be cumbersome to communte with.... looks like a blast wish I could try it out, would love to blast by people riding off paved paths like a mad man

sad thing is the amount of power they take and how much more expensive

I hate that we have to trade form for function when we bottom mount batteries with a trampa board or any mtb. I really wish someone would work on a perfect solution.

the only reason I would 'rebuild' is if i were to get a kaly deck. I dont think ill ever want to change my setup, as its (imo) only the best

Urban treads + trampa rims ( this is also subject to change, i might go all the way up to 8 inch)

12s7p 30q

Unity

Etoxx 1:4 Helacial 

Maytech surf remote

Urban carve trampa

maytech 170 6374 sealed

like, i dont even know what I would want to upgrade on that board to make it 'better' 

maybe suspension if I dont end up liking it?

The hub cruiser... thats a different story x)

man it totally sucks, I hate flying past trees in beautiful forests without needing to worry about being hit by a car and I really miss the pollution from all the car engines too ;)

I started off with street wheels and didn't think I would be bothered about off-road, now I am totally addicted to hitting the dirt trails near me.

took this a few days ago during a sunny spell between the horrible rain we've had the last week or so

I’m sort of in the same boat as you, when I started with a diyeboard kit. Now I’m working on a trampa 12s8p undermount(will probably top mount if I don’t like it when the cells degrade to new)kaly drive with dual 6374 190kv on 8” with a Hoyt puck. (have a mini etoxx gear as back up and plan on upgrading to helicals if I need to use them). Then I got impatient and started a tayto grocery store short board....

I’m just saying, there’s always something we have to get in this diy world we are in...

Riding offroad is the best thing ever, I'll never forget my first surreal ride. Jumping is beyond words but also can hurt.


![jump1-gif|360x203](upload://e8AuIdxnd93pVQDxDvVhLREOIr3.gif) 

For commuting or AT I like bottom mount enclosure but for MTB top mount and bindings is a must IMO. It is priceless when you don't have to worry about anything plus never have to step off the board within the whole ride. Nothing can stop you

That's the bottom of my MTB (no dust just scratches), couldn't imagine an enclosure there...

![063926|690x388](upload://6PQAN6opIi2C5Pj90YZ9UwP9LvO.jpeg) 

No space below the deck
![still001|690x388](upload://qIARV2MGwuA4zdOfCOzObi8yC5Z.jpeg) 

Yes it's expensive but a mountainboard is a very good reason to be totally broke :laughing:

Bolt kit

15ply 35o HOLYPRO Carve Deck - STIFF
Golden Bronze Stickers

just copied off the invoice, 15ply stiff. It doesnt flex too much when i jump on it while its laying on the floor... but obviously that is going to be different when im riding it

Ill also have a double stack enclosure from eboosted, so even more undercarriage space is even more compromised :P

I honestly don't know.
Deck stiffness also depends very much on preference.
I weigh 170-175lbs and have the 16ply electric deck.
I have yet to decide whether I am happy with it or want a stiffer deck.

I would imagine that 6.5 inch wheels and that level of the flexometer ( really creative frank :joy: ) will lead me with a board that should be able to flex a little but not too much... I just worry ill take one hard hit too many and spill my batteries all over the concrete :sob:

## \#42 Posted by: taz Posted at: 2019-03-19T18:56:48.422Z Reads: 166

I would expect an underdeck enclosure to slightly stiffen the deck.

When I ride on road at high speed and I hit a road bump, the deck compresses and this causes some instability. My Evo on the other hand which is really stiff is a lot more stable. I am talking about deck induced instability so let's not bring the differences in the trucks into the discussion.

Off road though it feels fine since I don't go full speed with all the rocks and trees around me. However I don't have enough kms on it give a valuable opinion.

I don't hear people complain about it so it may just be a personal thing with me but I don't like it. I generally move around quite a bit on my decks as I ride so I don't like bindings either but maybe they do help in this case.

Do you mean without mounted trucks? 

This is the firm 14ply carver deck :laughing: and I'm 74kg/163lbs

![vlcsnap-2018-10-24-00h09m24s291|690x388](upload://nHjeFg77nyJMlYesIE4VWcfkWVd.jpeg) 

But while riding I don't jump in the middle of the deck so no problem. There is a reason why it's called carver and not speed demon. I wouldn't worry too much with a fiberglass enclosure like eboosted about hits.

BTW my MTB deck is 16ply.

[quote="Battosaii, post:46, topic:87636"]

[/quote]

This only happens when the deck is too stiff according to weight. My 14ply carver is totally flat and the 16ply MTB almost flat when I stand on it. If people like stiff decks then Trampa is probably the wrong choice and leads to the bowed out stance if choosing the stiffest deck without being a heavy guy.

Even with fg I would piss in my pans going off road. There is so much more which can damage the enclosure. Even if it will not fully destroy the enclosures but just imagine sliding over a sharp rock or piece of wood...
Latest after I crashed against a piece of wood sticking out of the ground with 20km/h i‘m super happy that i decide against a underboard tray.
That collision would probably just rip off the hole enclosure.

I depends on the definition of off road. With bottom mounted enclosure it's possible to ride on all terrains like grass, gravel, dirt or whatever but of course I wouldn't ride in heavy and bumpy terrain. Well I did ride in skate park and scraped my Trampa tray but it's sturdy, I could slide on it (but don't try it). Real off road (in my definition) needs top mounted enclosure(s).

Haha don't worry, with a carver deck you have with 7" more ground clearance than with 8" on MTB. Also this was a hardcore flex test and has nothing to do with riding in real life. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Qx7iVv4gQI

Even with 125mm Gummies I don't have problems with ground clearance (height of enclosure with gasket about 26-27mm) so I don't see a problem with pneumatics and double stack enclosure for all terrain.

Ok then I guess the enclosure was not flexible enough. I've heard e.g. when a Trampa tray has slices on the sides only it kills the flex and the deck gets stiff, maybe this was the case.

With segmented enclosures there should be almost no impact in flex especially when the mounting holes on the enclosure are slightly bigger than the bolts plus gasket and rubber washers. Of course there must be enough segments or a tray cut like this:

For me it’s a no brainier 

Most routes I have taken that are long are when I do multiple loops of the same forest or path and so the other batteries are in the car (don’t put them in my backpack). For me there are loads of reason to have a smaller pack. The wieght and the ride feel of the board riding, I can jump, I can also do small jumps to avoid the dreaded tree routes that if you catch them right on the back end will spin the board in a second, very tight cornering is easy with a little jump, so many times I was going to fall and a small jump reset me centre of gravity and so didn’t fall, I just don’t end up doing 60km runs, more manageable to replace a dead cell or bring back into balance, looks better on the board, cheaper, it would be a smaller firework, etc etc

On the plus side you can boast that your board has a 12s10p and 60km range and erm, erm well I suppose you could enjoy an uninterrupted 60km ride.

I actually have less fatigue with bindings on tramp deck. 
I find one of the problem was my foot sliding in my shoe because of the chamber.
Bindings just holds everything in place.... 
Even a foot stop help make things better.

The chamber also creates pressure points on the inner side of your foot even if its flattened out by your weight.

One of the reason why I am really excited to try out the new MBS decks.  
Hopefully it will make the pain go away.

Interesting... I bought the trampa deck above and I'm really worried that the camber horizontally across the board is going to mess with my stance... So I might need to whip out the epoxy and 3d print some camber like the gents here have done

That should get about 85+ km, if youre good with the throttle maybe 90 :P 

Thats a little too long though. I feel like thats where the samsung 40T comes in to save space and p count. less to go wrong with the system.

Yes, this is with 8inch wheels off road. I comfortably get 15miles per pack of off road riding on mountain bike routes. So what’s that 24km per pack. 

Urethane range isn’t really in the equation for me as I have a mountainboard. 

All I’m saying is, that for me, after owning the board for a good while, there is no way I would put a huge pack on my board. Not to say I am right, but that is not what I would do, personally.

When I have a house maybe ill have a little insulated shed outside for my lipos so I can have a board like that :) 

I dont want to get into the what is safer question and debate, but I feel safer with liion with a diebiems, than iI would with a lipo as I live in a dorm room. Burning it down due to me being an idiot connecting wires isnt an option :P

Soooo boring. But I'm only on a Backfire Ranger X1 which seriously lacks power for someone my size. That being said, on a recent ride along a bike path I saw a sign that said [unpaved roads, bicycles not recommended] and I just turned in and rode through the dirt and gravel path. It's the little things that count.

Any of you guys using binding snowboarders? I don't currently have bindings on my Trampa and I'm a bit worried about going down that route.
When snowboarding you tend to keep on one edge and putting bindings on the board will make it feel even more like snowboarding but you need to stay flat footed.

I've been wondering this exact question, mostly because I want to make myself an electric longboard in style and handling, but I need to use mountain-board pneumo tires in order to not judder myself to death on crappy UK roads. 
Simply going straight for a mountain board is option b but I hear it makes life difficult in the turns.

I don’t have much experience snowboarding (only been to the fake snow indoor places). When turning there’s obviously more pressure on my toes/heels when turning but I feel an equal pressure from the healstraps/bindings and feel quite locked it and attached to the board. Less on the edge than a snowboard, I think. Don’t know if any of that makes sense lol hopefully some people with snowboarding experience can chime in

I think it's dangerous. On a snowboard you have no wheels. You ride literally on the floor.
With 8" wheels the stance looks like the perfect way to break the knees.
That's just my personal opinion. I might be wrong.

You run into similar dangers on the slopes, but with softer consequences.
Bindings should help reduce turning circles too.  

Anyone with experience of elastomers over springs? I started on springs but I'm thinking of switching over to elastomers.

Its a completely differemt experience. Riding offroad takes a little bit of getting used to, but if you have 12s and plenty of torque its the most fun thing ever. Shredding grass on a skateboard is a crazy thing to be able to do. MTB vs GoKart.... MTB wins for me.

I would rate the elastomers regarding riding stability something between yellow and red dampas, just with a way smaller turning radius. 
can just recommend them.
Plus let’s add this

Actually using bindings that can let your foot slide out is a lot more dangerous.

There have been many people that have twisted a knee while using bindings without heel straps when one foot slipped out of the binding and the other did not. The most notable being Mr. Benjamin Vedder himself.

According elastomere dampers, what can I say ..... :heart_eyes::smiling_face_with_three_hearts::kissing_heart:

They are sick! They feel stable at speed and give good support like with dampas. But the elastomere can be compressed more than springs therefore the turning radius gets significant better. I haven't tried them without bindings (probably less turning radius but still good and should prevent speed wobbles). Hmmm I need another set. 

In the past I had to jump to get certain corners, now I just take the corners with ease with my mountainlongboard, with bindings and proper lean it looks like this:

![dampers1a-gif|360x203](upload://8UDmEJ2jTUE1UkraotJVLyuiwOk.gif) 

I couldn't imagine to ride with springs again. The only small disadvantage is that when losing balance or landing crooked after a jump the board makes a turn instead of being rather straight with springs and dampas. Also riding downhill fakie is more challenging, at least for people like me who can't ride fakie that good but I try to improve.

Have you ridden the elastometers in cold weather and noticed any change in the damping? 

I've noticed the bushing on my pushy skateboards get noticeably stiffer below 50°F or so.
