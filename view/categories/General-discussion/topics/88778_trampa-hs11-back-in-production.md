@trampa 
Is the HS11 back in production and the Holypro discontinued?

I thought these were the new Holypro35?

That is the electric version of the holypro.
There was also a version without the channel.

We are making new stock next week, decisions are being made at the very moment. Probably we will cut some HP decks in this batch.
