Hi all im wanting to power my new build using dewalt batts.. the 5ah are 5s2p and the flexvolt batts are 5s3p. Plan to run them as a 10s setup.. 

This was how i was originally going to power the board..
Grouping the batts.. 2 in series 2 in paralel.. pretty easy to just use the shipping covers and modify with dremel/exo knife.. but i think i might want something a bit less diy looking and more of a custom one off factory look..

Heres a couple designs which i think would both work well...or even better if there were put together?

First design.. is more like an adapter to capture/harness the power from the batts.. all good to go with 14g wire and a xt60 plug..  https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2435964

The 2nd is a flush fit for the dewalt batt.. it has a section cutout to run the factory dewalt plug/pin out.. i have a couple of these from some old tools/chargers.. but you could easy adapt the two designs to make something which could be used buy others on this forum interested in running modular batt setups? https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1809116

Thoughts?

This could work, just remember that all that plastic casing will take up more room on your board. Here's a guy who did this with Makita batteries:
