just wondered if anyone did glow in the dark urethane wheels, my thoughts being that yes you can get light up wheels but these are prone to failure, if there was a urethane wheel with a glow in the dark compound it could easily be kept glowing brightly using a black light (UV) led

I think the issue would be actually making a 'stable' compound.

A few wheel providers have said no to certain colours because the wheel lacks the qualities it should

or regular wheels with a thin coating on the side with the glow in the dark compound

its not like glow in the dark wheels could be used instead of lights anyways its more of an ethics thing imo
