Hi!

I was checking the Arc Aileron, and I was thinking how I can make a similar drive system. 

What kind of motors are they? Is there any motor I can buy similar to them? Also what kind of gear do they have that fit a tiny 90mm ?

Arc uses 50xx sized motors for their latest direct drive boards (still in production). Not sure their gearing ratio though...

I am working on my own that fits 90mm wheels but having tons of problems getting the helicals to align. Going to resort back to Spurs for now.

Do you lathe-machine your trucks? Maybe that helps with alllignment as everything would be centered and orthogonal.

What’s your motor? I’ve 5055 diyeboard laying around, I might try! What’s the advantage of helicals or better... the problem with spurs?

Answering myself: it seems that helicals runs more smoothly and quietly

Yes but I don't have the machinary to do that precisely enough...

I have actually ridden the Arc prototype gear drive. It's surprisingly quiet for spur drive and much much quieter than my helical drive.

(No affiliation with Arc, just happen to be in the same country as them)

One benefit is I noticed increased efficiency going to gears...

There you go boys knock your selves out :facepunch: 

Hardwork done, will still need some machining to make them work...

https://khkgears.net/new/helical_gears.html

Unless you have cnc tolerances from the truck to the drive gear mount interfaces, forget helical. You can cowboy a spur gear by hand/eye... A helical no...

I'm not a qualified engineer, so routinely ignore my comment on this matter... but with two helical gears, made of steel, for eSk8... with your drive wheel being only maybe 5 x the width with a lot of gear reduction, made or thane... just seems like over kill for you ability to transfer torque/power.

What are CNC trucks? You mean custom trucks?

Anyway I changed back to Spurs... Because the alignment is less sensitive they are actually quieter than my helicals... (Also metal on plastic vs metal on metal).

My plan was to design a geared drive for caliber II and Torqueboard 218mm trucks, why? Because I use both of them and they are very commonly used trucks in the esk8 community.

As such I'm very hesitant to spend any more time and money to invest in another set of trucks, let along custom make some...

As for comparing to the Fatboys, well.... functionally sure they are similar.. build quality wise mine are light years BEHIND... I would love to get me some Fatboy drives but that firstly will cost a fair bit and secondly will take the fun out of building my own.

I am considering releasing the STLs after I do more testting so people can make their own... It's pretty straight forward... Just a matter of how comfortable you are with plastic parts instead of metal.

After a bit of testing I wouldn't mind taking it to the machines! :slight_smile:

The design looks interesting, I haven't really looked into gear drive since people mostly use it for off road builds and thats not for me at the moment.

You have access to a CNC? I been dying to find some place that will help me CNC at very low quantities but without breaking the bank...

Geared drive for on road builds are awesome too... Other than them being louder than belts I cannot think of why I would go back to belts..

Btw, I am making a larger version for my MTB...

Sure, I've already ridden maybe 50km with this version on 90mm flywheels... but I need better prints for higher durability.. Might go with some nylon prints for the motor mount and HP fusion for the gears...

Give me a few more weeks to test everything...

That's awesome. Me and my buddy can likely mill the wheel spur and casing out of hdpe or pom easily.

POM works great for gears. And I'm almost done with a spud/potato build on dual 5045 on calibers. So yea I'll be watching this.. as I just put the Fatboy mini on my Evo with spurs

Not typically. If Yu made your aluminum motor plate/clamp a flat profile that didn't need flipped. It will reduce cost and make it a simple mill.

Yeah it doesn't need to be flipped but will still need that side ways mill for the clamp. Also I can't figure out how to make it symmetrical because space is super tight... I am down to hairs on every side...

The gears need to be flipped though.. there's a bearing that helps to keep it nice and axial around the truck...

I have been admiring about which one of your Drive Systems available.  I have decided on the one above and waiting for it to be finished. My question is regarding the metal on plastic vs metal on metal and looking at the close ups on website to me those plastic gears just don't look that strong and if one was to break that is concerning anyone spending a decent amount of money.  Although, I have been looking for a drive system even when exploring some of the direct drive systems it's tough to get straight answers from the company or they don't really know what they're doing likey lofty (Elofty).  I purchased and item on eBay from them and after paying them they started giving me different stats and different Wheels that would work with their system. the price had gone up right after I cancelled it and they finally returned my money but what a disaster. Anyway, there is a few others who make direct drives but none of them connect to any of the trampa's, Boosted (KEGELS), ABECs (PLEASE CONFIRM THAT THESE WOULD WORK with the new Slick Revolution 110mm 76durometer wheels.. as well. 
Also, these drives will work with the Bergmeisters as well!!   And comes with the 240 big boy hangers and discussing in this post about trucks and using with different trucks is understandable from a consumer standpoint as we all have our own trucks that we think are the best but when having so many wheel options and caliber 2's are still great!!
