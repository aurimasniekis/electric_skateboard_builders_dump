That ^ was exactly what I was hoping for when I clicked hahaha. Second choice would be this

[New AlexTech motor power level over 9000](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=WMbY8yky99g)

Third and ultimately best choice you should have gone with:

Daddiesboardshop are a bunch of assholes. I will never buy from them Muirskate is the best shop. Fast shipping and knowledgeable people. They usually do 15-20% off for Black Friday

Oh wow ouch, what happened with Daddiesboardshop?

I bought from both of them before, once each. Daddiesboardshop missed out part of my order and in the midst of some miscommunication, they not only refunded me the cost, they even ship out the missing part after that.

Also bought from Muirskate during Black Friday last year, like you said crazy good prices, and fast shipping.

I had contacted daddies when I was a noob to skating and told them I had a board that Had a wb of 15 and was 32 inches long. I asked would grizzlies work they said yeah you won‚Äôt have any issues I got the board put together and it was super squirrelly and was wobbling just at pushing speeds.

 I went on silverfish long boarding and everyone said under 20 you usually use tkp and not rkp. I rode with them on literally for about 20 minutes just enough time to go around the block. I called daddies and they said since I used them I couldn‚Äôt return them or they might be defective and to contact bear trucks. Contacted bear and sent that person some pictures of the hanger and everything he said there was not deformities but said that with the size board he would have recommended the polar bears. Called daddies and told them what bear had said and they said nothing we can do because they could be defective and couldn‚Äôt resell them.

They have been pretty consistent with BF sales. I've sent them a whack of emails over the last few months. Questions and orders of multiples of trucks and they haven't responded.

I just don't understand why companies don't want to sell their products. Blows my mind

(A whack of emails is 4 btw. That's 3 too many for my liking though üôÑ)

Sorry for the wait!  

Unfortunately, our official Black Friday / Cyber Monday discounts are only 10%.  
The good news is that it was easy to see you guys deserve better so we've decided to give all members of your your forum an ongoing 15% discount.   Our site can't combine multiple "any order" discount codes so please use the following codes (www.mbs.com):

ESK8BUILD25 - 25% Available for members of this forum from now through Cyber Monday.

ESK8BUILD15 - 15% Available for members of this forum whenever you feel like it (i.e. when the items that have notoriously been out of stock this past year :disappointed_relieved: are finally back in stock :grin:, or when the new items you've requested are released :partying_face:).
```

USA - 
The Matrix II Pro are showing as in stock now but I think the qty is limited.  The regular Matrix II are the ones sold out there (back in stock mid-December).

Europe - 
The opposite of above.

Perhaps I'm being too objective but that money could buy some pretty decent precision set ups.

It's better to buy it with the unity and then sell it back out. $200 for a unity is a steal. What I imagine is @Kug3lis and others will make products that integrated into unity the since it has so many features and port available.

RipTide Sports' thoughts on Black Friday and Cyber Monday.  

The best thing about Black Friday is watching the Walmart bum rush videos, that being said, RipTide does not discount for either event and we ask our retailers to honor our wishes to not discount RipTide products.  Since we started, 8 years ago we have not raised our prices even though inflation marches on.  Everything we make is hand made, here in the USA and that is not cheap to do.  We maintain our pricing for several reasons which include but not limited to supporting our dealer, distributor matrix, events as well as our riders, shop riders and their events.  Our quality is in line with our pricing and we do not want to compromise that relationship and sacrifice it took to get here.  Our commitment to you is to provide the highest quality and performance possible coupled with continuous improvement and R&D to find the next level of performance for eSk8 builders and enthusiasts.

[/quote]

Unfortunately I don't have the kuthaka enclosure developed just yet, I received the deck yesterday night and started the design process today, so it might take a while, maybe a month or more before I have the prototype ready, I'm not even sure how many cells would I make the enclosure for or if I'll work on a SS or DS. 

However, if you are not in a hurry and trust my work, I may consider to add it to the website so you could place the order and take advantage of the Black Friday sale.

well it's $225 vs $259, but then for the $259 you can also choose the blue or red

the basic core seems to be the old model before that change to that blue padding that seems very much like G-Form type stuff and also added the magnetic clasp.

Sure. I'll tell you my Bludgeon build, my daily driver.  

* Surfrodz TKP 177mm
* 90mm axles
* @psychotiller Quick 66 mounts (short plates)
* @psychotiller 6 shooters

The bushing setup is not very traditional, but it fits me well.  I spent weeks trying different combinations of types and durometers, this is what I settled on.

_All bushings are RipTide (@Alphamail) unless noted_
* Boardside Front = Stock SR Hard Barrel
* Streetside Front = 90a Krank Barrel
* Boardside Rear = 97.5a APS Tall Barrel
* Streetside Rear  = 93a Krank Cannon

_* No washers_

So 80-90mm in length but how about the diameter of the axle? They have option between 8mm and 10mm.

When buying 200mm surfrods hangers you need at least the 80 mm axles to fit two 6374 motors correct?

Yeah but like most things it's worldwide now.  I'm not too bothered but I'm just a little disappointed with 10% off etc.

I honestly think the best black Friday deal is the Enertion hub motor and unity deal but fuck the drama that will come from that.  If the shipping at Enertion wasn't so outrageous I would buy a few small things from them (really want a 42V 4A charger)

Cool, I'm seeing some shady stuff from WowGo from Reddit and FaceBook...  I'll admit, I fell for their "enthusiastic" marketing, but I'm a happy customer.  

I'm not here to judge, and thanks for sharing some evidence (but nothing showing fake accounts here, yet)

I didn't give them my repeat business on Black Friday, though I was tempted.  That new remote seems cool, but I'll just stick with what I got.  

I'm a real WowGo customer, and haven't had any misfortunes with their product or brand thus far.  I hope they're not making fake accounts and being shady, for their own sake.

You want evidence? You can have it. Next time that Wowgo pays someone to make an account and post the same message that I‚Äôve been IP banning those accounts for, I‚Äôll leave it there and notify you. I‚Äôm sure it won‚Äôt take long for them to do it.

Awesome.  I accept they have shady business ethics, and I didn't have any idea when I bought mine two months ago.  

They did offer me money, as a matter of fact, like $3, to post a review, tag them, and jump through hoops, but I didn't think much of it and just deleted that email.  I didn't think that was too shady, but I guess technically it is buying reviews. 

I still haven't had any issues with mine and I do love it, be that as it may.  I didn't take them up on their $3 offer though, because I couldn't be bothered with it.
