Hi im thinking of getting abec 11 black refly wheels 97mm, i was told they provide better absorbing than the mbs all terrain wheels,
I wanted to know if the pulleys here:

Will also fit the refly wheels and not only the flywheels, thanks!

Yep.
The 97mm abec 11s are great too.  Im not a fan of those mbs wheels.

Those pulleys should fit. Used to use those all the time in PETG or ABS on my Abec11 97’s and 107’s. Now I use press fit pulleys printed out of Nylon.

Yes but which 97's do you have?
Refly or flywheels?
I want to get the refly, but the pulleys are designed for the flywheels

The hubs on both wheels are identical except for the color.
