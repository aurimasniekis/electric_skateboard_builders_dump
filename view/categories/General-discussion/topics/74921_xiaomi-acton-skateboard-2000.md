hahaha, that's crazy expensive. Motors will break quickly (they've been having this issue for years and they won't listen to me... Motors are too small... But they won't listen). Their kickstarter was a mess because they shipped out garbage from what I heard.

If that’s the one I rode it was an aluminum block. It feels like ur riding an aluminum block. If u buy it for 2000$ a psychological phenomena occurs and you think it’s great though, but it’s not.
