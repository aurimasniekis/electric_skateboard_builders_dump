I noticed that the Flipsky VESC https://flipsky.net/products/torque-esc-vesc-%C2%AE-bldc-electronic-speed-controller?variant=8712049918012&currency=USD&gclid=CjwKCAjw5fzrBRASEiwAD2OSV3Oc0aZ5wu31HWo2Leqs_ccn5e76gUFzlbIDAWhPEVfE21xAo23iJRoCEFoQAvD_BwE and the HGLRC VESC https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07GFB55NV/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 looks exactly the same. Are them? If not, which one is more reliable?

yaaa, just received 2 of these:
https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000125493181.html?spm=a2g0o.productlist.0.0.3665540ayxnYEh&algo_pvid=ddce29c2-d946-465f-97b6-b683ca7cedc3&algo_expid=ddce29c2-d946-465f-97b6-b683ca7cedc3-0&btsid=702bd133-e008-4703-9a8a-1f5cce8d1c5d&ws_ab_test=searchweb0_0,searchweb201602_3,searchweb201603_53

for $45/piece. Only been on the board a few miles, but it's pushing two 170kw 5065s @ 10S - 35A and FOC without fault for the moment.

I got the VESC. One question is: Should I cut the plastic wrap around the VESC? If I do not, I can not plug in my USB. But after I did, the two big capacitors almost fall off. Did I make a mistake?

When I tried to order it, it said "The product can not be shipped to your area". Why? I live in California.

You can protect the capacitors by splooging them onto the board with hot glue.
