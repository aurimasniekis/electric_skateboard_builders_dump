A loose urethane sleeve or bad bearing would be my guess. Do you feel more resistance or a funny sound when turning the wheel slowly by hand?

If you‚Äôre going to try to open them up, you‚Äôll want to use a heat gun because they have a loctite that‚Äôs tough. If you use regular tools, you‚Äôll mess up the screw t

I don‚Äôt hear anything turning it slowly by hand and they feel the same resistance wise. It also seems fine when I run the motors while holding the board off the ground, sound only happens when I put weight on them.

I also just noticed that one of the plastic covers had come loose and the screws weren‚Äôt all the way tightened - so I tightened them but the noise is still there.

You sure it isn‚Äôt your enclosure being loose or your hardware?

Yeah because when I slowly roll the wheels while sitting on the board it still makes the knocking sound

Update: it‚Äôs only one motor and I can hear it when I spin it by hand fast but not slow. Any ideas? I took the cover off, but I‚Äôm not sure how to get it entirely apart.

I have a used set of these hub motors if you need to replace it.

I think it‚Äôs the sleeve, any way to fix it being loose besides replacing it?

Broken magnet? Have you taken the urethane sleeve off yet? That is the best way to solve your issue

Yeah I can‚Äôt figure out how to get it off. It doesn‚Äôt seem like it wants to budge after removing the plate cover and screws.

How did he take that off so easily!? I guess I‚Äôm going to have to get a hammer and tap it off with a flathead screw driver.

oops, I assumed you had the replaceable hub version, for them clicking is a common known problem :) Since its the older variant I also vote for bearings :D
