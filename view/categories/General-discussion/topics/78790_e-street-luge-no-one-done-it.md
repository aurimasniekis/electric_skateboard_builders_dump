I’m still set on finding a luge deck I could mount 6 or 8 hub motors to see what kind of acceleration could happen.  I’ve got motors waiting(not for sale just custys who want to add theirs to the beast to see it) . It seems no one has done it yet.   Don’t want to go for a top speed record, although it doesn’t seem too fast at 115mph if you had the guts, but 0-30 I’d like to see and maybe 0-50 if I got some higher voltage escs.   Really just want to beat Ducati motorcycles from the light. On camera. 3 seconds that would rock

Probably super efficient with so little air drag.  Could be the most efficient vehicle out there at high speed

That French roller guy, who has wheels on his suit, has Okp's electric drive system. It's kinda similar

Jesus christ I can't even imagine going 60mph THAT close to the ground, let alone 112.7! :face_vomiting:

my high ass thoroughly enjoyed that edit.... thanks :rofl:

sounds pretty scary though. I hate the thought of someone 'slinky-ing' if they were to crash into a wall feet first :grimacing:

This an opening scene from Rollerball. Great movie if you like roller derby with guys, motor cycles, weapons and a little metal ball that you throw @ a goal.

:rofl: I haven't thought about that !!

With an mtb trucks and wheels, it should look so fantastic. We are not so far from karting after that, just a steering wheel missing.

I really like the covers for the lipo packs.
wonder out of what they made and if they custom made or somewhere available :thinking:

they're maybe just some 2 x big 6s +16Ah wrapped around ... 

I didn't know they also are some wipe out race

These guys are in my state QLD...I got a TSG off them. 
Not powered as far as I know but looks like they have fun.

 That's me. I live at the bottom of a 3.5 mile hill with a long 8% and nice 9% at the end. On a regular luge 60 mph is normal and smooth as silk. With the hubs it starts to vibrate at 50 mph. Maybe someday I will get my Carvons that I ordered 22 months ago and build one even faster. Also looking into building a belt drive that I can pop off the belts and get a down hill run with 0 resistance.

What starts to vibrate at 50mph? The hubs? :grimacing:

hopefully its just the board...

50mph w raptor hubs? I guess u use higher voltage.  U could balance the motors n I bet wouldn’t vibrate anymore.  Strap a laser to the hanger n keep adding or taking material off until the laser remains a dot on the wall when motors are running on bench.  

Racing a luge sounds dangerous. 

U ever figure what watts are used to ride on a smooth flat road at continuous 50mph?

 It's the hubs, board is solid at 60 mph with normal trucks.

  That's 50 coasting downhill. I wonder if Nextboard balances their hubs? Or it may be the thinner urethane that causes it. The fastest it goes on the flat is 40 mph. 
     Actually I feel WAY safer on a luge than a longboard, I can also stop faster than a car.

Battery location. Catastrophic energy release. Issue?
In other words...Are those batteries really located where they seem to be?
