I couldn't find any other topic that talks about this but I was wondering about using action cameras as a precaution against car hits and otherwise sketchy situations while on an electric skateboard.

Has anyone set something up for this or similar reasoning? Or is this overkill and unnecessary?

Might be good for insurance or proving fault in an accident, but its not gonna be a deterrent.   You get some cool videos though.

Definitely not a deterrent...it'll be completely ineffective for that. Mostly was thinking for insurance or accident situations where some ass will try to blame you for it.

Right now...I'm kind of stuck on actual positioning of the camera, for best capturing footage in case of a hit.

After seeing what happens to cyclists and motorcyclists, it seems like a good idea to at least be prepared. There are some REALLY shitty people out there who are actually trying to hurt other people on the road, especially if they aren't in a car.

THe best footage will come from a helmet mounted cam, but I usually put mine over my front trucks on the deck.

This is a model I made for mounting a GoPro and Blitzu light using the existing truck holes.

Definitely a helmet mount provides the least shakey footage, but at the cost of looking like a dork. Selfie stick is no good for regular riding of course.

I like RAM mounted equipment personally, twinned to a gimble but on my motorbike even with the bike suspension sucking up the mostpart of viration you get shakes pretty unavoidable.

For esk8 I'm going to put a mount on an esk8 with a short RAM extension to clear feet & mount it to the rear truck bolts facing forward and offset a little to the side using the 4" extension.

Since I don't want to pay RAM â‚¬45 for a piece of rubber
https://www.rammount.com/part/RAM-SHOCK-75U

I'll make my own like this
https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/Vibration-Damper-Shock-Absorber-Non-Shock-Ram-Mount-Richter-4-prong-Adapter-/261857936402

If I like it then I'll print out some cheaper parts to put on any board I want, 3D printed parts and threaded bar for strength

https://www.thingiverse.com/search/page:1?q=ram+mount&sa=&dwh=365ac4e7ce0aefc

Thinking about it,using flexible filiment for the ball part would give even more shock absorbsion. A real RAM ball is rubber coated metal which is overkill since whatever was mounted would be obliterated already if that were damaged in any way.

I use one when I'm riding in "downtown traffic". If a driver messes up I normally give them the one finger hand shake "no no" and point at my helmet cam.

But it is not a deterrent in most other situations as most other traffic formations would never see it.

I've got my GoPro chin mounted on my helmet.  Also not the best looking location however I think it gives you a really good video location to represent where your head is looking near eye level.  Plus you have your mouth near the mic.  

Another option is to buy a smaller camera that you could incorporate inside the helmet with just the lens sticking out.

I'm thinking about mounting it horizontally through the riser as opposed to on top of the deck, but it may not be beefy enough.  I may just epoxy a sexnut into the deck so I screw it in and out.

An hour _is_ bad.  That's like one long ride...

But I don't think mine runs for that long, it doesn't seem like it anyway.

I use the Session 4 which lasts about 2 hours at 30FPS. It does get pretty warm when I use it normally, but as a helmet cam it's not bad because of the constant wind from riding.

Cool idea, like a dash cam for an eskate. An option could be to use an OEM reverse camera from a car. They're small and have a wide angle and run on 5-12v. It could be mounted to the nose of a board or on a helmet with a small built in battery pack.

![IMG_4412|500x500](upload://3jqGZCm8X7SkvJLsfBND1CM6VJM.JPG)

Add a small fpv dvr and it'll record to micro sd.

I think you'd have to do a lot of riding to be justifying an action cam for video insurance.

How many miles are you guys putting on your boards?


The main feature of a real dash cam is that it automatically records when it receives power, and it also automatically will write over old footage, so its quite hands off. Many have lots of other features on top that make them well suited for the job.

I would look into a 360* dash cam that you can integrate into your build. The deck itself is really not such a good place for a camera for getting a good view, but with 360 degrees you should be able to get what you need. It just won't be very cinematic footage.

Integrating it into your build allows it to record automatically when your board is powered on, gets rid of battery issues because you can just power it from your board, and is just a lot easier and convenient than mounting up a camera every time you ride.

Session 5 does last I checked, but the older ones no.
Hero 4 and 3 models SHOULD be able to run from an external power source.
Hero 5 models...hell on earth apparently. Would have to remove the internal battery and only run off of the external. And even then, it's a little sketchy cause it can get quite warm.
Hero 6 models...I haven't looked into it yet.

Some people do lots and lots of riding a day on their boards. Some here use them as their primary mode of transportation, so a camera is very much justified, especially in vehicle traffic areas where there is a higher risk.

Problem with most camera products though...is that they can't handle vibrations very well and most people do not want to watch shaky footage.

And last I checked....it is possible for gopros to loop footage, but I think the settings are finnicky and buried in the settings.

I use a runcam pro v2 for quadcopters it does live  SD streaming and HD recording, pretty good for like $90. Another cheapo option from quad community is the Mobius camera (far worse to work with but pretty durable and small) honestly not sure how they are power consumption wise but could do some testing.

https://www.runcam.com

https://www.mobius-actioncam.com

Runcam needs external power no battery included.  Mobius claims 2 hr runtime.

Big enough SD Card though and record in standard def and not a crazy frame rate and can record a huge amount of time.

I might have missed it, but I didn't see anybody talking about the looping feature of the GoPro (which is an old feature, coming from the Hero3).
https://gopro.com/help/articles/Question_Answer/How-Does-Looping-Work
It acts a bit like a dashcam, where it keeps only the x last minutes of filming. Might be pretty handy! It avoids filling up your memory card. However, if you crash or anything, you have to remember to stop recording to keep the crash part of the video and avoid getting it recorded over.

The biggest problem with gopro looping is that it will only loop over the old footage of whatever your are currently recording at the time. It will not overwrite the oldest footage stored on the card. So you still have to go in and delete unnecessary footage at the end of the day.

Too bad this only works with a select few older gopros. Seems kind of nifty.

For vibration, well if you're using a 360 deg lens there really wouldn't be that much. 
But it'd still be pretty useless footage for anything but documenting what's going on around you.
It wouldn't be pretty enough to go back and watch.

There are "Dash cams" designed around motocycles, with all of the features for that, but for helmet mounting.

Honestly it would be a waste to use a go-pro just for this application unless you wanted to have a go-pro anyway.
Its not exactly the best fit for this application, it has a lot of features a dash cam doesn't need, missing few key features any dash cam will have, and its a really expensive brand.

Most people already have a gopro and do not want to have to go out and buy something new if they can already, in some form, use something they already have for that same purpose. That's what I'm trying to get at here.
Most people here are not going to use a gopro JUST as a dash cam...they are going to use it for other things too. It's a matter of keeping things simple and not having a million devices if having a few can serve the same purpose. However, if someone wanted a dedicated dash cam system and didn't have any intention of using it as anything else but a dash cam, then I'd definitely say shell out for a dash cam system because a gopro system would be a waste of money.
