Hey esk8builders, soon I will be finally getting or making my board, but since there are sooo many options I need your opinion! I'm in between a carbon fiber deck or a traditional wooden deck. What are the pros and the cons? Which would you take?

Wood, less chances of shorts it's more easily replaceable as it's 10x cheaper. And it's modifiable!

I have never ridden a carbon fiber board personally but my "vote" would go to wood as well. This is because wood gives you the feeling of a more natural board as well as a bit more comfortable IMO because wood can flex.  Just my 2 cents.

The only things that go in favor of carbon fiber are the look and the strength, but the second one doesn't matter much, since wood is already strong enough to hold our weight. Carbon fiber is useful if you make something like @whitepony's builds, where wood gets weaker because of channels and holes for batteries and electronics, and you can reinforce it with carbon. It's way more expensive though, a full carbon fiber board usually costs at least 300 bucks, while with 100 you can get a great wooden one. If I had 2 boards, I would have one made of wood and the other one of carbon, but the first one would be wood for sure. It also absorbs vibrations way better than full cf boards, except for the custom made ones like @MasterCho's, that allow some flex

I read somewhere on a heli forum that carbon fiber is known to affect RF signals and can cause issues with your remote to receiver connection.
I think Enertion had that issue with their first Raptor that was all carbon and they had to replace the carbon top with a fiberglass top.

Wood is cheaper, more durable, more flex, better vibration dampening and easy to cut and drill. 

I prefer wood, that being said..
I like carbon for being sexy, lighter, can have complex shapes with thin walls and for the mountain boards that have solid carbon layered up, this would be quite durable and water proof, wood will degrade with extensive exposure to moisture. 

My hobby budget does not allow for carbon though. :sob:

Wood rides/feels way better than CF. Carbon picks up every vibration and bump and resonates everything right to your feet and ears. The only pro with CF is it's strength to weight ratio.

I have wood decks and a carbon fiber deck (raptor). CF definitely vibrates more. If you plan on doing rides longer than 10 miles or riding on rough payment, then wood is a better choice. CF is lighter and looks cool, but I'll take wood deck over CF any day.

[/quote]

I would say in most cases no, but if I wanted a fully integrated design that hides the batteries and electronics, or I had to have really good water resistance I might. Vibration dampening is probably a bigger factor for me as some of the roads and paths I ride on are totally sh*t! I like to have as smooth ride as possible. 

I really like the idea of carbon enclosures though on a wood deck.

Noticeable. Put it this way, I always ride the carbon fiber board with running shoes instead of vans or other skate shoes because the running shoes have more cushioning.

Softer wheels will help. I'm running Abec 11 78a, which are softer than the Abec 11 clones, but even then it still vibrates. Depending on your weight and riding style softer bushings will help a bit as well.

Where do you see it saying that the deck is $200? It seems like its trying to be the Evolve board but its not quite as smooth of a transition to the electronics compartment and in general a bit more crude. That being said, if it really is only $200 and its full carbon fiber its a steal - I'd love to get one.

@VikasG i send an quote request. they reply me 200USD for deck only. 
and i not how big of the battery compartment, they only told me can fit 10s3p liion and duo vesc. 

this deck a bit different from evolve gt, this china deck i cant see any compartment screw from above the deck, i think the cover is on the bottom of the deck.

i just ask for the carbon deck pricing from alibaba seller. 

this deck i saw also. Is miami deck. 220USD for single piece. 
the weight only 1kg. :heart_eyes::heart_eyes:
And no need headache about the enclosure~~~ :yum::yum:

I went with CF. at over 200lbs I didn't want to risk flexing a board and cracking the enclosure or damaging cells. 

The cf deck is not comfortable in a long ride. My rear leg starts getting numb at mile 5

If I had the skills to make it pretty I would do what boosted did. But I don't so I just bought one. It's a little to flexy for me. But it's way more comfortable.

Here is a good comparison, at the top is the Raptor 1 & below Raptor 2

**Some reasons we changed.**
1. people like to ride hard & mistreat shit, shit gets banged up yo! wood core is a bit more durable
2. molded carbon is super expensive! going without it & you can spend the money on bigger batteries & tech.
3. creating a water tight seal is better when using a separate case and mounting it onto the deck.
4. if you don't like the deck shape you can take the electronics & mount onto another rig.
5. wood is better at dampening road noise & feels a little bit more natural.

However, I must say, carbon fiber is UBER sexy and makes building an eboard very easy. It always wins in the looks department.

Your right, but since the carbon fiber is stiffer, and the wood can dampen and reduce vibrations, which one is better for high speeds and everyday commuting and more fun for shredding out there?

All things considered, how much of a weight difference is there between wood and CF? 
I'm gearing up for my next build and I'm looking for a stiff but short deck, about 36-38 inches, the lighter the better.
I'm currently riding on a 41 inch 9 ply maple deck. For my first build I'm liking it well enough, but it weighs 2.2 kg so I want to cut down for the next one.
Glad I found this thread, I thought I'd have to open a new one!
