Pick up your board and bash it against a concrete wall wheels-first as hard as you can for 30 minutes. Because that’s **exactly** what happens to it while riding it.

Thank you for that video @dareno , just made my whole day❤️
I would like to submit the following quotes in solemn appreciation of THE LIFE OF BRIAN 
...RIP
[quote="b264, post:9, topic:91311"]
I don’t recommend units with 2 ESCs conjoined together, like this one above. If you have a failure, you have to replace two ESCs instead of one, and less chance of the other side still working after a failure.

I hope the gas prices in the entire country go that high. And higher. Only way to get electric cars on the road. And maybe convince folks to live near their job.

RIP .builders' Brian. :sob:

My favorite posts of his were the ones where he talked about this hobby being his favorite hobby, and just a hobby...nothing more. And how he loved to crazy mom drive the shit out of that soccer van of his. I think he said it got like 4 miles per gallon of black liquid gold, but the way he drove, it really got 2 mpg. I'm trying to find those posts, but I think they may have been deleted already. :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye: :kissing_heart:

This forum sucks. I just come here to see all the bullshit and watch Enertion drown publicly. Bye @b264 and all the others that Jason doesn't like because we're right. ;)

They nailed Alms for an ex-leper 13:58. Very enjoyable if you know what is going on. Think I'm going to queue it up tonite and piss the kids off

All I want is for B264 to be left alone.
If he commits suicide because of an idiot like Jason, I will kill myself too.
Leave him ALONE!

After some careful research it looks like Brian punched a homeless person sleeping in a U-Haul box who rolled over in their sleep.

The fella is lucky he didn't get shot imo
