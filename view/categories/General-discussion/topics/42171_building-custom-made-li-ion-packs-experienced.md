Hey friends

I am an experienced battery maker, make custom spotwelded packs. I use only the highest quality HE2 cells for great performance. They are so good no BMS is required :innocent:. Also use cell holders for extra safety :) 

No charge for you guys :smiley: 

I can build any size pack from 6s2p to 12s7p

Please see photos of my previous work for a customer:

How much do you charge for teaching battery manufacturing methodology and processes?

Is this intended as an autodestruct for boards?

I do not understand?
Blender would break the battery, could be explosion.

Did you hire a professional to make that battery pack? Looks very well done. Clean and 10/10 design!

The cell-level fusing are ingenious; I never thought of doing it different.  Now I see photo it makes all sense

@jamiex 
I'm sorry, but all the posts in your topic are sarcasm. We're used to see very well built packs on this forum, using spot welds and BMS (you can't say you don't need a BMS with multiple cells batteries).
People are concerned by the quality and safety of your battery.

Check that post to see how it's done

EDIT:
ok, that's actually funny

This why you use a BMS. And I'm scared that you left your pack plugged in for a month...

@jamiex 
Building batteries for other people is very serious business.
You would do well to forget about it.
