I mocked up my belt system with a piece of string and is about 328mm.  Should I get a 330 mm belt or a 335mm belt since I have dual idlers.  Also, does anyone know someone who has those in stock that doesn't charge an outrageous amount for shipping?  In the U.S.

I would get 340/345 max if youre going for dual idlers, depending on if theyre made from regular skate bearings or the POM ones with Janux mounts.... or something else entirely

I used vbeltguys when I had my old build

So, I got a 345 cause I thought I could make up the slack with the idlers, but it was too long.  I'm using janux mounts.  I posted because I really don't want to order more belts and find out they're too short or something.

I have dual idlers as well... But whether its 1 or 2 idlers.. I loosen the idlers to their widest point and measure... Your belt should be no smaller than this as the idlers can't be loosened any further... With that number I usually order 5mm up or to the nearest 0 or 5

V-Belt Guys had great prices!  They were having a 25% off on all timing belts and only $6.29 for shipping!
