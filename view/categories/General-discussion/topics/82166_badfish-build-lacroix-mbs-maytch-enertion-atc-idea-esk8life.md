Thank You guys, YES finally this thing will be rolling in a week or so. We plan to put a few more together using mbs decks HELA BATTERIES for them so we will a good selection of (kit) boards for everyone to ride, Comp 90, core 94, colt 90 all with matrix II trucks and rockstar wheels, eboosted HS11 enclosure, all necessary things to go.

It's even better for a visual inspection, You see everything.
This with the D127 we now can set the bms in 2 positions with out changing anything 
For example,![20190123_033531|375x500](upload://hxpOQ7UjKpSPsP7WVwRkn657lvb.jpeg) 
note the bms is just tape down and can be pulled forward of the pack

I like the clear heat shrink üëå
Especially if you use something like cell level fusing it should be the only way to use clear one.
If one fuse triggered you can see that directly without a need to open up everything.

 coincidence I think not

We are also going to build a 10s6p out of the Samsung 50E as a continuation of this thread. we have 3 batteries to build for LA CRIOX decks 1 12s6p pictured above and 2 10s6p Samsung 50E we will chronicle one

Mbs is releasing a new deck in the coming month or so, Dylan Warren Pro II. Could also be an option for you besides the comp and core models.

Do you just use Kapton tape to isolate the groups running on the right hand side?

No, fish paper as well it's just a clear or off white color instead of green![image|423x500](upload://dQF1Wef1o6n5w2L8bbrBrl5kCWb.jpeg)
each group is then capped with adhesive fishpaper before putting everything together.

Not between the left and right side. Between the groups that run up the right side? Looks like plenty of Kapton? It's nice to see different ways people build batteries.

so two layers of tape and a fish paper medium and in some cases when we need to stiffen an area we will use micro sheets of fiberglass

Thank you, 
  Benjamin and I Really saw the battery pack growing to unmanageable sizes with a lot of unnecessary crap. He has really taken things to a simpler approach to building packs that do what they are capable of.
I also like being able to inspect the pack for 1 quality, cell verification (you don't know what's in that black or blue pack) wire paths and connections, its troubleshooters wet dream.

I see now, yes we talked about putting fish paper there as well but during construction, we have each group taped, so 4 layers of protection. it just becomes redundant, in all reality if something compromises the pack in a major way fish paper won't do shit but burn with everything else

Thanks Guys, I will have some final pics up soon. I just got it configured and closed up. We will have it set up on a 72T gear for a moment to test that setup and then we will go to a helical gear drive (E-TOXX), deck finish (top) for the final build. 
PS. e-toxx group buy anyone? 
We will facilitate a small GB starting next week for the helical MATRIX mini drive once we have the other GB orders fulfilled by weeks end.

Finally had the time to put the new gears on from @Idea, Thanks Tom they look and fit great. I think you can add the MBS Rockstar to your excelent Gears roster of hubs. Totally worth the money and the wait....... Ha 
Finally complete and first test ride pointed out everywhere that needed some treadlock and adjustment.

Now I'm kicking around adding bindings. Can I get some feedback on these from the community? I'm not that familiar with that style of AT. I now that jumping is a big thing but more interested in stability and control if added or decreased? 
Pros and Cons

```
I don¬¥t own a lacroix but i thought the shape of the deck should give you already a stable stand and make carving pretty comfortable.
Bindings limit you in one stand position, which is more a down side for me here. 
Jumping with an under board battery tray is in my eyes not the best idea ether :sweat_smile:
So all in all I don¬¥t see a need for bindings on a lacroix.
```

## \#34 Posted by: taz Posted at: 2019-02-19T06:26:21.345Z Reads: 63

```
I could not agree more. Apart from jumping and the added leverage for tight carving, they hinder high speed stability,  since they lock your feet in only one position.
So bottom line:
Mountain board = bindings
Lacroix with bindings = meh
```
