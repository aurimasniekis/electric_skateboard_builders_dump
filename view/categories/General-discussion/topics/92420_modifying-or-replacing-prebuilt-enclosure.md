I bought a cheap Blackhawk Urban single hub board because I value portability above performance for my short flat commute, plus it is an easy unit to deck swap, which I already have done onto a 33" deck.

But I want to go further and stick it on a Boardup folding deck.

The enclosure is 24cm long x 10cm wide x 3cm thick which is too long for the back of the deck. What will fit though is an enclosure half the length x twice the width, or 12cm long x 20cm wide....same volume but almost square instead of rectangle.

Before tearing into the enclosure, just trying to gauge how feasible this sounds.
