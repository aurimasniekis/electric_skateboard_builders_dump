Hey All,

Just got here and I'm slowly designing an electric longboard. Haven't bought any parts yet but I had a question about battery enclosures. I have a friend with a 3D printer and was going to use his. I was going to use PLA plastic, but he mentioned you lose structural integrity around 60 degress C (140 F). I'm still trying to decide what kind of battery set up I'm going to use, but is PLA plastic safe to use as an enclosure material? I know ABS plastic holds up noticeably better, but it's also more expensive. Any and all thoughts are welcome.

-MH

PLA will last about 3 minutes.  ABS or better if you are gonna print. Vacuum formed ABS is best.  Talk to @psychotiller, he's the king of enclosures.

PLA is very tough, but if you leave it in a hot car, or the batterys get hot it will warp. ABS is around the same price as PLA, but very hard to print without warping. Try PETG, best of both worlds.

I've had a friend use ABS and he's only had problems with it, mainly layer separation causing the enclosure to split in half. He's going to try putting a layer of fiberglass inside of the enclosure to reenforce it. You could also try what @danielz said and use PETG, I use it and it's great but I think you may still have the same problem as the prior.

A lot is down to the skill of the printer and the tools he has. Unless he has a 100c heated bed, an enclosure and decent bed surface, dont even attempt large ABS parts. Try PLA see how you go, keep it out of hot cars lol.

I dont own 3d printer so dont quote me, but I did research cuz I was going to buy.
PLA, baking  seems to increase the tensil strength and layer adhesion, but decrease size in XYZ
ABS, u can aceton bath, makes super tough complete adherent.
Nylon, u need decent printer, need dry box.
Also, u can epoxy coat.

ill be using PLA for my prototypes because its so east to print. Im using active cooling anyway, so its unlikely to see 60c. My PLA drone is holding up perfectly.

I'd say if your planning on buying your parts from like Shapeways or something I'd recommend just buying a real enclosure. You also may want to buy a 3D printer cause they are really useful and only about $200 nowadays if your ok with some DIY'ness.

not planning anything on enclosure or the printer yet. I want some decent size printer but those at least cost me 350. a bit much from my budget.

Thanks for the input guys. Not sure I'm gonna get my own printer- I'm trying to keep things relatively cheap. How hot do LiPo batteries get during active use? I wasn't planning on any active cooling, but a heat sink is not out of the question.

highest i got was 50c and that was from rc bashing and puffing lipos. u dont have to worry too much on active cooling

Alright well if you do start looking for a printer I have the Anet E10 and other than a couple stupid things you need to fix it's great for only $270 on GearBest. Printing area is quite large at 220x270x300 though the CR-10 is a better option, but at $400. It's funny I bought it for $300 right when it came out saying it was going to go up to $370 after the "flash deal" and I knew it wasn't going to, but I didn't realize it was going to go down another $30! Sometimes I really hate GearBest lol.

@maxhost4 your LiPos shouldn't even get warm if your using LiPo's like the foil pouch ones for RC cars and whatever because they have a high C rating compared to 18650's which get a bit warm under load though this obviously depends from pack to pack.

I used ABS for my enclosure and it lasted about 12 miles before the front part of it split down a layer... Should have printed it in a different orientation.

I managed to use gorilla glue to bond it back together, with the addition of a healthy reinforcement of Scotch fiber tape on the inside of the enclosure.  I've now hit the 30-mile mark on very sub-par roads and it's still running strong.  If you're gonna print an enclosure for the batteries, make sure the layers are perpendicular to the board, so the stresses don't cause de-lamination.  I would also just throw some fiber tape in there for extra security, this stuff is great.  You can even use it to wrap your batteries for extra protection against vibration.

The problem with PLA is that it is too stiff, so it will no deform, or it will resist the loading and your deck is gonna be stiffer too

ABS is way more flexible and better for mechanical parts, in other words it can absorb more energy than PLA

PLA will also decompose with time since its biodegradable, another big problem is that it's hard to glue, and most printer can't print an enclosure in one part

Printing ABS is not hard, but requires a heated bed and a very good adhesion to it, currently I use a purpose made liquid that leaves no residue on the parts and when cool the pieces pop of the bed. But when hot if you try to remove you will shatter the glass. Also is better to print in natural (natural, not white) ABS than the ones with color, since some pigments affect layer adhesion

ABS is also easy to glue using acetone, it melts the plastic from two parts together and they become one, in more like cold welding than gluing 

These are my enclosures all printed in ABS

I have a 3d printed enclosure. Works great so far. I printed it in parts. Recently one part broke because I basically drop the board. I think you can use PLA but you got to be careful. PETG probably your best choice.

Good to know. I haven't actually decided what the enclosure is gonna look like yet- I may even do some kind of hybrid enclosure with segmented parts. Kind of spitballing at this point

I've gone around 60 miles with my eclosure made from petg. Currently it Is actually attatched by some metal plumbers tape and the 3d printed part is just making the shape. I plan to use screws soon but I need to get to a final design first

I've been using a PLA enclosure for the ~3 weeks maybe 100 miles. 

https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/build1-torqueboards-v2-trucks-sk3-6364-190kv-10s5p-vesc/25814/13

It has cracked in several places but it's also very thin and I've been able to patch it up with some PLA 'welding'. I intend to replace it with an ABS or PETG enclosure eventually, but I think PLA might be doable if it is printed relatively thick and kept out of sunlight/ heat.

tougher than abs just more brittle. people just print & design things badly, layers the wrong way, incorrect infill, wrong temps, not annealing parts. The above post a case in point

ABS printing correctly is the better choice for an esk8 as it more flexible and heat resistant, there is just a lot of misunderstanding about PLA, like its hardness and it being naturally biodegradable, it isnt. It only biodegrades using certain special enzymes,

ABS is definitely stronger than PLA I made risers out of both the PLA ones disintegrated over time the ABS ones are still holding up so far.  PLA is great for accuracy because it doesn't go through nearly as much warping while actually printing but will get warped by heat over time as well (though it's not terrible unless you leave a PLA part in hot sun, say on a car dashboard).

Nylon beats them both by a long shot but is really hard to print large parts with like an enclosure because it wants to warp no matter what you do.  I have a temperature controlled enclosure around my printer and I still had troubles printing large nylon parts since you need to print slowly due to its hardness and slipperiness and the chances for failure during that time or water absorption are high.

For battery enclosures definitely at least ABS and like others listed reinforcing with some sort of fiber refinforced tape (gorrilla glue brand duck tape is what I use) can make it work and just need to be conscious of delamination between layers and direction your print (you want to print it sideways not the direction it will sit on the board so the layer lines don't go up and down with gravity/batteries pulling on them).  I've been using an ABS battery enclosure to hold 2 5S 5Ah LiPo packs for over a year and a half but have had to give it a painting with ABS slurry (nasty stuff) and clamp it to fix it a few times, still with the chemical bonding it had held up despite not looking great anymore.  Long story short don't print the wrong direction and use ABS go with about 3-4mm walls at least and you should be good (also put lots of reinforcing around the screw holes they are the part most likely to break off I made mine about .5" thick around the screw holder part.

I do also think PETG is the best bet. I have ridden my board for a while now with petg enclosures and it is holding up nicely. Make sure you achieve good bonding between layers with whatever material you choose to use. My enclosures are 4mm thick with about 30% infill. I mounted them on rubber mounts which takes away most of the stress from the deck flexing.

I find that PLA is stronger than ABS when well printed, but it has no flex so it is fragile. For longboard use it is not the best material. ABS is better, but when I print big objects as enclosure, I get warping. Recently I started using PETG and it is really dope and my number one choice for enclosure. I will use PLA only for prototypes since I can print PLA faster and I have lot of it.
