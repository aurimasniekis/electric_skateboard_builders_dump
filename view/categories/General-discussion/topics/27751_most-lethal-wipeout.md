So yesterday I finished my board, and I was extremely hyped to start using it. literally everything was duck taped onto the board except for my motor. At first I was hesitant to stand on top of it while riding, so I decided to ride it sitting down. I took my board to the end of the street so I could see it's top speed when putting it to use. I sat down, and slowly started to push forward on my controller. My board went faster and faster and then it started to wobble.  I totally lost control, ditched the board, fell and gashed my hands up. Luckily the board was not harmed, just took a hard landing after flying up the sidewalk. I learned a good lesson which is to never go full throttle. And a reminder to always wear your helmet

What are your wipe out stories? I would love to hear them :)

I meant ducktape. 
Are you talking about this remote? ---> diy-electric-skateboard-kits-parts/torqueboards-2-4ghz-nano-remote-controller/

I know I was just kidding :laughing:

That's the v2 version of the remote that I'm using now, it's reliable and doesn't suffer from the same issues as the v1

I have found that it is much harder to correct for speed wobbles when seated!! It seems like it would be easier to try a hill sitting because if you have to bail you have less distance to fall but if you are standing you can correct for speed wobble by just carving.

Ate it really bad two days ago.  Was riding back from a street festival and cruising down a sort of major street (2 lanes but moderate traffic) and was going near top speed my board can do and think I must have just hit a rock or crack and quickly got some uncontrollable wobble.  Tried slowing down a bit with the remote but was just bad timing and any amount of brake I was able to apply ended up just tossing me from the board.  Hit the pavement pretty hard on my side, had a helmet on but no other gear really.  Ended up scuffying my arm a bit but can barely feel that, pretty sure I broke a rib, didn't feel it at first cause of the adrenaline and just rode home but laid up the rest of the day Saturday after cruising slowly home, last couple of days just been icing it and taking some ibuprofen but pretty sure not much else can be done.  Not really sure that more safety gear would have helped in this case more a matter of knowing your limits and not getting complacent with the speed.  Have been riding an electric board for over a year so wasn't for lack of experience just too much confidence not enough caution.

A few months back I was only going about 15 mph on a messed up street. I ended up hitting a crack, not going THAT fast. I had just finished the board a week earlier, and had just gotten a full face motorcycle helmet the day before (it was cheaper than a longboard one). Because I was so new to eSk8, when I hit that crack, I immediately shut the throttle back to full break. Between this and all the other cracks in the road, it forced be off face first. I tried to run it out, but obviously couldnâ€™t. I hip first, then chin. I slid probably a few feet before coming to a stop. Thank god I wore the full face helmet or I definitely would have had a major concussion, and probably a broken jaw and some teeth. The asphalt ripped through my pants and thin sweatshirt. I got a big abrasion on my stomach and a bit of a smaller one on my left elbow. They eventually, after two months, healed into permanent bruise scars. Since then I have gotten a protective jacket and reduced the breaking settings on my board. All in all, I got really lucky.

I was riding a friend's Bamboo GT in Japan a few weeks ago. He decided to use his Benchwheel, cause he said he was scared of the brakes on the GT. Even on the 2nd speed mode (out of 4, forget what it was called), the brakes were crazy twitchy. Way more than I'm used to on my board.

Nonetheless, I got used to them after about a half an hour. My friend got a little bit ahead of me on a bike path, so I pushed the throttle up to about 20-25km/h. I saw some pretty bad looks cracks in the path coming up, so I tried to slow down just a touch.. but the brakes kicked in hard and fast, making my ankles lose balance. The speed wobbles got so intense that the board just turned a sharp left (those GTs turn on a dime), throwing me off onto some pretty rocky concrete. I scraped my hands and knee pretty badly, but managed to roll onto my side, so that nowhere else took serious damage. My helmet protected my noggin, but I didn't have wrist/palm guards with me on my trip. I now wear them all the time, haha.

Gotcha yeah have only used the head mount style so far will be sure to watch out for that if/when I get one of those "selfy-sticks" too.

you guys and your cool wipouts.  I always get uncontrollable speed wobble past 20mph even when I have tightened my trucks as much as they would go.  

My worst wipeout would be going over train lines in my city center.  I though if I got enough speed I would be able to "glide" over them with only a sharp bump.  turns out my wheels got completely stuck in the line and I went over head first at 20 mph in the middle of the road :stuck_out_tongue:  Luckily I was able to land into a roll so I only got a graze,  taught me the good old lesson of dont fuck with train lines ( and rolling is better than grinding )

Make sure you put your weight in the front of your board and you'll experience a lot less wobbles.

ill make sure I try that,  I tend to always lean backwards due to being petrified of a bit of over breaking!  I really want to get to the point I can run my board at max speed ( 38mph ) but I always have been stopped by the wobble

Weight forward, stay low. Keeping your center of gravity low will help with balance.

its super scary to get down and lean forward at speed it almost feels like im going to fall forward but it does work i get alot less speed wobble. I get the worst speed wobbles if i ride too much after work, im on my feet all day at work (12 hour shifts 5 days a week) I can tell a huge difference in how i ride if its on my day off i have alot more control and confidence but after a long day at work i feel more "sloppy" on the board.

A little kid decided to jump out in front of me while going about 30mph. Bailed out to avoid hitting him.

ive had someone do that to me. honnestly I didnt even concider bailing because that would put me in more danger than plowing into him - if people are gonna be silly around fast moving objects they have to expect a bad time.

Pedestrians have the right of way around here and if it's a little kid they probably don't expect an electric skateboard when they see a guy on a skateboard can't really expect them to be making rational decisions (some kids like skateboards and all kids make bad decisions).  Seeing as how we can't get insurance to cover medical costs of others for the boards if you do crash into someone, it's probably better to avoid it and take the down time and medical costs personally over being sued.... might vary depending on where you're at and local laws and whatnot, but I always lean towards damaging myself over hurting a bystander.

Have seen a person on Lake Shore Drive out here get nailed by a bicyclist and get brought away in an ambulance.

Think bailing was the right thing to do @SeanHacker, bummer it ended with the broken collar bone though (best friend broke his in high school so know that's a super crappy bone to break in terms of trying to heal up).  My rib is still pretty messed up but can breathe a lot more regularly now without being in pain so that's good (maybe just bruised it instead of broke it but didn't get it checked out).

The remotes / radio are crap on the Evolve GT... well speaking, also the rest of the build components.  I had a GT, buggiest board ever and the remote / radio is so vulnerable to any RF interference.  Sent the POS back and got a refund after Evolve couldn't fix the issues but kept denying there were any.

Was hauling ass down my street on the 4th of July, probably doing about 30 mph. Me being a dumbass was showing off and wearing shorts and T-shirt, no helmet, no protective gear. 
I approached a stop sign, went to hit the brakes, and nothing, board stopped responding. I go to footbrake, get speed wobbles, and eat shit, rolling 3 times and scraping up my hands and elbows and ankles. My board goes flying, and ends up flipped over, jammed in full throttle. 
For some reason it was stuck on full throttle which was probably what caused me to wipe out when I tried to footbrake.
