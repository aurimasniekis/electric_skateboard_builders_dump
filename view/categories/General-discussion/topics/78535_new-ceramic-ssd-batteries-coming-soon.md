So these new ceramic pouch type solid state batteries. 
If the price is right ill prob pic some up... for science. Seems like 2 c max discharge. 

Small and larger version. They also have a flexible version, but  very low c

Reading through the specs and i can't determine the actual discharge capacity, maybe i'm blind. It looked like it just says 2CmA everywhere. So what, 10 amps? 15amps? 2C of what? That's just a multiplier.  

everything else about these makes me want to try them too. No fires? bonus. abuse tolerant? more bonus. the size isn't terrible either.

```
Constant discharge 0.4 amps / momentary max 4 amps

If you used about 240 of these they might match what we are currently using.



The larger cell has constant current is 1.6 amps, max 16 amps

This one looks like it might work but I don't see any dimensions for the thickness?

I see max 2c discharge. Id assume 1c would be fine and at 8300 mah...so 10 amps would prob be a safe bet.
The smaller ones1950 mah around 2 amps per.

The discharge graph shows its fine at 1c... curve gets worse after 1.5c

These would take up a lot more room in an enclosure and would be more likely to break I would think.  We would all be riding around with psychotiller's bigly mounted to our boards

I did some rough calculations after looking harder and finding the thickness. 

These will offer a little less than half the capacity of the leading 18650 cells.

I've been waiting for these so I can use them to light up my helmet. Don't want lipo or li-ion in my helmet. IT would not feel good if I smack my head into one of those, but these are safe.

Ya after doing some math these arent for eskate really. Unless they can bump up the discharge a bit. But i have other plans.

Just stick with the 18650. The number of cells you need exceeds the amount for a compact size. These cells are better for large pack design.

For the 8300mAh pack. 1C=8.3 amps. 2C=16.6 amps, but you burn that amount in 30 mins according to the math used for calculating C. I hate when C rating is used because it's a useless metric when overrated.

Is this the higher discharge PLCB? The company makes a high discharge model, still it's only about half the energy density of an 18650 if I remember correctly

There promising a higher wh/l for there plcb car packs than teslas 18650 packs.

i am hyped for florid based SSD batteries. But still along way until they are usable, if ever^^

I’ve seen some high discharge fast charge titanium tech coming out LTO, could be promising but capacity not on par yet

I mean we all still waiting on teslas 2070... that will replace 18650... but i dunno these ceramic flexible pouches seem cool. And usefull

GreatScott! tested batteries from prologium. Seems like there are really safe.

Not Sure that will ever Happen. There has been No movement from other products to Switch to 20xxxx. Not in a noticeable way. And new technology is in the way already.  I think they will mostly stay on 18650 and Go to the newer thing

By far the most interesting tidbit on their site:

"Because there is no liquid/jelly type electrolyte inside LCB, ProLogium successfully put through worldwide first BiPolar+ Cell, which is able to do direct-serial and parallel inside cell. Hence, single BiPolar+ cell can reach 60V or higher, the design of BMS, shunt, and protection circuit can be simplified. What’s more, the cost of battery pack can be much lower."

Teslas is already using there new 2070 cells in model 3.

Just waiting for some after market batterys to come out.

ofc Tesla uses them. But in general i don't see a big shift in the market towards 20xxx. What do you mean with after market batteries? Like Tesla is gonna sell them or what?

You can buy the old battery packs for cheap. It’s about 2-3k for a big block of cells

 So many points of failure.  Shame we can’t find a 10ah single cell that is half decent

Ys what pat said. I meant it as more "used market" than after market. Same same tho. 

Just need those bat packs to hit ebay...  i know jack rickard  at evtv got one and did a vid, but didnt really get to a cell break down. More of a pack as a whole.

I think I saw how the cells are removed by shorting the pack on electric sphere, it was kind of cool and destroyed the marine jump wires used

There definitely are high quality 10Ah cells, if you start to look into prismatic cells.

What 10ah or around that have u seen that have good power?  Lithium ion or something energy dense

Tenergy makes a good prismatic lithium cell. It's the 30123 model, about 60mm x 9mm x 155mm excluding the tabs.

It's rated at a 50A continuous discharge and 100A for 10 seconds.

From my testing, you can get nearly 10Ah of discharge out of it up to 30A. Discharging at 50A continuous it is closer to 8000mah. Given the size of the cell I'm satisfied with that.

The cell goes by a bunch of other names from wholesale fronts, but Tenergy has good QA from my experience. They even refunded a cell that got damaged in shipping.
