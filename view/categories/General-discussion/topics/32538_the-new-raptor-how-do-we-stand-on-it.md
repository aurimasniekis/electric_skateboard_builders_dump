@onloop I feel like i may need to do a review of this new Raptor. I have to admit, its fast. But i'm not sure how you're supposed to stand on it, and its probably going to need a pretty big carry handle. And the brakes look a little touchy. And there's a guy sitting in it. WTF is even happening here? How are you going to park your 4Runner on this?

Star-Lord seems to really be enjoying his Raptor

Ho hell yeah!!!! @onloop so glad to finally see a off road version of the Raptor...

@longhairedboy you don't need big handle when you got 4 of them.

so maybe me and my three friends can carry it into the 7-11? I'm just confused. 

Is it still 10S? What kind of watt hours are we looking at here? Should i be trying to run this drive system at 12S too?

I don't like how loud that commercial was.  It's too cocky and aggressive made me feel insecure.  Also, that truck is pretty poorly engineered.  I can tell by the way the door hands are positioned.

My boards have the same affect on some people.
