Hey all,

I just recently had a crash from speed wobbles at 30 mph. I was only wearing my TSG evolution helmet and some gloves with some wrist protection. My helmet saved my life, and the wrist protection and gloves saved my hands & wrists.
 
My face and knees were untouched, but I wish I was wearing my armored jacket, the road rash is definitely a pain, but nothing that bad; I'm half way healed after a week.

I have to get a new helmet, and I was wondering if it was worth upgrading to a TSG pass, or if I should go for something like a Triple Eight MIPS helmet with some sunglasses (for my eyes). I live in so cal, so I have to consider the heat.

Im from SD originally but live in nyc area now... I was fine all summer...in real heat....with humidity.. With a pass. Closing the lid can get hot sure but I kept it up mostly...if you were lot's of day riding in heat id say just pull the visor for the hottest months and wear sunglasses...

Glad you're OK! Falling at 30mph sounds scary af. But dude, for the love of skatan get a full face helmet! I don't really think "normal" type of helmets are sufficient when you're riding at those speeds.

As for the TSG Pass, I haven't really tried other "full-faces" but it seems to be very popular among the comunity and I can only speak well of it. I slammed the back of my head pretty hard when my old deck snapped and I'm pretty sure I would have been at least blind without it. The sun-visor (or whatever it's called) is really nice for sunny days, also got vents to keep you cool on hot days. I live in Sweden though so conditions are probably not comparable :stuck_out_tongue:

Falling was pretty scary, but it actually wasnt the worst thing.
What is the real advantage of the full face, other than the fact that you cant turn your face into a meat grinder?

Hi,
I've received my new board a few days ago the new and amazing LaCroix Nazare.
So as I was unable to wait to get new protection, I did it with my old one, but the first thing I will do next week will to buy a high-end helmet, as this board is an amazing power engine.

So after many videos, reads, forums, my short list is:
Specialized Ambush with ANGi,
Full-Face Downhill Bike Helmet,
Bell Super DH MIPS,
Bell Full-9.

(This list is not orderged).
All of them are from mountain bike or dh bike universe and are certified,
Most of them are Mips V2 (spherical) 2 are fullface, one is hybrid and another one is a standard helmet.

Yesterday I've discovered a web site which also is going into the same selection: https://www.outdoorgearlab.com/t/biking-helmets

I've got a beard to hide my already ground-up face :stuck_out_tongue:

Seriously though, there's got to be a reason pretty much all type of riders after a certain speed use a full face. Another pro for me would be the great field of view the Pass offers, fits snuggly (no wiggle room when turning head), boosts confidence and most of all: hides my my ugly face and doesn't cause people to think terrorists now ride E-sk8's.

Also, the Pass has a sexy clean look without screaming for attention imo. I've got the the s(k)atin black one.

Good luck on choosing, let us know what u end up with!

I haven't tried it with any glasses but I can imagine it being similiar to your case, either super tight to the point of it hurting or not at all.

Im guessing you're talking about normal glasses and not sun glasses? For the sun, the visor works great imo.

TSG pass is good with he heat as long as you're moving 15+mph. That's coming from Norcal valley where it get's 100+ in the summer. I ride full gear even when it's that hot out and my head is always the coolest part of me lol. Also nice to have a visor when going fast for bugs, and in the winter to keep your eyes from freezing over. I wear glasses fine with it.

Yea, I’m also in so cal, I ride pretty much daily in traffic in and around downtown LA... day, night, rush hour. my board is basically my car. I regularly ride over 30 mph.

After a fall about 2 years ago where I broke 2 ribs and lacerated my scalp,  I’ve kinda been obsessed with NOT getting so damaged WHEN I fall. Since then, I’ve got an armored leather biker jacket, Kevlar lined jeans, and recently, a TSG Pass helmet. I wear all of this, all the time. 

Also no problem wearing Oakley sunglasses with the TSG Pass. I do nearly every day.

A friend of mine who rides motorcycles told me one of the most common body parts to hit in a high side accident is your chin. He showed me the stats on motorcycle accident injuries to riders without helmets, and sure enough, one of the most common points of damage as reported by U.S. emergency rooms was lower mandible. 

Personally, I have a hard time calling the machine that I ride a “skateboard”.... since it’ll hit 40mph on flat ground... and I “ride” it like a motorcycle in the street surrounded by cars and other traffic.

I’ve had half a dozen falls over 25... probably 2-3 falls over 30 mph... walked away every time due to wearing the right gear. Without it, I KNOW at least one fall probably would ended me, and at least one more woulda shattered my elbow and left me a bloody mess.

Yes, it makes it pretty hot riding in 90 degree weather.

But It’s just easier to wash off sweat than blood.

Go TSG Pass... it’s expensive, but given the risks... I just wouldn’t ride with it

Any helmet is better than none I guess, I'd still recommend a full face for eskating. Don't let price be a safety factor, invest in yourself!

@Alpacaslapper, as far as helmet recommendations, I’ve had the triple eight invader and demon podium and strongly prefer the demon podium. It’s currently high 80s to mid 90s and I’ve had no issues with it breathing well.

Plus it makes you super cute.

You have convinced me to get the tsg pass. I was thinking about getting some Kevlar jeans, but I didn't know where to find them. 

Also, how do you keep your board stable at 40? How much do you have to tighten your trucks? Is there anything else you can do? (My board will also easily hit 40)

Thanks

Agreed, in general regarding weight distribution... 

AS far as protection... I think that’s much harder to say. Both helmets pass the same euro safety standard, the EN 1078. The demon podium passes the CSPC standard in the US, and the TSG Pass helmet passes the ASTM 1952-10. The CSPC Is considered the slightly harder standard overall. 

That said, the ASTM 1952-10 is specifically for downhill mountain biking, and thus one very important test... the anvil drop test (dropping helmet from a specific height onto a steel anvil), is conducted from a greater height than the CSPC test.

In truth, it’s probably about a wash between the two. 

It’s likely that only a very few, very specific types of impacts would one have any meaningful difference in outcome and injury or prevention of injury... maybe. 

Not sure how the podium stands up to multiple impacts. I know the TSG is one crash and done. 

The TSG Pass WILL be better for winter riding in Southern California. A full face helmet with a snug fit visor will always shield away cold air better than a visorless helmet. It gets cold sometimes hitting 30+ on a night thats below 50 degrees... but the TSG Pass was still the most comfortable option, for keeping my Face from going completely numb after a few miles in 40ish degree temps. 

Price and style are significantly different. Personally, I prefer the style of the TSG.

Let’s not forget a motorcycle helmet would probably offer the MOST safety, but due to the bulk of the helmet, it actually underperforms the TSG Pass in a real world situation when downhill skateboarding... at least that’s what I’ve heard.

I really don’t think one could go wrong with either helmet... Podium or Pass. Just a matter of budget and aesthetic/ergonomic differences.

Great! Glad to hear it. Personally for me, the TSG Pass is the best mix of style, comfort, functionality, and protection for my riding environment and style of riding.

As for how to keep a board stable at speed... 
A general answer is something like:

1. Lower center of gravity
2. Longer and wider wheelbase 
3. Lower the front and back truck pivot angle
4. Have a dissimilar pivot angle of front and.         
    back truck (Saturn_corp mentioned... and 
    I agree, this is one is crucial)
5. Put more weight on front foot (probably THE single most important factor in preventing speed wobbles)...

Also, I should say I’ve gotten up to and over 40mph... topped out at 41.4mph... but I don’t ride regularly at those speeds. On any given day, I’ll hit 37. but faster than that, and it requires me to make stance and balance alterations that I wouldn’t be able to “instantly” undo should I need to make some evasive maneuver... so really I can only tell you how my setup is stable up to about 37-38mph... above that speed, it’s much more rider technique than the setup itself.

I don’t want to derail the thread, so I’ll stop here...

I’ll  start a different thread, and see if I can post a few pics and/or a video to show my setup, riding at speed, etc.

Thanks for all this info. I'm not sure what you mean by "pivot angle", though. 

I'm already riding on a 40 inch board with 218 mm trucks, so I don't think wheelbase is in issue. I am going to stick my motors out the back, since I don't have enough room under my board (dual 6380s) without putting spacers, which would raise my center of gravity.

But a detailed description on what the hell pivot angle is would be tremendously helpful. My goal is to feel fully stable and completely safe at 35.

P.S. I'm riding torqueboard's Caliber II trucks

The TSG Pass won't protect as well as the Podium? What exactly are you basing this on? The Pass seems to be WAY more popular among the comunity. After reading this and your "not promotional" thread about the AE board I sincerely don't know what to think...

Edit: I'm not saying the Pass is better, I'm just suprised you're claiming the opposite with confidence.

Anyways, glad to see you've decided to go on a full-face OP! Remeber, faces wont grow prettier with time, so you better take care of it :stuck_out_tongue:

If you feel it's better because of the price, I can totally dig that. However, you said the Pass WON'T protect as well as the Podium, and now you're saying they offer the SAME protection but prefer Podium due to price.

I don't know if there's some language barrier here but I feel I can't really take your word for anything you've said when you're writing conflicting statements. It makes it look like you're a promoter or something.

Anyways, I'm sticking to my Pass.

A general guideline for split angles is that more kingpin angle gives more maneuverability and lower angle gives more stability. Really it just take some playing around to figure out what feels good.

I recommend getting an angled riser of somewhere around 5-7 degrees for the rear truck to start with. Angled risers are much cheaper than new baseplates although they add height which isn't a problem unless you don't want risers.  You'll also need bushings of a harder durometer in the back to account for the change in angle. 

Once you give that a try you can experiment with either more or less angle and harder/different shape bushings for the truck you're dewedging. Leave the front alone for now unless you're unhappy with the turning radius, then you can adjust as needed.

Another option is a synthetic split. In this scenario you leave the angles alone but run different bushings in back. I'd say 1 notch harder than what's in there now but it any not be enough to be comfortable at high speed.


if you're really jonesing for rock solid stability, a 10 degree split works wonders. I'm running 45/35 on my speed board with a single notch harder (but bigger as well) bushing in back and it feels like nothing scary comes from the back even at 40mph. Not that I go that fast often lol. Slow speed turning suffers a bit but it's worth it if you go fast regularly and you can overcome it with lots of lean. Just won't b e a carving machine at running speed.

Alright, thanks for the tips. I'm running an Evo Falcon 40, so I'll have to account for the difference from the angle in the board itself.

To do that would I just measure the truck angle relative to the ground? (As opposed to the deck)

## \#42 Posted by: Saturn_Corp Posted at: 2019-09-10T15:17:37.141Z Reads: 48

Better to add the know  angle of the deck on top of the baseplate angle for an accurate measure. Measuring with a protractor likely won't be very accurate.

The evo has a nice split already. So if you haven't done anything yet I'd say start out with trying a harder durometer bushing in back without changing anything else.

honestly just looking at the 2 I'd say the TSG is better for road use,

falling at 40 mph on clear road, I feel like the tsg would do a better job of slipping and not getting caught on anything.


Also OP I think your tsg pass was cheaper than a head-scan.

So, if your riding an evo then you are already using a very “split angle” setup already...
Not sure the standard baseplate angle on the TB trucks, but if it’s 50, you might want to try swapping out the front for a 44 or 45 degree baseplate... and maybe same with the back trucks... lower angle will stabilize the board overall...

Hey, so you mentioned torqueboard trucks... are you using the stock bushings/pivotcups/washers they came with?

I’ve heard the pivot cups are really not stable. And similar things about the bushings being bad. 

I would check out alphamail’s thread on bushings and tuning your trucks... 

Might be just a pivot cup brushing adjustment...

Yeah looks like that was the main suggestion. I have the cups and bushings figured out, toqueboards recommend switching them out right on their website. The part I wasn't sure about was the split angle. If you think that the split angle that the Evo sets up is good enough, then that is what I'll stick with.

Context. It's for a Evo so his recommendation is solid. Evo adds wedge to the front and dewedge in the rear. So u want 44 baseplates in front and 50 rear to end up with something like 51 front 43 rear

Here @AlanZhou

And @Xyven u want harder duro bushings in the rear especially with lower angle trucks since u have more leverage.

And tsg pass sucks in the summer especially when you're not moving. In the winter is really good because it blocks the wind

Generally, yes, “never” have a lower angle front truck than your back truck...

That said, specifically for the “Evo” deck... I believe the split from the decks produced in recent years is about 12 degree wedge in front, 12 degree dewedge in back... that’s a 24 degree total difference.


If he changes his front baseplate to a 44 or 45 degree baseplate, it WOULD become less “twitchy”... and since the difference of angle split is so great between the front and back... his front truck setup would still would have 18 or 19 degree higher angle than his rear truck setup...

This is just because the evo is highly wedged and dewedged when compared to other decks... on most decks you couldn’t do
This without running into the problem of having a more steering sensitive rear truck.:. Which is what you DONT want.

Keep in mind that even the mountain bike impact test (ASTM F1952) is designed to prevent death during a drop test where the impact is 13.9 mph (22.3 kph).  Hopefully your angle of impact isn't this bad, but you might look into getting a motorcycle helmet (ECE rated or even better, Snell M2015 rated).  They weigh more and are larger, but the physics of what you're doing far exceeds what a bike helmet is designed to do.  This website articulates as much: [https://helmets.org/powered.htm ](https://helmets.org/powered.htm)

As for skate/bike helmets, the TSG Pass and Triple 8 racer are the safest on the market (Zero Gravity Vector also if you can find one) with face shields.  My previous post digresses: https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/helmet-guide-these-70-skate-bicycle-helmets-have-the-best-impact-ratings/59646
