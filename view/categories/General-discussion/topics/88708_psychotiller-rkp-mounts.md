Anybody experience this happening? About 30 miles on them. I tried to contact him thru email and thru his site with no reply. Is there anyone else that makes mounts for the surfrodz 200mm that's tried and true?![20190329_094810|374x500](upload://3wwYj628mopZiCZbUq5efrcEGWP.jpeg) ![20190329_094833|374x500](upload://qDOplTXLKCWKRgFKk6vDng0R4gH.jpeg)

Thanks for the reply. I wasn't trying to get anything for free but I don't want to buy the whole mount. Just the press on parts

No clue. I'm allergic to bad roads üòä
No binding, board rides smooth. My other 2 builds has tkp mounts and they are much thicker

Is it too much belt tension?

Not at all. I run my belts a little less than snug if you will

yeah, tight belts can cause that issue. @psychotiller should get back to you when he has a moment.

This happened on both sides?

@psychotiller is also just one dude that actually make alot of this own parts like the six shooters and enclsoures. These mounts are used by a lot of guys on here and I have never heard of this happening before

That‚Äôs crazy!  Yeah I agree with Mike and think that a belt too tight could cause that as well especially depending on the roads and terrain you‚Äôre driving on. I also know that when I was talking to him at his house a while back he said that he did get a bad batch of random select mounts were not all of them were 100% accurate for example the ones I got originally would not press fit like they‚Äôre supposed to because they were just a tiny bit off on the dimensions when being machined or something so not sure if that could‚Äôve caused it maybe too since he didn‚Äôt know until After the fact cause it was only a select few that were a hair off in areas but they still worked..  no way to know which ones had anything slightly wrong with them though. Most people wouldn‚Äôt even realize and couldn‚Äôt tell either‚Ä¶ 

 Are you going on Sunday @Mikenopolis ? I will be there for the ride for sure!

I think that you should have installed more screws, the back of the mount seems completely unsupported thus inducing additional bending torque on the mount.

If it's not the bolts issue, I feel like a mount shouldn't be breaking before a belt due to simply a belt tightness issue. I hope it's not just tight belts breaking these mounts.

I have 3 nuts and bolts in each side. It's pretty solid. That's all the holes that aligned

Can't make it at that time. Gonna be in LA. Enjoy, hopefully Chris takes you guys through the Woodbridge Lake area, I always circle that area on my weekend rides into the office

hmmm...i haven't seen an email or a message on my site from you. 

i don't have those mounts anymore as i made larger ones so that the mount plate can fit inside or outside on 176's or 200mm hangers. i have some new ones but they will require the larger plates as well. 

I haven't seen any of these break yet, so i'd have to agree with most comments about belt tension or a hard hit. The only other thing it could be is crushing torque.

i'll sell you the new ones half price if you'd like?

I would assume air pockets in aluminum. If belt tension can break it then it's not how it should be. I don't see any signs of hard hits. There's always a first for everything and you just got unlucky :(

Exactly, that's basically like the boosted motor shaft bending issue

""Don't over tighten your belts and don't ride on sidewalks and your motor shafts won't bend"

^boosted fanboy 

Your belt should snap through tension before your motor mount bends, but it's just prob a few air bubbles lol

![image|666x500](upload://zTMI3mTf8kg6otcILm79h2eHGGd.jpeg) No more than 30 minutes after seeing this picture I just had one do the same thing. I had stopped using the outmost mount hole because I couldn‚Äôt get the bolt to stay tight. Even with red loctite. I think my bracket may have been hitting underside of board on hard kick turns. ![image|375x500](upload://2oT0rR06aJfB4aUq48E3DuIJ2Fr.jpeg)

I found one of the older version off of a demo board. If you want that one for free, give me an address.

This could definitely be what is happening.

I used loctite blue initially then cleaned and put on red and they loosened but I didn‚Äôt realize it was most likely due to contact with board. Gonna chalk it up as another lesson learned.

Acetone, Isopropyl alcohol or methanol would easily make sure it is clean and any grease that some bolts are packaged in is taken off.
