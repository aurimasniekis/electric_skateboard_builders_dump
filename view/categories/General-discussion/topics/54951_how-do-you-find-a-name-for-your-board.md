You don't find the name, the name finds you.

Or you just name it lol I dunno man whatever floats your boat :D 

I'm gonna go out on a limb and say you should call it "SupahSqurl" because it's sure to be nuts

After suspending belief for 8 seasons of walking dead, I'm tempted to pay homage to Lucille, comfort may be a problem

Day Walker was because of Wesley Snipe's movies "Blade", as I intend to stay trails with it at any hour of the day, Blade was not superhuman growing up like most vampires, but had Whistlers aresenal of high tech gadgets and tools at his disposal. The build is basically a incarnation of Blade, using @Kug3lis and @Nowind parts (high tech gadgets). 

But yeah @banjaxxed that's basically what I do find something I resonate with and roll with it..like Star Wars

Jedi = Master
Sith = Darth

Master Evo = like a Jedi, a beast with self control. My Evo is like Yoda lol, can flex when it needs too. Like powerful Yoda.

Darth Icarus = like the Sith, an unconventional build, as Sith are unconventionally trained, that fills my dark desires of skating.

Just find something that resonates with you... Could be anything... :). I don't call my boards by name in person(lol) But I made the names for my build threads to kind of... I dunno give a "presence" to the threads?

I chose my board name `Mark 48` after considering what I want to build and after some influence from latest Avengers movie (I am really big fan of Iron Man) I realized that this is my 3rd build and following steps of Tony Stark making his suits over and over as addiction I followed simple Mark schema and regards latest movie I named my deck Mark 48 (The suite tony used in avengers movie)

I like irony and have an adoration for the things I build. I affectionately call my Electric Mountainboard **Mishka**.

Mine is named deficit spending for what I hope are obvious reasons. Sometimes, your friends pick the name for you ;)

I don’t think I’ve ever named my boards or started a build thread. To be realistic I should name the recent one “DaFuk” since that’s what I constantly yelled out running into problems

I name my boards for what the subject matter is on the board.  The eskate I made I put the joker on it.  So I call it the clown prince

Scarlet was the name of the color of the Minwax stain i used to do my first deck. 

Phat Matson was a deck that Caden Matson asked for. 

Witchblade was something i came up with because the deck cutout reminded me of a double sided razor

Velociraptor was a play on using Enertion raptor components at 12S

I find an accurate name referring to its performance. My first board was "hot garbage" 

It ran hot and was garbage.

The last one is [The Blue One](https://forum./t/the-blue-one-12s-lifepo4-170kv-6374-caliber-2-30-43-powell-peralta-focbox/75) because it's one of a pair of almost-identical boards, and it's blue.  The other one is red.  Guess what I named that one?
