# Designing a Gear Drive for My 8th Grade Project

I'm designing a gear drive for my 8th grade year long recital project and was wondering if some people could lend a helping hand. If you've built one before, I was wondering if we could talk about how you started, the parts you used, and what was your process? I've looked through the forum and found some info, looked on sites that sell gear drives for what components I need, and reached out to some people.

I want to build it compatible to a street board, kinda like the AVIO gear drive by @nuttyjeff. The hardest part is finding a place to design and CNC the parts over the summer. If anyone has any advice, that would be appreciated. I have experience with CAD, laser cutting, and 3D printing. I'm starting research on how to CNC and design for that, does anyone have any videos that they learned from?

**I have a CNC machine at my school, along with a laser cutter and multiple 3D printers. The only problem is I can't use them over the summer.** I think I'll spend most of my time research and designing over the summer, but I don't know how long each part would take. I don't have a scope of how to manage the project.

**If someone has a good Gear Drive or can recommend one, that would be rly appreciated!**

All of my questions:

1) What program do you use to design stuff?
2) Is there any process that helped?
3) How did you start?
4) Who helped you in your process?
5) What general advice would you give?
6) Are there any posts that I can take a look at to improve my research?
7) Should I purchase a gear drive so I can take it apart and look at the parts and what I need to design?

Started using CAD last year.  Not that hard to use especially for a gear drive. Plenty of YouTube videos on how to fusion

I just ride stuff.  I get by building with help from friends here and there.  Designing a gear drive.... not so much. @moon has designed wheels,  pulleys,  2 gear drives,  3 gear drives and im sure more than that.  I would go with his advice.

i've got a large budget, 2500-3000 of my own money, but since this is a school project my parents could lend me some. (i hate asking for money) I also could sell some of my stuff, like my Raptor 2 hubs for some extra money...

Edit: I also have a CNC machine, 3d printer, and laser cutter at my school

I haven't touched a laser cutting machine and won't need to.

Everything begins in CAD and then goes to 3D printing, finally CNC machining and gear hobbing

Hi @tardyparty7,

I am also in the process of designing my own gear drive. Just a few steps in front of you.

If you need any help with anything just fly some stuff my way or even just check out my thread so far.

I am using solidworks as I have used it for many years so if your school system has the student version I can be of more help.

I dont know how much you are willing to spend, but if you are only going to make 2pcs drives (for 2WD), 3dHubs will be very expensive. For such low quantity they will probably quote you about $80-100 per piece. You will end up with about 10 single pcs total. Thats almost $1000 in only machining. 

Again I dont know how much you are willing to spend, but I think its at least worth checking out China if you dont want to pay such a high price.

Honestly this is a very ambitious project. Making gear drives is not an easy thing to do. I do not say this to discourage you from trying it. I think you should try as hard as you can and I think you might be able to succeed, however I think you should also just try to make a belt drive first because itâ€™s easier and you will learn a lot about designing things in the process. If you can successfully design a motor mount and pulley with a belt drive then move onto a gear drive.

What I do not want to happen is for you to spend a ton of time on a gear drive for it to ultimately fail and then you have nothing to show for your efforts. It would be much better for you to make a working belt drive in the first couple months of school so that you always have something to show at the end of the year. Then move onto developing the gear drive.

That's actually a really good idea. I honestly agree with you and Im going to take this route since I do want something to show at the end of the year, even if it's not a gear drive!

 I am a college student with a fair amount of experience building DIY projects such as a go cart when I was your age. It still took me a full year to build an electric skateboard that was reliable and that I was proud of showing off. That being said I also have limited time because I run my own business on top of classes so I certainly think you will be able to build an electric skateboard you are proud to show off by the end of the school year. Please contact me if you ever need any help or have questions. I also have an enclosure that you can have for free if you need one.

I may also have a motor I can give you as well. I will have to double check to make sure it works though.

Itâ€™s a 6355 260kv 3200 watt. The sensor is blowing but Iâ€™m pretty sure thatâ€™s the only thing that is wrong with it and sensors hardly make any difference in actual performance above 1 mph

Gear drive is one the easiest things to design. Just have to know how gears work. If you know how "DP" or modules play part in the meshing of gears, it's not hard to design a mounting plate.

I fully believe he can too, I just didnâ€™t want to overestimate his CAD & CNC abilities, so making something super easy 1st (like a belt drive) is always a good idea if you are a CAD & CNC noob. I have know idea who this kid is. A lot of 8th graders are dumbasses. He appears not to be in that group and should be just fine.

Based on what he is saying he must have more experience than I guessed an 8th grader would have. I wish I had access to that stuff in 8th grade. I know my future kids will! I will definitely have a CNC in my garage by then.

You should be able to easily build somthing similar well within your budget and have money left over for pizza. 

Go with heat treated steel. 

We punish our gear drives like no others. 

No lube, still on the original spur and pinion.
