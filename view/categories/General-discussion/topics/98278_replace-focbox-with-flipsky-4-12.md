Hi, I have been using Focbox. SInce it is no longer in production, I am looking for replacement. I find Flipsky VESC 4.12 (https://flipsky.net/products/torque-esc-vesc-%C2%AE-bldc-electronic-speed-controller). Can I use it as a replacement?

Yes, but. 

Yes, you can replace one with the other, but the flipsky 4.12 is much less capable than the focbox. Lower current rating, no heat spreader/heat sink, which will mean faster overheating, and only two current shunts instead of three, which makes it less bale to run FOC.

If you want an actual upgrade, I recommend the 6.6 version [here.](https://flipsky.net/collections/electronic-products/products/flipsky-fsesc-6-6-based-upon-vesc%C2%AE-6-heat-sink?variant=8739267510332)

@MysticalDork: Thank you very much for your replay.Flipsky 4.12 and Flipsky 6.0 configured with the BLDC_Tool software (http://vedder.se/2015/01/vesc-open-source-esc/)?

vesc tool actually. BLDC tool is an earlier version. But yes, they all work with Vedder's software.
