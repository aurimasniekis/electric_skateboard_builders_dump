Same thing I do in a car or on a motorcycle. I look for the smoothest path.

Exactly what @psycotiller said with the added thing -- sometimes I'll go around a whole block just to roll up onto the curb rather than get off the board and hop up.  It's ridiculous

Use some freebord bindings and jump up @okp style

That's what I do.  It's really difficult to ride my boards that don't have bindings now that I'm so used to them.  

I'm not great at hopping curbs yet but I'm getting there

If I wasn't afraid of damaging something I'd try to ollie up :P

Seriously though I just follow paths and look for the smooth ways up.

In Los Angeles I try to stay on the road the most of the time but when it's necessary I will go on the streets ,my old wheels 90mm The flywheels clones 80a we're a big pain going through them because I would feel it so hard on my legs but with my 97mm abec 75a duro I berly feel it I slow down and pass thru it sometimes the yellow things have a gap in between them like in the corners u can skim thru most of the times for me
