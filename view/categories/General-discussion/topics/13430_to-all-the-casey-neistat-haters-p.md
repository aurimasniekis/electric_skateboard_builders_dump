Enjoyed his vlogs.  Yep he didn't wear a helmet, but ultimately if you ride it's up to you to decide on your own safety.  Good to see he's wearing one now!

I always hated him but recently i gave him a chance to redeem himself. 
He failed at redemption and now I still hate him...mainly because hes a pompous celebrity that is just paid to advertise things. 
More specifically I ran into him on west side highway while he was jogging and I was riding my diy esk8. 
Saw him eyeing it when he passed me. 
Rode up to him since I thought he was interested in this kind of stuff. 
NOPE he isn't . He signaled to his headphones and told me to go away.  

Maybe he was jealous that he is stuck on a slow ass boosted board

Then maybe he is not interested in esk8s. Maybe it's just very convenient way for him to get to work/wherever. And it stops there. 
I like my bike and use it every day. I hear it's pretty good one, I got it from a friend who didn't need it, so I don't know much about model other that it has 2 wheels and other stuff any bike should have. And it's not broken and I can ride it. But my interest stops there.  
So somebody would say wow you have really cool bike, want to talk about bikes I have a cool bike also. And I would be meh whatever.
Multiply that feeling with celebrity status and constant bugging from random people.

exactly my point. hes a poser and just talks about boosted all the time in his videos (cuz they pay him) when he really doesn't care.

Every random person in the street loves approaching me and talking about my board. I don't shoo them away even though it gets tiring to answer the same questions to everyone. and theses people dont claim to love it all day in their vlogs. but Casey couldn't even be bothered.

Ok, so let's say he is a sell out, but I wouldn't even known that this eskate thing is a thing without seeing it first in his videos. 
And now I'm hooked and here I am deep in DIY plans.
Honestly I really don't care if any of those YT stars get paid for any of that stuff, I mean - good for them. 
I just assume that everything is sponsored.
But sometimes there are some good ideas you can take from the whole concept. 
And I definitely don't blindly go and buy whatever some YTer says it's absolute magic unicorn stuff. That would be like believing those TV ads that this new double triple burger is equally perfectly made IRL.

What ever happened to principles and being a good person...not ok to make a business out of lying to a  loyal fan base. Even if he's feeding his family with it.
Just because some are smart enough to realize/accept the scam doesn't make it ok either.  
The mass media mentality is fucked and everyone seems to be ok with it :frowning:

Wait a second, he's advertising a company, like everybody on the Internet, and not just there, does. You should hate linustechtips and all the other guys with advertising on their videos. If he was reviewing as a good product a shitty Chinese clone I would be upset too, but boosted is actually a good company with the least amount of problems (except last generation's battery problem). It may be overpriced, but if I had the money and wanted a pre-built product boosted would be my first choice anyway. I agree he should have used a helmet from the first day, and he shouldn't drive like that, and he shouldn't drive drones in crowded areas, but you're not going against him for the right reasons. And that "it's paid by the Clintons", you can keep it for yourself. Yes, he may be paid to advertise companies, but when it comes to politics that's pretty much corruption, and don't say that without proof. You don't need to be paid to say anything is better than Trump.

I've always found it odd to say you hate someone you don't know personally (unless they're a proven criminal or something).

Two of Casey's favorite things are drones and e-skate. He's always excited to try out even a non-Boosted board, so he's not just pretending to like them.

Thinking someone is a jerk because he isn't interested in YOUR stuff seems pretty selfish to me. He's a celebrity and a dad, so he could've had any number of reasons to be extremely pressed for time. Or maybe dude's just trying to concentrate on his run. He has mentioned in previous videos that he's sorry for all the many, many people he doesn't get to stop and talk to, and how he's not trying to be rude, but just doesn't always have the time.

Can blame a guy for wanting to take a run in peace. Getting your pace interrupted kinda blows. You me and every other ESK8er probably get a ton of people running up on them asking questions, but for every one person that comes up to one of us, he probably gets a hundred. 

He's stated a number of times that he's not on Boosted's payroll. Either way, Boosted makes some of the best ESK8s on the market, so I can't really find fault with him liking or promoting them. Even if he was getting paid to promote Boosted, what would be wrong with that? It's not like he's out riding some other board while telling everyone how cool Boosted Boards are.

There's things about Casey I don't like, but overall, he's pretty down to earth and a interesting character. It takes some balls to go out in blizzard conditions and get towed by a 4x4 like your wake boarding.

And recently made a video about the new macbooks which I have to say was spot on with how I feel about it.

He may be a bit of a sell out at times, but he says a lot of bad shit about products also. He's usually mostly honest about things...

I admit to being a complete Casey fan boy. I was gutted when he stopped the vlog. 

The thing is he has to make a living. There has to be some way he funds being able to spend all day making a vlog. It is hard work and time consuming. The brand sponsorship along with adsense money makes it viable to produce that content.

Actually I think his personality is pretty much the same on cam as off. And I don't necessarily see him as a typical nice guy, to me he's more like a nice douchebag who sincerely doesn't give a fuck what people think of him, not just pretending, with his wife very much resembling that.
I'm always confused if I should like or dislike him, however his philosophy is a true inspiration to me anyway.

I will never understand why ppl have to make role model out of him or anybody else for that matter. 
You just have to take what he (or anybody else) says and let it simmer in your head for a while and then decide if it's right or important or relevant for and to you. 
I would never take anything for a face value. It's too dangerous and can be significantly misleading.

I've also seen a couple (at least a dozen now) videos of him.. I like how crazy he rides in the streets! 

He is basically passing every car.. and I do wonder how he has got so lucky so far.. not getting side bumped by a car or something.. though, in one video it almost happened.. and he also reported a fall with the board but I did not watch that video yet..

In general, I like his style (like the rest of the 6 Mil subscribers, probably :D

Concerning the advertising of boosted.. at least in the vids I saw.. I've not seen him overly promoting them or giving them attributes which they seemingly dont have.. From the vids it just projects a sense these boards are quite reliable and fast.. Though I think in at least 2 if not more videos, he said he has ran out of battery power.. or that he needs to find a place to charge..(which might project / give off a feeling that the range is seriously lacking.. but hence he does not share distance driven it is hard to guess that..)

It's not hard to pass every car in NYC. I do that pushing. The traffic goes so slow here that it's faster to skate than to drive. The bigger worry than getting bumped by a car is opening doors, taxis, and peds.

I am not a huge Casey Neistat fan, but I will admit he is the reason why I even know esk8 is a thing. I saw him on youtube about a year ago and have been fascinated by the idea ever since. I think he is nuts for driving through all that traffic without a helmet, but I understand why he doesn't. I'm waiting to receive my first esk8, but I never wear a helmet on any other deck because I know how to fall and at this point in my life it's mostly transportation - this old dog isn't trying to learn too many new tricks. I won't take the chance with an electric board because I know increasing speed multiplies the chance that I will eat curb.

I never wore a helmet skating before I took up Esk8. After the first couple days, I picked up a helmet. Everything happens a lot faster on an Esk8. 20+mph on a skateboard is something you have to take seriously. I now wear a helmet whenever I skate. Even though I've never needed a helmet skating before, it only takes once.

Looks bad for the hobby in general if someone who is in the limelight gets hurt.  Also, being a big "YouTube star" means lots of kids looking up to him and want to emulate him end up doing the same thing (see first point).
Also he's riding in a city with lots of potential to get hit by a car and just don't want to see people getting hurt needlessly.

What a silly little conversation. 

People should really mind there own Business and stop playing police. 

If someone is a public person it does not mean he's public property. You may be right when you say as a role model he should wear a helmet but still its his choice. If his viewers copy his behaivior and get hurt, its for some part qlso his fault and he has to deal with it, not you.

And if you may again see a public person and are hurt that he or she has no time for you, just be clear that you are one of the persons in the following photo who take a picture.

And Rude police should play police? 

electric longboards Can be a danger to cars and pedestrians,
Not wearing a helmet can say "I Drive unsafe and I don't even care for my own safety. "

Like there are kids in skate-parks that would be happy to ware helmets but think it is uncool
Because nobody els wares them and then the kid Has a bad fall and gets a concision. 

So yes We should play Police Before the police do there thing.

I really hate the idea of laws specific to esk8.  The end result will be the police checking you out and taxes, that's is bullshit. 

When you guys are talking about what someone should or shouldn't do please please please keep in mind that MAKING someone do something is not ok if what he's doing doesn't hurt you.

Mandated by law and a good idea are two different things.  I think it's a good idea he wears a helmet so the hobby in general doesn't get heavily regulated.  Same issue comes up with quadcopters all the time (Casey or not) with regard to people being reckless with them and then posting that on YouTube... it makes the person posting the video look irresponsible and casts a bad light on everyone in the hobby.  It's not that I want more laws around esk8 or quadcopters it's that I want less.

I wonder...would you have said that about Derek?

Oh, and..I do...I care..hell I even care if you die without a helmet on, because the "i told you so" to parents and friends is damn painful...

I brought up something to help get my point across and maybe if enough people started doing the same the point would be fucking heard and people would stop dying because it would mean facing the reality of the situation. As a trainer I use tools like that to create teachable moments, your feedback is just telling me it worked and let's hope is reaches the wider audience too. You can criticize my methods and me too if you wish, but as you have shown, it works as intended.. We lose eskaters all the time, we lost one in the bay area last month, dead. I guess the posts about dead skaters will become more the norm than people reminding others to stay safe because they are all afraid of what now? being cheap? is that what you called it...then by all means, I'm cheap as hell dude, I'll take it..but I'm not going to beat around the bush, people who ride eskates without a helmet are playing with fire...it's not a preference thing, it's a "hey you're a dumbass" and I think that each and every time I see someone riding near 30mph without a helmet on, I'm just honest enough to say it...how about everyone do that and maybe we'll see less deaths as the hobby grows..tough situations require tough talk..I'll jump on this grenade with a smile dude..and done cheaply..lol because ain't nobody got time for funerals...I would rather be riding..

Actually, i'm fairly certain that there is a magic number of people dying on record while not wearing helmets that will eventually draw the attention of the lawmakers. Everything is a number. To be clear, in America, lives don't matter nearly as much as they do in Europe and Canada. People in America are far more focused on themselves than those around them in general here. 

For example, it took three lives to build a traffic signal at one intersection of my home town, and two lives to put up a stop sign on another less busy road. Vast swaths of Europe don't even use signals because those people aren't as selfish and stupid as we are, yet in America we not only have to have them, we have a specific number of deaths per region we use in order to deem them necessary because we're too preoccupied with the cost of the intersections that we'll just see if anyone dies and look at it later instead of just building a fucking light. 

So it's not "until somebody dies", no. Its far more sinister and cold than that. A certain value of death must be achieved in total, meaning more of your friends have to die senselessly before anything will be done. 

this is why @mmaner  's personal liberties matter so much. You see, he has a right to be one of those numbers. So do i. But when three people made the same decision and died in my little home town, the crowd decided that maybe those weren't the right decisions and put up a signal. In retrospect. Because people complained about people dying, and they were forced to do so because of complaints. Not even the dying, but the complaints of the dying. Did i mention i hate this fucking country?

who knows how many people will die before esk8s are classified and catalogged and ruled on. Nationally we've already had hundreds, even thousands die already i'm sure. two just on this forum in the time i've been here, and you clowns definitely aren't everyone. The police are already learning to common sense the situation by suggesting widely accepted procedures and generally treating them like bicycles in the absence of law in my area.

@squishy654 if your comfortable impinging on another person's rights, then go for.  Anyone with so little love for personal freedom is not going to be talked out of it.  I do not disagree with the sentiment, I disagree that you have the moral authority or obligation to MAKE someone do something that YOU don't like.

Holy shit...  I wear a helmet, but WTF...why do you think you have the right to TELL me anything.  I'm a grown man, I make my own decisions, and I live or die with the consequences.  Everyone should have the right to go to hell however they wanna without everyone that thinks they know more than the guy with 2 degrees and 37 certifications and a frikkin lifetime of experience.

I use peer pressure, nothing more, I'm not advocating for regulations or laws, I'm advocating that this community speak up like it has a pair, and instead of arguing about it use your passion to tell and teach and spread a culture that changes these problems for the better...True you cannot force a culture to change, no matter how badly you wish it, it wil never happen...the culture needs to want to change..I am not implying we infringe on anyone's personal rights, I'm implying we all speak up, and challenge each other to be safer and create a culture together where safety is a main concern and maybe we can TOGETHER stop the deaths..I realize it appears heavy handed or personal, but it's not...I am communicating what I feel is the only way it will change, and that's if all of you wish it too!

Im diggin that through and through.  One of the things I always argue when speaking on the topic of personal liberties is "the price of democracy is listening to other peoples crap because they have to listen to yours".  BUT, and this is big ass, overweight fat as a whale BUT, how many times does it have to be said?

I would wager that 99.999999999999% of the people on this forum (that leaves yous pinky toe out of the loop @longhairedboy :) ) don't know that its safer to wear a helmet and that you always should?  My issue is that most of the time when it comes up its not a suggestion with a clear and clinical statement as to why you should wear a helmet, its a "You wear helmet, I said so, you stupid if you think ANYTHING else" kind of statement.

I agree with your statement earlier, life is less precious in the US than in most European nations.  The other side of that is personal freedoms are more important in the US than in most European nations, at least is used to be and I'm acting on the premise that it still is.  I try not to be the ALWAYS & NEVER guy, life isn't black & white and neither are these issues.  But I will always push back when someone says I HAVE to do something because they think I should.

Calling "mandates and proposing new governance and enforcement" a caring act to help save lives is BS of the worst kind.  Do I agree you and I should both wear helmets everytime we skate, sure I do.  I might even say "Damon, thats a dumbass thing to do, not wearing a helmet.  You wanna borrow one?"  What I won't say is "Damon, thats a dumbass thing to do, not wearing a helmet.  Im gonna get a law passed to MAKE you wear a helmet".

Its all good, just a healthy debate.  All I'm saying is that you absolutely have the right to say it, but everytime you say it you give some dogooder twat the idea to start looking into legislation.  When you say it here, on the internet, your saying a million time, over and over again, every time someone sees it.  Is it really necessary for 50 people to say it 50 times each?

I just find it mind boggling that a bunch of skaters are debating whether people should be made to do something...Glen Danzig and Henry Rollins would not be proud :slight_smile:.

That's the entire point, I DO understand where my liberties end and how my actions affect other people.  The issue is that you don't seem to care about anyone else's liberties than your own.  I dont give a damn about "interfering" with you, what I care about is when you "STOP" me from doing some action that doesnt hurt you because you think I should.

But I'll follow you down the rabbit hole...
So I'm out skating and I fall and crack my head open, obviously I wasn't wearing a helmet.  This sparks a shit storm of unrest amoong the populace and resentment of the citizenry at large.  6 months to a a year later a bunch of new laws are enacted that effectively eliminate eskateing as a legal sport.  Does that mean I am the cause of that legislation?  

No sir, it does NOT.  I did not ask for laws, I was not given the option to vote on those laws, I never once uttered anything resembling support for those laws...but in your short sightedness you blame me.  The true culprit here is the citizenry that believe it has the right and obligation to stop people from doing things that might hurt them, AKA you.

I would ask this question of you, do YOU want any laws that stop **YOU** from doing something, or do you just want to stop me from doing something?

I repeat...I wear a helmet and I make my kid wear a helmet, but its none of your business.

They are in the progress of making regulations of e-skates so they can legally be driven on public roads here in Denmark. As it is right now, it does not seem that any safety gear, including helmets, will be mandatory. The argument for that is that safety gear is not imposed when biking. So they suggests that the same should concern e-skating. 

I am personally mixed about it. I actually thinks it would make sense to make an helmet mandatory when e-skating on public road. Helmets are mandatory when riding a moped. 

It is always difficult finding the right relationship between regulations and peoples liberty rights. 

Sometimes regulations can shift the awareness of a whole generation. When they ban smoking inside in restaurants and bars a decade ago, that law met huge resistance. Now almost no one thinks that law is stepping to far. 

I think an official statement through law about helmets would help emphasize how a seriously good idea it is wearing one :) 

Fortunately it seems that regulations are not essential for making this shift of awareness. When I was growing up, I flew around doing whatever without a helmet. Nowadays I rarely see any kid biking without a helmet and my kids would never sit on a bike without one. Of course you wear a helmet when biking. What a huge change of awareness made without regulation, but with information campaigns. Adults are slowly getting there as well, but not in the same numbers as the small ones. But despite that I am still for a mandatory helmet when skating and biking for that matter. We also have to wear seatbelts when driving :)

Huh? You heard "We need to regulate helmet use" from all that? really dude? alright...

What I said was it isn't preference as to whether it's smart, cool or stupid to where a helmet, it's factually stupid..so you cannot argue, "well it's just preference" because it shouldn't be, it should be judged for what it is..unsafe, reckless, ignorant and those people die (regularly)..did I say in there anywhere we should force anyone to do anything? I said we should just speak up, like I am doing, and you are not forced to read this.

I mentioned laws and regulations because people who never wear them, become statistics which effect regulations, forcing everyone to comply..so in effect, I am actually pointing out how others are forcing or effecting me and us...not the other way around..

I understand logic perfectly, and I feel you have mis-read or wish to misread what I'm saying...I won't advocate for regulations, rules are only meant to be broken...Hell, I'm not even forcing you to read it either, I was gonna give you that one but damn dude...you are really putting a lot of meaning into my words when I believe it's the syntax you have issue with...don't confuse my message with my tone..My message is simple: "everyone here should start advocating more helmet use and hold each other to a higher standard, take it or leave it, or you will be regulated by ignoring this problem and letting governance do it for you"...if you don't wish too, if you disagree and wish to advocate for no helmets and freedom and "no one should look out for anyone else" then by all means, argue it, own it but don't put words in my mouth, I'm happy to reiterate them in many forms till your reading comprehension catches up...

I am wise enough to understand you cannot make anyone do anything they do not wish too...this is why peer pressure works..this is how not wearing a helmet became cool, peer pressure, I suggest we use it in the other direction...I think wearing a helmet is cool, and smart too...and I wish to pass on the message without people in these forums stating "who cares if someone dies?!" or "STOP TRYING TO FORCE PEOPLE TO WEAR HELMETS!"  well, I'll be your huckleberry...I care if someone dies and I'm not forcing, I'm just reminding so you dread that terrible day I am forced to say "I told you so"..and I will remind you of your dead friends if you don't get the point, because it's an important point..this isn't about regulations or forcing people to do shit..its your attitudes regarding helmets that is indirectly the cause of future deaths, while reminding people and creating a culture of people who care, saves lives. This is a dangerous culture...that's been proven through the deaths..if someone reminding you of this is so painful you guys choke on the conversation and attack the messenger then you have a much worst problem that I could even perceive right now and the number of deaths will teach people in-time..no reply, no reminder, no "I told you so..." will bring someone back from the dead...so it starts now, while you can still talk to them...

Well you could slip on it and hurt yourself of course...

My friend left a giant blood stain in the street outside my house, it was actually painful to see each day going to work, the sounds of his crash haunt me, the crunching and scraping and the sounds of him dislocating both arms still runs through my brain and makes me cringe. And he was wearing a helmet..



By the way, I park skate and ride transition and I don't wear a helmet when I do...never have in 30 years of skating...but I never step on a eskate without a helmet now..I know better...and the people who know better up in these forums should not be afraid of saying so anymore..we need to stand up to the arguments...MAKE HELMETS COOL AGAIN!! or something...besides they offer more room for stickers! and look way better than your head does, when sliding on the pavement...

FACT: When you understand the dangers of riding a eskate, not wearing a helmet is a dumb idea.

If you have a problem with my approach, then speak to it, all you have done is distract and redirect and I love a good debate, but you are not debating, you are simply trying to put me down, and that's fine, but maybe start another thread or something, it's off topic..

Once again, for the 10th time...I don't disagree, maybe if I say I agree that will make more sense.  Im not trying to put you down, I'm trying to say that your approach is crap, I've said it 20 different ways and you keep defending against it and throwing insults.  I've got a wife and 3 daughters, insults just slide off my back, but saying the same thing 20 different ways is taxing.

> peer pressure works

Its manipulative and doesn't rely on facts or logic, so its not respectable.

[quote="squishy654, post:105, topic:13430"]
I mentioned laws and regulations because people who never wear them, become statistics which effect regulations, forcing everyone to comply…so in effect, I am actually pointing out how others are forcing or effecting me and us…not the other way around…
[/quote]

Now that I can debate.  

1.  Say what you wanna say, then move on.  Your approach is very authoritative, meaning "I said it so you gotta do it or everyone in the whole frikkin world will think your a dumbass because I'm never wrong".

2.  There is an argument that boards going no faster than 7 miles an hour pose less danger than walking, there are stats that prove the hypothesis.  If I can get my hands on them Ill post them here.  That is, IN FACT, an instance where a law regulating the use of helmets and electric skateboards is not warranted.

3.  THe entire round robin approach is a fallacy, you cannot prove a negative with a double negative.  Hypothetically that like saying you want helmet regulations so people don't get hurt which would create an incentive for helmet regulation.

> everyone here should start advocating more helmet use

I don't get this.  If you actually feel so strongly that you would tell a bunch of strangers that they should be doing something, when you've got no reason to think we don't, and that your so sure your right then go lobby about it, get some signs made, hell start selling helmets.  

I have yet to read any statement you've made as a suggestion.  I agree, in most cases people should be wearing helmets while on a skateboard.  BUT there are exceptions and there is, MOST IMPORTANTLY, the right of people to make their own decisions.  Maybe try seeing that some dude out there might have a valid reason for not wearing a helmet, one that you dont know about or understand, because you haven't asked.  You've only said...

[quote="squishy654, post:105, topic:13430"]
it isn’t preference as to whether it’s smart, cool or stupid to where a helmet, it’s factually stupid…so you cannot argue, “well it’s just preference” because it shouldn’t be, it should be judged for what it is…unsafe, reckless, ignorant and those people die (regularly)

Yeah, what you hear and what I say are two different things, thanks for giving an example of that. I've actually asked others to repeat the message, solely because we are all human, I'm not perfect, but a collective cultural message, is powerful, much more powerful than one person (me) saying it, but you missed that part? I see you are in fact stuck on my tone, that's fine, cannot please everyone...but I'm not going to change for any one either, so if you wish to keep pointing it out, cool..says more about you than me though..

Maybe some people need some authoritative tone from a 40 year old skater to get the fucking point? Maybe they need to be reminded that people are dying. Maybe peer pressure is the only thing which effects or changes the behaviors of certain demographics? I already explained why these less than desirable methods are now the only effective means left to solve the problem. It's because people keep arguing or looking for something to argue against (in your case, tone). I think my audience heard my message...you just go on and hear what you wish, lol. You're still cool though..I understand my tone rubs people, if you wish to start a thread about it feel free, but it's not a very interesting topic. If I speak like I know what I'm talking about, I do apologize, I am sorry such things bother so you much, try thicker skin?

Peer pressure isn't any more manipulative than say, trying to actively change a culture... lol HAHAHAHAHA yes it is purposefully manipulative, good observation...that's the whole point...because at this point it's the only thing which effectively manipulates the culture..good word, thanks for that..and it's not a bad word in this case, it's not a negative trait of the method, it's reflective of it's effectiveness actually, in manipulating the culture to changing for the better. Actually thanks for that word, it may help someone else reading this to understand why I say peer pressure is the only thing which works, because it's currently the only thing that works, as you are displaying by replying and trying to convince me or the audience (through peer pressure) that I am saying: "I said it so you gotta do it or everyone in the whole frikkin world will think your a dumbass because I’m never wrong"...like that right?

Yes a fine example...peer pressure, when it comes down to it, is the only thing which changes people's minds..I don't debate for sport dude..I debate to teach..my tone is a training method based on adult learning theory, because I know none of you guys will ever learn a thing unless you want too...your resistance to accepting me and my message, is you not wishing to learn, being unwilling to compromise and meet half way...you agree with the message, yet you continue to reply and debate the tone or method of stating that message, to the point you say it's completely ineffective and pointless to attempt...I disagree, for I am not really ever replying to you, I am using your replies to teach the audience..if you have no desire to learn how peer pressure teaches, then I can never teach it to you...I accept that...but I bet there's others here who understand this perfectly...they will get an "ahhh haaa" moment and realize that if we see people riding without helmets, we shouldn't be afraid to speak up and point it out and speak to it, and all those who get that should back each other up and not allow people to railroad the conversations because they dislike the painful methods of culture change which are similar to pulling teeth...no it isn't pleasant, it's not always nice words, peer pressure can sometime be a real bitch...but it works, trust me...or prove me wrong and use it and display it failing for me...show me someone telling another in this community they should be wearing a helmet and something terrible coming from it...it's not like we're talking about being a dick (although I know you are wishing that's what I would say, lol)...we're talking about a little pressure from your peers..."like hey dude. you should wear a helmet before you jump on that and test ride it"..."but it's just a short test" .....CRASH...and then he's dead...pressure isn't forcing, it's nudging or influencing...through tiny acts, like not saying "who cares if he dies"..that would be a good place to start...how about starting by stopping saying certain things, instead of interaction, maybe interaction is a little advanced just yet, lol

OK, I'm gonna summarize.  

1.  Should people wear a helmet when skating?  Probably.
2.  Do you, or anyone have the right or authority to tell me or anyone that we have to or we're idiots?  F#$K NO!
3.  You think peer pressure, you label not mine, is OK.  I think its manipulative and dishonest.

Lastly I will ask you to think about something...

Suppose you convince people its mandatory to wear a helmet.  Not entirely a bad thing, but it makes it easier people to be lead by the nose next time, instead of thinking for themselves.  Using pear pressure, whether it achieves your goal or not, is manipulative and falling into the trap "the ends justify the means" is slippery and leads to bad things.

Do you attack Evolve marketing for being greedy/transparent/manipulative? in literally trying to get you to buy one?

Do you attack all the kids on the play ground when they make fun of your red hotwheel car when everyone knows the green one is the coolest this week? or do you just go out and get a fucking green hotwheel car too? 

I am curious if you attack anything manipulative (commercials, your parents, your friends, teachers, your boss, marketing media) with as much vigor as you are bringing to this convo, because if you do...there's some spam on fb from all those eskate companies that need your attention...listen dude, it could be argued that communication itself, language itself is manipulative, but your generalizing and going down a slippery slope...when your kid runs out into a parking lot, do you yell stop, and manipulate the situation? You sure do..HOW DARE YOU BE SO manipulative!! See what I'm saying here? Manipulation isn't a bad thing, it may be a hard thing to understand, but it's happening right now right here, as you try to convince me of something, and I try to convince you...just because something is manipulative, doesn't mean it's inherently a bad thing...I am curious why you would believe that ...while I sort of get it, you are getting stuck up on the words themselves, there is negative connotation to the word manipulation from your perspective, while I generalize the term "manipulation" could mean anything, including what my tools do to screws...omg HOW DARE THEY!!! 

What options would you propose in place of peer pressure to spread awareness about helmet use?

Get companies to spend money on lame info campaigns, make pamphlets?

We cannot just give up and ask our governance to regulate it, we covered that already and that would suck.

We could, mmmmm...what? What would you call it?

Like if there were people we wouldn't need to worry about it would be professionals in fire and rescue, lol, but no, they are still human and forgetful and complacency, I...my buddies and I give each other some serious shit for leaving helmets in the car or at home..in fact I leave my remote in my helmet, they are always together so I don't forget and I can avoid ever being reminded or forced to make excuses...it just works, leave your remote laying in your helmet, always grab both......also group rides...organizers should make helmets mandatory for all group rides...pretty simple really...and it's not like they are forcing you to wear wrist guards and get a mullet...lol they just don't want to ruin the group ride by having to stop a mile in to call a coroner...

I don't know what words would sell helmet usage best,  I don't try to sell ideas.  In fact, I don't sell anything really, I couldn't sell heaters to an eskimo, just don't have the skill set.  What I do have is an impeccable sense and understanding of logic.  I would rely on logic and examples to achieve this goal.  

As far as commercials, parents, etc.  I only like Super Bowl commercials and ads about @longhairedboy Mom , and I only watch them on YouTube or RedTUbe :slight_smile: .  For the most part commercials are a non-starter for me.  My Dad never, that I remember or can imagine, tried to manipulate me into an action.  He explained the facts and consequences and left me to make a decisions and the consequences were mine.  So do I like attempts at manipulating me?  I think you can guess the answer at this point :slight_smile: 

When you are defining a type of speech with the word "Manipulation" its almost always a bad thing.  I'm not talking about manipulating a torx bolt or fiber mesh.  Im talking about using a person's emotions to drive them to a specific action, that is bad...at least in this instance.

I got hit by a minivan on my bike in the 5th grade. Went through the windshield partially and flew 20ish feet. I was told in the hospital that my helmet, specifically Roces aggressive skate helmet saved my life and even with a standard bike helmet I might be a vegetable today. A family friend was a Roces rep at the time and they sent me a brand new helmet in exchange for mine that they then used for marketing in Italy (or that was the story they told me). I'd have to be really stupid not to wear one on anything with wheels.
