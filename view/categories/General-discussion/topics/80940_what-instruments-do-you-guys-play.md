Okay guys in all seriousness.
I do think this is an appropriate topic. I would love to talk music tech with a lot of you guys and know what everyone's talents are.
I'm disappointed this thread didn't already exist.
Ill give @Allofyoush a pass on this one. 
Let's get back on the op topic, when I get home I'll take some pictures of my instruments

Well traditional ukes were gut strings, they were built for the softness of fingers. You loose so many playing dynamics when you go to a pick/plektrum. Mark Knopfler calls the pick ‚Äúthe worst guitar amplifier ever‚Äù

 I just pointed it out because I could see a pick holder on the Uke which I personally think is strange.

Yep, my disgust was pointed towards the OP who put a damn puck holder on a uke, AND he put it on the top...even worse. It‚Äôs degrading to the instrument. Should just use it as a coaster.

Yeah and you don't have like something against people who use picks while playing electric guitar solos fast right?

I mean if you mastered your hammer ons and pulloffs then maybe you could make your lefthand/chord hand (for standard guitars) do most of the work.

I'm a beginner at Uke, so the pick helps me learn. And it's like a $50 instrument for absolute beginners. Not too worried about the possibility of residue on the wood.

Picks have their place. They are a tool that the musicians uses to make their art.

I use a pick on all my guitars but I also use my fingers!

@Allofyoush it‚Äôs not a residue issue, you put it on the top, that‚Äôs like the diaphragm of the instrument. That top piece of wood gets vibrated by the strings attaching directly to the bridge and helps shape the tone of the instrument.

Since it‚Äôs a beginner uke, it‚Äôs probably a laminate and not solid wood so I‚Äôll give you a pass.

5 String - this is my everyday player

4 String Uke Bass - yes that‚Äôs a thing

4 String piccolo bass


I also have a Strat and a custom Taylor, but my main focus is bass.

And who could forget the community service group that I started where we build guitars and then donate them to schools who need them:

@eb1925 @mmaner We need to meet up with @Sender in Birmingham one night and ride to find some live music!

I heard @eb1925 is a poet on the Meat Flute, and I look forward to enjoying his performance.

Thanks! In just one day, you guys quadrupled the number of like(s) I received in the last three years. I'm touched. I think I'll have to implement some new DAVEga feature for you tonight. :smiley:

You will see..... Benjamin has re-written tons of VESC-Tool code and Vesc-Tool-Mobile code. 
Everything is now a lot more simple. Most setups are now a single click only. On top of that new, astonishing features will get available.  The speaker driver is just a gimmick. It's quite amazing though.
