They‚Äôre probably li ion, but probably not good quality, and it wouldn‚Äôt make sense to spend the time or money buying these, just buy a prebuilt or spend more time researching

Judging by that pic, they're probably bottom heavy üòÅ

It won't be 128 volts. Thats for sure.
It's been done with a better quality battery before.

if my maths is right, you'd need about 35 liion cells in series, and I'll be fucked if there's a single cell that's 10000mah

It'd have to be a 35S1P and there's no way a 10Ah 35S battery could fit in that enclosure.  I call bullshit.

It's Marketing Jive because people buy it when the voltage number is bigger.  So they print bigger voltage numbers, regardless of what's inside.  Because that's what moves shit off the shelf.

If you can change out the batteries then it might be viable , saw a guy on Facebook who made a pretty clean looking build with two on. I believe he did it for the swap ability factor , let‚Äôs see if I can find him.

In all seriousness though, I'd open up that enclosure to harvest those 3500+ liions and start selling cheap cells on here.

Cheap cells sell on reddit or that facegram thing.  On here, it's gotta be the real deal

You really got to stop making a thread for everyrhing. Just stick to this with all your questions about the board. 

Youre going to need about 4or5 of those 18v packs to hit the range yoo want.
