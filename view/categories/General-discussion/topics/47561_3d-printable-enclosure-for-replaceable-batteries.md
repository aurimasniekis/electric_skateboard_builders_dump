Is there any 3D printable enclosures out there that can fit two 4s 5000mah batteries, and can quickly open in order to replace the batteries? I have a pretty janky enclosure and would very much like to have a cleaner looking board that can show off the decals on the bottom of the deck!

Edit: forgot to mention the batteries are lipo packs
