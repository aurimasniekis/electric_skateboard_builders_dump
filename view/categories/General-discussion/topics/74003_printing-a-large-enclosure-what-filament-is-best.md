My enclosure is approx. 550mm long and 250mm wide. 
Is 100% Infill PLA the best option? or should I print with another material, such as ABS, Nylon, PETG, etc?
I have a bad feeling that PLA will just crack after a week or so of use.
Does anyone have any experience with this? 
Thanks.

I highly recommend that you use abs or petg at least, stronger materials if you can afford them. I used ASA-X, an abs-polycarbonate filament. Very strong and weather resistant too.
 Pla has much less heat resistance and this could cause you problems on a hot day.
