Hey

Lately anytime I have a high amp draw situation (full throttle on hills usually) my vescs will shut down.  First one then the other. R spec mode I can get it to cut out on bench testing.

I thought maybe it was a receiver issue but I just swapped one out and same issue.  Also tried making sure the battery wasn't the culprit so I fully charged it and same issue.

Starting to lean towards anti spark switch from the reading I've done but my battery display never shuts down when it cuts out.  I just have to let off the throttle then reapply and slowly roll into the pull.

You figure it out?  My bolt motion board does the same thing on full throttle and I'm not sure what I should adjust to improve it.
