so a question ive been wondering about for a while about these group rides mostly for these large ones with over 20-50 people maybe even more i have heard of. are there designated safety officers or anyone with safety training to assist the injured. only just recently i have put a first aid kit in my backpack to keep with me at all times due to my latest incident where i chopped my finger up and didnt have anything with me so a nice puddle of blood on my walk home i left behind for over 1km but at least now i feel prepared for it. 

Please let me know of your thoughts or if this is already a thing during these rides. and yes i take safety very seriously as i have had my fair share of experiences.
