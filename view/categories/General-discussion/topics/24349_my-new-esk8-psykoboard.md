video looks well done - are you a film student or trying to kickstarter it?

Specs?  Motor / batteries and range / gearing and speed?

My only critique would be to more smoothly integrate the box underneath.  More organic curves to match the board symmetry?

What's the board made of - any function of the downturn nose/tail besides aesthetics?

Welcome!

watched a related video on youtube.

indiegogo project (didn't search to find page), 16-18mi range claimed, 25mph, all carbon autoclaved deck, dual hub motors, 2 speed BT controller.

Good luck Christian and team!

Looks good, only one problem, you will get almost no pop with your tail and nose upside down like that, just a thought :wink:.

Yeah, nice eagle, bro.

Here is OP's IndieGoGo link: https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/psykoboard-the-raptor-eye-electric-lifestyle#/
Looks a lot cleaner than the majority of IGG campaigns. Good luck, Psykoboard!

This looks very similar to landwheel... just with some stickers on it... that's a shame.

Same with remote:

Even with the deck being CF and made in italy - if the electronics are landwheel - that's a big letdown for this price.

@Psykoboard - can you comment?

I thought it would cost something like 400usd but 1299usd. It's way too much for those weird looking deck tails.
