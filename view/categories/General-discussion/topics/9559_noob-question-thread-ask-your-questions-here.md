Sure, I'll bite.

Been reading a lot but there is still a ton I don't know. Looking for assistance on what to buy. The big items are fairly easy to figure out. What about the smaller items. The right gauge wires, connectors, heat tube, spark suppressors, some switch thingy with a key in it. A list of the little things that no build can do without.

You should simply need to wire the key switch to the same places as the included switch. You'll also need a key switch that will allow you to remove the key in the on position, so that the key is easier to keep track of.

Question Part A: Hub vs Geared/Pulley motors. I love the idea and look of Hub, take up way less space and are simpler to deal with it seems, but the majority of builds still seem to be using geared/pulley, which I've seen people say is because you get more customization. What is better for what situations?

I personally do not need more than 20mph, I'm building on a penny. 18mph is my preferred top speed (beyond that is too unstable for my liking), but I also need to be able to tackle 10-13 % grade hills. 

Question Part B: With that said, it seems as though lower kV is considered better for hill climbing (something like 85kV), but the majority of people seem to be using 200-300kV motors. 

My ideal solution would give me 15-18mph top speed, ~12% grade hill capabilities, ~2-4 mile ride time min (I don't need distance as much as the other 2 factors). 

I've been doing calculations for days and still am not sure if I need to get 2 motors and whether i'd be better off with pulley or if I can go hub (pref, because awesome) and which kV of a motor I need, and how many cells in parallel and series I'd need to run it properly.

If anyone can give me insight into any aspect of this, that would be amazing.

I received my four 3S1P lipos today and the first thing I did was measuring the voltage of each cell with my "düwi digital multimeter". One of them was actually perfectly balanced at 3.76V, two others had   3.7±0.15V which is okay I guess. The last one though... it had one cell at 2.27V and from what I've read that's critical. 
Is the dealer supposed to take them back or is it normal that lipo's are unbalanced when they arrive?

Lipo's:
1 - 3.76V 3.76V 3.75V
2 - 3.69V 3.76V 3.88V
3 - 3.92V 3.76V 3.79V
4-  3.73V 2.26V 3.45V

Thats really critical. When Lipos get shipped they are at arround 3.7V for better storage! I would return this battery because it is already faulty and will make more and more problems. It can even fire itself...

Hello all!

I have a simple (or I assume it is at least) question that I'm having a super hard time finding an answer for online. I'm a big, fat dude. 6'2" 350+lbs. I want to ride an electric board but I'm having a rough time finding information about which board would best suit me. I reached out to the Boosted Board people and they told me they've had people my size ride their boards but they had to have a wider stance (I assume just over the wheels). Most other manufacturers stick around the 250lbs range. So I started wondering about diy kits.

Would any of you fine folks be able to suggest a solution for me? I used to skate a lot when I was younger so I'm used to the regular sized boards, I even still have my old Corey O'Brian deck from the late 80's lol. I'm totally open to a longboard experience though. Honestly, whichever handles my weight better and can run a dual motor as I'm assuming I'd need the extra juice to get around.

Thanks so much!
Jamie

Look, noob here too, but I've been reading A LOT! 

I'd suggest the Metroboard Dual drive,  or the Ollin Freeride Board.  They are the Two most robust and powerful pre-built boards out there. (Street setups) 

However, this being esk8 builders, you can build just as powerful yourself. Keep reading here.  There's TONS of info!

you will want a 36/14 pulley gearing ratio. buy either [this](diy-electric-skateboard-kits-parts/36t-abec-drive-pulley-belt-combo-kit/) or [this](http://www.enertionboards.com/electric-skateboard-parts/12mm-wide-pulley-drive-hub-kit/)
motor mounts depend on the trucks you use. I would go with caliber trucks and get either [this](http://www.enertionboards.com/electric-skateboard-parts/carbon-fiber-motor-mount-enertion/) or [this](diy-electric-skateboard-kits-parts/single-bolt-on-motor-mount-only/)
get either a 170kv, 190kv, or 149kv motor. higher kv = more speed but less torque.

Hybrid in what sense? Have 1 motor run sensored while the other motor doesn't? Or do you mean hybrid mode in the VESC. When I say you should use sensors, I mean you should use hybrid mode if you have a VESC.

If you're using a car ESC, running sensors at high speeds is inefficient and leaves your motors pretty toasty. I'd recommend running sensorless if you're using a standard car ESC.

Specifically to the Maytech VESC, it's not that much cheaper and there's been some bad feedback with them.

Many non genuine parts, caps values lower than specified by Vedder, bad solder joints, non working bootloader, FW containing max ramp step bug. 

Those 2 VESCs have been delivered last week directly from the factory in China. Not matching their claims for quality at all.

that should probably work if you just use it for your esc, just don´t use it to break the battery circuit!
also you should maintain the calibrate button, because you´ll probably lose connection a few times, that´s when you´ll need it ;)

Thanks for all the reply and concerns as to what I'm doing with the switch.. Now my question remains, how do I wire this up? x) Thanks 

Ignore my previous question of 4 prongs, the one I just ordered is 5 prong and this is what it looks like.

The 12v battery is only to power the LED on the switch. (NOT FOR THE ESC AT ALL)

I am certainly not sure if my explanation is correct... I just got told that it should work like this.

When i try out a switch i dont solder the cables in the beginning. i just hold the cables against the prongs and test it out. when i have the desired wiring i will solder it for the longterm.

I see.. However, you said that the battery goes straight to + and - but wouldn't that just keep the switch LED ON all the time? I think one of the positive or negatives of the battery leads should go into another so that when the button is pressed in, only then will the LED turn on.

With 2 of this battery:

(Or this but more expensive:)
https://www.hobbyking.com/en_us/multistar-high-capacity-6s-20000mah-multi-rotor-lipo-pack.html

Together with this esc:
http://www.voelkner.de/products/182335/Roxxy-Blcontrol-9100-12-Opto.html

With 170 kv 3200w Motors

Do you guys think this will work well?
I never used Lipos and im a bit afraid of them :sweat_smile:

This thread is just perfect for this questions. No need to start a new thread everytime someone has just a small question like this.

I would expect 20 miles with the 15000mAh battery, and 25 miles with the 20000mAh. It is best to get a genuine iMax B6, so [this.](https://www.amazon.com/Genuine-SKYRC-Power-6Amps-50Watts/dp/B00ND7J38C) It's the V2, so you can plug straight into the wall. Much better than the alternatives.

I just got my VESC from Alien Power Systems (the flier model) without realizing that it may not be programmed. Is this true, does it have no firmware or do I just need to update the firmware? Does anyone have any tips on what should do to if it has no firmware? I read somewhere that Linux is required to upload the firmware to the VESC, but I run Windows 10. Any help would be really appreciated.

## \#81 Posted by: TarzanHBK Posted at: 2016-11-08T08:00:17.866Z Reads: 503

depends. 
If you´re going up a reaaaaally steep hill and you´re batteries and esc is able to provide the full amount of energy you´re motor is capable of, it will pull as much as it can. 
So if you got a 3000W motor and 6s you´ll be able to pull 135A theoretical. Should be a bit less in reality.
Watt = Amps x Volts (1s = 3,7V Lipo)
That´s your formula to work with to get your max Amps

Here's a question. Lets say (somewhat real numbers here but disregard the accuracy - lets keep this theoretical) Im riding a 9s, 245KV with a vesc at 30mph. Hnece ERPM is around 55000, close to the 60000 max but still safe. I then start to ride down a hill, still full throttle. Speed picks up to 40mph.

What now? I this dangerous for the VESC? Is the current draw higher? If using a car ESC instead of a VESC would it have a different effect/ be more/less damaging? 

The basic question is: If i'm travelling above the max speed my board can reach itself, would this be a problem?

So I got my Flier model VESC but I noticed that on the capacitor board, the red wire was leading the the negative and black to positive. I'm no electronics expert, but I know that red is usually positive and black is negative/ground. I haven't powered the VESC yet, but I want to know if the capacitor board is the wrong way around or if it doesn't matter.

Question: I am installing a VESC to my Magneto 1 (backfire) 
I am setting up the voltage cut offs and i wonder **how many cells my battery is**? 
And what cutoff levels i should go for.

I see 5 white, 1 black wire on the balancing wires, is that 6 cell? 
Can you tell from that? Pictures: http://imgur.com/a/Ga338

If it's 6 cell im thinking going for 
6 Cell x 3,4V = 20,4V for cutoff start and
6 Cell x 3,2V = 19,2V cutoff end, or could i go lower than 3,2V?﻿

How much does the discharge rate ( max continues) matter - Most people I see use the Samsung 18650-25r 20A batteries but when looking at some E-bikes I see that they contain Samsung 18650 5A batteries instead? 

is 5A to low for a E-board and if so why does it differ from the bikes?

Got another question regarding 18650 batteries and soldering them, I see that some companies, NKON for example offer to solder U / Z soldering tags on the batteries before they ship them.
The strips on the tags diemensions: 30x7x0.12mm.

Isnt it a possibility to decrease the heat transfered to the given cell that you get thoose tags and solder onto the tags and somewhat decrease the possiblity of heat getting into the battery?

For someone wihtout a Spotwelder this would be as soild idea? or is the tags themself gonna heat up when battery is in action due to being to thin?

I'm working on my first build and I'm on the smaller side. 5'5 120lbs female. I bought 2 6s 20c 3000mah lipo batteries and am really curious as to how to set them up. I actually bought some hub motors 70mm off an ebuilder on here. I'm a noob but I've literally read over 12 hours worth of these forums so far according to the site.

oh shit didnt notice there's a stupid questions thread, here goes;

i'm seeing all these premade LiPo cells floating around on hobbyking like zippys, how hard are those to put integrate into a BMS? like say if i got three 10S 30C packs to make a 10s3p....how hard would it be to slap a BMS on them?

and would you have one BMS per pack, or one for the whole thing?

In series that would be 12s 3000mah.  In parallel it would be 6s 6000mah.  I would suggest parallel, would give you a lower top speed and longer ride time, at least until you get used to it.

There's a section for builds, browse it and you will see what people have done I. The past that has been successful.

watt hours is a better indicator
you get watt hours by multiplying the total pack voltage (6s is 6x3.6= if you're using lipos, 21.6 volts) by the amp hours (6000mah is 6ah) to get watt hours. and 10 watt hours roughly equals 1km of range

so! assuming the cells are all 3000mah individually...
6s4p is 21.6volts x (3Ah x 4parallel) = 21.6x12 = 259 watt hours = ~25km range
6s3p is 19.4km
6s2p is 12.9km
6s1p is 6.4km

Series will add the voltage, parallel will add the amp hours and discharge rate. For the VESC higher voltages are definitely recommended depending on your kV, and hub motors generally have issues with heat dissipation so raising the voltage should lower the amps and heat, however how heat in a motor is generated seems to be debatable.

In series you would have 12S * 3Ah = 133.2Wh with 20C discharge and in parallel you would have 6S * 6Ah = 133.2Wh with a 40C discharge rate. Since lipos are capable of discharging high currents they generally do not need to be wired in parallel, your pack in series should be capable of 60A continuous and 120 in parallel. Li-ion packs need to have cells in parallel since their discharge rates are much lower (eg. 20A continuous for Samsung 25R cells).

C rating is what they use to show the discharge rate of a lipo pack. You multiply your packs amp hours (Ah) by the c rating to get max discharge rate. eg 20C * 3Ah = 60A

## \#156 Posted by: osbor Posted at: 2017-01-29T05:43:46.128Z Reads: 266

speed is based on the number of cells in series
you use parallel to add range on that speed
its not like adding more in parallel drops your speed

so a 6s4p is slow but lasts a while (24 total cells)
a 10s4p (40 total cells) is faster and lasts a while as well

i guess another analogy would be like cylinders. as you add cylinders you get more powah, and parallel is adding more gas tanks

With the bluduino, it would be straight forward (though not easy). VESC has UART, and I'm pretty sure bluduino does as well, so you'd just need to interface with that and then bluetooth to the phone. Probably a little more work than it's worth, especially since there's a few good apps being developed around here that can interface with simple bluetooth chips.

12s4p means 12 cells in series (end to end) and 4 in parallel (next to each other). think 12 x 4 grid = 48 cells. 10s3p just means 10 in series and 3 in parallel. Higher series number means more cells end to end and thus a higher voltage. Higher parallel number means more cells across and longer runtime (for the same series count)

I have a build with a 280kv 5055 Turnigy Aerodrive, a 150A Turnigy Trackstar car ESC and two 5Ah 20c lipos in series. The drive train is a 15/35 9mm belt on 70mm wheels. I didn't know anything about this stuff when I bought the parts and as you can imagine there is room for improvement on the board. I cannot go full throttle up hill as the belt skips. I think my mount is a little too weak and bends under the torque. I cannot start from a complete stop. Its hard to get a smooth ride and the ESC has a boost feature I cannot disable which is scary as f%#k. To sum it up, the build is a little rough around the edges, but once up to speed it runs good (and fast) and it breaks good.

Now to my question. What would be your primary upgrade? VESC? Dual motors to eliminate belt skipping? Lower kv motor for more torque?

Hey,

yesterday I've ordered my first VESC :)! However my current setup is 6s2p with an SK3 50mm 320KV motor. I was wondering if changeing to a lower KV motor (SK3 5055 280KV) would make the setup a bit more VESC friendly or would just be throwing away 50eur for nothing? I know preferably I'd also go with a bigger battery like 8s or 10s but I'd first like to work with what I have. Any insight woud be greatly appreciated thanks!

320kv is okay for the VESC if you stick with 6s forever. If you can get even lower than 280kv it would probably be better, especially if you're going to change your battery in the future. If you're looking at 10s, I'd go all the way to around 180kv

I am in the process of building my own electric longboard. As I live in Norway it is problematic to get alot of the parts.

My question is wether or not this motor: http://tinyurl.com/j8utyp7 would be a reliable option. I am using it together with the Flycolor 150A ESC for RC boats. Will there be any problems here, and what battery setup should I go for?

Getting from Asia isn't necessarily a bad thing, but you have to be really careful about quality. It's definitely a false sense of saving money as you'll get something, it will likely break, and you'll have to replace it costing even more.

With that said, I don't see any obvious issues with that motor, but I would encourage you to try and find a European reseller of a proven motor. I don't know much about the resellers over there, but you can start here: http://eu.electric-skateboard.market/

I would caution you away from that ESC. The VESC is the favorite here because it's extremely robust and can handle what we're doing with them. There's a few car ESCs that have been used without many issues, but I would not recommend any boat ESC.

I think the biggest culprit for the fire was not getting the loop key properly on there first. My friend was messing around with stuff until he got both vescs to light up, and we had already figured out how to get the Watt meter to show, but when he tried sticking them between everything else, the fire happened. His fingers got burned and turned black... But any ways, I believe the loop key will be my most important task.

I'm currently getting the last bits together for my first build. I have the vedder anti spark switch, 2 x 4s 5000 mAh batteries, 230 Kv motor, orangatang wheels and a 4.12 VESC.
 
The VESC I received came with a heat sink already connected in a heat shrink tube which is good however the wires that were already soldered onto it are only 14 AWG.

Do you recommend that I remove the heat shrink tube and change the wires to 10AWG but as a result stand to lose a way of attaching the heat sink?

I was figured that would be the answer but it was worth just checking as it's a pricey component.

My only other question regarding wires is that if you use a higher gauge wire can you increase the length between the batteries and the rest of the components. For example having the batteries at the front of the board and the VESC etc. at the back with the wires reaching between. I'd read somewhere on this forum that it shouldn't exceed a certain length.

To be honest I'm not 100% sure as I am not very well acquitted with the VESC. I asked for those settings because I know that's what you need to see weather the setting are good or not lol. IMHO 2.8V per cell as a cutoff end is a bit low and will cause your batteries to have a little less life but that is up to you. As for the other settings, they look fine to me but I would definitely get some other people's opinions.

Maybe @rpn314 or @Ackmaniac can help though.

Hey all,

I love my Rocket Dual, but really miss having a drop deck and don't love how stiff the Rocket is. I think I want to move all the components over to a new deck and enclosure. 

Where do you guys get enclosures? I know a lot of you make them but I don't have the tools for that. Mine would need to be pretty large: 600mm L x 170mm W x 28mm H internal. 

And I'd want the deck long enough that the motors could sit behind the enclosure, as opposed to above it. I love the style/shape of the Landyachtz Evo but would love opinions about similar drop decks.

Any help is appreciated. Thanks!

Just take a multimeter and and check each cell (one multimeter wire to minus other to 
pluss  of each cell).

 There is no wrong wire, you can even put minus wire from multimeter to cells pluss, and + to -, it will  just show your reading number with minus. In other words do not care too much about polarity of your multimeter it will read anyways!

So check each cell, so one connecting point is on outside of pack other in thr center. Check and see witch cell is damaged.

But maybe just nickel strip is damaged!

Yeah VESC is pretty much industry standard at this point. It's open source and endlessly tweakable, but also runs great out of the box (after doing some basic setup). Sensored motors give you the smoothest start up from a stop where sensorless motors can get confused and judder a bit at first. I've rode both and it's not a huge difference, but sensored motors are nice. That motor + VESC will do real nicely. 

Sorry, I don't have much experience with different pulleys and such. I can tell you that that motor on 12s with 16/36 on 90mm wheels will do 30 mph and the same setup on 16/32 would be more like 26 mph but beyond that I can't really say.

a battery can have huge capacity in trade for low discharge or low capacity therefore high discharge, or a mix of both.
A powerbank needs high capacity and only really low discharge. So you might have 8 cells in parallel to get the 30ah.
In your board you have more cells in series to get the 10s (36V) and only 3 in parallel. 2500mah x 3 = 7500mah.

10S3p with 7,5 ah = 36V x 7,5ah = 270 Wh
Watthours is the right term if you wanna know how much energy is stored in a pack.
Amphours tells you how much hours a battery is able to deliver 1 Amp. So the Volts are missing here to tell you somehing about the energy.

Battery pack question here! If I was looking for an alternative way to solder battery packs together would I be better off using copper braid ([11mm Flat Copper Braid](http://www.ebay.com.au/itm/1m-3-3ft-11mm-Flat-Copper-Braid-Cable-Bare-Copper-Braid-Wire-Ground-Lead-1-5mm-/142147337023?hash=item2118a43b3f:g:E4EAAOSwLF1X~1Ue)) or solid copper wire ([COPPER WIRE, 2.0mm](http://www.ebay.com.au/itm/5-MT-99-9-PURE-SOLID-UNCOATED-COPPER-WIRE-2-0mm-14G-SWG-12G-AWG-/252085684276?hash=item3ab17a4834:g:ZWkAAOSwMtxXu6te)) to hand solder?

Not positive but it might raise your top speed a couple ticks. 

Your top speed will likely be limited by wheel size. I run your same dual setup but on 90mm wheels and it'll do 30mph.

Hi guys, what settings should I change to help make my board less torquey? It jumps from under me too much to feel comfortable with riding it. I had shoulder surgery in December and I kind of need it on the more safe side than super speedy. It has hub motors so I also have to do a little kick start so if I could make a bit more smoother when the motors take over it would help a bunch.

A) Your battery souldn´t be dead, check your cells with a multimeter
B) I´d get rid of the insulation strip and weld them in an other way, so they won´t be so dangerous close to eachother for shorting. 
If you wanna leave it that way and have no possibility of a new battery layout, try to isolate these parts as good as possible and fixate everything with proper tape and/or heatshrink.
Check if all connections are still fine and redo them if you see something damaged.

After using this for a while I plan to get a 18650 setup since you can squeeze out more range. 

I spoke to the folks at hobby king and they were very kind, enough to send me a replacement even so I'll wait for that before completing my build. 

The cells are well balanced, 4.18V each last I checked but I think I'll stick to the 4.1V to 3.2V range to ensure they last longer.

I am looking for a BMS for my setup. I am planning on using 2 5000mah 5s lipos in parallel. I was looking at this bms http://www.ebay.com/itm/18V-21V-18-5V-5S-30A-Lithium-5x-3-6V-3-7V-Li-ion-LiPo-Polymer-Battery-BMS-PCB-/322366720925?hash=item4b0e8dcb9d:g:D8cAAOSwTdJXRWRF

The maximum continuous discharge is 60A which I believe will be enough. Question though, how does one charge through this board? I would like to feed it a decent amount of amps, probably about 10A charging input. This will charge the batteries in an hour. 1C charge rate. The issue is there is no spec on what input charging voltage to put in on their ebay page. It would be great if I could use one of those standard universal style dc power supplies, not the laptop ones with often low amps. I would love to be able to get a ac/dc setup that is discrete to the board itself. The hobby balance chargers are very limited in their wattage and require more connections.

Don't run 5s. Run them in series for 10s. And get a 10s BMS from either bestech or supower

Reasons:
Higher voltage -> better efficiency/less amps -> more range 

5s is slow af and won't pull any hills

And charging at 10A will kill the batteries. Charge them at 2A or 4A

I don't know. I am using my board I made for $200 on 5s right now. I clocked it at 15mph flat ground. Any faster and I wobble, it is not a full length board. You're right about hv being more efficient, but it is also more expensive. As for the charging rate, you can infact charge much faster than 2 or 4 amps with no damage at all. Running 5s 5000mah in parallel is 10ah. Charging at 10A is a 1C charge rate, what all lipos can easily handle. Higher discharge rated cells can charge at 3 or 4C.

You can decide the polarity for yourself. It should however correspondent with the counterpart. Usually the inside/pin is positive and the outside is negative. 

If you already have the male part wired up just plug it in and use your multimeter to check the polarity.

Yup, make sure you are measuring voltage. Plug in the male port into your DC socket. Then measure both the pins and if it shows a negative in front of the value then the polarity is reversed. (Measuring voltage = measuring in parallel -> positive to one pin and the negative to the other pin)

Looks okay, your brakes are kind of weak though, I usually put motor min 10 amps below motor max (in negative), so maybe​ -50A for you. If you're using 18650's they typically have a max charge current of 4A or less. Since you have 4P you should go no higher than -16 battery min

Had a question about BMS wiring. I've actually already built a board but just now getting into BMS charging. This is what I'm trying to do. 8s2p battery with this [BMS](http://www.batterysupports.com/28v-29v-30v-60a-8x-36v-8s-lithium-ion-lipo-battery-bms-pcm-pcb-p-264.html). I'm thinking that this is not possible because then all the cells are not monitored, only pairs of cells. This means that one cell, in the pair, could be very low and the other high and equal a normal voltage. Would this ever happen? Also is all of the wiring corrrect?

With the pulley ratio or any sort of gear ratio like that you are trading off speed for torque or vice versa.  If all you care about is torque and going fast doesn't matter then you just want a ratio between the teeth on the motor and teeth on the wheel to be a smaller fraction or larger number of difference in teeth... 10T on the motor and 30T on the wheel means the motor needs to turn 3 times for every full rotation of the wheel (driving pulley moves 10 teeth per turn, need to move 30 teeth of distance to rotate the driven pulley on the wheel), a 10T : 40T ratio means 1:4 or 4 times the turns on the small pulley to turn the big pulley.  For that last example you get a 4 times reduction in the speed and a 4 times increase in the torque, instead of moving 1 lb 1 inch you can move 4 lbs 1/4inch and not change the motor.  Basic point being if speed isn't a requirement just go with the highest ratio that seems reasonable and you can find parts for and you'll get the most push out of the motor for hill climbing.  Since you mentioned it's for a project if you're doing something remotely controlled you'd want to definitely have more traction than you would have on a regular skateboard, you might also want to consider just using stepper motors instead of RC style high speed motors since the drivers will be cheaper and keeping tight control of the steering with one stepper driving each side will be easier.

Hey guys, I'm an aspiring electric skateboard maker with a quick question about what battery I should choose. If anyone has helpful advice about my questions that would be great!! 

Recently I have been looking at batteries for my board, I have come across a seller who builds and sells his own batteries with extras. It is a 10s4p battery which is fantastic as it achieves my goal of 40kms/hr and a range of 20ks plus, however it is a bit pricey at $455. It is the one I have linked here http://www.chiboards.com/shop/10s4p-samsung-25r-e-board-pack
However I have also come across another battery with a 12s12p configuration that is way cheaper at only $30 but does not include any extras that the other battery does. I have some concerns over whether this battery is to good to be true for the price. This is the battery here https://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/43-2v-lithium-ion-battery-pack_60697516856.html?spm=a2700.7735675.30.10.MFUoqI&s=p

With the second battery I do have to buy the BMS, Charger, LCD battery gauge percent display,  Anti-spark soft on/off switch that comes with the other battery.

Could anyone give me some advice on which battery I should get, that would be much appreciated.

Hi there, i´m about to build my first electric longboard and i was wondering if i could substitute gearing for kv without any drawbacks.

In short and simplified: Would a 100 kv motor with 2:1 gearing yield the same performance (especially uphill) as a 200kv motor with 4:1 gearing?

I´m wondering because sometimes i see same size motors (like the SK3s) with different kv having different power ratings.

In theory they would be the same assuming they have the same power delivered and same efficiency.  My guess is in practice since you have a shaft held in place by bearings being rotated at higher speed means more loss due to friction (also mosfets and mosfet driver chips are switching at a higher speed).  If you see two motors with the same kv but one has a higher max wattage then it can handle more current and/or volts so it has larger wires for the windings in the stator and larger magnets in most cases (barring better design or build quality and components).  Geargenerator.com is a pretty cool page for messing with gear ratios, also a few esk8 calculators out there.

Hi, I am new to the electric long board community and i have just finished my first build but I'm experiencing an issue that I can't figure out and makes my board scary to ride. First off, here is some of my board facts: vesc with firmware 2.18, (2) 5200 mah 4s 35c lipo in series, 245kv turnigy aerodrive motor, single drive, running on BLDC. The problem that I am having is that after riding for 10 minutes or so the vesc seems to completely freeze up (freezing as in if it is braking the braking will continue). It can freeze while braking, accelerating or at a standstill and the only way to stop/recover control of the board is to power off the vesc and power back on. After it freezes once and is restarted, it will freeze again more frequent than the first 10 mins. I thought it may be due to heat as I have a sealed wooden enclosure, but I had it freeze today after sitting still for about 2 minutes after riding and have thought that the vesc is made to slowly reduce speed not lock it when overheating. This results in a scary ride and I've already fallen once due to a runaway board. If anyone has any ideas, I would greatly appreciate feedback as its a blast to ride when it works.

Your absolute max should be 130A and untick Multiple ESCs over Can, if you run single motor.
Also it seems that you havn´t done a proper motor detection - your values are a bit to straight. Do a new motor detection, hit Apply and after that Write configuration, lot´s of people do miss the last past.
Then hit the road again and everything should be fine ;)

You should feel a considerable resistance when you have two of the three phase wires coming out of the motor shorted, otherwise if there is nothing attached and nothing shorted you shouldn't feel much resistance.

Sounds like it should be fine you should notice way more resistance if you intentionally short the motor phase wires (with it disconnected from anything else).  Been a while since my motor has been off my board but with my quad motors that are BLDC too you feel a small resistance and they tend to have a small snapping between positions as you turn them by hand.

An update to the freezing problem I was having before, I changed the recommended settings and I still had some problems. I decided to use a different tx and rx, this time using one that I know works with my rc cars. I am now experiencing rather severe blipping when riding. There are small pauses in the acceleration or braking that can put me a little off balance. I also had the board freeze again, this time at a stand still for maybe 15 seconds before regaining connection again. Also when coasting, the board would accelerate at random times for short intermittent bursts without any input from the throttle. So with all these problems, I still don't feel comfortable riding, hopefully they are all related and hopefully it can be solved. Here's my new vesc settings. <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/1/e/1e8e1f646731a5e6ecd8c50d36fafb82a505ccbc.png" width="690" height="388"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/3/8/3873f92baa6873d9278c0aef29a89cb6e6cbc6f1.png" width="690" height="388"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/5/f/5f33e3df0762266cc235aa98625cb6cfe8786587.png" width="690" height="388"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/a/e/ae6b857521a2778645f2e330a9987a119e7235c3.png" width="690" height="388"> All help is appreciated :relaxed:

When you check the ppm display is it consistent (pulling trigger smoothly and consistently increases percentage, letting go goes to idle pushing it to brake smoothly goes into the braking percentages)?  I found when I would brake and accelerate quickly I'd introduce a lot of extra noise into the receiver connection to the VESC and moving my receiver seemed to help (I also used a better shielded wire for the receiver, connection, think a ferrite bead can help to attenuate high frequency noise on the line as well)

Just by looking at the bar while the board is on the bench it appears to be ok. It looks and sounds ok when it's on the bench, I guess maybe it only happens under load? However it might only be noticeable under load. I haven't pluged it into the computer just after riding while it's having the blipping problems though.
```

Yeah I was able to see all the noise on the line with an oscilloscope but on the PPM display it just seemed to make the values come through a bit jerky and if I slammed it on full brakes and full acceleration quickly enough while bench testing I could force it to lock up.  When it's under load you'll be pulling more amps and therefore making more electrical noise, but could also just be a loose connection between the receiver and VESC, is the connection soldered? if not would suggest putting a dab of hot glue around the JST connector to hold it into the VESC well to eliminate that from possible issues.  Would be good when it cuts out to see if your receiver still has power or if the VESC itself is resetting or just the receiver (or neither and it just lost signal between the controller and receiver).

---

Edit could also just solder the receiver connection to the VESC to be sure that connection is staying solid (probably good to just solder the wires directly to the receiver pins and cover with heatshrink to avoid needing to remove the male header pins)
```

I'll probably have to try the hot glue and test that first when I get some time and then try to solder it after. It'll be a pain in the butt because I've got the vesc tucked in to the enclosure quite well and I don't intend to keep using this same tx. Soldering and desoldering might be a bit tricky
```

## \#362 Posted by: whiteflight Posted at: 2017-07-18T03:42:10.999Z Reads: 129

So I went with what you said, I soldered on a servo extension cable so that way the pins on the vesc are easy to get to. I plugged the other end of the cable straight in to the receiver and it fit snug so I decided to leave that without glue or solder. To my surprise, it fixed everything. I thought for sure it would have been something more complex. I'm thoroughly impressed that you figured that out based off my description. The JST connector must have just been vibrating around/off of the pins on the vesc too much. Also, now the pins are easy to get to for when I get a new tx. Thanks for all your help :grin:

I'm a noob looking for parts for my electric longboard. I'm more interested in range, rather than top speed (>25-30 km/h seems very scary and dangerous to me). Is there a way to increase the range at the expense of top speed? It seems to me that regardless of how you arrange your batteries, the range stays the same. Is it possible/advisable to program the VESC to limit the top speed of the board? 

Also: do I need risers? How much do I need to raise the deck from the ground? Is it advisable to use angled 1.5-1 cm risers? My retailer only has those or 3mm flat risers (which he can give me for very cheap)
```

## \#364 Posted by: TarzanHBK Posted at: 2017-07-18T10:17:16.242Z Reads: 143

Range is nearly only affected by the size of your battery. All you can do is affect torque or speed with your gearing. (to keep it simple - there are more factors involved like a balanced setup itself, but let´s not think about that for now)

Vesc is capable of limiting top speed - ERPM setting.

If you need risers depends on what deck you´ll be using, which wheels, if you want a smoother, dampened ride and so on.
Build the rest of your board and then decide how much you need to rise this thing from the street ;)

Just don't jam it in there super fast and you'll be fine basically first half of plugging in it goes through the resistor part so doesn't get inrush but the capacitors will still fill within half a second or so (would guess less, I have to push it in there quick to hear any spark), I don't ever really think about it but just take it easy and will be fine.  Also make sure it's fully plugged in before accelerating or you'll fry the resistor and when it expands it's really hard to pull out (twss).

When motor specs put the bolt mounting distance, is that measurement the distance between the two bolts diagonally? Or are they talking about the distance between each one in the x and y direction like a square?

On the pictures of SK3 6364's, they look a lot more far apart, but the specs say 32mm which seems to be linear x and y distance apart?

Even a hair dryer would work. You don't need much heat.

You just start heating up one end of the grip tape (front or back of the board), for maybe 20-30 seconds, then use a knife to get under the grip tape and start peeling back, still heating the next area as you go. Sometimes you only need to heat the first bit.

Plenty of videos of this on YouTube, if that's easier to follow/understand. Good luck!

Is it possible to wire up dual vescs in parallel for increased current to a single motor?

IE: dual motor setup w/ chained canbus'ed quad vescs with each motor having a master/slave (master=power+pwm+sensor, slave=just power).

If not, why? +Is this something that could be available via firmware in the future?  It seems like amps are the limiting factor w/ vescs, especially w/ 63mm, but that could be a potential stopgap solution until vescs catch up re: amp ratings... Just imagine >100a cont+FOC.  I haven't seen any evidence this is currently doable, but I don't know enough about VESCs to come up w/ a reason why it couldn't be.

If so, any info/examples on this?  I haven't had any luck and usually my google fu is strong.

edit:
it'd look exactly like this rendering:

I have velcro on my battery mounted to the deck. Could do the same with esc if they are wrapped in heatshrink or similar.

And it sticks alright? I figured going over bumps, eventually either the adhesive or Velcro would unstick and the batteries would fall off the deck. Maybe I could use foam braces on the bottom of the enclosure to ensure the batteries are pushed upward and can't fall.

Hey there!

I am currently in the research phase of building my DIY and still reading a bunch. I do have two questions at the moment which I hope steer me in the right direction.
1) I do not have a spot welder and I heard that soldering the batteries can be bad for them. I noticed that NKON sells cells with solder tags. Would that be a good alternative to spot welding? Are there any cons do using those solder tags?
2) I want to build a board with a long range. So far I know that increasing the number of cells in parallel will increase my capacity and therefore range. Is there anything else I should be looking out for to have long range on the board? (I am not aiming at high speed and live in a pretty flat area).

Any feedback is much appreciated!

Hey 
if I want to get a range of 15 km+, what batteries (lipo) should I get.
Here is what I thought might help you calculate my range

1. 4 90mm flywheels
2. Pulley set
3. sk3 6364 245kv
4. My weight is ca. 54kg
5. I live in Denmark so no crazy hills

So i have my VESC's programmed to run sensored motors, however after getting all of my wires epoxied into the deck and then re hooked up, one motor seems to be cogging and not wanting to spin. When I unplug the sensor wire to that specific motor It works just fine. 

I have 3 questions regarding this:

1) Can I just unplug both sensor wires and leave the VESC's programed how they are, or would I need to re program? (they seem to run fine good)
 
2) Should I unplug both or leave one sensored and one not?
 
3) If I would want to run both sensored what is the easiest way to test the system to find the issue? 

Again, thank you to this thread! much help has been provided to me here and I am very thankful. Also very thankful to @sl33py for helping me out with everything!

I would run one sensored, and one unplugged.  since being controlled by can bus it should sync up and work fine for the one unplugged.  I think if you want to fix the issue - you'll need to dig out the sensor wires, or re-run them.

My bad for not testing them after we soldered the wires, and before we epoxied them in.

Where's your build thread?  Board is looking AWESOME!  Share it and get folks inspired!!!

Question about BMS and amp. 
I want to buy a cheap BMS only for charging 10s battery with Samsung 30Q batteries.
My concern is on which BMS should I go in terms of amp rating?
I use x2 6355 200kv motors and x2 VESCS, they are configured to motor max of 50A (each).
Do I need to use a BMS of 50A and above, or it doesn't really matter?

If you're using the BMS only for charge and not discharge, you can go with whatever Amp rated BMS you like. As long as the charge A rating fits your needs you're fine to go with 2A charge, 5 or 10A discharge because you will be bypassing the discharge anyway.

You need an ESC that has programmable cut-off voltages though, otherwise you may over discharge your cells.

Thanks both of you!

So **if I do** plan on also discharging by the BMS, should I pick one that can handle the amp that is configured in the BLDC tool? Lets say, if I set it to 50A each, I need 100A BMS?

Make sure not to mix Motoramps with Batteryamps - different values!
Just saw you mentioned 50A Motor max. They can be much higher than Batteryamps (you´ll find a few threads here about that).

What batteries are you using?

I thought that the amps that the motor is taking is from the battery itself.

In what configuration?
For example 10s4p with 30q is able to deliver 80A, so you should pick a 80A BMS.
With 10s3p you´ll have about 60A max, so a 60A will do the job.

Yep it´s only related to the battery

However, to extend the range I might order 4 more to put those (2x 12S1P) in parallel to create a 12S2P (is this correct?). If I want to add a BMS, how do I connect the balance plugs? Do they also connect to the bms in parallel (so wire 1 from pack 1 and 2 go both into balance wire port 1 of the bms, etc?).

@Nix 
Mosfets are basically the components that regulate huge amounts of power (10s = 42v and 50Amp for example) using the small signal a chip or microcontroller can provide.
The relationship between motor amps and batt amps , at least in current regulated modes ous related through the duty cycle but I will leave that one for someone who knows more

Hi.  I am using 2 6S LiPo's for my esk8 that are left over from my RC Heli flying days and am testing my first board and learning how to program the VESC's.  I have them wired in parallel at the moment so I have set my Max Input Voltage to (6 * 4.2) 25.2V, so I am running at 6S as my first test.  This is under powered, but I don't want to run at 12S yet and want to try different voltages to find the sweet spot for me.  If I wire my packs in series, I theoretically get 12S and max voltage of (12 * 42) 50.4V.  BUT, can I limit the voltage and test different "packs" simply by setting the Max Input Voltage to a lower value?  ie set it to (10 * 4.2) 42V to simulate a 10S pack?  Is this safe / anything to worry about?  Cheers.

https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01N4BAW6R/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1

they work really well a bit upset I didn't use them earlier... only problem I see with them is need a pretty deep hole to sink them in so you might end up with a hole through your board anyway (can still cover with grip tape).  I'm using them for my electronics box but should work for whatever.  Also should mention I cracked a few of these tightening them into the holes so just something to beware of, don't over tighten and or make your holes big enough.

I have a couple Qs from another thread, but Im hoping for a quicker response here so i can finish some of this work before the 'ol ball and chain gets home lol...

so i have an idea for a swappable eboard/ebike battery 
(although i probably should have a nice bike battery that mounts to the frame, for now itll be behind me in some sort of container)

1)So for the 8p battery I take the 4 male connectors... have 4 wires connect as 1 at the female, pos one side neg the other... does this work ok?

for the bike ill use 4 batteries (8p) ... for the board Ill use 3 (6p)
so wire gauge... Im sure the easy answer is the thicker the better, but I have 16ga on hand, and some 14ga some where.. will the 16 be fine??

2)do all the packs connected have to be the same brand? so if i used 2 ebay packs (lg) and the meepo pack (samsung) any issues?

now perhaps for a stupid newbie question, but i wanted to check voltage on the packs and multi meter isnt giving me 36-42 but a higher number... am i on the wrong setting or something?

 Is it a good idea to run one sensored and one not?
and if yes what is the plug I should get to go into the FOC (or vescx) I can see the TB has JST-ZH 6pin 1.5mm pitch from their website. No idea what a FOC requires for input though. But I can see its not that. Please and thanks.

Its kind of both.  You're psu needs to provide enough watts (VxAmps) to power the rate you are charging (batteryV x charging amps) plus the power losses. If you don't have a big enough psu you can try what you have and if the imax triggers the low voltage alarm, reset and set again to charge at lower amps.
What are the specs of your psu and batteries you want to charge??

nominal voltage is 3.7v per cell, so nominal voltage on a 10s pack would be ~37v.  A full charge is going to sit ~ 42v. (4.2v per cell). That is why you see chargers that go up to 42. (its the bring the battery to 100%) 

Hopefully this picture helps illustrate what I am trying to say.

Hey guys, 
my hub motors are finally arrived, but the hallsensor cables are not going to a connector. Which connector type should i used or btw i have to order? 
I am using the china esc (https://www.banggood.com/Electric-Skateboard-Longboard-Controller-With-Remote-Dual-Motors-ESC-Substitute-p-1202299.html?rmmds=myorder) 
it seems to be, that they are identical with the lipo balance plugs. (Male JST XH 5PIN 152mm) i'am on the right track?

thanks for helping :D

When i stand on it,  the motor turns but makes a lot of noise, like its spinning over some gears inside the motor itself.  I think the motor is to weak.. But thats weird cause most people online suggest this motor, the turnigy sk3. Can someone explain why its doing that or what im doing wrong?

Solar panels don't generate a lot of power. Here's an example:

http://www.goalzero.com/p/179/nomad-20-solar-panel

The panels outputs 20W. If you want to charge a 12S 8Ah battery, it'll take 4V * 12 * 8Ah / 20W = 19.2 hours assuming 100% efficiency and 100% sunlight. 

They're also very fragile.

The Turnigy sk3 motor is not sensored and what are experiencing is called "cogging"

You have to kick to raise your speed above zero, then use the throttle.  This is because it's not using sensors

The parts used in the vesc circuit shouldn't be run that high, especially with a reactive load like motor windings.  I'm not trying to run my controller on the razor edge of what's possible because it increases failure rate.  I'd prefer if the board failing on me was kept to an extreme minimum, especially if it means I lose brakes and definitely if it means a $150+ part is the thing failing

Just type in "solar" in the search bar and you´ll find some people who tried different approaches to this topic.

What makes sense, is a solarpanel charging a car battery at home, where you can connect your board charger to  (12V input, maybe use a step up converter) and charge your board.

I don't want to hear any "person X did it and it's okay"  @TarzanHBK  I even said in my post lots of people do it.

That doesn't change at all the fact that you you are running the components on the edge of failure (into a reactive load, at that) and nearly every single piece of electronics you use in your life has at least a 40% margin of error.  And those are all pieces of electronics that won't throw you jaw-first into the street if they fail or kill your brakes at the top a huge hill.  It's just not worth it.  It's also a very expensive component if it fails.

Even at 10S we're running with a smaller margin than that.  At 12S, the margin is tiny and at 13S there is no margin at all, you're running at - or over - the rated limits of the components.  8S is actually the sweet spot for rock-solid dependability.

So my point still stands.  I don't recommend running 12S with a VESC.  If you don't value your body or your belongings, feel free to do it.  But I still can't recommend it.

Yeah, people do it.  People also [eat swords](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glzMLZ6BaUo).  I don't recommend that, either.

Our Vescs run best at 10s, thats what it´s designed for. At this voltage you have the perfect voltage to current ratio for our application and it´s components.

There is a lot of stuff online for everyone to read into this topic, so everyone is able to select a suiting setup for themselfs.

If you wanna run 13s, that´s fine, but you should know what could happen :slight_smile:

Currently building a board, and need some help with batteries. I have 4 4s 5 Ah lipo packs, and wanted to do an 8s2p setup. Is there a way to charge all of this at once, on the board without having to take everything out? Would I need a bms for that? can a bms do parallel charging like that? Would it be better to have two 8s1p packs instead of one 8s2p?

Also, I am having trouble figuring out how to make an enclosure that is able to open and close easily but is still secure. I also want it to look fairly professional, but unforutnatly im still on a budget. I have a concave board too, so that will make it slightly more difficult. Any suggestions?

Also... *cough* how do you start a thread on this site? For some reason I can't figure that out... Pretty sure that's as much of a noob question as it gets :laughing:

Would it be possible for me to switch the battery with my 36 volt li ion battery (from my meepo board)  ?? Or would this damage my board?

This should be fine if you can successfully remove the old battery pack with the BMS and then reconnect the positive and negative leads respectfully. Although there might be some weird circuits in there that needs to be integrated between the BMS or battery, or the software need to be reprogrammed for the specs of the new battery. I doubt that's the case since they're so cheap.

Step 2.) shotgun that beer(s), useless to hold an empty can.
Step 3.) enjoy your blunt while flying down the street while heavily burping!

this plan sounds pretty solid, i may do some testing soon.

I don't know what you mean by "snake pattern" but you need to connect them this way, that way if any of them short together in the middle it doesn't cause a fire because they're already attached together there anyway

I am using two 3s batteries in series for my electric skateboard and will charge it with this bms. I have soldered two female balanceconnectors to the bms and connected the charger to the bms.

When I checked the voltage on every pin I noticed something wrong. The voltage for the first 3 cells were all around 1.3v and changed from 1.3 to 4.2v. The last 3 cells got a higher voltage then 4.2v  like around 6v. The total is still the 25.2 volts if you combine every charging pin, but the batteries will not get the needed voltage in this way. What is wrong here?

I have tried to search the answer but couldn't find it, do you guys have any suggestions?

I am not sure if electrifying walkers is a good idea since it's kind of hard the keep the pace in sync at slow speeds. These motors are meant for high power (20+mph) electronics, maybe look for a dc motor if it's really necessary.

That depends on how long you want your batteries to last. I usually go down to 3.6v. My hobbycharger let's you choose discharge between 3 and 3.3v. The lower you go the less they will last

@XTLA
Thats what i meant with at least. If your esc can control you are nor pulling more amps than the maximum of your batteries go with a higher bms and it will run nice. I'd you can't limit amps then maybe a bms of the sane rating would protect your batteries from high discharge.  But then you would be getting cut out on high acceleration and that is not good either

For electric skateboards, bearing choice is nowhere near as important as it is for push boards.  You basically have 2 routes to take -- ceramic for resisting corrosion in brine and water, or normal steel.  Paying for high-quality bearings is almost a waste of money -- because you can either put the extra money into the drivetrain, where the ROI will be much, much, much, much higher, or just replace them when they are worn-out.  We don't need slick and smooth bearings to get us rolling further, because we have motors for that, and they are a few orders of magnitude more effective.

Why would you use different amount of spacing in the wheels.  Generally every longboard wheel has the same area inside the wheel that the spacer would take up in between the bearings.  If you get all the same bearing all of your bearings will be interchangable.  Zealous bearings are generally 3 buck cheaper then bones have better lube and better shields.

https://www.motionboardshop.com/collections/bearings/products/zealous-longboard-skateboard-bearings
Zealous are 14.00

https://www.motionboardshop.com/collections/bearings/products/bones-reds-longboard-skateboard-bearings

bones are 17.95.  

So almost 4 bucks more that in your own words can go to the drivetrain.

The word "bulletproof" included in your question means that...
...you don't use CANBUS.

Use 2 radio receivers so both VESCs are only connected via the battery wires and via radio waves.  Basically so it's impossible to have a ground loop.

If you want to use CANBUS, "bulletproof" is definitely not the word I would use.

The same thing applies here, if you used two bluetooth modules it might work, but you'd have to connect to each VESC independently.  I've never tried that though, just an idea.

I don't have any advice for CAN other than make sure you never have a ground loop -- make sure both VESC negative supply lines are soldered together.  But I have not used CANBUS to connect them...

If you really want to help the eskate community --- making skate bearings better isn't what we need, I don't think.  We've had decades for that.  It's under $20 and a couple minutes, tops, to change those to new ones.  And I don't want proprietary ones that don't fit everything or ones with certain-size spacers already on them.  *Changing wheel bearings still leaves you with old crusty, corroded motor bearings.*

What we REALLY need are kits & instructions for specific motors on how to change the bearings.  Like give me a kit for for the TB 6374 motor that has any obscure C-clip tool I need and any consumable part I need and new ceramic bearings so I can change those out.

Are the bearings in motors 608 bears because the company I am working with has the ability to do labyrinth seals and ceramic bearings to true abec rating not the abec ratings that the Chinese companies put on the bearings.

Seems pretty solid. I think you might be able to get it somewhat cheaper if you source parts yourself, but then you might go with 6374 and then it would be the same price perhaps. That is if you are able to find the parts for a cheaper price.

You won´t reach those numbers with an Vesc/Focbox and normal 10s4p battery for example.

Just compare motor sizes to know how powerfull a build can be. This one has 6355 motors, which are more or less about the same power as all other 6355 motors you can get. These are really good sized for dual drive and you´ll be suprised how much power these deliver if you ride your eboard for the first time.

If you really want more, you have to get larger trucks like TB 218 and go dual 6374 motors.

Thats one of these old monsterboard motors. You can simply hook a 10s4p on it as it´s rated for 36V.
For more range just get a battery with a higher P count, like 10s6p for example, depending on how much space you have for them.

Yes, those motors work fine at 10S. However, the 4P is not going to give you  a lot of range. Assuming you're using 30Q cells, and the boards that these motors come on never do, you're going to want at minimum a 6P if you want any range. A 10S8P would actually be ideal for these monsters. 

YEs its only an 800 watt motor but hold onto your ass. They throw out a ton of torque and with twin motors you can easily grab a side and throw grass everywhere. You need a P count that can deal with that. 

If you're building your own pack, get a 100amp BMS for this or bigger.

Total count last i looked was about five of these big Tronix boards in my shop right now, mostly in parts and pieces with only one mostly put together and functioning. We've been over-volting and abusing them for a customer of ours.

And yes you can use a bms only for charging. There are a lot of people who does this, the only thing is that a bms between battery and esc is obviously saver. 

Btw if you need a charge only 10s bms: I have one  and I live in the Netherlands so you can buy mine if you want :slight_smile:

Hey,

I just finished my first esk8 build but I still don’t really know what I’m doing.
When i ride my board, it feels fast and agile for about five minutes before it quickly slows down and loses most of its power. I’m using it to 5s 18.5 volts batteries in a series and once it gets below 35 volts it starts slowing down rapidly and barely functions. My question would be, how can I make it work well for an extended period of time? And what wrong with it?  

Parts I’m using:
Torque Boards 6355 190 KV Motor
Torque VESC
2 Turnigy 5000 maH 30c 5s batteries (in a series)

Hello,

Noob here.  I would have made a separate thread but I haven't been active on the site long enough.  

https://www.boardbumpersshop.com/product-page/evolve-gt-at-58t-drive-gear-upgrade-kit

Has anyone tried the 58T drive gears with Evolve adapters from Boardbumpers for the AT setup?  I have an evolve GTX with the AT wheels.  Will this drive gear strain the motors and reduce my range significantly?  I posted this question on evolve's forum but nobody has responded.  

I also want to do the battery mod with the 30Q samsung batteries in the near future.  Should I wait until I've upgraded the battery before I try this drive gear?

Also. I tend to agree with @b264 in pretty much all of his posts. Yes while some of us run 13s... And 12s etc etc. I only ventured here after building almost 20 boards, and having a really good understanding of how the marvelous pieces of things purchased on the internet can behave with one another. That's coming from a guy who's built electronic his whole life, and worked in the power industry designing data center power control logic for years.

It's best to start off small, in regards to voltage, and upgrade, or build your way up. Not only for the understanding of the electronics,but for the understanding of your body on top these magic carpets. Going to fast to soon can be catastrophic. Even more so when you don't understand what is happening on your board.

If it is your first board, I really suggest anyone stick to 10s or lower and grow your hobby into a fruitful experience all around... The skate. The build. The protective gear. Etc.

hobby
[/quote]

Some of us use these the exact same way you use a car.  Calling this a hobby is counterproductive to all of us.  

That's like calling driving cars a hobby because a few people build muscle cars in their garage.  If it's perceived as a hobby by laymen, it's much easier to ban and regulate because it's perceived as "optional".  For me, it's not optional.  I need this to get groceries, go to work, and to live my life to its fullest.  When you call it a hobby, it helps to alter public perception which hurts me in tiny ways.  Each time it's called a hobby it helps to shift the perception into "this is something we can ban if they piss us off".   Whereas, for example, cars -- you think if it was a hobby it wouldn't be banned?  Car accidents are deadly and if that was a hobby the general public would ban it immediately because it's too dangerous to have these steel death machines flying around all over the place.  So let's do ourselves a favor and just try to avoid using the word hobby.  For some, it may be, but for others, it's definitely not -- and for laymen that don't know the difference, the word "hobby" means "we can outlaw this".

This is all.

If you chose to build instead of ride. The time you spend staring at it and thinking how you will put it together. That's the piece I consider a "hobby" unless of course you plan to monetize your "building hobby".

Yes the riding may not be a hobby, it is a form of transportation. But choosing build non monetary for yourself... Hobby.

So your need for them is not a hobby. 

But what else do you call building "things" (insert whatever your building and invested money in tools for yourself here). I guess you could call it a short term project, but projects come and go, they start and end, and likely you won't revisit it once it is finished.

_Hobby: an activity done regularly in one's leisure time for pleasure._

When you build, what drives you? The pleasing end result? If you weren't pleased, why do it in the first place?

Different strokes for different folks. Completely understand the NEED. But if you NEED something and dont enjoy building(the hobby)...that's what @longhairedboy and @psychotiller @barajabali and the rest of our wonderful commissioned builders do...


PS how many kit cars do you see on the road...someone with a hobby that built thier own car...not many... But those builders still exist. Just like us...who all chose to build instead of buy...

Looks almost good. Uncheck the "limit ermp" and set 60.000 as max erpm and -60.000 as min.
You could set the Battery cutoff end to 34V, that gives the Vesc a bit more room before it shuts down.

Charge your batteries, and ride a round till the vesc slows down and report back how much km you went and at what voltage each cell is.

Lipos have another discharge curve than 18650 (Liion) so they discharge flat for a time at 3,7V mostly and start to fall of at 3,5V. If you set them any more lower, you damage them.

1. Plug it into a 3 or 4s lipo(I always start with low voltage)
2. Upgrade to ackmaniac 2.54 or 3.100 firmware...if you desire
3. Perform a read configuration on the motor side and app side
4. Set up canbus and IDs if your using it
5. Set amperage limits and voltage limits on motor general
6. Perform a motor config in bldc or foc
6.  Write motor configuration
7. Go-to the app tab, setup your control type(ppm, ppm & uart, or nunchuck etc)
8. Go-to your control type tab ie ppm, setup your ppm endpoints and center. And failsafe.
9. Pick your motor control type in your app control type tab (ie on the ppm tab, select current no reverse, or current with reverse etc)
10. Write app configuration.

Plug in a real Battery, test it, go ride. There are detailed instructions for each step scattered around the forum, but this should be a good starting place...

Trying to figure out why your voltages are so different.  Your low battery is already at 3.1v. But they should be very close on voltage.  Something with your battery isn't right.  I bet if you checked individual cells one may be toast.  You can check on your charger if it's hobby type

The problem is 34/2=17.  You had one battery at 15.5 and one 18.5.  with your conservative 35v cutoff your two batteries should have discharged to almost equal voltage.  This means something is for sure wrong with one battery pack or your charger. More likely battery and the charger can't fix the problem only mask it.

well with that big of a voltage difference, your battery is toast and thats the reason why your vesc shuts down.
It has definitely been damaged since you overcharged it.
If you had the same problem before overcharging, you have a broken charger or you got a bad cell.
Get yourself a new charger and new battery.

Unless your riding on top of big AT wheels your likely to scrub a lot and that will eventually put a crap ton of pressure on the VESC's and in turn on the pack.

Hey there guys.

I’ve been wanting to build my own electric longboard. But have no idea where to start or how to start.
I would like to have hub wheels instead of a belt driven motor. I also would like it to have a top speed of about 25mph and have power to get up hills with ease. My budget is about 600USD.

Can anyone lead me into the right direction as to what parts I should get, How to build it etc.

Thanks

Absolutely not, the series connections take all the current. They must be beefy enough to withstand the full discharge current you intend to draw from the pack.

With regard to your build plans, hub motors are kind of crap for hills. They have less torque, less power, and are less efficient than non-hub motors. Also, the nice ones are more expensive too.

For a budget build with hills in mind, they just don't make a ton of sense.

With that budget and range goal, a LiPo pack is a good fit. 10s 5ah should be a good starting place. 

Use a BMS if at all possible.

A 6355 motor would probably be a good combination of power and price, and would be small enough to go dual later.

Steer clear of stock 4.xx vesc hardware (maytech, hobbyking, etc) and get something upgraded like a focbox.

Just cruising and not accelerating or braking?  Maybe 50 watts depending on how fast you're going.  Could be a few hundred.

Starting from a stop and powering up a hill are the watt-hogs.  Especially starting from a stop, or even starting from a slower speed and going to a faster one

If you can wait a few months, check out the Jed Jr board.  It's not actually out yet, and will probably be in the four digits like most of the quality boards.

You can tell pretty fast if a board is quality -- if it has hub motors, it's probably not.  Maybe the enertion Raptor2 might be the single only exception to that, and that's iffy

If it has 4 longboard wheels (as opposed to 2 longboard wheels and 2 motors) it's more likely to be a better board although there are plenty of China knockoffs of those too

if you have the budget i obviously recommend making a high end dual, theyre just soooo much more fun, really spices up the commute. you can build one for about $1250.

Duty cycle. 

Let's setup an example.
10s2p 30q, nominal 36v, with an 40a constant current output

Your batt max is 40a
Your motor max is 80a

You battery can provide 36v * 40A = 1440Watts

Duty cycle in simple terms is a percentage of work, from the main power source. For example 25% duty of 36v = 9v

(36v * 0.25 duty) * 80 motor amps = 720watts

Your battery can only provide 1440 watts
1440W/80a = 18v or 50% duty

36v * 0.5 duty = 18v

So above 50% duty, the motor max amperage will drop, to to your battery max limit

1440W/(36v * 0.51 duty) = 78.43A motor max
1440W/(36v * 0.52 duty) = 76.92A motor max

Etc...

#duty-cycle
#peakwatts
#motorpower
#voltage

My DIY esk8 is in progress.. in the meantime still troubleshooting my Blink S since I commute with it.

If the hub motor overheated, could that permanently ruin the magnets in the hub shell and explain the loss of acceleration/torque/top speed? 

Thought I'd ask before tearing apart the battery looking for dead cells.

Thanks!

So it would be 2160 Watts for my battery divided by 46 max amps of my motors would be 46.95volts so would that be like 95% duty cycle?

They are rated for 58V which is important since the normal 32V automotive fuses won't cut it at 12s.

Really it is your power system can provide more then your motor is rated for.

So you will never hit your peak battery wattage with only 46 motor amps...

Im new to the whole esk8 scene and reading for most of that but I do have a couple of questions. This is my overview of my electronics.
![Schematic|690x375](upload://qFRbPgvj4t3DuEuPrzvsfS4ndtc.jpg)

- Im looking to build a skateboard around 16mph (25km). I live in The Netherlands so it's almost all flat terrain. 
I dont see a reason for that speed to buy a VESC so im looking for a esc like

Hello,

I apologize if this isnt the right place to post this, but I searched the forum and all over youtube looking for an answer but I couldnt find anything. Hopefully someone here can help me, or direct me in a place that will help me out.

After watching Low Guido’s Chop Shop’s youtube video I was inspired to copy him and learn about electronics and try out building a skateboard even though I have zero knowledge.
I bought:

HobbyKing® ™ X-Car Beast Series ESC 1:8 Scale 150A
Turnigy Aerodrive SK3 - 5055-280KV Brushless Outrunner Motor
Turnigy 5000mAh 3S 25C Lipo Pack W/XT-90 (x2)
Hobbyking GT2E AFHDS 2A 2.4ghz 2 Channel Radio System W/ Receiver

I ended up soldering the two lipo batteries together in series, and connected them successfully to the X-Car ESC. When I end up powering up the ESC, I figure that I have synced the remote to the ESC because the motor does a small jolt and it is followed by several beeps. However when I try to throttle the remote, nothing happens. Am i missing something? Any reply would be appreciated thank you.

Im looking to Extend range and keep the same speed on my MotoTec Board, both motors are brushed 800w, belt driven, and the battery is 3, 12v 14ah Lead-Acid Batteries. I weight 190LBS and would average 10 miles with and average speed of 18-20mph on mostly flat ground, but switched between grass and concrete. and im looking to upgrade the battery to a 36v 28ah LifePo4

1. Would that even work with my currect set up without swapping parts?
2. If it did work how far could i expect to go and how fast?

let me know if you need more info, any help is appreciated.

A skateboard controller might be better than a car controller because you don't know how smooth the braking is on the car controller.  If it was jerky it wouldn't affect the car too much but can throw you off a skateboard.  It's important that it has really smooth transitions.

That´s a good kit to start with!
You have to bind the remote to the receiver first, after that you have to calibrate the remote to the ESC.
Both things are explained it detail with the papers which came with remote /ESC.

Good plan to upgrade the battery.
First measure how much space you have available for the new battery.
If the 36v 28ah LiFePo4 works out you have the same speed as before, but twice the range (14ah before - 28ah after)

Hi.  Thank you for this place to ask Noob Questions.....

My question:

I want to have backup motors on hand for my Evolve GTX just in case they die I don't want to wait for them to be shipped.

I bought 3 of these below.  I should have asked beforehand but didn't think of it.  Will these by okay? Are they easily swappable?  I know that they are 140kv when I think the GTX motors are 150kv?  Is that a big deal?  I understand maybe I'll lose some torque but I only really ride on Fast mode anyway (not GT) in NYC and do not think I'm even using the GTX's 150kv's full potential anyway.

Was this the right move?

so 3.6V \* 8S \* 6Ah / 20Wh/mi = 8.5 miles

Yes, but those numbers are very fuzzy.  Notice about I said "2-7 miles per hundred watt\*hours"

That's a giant range.  It depends on whether you're trying to maximise range, how you ride, your weight, terrain, wheels, drivetrain, electronics

Some folks can get 10 miles per hundred watt\*hours (10Wh/mi) and a different person on a different day with a different board might get 2 (50Wh/mi)

You can use adapters for testing (make them or @scepterr sells them)

Once everything works and has been tested you can cut them off and just solder the wires together which is better anyway.  That might void the warranty

Charger:![IMG_5390|666x500](upload://h9MpRYiJREhNcoNMWtIScro95CV.JPG)

How long should it stay plugged in after the green light comes on? 


I left it plugged in overnight a while back and the enclosure directly above the bms was still warm. I figured it's normal, just wanted to make sure it's not something sinister.

Was probably about 4-5 hours to charge, then maybe 7 hours with the green light lit.

Hello everyone I am working on finishing up my second building and going to integrate  two VGA ports to charge from. I have zippy 6s x 2.  My only question is do I just take hot and cold and the balance connectors for each battery and put them both in parallel with the connector? Do I need to add any sort of separation between the two batteries somehow, or anti-spark connector to separate from the Esc?  I have an anti spark on off pcb/button. Thank you all in advance.

I have heard some people wait 30 minutes I'm not quite sure though so you let it charge for 4-5 hours and then let it sit with the green light on for 7 hours?  if you have a smart charger the charger will basically shut off when it turns green and then just trickle charge.

Yes you need an anti spark connector between the esc and the batteries.  If you are trying to increase the mah then you use parallel series.  If you are trying to increase the series you would use a series connector.

Yes, I fell asleep before it finished charging the last time i charged it.
I did notice it was warm another time, about an hour after green light.
It doesent get warm untill it's fully charged (green light)
I never took the enclosure off to directly check the temp of the bms.
It warms the pvc enclosure directly above it to around 92°.. @ ambient temp of 70°.

It gets warm after the charging is completed due to bleeding resistors of the bms. If a cell is fully charged the energy has to go somewhere.
So warm means, your bms is working

I'm somewhere near 22-28wh per mile.  What's your average speeds?  

Might be I just accelerate then slow down then do it some more all the time.  But I'm like 225 combined with board.  Also 6'2" so like a giant wall to block air. 🤔

Average I think is like 19-21mph varies. Mostly because I use alot of developments with stop signs to commute around town and barely ever sidewalks or main roads.

I don't always ride crazy..just depends on my mood. But I'm only 130lbs. So at a constant speed it pulls like 1-3amps per motor under 30mph.. if that.

A question regarding range and effective capacity in our boards..

People usually state Watt hours for their 10s4p packs of samsung 30qs as 432 Wh, and to calculate range they divide this with their average Wh/km (or mile). 

However, the capacity used to calculate total Wh for the battery I believe is given by draining a cell from full charge to zero, usually from 4,2 v to 2,5 v. We rarely allow our cells to go that low, so the total watt hours value is misrepresentative to give an estimate of range, if using the given mAh of the cells to calculate Wh, right?

Wouldn't capacity for a cell discharged to 3,2 volts (or however low you go) give a more accurate estimate, ie a 30q would then have a "real life" effective capacity of about 2.200-2.300 mAh that would make a 10s4p pack have a usuable Wh of ~330 until we don't want to go lower..? 

And sorry if my electrical terminoligy is messed up.. :smile:

Yes, but

The capacity drops-off like a cliff after 3,2V.  You might be giving up an additional ten meters of range once you get below 3V

But don't these discharge graphs show that if you stop at 3,2 v at a constant discharge rate of 10A, you'd still have about 600 mAh left in the cell? That's got to be a significant amount of juice (no?), which would mean that the capacity used is only 80% of its rating.

You are right. But it's easier to just go with nominal voltage.  Considering every ride is different Wh usage is just an average for that run anyways.

in RC you wanted the thing to do standing backflips and go 100kmh so the highest voltage coupled with a large motor and a decent esc.  This principle applied to electric skateboards nearly ended me so I'm here cap in hand asking for help based on a street setup, carbon deck, belt system, very similar to an evolve carbon gt

out runners as opposed to in runners? what are the advantages?

I'm going to go large so best motors for pulling a 100kg man up a hill but still having around a 45kmh top speed. not bothered about too much faster than that just want a smooth acceleration with torque

You're more likely to damage the cells than the ESC, most Esk8 setups using 18650 cells like your drill uses with have them in parallel so no single cell is having to deliver all the amps that are flowing out the battery and into the ESC and motor.  Say the cells in there can do 20A at peak for a few moments without frying out or dropping so much in voltage they die quickly... if you are pulling more like 30-40A (or trying to) then you are going to have major problems with the battery.  If you find the max amperage of the cells and limit the amperage in the VESC tool then there shouldn't be any issues aside from possibly needing to push start or not having enough power to climb hills or push against the wind.

My noob question : 

Let's say I want to use the following : 
2x FOCBOX as ESC, it's rated at 120A Peak Current Limit and 60A Continuous Current.
2x [APS 6384S 170kv 4000W motor](http://alienpowersystem.com/shop/brushless-motors/aps-6384s-sensored-outrunner-brushless-motor-170kv-4000w/) rated at 80A max.

Two hypothetical battery configs (based on Samsung 30Q) : 
config 1 : 12s4p - 60A peak, 12Ah
config 2 : 12s6p - 90A peak, 18Ah

I don't know/understand if there is a problem with this setup.

I thought there would be a problem, because the motor would want more current than the ESC can safely provide (maybe I could limit that with software but would lose in performance..) but someone told me the 60A limit was relative to the battery (like config 2 would be bad in my example..?)

Then I read [that blog post](http://www.rcuniverse.com/forum/rc-electric-off-road-trucks-buggies-truggies-more-147/10727012-motor-esc-battery-explanation.html#post10727269) and it said "you need to look at the current rating (maximum AMPS) and make sure your motor draw will not exceed that"

I've read lot of information but english isn't my first language and "electricity" isn't my favorite domain.

Thanks for reading

thanks man, so its most likely an esc issue then.  what i've done is take an over priced chinese carbon board(you know the one,it has the orange dot in the middle, retails for 1800 bucks aus) and try to improve it. I didnt pay that btw, a guy i know has an online store (sk8booster.com) and he bought one direct from china to test and found it seriously lacking so couldn't in all good conscience sell it on his site. 
Good call Jesse from Sk8Booster!!  It looks so good but mine was really badly set up, over tight belts, wiring was all over the place. Every time i turned a corner the right side esc would come unplugged from the motor and scare the shit out of me.  i bought it to use the deck and trucks as the deck is full carbon and the enclosure is big enough to accommodate a 12s 3p or a 10s 4p and then it turned into something else;   
so far I've dropped the trucks through the deck,  moved the motors from underneath to the rear and re positioned the motor mounts to slacken up the belts.  the thing is 100% better but still some issues with the electronics, namely this jerky control and brake issue,  to be honest I should probably scrap the lot and start again but these things are out there selling for evolve money and people are getting ripped so i thought that while really enjoying myself messing around with it ,i might be able to help anyone who has dropped silly money on a board that really only warrants $500 to achieve a product that works.  I'll put a thread up once its sorted with the full redesign but in the mean time i will be hassling you lovely experts to help me get there.

since you are doing dual you would actually cut the battery max in half so you could do 30a or 35a.  I have been told and read that you can go to 40a each for the 30Q but to be say stay around 30A or 35A.  I think you would be ok with the motors but you could always set the max on the vesc to 60a which is the default.  You will probably need to make your max erpm 60,000

It doesn´t matter what your motors are rated (well mostly).
You can setup everything in your focboxes.
What battery you use will tell you how much power you have over your sytem.
If you wanna use the 12s4p, with a dual setup, setup each Focbox to 30A Battery max.
In your motor max you can use the 60A max as standard and rise or lower the amount as you want, to increase or degrease your motor performance.
If the whole setup is too strong, lower the battery amps on each Focbox.

Ok thanks that helped me understand, I was wondering if in case of dual setup I had to divide by 2 max Amps for the battery.
So in case if want the "full power" from both motors, I would need a 2x80 = 160amps continuous discharge current battery? (so 12s11p with Samsung30Qs??) But that would make more than the 60A max continuous current on each of the ESCs? Am I mixing things? still not 100% clear/understood.

So may be simple for some on here can anyone tell me if I need to change the settings a bit on my dual vesc with split servo connectors. Here are my settings. ![20180513_192904|690x388](upload://lgvy7Hc5Zcd6CYJXMp616Baf90f.jpg)
At first I thought may be my problem was dropping signal on remote but I repositioned the receiver but still nothing what happens is when I get on and go it starts but suddenly it stops and the motors tighten up but on the bench test it runs normally may be my wieght is too much for the amp draw. As I also have a bms that tops at 80amps. Any suggestions?

Ok so change max input voltage to 59 cutoff start to 34 or 35 and cutt off end to 33 or 32.  Change bat max to 50 per vesc and bat regen to -12.  Is your set up running sensored or not.  If not you need to give it a kick start.  Also post your app config and ppm section

Ok I guess its a connection for a switch. Since the temp sensor is a normally closed 60° triggered switch, the white leads should also switch the discharge on/off.

This and half the mosfets are missing on my other bms. I think it is explicitly made to charge only. 

Only remaining question I have is why do these resistors get so unbelievably hot when the charge is full (so during balancing) and what can be done about it? I am a little scared of alu heat sinks because of the possibility of shorting something. Also they get so fkin hot that I think a heat sink isnt going to magically solve the problem of shit getting hot near my battery which is supposed to stay cool.

Noob question of the day:

When connecting a [FOCbox with 4mm "bullet plugs"](https://buildkitboards.com/collections/speed-controllers/products/focbox?variant=8123216167028) to an [SK8-149kv motor with "4.0 banana" plugs](https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-sk8-6374-149kv-sensored-brushless-motor-14p.html), do I need any adapters? Looks like they will fit pretty snug, right?

Hello Briman05,

The FOCboxes I linked appear to have the ability to customize the connectors. I will just have him throw on 4mm ones. 

So If I use the 4mm "bullet" connectors, those will work with 4mm "banana" connectors correct?

Thanks!

add to that... 

* BMS
* balance lead/connectors if they don't come with the BMS
* mosfet board (vedder switch or other type) if the BMS doesn't have one built in to plug your on-off switch into
* wire strippers/cutters

Kapton tape is great for its dielectric properties but if you want to keep wires in place with a vengence (and if you don't need a high dielectric tape in that particular location ) before you slip the whole pack into the shrink tube, i would get a roll of Gorilla tape. I have started using it along the nickel edges to add padding to it before running balance leads down the side when i need to, and small strips to neatly tie down the balance leads, and also to add some toughness/padding to the total package.

Next dumb question for the day!

When connecting two FOCboxes together, should I use a [CAN bus cable](products/torque-esc-can-bus-connector), or a [PPM splitter](https://buildkitboards.com/collections/speed-controllers/products/ppm-splitter)?

Looks like they[ recommend a CAN-BUS](https://enertionboards.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/333757028475-How-to-connect-dual-Focboxes) cable. Does it really matter as long as data is transferred between the two? Would there be signal degredation by using the PWM splitter?

Alright boys, let me know if this is scandalous, because I posted it over at a different spot, a few hours ago. Seems like this is a "nooby" question as well. If I shouldn't "double post" let me know, i'll delete it.

So slightly dumb question:[SK8 6374-149KV](https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-sk8-6374-149kv-sensored-brushless-motor-14p.html) or [6374 190KV](collections/electric-skateboard-starter-collection/products/electric-skateboard-motor-6374-190kv) for a Trampaboard? Looks like the SK8 has more power (W), and is cheaper by like $40 when you include the sensor adapter, and looks a bit more waterproof. I'm tempted to do the 149KV SK8 because of the torque to speed comparison. I don't forsee myself needing to go 35mph (yet!), and added torque is always a plus! Thoughts?

By the looks if it, dual SK8's will fit on Trampaboard Vertigo trucks, is that correct?

I plan on running FOCboxes with a 12s4p battery, 66/14 gearing, anything seem wrong?

Thanks!

These are bleeding resistors and this is how a BMS works in most cases.
Every resitor is for one cell/cellpair and if the first cellpair is full, it starts bleeding the energy off in heat, while other cells are still charging. The more cells are full, the hotter it gets, because the more resistors do their job.
This process runs until every cell is full :slight_smile:

So the more parallel cells you have, the hotter it gets?

It gets hotter the higher your charging current is. Doesn´t matter how much parallel cells you use.
The more you put in, the more it has to pass out in heat.

I’m currently running 50’ Caliber II trucks and would like to better stabilize it for faster speed.  Thinking about buying this wedge kit: [https://www.amazon.com/Angled-Wedge-Rubber-Riser-8mm-14mm/dp/B00JXVG3WG/ref=pd_lpo_sbs_468_t_0?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=2J5MPXFBFKJPTXDN77VW](https://www.amazon.com/Angled-Wedge-Rubber-Riser-8mm-14mm/dp/B00JXVG3WG/ref=pd_lpo_sbs_468_t_0?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=2J5MPXFBFKJPTXDN77VW)

A few questions:
1) I’m assuming I would only wedge the rear, and not the front truck.

2) If so, which direction would I wedge the rear?  Thicker side towards the front of the truck or thicker towards the rear?  Does anyone have a picture of a wedged rear truck that I can take a look at?

Thank you!

Hey there guys, I have a slight problem

In order to fit my battery pack, ESC and Fuse box into my enclosure, I have to slightly rise it off the board. Is there anyway I can rise it but still keep it water proof?

It's a carbon fibre enclosure. 10S3P battery.

"waterproof" means it works fine when it's full of brine.  "water resistant" means it keeps the water from getting inside.  I think you mean the second one, but it's best to be both

I've dropped my TSG Pass twice now onto concrete from about 2 feet or so, once onto the visor, and once on the side with a small chip in the paint to where you can see the hard outer layer. I would think it's still fine after that but a few weeks ago I face planted onto the chin and split my chin open on the rim of it. The helmet itself isn't scratched too bad but is it still good or time to replace? I think after falling with a head inside it might be done even though I hit the chin. Thanks!

**Limiting top speed (of Meepo/esc board)?!?**

Hi all!
I am a total noob with esk8s
I decided to start my learning curve with a Meepo board. Due to the national legislation, the board should not be able to go over 25 kmh. I would like to modify the board to make it street legal and therefore I as an unconventional question:
Is it possible to make the board go slower? Should I limit the voltage that goes to motors or modify some other parts of the board? Or is this even doable with a board that has a ESC?

Thank you for your help! :slight_smile:

So here's a question.

I got some wireless headphones last week, and yesterday I head out to to a bit of skating w/ one earbud in, and I noticed I was having problems w/ both my music cutting out, and my motors cutting out. Just tiny little blips, took me a second to be sure it was happening.

Is this... very typical?

This is the first I've had any problems with my remote cutting out at all, and I've got quite a few miles on this thing.

I figured it was interference.

What I'm less sure of how acceptable it is or not.
Is it a reasonable thing to expect your remote not to interfere with other wireless things you bring with you, or is it more reasonable to just expect people to leave their wireless accessories off.

Edit:
I'll be doing a review on this board, thats why I'm asking.

Hi!
Very new here :) glad to be part of this colective
I recently built my electric longboard, this is unfortunate because i feel I dont need a girlfriend now, as I spend tones of time in it....

As a first question in the forum, I have a problem with the antispark plug wich I could not find the answer in the other posts: **it sparks anyway!** is this normal? 

some info prio to the spark:

- this is a 12S 1VESC -motor longboard , postive cable going to VESC has the antispark female in the middle, and close the circuit a male with a fuse. 
- when i plug it half way ,precharge circuit with the resistor, the VESC blinks (I understand here capacitors are charged and i can go all way in)
- when i go all way in  after some seconds a spark sounds in the XT90 antispark, then VESC turns ON  and works fine --for the moment...
- after that, nothing broke, resistor in place, no magic fumes and stuff like that...

in any case im afraid to plug all the times as the spark actually happens despite the setup!

Best regards!
```

hello new to esk8, i got an evolve gtx 2 weeks ago and want to swap the factory ESC's for torqueboards vesc's and remote\receiver, has anybody done this before? 
the reason is that this board is too dangerous with the recent connection issues and im too tense while riding it after it sent me flying yesterday. no mechanical problems( bearings, belts, motors, mounts etc) but sometimes its jerky with throttle, braking delays and cut offs, having to restart and re-pair the remote. i have dissasembled the board and everything its perfect inside, i think is just the fact that the receiver built into the ESC is not good at all ( they designed their own bluetooth module or something like that ). all help is greatly appreciated since esk8 cuts my commute to work from 1h20m to about 25-30min.*crazy traffic*

First of all: What's your opinion on this carbon fiber? It is very cheap but is it good?

And second: With what glue do I glue it, I have seen some tutorials and they use 'resin'
What is resin? I always have tought it is epoxy but is that right?

What glue do you recommend for me

Oh and how does glas fiber help? Does it add also strength to the board? (I know carbon fiber will add more but glass fiber allows you to still have some flex

Any tips for toeside carves? I can scream around a right hand corner (goofy) almost sitting down but lefts are difficult and I'm barely able to keep my balance on harder turns, much less do a 180 within the width of a street like I can heelside. I have a prosthetic left leg if that makes any difference .

hello, what you think.

I will use between the plug and bms cable 26 AWG for charging 12S li ion,  current and voltage from charger. (50.3V 1.5 A).

And,
for connect between bms and vesc i will use 18 AWG, the voltage is 36V (defined by vesc) and probably the max amp is 50 A.

That's not going to work.  You could use 24AWG for charging at 1.5A but I still recommend 22AWG silicone-insulated.  26AWG is too small.  Also if charging at 1.5A you could put a 2A car fuse on that also

Between BMS and ESC you want to use 12AWG minimum and 10AWG is even better, but for single motor, 12 is probably okay.  14 or smaller is not okay and 18 will melt within seconds

this will be my battery, in grey is nickel tag, orange is copper wire the green is the direction of current. and my question is do i have to thick the diameter for connection between batteries, because the voltage ground up and the currerent too.

That is the best way to run the nickel connections.

Any series connection must be 10AWG or 12AWG because it will carry the full pack current.  Use super-stranded, silicone-insulated wire.

Also remember that after you make it, you will be picking it up and bashing it against a concrete wall wheels-first as hard as you can for 30 minutes.  So make it able to withstand that.  Well, you won't be doing that, but you'll be riding it which has exactly the same effect on the stuff inside

as you can see i keep my finger steady but it keeps accelerating to top speed.

Hello All! I have recently got a little bored of my E-Bike so i have switched into the world of E-Boards. me being a longtime longboarder and having worked with e-bikes im familiar with the concept of batteries and motors and controllers but i am looking for advice for getting a custom build. Ive gone cheap on ebikes in the past and always regret it so for this custom build i am looking for a high end build. im thinking 12s6p for battery, either a e-toxx direct drive or a powerful chain/pulley motor with gearing for both climbing and decent speed. with there being so many options for motors and battery's i figured i would ask the professionals! thanks for your time guys i look forward to the advice..  carvon evo r and the raptor 2 are very tempting but i want off road power aswell with the nice 8inch tires. cheers

It will always reach full speed with no load, if you apply a load or stand on it it might be different.

It's because you are controlling power, and not speed.

Making a battery pack for the first time. Plan on making 10s4p out of Samsung 30Q. My question is I know I have to make (10) packs of 4cells into parallel, then connect into series correct ? Also before spot welding anything together, do I have to fully charge up each cell before spot welding ?
```

## \#1009 Posted by: b264 Posted at: 2018-06-01T05:41:25.582Z Reads: 121

All the cells need to be at EXACTLY the same voltage when you make the parallel packs.  It's a lot better if they are all at the same voltage. They can't be off a tenth of a volt and that's just okay, they need to be the same.

Whether they are 3.57V or 4.12V is not as important, as long as they are all the same.  Also, 30Q cells need to be kept between 3V and 4.22V at all times.

Typically the easiest way to make them all the same is to charge them all on the same charger if you have a 1S charger.  Otherwise you will need to do it manually by bringing the higher cells down - to match the lowest cell - with an automotive incandescent light bulb.

If you use a resistor to bottom-balance the cells you need to select the proper resistance to get it done in less than an eternity.  So for example

Assuming you want to use a 0.25 watt through-hole resistor

and assuming the biggest difference in your cells are off by 0.31V (like 3.90V and 3.59V for example)

then using the R = VV/P gives you R = (0.31V) * (0.31V) / (0.25W) = 0.3844Ω

So then get some through-hole resistors at least 0.385Ω like [these 1Ω ones](https://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/stackpole-electronics-inc/CF14JT1R00/CF14JT1R00CT-ND/1830305)

It will, but don´t run lipos until it triggers the low voltage on the bms with 3,0V!
Make sure your lipos don´t run below 3,5V per cell. Shouldn´t be a problem if you set your vesc cutout at something like 3,6V and fully charge them to balance them often.

Absolutely Not!
Because the battery doesn’t determine system current. The Focbox controls battery and motor current separately. 
The higher the battery’s discharge rating, the better. 
Because higher discharge rating = less voltage sag and less heat and stress on the battery. 
And less voltage sag = more power and range.

Not familiar with them but the esc looks familiar from some eBay posts other forum members have posted.  From what I saw they were okay but most people here go with some variation/version of the vesc for the wide configuration and relatively good software for doing said configuration to drive with various batteries and motors and ride styles (controlling acceleration and braking characteristics)

Couldn't really say anything one way or another about the motors or batteries if you know what cells they use can pull up the datasheet or search here to see if others have used them successfully.

Same lipo 5S 5Ah is $46 at hobby king also not clear what BMS or what particular cells they use so not sure I'd trust that without getting more details.

Most likely, yes, you would need an antispark switch to turn the board on and off.
You could use a loop key, which is cheaper, or use an led antspark switch, which looks a bit better, but it's the more expensive option.

If you Opt for a loop key, its reccomended to splice the negative wire of the board, and not the positive wire.

With normal day to day use, pulling 80 amps from two 6374 motors would be crazy powerful... Usually, when accelerating, they would only pull a max of 40 amps from each motor, equating to 80 amps total for like five seconds, but correct me if I'm wrong because I only ride a single drive. :sweat_smile:
Your average amps when riding normally would be much much lower than 80 amps though.
In summary, I'm pretty sure your 10s4p battery is fine for your two motors.

Hi, about to realize my first 12S4P Samsung 30Q battery.
Got some nickel welding strip - 7mm*0.30mm from NKON.
My question is: 
how many strips do I have to spot weld on the 4 cells in parallel  in order to properly manage the current?
How many between the 12S packs?
The idea is to use Bestech 12s HCX-D596 LI12S80A-02.

Ugh.... I've been reading builds and threads for days and I'm still not %100 sure about what motor/battery combo is gonna fit my needs best.

My board current eboard is pretty much my daily driver. About 6 miles a day.  20mph top speed only last about the first mile..... (ride riptide, it's fun but meh....)
Im trying to build a reliable commuter board.
Live in a flat town, weigh around 200lb with my work bag.
Im stuck between duel 6355 and 6374.
Im leaning towards the 74 s not because of their advantage on acceleration but it's my understanding that they run a bit cooler. And since I'm towards the heavier side of some riders and I'm using this as my main form of transportation I'd rather not push the board to its limits all the time.
That being said I've seen a lot of people say that the 74 s really open up on 12s batteries.
And as much as I want the performance from a 12s because I'm used to downhill longboarding at pretty high speeds. I've also seen a lot of users Express difficulties with 12's and 10s just being more reliable and less problematic.....
I'd love to stay over 20mph even after battery lag.
I don't need a crazy battery range... maybe 15miles ish. 
Not sure what my question is lol. I'm on day 24 with no days off work and got off at 5am today.

Hey man, mboards have a fantastic customer service,I have purchased small items from them and shipping(to aus) is cheap and well tracked, the components are good quality and no issues so far.  The items on the website do bare a striking resemblance to the diyeboards stuff and they have mixed reviews.  
The owner has a youtube channel and I found the videos to be well made and very informative to new builders.  links are all on the website.  Diyeboards are the cheapest diy site by far though but you get what you pay for in life!!  Torque boards (DIY electric) are tried tested and reliable which is why there are so many builds with their components but expect to pay a bit more. 

My first build was a torqueboards/mboard collaboration and it is a beast, so much better than anything prebuilt. 
Good luck and look forward to fun times

The items I purchased were small electronics and generic to most of the sites I've used so all I'm commenting on is customer service.

I have 2 problems I haven't been able to find working solutions to. First, I'm having trouble figuring out a way to do regenerative braking correctly. It feels like they are either on or off no matter how I seem to set up the settings, throwing me off the board whenever I try to use it. Second, I get a unknown hall error: 255 when I try to detect settings for my motor in the BLDC tool. I have the motor's set to the values they get before that error is thrown and they seem to work but it wouldn't let me do a full detection. This error only appeared after updating the firmware from 2.24 to 3.48 (I think those are the version numbers, not totally sure though). If anyone knows how to deal with either of these problems please let me know, especially the braking on though. That's scary to ride with.

I am using 2 Torqueboards ESC's along with 2 of their motors.

Do I need to get special trucks for those?

Hi, does anyone know if you can get a case or a silicone sleeve for the Maytech MTSKR1712 remote? It looks like the previous model had some sort of sleeve but mine doesn't... I'm just worried that I'm gonna break it WHEN I fall over!

No please use proper fishpaper, fishpaper is not simple cellulose paper. It's made from a material similar to fiberglas making it non flamable, non conductive and fairly resistant to abrasion. Which is critical in the application we use it as an isulator.

Maybe this is a dumb question. I'd imagine it only work on particular decks. But would it be possible to CNC a custom enclosure for focbox that mounts as a riser pad?
I would imagine it would need to be two parts. one that bolts to the board.  One that bolts to the truck. I imagine it on a drop-down board. Leaving the Box just barely wider than the width of the deck around where the truck mounts to the board to allow room for hardware access to bolt the two sides of the box back together. 
If that makes sense.

I too wanted a board that I could kick push when needed.  Hub will allow that. The only downside I saw was you lose a considerable amount of urethane on your wheels and the roads are too rough where I live for that.
Or find a carvon setup

Total noob here trying to fix a v1 boosted board dual+. I know it might not be the most popular board but any help would be really appreciated!

Symptoms: Controller pairs with board but the motor seems to be totally non responding to acceleration/brake wheel. i Tried it with another controller and the issue is still occurring.

Also by looking at the circuit board, everything seems to be connected but the sensor cable have been sealed with some type of glue so its hard to see whats going on under there.

I have included a link to a video of the led blinking patterns as i figured it might help

I’d try

motor max: 100
motor min: -60
battery max: 60
battery min: -15

If take off feels good I’d check brakes and manage them accordingly. Mind you I like strong take offs like raptor 2 style. If that’s not your thing try 60 motor max first. 

This post from ackmaniac is always helpful. More of us have this one saved.

I use 10mm X 0.15mm nickel strip. If there are two lines, that means im putting 2 nickel strips instead of 1. (not my picture from the side view)

Big amps kill anti-spark switches...so be easy.

If you have ever worked with epoxy it gives a little but not much it is what the use on carbon fiber decks. Depending on the type of plastic and how many layers you use with determine how much flex there is.You would have to fine a epoxy that works with both plastic and glass. Any type of glue works best with a porous material maybe besides JB weld that stuff stick to everything

Okay thanks! I've also seen a lot of people make it the same way, so that should be able to do the job.
If my calculation is right, then will there be able to go 4*13,42A=53,68A (nickel strip is hot) through each series connection. Lets say I set the maximum battery amps to 30A. Will the VESC then ask the battery for 30A and take 3A from each parralel group to make the total 30A? Cause then i technically only need 1 nickel strip on each series connection?

Good luck finding a hub motor for a 6 inch wheel.  The gearing you use has a direct influence on the speed you can do same with size of the wheel.  with a 6 inch wheel and 16-42 gearing you could on 12s li-ion you could use a 140 kv motor to get 56 km/h weighted

hi, I am trying to decide if it is worth it to upgrade to 12s4p over 12s3p. I understand that this would change the max continuous current to 60a vs 45a. would this give the board noticeably more torque and a higher top end speed?

I don't think it will give you more torque or higher top speed. But it will give you more range and maybe even less voltage sag. I don't know about the last one. I would choose 12S4P since I hate running out of juice :slight_smile: good luck!

Dumbest question by far!

On my DIY Trampaboard, I have a 12s4p battery with a BMS controlled by a simple toggle on/off switch. The only problem is that the battery wont turn off - its not responding to the on/off switch suddenly. It used to work, but now it does not. 

Is it possible that if the polarity of the charger input was swapped, that might result in this?

Any ideas? Please respond ASAP, since my board is slowly dying!
Thanks

If it's a 30q pack you can do 60a now.  The benefit of more amps is less sag which equals less high amp drain which adds a lot more range, more than 25%.

They may be for you. There's so many factors... Ride style, acceleration speed, breaking speed, average travel speed, carve radius, rider weight, etc. All if that comes I to play on esk8s when figureing out a bushing setup.

In theory more amps available means more torque assuming your motor and everything in the circuit up to the coils in the motor can handle the amps available but correct on it not having an affect on top end speed.  Range part was correct.

The switch has failed in a closed circuit so it is now always on.  You can either use an antispark bullet or xt-90 to make a failproof switch for the battery discharge (can be on positive or negative lead just opens the circuit to stop current from flowing)

Search the forum for XT-90 loop key or search for deckoz antispark bullet to see some options.  For now would just cut one of the two main leads and tape off the wires.

My preference is 39-40 for comfort and speed, 32 ish for manuverability. I usually do hard (96a) bushing boardside and experiment roadside. It's typically not too hard to find a good fit. 

Both me and @Battosaii ended up using tall barrels roadside rear on our evos, which is odd,  but it's an odd deck. 

Don't be scared to try weird shit 😀. Everytime I see @Alphamail mention double cones I'm like "are you just trying to kill  yourself" but after I tried it... Tons of fun, great carves and awesome return with cones in the rear. Not so great at 35mph, but a perfect setup is almost impossible.

Make sure you break in the new batteries first. Charge to 4.2, rest, discharge to 3.6, rest rinse and repeat four or five times. Those graphene packs have very low ESR values, and should work fine together. How many charge cycles do you have on the used ones? If it's less than 20 you should be totally fine. Does your charger test internal resistance?

Ok so charge one of the 6s units at a time. 

Also I have a dumb question but I can't find an answer on here haha, what is the point of putting the battery charger in the enclosure, can't you just connect the batteries to the vesc directly?

I assume it has to do with just convenience, ie you don't have to take off the enclosure when you need to charge, and all your stuff would have to be modular, ie no soldering? But say all your battery stuff is like plug and play, and your enclosure isnt too difficult to remove, wouldn't it be easier to just take them out and charge when need be. I feel like I'm missing something obvious though

Its mainly convenience.  Most guys use Li-Ion and have the charging port sticking on the outer wall of the enclosure that way they can just put the charger into the port and its ready to charge.  if you dont have a BMS the only way to balance charge the lipo batteries is to throw them on the balance charger.

Oh nice I like that calculator way better than some of the other ones I found. 
I'm not a hundred percent sure on what battery I want to use but that does give me a good idea of what I'm looking at so thank @Michaelinvegas
So would it be safe to assume that the pully setups with a lower top speed would have better acceleration?

So I’m working on my 1st build... 12s4p 30q dual tb 6374 using focbox... I’m trying to get the setting right in the BLDC TOOL running foc senosored motors but can’t figure out why when I hit full throttle the motors won’t spin properly only when I gradually press the throttle & even then it's skipping/stutter when I give it throttle when I try to detect Hall sensor that portion of the set up fails... any help would be greatly appreciated...thanx

update the firmware with the vesc tool that was done by @Ackmaniac and you should get it to detect.  You tried to throttle the motors before you did a motor detection?

Yes I did throttle them before I did a detection but just to ensure they were working & that they were spinning in the right direction while connecting the phase wires....

Yeah you should never try to throttle the motors before doing the detection it can damage the vesc.  Try flashing it with new firmware from the vesc tool and set each focbox separateand do it in the steps it tells you

Noob here.
I couldn't find the answer to this unique question, so I thought I would ask here and maybe get pointed in the right direction.
 I'd like a board that isn't so big, but has big or biggish tires to get over bumps. I'll be using this at work, it doesn't need to have a ton of battery time. AND I'm not even sure it will suit my purposes. 
 Does it make sense to try to put together the parts,(or add a boost to my existing board) or does it make more sense to get something like a new Teemo for around $300 and see if that works?
 I'm just not sure and there are lots and lots of choices and variables. A lot of the time experienced people have already discovered things.
 Thanks!

in the vesc tool it is along the side right side of the program screen if you scroll over it it will say write.  You also have to select ppm,uart, ppm and uart, there are a few others but select ppm and and do the throttle mapping andthen write config.  There should be a wizard on there that steps you through everything.

I should probably try some questions that are not as vague. I might not yet even know what I should be asking.
 I don't mind at all building one, I have a history of that kind of electro mechanical assembly. Not a problem.
 If I assemble on my own is it likely I can get the correct board put together for less money than one that is already mass produced?

If I am not going to be using the board for long trips does the quality even matter?

If I am likely to get into problems like poor battery life or a lack of climbing hills, that's not a problem. If it could result in the board throwing me, that's not acceptable. which would I be looking at?

It's possible after I give it a try, it will not be useful for my needs, I'd really prefer to not sink a bunch of money into it only to find it is all a loss for me. And I expect that resale value would be terrible if it is custom build for my own needs. Is there another way to get to the goal I have not yet considered?
Thanks.

Hey guys, just want to make sure I don't blow anything up when charging my batteries. Can someone please confirm this setup is correct? I have 2 3s zippy flightmax 5000maH, I read it is safe to charge up to 1C so 5A on this. 

Here is my setup: ![20180711_205532|374x499](upload://sl9tBI7PkxleJd1V2O2IoKu0LCF.jpg)![20180711_205738|375x500](upload://9o9OMzG60dTRvOROefmgkYUMhQf.jpg)![20180711_205542|374x499](upload://wWUZHUaAXFi8uHnVY1qw38VplGL.jpg)

The part I'm most concerned about is the balance ports, so from another post here I gathered the loop created between the + on the left battery the and - on the right battery only needs 1 balance wire since it is the same loop. One of the balance ports has only 3 ports so i assume this is why.

Already had some sparks fly lol but that was me being a dumbass and trying to pry open one of the adaptors with a metal thing, I think i shorted the batteries but they seem okay... all the cells were still at 3.77

If your not sure you want to build or not I would get a mass produced one you could get the riptide board or the meepo. The idea of building your own board would be cheaper is sometimes a fail idea because a lot of times you will be buying better quality vesc or motors. Generally the mass produced boards work well but over time they will break down because they end up
cutting corners some where. If you have a deck and caliber trucks already that will save you money

Is it possible to use a **dual hub esc** from ownboard(or meepo/wowgo) to hook up to **one belt driven motor** like a single 6355/6374?

Not only are people saying how smooth the ownboard esc/remote is, I just really like that there's a power button there. I think loop keys are primitive, I hear DIY anti-spark switches to vescs are unreliable, and I'm using a charge-only battery/bms, limiting my options which is ridiculous that it's because I want a simple working on/off button. I'll probably will just end up doing a vesc/loop key, or maybe even fsesc 6.6 after a little more time passes to see it's reliability. 

Also not considering buying a complete board/kit from them, I'm set on having a custom set-up unique to me and how I ride. 

Anyways, back to the question, can I hook up a single 6374 to ownboards dual hub esc? How hard would it be to reprogram what is needed, like gear ratios I presume? Thanks for the help!

Hey man, it seems to me that if you are unsure of what type of board will suit your needs then buy a cheap pre-built as your first excursion into the hobby.  There are a lot of cheap reliable options out there that will get you started.  I'm pretty sure that most if not all of the community started this way and assessed what they wanted a board to achieve before launching a full diy build.  I for one have a meepo v1 that I still use regularly and since that purchase have built 3 diy boards for different applications.  Be prepared to spend though because if it gets you it really gets you!
Good luck!

@banksta
You can't re purpose those  esc's from any of those boards.  They are factory set up for the application they are intended for.  There is no way to adjust settings at all.  Also the hub motor esc's are not compatible with belt drive systems.  DIYeboards sell a belt drive version of the same esc but I don't recommend using their mechanical belt drive system as its cheap and with belts you really need a strong reliable set up such as @torqueboards provides.   Don't be dragged into the false economy of diy you will regret it.  You can also purchase a power switch system which includes an anti spark from a number of vendors.

I'm into DIY because I love building things that are unique to me aside from the novelty of it, and I'm more than willing to spend the costs on quality parts even if it means waiting, as everyone else should. 

Forgive my ignorance but it seems ridiculous that I had to ask this purely because of the built-in power switch that the chinese esc has, while the vesc and focbox does not, all this because of a lack of a damn power switch... Looking at the anti-spark switch + button by flipsky is seemingly the best option, soldering looks quite minimal, something I can do without much difficulty. I'll keep researching and see what works best as my build goes on, more than likely will just use a loop key, its ugly and primitive but the cheapest and most reliable and simplest by far, I don't know, maybe I'll get a quality BMS and wire a switch to it, we'll see as it goes on, that's one of the beauties of DIY. Thanks for answering!

What happens if I use copper wire to wind a 140kv motor  that is double the thickness of the original winding wire? 
Will that result in lower kv and higher torque? Thank you  :)

Noob question: 

So I want to re-grip my evo with some laser cut shapes. I wanted to spray paint the surface wood that will show between the shapes black. It is my first time messing with grip tape. 

If I use spray paint on the surface, will the grip tape have a hard time sticking?

Nope, it'll stick fine.  A couple of tips...  

rough up the surface on the deck so the paint sticks
let the paint cure for a couple of days so it doesn't peel
use a heat gun to remove the existing tape, the heat will cause the glue to release

I would put a coat of polyurethane or spar urethane over the spray paint so if you ever have to peel it off it won’t pull of the spray paint. I would use the rustoleum 2x spray paint as well as it can cover pretty much everything in one coats maybe two.

Hi All,

I’m looking to squeeze a bit more speed out of my current setup.

I have a mixture of cheapish parts from China that I’m reasonably happy with but I max out at 27 kmh (according to strava). I am currently running 6s lipos connected to one of these speed controllers:
https://www.ebay.com/itm/single-motor-electric-longboard-skateboard-controller-ESC-Substitute/302546263597 3 and my motor is a “Brushless Outrunner Motor N5065 270KV 1665W”.

I asked the question earlier if I should upgrade from 6s to 10s lipos but apparently my ESC has a 6000RPM limit?

So my next question is, will upgrading my batteries from 6s lipo to 10s lipo and upgrading my motor to a 190KV motor give me any more top end speed while staying under the 6000RPM limit?

(I will also be upgrading my wheels and motor pulley but I’m most interested in the battery/motor question.)

Thanks
```

Thanks @briman05 .  I realise the ESC is not great and my plan is to upgrade the ESC eventually but I assume my logic is correct that the 190KV motor with 10S will squeeze more speed out of the current setup while staying under the 6000RPM limit?

And does anyone have any recommendations for a lower end (read price) ESC that is better than my current ESC (https://www.ebay.com/itm/single-motor-electric-longboard-skateboard-controller-ESC-Substitute/302546263597)?

If the esk8 calculator says that setup will be under the 6000 erpm limit you should be fine.

Remember, you'll need to remove some solder from your esc to change it from 6s to 10s. Details are in the eBay postings.

So I'm a newbie to skateboards and esk8s. I know chinese stuff is chinese and you get what you pay for generally speaking... But I can't find anything in my price range, which isn't a whole lot tbh so I'm not surprised. I have found what I think to could be an extreme budget build. I'm not looking for speed, I'm not much of a speed demon just need something for a decent ride of about 15km in distance. Any feedback will be helpful. Below are the links to the build I am considering buying just not sure on what will work. I am about 65-70kgs and there are some hills in my area but I can avoid them

I can't post more than 2 links here so I've made a googledoc with the links to the parts

I really like this deck ([link here](https://www.skateshred.com/wholesale-blank-longboard-decks/canadian-maple-wood-drop-through-blank-deck.html)) but it's got a drop through cut for a bottom mount truck.

Is it possible to top mount the trucks **with** a rubber angled riser in-between?  I'm currently using a rubber angled riser on my board to give me some shock absorption and to help with speed wobbles.

I'd like to continue using it but am concerned that the drop through cut out will not provide enough stability.  Thanks for your help!

I have heard though that it's a bad idea to leave the charger plugged into the board when not in the wall. Will this solve my problem or will I still need to disconnect the charger from my board when it's full?

Building my first battery above 4P and it looks like my choices for BMS that can handle discharge of at least 100 A are limited. The supower ones here 200 mm wide which will take an enormous amount of room.
Question is : 
Is it safe to stack these high amp BMS on top of a row of cells? It looks like all the supower bms over 80 amp have a metal heatsink plate so it seems like putting that kind of heat directly on the cells wouldn’t be good.

Hey Guys,

I'm working on the battery today, and have a couple of questions about the wiring. The charging socket and on-off switch mainly. I vahe a 103p battery with BMS, and only need to solder on those switches. I have bought [this on/off switch](https://eskating.eu/product/big-on-off-bms-switch/) and [this charge socket](https://eskating.eu/product/dc-in-battery-2-1mm-socket-with-dust-cover/) but they come without any diagrams whatsoever. Anyone know where I can find these?

```
The on/off switch appears to just be a regular rocker/toggle switch and should just have two pins on it when in the I position the two pins are closed/connected when in the O position the circuit is open/disconnected.  The BMS will need to have a place for using the switch if this will work so you'll need to look into the BMS documentation or with the vendor for how to add the power switch (since it's limited at 6A you wouldn't want to just connect it along the discharge path or it would likely cook while you're riding).  The barrel connectors are either positive center or negative center, easiest way to figure this out is just connect it to the power supply you'll use then check the voltage with a voltmeter off the pads/pins on the back of the barrel connector, if you probe it measuring voltage and it is a negative value then you have the black (negative) probe on the positive terminal (basically they are reversed if it's negative), if the value is positive then you have the black probe on the common/gnd and the red on the positive.

Good to use a voltmeter/multimeter in volt measuring mode and continuity checking mode to see what is connected to what or what polarity etc.

Thanks for your replies!

I bought a batterypack complete with BMS with on/off switch and wiring and charger. The only thing missing were the connectors on it. I soldered the XT90 connector on already, but couldn't find much info on the other two buttons. The wires are also nicely labeled (switch and charge).

So for the on/off switch it shouldn't matter wich pin I connect to positive and negative, as it will just complete the circuit when on, right?

For the charging port. The label on the charger shows that it is positive center, I just need to know wich of the three pins to connect to wich wire, as there are three pins on it (see the attached picture). I don't have a multimeter on hand unfortunately :frowning:

Eh just grab a multimeter it's going to make your life a lot easier (and maybe longer :) ) . Guessing with polarity direction or what exactly is going on isn't a great idea here and good to be able to at least measure the voltage on batteries and things, ideally with a few different measuring devices for confirmation (but at least one).

If you've got a 12V automotive light and a 9V battery or similar around you can rig up a simple continuity tester but really a multimeter is something like $10-20 and will do a lot more for you, would just get your hands on one before hooking things up.

I agree with @wafflejock. A decent brand name multimeter is about 30 bucks on amazon.  I have seen it before where the polarity is flipped so to make sure they aren’t reversed. If I had to guess center is hot, right side pin in neutral and left is ground.

The wheels will give you more of a real effect in a straight line as it will effect your speed.  Surfs are precision trucks so any precision truck will be better then cast trucks.  How ever you can improve cast trucks to make them "almost" like precision trucks by changing bushings washers and pivot cup.

You need to post pictures of the settings your screen caps are to small and can not be clicked to be made bigger but a a general statement you should use 2 motors for going up hills your motor kv is high for wanting to do hills.  Basically higher the kv the higher the speed but less torque.  A way to get around that would be to get a large wheel gear like a 42-44.  So there are a few things that could cause the issues you are having plus you are not using the standard 18650 batteries

So I did 3 big changes to my old set up and my efficiency has gone up tremendously, thing is I was not expecting this and I'm not sure what is giving me this amount of an increase. 

- I put a new deck this shouldn't change anything but the feel of the ride. 

- I'm running FOC instead of BLDC

- new motor mounts with idler pullies. (I suspect this has made the biggest difference because my board free rolls so much better now.

motor mounts with idlers help keep the belt from slipping on the pulley.  Foc definitly could be a factor as it smooths everything out

The Anti Spark Connector XT90S is necessary? 
i can't make a permanent contact, like soldering?
And if is necessary, when i need disconect, for exemple (charging, turn off...)

Thank you :slight_smile:

Looser belts with idlers will help with that but i suspect its foc and that is interesting.  I've never felt the need to go foc but if it is making your board that much more efficient then its worth looking at.
What is your set up?  Haven't you got some crazy fire breathing monster?

I'm building a fire breathing monster but for now I'm riding my Dual 6374 12s4p. The idlers may be the biggest factor cause the difference in free roll from my old belt set up is on another level it now rolls like a hub motor.

I'll check in with you when I'm doing my set up then.  I don't think people are aware of how important belt tension is too.  The biggest noob mistake in RC is over tight gear mesh which can fry your esc and I'm assuming over tight belts will cause similar issues to a lesser degree but definitely something to think about with geared drives.
Funny you are building a 12s 4wd because so am I if I can decide on which hubs to go for. What I'd like is some enertion hubs but they won't sell me any lol.  Plan is to use 2 unitys and tb directs with maybe the battery set up from the zill drive. Something modular anyway.  Patience is a virtue they say.

Maybe dumb question, maybe not.

How many extra cells do you buy when making a battery (assuming you're not a "regular" battery maker ordering them in bulk)?  Like if I'm going for 10s3p that's 30 cells, should I get just 30 or more like 35-40 in case some are bad out of the box?  Or does that also depend on the reputation of the vendor?

Hiya all, just in a bit of a pickle and wondering if I could get some help.
So I have a board with a single turnigy motor with a diy electric vesc and 2 x 3s 8000mah lipos in series (22.2V). Using an XT90 circuit break for a switch.
To give a breif history, with this setup earlier this year the vesc fried and I had to buy a new one and redo the wires as they had melted (the vesc was only a month old and they wouldn’t give me a refund 😒). It was a simple setup and there wasn’t any way I could’ve messed up.
Right now my problem is that the board will run for about 30 seconds then the light on the vesc will flicker, go off and the board will stop. So it looks like the vesc stops getting enough power. Leading up to the moment it completely stops working it’ll turn off and on, making for a jolty ride. Generally the breaks will keep working for a little longer after it stops which is nice. 
Any ideas?
```

Hi everyone. Soon i'll be building a battery pack and im going to make the series connections with 10 AWG. My question is if i have to put some fish paper or heat resistant (kapton tape) between the nickel strip and 10 awg wire. Do I have to worry about the insulation melting and shorting the pack and everything goes on fire?

I understand that following the word of the law, boosted boards are illegal in CA (https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/lets-break-down-the-california-electric-skateboard-law-ab-604/12714)

That said, you see them everywhere so clearly they are not illegal enough for law enforcement to take action.

However, I feel like if they saw a decked out Trampa MTB rolling down the street they might take the word of the law more seriously and ticket you.

That is a very hard to answer question because it is more on the police officer writing a ticket.  Plenty of times if you are stopped and say "aw man I didn't know I had seen other on them so I figured it was ok" they will probably let you off with a warning.  But if you start talking back they will be more likely to give you a ticket.  Generally if you give them the respect they will give it back and you wont have any problems.  Also if they ask you to stop then stop dont be like those assholes that run or fight and argue.

Of course, I would do what the officer asked without hesitation. I just don't want to be approached by an officer in the first place. I have not heard any stories of Boosted, Inboard, or Chinese board riders getting approached by officers because electric skateboards are legal and I have never heard of the 1000w limit being enforced. That said, I think that you would have I higher likelihood of getting approached if you were riding around on a Trampa MTB. 
I am debating between two different builds, do you think one looks more illegal than the other?

Yesterday I went for a ride on some awesome trails I found in the woods. Pushed the board a bit more then usually. But no where to it's full power capasity. Suddenly one motor braked and I could'nt move the wheel. Noticed the belt was super tight and some small rockes was stucked between the belt and pulley.. Removed them and the motor could spin again. But not like it used to. There was resistance while turning it.(like when a motor is shorted) Tho the motor was not over heating. I could hold the motor can in my hand without burning my self at all.. 
Did get home with my board but drove like walking speed on the way back..

Today the motor moved like it should. No issues there. Did however open it up to see if road debris/rocks where stuck in the motor  but it was clean. No sign of a short either. Shaft is also straight.

Any explanation what happened? I would say that it got over heated by the tight belt when rocks got between the belt and pulley making the shaft and bearing stressed. But since I could touch the can without burning myself I doubt it.
Maybe the bearings got heated insted and temporarly made it hard to turn...?

It's Maytech 6355s sealed motors with less than 100km on them..

You need to use that bms as charge only. Leave the discharge lead empty. There are wiring diagrams for this on the forum..just do a search. It is very common practice and the cheapest way to balance large packs.

Anything  from bestech will be of good quality.  Since your using it for charge only just match the max current that your charger and cells will be charging at. The one linked will do 25a charging so that should have plenty of headroom for you.  Not sure what your charging with or the max c rating of your cells. I went on ebay and got the cheapest bms I could find since not worried about discharge.  I might have paid 13.00 each and I bought backups but supower and bestech have good reputation for quality.

First post here so be gentle :)  I've been lurking a while trying to learn as much as I can.

I'm looking to build my first board on a little bit of a budget.

My first plan was to build with meepo style hub motors but the more I read the more I think that its not a good idea, I see a whole lot of snapped/failed trucks and other issues on here so I think I will give them a miss.

I have enough 18650's to build a 10s3p pack and could possibly go to buying another 10 cells to make it 4p.  I have a 10s BMS already (But i'd have to run charge only as its not rated enough for this use on output).

I'm looking to DIY an enclosure and I think someone is 'donating' me a longboard to use that seems to be good enough.

It seems to be the general feeling that a VESC is the right way to go for motor control so I'm looking at a single motor setup with something like a 190kv hobbyking motor (suggestions welcome).  Of course I'd need a mount and pulleys etc.

Am I heading down the correct path? Would it be worth me getting the extra cells to make it a 4p pack?  I'm getting confused by the online calculators as to what range I can expect.

Oh, and the other thing I'm really struggling with is what controller to use.  Seems to be good and bad reviews for just about every option.  I'd really like it to be nunchuck/small.

It is better to buy more expensive cells than an extra 10 cheap cells. Longer life same amperage. For single motor vesc max constant is 27 amps I think so even a 2p would be acceptable with 40 amp bursts with high quality cells. 190kv is perfect for 10s you are right.  The calculators are pretty accurate but don't ignore the voltage under current draw of the 30q giving more range at higher speed. I've seen someone say 6-7 miles per parallel group at 10s which lines up well with what I have seen

18650 charge rate question:  My cells are 2 Ah each.  They have a max charge rate of 1C so 2A per cell.  But if I build a 4p pack with them what is the max charge rate?  Still 2A or is it now 2Ax4P = 8A?

I don't have a set budget really, the more I spend the longer it will take for me to get everything.

As for cells I have 30x 25r already from another project that I can build into a pack.  It wouldn't be too much to add another 10 cells but if I'm going to get around 270wh I think that might suffice?

Hopping on build number 2, wanna keep it real simple this time instead of: designing and milling custom stuff, welding a whole battery from scratch like last time, etc. I am a freshman engineering student at purdue university so i have access to a lot of machines. I was looking to make a hella flush board cause why not it looks cool lmfao. Plus with the big wheels im using, plus a 1/4 or more board thickness out of water jetted aluminum it would look amazing, and i would mount it so the hanger can still move for turning. Electronics would be in front of the back truck, but nice and tucked away. 

So parts wise, I was wondering if this would work. I dont wanna waste any money.
Battery: 6s 4000 mah 65c discharge graphene battery https://hobbyking.com/en_us/graphene-4000mah-6s-65c-w-xt90.html

BMS: I want to use this for charging only, I also dont know how to wire it so it doesnt use it for discharging but ill read more on schematics later https://hobbyking.com/en_us/6s-li-ion-10a-pcm.html

Hub motors: 
http://www.diyeboard.com/dual-hub-motor-8352mm-900w-75kv-power-truck-front-truck-kit-p-423.html

Esc / switch / receiver, its all built into one looks okay to me, dont wanna get another vesc cause im looking for plug and play this time around plus this is recommended for the hubmotors http://www.diyeboard.com/v11-dual-hub-motors-sine-wave-foc-esc-speed-controller-p-608.html

also, if this esc is off will it discharge my battery / do i need an additional switch? 

Once i get going on the project ill probably make a separate post for further questions

With li-ion, yes, as far as I know.
I know some commercial boards use fast charge such as the Raptor 2.

However for lipo's usually they have like a 'safe' charge of 1c. 

''While I agree, THERE IS NO DATA, to suggest that when using a high performance, computer controlled balance charger that the batteries suffer in ANY way as a function of charge rate. Remember, a state of the art LiPo can sustain a 30C discharge rate and peak of 60C. Asking it to handle a 3 or 4 or even 5C during the charge cycle is not a big request..... UNLESS, you just plug it in and hit it with high amperage via an old fashion charger.

High rate charging MUST be done with computer controlled balance chargers. You should not connect a LiPo to traditional charger and charge above 1C. Computer controlled chargers hit the LiPo pack hard early in the charge cycle then taper off as voltage and thus resistance builds. ''

Hi all,

Simply put, is it wise to get very high end stuff for a first-time DIY or is it better to start small and build another board(s) after you've build one that's cheaper?

I'm skipping a lot of details when asking this, so if I need to elaborate on my personal scenario just ask. Long story short, I have a lot I want in a board but I feel as though the risk of making such a high end board is inherently risky for a first timer and I'm hesitant to build it due to its high price tag.

Thanks!

It's a good point you make, maybe you don't want to begin with the 2000$ board as first diy board.

What a good option is that you make a board from around $500-600, that will be a board with legit hardware like good trucks and deck and wheels + deasent battery and maybe a vesc.

That way you can experience the feelings of an electric skateboard and decide you like it or not. While you make that board you will gain a ton of experience and will be better prepared for your high end board

This is what I've been leaning towards, having something top-notch is something that I'd ultimately be inexperienced with outside of building it. Here's some of the reasons I found that thought troubling, however:

One motor means less torque. I'm on a relatively flat campus, but there are a few notable hills in which I frequent. I can't say what the grade on those hills would be, but I know the estimate I have based on [this](http://calc.esk8.today/advanced/) calculator isn't stellar to say the least. I don't want to have to rearrange my route to classes everyday.

One motor means less braking ability. I'm in a city, and simply put I'd like to not be hit by a car or have my board sandwiched beneath one.

I've heard of single motors forcing the board one direction since since the motor is only moving one wheel. I've also heard that this is nonsense, however.

These are issues that I don't really know how to get around with a single drive. If you or anyone has experience and knows any solutions / remedies that would be immensely appreciated!

I only have a little experience with single motor  builds but I can say the torque steer from accelerating or braking really isn't noticeable. Perhaps if you really gun it or brake hard you will feel it but under most conditions it will not matter.

The steering to one side is not happening. Some people think of my mono drive that it will hapen but it didnt

and breaking can still be good! I have a mono drive with a 3m belt (go figure) and my breaking is still gucci haha

I dont know how steep your hills are but I think it is possible (go with a 6474+ motor and 15mm 5m belts) I think you would be good to go :slight_smile:

first of all, your first built will most likely be not your last built...
It´s an addiction ;) so don´t worry so much.
I wouldn´t cheap out quality components, so better go single with good quality products, than dual with cheap shitty crap.
If you once where driving dual, you don´t want to go back to single drive...
But, this does not mean that single drive will not give you enough power. If you get a 6374 or 6384 motor you will most likely get more torque than you need. 
Just make an easy calculation
Let´s say most 6374 motors rated to 3200W.
Standard VESC/Focbox (without special cooling cases) rated to 60A max current
you will run max 12s so 50.4V fully charged
to put all together you come up to 3000W which is quite a lot.
If you go dual and want the double power, you also need a battery which can handle double, so 120A constant, which is a lot a lot ;)
The advantage of dual is just that you split the load to two VESCs and two motors, which will let them run cooler and you will get a better break force for sure as there is more mass working in the motors.

This comment was great, thank you!

A quick follow up, however: I fear putting too large a motor on a single drive will cause the board to be more prone to overheating. Would you (or anyone) know ways of fixing this, namely cooling methods for the electronics?

I had thought of putting ventilation holes in my enclosure, but unsure if the loss of protection from the elements outweighs the cooling.

If you afraid cooling issues than I would say get a focbox and this
https://shop.3dservisas.eu/products/single-focbox-case-without-cooling-fins?variant=5988890443803
but they unfortunately out of stock and I don´t know if @Kug3lis 
will continue to produce this cases.

If no, than mount your focbox with the heat sink outside of the enclosure, good airflow always better.
Get a good battery min 4p 30q, the bigger the cooler it will discharge, too.
The bigger the motor, the better it can give away the heat, so the cooler it runs. So I wouldn´t worry about the motor.

And finally, you can always adjust your settings in your vesc or focbox.
if you don´t push everything to the limits it will for sure not overheat, aaand in case it overheats, your vesc will reduce power output by it´s own till your components cooled down.
PS: if you have an opportunity, get a sensored motor as well ;)

you don´t need to wrap all battery in fishpaper.
use it on the positive terminal.
In case you bend your nickel over than also on the top under the nickel strips.

Brand new board builder, so patience please! I have a chinese dual hub motor ESC that has "HeroS" branding on it. I bought it on ebay and it has zero documentation. Everything works except the remote for it is terrible and I've had to resolder the NRF24L01 board several times. The traces are pulling away and I'm afraid that the next time I look at it hard, the remote will quit working.

Are the chinese NRF24L01 remotes in any way universal in protocol? If so is there a place where I can find what the protocol is so that I can build my own arduino based remote and ditch this piece of trash?

The orrsom is a full set and pre cut with all screws, sets and buns.
The other is just the tray.
If you look in parts used at the orrsom you will find the battery tray 10cm again 
So the dimensions should be the same.
Think it’s a mistake in the description.
The tray is 145 for the inner and 200 for the outer measurement

Not so much reviews here yet.
The dual 4.20 has cut outs with 12s and the single 6.6 problems with the e-switch beside it’s bulletproof.
So likely the dual 6 will be good too if they used the same components. In case the switch is shit just use your own e-switch.
Check if they still have a promo running.
They had something like 50$ off if you write them in Facebook plus like there side or so. Don’t remember exactly

I commute daily with my board, with my 100mm MBS wheels from home to work my battery percentage would be around 50%-60%. When I put the AT wheels I notice on my battery indicator I could see it draining down then once let go of trigger it starts to go back up.

Yeah it’s as easy as that. Get a Bluetooth module from AliExpress or better a metr modul (if you have some money left). If there no cables on it you need to solder a 7pin jst 2mm plug on the modul. Connect it to the uart port (that only port with 7pins). Get any app you need, pair both and you good to go. 
Just take care that you buy the right model for your phone (Android, iOS)

If you have troubles anyhow than just search or ask here. There plenty of explanations.

I've bought some fuse wire. Was not sure about what amp it would fuse at. This is the answer I got..

This numbers are a bit different.

I would guess that operating current is the current you can load on for ever.
The fuse current is just a peak when it burns through. Like after 2-10sec or so.

Yeah I saw that too. But it depends on how many cells you have in parallel, and max possible amp they can draw.. So if I have 80amp max from a 5 parallel cell. 17 amp is somewhat close to that..
I guess you are right with "operating current" .. :)

I thought to choose the fuse wire only according to the capability of your cell. You want to protect your cell, so if you have a 30q cell for example you could get up to 20a constant. Means i would look for a fuse wire which is above that, maybe 30a. I don’t want to fuse it out without reason. This 30a are not related to how many parallel groups I have as it’s only the fuse for one cell and not for the parallel pack.

That’s how I thought to calculate the right fuse wire. If I‘m wrong please correct me. I need to know it for my next built 😜

Yeah i‘m through this thread.
In some way it’s for sure related to each other.
Mean if you divide the pack through your cells or just calculate it for one cell it’s the same in the end.
Just I think if my pack can handle 80a constant I don’t want to fuse it to 80a. As the fuse should burn when I exceed it for a short time with a higher current and not with the limit for a longer time. Just imagine you climp a mountain and draw 80a. Your battery is fine but your fuse can burn. If on the other side i short the battery i have idk maybe 200a for a second and in this case the fuse should trigger.

What are some decent options for hub motors these days? Not direct drives from Carvon. Looks like hummies aren’t coming back on the market. The torque boards hubs have been sold out forever. I know there’s a bunch of cheap models like the winboard other amazon finds. Are there any good high performance hub motors I’m missing? I tend to overlook my options sometimes.

@Chase this one are the TB hubs, direct from factory that's why the cost less than half. You can read my review about it in the thread. I closed the first GB round but I can still add one or two sets, not more because they are in productions now and once ready they will ship them. I said in production becuase we are getting the new version having same motor but better PU lock system. To me the hub motor out there after hummie and raptor probably. In the price range they are now not competition with the others :wink:.

Okay, not sure if this is a noob question (which is why I am assuming it is) 
I'm going to build my first eboard, and I would like to use a dual drive belt system. I've read a fair bit, but I'm not sure wether I need to use a FOCBOX, a VESC6 or a VESC4.12. I would like the board to be reliable and last a long time without whatever ESC I decide on burning out. Is a FOCBOX worth it if  I'm not planning on spending more than £500-600 total on the board initially and plan to upgrade it? 
So that's question one, which ECS is more suitable to use?

Question 2 - if I plan on using a dual belt drive system, do I also need to double up on whatever ESC decide on using? Or is there a way I can hook up a dual belt drive system to a single ECS and it remain reliable?

I hope this question didn't cause too much pain to the experts whom read it, thanks is to whoever answers !

Which esc you decide to use depends on how many current ayou want to run through it. Focbox or Vesc 4.12 will be plenty for most people. 
I’ve heard many good things about focbox so I suppose if you want a smooth riding experience, get a focbox.

For a dual belt system you need 2 escs yes. However there dual escs on the market too. I thought flipsky made one

I am in the process of putting together my first build and I have the [flipsky 4.12 dual vesc](https://flipsky.net/collections/electronic-products/products/dual-fsesc4-12-100a) coming in the mail. When I go to program it, do I program it as if I had 2 separate ESC? Or do I only need to program it once through the master?

Focbox has proofed to be reliable in bldc and foc till max erpm of 60 000.
Most advantage of the vesc 6 and derivates is that they can handle a higher erpm than the focbox.
For sure it always depends what you want your board to perform.
There is no way to use one esc for two motors, but in the last time some dual esc came out or will come out soon. Like the focbox unity and Flipsky dual 4.20 and dual 6.6.
I think the cheapest option at the moment is the Flipsky dual 4.20 but it’s just out and tested by our community. There are some cutouts with this vesc at 12s...so if you want to run 12s I guess you need to look for something else.
If you search here there are some group buys and recommendations. There are many different vesc 4.12 out on the market which you can get from 70-100$

The FOCBOX unity looks sweet but adds another £100 to the price tag, would it be worth having a single FOCBOX for now on a single belt drive system and upgrading it when I have had some experience (and more mooooney) with what in doing?

If so, any recommendations for reliable single belt drive motors?

Yes definitiv a good starter oportunity.
Single drive should give you already a good torque.
Look for hobbyking sk3 6374 for unsensored 
SK8 for sensored or torqueboards 6380.
The kv i would choose somewhere inbetween of 130-190kV. Depends on your max speed you wanna reach.
I assume you will go for a 10-12s battery, right?

20A x 5 = 100A.so 50A each vesc. 40A to play safer. If you use standard 4.12 until maytech or Torque board better set at 30A max. If you use more advance vesc it's ok 40A. In both of the case it's a lot of current at 12s!
Actually if you have old type 4.12 vescs they do have problem to handle 12s.better to go to focbox or vesc 6 based

I think my battery cutoff settings are wrong. I'll check what they are when I get home but I changed them from stock settings to what I thought they should be based on some light reading I had done but I'm starting to think it's not accurate. I did a few rides on the stock settings and was able to get around 30 miles out of it (based on how much was left after I rode, did not run it out of juice. For context yesterday I rode 17 miles and had 25% left.

It's a Torqueboards 12s4p with Samsung 30q's. Do these settings also affect the battery percentage display included in the pack or does that give an accurate reading regardless of the battery settings? What should I have it set at?

First timer here trying to do a budget build. I bought a Hobbysky 24V/36V Dual Motor Drive ESC with the following specs: 

Rated Voltage.....24V for single belt motor / 36V for dual belt motor
Current...………..16A
Power...………….380W(24V)/580W(36V)
24V ESC must use a voltage above 24V, the maximum voltage can be 29.4V (the ESC won't work below 24V)
36V ESC must use a voltage above 36V, the maximum voltage can be 48V (the ESC won't work below 36V)

I also bought ZXMOTO Electric Longboard Drive Kit: 
![ZXMOTO%20Electric%20Longboard%20Drive%20Kit|500x500](upload://to3JeRaJ58YaLTkiH0UfyDweXgg.jpg)

I wish I had of found this sight before buying parts but now that I'm here; is there a way to make this work? I know the 16 amps is going to be a problem but was wondering if a bms would protect the ESC via the discharge leads? Which brings me to my next problem of deciding what size battery to build based on being able to find a 10s, 12s or 13s 48V bms. I went to bestech for the programmable bms but apparently you have to call them and I've also been to AliExpress but could only find a 13s bms for 48 volts. Before looking for a BMS I wasn't even considering a 13s battery because I have a 6s balance charger. Any help would be greatly appreciated. 

Thanx in advance, 
Clint...

If you have parallel plug from the battery to the two vescs than no, both get 12s but the max amp you can draw from your battery need to be divided to two.
So let’s say your battery can but out 80a, you can set your bat max in each vesc to max 40a.

Battery cut off start at 3v.

What exactly is your problem?
You bought the dual esc or the single, or is it one for both? Sorry don’t know this esc, but if the specs say max 48v than you can run it max at 11s. 12s with 50.4v is already too much.
You can find any bms on bestech. Just write them an email. No need to call, they replay usually within one day but they have a min order of two pieces.

I was going to charge a 12s to 48 volts using the balance charger to get the most life out of the batteries and the most power out of the ESC and motors but I'm not sure if the amperage would eventually kill the ESC so I thought I would add a bms if it limits the amperage to the ESC? I was also looking at getting the 13s BMS from AliExpress so that I don't have to buy two 12s's from bestech since I'm not sure if the amperage is even limited by a BMS to the ESC...
Maybe I'm just making this more complicated than it needs to be.

Thanx Octave. None of the specs on Amazon say anything about the max cells in series and no paperwork came with it. So I'm stuck with 42 volts 37(nominal) and the only question is amperage now? Will a BMS limit the amps to the ESC as I add parallel stacks?

Adding more cells in parallel increase the amount of power that can be drawn. It doesn't mean it will be pushing out those amps when not wanted. The higher the potential amp output is the better to a certain extent.

Hi all, 

I'm in the end game of picking parts for my board and I'm looking to buy the final parts this weekend. However, I have run into a few hiccups that I can't seem to find answers to after quite a bit of searching. That being said, here are my (hopefully final) noob questions. :sweat_smile:

First and foremost, the wheelbase on my [board](https://www.ehlerslongboards.com/complete-longboards-skateboards/34-free-ride-revenger-sliding-series.html) is 21" and my current choice of [enclosure](collections/battery-enclosures/products/12s2p-battery-enclosure-v2) is 19.88". According to the picture below, that means I won't have enough space to mount my motor underneath. I have looked for a smaller enclosure of the quality of the one above and haven't found much. If anyone has suggestions / links to an enclosure that can fit this wheelbase and a 10s3p pack that would be amazing! Otherwise, I think might have to settle with a 10S2P. :slightly_frowning_face:

![932a1e2f06b3f74e9b87e7168e768c0167bd9f33|690x305](upload://gVOuVnMnD9Ojj5MWfMilJs9yt0O.png)

Second, I've read a lot about [this BMS](https://buildkitboards.com/products/bestech-bms?variant=7201537687582), but have yet to find a definitive answer as to whether or not the E-switch included negates the need for a separate solid-state switch like [this one](products/on-off-power-switch-electric-skateboard). Despite its larger size, I really like this because I don't need to bypass discharge (as far as I understand), so if I could confirm that I don't need a separate switch for this that would make this choice a lot easier.

Any and all input is welcome. Thanks again!
```

It looks like you want to make an xt90s loop key. In that case it doesn’t matter to which side you connect the red wire. 

Otherwise if you look on the xt90 connector you can see on the side a + symbol on the flat side or a - symbol on the curved side. 

Happy eskating.

Just plugged in a foc box I bought about 8 months ago for the first time. No combinations of the 3 wires will make the wheel spin properly in either direction. It makes crazy noises with some of them and studders hard. I tried a different focbox on the motors and it works perfectly. Any thoughts? I thought maybe the solder from one of the bullet connectors came off?

I have bought a a pulley and belts kit from Ebay for my MBS ALL TERRAIN wheels. However when i putting them on my caliber 2 trucks, the whole in the pulley stopped the wheel from going on fully, it needs to be a thicker bore. I'm in the Uk and not to sure what to buy because i don't want them not fitting. Many thanks in advance

Yeah I was testing it using the bdlc tool. I honestly think that one of the sensor wire bullet connectors has become unsoldered. I’ve seen very similar problems when a sensor wire wasn’t plugged in all the way. I’ll usually just use the front and back arrows to make sure the phase wires are in order before configuring the whole vesc. I tried to do motor detection as well but nothing is solving the issue. One of the combinations of orders of the threes phase wires makes a loud screech for like 10 seconds (much louder than any vesc screech I’ve heard in the past.

No, only if you change phase wires for example it can be that the motor doesn’t spin when you use your remote. In this case just run motor detection again and all is good. 
As long as you don’t change anything in your setup the motor detection results saved in your vesc

I would say you need some sort of antispark switch to go between your battery and your focbox.  And generally batteries do have a xt90 or atleast an xt60 coming off.  That is easy to change out just snip of the bullet connectors and solder on the xt90 connector.

Depends which cables in which place.
If your battery can output 80a but you run dual motors, your cables after the parallel plug to the esc don’t need to stand 80a, only 40a.
The same inside of the battery. It’s a difference between cables you use for parallel and serial connections.

I don’t use ack app but you can set this app up for single motor and dual.
What you have on your board and are the settings shown in the app for one or for two motors?
At 80 degree your vesc start the restrict your power output to not totally overhead.
If you set your bat max for single drive to 60a that can happen easily. 
Reduce the settings to 40a (35 if it’s a vesc with hw 4.12) or get a heatsink case from @Kug3lis if you have a focbox, than it should be ok.
Motor max i would also reduce to 60-80a

The speed is calculated by the settings you input in the app (depending on your gearing and wheel size)

The down part is the average usage of power, current etc. 
It’s calculate on the values recorded during your trip

Bud. Please listen. Your battery looks unsafe. I don't think it has 12awg silicone wire, the soldering looks bad.

You don't know enough to be stabbing around in the dark right now. Do two things please:

There some parts of the pack which I would worry about.
![image|652x500](upload://uHzGrkwd4ftpJBeUqiJMvx47Dpa.jpeg) 
The isolation ring shouldn’t be damaged, just as one.
I think you read a lot here, so you should know about the necessarity of fishpaper in battery packs.
There was just one more LiIon fire some days ago. 
https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/catellated-tesseract-hummie-hubs-v4-stewii-dual-escape-12s4p-30q-psychotiller-enclosure/68072?u=andy87
And the pack from @deltazeta was made not that bad.
You can ask him how it feels when your board goes up in flames after just some days...don’t want to know how much days and money he spend to make such a beautiful deck...

Do you have some backstory from the cells?
Is this guy here on the forum?
Do you think you have an opportunity to return the pack? 
If yes take the advice from @brenternet and return it please

The fact that there has been used gorilla tape makes me nervous. Don't know much about gorilla tape but pretty sure it SHOULDN'T be used in a battery pack. Also there is no fish paper around positive ends of the cells

Yes I do. The batteries come from an e-bike. 
He said the batteries were only discharged at 1 amp each, with a overall capacity of still 3350 mah per cell. 

He isn’t, I met him on a local website called marktplaats.nl

I don’t think he will take it back. Let me ask.
I got it made specially in this setup...

Some background info about the pack builder:
He has built his own e-bike which he uses everyday to get to school. He’s got a awesome working place and I’m guessing his dad has a technical background. And lastly he’s 17 years old. 

Let me take the rest of the tape off and I’ll provide some better pictures
@brenternet the wires are the same that the e-bike battery used.

You know that this cells rated for 10a?
If you do than ok, if no, than you should understand that with your 4p pack you can get max 40a or 20a per vesc in dual out of it.

It looks like he used some kind of isolator.

Getting pictures from the inside too would be too much a hassle. I’m afraid I’ll break connections or wires.

Don’t get it wrong just say my opinion, but why you have a battery with 40a and than a bms die 80a? It’s not wrong but you could get a smaller and cheaper one for that too.
And one thing I don’t understand about the guy who made you the pack. If he or his pap has an background in electronics, why they use tape to cover the batteries? 🤔
If they would as min use tape which is made specially for batteries...or heatshrink...

Oh I thought of this a long time. I wanted a bestech bms cause you gotta take care of your batteries like babies right? 

Could have bought another one but then I would need a extra anti spark.
Turned out around the same cost so that’s why I got the bestech

I really have no idea.

Write that one off my friend really.  You can't in all good conscience sell it on.  Even stripping it down and selling the cells could be problematic.  Soldering to the terminals like that can degrade the cell considerably if not done correctly and judging by the rest of the build it wasn't done correctly.  Live and learn.  If I thought you could safely use it I would suggest using it as a test pack on your bench but looking at the terminal soldering I wouldn't even have that in the house.  Salvage what you can from it wiring etc and bin it responsibly of course.  Then go round the little shits house and steal all his lego.  What is it with bloody kids and crap batteries.

You don’t see in this view for how long, but yes in one point you was drawing 100a motor and 30a for your battery.

If you have a 2p pack you definitely need to lower your bat max values!!!
Your battery can’t handle more than 40a max.

The charger is out of stock.
The motor is sensorless.
If it’s not a problem look for the sk3 series on hk.
They proven to be good. If you want sensored look for the sk8 motors from hk.
Remote, go with the gt2b. 
Yes it’s a big remote, but there are a lot of mods from it with which you can make easy a small and handy remote from it. One of the best remotes you can get.

Hi, Just set up my new HK VESC because the old Enertion broke after 2 years. Somehow, while configuring the settings in the BLDC it must have accidentally switched to FOC mode where I did a couple of motor detections, still not recognizing I was in FOC mode. The motor spun spastic and came back with an error. A second or third trial was kinda successful. I discovered the "issue" relatively late in the process and switched back to BLDC where the motor detection was successful straight away. Everything works fine but afaik there was a strict procedure switching between the modes to prevent a potential DRV failure. Anybody here remember this process??????  

Cheers

With 12s and 190kv you on the limit of the vesc you want to use. With 10s it would be perfect.

Hello,

I apologize if this was posted somewhere else but I couldnt find an answer.

The Turnigy motors are pretty popular so i ended up getting one,
https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-aerodrive-sk3-5055-280kv-brushless-outrunner-motor.html

I also ended up getting the:

https://hobbyking.com/en_us/gear-set-with-belt.html

However when I started to put everything together i realized 2 things, one the diameter of the motor shaft is much smaller than the small pully, and two the motorshaft doesnt have a key. Upon reading around people suggest using a grub screw with loctite to lock the pulley on however i am concerned that the pulley will spin off center.

The motor comes with a bunch of odd accessories that I dont know how to use.

does anyone know if i am suppose to use these?

Yes it’s a 6mm shaft on the motor, so you will need a motor pulley with a 6mm bore too.
Something like this 
Schau, was ich auf AliExpress gefunden
https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/b58nHKCS
But it’s for belts till 20mm width, so I guess you need a bit a smaller one.

All the equipment is for installing the motor to a plane or copter.
If you have a motor mount you will not need it.
Can you please double check that there is a o-ring on your shaft, which hold the can in position?
If yes than you definitely don’t need anything from this parts.

If you didn’t have a motor mount yet, make sure the one you buy fit to 5055 motors. Most of them made for 63xx motor and as they bigger they don’t fit to your motor.

The motor pulley you can fix with a scup screw and blue or red loctite, or only with green loctited.

Hi all,

I work for a construction company and looking for advice on purchasing electric skateboard/longboards to help us travel in a sewer pipe.

it is a 4 ft diameter pipe with 2 inches of water in the bottom. I don't want to make the guys walk it. Theres pipes hanging from the ceiling every 60ft or so as well.

thinking an electric longboard with rubber wheels is our best option... hoping to be able to do it for 700$ canadian each.  off the shelf, as we will probably be needing to use them in a week and a half and i dont have toime to order and assemble parts 

would anyone havea any suggestions?

Your going to want to look for something with large off road wheels. as standard urethane wheels become very slipery when wet.   most of the shelf builds arn't fully water proof so you may need to attack it with a silicone gun.

It’s not necessary to have two xt90 plugs between your battery and your anti spark switch.
If your antispark switch doesn’t have a fuse, I would add one in line too.
I guess your vesc is the dual Flipsky right?
If no, than you need to add one more vesc to your drawing, plus xt90 parallel plug

You are correct. The Flipsky is the Dual vesc.

The anti-spark switch does not have fuse

I will take out the extra xt90 connection b/w battery and anti-spark switch. The fuse would go on that positive wire b/w anti-spark and esc correct?

Flipsky Anti-spark and DIYeboard switch. 

I bought the 10s5p kit from DIYeboard (http://www.diyeboard.com/10s5p-360wh-battery-esc-dual-motor-belt-drive-power-truck-kit-p-590.html).  The ESC died.  I'm replacing it with a flipsky dual 4.20 and picked up an anti-spark while I was at it. 

The switch that came with the board has 4 prongs.  The anti-spark has 3 connection points.  Can I make this work?

No way that’s it’s a BMS , and I would never run batteries without one, (much less leave the responsibility to a esc). It’s better to have Speed Contoller do speed contoller things rather than have it try to do everything . Separations of responsibility and redundancy is should be #1

I've been trying t figure this same thing out along with a couple others and this thread was the closest to what I was trying to find. I just blew a 10s3p 30q randomly out of nowhere that won't charge or discharge properly (or at all anymore FML) so def want a BMS on any build I do. 

I have a raptor 2 coming this week and I know they have a BMS. But I also have a spare R2 SPACE battery coming I plan to use on my main DIY builds and want a BMS, enertion hasn't been much help getting the answers I need related to this so figured the community could help a lot more.....

- Since the SPACE cell from Enertion doesn't come with a BMS is it fine to use any 10s BMS?
- Is there a simple way of adding a BMS to the space cell or is the battery going to need to be disassembled, wired with BMS, reassembled back together, wrapped, and then put in heat-shrink  again...?   
- Any BMS anyone recommends since Enertion won't at all (really think they should cell BMS to people who buy a spare battery)
- Anyone know if the spare battery comes with an enclosure too?

Any thoughts, advice, or input is welcome.

I don’t know the space cell, but if it’s a 10s than go for a bestech 10s bms like this 
https://eskating.eu/product/10s-bestech-bms-80a-10s4p/
Or get it directly from bestech. If no balance wires on the pack than there is no way around to open and install new balance wires.
If there are than you need to figure out if the order fit to the new bms you want to use

How to use the spare battery then, plug and play with the current bms (i don’t think its working that way), or if it’ll needed to add another bms, better to know the size of bms that would fit or find the same bms used by raptor 2?

Hi, I have a noob question :) (so I guess that's the right topic)

Does all pneumatic wheel vibrate?

Man I have had a strange one   On vesc tool when I configure one vesc (Split ppm) the same values appear when I configure the other one even though I'm setting them up as individuals.  Never used to happen is it a vesc tool peculiarity?  Or the normal because I've always had to assign the values individually with split ppm.  confused.

actually not bothered really because it works.  and its cool.  less tapping.  as you were.

You CAN pair any VESC based ESC via CAN. Should work just fine. We have coupled HW 4.12 with VESC 6 without any problems. Socbox is a 4.12 with direct Fets.
Just make sure to fire them up simoultaniously. If you fail to do so, the black ESC will fry it's CAN transciever.

Ok, heres a quick question for all you electrical people out there.  I have had an idea of how I could safely merge two batteries balance leads when the nominal amp discharge is 120A but max charge is 40A.  

This is because when you connect two 6s lipos in parallel to make a 6s2p, each cell balance connector needs to be merged with the 2p's balance connector - and if their voltages are even slightly off, one of the batteries would flood the other to bring them into equilibrium.

So would putting resistors inline with each balance lead when connected, limit the maximum amperage flow from the batteries max output (of 120A), to the max charging rate.  or am I just sleep deprived enough to think this is possible?

It took me a lot of time but I think they are almost balanced now.
The question was more like _"can it be really perfectly balanced? Or is it normal to have a bit of vibration at high speed"_.

The other problem I had was that my tires were crap (from a very old MTB that I upgraded). I changed 2 tires and it made a hell of a difference. I'll change the 2 others soon, and hopefully my board feels like a cloud :slight_smile:

and no, you don´t need to switch on your board.
the charging wires go directly to the battery (with the bms in between)
but the bms is always "switched" on. So it´s like yo connect a blance charger to a lipo pack, there you also don´t need to switch on anything ;)

Just in case the pictures aren't legible I will explain my diagram as well.
18awg positive wire from battery directly to charging port
18awg negative wire from battery directly to B- on BMS then have 18awg wire going from CH- directly to charging port
12awg positive and negative wires from battery to Flipsky Anti-Spark Pro switch with on/off plug.
Have Flipsky Anti-Spark switch connected with XT90 to Flipsky Dual FSESC6.6 controller
Also have battery capacity meter wires connected where Controller connects with anti-spark.

I plan on shortening the wires as much as I can to be able to fit in the enclosure. For now I am just trying to confirm my wiring is correct before I start cutting and soldering. Any insight would be greatly appreciated.

My planned build will have:
- Dual 6354 motors
- UNIK core series dual caliber mount (123mm crossbar)
- 15mm evolve wheel pulleys
- Caguamas
- Standard caliber II trucks

You may have guessed my issue already. I probably won't fit that all on the axle of standard caliber II trucks. Say 60mm of wheels + 30mm of belts + 123mm mount crossbar + 15mm mounts + 20mm nut threads = 247mm, standard caliber axle is around 253mm so not much wiggle room there. I'm probably missing something because when I've test fit, it's definitely looking like I won't even break the nylock in the axle nuts.

Should I get the extended axle calibers? Can someone explain how noticeable it would be if I used an e-caliber on the back, but the standard caliber on the front? Will one inch total axle difference really be that noticeable? And if I did use the extended axles on front and back, wouldn't the wheels on the front just have excess axle sticking out the side because the hangers are the same size? Do you stick a spacer between the wheel and the hanger or something?

Will changing to the BKB modular wheel pulleys help at all? The combined wheel and pulley bearing saves space, but I could always take this from the end of the hanger anyway. I don't think the width of the evolve pulley is my issue, it's the 15mm belt width.

Should I go to slimmer belts? I don't really want to as I've already bought a bunch of 15mm parts.

Should I try for the 113mm unik crossmember? If my motors were 54mm exactly they would fit. Recent QC problems to one side, I had my eye on the Flipsky 6354 motor. Their website says this is 54mm in length, so maybe it could fit? But on Aliexpress the length is listed as 57mm, which would definitely not fit.

I'm changing my wheels, so also the gearing.
Going from dual 6374 190kv 14/38 2,71:1  on 110mm wheels.
My wheels will be 97mm, and I can choose either 16t 2,38:1 or 18t 2,11:1.
I would like to gear more for speed, but I think 2,11:1 gearing would be too much for those motors heat wise
and maybe the torque loss would be too great? I'm a light rider - 70kg.

You wheels should not factor in to this as they are on the axle and not the hanger which is where the mounts and everything are.  Caliber hangers are 184mm I would get the wheel pulleys to see how much room on the hanger they cover.  You can always push them out a bit with speed rings.  The e caliber just has longer axles so you would be able to push the mounts to the very edge of the same 184mm hanger

Some of you are going to think this is funny but I’ve become frustrated trying to sand my deck to a finish with no tiny scratch marks. I know absolutely nothing about wood work. I’ve hand sanded, but even after 220 grit I can still see tiny scratches in the direction I sanded (after painting which is more frustrating). Tried getting a random orbit sander and a foam interface for the curved parts. Somehow this made it worse in some sections, these orbital sanders are really shitty and make scratches on curved surfaces even with this interface pad. I’d stop here had I not spent so much damn time on a simple task..... any ideas?

a few things first you should always go with the grain of the wood never acrossed. Which is why it looks worse with the orbital sander cause it is spinning in a semi circle.  Every once in a while you get a piece of wood that has knots in it and they are a bitch because the grain goes around the knot.  Now as far as grit of sandpaper goes 220 is the general go to to sand in between either layers of paint or clear coat because it roughs up the surface enough for the layer on top to adhere to the layer on the bottom.  Now 220 is still rough as fuck in terms of sand paper on my builds I used 800-2000 grit.  Now as far as painting goes are you using a spray can or brush on. Spray will lay on smoother if you have a steady hand or a spray gun/spray paint handle to give you even pressure on the nozzle.  Brush on there is technique and type of brushes involved.  If you are really after the no brush strokes look you need a high quality brush like this

Thanks you for this response. I have been using spray paint. I always sand with the grain when hand sanding, but I can still see the scratches once Ibstart painting. So are you saying I should hand sand with a Grit higher than 220 prior to the first coat of paint to avoid this? For some reason I thought going higher would make the deck too smooth for paint to adhere.

Was this a blank uncoated deck that you are using?  I would go higher like 400 then step to 600 and then try spraying it again. I also don't normally go up and down the board just down so it is just one stroke of sanding each time.

Hello guys here I am again:

I want to make a new board with a modular battery design just like the landwheel so I can borrow an extra battery with me and change them when one is running low.

I am thinking of replicating the landwheel quite a bit because it is a simple design, the only thing I am not sure of is the connector.. To connect the battery to the electronics I need a connector that can plug in and out fairly easy (like a xt90) AND most importantly be waterproof, better said splash proof.

So do you have any sugestions on a connector that is easy to connect and disconnect and is waterproof? is an xt90 a good candidate?

Just joined so pretty sure I count. So here's my questions I'm looking to convert my cruiser, my current issue is I have 56mm wheels and finding a motor to fit is proving difficult. Any suggestions?

My deck is 7.4" and I'm running Indy 11 109 trucks I don't really want to change any of that, the wheels may be small but soft 78A and the build works really well for me. 

Main purpose for the conversion is to handle going up hills getting to work save getting of and walking, I want to be able to skate normally on flats and downhill.

Any help would be great can give more info on my current setup and pictures if you want just ask.

I don't think it's possible to find parts for that unless you go DIY and make it yourself. 

You could either buy some bigger wheels, trucks etc. and only keep the deck or start from the bottom and keep your cruiser the way it is.

Please help I would like to go about 15-20 mph with little to no sluggishness on minor hills

There’s 2.1mm and 2.5mm dc power plugs. From experience the 2.5mm jack will fit the 2.1mm plug but not vice versa. Actually... that might be the wrong way around.

Two questions.
 1)  [Would this charger](http://www.batterysupports.com/432v-44v-504v-4a-lithium-ion-lipo-battery-charger-12s-12x-36v-p-167.html) be acceptable for 12s BMS charging

2) so as some of you already know, I am merging 4 Lipos into 2 6s packs, to then merge into a 12s2p pack. 
so to merge two 6s lipos I have decided to put a 1Ohm resistor between each balance lead, in hopes that when each cell is merged, if the cells are slightly out of balance, it wont dump the max output of the battery into balancing the other cell, which would kill the other battery.

![99C01923-0E45-4CD4-AA77-BB6837137DAC|666x500](upload://xfbVOoMCOEFST2tZ4XDkUbhDkAm.jpeg) 

Each resistor is rated for 50W, So I hope that this will work, as I know only basic electronics principles

@Kug3lis Whats your thoughts on this trick to protect the batteries. Obviously ill bypass the resistors for bms use, just use these for inter cell balancing.

edit: updated the wiring diagram for what I plan to do

Ahm why you put resistors on balance leads? You balance out each pack to exact voltage and connect them in parallel and no output will be dumped anywhere... Everyone is using like that for ages no need to reinvent wheel. Plus resistor inline will make balancers see lower voltage than it is.

EDIT based on ned drawing, you still have path for current to flow from cells to one another, also main current will flow through main leads the moment you connect them together. BMS will not balance each parallel cell as separate cell but as single cell

(time to delete my post as I just read your edit)
what do you recommend then if my balance charger is struggling to balance the cells to 0.08V+/-   hence why im trying to limit the inter cell transfer. or would it still work if they are that far apart? I am worried about damaging my batteries

edit: someone mentioned having a master and a slave cell, would that work?

Well talking about damaging i am running 12 packs in 12s3p without any bms just fine ;) Exact same grafene packs.

Regarding edit don't add any resistors that will not work and just harden bms job. If you want to have better balancing get bigger BMS with bigger bleed resistors not add resistor on cells.

tbh I mostly wanted a bms for the charging capability, but I also ended up killing 4 multistar 16000Ah lipos without any reason, so im just playing safe.

wait! Could I use the resistor to balance the cells ignoring the bms, but when I come to wiring them to the bms I just remove the resistor, that way I can make sure each cell is balanced exactly to the other cells voltage.

But I am right in thinking if I merge the two cells when they are 0.8V apart it is likely to kill one of the batteries since they can only charge at a max at 5A const.

also, what did you think about the [Charger](http://www.batterysupports.com/432v-44v-504v-4a-lithium-ion-lipo-battery-charger-12s-12x-36v-p-167.html)? yay/nay?

Nothing will get killed. Balance charge each of them to full voltage with some cheap charger and then connect them in parallel.

Charger is OK. Graphene ones can charge much more than 5A... At least 2C like minimum.

Need advice on the best overall choice for me between 12s/10s/8s/lipo setups before i splash cash..

I want the top end speeds of a 10s or 8s setup but if i did go for 12s and within the esc settings reduced the top speed about 30%, i will get more range from a 12s but may possibly run into overheating issues if my escs are fully (pelican 1040) inclosed. .???

What you use now?
There is only bldc tool and vesc tool you could need.
Bldc Tool works with the old firmware.
Vesc Tool with the new.
Guess you use vesc tool at the moment.
So you can download bldc tool and use it or flash the latest firmware and use vesc tool.
If you have a focbox just make sure you choose the right hw file (410,411,412) and be sure your powersupply is now stable. You don’t want to lose connection while flashing the firmware 😉

Btw I have received 2 flipsky 4.12 vescs and want to test them if they work. I am going to read the whole vesc starterguide and stuff like this one:
https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/new-vesc-user-read-this-complete-walktrough-of-the-vesc/2980
but I am a bit in a rush because I want to be able to get new ones from aliexpress if they are not working (you know you only are able to do that for a few days)

So question is: can I run a vesc on my lab bench powersupply (max 16v and 3a) just to test them with my remote just by plugging everything correctly in? or do I first need to do other  stuff (like programming it already) to better prepare it so it will not break?

4.12 vesc should run from 8V.
If you want to spin up motors you need first run a motor detection. Means you need to hook the vesc up to bldc or vesc tool.
Not sure if 3a enough for running the motor detection, but this you will find out by trying 😉

I'm still super confused about Li-ion battery cutoff voltages. I think I have mine set up wrong since I'm only getting about 15 miles range with my Samsung 30q 12s4p but got 30 miles out of it before on unknown cutoffs.

Max voltage per cell: 4.2v
Min voltage: 3.2v

Multiply that by 12 since I have 12 cells in series and it should be:

Max cuttoff: 50.4v
Min cutoff: 38.4v

I currently have it set as such to prolong cell life:

Max cutoff: 42.0v
Min cutoff: 39.0v

I don't think this is right because my Metr.pro constantly changes these vesc settings among others so I removed it from my system. Help would be greatly appreciated.

Doesn't seem correct to me either. You got a 604,8wh battery which means you use 25wh/km. Your max cutoff is set to 42v but right above you says it should be at 50.4v. That's a pretty big difference. Maybe it has something to do with that?

What you mean with max cut off?
There is only cut off start and end.
LiIon can be discharged till 2.5v per cell.
The standard settings with the ackmaniac sw are cut off start at 3v and cut off end at 2,8V.
If you set it to 3,2 and 3v it’s still a nice headroom till 2,5V. Try this settings and look if you get a better range. If no, than check you pack, maybe one cell or parallel group went bad.

Your vesc can output only 0.5a if I remember right. 
Plus you don’t want to risk a cut out because of faulty hardware you connect to the vesc.
Better to use a step down converter or Bec like this:

is it a pre build pack?
you should know how much amps you can get out of your pack.
for this you need to know the cell type used in the pack.
if it´s just a 5A cell, you shouldn´t ask more than 15a from the pack

Project wowgo upgrade! |Stock wowgo | Paris v2 | Wowgo hub motors |6.4 Panasonic(I think)| Stock ESC

So I have been looking a lot into upgrading my wowgo2s. It is a great eskate but I want something with a bit more torque and hill climbing ability. I am going to be doing this all in little pieces. I was looking at getting a focbox unity right now and later switch to a belt drive system. Any thoughts? Would the focbox unity work with my stock set up and remote?

It will probably be better than it is now, bit not a ton.  Those hub motors are just week, not much you can do to make them strong on torque.  

Gear drive is relatively new, but its definitely worth it.  I use a set from @Kug3lis that mount to TorqueBoards  218mm trucks.  They are torques best friend and fassssssssst too.

I have the racerstar 5065 on my deck now I do have dual motors so that does change because you get more torques with 2 motors.  The motors you have are not rated to put out 60 amps they are max current 46A. And if you have sixshooters that is alot more effort needed from the motors to get those going so you should be using a dual set up hence why evolve duals on there AT setups

I would look at getting either another racerstar to make it a dual set or a single sk8 because they are sensored.

I still would do sensored as if you are in binding you will have to push start and then get your foot into the binding.  
Go with the sk8 and just make some phase wire extensions cause the phase wires are super short on the sk8's for some reason

Yes, you don't have a key hole, but you can use a grinder to make a flat surface on shaft , at least 2 flat surface for you can use a gear with screw like this: https://www.amazon.com/Lannmart-Electric-Skateboard-Pulley-Accessories/dp/B07HSVRPBT   (you have three holes for motor gear)  and you can use a glue for the screw dont go out......

the accessory that came with the motor, when I saw I was (WTF?) how I use?, but I found how to use three days ago XD

When you tighten the nut, the connection with the shaft is very powerful, but you don't feel safe with just this solution (off course) just saying how to use.

Yeah, pretty much, but I continued onto explaining into a little more detail.  
When I was asking I told them how I manufacture extreme sport equipment, that gets absolutely covered in mud, dirt, and a high possibility of animal products - and how I was recommended by an ex-cop that I should try calling up and find what the CS cleanup crew uses.

At the moment my current solution to this problem is changing the minimum value so 100% breaking  is about half of way down the throttle and not pulling the stick all the way back.

hard to explain, does anyone have a solution to this??

If you in the ppm settings you can just push the trigger of your remote to the max, than to the min and than push the apply button.
After that your remote should be centered.

@Andy87
Yeah I did that but it doesn't centre it. In the vesc tool, it has a middle pulsewidth but the bldc tool only has min and max

unforunately i don´t have a maytech remote.
but i know with others you can adjust the center position via trim buttons on the remote.
my gt2b i can center by pushing the fail safe button on the receiver while the trigger in middle possition.
the aps remote i have calibrates the middle position always new when switched on according to the actual trigger position.
on the maytech there is no trim or set button? also not on the receiver?

add on, just read your first post again...
if i remember right, there was a pulswidth setting in bldc tool too. just a bit more tricky as you need to find the best value by our own.
if that´s not working, why you not update firmware and use VESC tool?

@Andy87 I was using the Vesc tool and it cooked my Focbox and when I tried to get a warranty replacement, they said that I voided the warranty when I didn’t use the program provided by them. Apparently the vesc componentry is different to that of a focbox and it can break the focbox when you use a program designed for vesc not focbox. There isn’t any buttons on the receiver and only an on/off button on the remote. Annoying.

For my first build I have an idea of mounting everything to my deck, with Velcro and/or screws. The enclosure will support everything and keep the Velcro engaged. Components will be protected by a thin layer of closed cell foam. This way I can remove the enclosure cleanly and everything stays in place.

My question is, what to do about motor phase cables and sensor wires? I had planned to route these through holes in the enclosure, using rubber grommets to keep things tidy and somewhat watertight. However if I do this, I won’t be able to just take the enclosure off cleanly.

I’m thinking I will create some jumper cables that will be permanently fixed in place on the enclosure. The focbox unity will connect to the cables inside the enclosure, and can be disconnected when the enclosure is removed. The other end will connect to the motors.

What do people usually do?
```

## \#2132 Posted by: Andy87 Posted at: 2018-11-02T08:24:54.455Z Reads: 88

```
the problem with the jumper cable is, that you non the less need to connect and disconnect the wires each time you want to remove the enclosure. If you use mt60 connectors that would work, but with bullet connectors which you should cover with a extra heatshrink or electric tape after connected, it would be kind of time consuming.
you could place your unity in the enclosure as it´s only idk 180-200g if i remember right. with it you only need to disconnect the main power leads.
or 
you can place the phase holes to the total up of your enclosure, so that they open to the end of the enclosure.
if you use 5 or 10mm neopren tape instead of rubber to seal your electrics you can than just route your cables along the deck.

If they were new you could, this is what people do to create battery packs

The problem if you got second hand batteries is that you wouldn't know the state of health of them, this would mean the real capacity and current capability of them could be different

If one had been abused more than the other it may heat up or fail during discharge, if they don't discharge at a similar rate with similar capacity you could have an in rush of current from one to the other

I recently finished assembling a 12s4p battery pack of Samsung 30Qs, for use with a dual 6374 setup, and I'm feeling a bit troubled about not using this as efficiently as I could have. I don't think that I will be able to draw as many amps off the pack as I'd like to, in order to take advantage of my motors.

I soldered the nickel strips on instead of spot weld, so I guess I could undo them and possibly buy more batteries and make a 12s 5-6p pack, but uncertain if I'm worrying over nothing. My motors are 192KV so 12s is the voltage I have to run it at to be most effective, but still have concerns about amperage capabilities.

Why ineffective?
You have 80a for the battery. 
That’s 40a per vesc/focbox.
If you have a hw4.12 vesc without heatsink the bat Max is maximal 35a. So all is good.

For sure all depends on your setup in general.
If you have an emtb and a Vesc6 you could want to have more power but besides I don’t understand why it should be inefficient to run a 12s4p

If you want to balance charger 4 6s lipo packs in 12s4p config would you have to open up the cells to pair up parallel cells (connecting negative and positive terminals for each serial cell group) in order for a BMS to do it's job? Or can you simply use the wires sticking out of the lipo packs?

Also, once you have your BMS installed correctly, can you use the same types of chargers you would use on a Li-Ion battery? 

And finally are all Wh from LiPo packs pretty much equivalent range-wise? Example: is 10v 12ah the same as 12v 10ah for the range?

you don´t have to open up anything.
you can use the main leads coming out the pack to set the packs in series and parallel.
you use the balance wires out of the packs to connect ot your bms.
if you don´t know how, just use the search function. There are a lot of information about it on here. 

You can use the same charger you use for LiIon and Lipos. Both have the end voltage at 4.2V.

Probably a stupid question, but when setting up Max battery current on a Master vesc in a dual setup. Will it split the total battery current between the two VESCs or double it? Example Max battery current setting = 20amps. Does that provide 10amps per vesc or 20amps per vesc?

The blue wire should be split and put in series with all of your balance wires, as well as bridging the main output wires of your battery. Brown cells should work, maybe skatan red would be better for this application though?

Of those two... Go with the TB vescs. The Flipsky ESC4.20DUAL 100 burned up on day one for us. At least with TB vescs you might get some time out of it. Use conservative settings.

Help, I've looked a lot of places for a good and budget friendly mountainboard.  I'm willing to DIY it, as I have experience in model aircraft and cars, but everywhere I look has conflicting ideas.  I want to ride it on the streets, but also be able to take it on the trails with a few friends who ride mountain bikes.

no.
you need to split the max amps to two controller by your own.
so if you have a 80A battery, you need to set the master to bat max 40 and the slave to bat max 40

You can look here, there sometimes nice boards on sale for a good price.

You could go with a trampa or a MBS board and have a second set of wheels.

you need to do the motor setup for the master and for the slave.
if you don´t close the VESC/BLDC-Tool you can just download the same settings you used for the master to the slave without to type in everything again.
Non the less you need to run through the motor detection for every vesc/focbox by there own.

With bluetooth you need to have canbus  The bluetooth reads off the master set up so yes.  Also traction control will only work on canbus because the set up has to be as one.  With split ppm you are effectively utilising 2 separate systems.

Hello! I've got a few questions that need to be answered.

1.
I plan on making a battery pack using 10s3p (so 30 cells, the cell been the INR18650-30q), I was told to use a normal 10s 36v 30A BMS but would that work and how would I hook it up? Would the battery pack just need to charge it or to charge and discharge?

2.
I was going to use a single motor ( https://www.banggood.com/Racerstar-5065-BR5065-140KV-6-12S-Brushless-Motor-With-Gear-For-Scooter-p-1110304.html?cur_warehouse=CN this one). How well would this work? Would this be fine for my Eboard?

Yes there was. Get a focbox and you good to go for 12s FOC.
Bms for discharge advanced,
Safe you from over charge your battery (if that’s good or not is an other story)
You can use the built in e-switch (if there is one)
So no antispark switch needed
It protects your battery from over discharge and over current (like a fuse would do too)

While soldering, my iron melted the lead going to the 8th series, and shorted with the 12s positive output. This caused a loud pop, a bright arc and a black discoloration around the wire. I desoldered the melted wire and put heat shrink tubing around the expose part, but when trying to test charge it, the batteries voltage isn't going up. I have proper voltages being applied to the BMS from the charger, but I don't know how to further test this. I'm almost finished with my first build and would really not want to resort to having to order a new BMS from China and wait 2 weeks :expressionless:

Long phase wiring is generally ok (wires from vesc to motors) but long battery wires can be problematic.  That said lots of prebuilt boards use long battery cabling routed from back to the front with no issues so a standard longboard deck will be fine.

Its not really an issue but long battery cabling can cause resistance and you sometimes need to add extra caps on the vesc to compensate but thats in extreme cases.  Take the meepo for example.  The battery cabling is 12awg and runs up through the deck at the front and runs through a channel to the rear.  Works fine.  I have one running focboxes and 1 running hk 4.12 vescs with no issues at all.  As I said on a normal longboard it will be fine to extend the battery cabling.

You are going to have to be a little bit careful with bite because the evolve trucks are double king pin which moves the hanger further out than standard reverse king trucks like the tb 218's  Basically if you stick to a design similar to the evolve bamboo you should be ok.  Just make sure that the cut outs are far enough back to accommodate the wheel at full lean. My advice would be to pick a deck that has large cut outs and if you get bite then remove some material from the deck.   Difficult question to answer tbh.  There are literally hundreds of options so hopefully someone can chip in with some real world experience.
Welcome to the forum by the way and good luck.

Naaaah not so fast ☝️ I want you to understand what’s going on because it’s easy and a basic thing (sorry @dareno 🤪)
Long battery wires can cause an inductive voltage spike which could kill your vesc (you maybe know the specs for vescs say voltage spikes may not exceed 60V)
With this said, there are capacitors on each vesc and focbox. Capacitors work against induction caused voltage spikes. 
The longer the wires, the higher the spikes can be. The closer you run to the max voltage, the more likely is it that you fry something (12s instead of 10s).
There are some things you can do to lower the effect of induction 
Get extra capacitors to the ones you already have on the vesc/focbox 
Use bigger wires
Route the plus and minus wires as close as you can to each other.

Ok and lastly, as long as you around 50cm and don‘t use a 14s battery you should be good with the stock capacitors on your vesc

## \#2286 Posted by: Andy87 Posted at: 2018-11-18T06:30:04.184Z Reads: 108

No, not really more work.
Just use 10awg (or 8awg if you have the space)
And don’t use 1m long cables and you should be good.
I have 8awg cables 60cm long on 12s and had no issues so far.
The capacitors are just an option, but I don’t think it’s necessary in your case.
The capacitors would needed to be wired parallel to the ones you already have.

Edit: no 10s is super fine! You better with 10s instead of 12s. It’s a 42v instead of 50.4v so more room for voltage spikes till hit the 60v limit

[/quote]

This is normal, until you start to approach the end of charge.

A "CC/CV" charge (aka - a lithium charger) starts in CC (Constant Current) mode which kicks up the voltage a lot [until desired current is achieved, printed on the charger], until voltage reaches a set level (usually 4.20V per cell) then it switches to Constant Voltage mode and holds there until current drops below some threshold

everything is interchangeable with everything in this place.  Whether you can do it is another story.

Sorry forgot to mention, Flipsky 6.6 dual. And technically my battery is rated to 150amps but I'm shooting to stay within the limits of my bms 120a continuous discharge. My electronics are sufficiently cooled with a custom aluminum heat sink I made, it has 20x the surface area of the flipsky heatsink (which I removed). I can push my batteries limits easily with the thermal headroom I've added.

Edit: My electronics are sealed and waterproofed with a twist. It's really hard to put into words so just take my word for it that it won't get hot.  I'll be posting a completed build thread in a couple days!

I think it’s personal preference.
People with discharge bms will probably use the build in e-switch.
People with a e-mtb where the battery is mounted on the top probably use loop key.
People who want something reliable and give a sh.. about how it looks will use loopkey 
People who want to have a stealthy look or waterproof will go for a push to start button

So I read up on PPM vs CAN. I can see the pros and cons between the two. My question is if I were to do dual receivers instead of PPM and use CAN to get the telemetry functionality of the Bluetooth module, will this setup work? I know there's somewhat a redundancy in this but I'd like to have a failsafe just in case one of my focbox decides to malfunction.

Thanks in advance

Namasaki was able to bind 2 receivers w one remote. It was one of those trigger type. Not g2b. I believe it was the mini remote. [Here](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/mini-remote-with-2-receiver-setup/66767/3) is the link.

So instead of using the servo splitter y connector. I'd do 2 receivers bound to one controller. So each Vesc will be setup identical as both masters. No slave Ves. And use can bus to use it for telemetry using the Bluetooth.

You can definitely bind 2 mini receivers to one handset but as for telemetry across canbus I'm not sure.  I think that uart only works in a master slave config.  Might be worth a thread really.

What is the formula for calculating the time it takes to charge a battery pack given the cell arrangement and input power supply?

For example, if I have a battery pack that is in a X series and Y parallel config (12s4p for example) and a charger that outputs V voltage and A amperage (50.4v @1.5A for example), how long will it take to charge?

Edit: I've seen a variety of online calculators for this, but they are all dealing with single cell li-ion batteries since that is the most common use case. Is it possible to just use those calculators and divide the resulting charge time by the number of total cells your pack has?
```

the capacity add up with the parallel counts.
so if you have a 4x 3Ah cells in paralle it´s 12Ah in total and would 
take 1 hour with a 12A charger to charge it fully... or 2h with a 6A charger and so on...
probably it will take a bit longer if you have a BMS installed.
The blancing process takes some time and that you can´t calculate.

Power calculation question:

Say I have a 10s5p battery = 36v (or 42v full charge) and 10,000mah
If I had two 500w motors (1000w total), will they only last under 30 minutes at full blast?

1000w / 42v = 23.8Ah
10,000mah / 23.8Ah = 0.42hrs = 25.2 minutes

(Assuming no voltage sag)

Is this theoretical calculation correct?

Planning on using Caliber II (44) trucks and haven't decided on the wheels yet. I think I want to use at least 90mm wheels. 

How about Abec-9 bearings? How are those? As they are included with the board. 

Still deciding on the electronics...
Definitely a FOCBOX and probably a 190kV TB Motor with a 10/12S3P made of Samsung 30Q's.

What motor mount should I use with the Caliber II's?

[/quote]

Don't know if it's best to use 44 degree or 50 degree trucks. And don't know if it matters when choosing motor mount.

edit:
quick reddit search.

    50's give you quicker turning and deeper carves. the 44's give better stability at higher speeds.

    My friend has 45* Precision Bears on his freeride board and with the correct setup of bushings, he is able to carve and turn super sharp anyways, while still being able to bomb hills at 70km/h.

    It's all a matter of opinion and feel.

Is my battery dead ?

Hi guys, my charge port waterproof cap went off while riding and some water made it in my battery enclosure :slightly_frowning_face:
The battery was sealed with heat shrink PVC but you can definitely see there's an issue here: ![46507556_2107589259554914_1503746386238111744_n|281x500](upload://o7N4vw44dQhZYuU1joANnTkLnp.jpeg) 

Wiped it off, cleaned everything, board worked for a day an now it won't start again.
1) I suppose this is dangerous as it could short circuit.
2) How do I safely check if the battery is fine ? Can I check tension at the xt60 connector ?
3) Here's what it looks like without the pvc shrink. I know we can't see much but didn't want to risk anything before knowing if it was safe to rip it appart more than this: [Dropbox video](https://www.dropbox.com/s/jureeihdjpri52u/video-1543690452.mp4?dl=0)

I there's an issue with this battery, can I rip it appart, clean each cell and reuse them in another pack ? They have about 75-125 cycles I'd say.

In accordance with US electrical codes the max current for circuits utilizing 12 gauge wire is 20 Amps. However, 12 gauge copper wire is capable of handling much higher currents. There is something called fusing current, the current at which a wire will melt. For 12 gauge copper it is about 235 Amps.

Yes, you need to remove both screws to get them out.
Theoretically you can get them out also if you just dismount the top screw and bend the deck over, but that’s not so good and easy.
If you make one side after the other all is good.
Sure take care but on mine no of the springs ever jumped out. If you removed one side, the second is very easy.
You want to drive without dampas or just change to different color?

Not sure if it’s working with the base plate you have. But usually there two positions you can mount your springs.
They mounted usually on outer position.
If you mount them on inner position (more close to each other) the turning radius will become smaller.
With the time the dampas also lose there stiffness and turning will become more easy.
Or like I made on the beginning, you can drill some holes in them and with it they become more soft too

I am building a 2 in 1 AT/107s holypro with 16 inch ultimate trucks

Holypro carve or Holypro 35° MTB deck?

If you ride without bindings remove the dampas but add a bit pre-tension. On my carver I actually have springs only in inner position but it's scary :laughing:, it turns too good. Before I had yellow dampas also in inner spring position, was more controllable. But I'll switch to elastomere dampers like on my MTB.

Then just remove the dampas but take care at higher speed because of speed wobbles. I don't know yet how the elastomere dampers feel without bindings.

Oh shit you are right. I only go the ultimates to save weight and use normal longboard wheels  but these is no space to drill a hole to get a more inner position. 

Worse come to worse, I will swap the front trucks with carver trucks and keep the long atb trucks in the bak hahaha

@rich @Andy87  Wait a second. Just read this on the trampa website for ultimate trucks

ULTIMATE ATB TRUCK
Super Strong &amp; MEGA Lightweight (Forged &amp; CNC'd) Hanger - POWDER COATED
9.525mm Mega Lightweight SOLID TITANIUM Axles - 16 Inch Wide
Mega lightweight ULTIMATE CNC Baseplate - Powdercoated
Dual Sprimg Position - INSIDE for easy Carving OUTSIDE for High Speed Stability .

Look at the last sentence. Must be a misprint no? Probably is considering the spelling mistake haha

You can ask via e-mail when they are available but the thing is that Trampa gonna change (I think next year) all spring trucks to dual spring position. Also the new Holypro deck has both holes.

Does your baseplate have 2 spring positions like in this picture?

8" vs 6.5 tires?

Ok so currently im running 8" tires on my trampa but im considering getting some 6.5 treads next as they seem to be pretty popular but im wondering what the advantages are? and why they are their so popular?

I know on urethane wheels the differences are pretty clear so i'd presume it similar with tires.. for example, smaller = lower top speed, more range, better acceleration ect but what about ride comfort on tires? how much difference is there in ride comfort between 8" and 6.5 tires? and also what kinda range would i gain by going down in size? (currently getting 10 to 12 miles on my 8inch tires)
```

6.5“ nice for urban carve as the trucks shorted.
If I remember right you can also inflate the 6.5“ more than the 8“. Harder wheels, longer range.

Im talking about the tires only specifically not the trucks because iv got the 12mm vertigo trucks & hyper hubs, so wondered what advantages and disadvantages are there between an 8inch and 6.5 inch tires because a main reason people use bigger urethane wheels is for better ride comfort, but with proper proper tires id imagine there's not a lot of difference?

If you have smaller wheels you can use them at shorter trucks without wheelbite when turning.
So it’s connected to the trucks too.
Sure you can use smaller wheels on bigger trucks, but not always bigger wheels on smaller trucks...one of the reasons why the 6.5“ wheels exist. Not specially because they better in some way...
The only thing I know about is that you can inflate them more.
But I wrote that before.
If you drive 6.5“ pneumatics with 40psi and 8“ with 40psi you will probably get the same range out of it.

easiest way to check would be to check with a string acting like a belt wrapped around the wheel pulley to the motor pulley and then take that measurement and order the correct belt.  I do not believe that your calculation is correct because going by that you would need a 269 belt and that just doesn't exist but a 270

Hi all - I have a question regarding decks. I've read a ton of literature on here, but with no real life experience, I'm still a bit confused and don't want to make a large mistake on my first build.

I'm 20y/o, 5'6, 115lb, used to be very athletic, still for the most part am but my body is kinda falling apart as well.

I've never skated on a skateboard manually, nor electronically. The manual will never happen. I also live in SouthEastern Ohio, where there is no real skateboard community... For a long ways.

Anyways - power wise, I was going all out of my first build. I have two 6374 170kv sealed maytechs coming in, a unity, and was planning for a 12s3-4p 30q batt.

Now - here comes my question - I wanted to do a short deck. Like a jet Spud or Tayto. I know I will have to use very wide trucks for this setup - but is this a dumb idea for my body type? I want to be able to cruise on the board relatively relaxed around campus, but also be able to do some serious carving type stuff when I get the chance. Would looking into a 36-40" longboard be better for what I'm after? Am I just overthinking this and I should just for a Tayto and then see how things feel?

I'm just questioning the shit out if things after somebody stating that a Tayto with dual 6374's will shoot out from under you, lmfao. 

Any input is greatly appreciated.

I'm just guessing but your are girl and worried about your size vs the power of the board,  which if you are welcome but there are plenty of girls here that skate and they have no problems.  There are guys here that are 200+ and dont have problems on the boards. With the stats you provided it will be a powerful board but if you take your time and learn to know your board and the speed you are comfortable with you will be fine just don't hop on the first time and go balls out.  You may be more comfortable on the slightly larger deck just because there is more room on the deck

Well she’d probably go tits out. 

With those numbers it would be a very powerful board and if you are just looking to cruise I’d advise a longer deck. 

Deck choice is very difficult for the first time. Go to a skateboard shop and try standing on a few and push kick once. 
Even better go and find out if there are others around you and see if you can join them for a groupride.

Haha, I'm a guy, but all is well. 

@sayekim - hard to explain, but right now, for some medical reasons, getting out and socializing/finding people is kinda really difficult for me. I realize that doesn't help my situation at all haha. 

I do know for a fact that there are no large groups within 30 minutes of me. I regularly travel 3 hours round trip to a hospital (twice a week) in a much bigger city - but I'm typically pretty tired at the end of things and I obviously don't know any way to meet people in such a large city I'm otherwise not in. I guess trying to find a forum member who lives there would be my best bet. 

I definitely am looking to cruise and I think a longer board would obviously be great for that, but as I'm going to use it for class I'm trying to keep it as short as possible while still doing what I need. Tough situation to figure out I guess haha.

Late answer but both are possible, it depends on how much flex you like. For offroad I have a 16ply (I'm 74kg) and also a 14ply carver deck which is very flexy. Without bindings a 15ply seems good for you. If it's too stiff the deck isn't flat when you stand on it.

Not 100%sure but I think it was the smaller blue poti which you need to turn.
Just take a multimeter and connect it to the output of the charger and measure the voltage.
Than turn the Poti a bit. 
If voltage change you know it’s the right one.

I lowered the EOC voltage but soon after that the charger stopped charging, not working anymore.

Why do you need to lower EOC voltage? A few reasons are:

1. Your bms is cutting power when battery is full and you brake
Fix: bypass your bms for discharge 

2. You want to increase the lifespan of the battery.
Fix: use the battery at it's maximum capacity, the lifespan is already pretty high

3. You want to lower a 12s to 10s charge
Fix: get a new charger, no charger could go down that much

I was doin this with my 10s, only charging to 41.5 thinking this would increase lifespan of batteries. So your thinking it won’t matter if its charge less because the lifespan is still high ? Sorry for confused question but it’s cuz I wanted to do this with my 12s charger and somehow adjust it to only charge at 50v instead of 50.4v

It will work but DON’T DO IT.

Much better to use banana plug or something other but don’t solder them, it would be pure mess after that if you want to work on the board or even to change your drive system.

I am dying to ride it, I am planning to go without bms until it arrives.
[/quote]

Wouldn't recommend that with li ion mate.  Different with lipos because you can balance them with the charger.  Unless you have perfectly matched cells then you could potentially cause damage and even a fire.  Not worth the risk imo.  If you charge it without the protection of a bms then do it outside.

The pack is already balanced.  It's been charged with evolve bms all the time. 

Plan is to still charge it same way, just to discharge without bms.

Every DIY is different.
Even if there are videos it will be not the same if you don’t just copy what is shown there.
All the basics you can find in the forum here.
Just spent some time reading and researching.
I was there in the beginning of the year too.
Didn’t have had a glue from anything.
But things change fast if you read through the forum.
First friend should be the search function in the right top
Sencond friend will be us. If you have a specific question just start a new topic and i‘m sure people here will reply fast to it.

in diy you will not come around some soldering.
That’s just not possible. The only way would be to find somebody to make you your build after your wishes.
If you want a boosted clone than there is probably no better way than to get a @Eboosted spit enclosure. I think he could also make the battery for you in the shape fitting perfectly inside the enclosure.
The controller wiring is not a big deal, but you need to solder some xt90 plugs and etc.
Get a focbox unity and a charge only bms.
That would save a lot of space.
The unity has a build in switch so you don’t need a separat anti spark switch or a bms for discharge( those bms usually bigger).
I also call @dareno @mynamesmatt @moone our Australien connection. 
Maybe they can help you with infos where to get things local so that you don’t need to sell your arm and legs for shipping and import.

Yep, I even considered making a tutorial series on building one because there really weren't many out there. Even on the ones out there, I felt like they didn't go deep enough or provide quite enough information. It only occurred to me later that there's a reason for that. They all vary so much and doing that detailed is hard really. Even then, it shouldn't be told step by step because this isn't necessarily a diy that should be taken lightly, especially when it comes to batteries.

I agree and thus why I never went farther than considering making a video. Other than the fact this is my first build and I don't have an established channel or equipment. Lol, it just takes a bit of effort to comb through all the information and get a solid base on what to do. Which is why the idea of a video is favorable to many, like you said. That being said, I rather have too much information and sort through that than not have enough. Which is really neat actually considering how young this sector of skating is.

Yeah if you can’t find the time and effort to read everything there is related to what you wish to build then I don’t think you should be building and you should just buy a raptor 2.1, lacroix, kaly, or longhairedboy. 

Lol. Go buy yourself a longhairedboy and see what kind of trouble you can get yourself into. 
😂

The hardware is not foolproof yet for you to just buy the parts and connect them together and be on your jolly way. Even if they were you need to know what can go wrong and learn from other peoples mistakes and make your own too.

Unfortunately, the fact you "don't want to do any soldering" is a touchy one. The fact you don't want get a 60w soldering iron from bunnings for like $50, some solder and watch some youtube tutorials is a bit sad.

That was the reason.

I’ve set my VESC cut off end voltage to 34V (10s battery) because I heard it expands the life span a lot.

Do you know/think its actually true?
[/quote]

Yes, it is true according to Battery University. However, it's like trying to expand the lifespan of the fuel pump of your car from from 15 to 18 years by driving it less miles a week, everything else on this old car will fall appart first, and if for any reason, in 18 years you still drive the same car, then it will be just because your have feelings for it.

I, myself, would rather drive my car all the miles I want at it's full potencial and if the fuel pump goes bad just replace it, and continue enjoying life without any sacrifice.

Enjoy your board and ride it like there is no tomorrow

When you guys mount your batteries and ESCs, do you stick them to the deck or to the enclosure? What’s your favorite mounting method for electronics? Pics would be helpful!
[/quote]

Tomato tomate o  to be honest.  Its about ease of construction.  You can set up on the deck a lot easier than on the enclosure.  You can get it all solid with velcro and use the high grip stuff not cheap rubbish then foam the enclosure so it all holds in there with no movement at all.  Vibration is the enemy with esk8.  It destroys everything eventually so take it away.  Make sure everything is solid connection wise too.  Double up the shrink over bullets and basically remove anything that can potentially fail.  It will still fail but minimising the risk is the best way to start,  Good luck.

I have 4 of them.
They run very good so far, even in winter.
There have been some reported problems with there 6384 motors, but the 6374 seem good so far.
keep in mind that they have a 10mm shaft (not like the tb motors)
the shaft is also shorter.
so if that all is no problem for you than yeah go with them.
customer service is also very good as far as i can say.

Edit: Just have seen that this the seald version...
I have the unsealed version. the ones you linked don´t have sensors, so you need to think what you want.

if you want sealed and sensored 6374 motors than you can have a look at unik boards.

You will have an effect called cogging.  Its a shuddering on start up. The esc does not know the position of the motor. Thats what hall sensors do.  Once the motor is moving it stops.  It is very slight and the tiniest movement will smooth it out.  As much as a hip flick to move.  Where it becomes problematic is on hills but a quick push and you're good.  Going balls out from a start stops it too.

Hi ! 

Just figured out that my belt drive was making a lot of noise and I don’t really know if it is actually normal, here is what it sound like :  

https://youtu.be/3_ooF3MElUY

Belt seems to be working well though, and the noise is less intense when there is some weigh on the board.
Any idea ?

Hey dareno, riding a loaded vanguard with single 6355 motor from torque boards,16t/36t setup, torque board vesc and a 10s2p lithium ion battery.

Hey all... I want to add a connector to my charge port wiring to make it easier when removing my enclosure.

What’s a good option? I have XT60s and two pin JST connectors on hand. However I’d rather something less bulky than an XT60 and I fear the two pin JST will melt and short the battery.

Battery is 10s3p Samsung 30Q

dumb question, but it would certainly save me alot of headache. 

When you do motor detection, and save it, can I then transfer those values to another vesc by just opening the XML file(or does that only handle the other values)?

So... apparently that type of connector (JST RCY) is rated for 3 amps. That’s gonna be “fine” for the regular evolve charger I’m planning to use - but should I not be building some redundancy into this? If I were to use a fast charger I’d be running 4 amps.

It just seems a bit dodge to me. I put a 5a fuse on the charge circuit, which I think is a good rated fuse to use for a charge circuit.

Yeah you will have to be careful but I have mine running a 2amp with that jst.  My 12s 4 amp charger runs a slightly bigger 2 pin which i can't find right now.  More important is the wiring,  connectors are usually rated way below their actual ability.  

[quote="b264, post:709, topic:74332"]
and for charging:

26AWG: 2.2A continuous
24AWG: 3.5A continuous
22AWG: 7A continuous &lt;-- usually this one
20AWG: 11A continuous
18AWG: 16A continuous

Because your 20c can be a real life 10c or something.
There is no specification after which c-rating need to be measured. 
So in fact every producer could write what ever he wants.
If you take the half or one third of the c*capacity=max current ,you get close to what lipos really can output.
In your case that would be below 22a which is really not a lot.

Doesn't matter what the application is, you don't want to jam your things full of loctite. A little bit goes a long way. It isn't super glue where it'll lose its effectiveness but it doesn't add any extra benefits. In fact, if you ever need to take the screws out, you'll have a harder time.

So to answer your question. A couple of drops on the end of your screw should do it.

I know that ain't funny but last year I also got 9.525mm joke bearings from them. They didn't spin at all. After cleaning and removing the thick almost dry grease which took hours I applied speed creme and they were spinning perfectly. Well after mounting the shields the joy was gone, the shields were too big and gave massive resistance when spinning.

However, I would write Ted about this problem, I got new replacement bearings.

This summer I bought 9.525mm Trampa bearings again and they spin fine, I also have bearings from MBS like @Andy87 suggested  which work, too.

As for water proofing, I think grip tape doesn't let any water through anyways so it will be fine.

Its not so much the actual velcro thats the issue.  Its the adhesive backing that lets down cheap velcro.  Industrial strength will have a very strong adhesive and this is good.

i think most just solder an extantion on.
as you don´t want that, you can buy some awg wire and the right jst plug fitting to your bms and just crimp new cables.

Alright another dumb question: If I want to do motor detection, but I have nothing to mount it on, do you think it would be ok to just hold the motor by its phase wires? :rofl:

I can understand why not.... but I dont think it would be doing and *real* amount of damage :man_shrugging:

I have a tb mount somewhere in a bin.... is it worth digging up? :thinking:

Hey ! 

Does it might be bad for the batteries if I « compress » them a bit in my enclosure ? 

Like it’s not compressed too much but still compressed  :laughing: 
Wires shouldn’t be shorted because isolated correctly, the BMS can move a little bit so I added some foam to prevent everything from moving without compressing too much the stuff.

Look like this ![image|666x500](upload://tmLaUPMJwpP7SqhZbdJjVYRbKlA.jpeg)

can you take the picture from a side angle? We cant tell how much the batteries are sticking out :)

generally though, some compression is fine, and should honestly be good for the cells as it prevents them from bobbling around

Why is kugs installing the motors?  You will have to strip that stuff down at some point.  Best learn it all now than later.  Man seriously get the gear to you and assemble it yourself.  Take the pinion off and do the detect then reassemble.  This is your build.  Own it.  Everything is hard till you do it once then its easier.  After a while its second nature.

Agreed. The most professional look would be grommets but that's assuming you have access to the bare wire at some point to actually slip through it before you solder the connectors on. It is quite a pain though and not worth it in my opinion.

It works also with bigger holes, just important that the back site of covered with tape.
For me Neopren tape worked best as the hole closes after you stick the cable through.
So no way that the silicon get pushed out on the back when you fill the holes up.

It sounds like you need to configure the min/max settings on your hall sensor. You might have to go tinker with your software code to get it right.

Here's a link to a potential problem in the remote's thread. I haven't completed my remote, so I can't give you much more than that as I'm not 100% positive myself.

I would edit my post but I'm not sure you'd get a notification. I was tinkering around with my remote, since I do have that completed. You can edit your min/max and center on the settings. Try messing around with that and see if that fixes anything. In the link I posted above, solidgeek mentions the range of those numbers. Hopefully this should solve your problem.

Good eye :) It is @Idea enclosure. Took about 2 hours of staring at the deck + enclosure and walking through it in my head and then 4 hours of actually drilling, aligning. Even then, couple of holes were misaligned and I had to make the enclosure holes a little bigger. The trampa deck is quite nice to drill. You get nice chunky bits of the composite material coming out. Quite happy with the results.

Now on to the scariest part, the battery. haha

Im sure its a simple explanation, but why do the torque values go down in the esk8 calculator when series count of cells is increased?

10s: ![image|542x500](upload://4e9nQTpLB5tsgNfgtfkSwELAptH.png)  


12s: ![image|562x500](upload://xc188VI8EcYjO15tifDip8jXBJb.png)  

I was under the impression that the builds only got 'punchier'( wouldnt this mean more torque) as the series number increased, as well as other benefits :thinking:

_____________________________
also can I please have everyones opinions on using 6374 170kv motors with a 1:3 gear drive, and 160mm pneumies? Would you think there would be enough torque? I plan to limit the top speed via the Unity, as I don't really want to go faster than 30mph


Should I stick with 10s or 12s?

Guys on a 10s BMS, B1+ wire goes to the positive pack nearest the total battery negative? or the total battery positive?

should it read 3.6v on the multimeter or 36v?

B1+ wire goes to the positive pack nearest the total battery negative?
[/quote]

Yes, a battery always starts with the negative side, so B1+ is the positive pole of parallel pack #1 and so on. B10+ is pack #10 and the same as your positive pole of your whole battery pack. 

When you finished wiring measure the voltages first. Mulltimeter negative on battery negative and with the positive start at B1+, then B2+, B3+...... If the voltage is rising in cell voltage steps (e.g. 3.6V) then you are golden.

Always connect negative pole of your battery to B- of the BMS **before** you plug in the balance cables!

no dump questions!

80A bms is usually good for dual drive if it is a usual street board.
just limit your vesc/focbox to bat max value to 40A per unit and you good to go.

Really?  If you try to lift off a magnet that is still attached it will break.  It will shatter.  They are very brittle.  
If its a bit loose then try a very liquid mix of 2 part high temp epoxy and re set the magnet.  Don't try to remove it.  It will most likely break.

@briman05 that is untrue. Loopkeys are used in lieu of an antispark switch. As told to me by Jeff in the unity official thread. You would have to bypass the unity switch just to use the loopkey as the actual switch. I'm no master but this is how a master described it to me.

Fishpaper protects against vibrations because lots of things like tape and foam wear through under vibration and things will short out.  Fishpaper is better at dealing with vibrations and keeping things insulated.  145ptags.com is a great place to find it

Realistically speaking that battery is far too small for a mountainboard.  With no idea what cells you have then you would have to err on the side of caution when setting battery max and at 2p the power will be very underwhelming.  If you have run the vesc at factory settings right out of the box then the bms is probably cutting the board off when you put it under pressure.  If it is set up charge only then the battery is just sagging.  My advice would be to upgrade the battery to decent 30q cells at a minimum of 4p
I don't feel comfortable advising you on settings for a pack I know nothing about so sorry I can't be more help.  Good luck.

Absolutely yes.  At the moment all you can set your vesc to is 9 amps battery and that will be pretty underwhelming.  With the 30q at 4p you can go up to 80 amps.  The amp rating is 15a but can do 20 safely.

Man I took that chance and regret it. I got a samsung 30q lithium pack from aliexpress and it arrived with one cell dead. Seller and aliexpress tried to make me pay $150 to ship it back for a return. My credit card company saved me and made the guy send another. It worked for about 3 months with decent performance before another cell died. **If you don't have time/money to do it right, you better have time/money to do it again.**

Please please stick with the 30q.  Its the best bang for buck right now and you will regret going to a 25r.
The battery is the heart of your board and as such should be the place where you don't try to save money.
I have both 25r packs and 30q and there is no comparison.

To get a comparable pack using 25r you have to go with more cells so bit of a false economy.  They also sag a lot more.  A lot more.  I have 2 packs at 10s4p one uses 25 and one 30q  As I said there really is no comparison.

I would like to build my first DIY electric mountain board.

I have the board and I have read hundreds of post to select the best and cheapest dyi.
I would like to spent around 350€
I think i am going to a single motor, buy a 12s2p lipo batterie 8000mah ( 100€) one SK3 - 6374-192KV ( 85€) and vesc from enertion ( 90€)

I want to know the best way to charge batteries, i am planning to buy 4x 6S4000mah and do 12s with 8000mah
Would you recommend me a charger for that batteries and how can i charge?
I think the best option is to balance the charger for 6s and disconnect the batteries in series and let the parallel so I can charge two and two.
Is that safe for the batteries or is better charge one by one. I don't have the money to buy a Bms Maybe un the future.
Another question i don't know wich motor mount can i use to a mountain board.  Could this one from hobyking work with the sk3 6374 motor and a mountain board trucks?
Any ideas or something that can improve my settings?

Please keep reading until you have reached thousands of posts. Then keep reading some more and realise that what you want doesn’t exist nor will it ever exist. 
You won’t even be able to build a street build for that amount of money.

I’d say if you are starting from scratch you might be able to build a nice single drive street board for a 1000$. Anything less will be cutting corners and not very good. 
This might satisfy you though so if you decide to go for that please do. Just forget about building a mountain board build for 350€. 
The charger and batteries alone will probably already break the bank for you. 

Even a production mountainboard is way over 350€ if you can call a china at (all terrain) board a mountain board to begin with. Which you can’t, because it isn’t. 

As for your questions please keep on reading and you will find the answers you seek without making a single post.

Hi @Andreu! 
As others already stated the 350€ will definitely no be enough to build a emtb.
Also single drive is not the best choice for it.
With this said, you can safe some money get used parts from here.
Which lipos you choose to buy?
The size already sounds good but for 100€ i‘m Afraid that they have a very bad c-rating. If you have a link or name that would be good.
The motor mounts from hk will probably not fit as they made for street trucks and even there they get lose very easy. Better don’t get them. 
Your motor and esc choice is good 👌
About charging, you can get an imax charger 
https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/s/ref=is_s?k=imax+charger
I think also hobbyking sell them for cheap.
But for this you need to take them out of your box and it takes quite a time till your packs charged. 
A charge only bms is only about 25€ so that could be an option too.

Which deck and trucks you plan to use?

Don’t worry as long as we understand what you want to know all is good 😜
Unfortunately it’s not right how you calculate this.
It’s more like 30*4=120 and from this take the half to get the real max current you can draw.
C-rating is not a Standard and you can never be sure what you really can get out of your pack. Theoretically every producer can write what ever c-rating he want.
If you have a bit more money upgrade to the heavy duty packs on hobbyking. They around 60€ for 6s 5Ah and they 60c. 
The board looks good so far 👌

First soldering attempt this is a bit harder than I thought obviously need to be patient but I'm just practicing.

My question is it ok to shrink wrap that? its strong af I cant pull it off I know its ugly but any reason I cant run with that?

I am probably going to redo it but I just want to know people thoughts on why or why it's not ok.

Much of soldering is all about attention to a detail.  That detail is the meniscus -- the place where the surface of a liquid meets a solid and it bends -- you can usually tell just from that whether it is a good solder joint or not.

ALWAYS, ALWAYS try to pull the wire off with your hand after it cools.  If you can yank it off, then it was no good anyway and it's going to fail.  (If you yank yank it off that does not mean it's okay though)

Good or bad idea to get a "good" tip to use on a cheap iron?

i've busted two tips already but i read its the iron because its not regulating its temps, the tips came with it so assume they are cheap aswell. 'but i am wondering if getting a better tip is going to help or the crappy iron will just wreck that anyway

still using the tips though they are just chipped etc.

I'm new to the VESC side of things and I'm having trouble getting mine to connect to my computer. Let me start from the beginning, gear first.

Here's what I've got, all purchased from Mike & Mark @ Mboards
- One 10s5p battery
- Two 6354 180Kv 2000w motor's (no longer sold)
- [One Flipsky Dual FSESC based on VESC](https://www.mboards.co/products/dual-fsesc-4-20-based-on-vesc%C2%AE)
- One power switch]
- One remote control

I've got a regular Windows 10 computer, I've downloaded the software for the VESC tool from here: https://vesc-project.com/vesc_tool

I'm using the USB cable that came with the VESC and it is connected to the battery, and powered on. Upon startup, I have a blue light for a few seconds (solid) by itself, and then a green LED comes on and stays solid. No other blinks or any other light indicators unless I turn on my remote control. Rocking back on the remote triggers the green LED to more than double in brightness and is clearly linked to controller input. 

When connecting the USB to the computer, and subsequently to the VESC, the computer fails to recognize any connected hardware. No sounds, no changes in connected devices. I've run updates and made sure all USB drivers are up to date.

Inside the VESC tool, specifically the "Connections" window, changing from Com 1 to Com 3 yields no results. I would occasionally get this popup message from the program trying to press the "Connect" button:

"Could not read firmware version. Make sure that selected port really belongs to the VESC"  

Unless I'm crazy, the firmware can't be updated unless it can connect to the computer. And the firmware that should be on the VESC is whatever it came with. 

Can someone please help me get to the bottom of this? My board has been down for more than 3 months now and I desperately want to get it back up and running again. :cry:

Try a other cable. If it’s a charge only cable it will not work. As min this could be a reason.

Also post a screenshot from your main page with motor max/min settings and let us know which cells used in your 10s5p in case you not sure if you set everything right.
The Flipsky 4.20 has some values you shouldn’t exceed. If you do you will get cut outs etc. @ADrum707

I'm not sure what cells they used @ MBoards, but it's a 10s5P battery with 50 cells, 10amp hours, 42 volts. 

I'm trying to figure out how to set my particular VESC to work both motors with the same remote controller, and if I need to cut my motor values in half since I'm using 2 motors.

As of right now, I'm calculating (mostly guessing) that: 

I want to use an FOC configuration, maybe? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

The **_motor max_** should probably be set via the equation A=w/v so for me: 2000W(per motor) / 42 volts (battery rating) = 47.6190 Amps, so set my max to 40 amps? 

I have no idea what I should set the **_motor min_** for, I've heard I need to test that. I live in a particularly hilly/steep grade area in the foothills of the blue ridge mountains, so more powerful braking is preferred. 

For the _**battery max**_, I've calculated (more guessing) that with a 10 amp hour battery, and 50 cells, that gives me 500 continuous amps of power. Divided by the two motors, gives me 250 amps to work with? Maybe? 

For the _**battery min**_  I've heard you should calculate based on your battery S number, multiplied by 2 cells, so as to not damage the battery being re-charged by the braking. No clue on this either. 

Moving on to the _**battery cutoff voltage values**_ I've read that setting these as a minimum of 3.6v * 10S gives me the start, and 3.5v * 10s gives me the end? 

Lets start here and see what I can learn from you masters of the VESC :)

The Flipsky 4.20 dual is a bit special...
Here is a good thread to read through 
https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/flipsky-dual-fsesc4-20-info-review/71079?u=andy87
It also gives you some values you can max set for the controller.

You can use CAN connection (small switch on your esc) so that both sides communicate with each other. One you set up as master one at slave. Your receiver you need to connect to the master and with it you can control both motors.

You battery cut off is good. As you use LiIon you can even set it more low. Like 3.3V and 3V but nothing wrong with the values you choose before.

It will but the range will be better with 5p.  Mtb use large diameter pneumatics and they affect range far more than urethane wheels.  Also the set up is usually heavier so the higher the p rating the better.

What @dareno 👆 said, plus not to forget you will definitely draw more current if you go for a off-road session instead of driving on streets.
If you plan to get a kaly style board than 4p is enough. Everything above I wouldn’t go under 5p

Amps aren't something that are pushed, they are pulled.  Voltage is pushed.

So it outputs 5V, and is capable of supplying a lot of amperage, if drawn.  But with no load the amperage will be zero, while the voltage will still be 5.

Amperes are "A",  "a" means "atto" and is a metric prefix.

What do you need the 3V 300mA for?  It's always possible to use a few diode drops to use the 5V supply for that, but it depends what you need it for.

Sometimes it is and sometimes it doesn't have to be.  Some BMS don't have B0, in that case you must use B-.  Also if you discharge through the BMS you must run large gauge wire to B-.  It all depends.  That's the way I like to wire it with a BMS that has B0

Also that way all your charge current is going through B0 so make sure it's 22AWG or bigger for 4A charge and 24AWG or bigger for 2A charge.

Also always put a 5A or 7.5A or 10A fuse on the charge jack

 No, but I put everything on the negative side for consistency.  That way ALL positives just connect together.  It will work on either side.

The loop key should be female and the side on the board male.

Also you need a [fuse](https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/576-099707.5WXN) on the charge port negative

The charge port positive needs to go to the other side of the loopkey

Also it's better to make the battery in the other configuration

Using a Vruzend kit, so unfortunately the former way seems to be the only option. I'm not sure what you mean by the charge port positive going on the other side. You mean it would go in between the battery and the first XT90 Loop, skipping the loop key?

And for the loop key, just swapping the female and male should fix it?

Leave it @ what its @ right now. Maybe set your cutoffs a volt higher for saftey, but go riding. Running the pack down a little. A few volts worth. Charge it again and see what happens.

So all packs are balanced the same? Go ride it! Run em down. Come back and check your groups. If they're balanced, cool. If not, you have internal problems. 

So for this instance we're going to say that your pack is still balanced after riding. Plug in the charger that wouldn't balance completely. If it throws that pack lower, plug the other charger in. If that charger balances them out, then you know its that charger that's messed up.

No. They are still the same. Before hitting around 4.15-4.2V everything was good.

I just tried to discharge my battery a bit and I plugged in the old charger. It already shows green, but I will let it sit for some time.

Most of the packs are now at 4.21V again and B1 is still at 4.17V. Might actually make a difference if the charger is still turned on when balancing

My old charger outputs 42.4-5 volts with no load and my new one outputs 42V with no load. Could that have caused the problem?

Your bms just balance when reached 4.2v.
What could be, that with your fast charger the bms has less time to balance before the brick Charger switches off.
If you let your cells sit for a while they should go down in voltage anyhow.
Let the charger connected after it turns green.
If it’s green it means that the current from your brick charger is zero. So no need to worry about that.

I'll try to do that! That's also what I had in mind, but it seems like it's taking wayyyy to long without anything happening.

I hope that is the problem because I really don't want to build a whole new batttery pack or take it apart after 2nd charge...

edit: So I just checked all my groups again and now all of them are at 4.2V unless B1. B1 is now at 4.15V :joy:
I seriously don't know whats happening but I think it might actually be balancing now.

Okay so after a long time B1 is now at 4.17V again. Most of the other groups are at 4.22V and a few at 4.21V.

It seems like you are right about that it just needs time to balance, but we'll see. I unfortunatly don't have anymore time to keep the charger on, so I will have to turn it off and plug it back in tomorrow.

yeah, I did produce them way back in the past. There was even some group buy but we didn't make the actual quantity to have them cheap and I don't have enough money to stock them at home.

keep in mind that these are milled out of solid block of aluminium, so you won't be able to reduce the cost to something cheaper.

I am looking to build my very first eboard (I own a few production boards but I want to build my own).  Before I even get to talking about the specs I want, where do you suggest buying parts? Can one ESC be paired with 4 motors? How do you know if your parts are compatible? How would you set up an outrunner motor system? (all of my boards have been hub systems and I personally prefer belt drive).  What kind of remote do you recommend? I am honestly completely new to the world of building these and would love any help you offer.

Welcome to the forum my friend.
The amount of information you are requesting here is far too much for anyone to answer and you would have little to no understanding of it to be honest at this time. 
You need to read and read and then read some more.   
https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/start-here-faq-for-diy-electric-skateboard-builders/215/26

Start with this and then go through some of the build threads.  Get familiar with what you want to build first then put something together in a thread once you have done your research.

Good luck.

Lots of sellers on this site. Read around and see which direction you want to go 

No. Best you can do currently is 2 motors with one controller. Read up on esc vs vesc. You want a vesc based controller. 

You do research to make sure parts are compatible. Not all things are plug and play. That's half the fun. 

Look at @Idea's motor mount systems. They are complete kits and list compatibility with different trucks.

Lots of good remotes out there (Nano x, hoyt Puck, feather, etc) do some research. They all come with receivers you can attach to your controller.

Please do lots of research. There is so much knowledge here it can be overwhelming but that search bar is a godsend.

one esc can not control 4 motors.  It is one esc per motor technically with the new dual esc/vesc you can use 2 for for motors but it still is 1 motor per vesc.

Can you run 2 VESCs on one board paired to the same controller? If this is impractical, what is the best way to make a board 4 wheel drive?
[/quote]

Yes, you can run 4 paired to the same controller if you get the right controller.  I know the Mini Remote supports multiple receivers.  I don't know about other ones.  A lot don't.

I highly recommend vendors here like @psychotiller  but if you want, [banggood](https://www.banggood.com/2_4GHz-Radio-Remote-Controller-Receiver-Transmitter-For-Electric-Skateboard-p-1125575.html?ID=514178&cur_warehouse=CN) has it.  It's not really any cheaper though, and you don't get the service you'd get from a local vendor.  And you wait forever for shipping.  And, if there's a problem...

Only way I recommend that is if you need more than one receiver, and even then still you can just get [extra receivers from eBay](https://www.ebay.com/itm/Redcat-Racing-E710-2-4Ghz-Receiver-with-Bind-Plug-E710/232912167198?ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT&_trksid=p2057872.m2749.l2649).

@Andy87 @J0ker3366

So after having the charger turned on for an hour while it shows green the voltages of each group is now with the charger plugged in:
B1: 4.17V
B2: 4.22V
B3: 4.21V
B4: 4.22V
B5: 4.22V
B6: 4.22V
B7: 4.22V
B8: 4.22V
B9: 4.22V
B10:  4.22V

There is a 0.05V difference does that mean my pack is out of balance?

After pluggin the charger off and letting it sit for a while the voltages are still the same.

I will take the board out for a ride and drain the battery to around 34V. When I come home I will plug in my old charger and charge it up.

Guys, when you measure individual parallel pack voltages, do yo keep the multimeter negative probe on the total battery negative at all times and go from 1-10 on the positive probe side and do the math afterwards?

The problem with my multimeter is that once I get into double digit voltage by parallle pack 3, I have to switch it to a mode where accuracy is only 1 decimal place.

Can I use both the positive and negative probes of the multimeter on each individual parallel pack?

I'm assuming you mean once you get over 10v you switch to 100v setting?

If so, you can still use the 10v setting and measure higher voltages (within reason). It won't damage your meter. It's more for decimal precision

Would it be possible (or advisable) to run two li-ion batteries with the same amount of S and P groups in a parallel configuration as in the image? The though is, that when you know you're going to go an a long ride, to plug in the second battery and secure it on top of the deck (like most mountain boards do). I do have enough knowledge to know that plugging them together when there is an imbalance of charges will cause bad things to happen.

ERPM is electronic Revolutions per minute. It deals with your motors spinning. Basically if you have a 10s you will want around a 190 kv as a 270 kv erpm will be to high for the vesc to handle with the 10s for the battery. There is a thread about selecting the right motor kv.

With you're configuration the ERPM would be 13 (batteries in series) * 4.2 (Volts of fully charged battery) * 190 (kv of motor) * 7 (likely number of poles in motor) = 72618. A good rule of thumb is to be under 60,000.

You have used the calc for this knowledge I'm guessing?  12s with 190 kv will get you to 40+ mph with the correct gearing.  When you input the information into the calc it gives you the nominal voltage and not the full charge voltage.  A 12s battery at full charge is 50.4 v not 42v and this will get you over 40 with 15/36 gearing dropping off over the discharge cycle.

The more cells in parallel the more current you can draw out of your pack and yes with the same serial count you also get more range with more parallel cells.

@Andy87 @J0ker3366

So after discharging my battery to 38.5V the parralel groups are now at:

B1: 3.85V
B2-10: 3.86V 

It seems like it was just a balance issue and (hopefully) not a dead cell :sweat_smile:

The question is now: Should I charge my battery with my old charger or new one?

If I decide to use my old charger, can I see if it was because my new charger is charging a bit too fast the packs didn't get balanced.
If I decide to use my new charger, can I see if it will do the same thing again or what actually happend.

I prefer to using the old charger, only issue is that it will take about 8 hours to charge....

Any suggestions?

edit:
Plugged my old 2A charger in and now it's charging. B1 immediately reached 3.86V

I would continue charging with your new charger and monitor the individual pack voltage for the next charge cycles. If it will repeat to get slightly out of balance try it with your old charger. If it still get out of balance than there is something wrong

Don’t overthink that. All cells have minimal different internal resistance. Your bms doesn’t balance now. Only after reached the balance limit which is like 4.2ish volt per cell.
That’s totally normal that not all packs charge up 100% the same.

So after charging my board with my old 2A charger all parralel groups are now at 4.11V :partying_face:

It seems like the problem is caused by the charger.

4A on a 4p pack is definitely not too much.
Sure slow charge is good but this cells are made for regular slow charge of 1.5A. That would be 6A easy peasy on a 4p pack.

@Andy87 @J0ker3366 @briman05

So after letting my pack charge fully it finally reached 42V. The weird thing is, that now B1 is at 4.17V again while B2-B10 is at 4.20V. The pack charged completely fine and balance but not at the end.

Don't know how it should be possible but it might be a BMS issue that the BMS thinks B1 is at 4.2V but it's not really.

So it's probably not a charger issue.

It could be:
- BMS issue
- Cell issue (dead cell etc)

edit:
It could be fixed by setting the EOC to 41.5V (4.15V per cell) for both longer life span and the same voltage in each cell.

Yes, checked all cells at the beginning. There was a max difference of 0.02-3V. Every cell was at about 3.44V and a few was at 3.43V and 3.45V. It could also be that.

Let's say it's because of that.
I will probably never drain my battery below 33.5V so does it even matter? I mean as long as all of the cells are healthy.

@Andy87 @J0ker3366

After leaving my battery for the night with only the BMS connected my current voltages are now.

B1: 4.15V
B2-B10: 4.19V

That seems a bit strange.

I found another guy on the forum with almost the same issue. Only difference was that his B1 was higher voltage than the rest. I think the problem for him was his cheap eBay BMS.

I'm using a Bestech D140 so it seems a bit weird that the BMS is the issue.

Any suggestions?

Hey, can I use different bearings on some of the wheels on my board ?
I've tested my brand new Super Red ones. One of them is basically dead, not rolling at all and having a big resistance even after cleaning oiling, WD40'ing 
Other seem to have different degree of roll. 
Having noticed that I was wondering if, instead of purchasing a complete new set I could use some spare bearings that I own to use instead of the defective one and if so, do I need a complete wheel with the same bearings or can I use 2 different bearings on the same wheel ?

I've been longboarding as a hobby and mode of transportation for 7 years now but I've never dug deep into the inner workings of this ^^

You can use any bearing to be honest.  You don't have to match them.  They will just wear differently but they tend to do that anyway because they are all subject to differing levels of torment.
Never ever use wd40 unless you are going to re-pack them with grease afterwards

Out of curiosity, does anyone know the most legal way to transfer a 25 lb Electric Skateboard with a 12s4p battery (over 500Wh) throughout the United States? 

According to my research, [UPS page 9 (figure 8)](https://www.ups.com/assets/resources/media/en_US/pack_ship_batteries.pdf) says it might require some "UPS Dangerous Goods contract", but it is a bit confusing. I technically have a battery bigger than 300Wh (total), but technically the cells (each individual 18650 30Q cell) is less than 60Wh.

Ehem... Asking for a friend...

Thanks!

EDIT: Additional research has lead to: https://pe.usps.com/text/pub52/pub52apxc_032.htm which indicates 8 cells or less. So sounds like USPS is out of the options.

How do battery builders typically handle something like this? Or battery resellers? Surely not *everyone* is certified to transfer these types of chemicals... (right?)

Don't get those pulleys, they are 3M.  You want HTD-5M and if it doesn't say that, then it's probably not good

Those teeth are too small and it's also not compatible with anything else in the market so if your belt skips, you have to replace everything instead of one thing.  Also the small teeth skip easier.

That's a good mount and remote

That motor isn't sensored which means you will have to kick-push once before you hit the throttle.  But folks say they're good motors.  I never had one because they aren't sensored.

Gear ratio depends on what top-speed you want (aim for 47km/h / 29mph is my recommendation), what wheel size you want, how powerful your motors are, your motor kv, your battery voltage, and your battery chemistry.

Try the [3D Servisas calculator](https://calc.3dservisas.eu/)

If you get aggressive with your top speed, you won't have much power or strong brakes.

Does this wiring make sense? The battery has the BMS and charge port set up already, just when it comes to the loopkey and vesc does it look fine?

@Andy87 @J0ker3366

So I have been charging my board over the past 3/4 days (might be 5 or something crazy) from when I came home to when I went to bed (at least 24 hours in total) and all of my cells are now at 4.2V! FINALLLLYYYYYYY!!!!!

B1 is at 4.2V and B2-B10 is at about 4.21V-22V and even one 4.23V. The cells with more than 4.2V will eventually fall down to about 4.2V and my whole pack will be balanced.

But now the question is; should I assume that the problem was cause by my new 4A charger and keep using my old one **or** should I use my new charger while monitoring the cells to see if everything is good now?

After seeing that quite a few people on the forum is using the same branded charger as I do, I feel like using my new one is a good idea but I either don't want to spend 5 days again balancing my battery.

I just changed my mind while writing this post:

I will be using my old charger for some time while monitoring the cells and after 4-5 charges, will I change to my new one and monitor the cells.

10AWG: 55A continuous, ~110A peak &lt; 10s   
8AWG: 73A continuous, ~150A peak &lt; 10s
6AWG: 101A continuous, ~200A peak &lt; 10s

And for charging and balance leads etc

26AWG: 2.2A continuous
24AWG: 3.5A continuous
22AWG: 7A continuous &lt;-- usually this one
20AWG: 11A continuous
18AWG: 16A continuous
16AWG: 22A continuous

Hello ! 

What do reducing amps coming out of the battery do ? Less torque ? 

I’m thinking about buying a Sanyo 10S 8.1Ah from meepo or ownboard but they can provide only 30 amps, i’m right now with an 8S 4.5Ah and I wanted to get a higher top speed and to go further so this battery should do the job depending on what reducing amps will do.

Thank you !

Yup that’s cool, and 8.1Ah will give me a way higher range too.

It’s on the choices for the meepo or ownboard boards, here you go : https://www.ownboard.net/collections/parts-accessories-for-electric-skateboard/products/ownboard-electric-skateboard-battery?variant=12207818801194

What is interesting for me rn is that it’s « Plug and play », bms included and it already fit my enclosure that I bought from there too.

Max on the website is rated up to 24A but lots of guys here suck up to 32Amps from it.

I just wanted to know what will really happen if I change from my 45C 4.5Ah (So I can sent directly 50Amps easily to my Vesc) to this battery excepting higher speed and range.

@Alex753 
Just be a bit careful then when setting the battery amps on the vesc because that battery is mated to the chinese esc which can only do 36 amps.  While the battery can probably actually do more like 50 the bms can not.  Its a rated unit and I blew one at 25 amps per vesc so 50 total.  

@tardyparty7

I shouldn't think so as the evolve stuff uses a step down axle from 10mm to 8mm and the pulley set will have a 10mm bearing.  They are also quite a long unit when together so a standard caliber would need some hanger removed and the pulley would need a bearing swap.  Pain in the arse.  Might fit on a tb 218 with a bearing swap though.  Begs the question why though as there are loads of much simpler options available and you know that.

So the extra voltage makes up for the slightly less current.  You could run that battery at 40 amps though.
Do the math to calculate watts and see the difference in output.  If there is one  :wink:
watts = volts x amps

No, you want the loop key to be both XT90S (not XT90) and you want the key to be the female part.

@Andy87 @J0ker3366

Unfortunately the other parallel packs didn't fall down to 4.2V like I expected. Seems like it was the 0.02V difference when i built the pack that have caused the problem. I will probably have to connect a small lamp to each of the cells with higher voltage to discharge every cell manually down to 4.2V.

I am most likely just gonna ride the board for now and see if it turns out to be a big issue. If not, then I'll discharge them manually when I feel like. And who knows, it might fix it self.

But thanks for all of the help guys! You seriously don't know how much it helps and I really appreciate it more than you think and it sounds like!

Protip: @buildityourself also plug the two halves together when you solder to them.  Being plugged-in keeps the pins straight while they get hot enough to melt nylon 

So that means you need an extra pair above and beyond the ones that will go in your build.  Also the extra pair is insurance if you mess one up, you can use the messed-up one as your holder.  Kind of [like this messed up one](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/how-to-anti-spark-xt-90-loop-key/204/104?u=b264) I accidentally built wrong, so now I just use it to hold ones that I am soldering on to keep the pins straight.

Depends if you want to drive 1 motor or 2 motors. 

1 motor:
internal series connections: 10AWG or dual 14AWG
external wiring: 12AWG

2 motors:
internal series connections: dual 12AWG
external wiring: 10AWG


This is just a rough idea and depends on lots of different things

The battery lasts so long it's ridiculous.  I made that over a year ago and use it all the time.  I've charged it a grand total of one time, aside from the initial charge when I made it.

If I did it again, I'd say you can use a much smaller cell :smiley:

500mAh is ***plenty***, like way more than enough

That cell is a 2600mAh 18500.

The one I have listed in the free things thread is an 1100mAh 14650 and even that is way overkill.

Bottoming our is where the bottom of the board would scrape the ground or whatever you are going over. You could always mount the battery in a box on top of the board. I wouldn’t use PLA I would use ABS.

If I jump my deck flex that much that the under site of the deck touch/hit the ground.

Based on my primary tests I'd estimate that car driving over my deck wouldn't cause damage to the cells inside...
If 90kg me doesn't even bend holder for 4 cells, then it would probably need like 200kg to get it to collapse, but you also have more of these and I could add additional center spine which along with housing for 10 cells would be able to withstand 400kg...

So first get a pair of needle nose pliers and insert them into the C adapter’s like this

![e801542a2f736b4cca30dd5b263db3fcc57dc094_1_375x500|375x500](upload://m5kANAwx7SJODhIWK68gh1XPLBe.jpeg) 

Then twist them so it’s like this, this should now fit on the truck. If it doesn’t then just shove the pliers further down at the first step

![4a400ea8c81f7de16739c62994d4be597c181aaa_1_375x500|375x500](upload://qGYVFmUZDjAYcoJvS2vd7PtrcGI.jpeg) 

On the clamp, the screw has two sides it can go into, you want to insert the screw into the threaded side first

![edab133aaefd888b1b6b7854bc3acb3a61e82073_1_375x500|375x500](upload://b4RXjOKIN8PbO3ChIiZdLsm9LlH.jpeg) 

Like this

Then when your near filling the gap get a piece of strong metal (I use the metal ring thing from the front of my dicky pulley) then tighten the screw until it bends the metal out

![168f94b557b919aae556ccd7235f261fc37d7476_1_375x500|375x500](upload://h2IKl5MVe6Zhf79JGXp03qWz1AK.jpeg) 

Then just put it in the truck and remove the screw and you’re all good, just when using that extra piece of metal make sure it isn’t obstructing the part where the truck goes into


This is my method for getting these mounts on. Its yet to fail me

If I did the calculations correct and looked at the right meepo battery the meepo battery comes out to be 291.6 wh which is more than the boosted. The meepo is a 10s battery.

If you have a focbox of the latest hw version or a Flipsky esc 6 or dual 6 than you will not have any issues with the CAN.
In general there is nothing bad in CAN as long as you fix the plugs with a drop of hot glue or solder the two wires directly to the pins. Use a parallel plug for the power supply and you good to go.

I have an ollin vesc that won’t work sensored. 
It works fine sensorless. 
I tried the motor on a different ollin vesc and it works fine sensored so I’m assuming the problem is with the vesc. 

My google-fu is apparently weak because I can’t seem to find the right search terms to get relevant results. 
I’m trying to understand what has failed and what leads to this type of failure. Up until now I haven’t really encountered any sensor issues so I’m just looking to learn a bit as I seem to be out of my depth. 

This issue may very well be beyond my ability to repair and I will send to drvwizard if I need. 

Disclaimer: I bought these used with the full understanding that they may have issues and I am quite happy with them.

On bldc: 
Motor detection works fine, motors spin. 
In sensorless, everything works fine When applying power after detection. 
In sensored, motor won’t spin it just shudders. when applying power after detection. 

On foc: 
Motor detection works fine up until detect hall sensors. During detect hall sensor motor spins slowly both directions but it errors with bad detection. 
In sensorless it works fine. 

Hope I’m saying all that clearly. 
Thank you

Sounds like a bad detection which is not necessarily hall sensor related.  Try upping it a bit more and see what occurs.  I run one of mine at .20 before it will detect.  HK SK8.

honestly there are tons of prroduction boarrds that MAY or may not suite your needs. However if you want something to last and not blow up, your best bet is to talk to some of the builders on this forum. I went the @psychotiller way because his quality and services are top notch. With that, there are many builders on this forum. Try reaching out like i did. And hopefully you dont have to make the same mistakes alot of us have made buying production. happy hunting frriend.:beers:

Note to mention:  Building part by part can often save you money in the long run, but more than likely will cost you more upfront. But again... The quality most builders offer is "NIGHT AND DAY" over the mass production stuff.

Once you have the kit then build it and then watch the tutorial and read everything you can find here and watch everything you can on youtube.  That way you learn how to do it for yourself and not just repeat what you have been told.  This way you can affect repairs and changes all on your own.  Good choice though and good luck.

Check the voltage of each cell on the balance plug (If your charger doesn't have a measuring option), most likely one of the cells is deep discharged to the point where the charger says it's unsafe to charge the battery.
You may be able to charge the deep discharged cell (slowly) up again, right to the point where the charger accepts to balance charge the whole battery. Other option would be to disassemble the the battery removing the bad cell and to reuse the left ones but nothing for LiPo noobs basicly.

BTW does the LiPo look puffed or anything?

Well If you can determine that one of the cells in the battery is puffed up than this specific cell in the pack is basicly dead and/or unsafe to use. If the pack overall is only very slightly puffed and even more recovering over time you can use it but keep an eye on it (don't drain to much amps from it and do not use it when it's swelling again).

Either way you should check the voltage on each single cell in the battery pack (over the balance leads) and share them with us, if the whole battery is over discharged it's most likely not reuseable for esk8 (or any other high loads) and may need to go to your local recycling center.

@Mudders the 6mm / 0.25" tinned braided copper is good for 40A continuous.  And for wire,

For wiring vesc batteries etc.

14AWG: 32A continuous, ~65A peak &lt; 10s
12AWG: 41A continuous, ~80A peak &lt; 10s
10AWG: 55A continuous, ~110A peak &lt; 10s
8AWG: 73A continuous, ~150A peak &lt; 10s
6AWG: 101A continuous, ~200A peak &lt; 10s

And for charging and balance leads etc

26AWG: 2.2A continuous
24AWG: 3.5A continuous
22AWG: 7A continuous &lt;-- usually this one
20AWG: 11A continuous
18AWG: 16A continuous
16AWG: 22A continuous

All cables should be silicone insulated and super/fine stranded.

So for a single motor battery rated at 40A max, you can use one braid and 12AWG wire

For a dual motor battery rated at 55A continuous you can use dual 6mm braid and single 10AWG (or dual 14AWG) wire

Of course, it also matter what cells you use and what nickel...

Thanks very much, I think I'm on the right track, I'm using 2 maytech 6374, 12s 6p 30q, charge only bms and unity.
I have purchased the silicon wire in 10awg, 12awg and 22awg, I'm using nkon .15x10mm nickel strip (not sure if I need to double layer this up?)

I'll get the tinned braiding and as soon as the spotwelder arrives make some sparks!

It depends what you want.  I don't think 65A continuous will be a problem for you.  That's 3250W.  It all depends what you want.  Also the less you stress your cells, the longer they last so if anything is over-rated, you want it to be the cells above all else.

Sure @b264 has his own response but to give you an idea of insane settings.  If your battery max discharge is 60A probably set the battery max amperage in VESC to be something lower than this (like 40A) same for charging, don't push more than a few C at max for regen braking so as to not damage cells by pumping too much charge into them too quickly.  Make sure the voltage settings for the battery make sense in terms of max and soft/hard cut off values (minimums).  You could also limit eRPM but if you have a low enough kv*voltage (below 8,571 RPM assuming 14 pole motor or in any case under 60,000 eRPM), then it won't be an issue.

---

Also assumed you do motor calibration with no load on the motor and receiver setup so you can control your motor.

Yes, this.

[quote="wafflejock, post:3524, topic:9559"]

[/quote]
3600C = Hz = 1 per second

That means if you have a 12Ah battery, for example purposes, don't regen ("battery minimum" setting) less than 1 - 2 C which in this case is -12A to -24A. Going less like -30C might harm your cells.  And I would even stay above -24A.

[quote="wafflejock, post:3524, topic:9559"]

[/quote]

This means like, for example if you have a lithium-ion battery, set cutoffs at 3.2V/cell and 3.4V/cell which for a 10S battery means "cutoff start" is 34.0V and "cutoff end" is 32.0V

If you have lithium-polymer or lithium iron phosphate or lithium titanate, the numbers will be different.

If you don't use a motor over 190kv, this won't be an issue with 10S systems.

Alright on this pcture it shows 5 resistance readings on a battery, each of them regarding a single cell.
But most people use 3x 4S batteries or 2x 6S LiPo batteries (1S in a battery is a cell, 6S are 6 LiPo cells connected in series to one battery), I wonder if the battery is that damged that the charger can't get a reading on every cell in that battery after you shorted the battery (melting the connector) by accident. 
If it's actually a 5S cell and the resistance measurement is correct than they look suprisingly healthy, meaning that probably a loose connection is causing "BATTERY VOL ERR CELL LOW VOL".

PS: You did relace the XT90 plug that melted when you tried to charge it up again right?

@Bjork3n @J_Dizzle   If a key isn't an option, my recommendation would be to use a dremel tool or similar method to put a flat on the motor shaft, and then use a good quality setscrew. Don't use the cheap Chinese ones that are made of cheese, they will strip, and then you will cry. Get some good high-strength (grade 8 if imperial, grade 12.9 if metric) cup-point setscrews from somewhere like McMaster-Carr. They even sell them with threadlocker already applied. 

I do not recommend trying to stuff a setscrew into a keyway, because under significant force (like braking) the keyway has a good chance to deform, and thus become stuck in the pulley, even once you remove the screw. If you have a suitable flat, the setscrew has something to properly bite into, without fear of deforming the shaft and making it impossible to remove at a later date.

Loctite 648 is good, but like b264 said, it's better to have a physical attachment where it really matters most.

Not saying I recommend it, but one thing I noticed is that if you cut the connector off, the wires inside the cable are usually red and black, and red is usually positive.  Of course I don't recommend cutting off the connector to check.  But if you were already cutting it off and don't have a multimeter, it may be useful to know.

It's much, much better to check with a multimeter.

Remember to always put a [fuse](https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/576-099707.5WXN) on your charge port of your esk8 and never stick multimeter probes in there unless it's fused.

Hey guys!  I have a noob question!
I decided to buy an eskate, the problem is I dont know what specs I need!
I coudnt find a review that fits my city.

Where i live is all ups and downs, only hills, I need a skate that doesnt go that much far (10 km is just fine for me) but it need to be able to do like 15-20% climbs without slowing the traffic (I have to go to the roads since we have no bycicle lane), so good brakes and good capacity on going uphills very important!

Also the roads are not perfects! there are lots of holes and disconnected floors..is that a problem?
Should I pick a bigger wheels skate?

So..i need to know:
- how much power i need? (2x400W is enough for 15% climbs?)
- are normal wheels a problem in shitty roads? will i fall?

Thank you!

Ps. I m not a skater! I m a snowboarder, this would be my first time skating..and i didnt want to spend more than 300 euros = 350/400 $

2x400W is technically enough for big hills, but you're going to go ***really*** slow and it won't have much brakes either.  To get strong brakes, you need powerful motors.

If you get the 107mm wheels you will probably be okay.  Around here I have the worst roads you can imagine and I get around fine on them.  You will learn where all the obstacles are as you ride.

Hey guys could you look trough my wiring and check if anything is wired the wrong way. I am getting a negative amperage when i pull the throttle and i have no idea why.

Startibg from vesc rightside of most upper xt90 is plus wired middle xt90  bottom part of plug is plus bottom xt90 rught side is plus wired

Upper xt90 is plus on upper side of the plug
Middle xt90 has posituve on side where there is a label
Lower xt90 has positive on right side

Oh yeah pls dont look  at the wire colours i know they are wrong haha

Hopefully i didnt fry my esc :sweat_smile:

The symbol next to DC output power on the pictured adapter shows if positive is in the center or if negative is at the center it is typical to have positive in the center and negative on the outside.

See the circle on the outside has a negative symbol and circle in the center has a positive symbol, lots of DC adapters with barrel jacks include that symbol.

I got a Emertion Spacecell and need to put on a 10pin Jst for my BMS. 
Enertion has a balance lead with 11 pins (10blance+ground)

Now my question is ![image|375x500](upload://vOqzcyFqVxrPBXz7T1R4ErT8tbR.jpeg)  balance lead is the first and which the last on the enertion connector?
Unfortunately I will only be home in a week where my voltmeter is.. 
Would you just cut the ground from the enertion jst or connect it too the ground from the battery? 

Thanks!

@Ian-mountainboard  I am of the school of thought that the BMS should have full authority, so my setups have always been wired for charge and discharge. Of course, this has the drawbacks that you need a physically large BMS to handle the high current we deal with, and if the BMS decides the battery is in danger or empty, you'll be unable to ride any further. 

On the other side of the fence, if you use a charge-only BMS, it can be physically smaller, and in an emergency you can mistreat the cells a little bit more than you normally would to get home. But if you're habitually inattentive, this can lead to reduced lifespan for your batteries, since the BMS has no way to stop you from doing damage.

@Ian-mountainboard I had almost exactly that BMS in my first build, and it worked fine. (I think the fets were different, but everything else looks the same, right down to the yellow wires.) If you have a little extra room and cash,and are looking for some more functionality, I can also recommend [this BMS](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/Smart-Display-300A-200A-150A-100A-70A-Lithium-Battery-Protection-Board-Balance-BMS-Coulomb-Meter-Lithium/32826820690.html) with bluetooth. The VBMS app (android only iirc) is excellent, and allows you to set all the parameters exactly how you need them. I have the 100A version in my electric bike battery, 20s7p 20AH.

I got one with display, but after looking at it I'm not actually planning to use the display in the final bike design. The app gives all the info the display does, and the UI is better. You can cheat the current limits somewhat with those BMSs and set the current limit higher or lower than 100A. I don't remember exacty what the absolute high side is off the top of my head.

Just use blue loctite on the grub screw.  Don't use red.  And I wouldn't even use blue until you ride it about 100 meters and make sure it's okay.  Don't end up going for a 10km joyride either to test it, bolts and screws will start falling out

Would 12mm belts be enough for a dual 6374 motor setup with 6x2 inch pneumatics?

I am having tolerances way below comfortable between components and I think I'd rather have them a bit more spaced out.. ~2mm mount to pulley, ~2mm between motor shaft nubs on the bells.

This "downgrade" in pulley width would allow me quite a lot of space at least between motors, but I don't know if I'd be snapping belts left right and center.. :smiley:

It doesn't look like it, but I'm not sure.

If I had to fathom a guess on the least-likely-to-not-work way, it'd be the center switch pin is probably "C" and goes in the middle where it says C1 and the other two pins go to the pads next to it.

If you're unsure of how it's wired or how to find out, I would not connect any of the pins to + and to -

$25 BMS will either destroy your cells by letting them go 4.25V or won't handle debalanced cells with their tiny 50mA balancing resistors if it will even have any...

Or preferable just buy something like DieBieMS maybe it's pricey but future proof(up to 12S) so can use with multiple builds.

I went and bought tools to tap them both but totally spaced out on "sealing" the holes before I did it. Is it safe to say that I need to open them up and clean the debris (not sure if any went in them)  or just get new motors and NOT risk it.

50mA balancing

Is slowly but shouldn’t be an issue as long as you don’t buy shitty cheap crap lipo packs.
If you do, than you have sure other problems than balancing.

[quote="Arek, post:3639, topic:9559"]
something like DieBieMS
[/quote]
It’s not a bms?

If you think that overcharging a cell at 0.05V than just let your bms set up to a lower voltage.
Yes that’s possible even with the cheap 25$ one.
Is called factory settings.

Do you know what would be a real argument why you should use a hobby charger instead of a bms?
With the hobby charger you can drain your lipos to storage voltage.

That's just about the only reason that exists, and that can be done by riding it also or connecting a resistor or automotive light bulb on it.

I personally don't like taking my enclosure apart 5 times per day to charge it, 7 days per week, so I want a regular charger and a BMS inside.

How is it working?
By measures voltages properly(if a decent charger) and then simply doesn't overcharge.

If someone is buing cheap BMS he will probably buy some cheap lipo or lion cells.

DieBieMS is a BMS, dude....

Since when $25 BMS can be adjusted?
Can I have a link to one?

More of a argument is that you can get one with 1A balance current for not much.
Also can use it to measure capcity/impedance of each cell adn then assemble the pack properly and have no issues with balancing.

@b264 True, I never said RC charger is a good option at all for esk8s.
Just don't cheap on the BMS too much...

Well that bestech d140 has overcharge protection up to 4.35V, HOW'S THAT EVEN CALLED PROTECTION???
And even no undervoltage protection at all.
It's typical super low budget penny pinching BMS using multiplied 1S protection circuits...

And then HCX-D239 basically the same crap just has balancing resistors and undervoltage protection. 

There were many test showing that 50mV is a lot for lithium batteries, you charge only to 4.15V and triple the battery life, you charge it to 4.25V you get like half of the life.
And then your amazing BMS overcharging by 250mV >.<

Also where's that functionality to change the overvoltage values you mentioned?
HOW??
Those are permamently set in the ICs...

It's one layer of protection, the charger also should not go that high.  Also I want my battery to be able to be overcharged if it means my brakes keep working.  I'd prefer a shorter battery life then streetface in certain circumstances.

Basically it is keeping you clear of "starting a fire" area but not ensuring you use it properly.  It's just a failsafe.

The problem and whole reason we have BMS is that you can't rely on the fact that charger stops at X voltage which should end as 4.2V/cell because you can get all cells at 4.0V and one at 5V in fires and have same correct X voltage

4.35v that's over volt protection, like from a regen system attempting to pump more voltage than it's designed for.

given the right charger it'll never over-volt, right, 12s charger max voltage is 50.4v...so it can't go above that.  now...if someone's being funny and used a 60v cc/cv charger on a 12s or something, yea this bms will stop it at 4.35v, but don't do that.

anyway, in esk8 application does not apply since both upper and lower voltage cutoff is configurable via vesc.

and yes, charging to less than 4.2v yields longer cell life.  i've asked bestech if they can balance charge to 4.1v and was straight up denied.

Thank you for that. Lots of useful stuff there. I think one thing to think about with this topic is that just because a BMS can go up to 4.35V doesn't mean that it always will. Doing this a couple times over ~300 cycles will not significantly degrade performance. BMS protections are the exception, not the norm.

fully agree.  Unity is a wonderful thing on paper but focbox is proved.  No doubt unity will be in time.  
Redundancy is a funny thing.  You go dual because of the power and the fact that if one thing goes wrong you will still have the other side.  What about the fact you are now doubling the chances of something going wrong though?  The more you add the more things you have to fail so the unity by definition should be more reliable than 2 seperate units.

The question is always how long a burst is defined. With this pack you can continues draw 100a. I would do a bit of research what 18650 in general can handle for like 10s and than set this on relation to your 30q pack.
How much you expect to draw as burst?

Your burst is definitely higher, but idk what you understand under burst. That can be 1s, 10s, 1m idk.

As it’s probably not so easy to find information how much you can get as burst out of the 30q cells I wanted to know how much amps you expect as burst....

Hey everybody, i am setting up my motors with the vesc tool. detection works fine, I am running sensored bldc. However when i try to spin up using the remote: the master seems to "lock up" about half of the time and the slave just locks up and won't spin. What am i doing wrong?

hey,
i have a 6s4p li-ion battery with a hobbyking BMS

however the bms broke and i can no longer charge my battery 

wanting to replace it asap(cuz hobbyking doesn't seem to restock it soon)
i was wondering what would happen if i replaced it with this one, would i damage my battery?

I tried them both independent from each other, same issues still happen. I then tried out uncensored which seems to work fine. so I'm guessing its something with the flipsky motors and the sensors not working.

Edit2: i just realized my battery is at 20% and I have set my cutoff at 3.3 volts per cel. maybe that has to do something with it....

Edit, btw anybody who knows how this connector is called? ![15480085942977525070182237588534|375x500](upload://bv9tZrbyXTagxNqGAFwBP2eJesA.jpeg)

Used laptop cells won't work.  They can't supply enough current, and you will kill them trying to pull that much from them.  The only way those will work is if you make something like a 6S20P battery with them.  That will work for an esk8.

At 2P deep, you need to set your "Battery Current Max" to like 5A which won't get you anywhere.  Otherwise your cells will sag so far they will die immediately.

There's no way you're getting 30mph+ from laptop cells.  You might be able to get 20mph if you do it correctly and you have at least 100 of them, and they are all good.

12s2p-???p should give you 30 mph (not that that long though). Think 12s1p would give you too little amps. If you want to get more range then put more cells in parallel. You can use this site to find top speed, range etc. https://calc.3dservisas.eu/

The problem with laptop cells is you need the "P" as high as fucking possible or it's not really going to work.

So 6S20P might get you there but it's 120 cells.  If you went to 10S20P now you're talking about 200 cells.

See the problem?

And if the cells are all random and not matched, it's even worse.

Yes, it's caused by excessive current draw.  Better cells do this less than worse cells.  Newer cells do this less than older cells (>100 discharge cycles).  New and better cells hardly do this at all.

You can use 16 as a 8S2P.

Or 18 as a 6S3P

I'm not sure I would go below that.  Technically, you could even do 7S1P but "Battery Current Max" would need to be 20A (with 30Q cells) and you won't get 25mph+

@paulbriz all batteries are not equal. Listen to @b264, he knows his stuff. Esk8 is an expensive hobby, and the battery is usually the most expensive single part. Do not cheap out on your batteries. If you do, best case is that they don't work. Worst case, they catch fire while you're riding them.

There are hundreds of threads and dozens of tutorials on this site, and you really need to take the time to read this shit. It's the difference between a great ride and having streetace.

Absolutely.  Best bang for your buck in the long run and proven.  Lipo choice can be a lottery as can using unproven liion cells lol
Get yourself some Samsung 30q and read all you can about construction.  When you have read all you can then start over and read it all again.  Good luck my friend

you dont really need 50 if you are just starting of, a 10s4p (40 cells) or 10s3p should already do the trick. especially if you have one motor then 10s3p is more than enough.

Replacing the connector on your battery is extremely dangerous and can cause a structure fire if you don't know exactly what you're doing

Generally you want to do only one wire at a time and completely finish it and insulate it with heatsrink before you cut loose the other wire.

Just make sure one wire goes all the way to "completely done, and insulated" before you touch the other wire at all.

Also if you solder on the XT90 it helps to keep them plugged together so the pins don't bend when they get hot.

If you intend on using the BMS as a charge only, I see no problem with it.
However, the new BMS you linked has the over discharge protection voltage set at 2.9V which will damage a LiPo.
Unless the manufacturer can setup the BMS from LiIon to LiPo then I would stay away from it.
Also keep in mind that the new one has 30A discharge whereas your BMS has 10A.

```
13s is the highest possible voltage a vesc can handle. 12s, being close to that, puts more stress on the vesc than 10s will, and thus people tend to have a somewhat higher failure rate with 12s than with 10s, especially with FOC, and especially with 4.xx hardware. That's what b264 means about fuckup space with 10s vs 12s.

In terms of advantages and disadvantages, assuming you keep all the same hardware (wheel size, pulley size, motor KV, etc) 12s will give you a ~20% higher top speed, but since 10s3p can supply more current and power than 12s2p, you'll get better range and acceleration with 10s. 

Boosted uses entirely different cells. They're a different size (26650 vs 18650) and a different cemestry (LiFePO4 vs NCA). Our batteries are much more energy-dense, but LiFePO4  has a higher cycle life and is safer.

I have to disagree on the acceleration and torque argument. I have found the acceleration to be much punchier at 12s4p versus 10s5p 30q where the gearing and motor Kv remains the same.

It's a judgement call on your part. If you use the 60A one, the BMS has more authority to protect the cells (it will shut off the output if the current is too high or the voltage is too high or low.) This has an upside and a downside - Upside, the batteries will last longer. Downside, if the vesc does something to the batteries the BMS doesn't like, it'll shut off and you'll suddenly have no power and no brakes (this can be avoided somewhat in the vesc settings).

With the low amp BMS, you'll have to bypass the discharge, so the BMS won't be able to stop the vesc from hurting the cells. But on the flip side you won't have to worry about cutouts.

I like using a BMS with full authority, but a lot of people here don't, because they're larger, and more expensive. 

Either way works, as long as you get your vesc all set up right.

The no power no brakes scenario could happen at 2 of the worst case moments for a fall If the bms is not rated high enough.  Full acceleration (bms shutoff leads to superman to faceplant). and heavy braking early in your ride ( leads to death by car or braking using body surface as an ablative compound). 

Either use a high rated bms or bypass it for discharge leaving the vesc to deal with low and high voltage cutouts which will be safer for you... the battery will be safe too if you program the vesc with battery health in mind. 

Just my opinion.

The problem is not fitting them inside.

The problem is after they are under extreme vibration for 500 miles the wires will short out because all their insulation rubbed off and they will start a fire inside the tube, causing neighboring cells to start fires in a chain reaction.

I'm sure that can be mitigated though if you use your craftiness...perhaps filling it with potting epoxy, but then the batteries might get hot.

Seriously you think that working this noob thread is something we do for fun?  No we take from the community so we give back and when a topic that has been thrashed out for 2 days comes back to the same origin it can be slightly annoying.  Next time link the post at the beginning of the enquiry to the inquirer and keep it real.  Otherwise we go round in circles and circles and circles.....

So im all setup on my 2 x escapes 2 receivers no canbus , i just tested what would happen if my remote disconnected/lost signal/power while the board still has power.

Kinda glad i checked because it goes straight to full throttle, what or where are the settings i need to change so it doesnt do this or breaking hard, but just idles instead.

go back to your ppm setting till you see the throttle bar.
than switch off the remote and you will see that the throttle will go in one direction.
adjust that with the trim button/wheel till you are in center position.
after that make the min/max throttle adjustment again.

Ah I misread your question.

Don't confuse "speed" and "power"

You are probably controlling "power" with your remote.  If you want it to control speed, use PID speed control application

On the bench the full speed will be attained with little throttle as it is current that is being controlled not voltage.

To get a true test you have to have you board undersome weight.  What you actually meant by your post is at 30-40% you get 100% of the power.  You should be able to adjust your throttle curve which would be as you pull on the throttle trigger more the faster it ramps up the power going threw the motor. If you fine tune it you should get a nice smooth ramping throttle curve.

Chrome plating sounds like a really, really, really bad idea.

Only thing I've ever seen happen with that is chrome flaking off as it ages and little metal flakes getting in your motor is a recipe for fast failure.

@yelnats8j  For a quick and dirty anodizing setup, it's nearly as simple as chrome plating, and far less toxic than chromium salts.

You need a bath of sulfuric acid, a power supply, and a stainless electrode. To add color, just take your freshly cleaned anodized part, and dunk it in some concentrated dye, then in boiling water to seal it.

Obviously sulfuric acid is nasty, so if you ever do this, be very careful. But the actual process is pretty simple.

@briman05 @angeljmm @Bjork3n @Andy87 @Arek @b264 

Got them out. Used a dremel to cut a spot for a flat screwdriver. Also tried the torx and hammer but didn't fit.

The bolts got stripped after trying to unscrew the bolts without heating the loctite up. I think that you have to heat up the loctite before unscrewing to make sure they don't get stripped.

Thanks a lot for the help guys!

It depends on the loctite that was used if it was the red loctite you do need to heat it as it is considered permanent.  The blue loctite should allow the bolts to move with some pressure.

Little bit of heat is always a good idea with loctite even the blue once its been in there a while.  Not all thread lockers are created equal too.  I have some blue that goes off like red and some red that goes off like blue.  Moral of the story is to use recognised and trusted brands.  Then you know what you're getting.

Another reason your bolts were easily stripped (two, actually) is that you are using button head screws, which have a smaller drive than cap head screws of the same size. Also, they appear to be stainless, which is significantly less strong and softer than alloy steel.

 Another thing you can do to prevent stripping if you haven't already, is get a set of Wera HexPlus allen wrenches. Yes, they're expensive, but they work better than anything else.

Hey guys

Looking for an input on VESC settings.
The board is 10s3p with Focbox and Keda63 motor.

All running great except when going up hills. It begins to decelerate and eventually stop.
If I step off the board it continues without problem.

It doesn't look right because similar setup with "ebay esc" gets me over the same hills.
What setting in the BLDC tool should i look for.

Thanks,
Dani

So I posted about this before, but I'm making a deck, to deck swap my first build, while also building an enclosure for it. I was wondering where I should buy the veneers? Amazon was my go to choice, but it seems expensive. I know many other people here make their own decks, and I came here for advice. 

Don't worry, I used the search function, on google and this forum. I found no good guide for a simple deck press tutorial. I want to use are Maple veneer, but idk whats best, and I **don't** know how many layers! Any advice?

You need to plan your deck out a bit more before you buy anything. How fast are you going to go? What battery size are you planning? How heavy are you? 

All of this goes into how many layers you want. Start with maple, can’t go wrong there. 9-11 plys is a good range. If you are going to do a cut out go higher in plys.

If you are doing a big battery that will stretch the entire bottom side, you want little to no flex there, so more plys

Making a custom deck from scratch doesn't really qualify for the "noob question thread" IMO, you might be a noob to pressing decks but if you are a noob to building at all starting by making your own deck especially if you're trying to save money isn't the way to go.  That said if you're just a noob to pressing decks and want to get in on a conversation about presses or deck materials seems there are more appropriate threads: https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/how-to-build-a-pneumatic-press/77058/11 If not would say just start a new one and leave this thread to be open to more generic/simple/starter questions.

By 'remove', I mean I cut it off, stripped the wires a bit, then soldered on the proper connections with some insulating shrink tubing. Works like a charm! LEDs on the charge brick are red and green to show state of charging.

Should. You should avoid cheaping out on the BMS as well. It's designed to protect the battery, so if it's crap, it's like riding with a $10 helmet. Its not worth saving $10-15 here, only to have the BMS fail and result in the destruction of your $100-150 battery pack later.

If this is the BMS you got

https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/noob-question-thread-ask-your-questions-here/9559/3826?u=taz

unless you are actually using LiFePo4 cells then it is not suitable for your application as it will only charge to 3.65V per cell.

I have that plug on some things and don't really like it, I prefer the 5.5mm*2.1mm barrel plug.

The part on your board is the male because it has 3 pins and the charger side is female because it has 3 holes.

Hi I have a question, why do most bestech bms say that the overvoltage protection voltage is 4.20 - 4.35 volts if 4.35 volts can damage your pack?
I look forward to your response.

## \#3948 Posted by: b264 Posted at: 2019-01-23T13:09:51.184Z Reads: 68

It's only a failsafe.

4.35V will damage your pack.  The BMS has a failsafe to prevent a fire.  Under normal circumstances it should never get to 4.35V and the BMS will never kick that off.  If for some reason you have a catastrophic malfunction, it will shut it off before a fire happens while charging....

Hey, i just got these mounts as well. I can see you're using 305mm length belts. I purchased 320mm and they're too long with 1 idler on each mount. Is 305mm a sweet spot to go with? I didn't think too much about this before i got them i didn't realise you couldn't shift the motors back and forth like with the TB ones.

Edit: also whats your gearing ratio?

I also have an question about the relation between amperage of a battery and amperage of the motor. I always see different amperage set and come out off stats posted. How is that. For instance I have a battery pack of 12S1P that can deliver a Amperage of 100A continuous (LIPO`s). I have 2 TB vesc`s  so i max the wattage of the battery at 45A continuous so I wont overload them. I do that because the amperage outputted by the battery goes straight through the VESC thats rated at 50A continuous right? I am not sure at this point hahah :sweat_smile:.

But TB has their 6374 motors rated at 80A continuous. So I can set the motor amperage to 75A continuous to be safe again. I calculate the ERPM beforehand so that it wont exceed 80000ERPM. But how is it possible that the motor can handle and also will receive 75Amps when I only put 45A in? How does that work? Is the amperage inputted somehow transferred into more then 45A by the VESC?
```

[/quote]

Yes.  It's a PWM square wave so, for example, if it was ON at 75A for 63 microseconds and OFF for 87μs, then it would be running at a 42% duty cycle and so the "battery amps" would be 31.5A even though the "motor amps" is 75A

Setup: 6374 maytechs paired with dual focbox on a production board (lacroix). 

Question: If I get 6880s what would have to change settings wise on the focbox to ensure they work correctly? Would it be a new motor detection, calibration and just a tweak of current settings (maybe motor amp max and min?)

At the very least, do a fresh detection (and if they have sensors, calibrate them too). Given that the motors are bigger, you can probably afford to increase the motor amp limit, but that's a matter of preference, and limited by your ESC to some degree. Like @Itsmedant said, if the KV is significantly different, you'll probably ned to do more tweaking than if it's very similar.

Yes, but with a couple huge caveats: the motor shaft will be supported on the opposite end, and it isn't very stiff, which means the tension of the belt will bend it.

If you can build a support bracket right at the pulley, then it'll be fine. But if you're going to that much work, you might as well just figure out how to turn the motor around.

Please make that information available to the community as a whole.  Batteries are too dangerous to allow bad manufacture to go unannounced.  The more bad packs that are floating around under the guise of professionally built units the more likely we are to receive bad press and more restrictions.  Post your concerns in the battery thread.  Be aware that there is a strict no vendor bashing rule on the forum but supplying dangerous packs is something that should be made public.

All USB is 5V by standard (talking about everything 2.0 and not USB C/3.0 standard).  The new standard allows for higher voltage but there's "negotiation' that happens with the device so the device basically pulls a line high or low to indicate to the charger to go into high power mode then it's somewhere around 24V I believe (for charging laptops etc.)

With different 5V adapters you'll see the output amperage rating on them varies, if the charge circuit in your device limits the current lower than the adapter can put out then there's no issue.  If the charge circuit doesn't limit the current then it may draw up to however much current the adapter can put out, typically if you draw more than that I believe the adapter will heat up and either switch on and off or dip in power (think this depends on switching power supply or not but details here are where I get lost).

I just bought a little USB power tester that shows how much actual current is flowing from an adapter to a device (because I'm curious about these things).
https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01D9Y6ZFW/

With a device like the above it gives you Watts read out so you can divide Wh on the device by Watts being delivered and assuming it's off or not using much power can calculate time to charge pretty accurately.

I hate to break it to you, but I doubt you'd be able to find a machinist willing to make you a one-off custom motor for much less than that. 

The original naming convention for brushless motors was based on the size of the stator, not the size of the outer can.

So while I was riding today, I hit a bump and for some reason in my case the VESC disconnected one of its connectors to the motor so only one motor ran(running split ppm). So now when I reconnected the motor to the vesc, now both motors aren’t reacting to my ppm controller.

So then I went back to check the settings on my vesc and try to reset the input settings, but now it’s saying the vesc doesn’t detect any signal from the ppm control. I checked all the lights and the VESC’s both light up and are fine as well as the remote control receiver’s light and they all light up.

Could it be my ppm cables are bad or my splitter is bad? Please help

So I tried connecting the VESC and switched the VESC for each motor via BLDC tool and it worked for motor detection so I'm assuming the only issue lies within the input (so either ppm cable or remote/receiver). The receiver shines blue and when I connect it to the BLDC input wizard, the sensor shows an input, but my remote doesn't move the signal. Do you think its input?

I.e. 
20 awg on P- and B-
16 or 18 awp on the charge port

This is to be connected together using deans. 

Why use different awg? Well these are the only ones I have at the moment.

Unless you have an oscilloscope, you can buy [another receiver](https:///collections/remote-controller/products/2-4ghz-mini-receiver) and swap them to find out

That remote supports multiple receivers anyway, so you could put one receiver on each ESC if it turns out to not be bad.

If you had the receiver connected with a split ppm cable and you had all three cables connected on both legs theres a good chance you have sent too much voltage to the receiver.  Other than that those remote receiver combos are pretty much bullet proof.

New to building. I'm trying to make a Trampa style electric mountain board. I'm wondering how to lengthen the motor sensor cables so they can make it to my ESC which is in the box in the middle of the board. I'm decent (at best) at soldering so would prefer a premade cable that can extend the wires like 12-18 inches. Any suggestions? Or is this the wrong move and I should just move the ESC closer and wire that to the box?

Did you still have the bind loop in the receiver?  It may have had power disconnected and then needs to be rebound.

You should only disconnect power after the bind loop is removed so it remembers your transmitter.

UNRELATED: If I put 2 nails in the jumper cables of a 900CCA 12v car battery and tap them to a battery with a 0.2x10mm nickel plate, will it work?

No comments on if I will die, the answer is yes and I've already made a will, the board goes to my cat

If it does weld, it will weld way too hot because the power won't shut off after XX milliseconds.

You could probably figure that out by testing it on your tongue first. If you die you did it too long. I shoot for second to third degree burns. Should make a perfect weld.

You'd go through so many expensive multi-ten or multi-hundred ampere fuses to find out, that it'd be cheaper just to use a spot welder.  Plus, you'd need a new large fuse and a fresh battery for ***each*** weld.

Best idea is to buy pre-welded P-packs from a forum battery expert, and then make a battery with those.  No spot welder needed.

Thats a strange one if the remote is powering one motor.  Has to be a cable issue.  If the remote is activating one vesc and the vescs are both fine then it can only be a split ppm cable problem.  Try switching them around.

@perpetual-motion many trampa-style builds I've seen have the ESCs  mounted above the rear truck, behind tthe rear foot, which keeps the wires to the motors nice and short - you just have to have two wires from the battery to the ESCs, rather than sixteen (3 phases, power, ground and U, V, W hall outputs per motor) like you'd need if you had the ESCs in the middle.

@perpetual-motion
As @venom121212 said, the most easy way is to cut the sensor wires and solder an extension to it.
If you don’t want to solder at all you can get a 1.5mm 6pin to 2mm 6pin jst.
From there you can get multiple male/female adapter cables you can find easy online to order.
This adapters usually max 20-30cm so you need to look how much you would need.
One thing to consider with it, you have multiple connections, so multiple places where the plugs can be disconnected unfortunately.

Hey guys,

finally started my first build. Sadly one of the motor mount I ordered from DIYesk8 was missing screws to secure the clamp to the trucks. 
I have no idea what the reference of those are. If anyone here know can he enlighten me on this ?
In the picture here, these are the ones on the left without a screw head.
I've tried chatting with them but I waited 1h yesterday, I was still in the queue and it was bed time :stuck_out_tongue:

They're called setscrews or grub screws. I'd guess m6 by about 12mm long. You can get them online, or at most hardware stores. (Don't get the cheap chinese ones, they're made of cheese, rather than steel.)

I get most of my fasteners from boltdepot.com, or mcmaster.com.
Don't forget to use threadlocker on all those, you don't want anything coming loose during a ride.

So guys I have a choice to make about batteries and charging of them and I would like your help. So here is the situation. I have got a 12S setup with 3x4S lipos rated to charge up to 10A continuous. I currently have a small reaktor 250W charger but I don't have a big power supply just a cheap one. It is 19v at 3A. But because the reaktor only takes ...-18v`s the guys form hobbyking recommended me to charger at 2A, so I won't blow the fuse (I think that was the reason if I remember correctly). 
At this point I am like 95% done with my board and I just want to ride it. A couple of friends of mine live in a village about 10 km away from me, so I always ride there to hang out. But since I am upgrading to dual 6374`s my range will drop with about 60% ish. 
Now I have the choice to upgrade my charging (in 2 variations) or get a new set of batteries, so I can just swap them and get back for sure. 

Upgrading my charger solution 1:
I get a new power supply for my Reaktor, so I will be able to charge my battery at 10A. The thing with this solution is that I will always have to open my enclosure, so I can't screw it down. The other thing is that when I charge them I have to set a voltage I want to charge them to. If the situation occurs that I have to go home quickly no matter the situation I will have one battery low on voltage which will bottleneck the total capacity so it will just discharge from that percentage. That's because I am only allowed to charge at 6S max. Great choice for the 4S afterwards. Didn't know too much about batteries back then :grin:. 
If I go with this solution I have a question. About the power supply I will need. Since the reaktor can charge up to 6S to a total of 250W I will be able to charge the 4S at 10A that I know. But my power supply does that have to supply a wattage of 250W+ and then I am good to go or are there some sort of limitations to watch out for? For instance if the power supply is rated at  6A does that mean I can only charge at 6A? Maybe something else like if the voltage is higher than 22.2 of the power supply it will blow a fuse in the turnigy reaktor? I have no Idea haha Teach me please :slight_smile:.

Upgrading my charger solution 2:
I make a BMS and wire it up for charging. The thing with this is that I will have to buy a new charger for 12S and that that charger will probably rated for 12s at only 5A. I also kind off eliminate the usage of being able to swap out batteries since I will be screwing my enclosure down. That also gives me an advantage because I will be able to make my board look nicer and gets rid of the need to open it up as mentioned earlier.

The 3rd option was to buy new batteries:
This one kind off explains itself. I just get a couple of new batteries, so I will always be able to ride home if needed. 

So what would you guys do if you were in the same situation? Does anyone have experience with these type of situations?
If I got something wrong just tell me I am here to learn haha. :smile:

Solution 2 is way, way, way better than solution 1.  You CANNOT use the battery if the the three packs aren't balanced, you will end up destroying the batteries.

Solution 3 is overkill.  You have batteries.

Also I don't advise making your board such that you must open the enclosure to charge it.

Ah oke thanks for the feedback. Will implement the second one then :slight_smile:. Any recommendations on 12S chargers that are good and reliable? Looked around a bit, but they didn't seem to come above 4A is there a reason why? Or didn't I just look good enough?

They exist, they're just not as common. You might have to get one from Aliexpress or similar rather than the more common sellers like Amazon. They're a little more expensive, since the higher the current, the more power they have to dissipate. 

Keep in mind that charging a 12s pack at 4A is still faster than charging your 4s packs one at a time at 10A.

Nothing wrong with using a used board as a base.  There are so many things you can do to improve it.  One thing though is to check the hardware is not completely shot.  Baseplates and pivots etc are not damaged or too worn. Wheels are true and not wobbly to the point of discard.  Otherwise you end up with a deck that cost you too much instead of a complete that was a bargain.

You can spend a couple hours with a a dremel or drill press and make the hanger ends of paris trucks perfectly round and use @psychotiller RIPBA mounts or virtually any caliber mount (just drill it out to make it fit a round hanger).  Using grub screws with pre-drilled slots and loctite, they will never move.  

The benefit?  Paris trucks ride so much better than Caliber 2 trucks, they also last longer and the bushing seat is a hack and slash job like C2's so your bushing last a lot longer.

The P group is each set of cells that are turned the ***same*** way and connected together, so in this case, the three on the left that are welded, should have fishpaper between them and the next three that are turned upside down.

Search for any of the many fires on the forum and how they wish they had done it properly instead of burning up a few K in an instant, strongly recommend taking your time with the battery and monitoring it a lot (especially at first but also periodically)

One is a switch that usually connects to ground when it either plugged or unplugged, depending on the model.  You can just not use that one.  It's for determining whether something is plugged-in or not.

@ZachTetra You'll probably trip the over current protection in the pwoer supply. You won't damage anything, but it won't behave right.

@pookybear the third pin is switched when you insert the plug. Leave it unconnected unless you need it for something. 

@paulbriz experiment to find the best spot welding settings. You want a weld that is so strong that it'll leave a little piece of the strip behind when you try to remove it. 
For dewelding, peel off the strips and then use a Dremel or something to smooth out the battery terminals again.
Don't use anything plastic for insulation under the nickel, use fish paper because it's heat and abrasion resistant. 

@yelnats8j powder coat looks great and is very tough, but it adds thickness more than paint or anodizing (anodizing adds none at all), so if you have any critical dimensions, it can mess with them.

Hey everyone! I have a question regarding different motor options. Specifically, I am confused as to the difference between the Maytech sealed 6355 motor, and Maytech sealed 6374 motor.

Both motors are available in 170kv and 190kv options, both are sensored. Both support 2-12s voltages (so I'm assuming max around 50.4V), and both support a max current of 65A. If we dismiss the 1 entry on aliexpress that states that the 6355 motor has a max wattage of 2000, and 2800 (on the same page, I know :man_facepalming: ), then the correct wattages appear to be 3510W for the 6355, and 3550W for the 6374. The difference in price between the 2 motors appears to be around $20.

So, my question!

Besides heat dissipation, is there any reason to pick the heavier and more expensive 6374 motor? If the max current and voltage limits and kv are the same, then both of these motors should produce the same amount of torque and max speed, right? (Especially since 50.4V * 65A = 3276W, less than stated in the motor's descriptions!) Or is the bigger motor bound to be more energy efficient?

Also, since I'm planning a single motor drive for my younger brother on just 10S, do I even need to worry about heat? I'd love to hear your thoughts!

Sidenote: I do see a lot of listings saying that max current for the 6355 is 50A, and rated for 55A. Could the listings stating 65A for the 6355 just be erroneous? Or are there just a lot of different models / options? :smiley:

Two trains of thought.  1.  Your brother I'm assuming is light so weight is not an issue so realistically speaking a single drive 6355 will get him about just fine and when he eventually gets heavier he can add another motor as and when he needs it.
2.  6374 single drive will do him fine now and even when hes heavier if you don't live in San Francisco or an equivalent hilly area.

Take what motor manufacturers state with a grain of salt to be honest.They err on the side of caution.  Its best to use the specs as a guide not gospel.  Do your own testing and see what works.  Its all about the heat.   A 6374 will run the same motor amps as a 6355 but will not get as hot which in reality means it will last longer.  I guarantee that you can run the 74 version of the maytech motor at a higher motor max than the 55 with the same temp readings.
As @briman05 says its probably best to set him up with the 6374 now as if hes anything like my youngest son he will eventually want a fire breathing dragon with twin big cans.

If you use a scrub screw with blue loctite you don’t really need to loctite the pulley with green one too.
If you afraid the pulley moves you can dremel a small flat spot on the motor shaft. That should fix the pulley like bulletproof 😉

If you use a scrub screw with blue loctite you don’t really need to loctite the pulley with green one too.
If you afraid the pulley moves you can dremel a small flat spot on the motor shaft. That should fix the pulley like bulletproof

Hmm. maybe I try this on my new replacement pulley

[quote="b264, post:4229, topic:9559, full:true"]
Where did you get that specific pulley puller? Mine sucks ass compared to that one…
[/quote]
From amazon. Is really good but I also had to buy a m8 x 20mm screw cos the tip of the puller isnt long enough to go all the way thru if that makes sense. Those jaw pullers you see are a fucking joke. They can never get a good grip on the pulley.

I'm thinking about making a pulley puller that looks much like that, except has bolts on the bottom to grip the pulley with, like the bolts in the middle.  And is longer with a longer and bigger center bolt

This thing is a piece of crap but so far has worked

Yeah, the centre bit on this one is too thick. My pulley bore is 8mm so I just used the 8mm screw to mcgyver it. 

You would have to be careful with using bolts at the bottom cos it might be too thick to fit the space between the pulley and motor mount.


edit: dude I already had the exact same one. how the fuck do you grip the pulley with this thing? it kept slipping lmao. i overnighted the amazon puller for that reason.

So.... This keyway I have is a big PITA to install. It's hard to get it into the rotor groove. I could sand it a little to get it in there but I read somewhere here that "most" people don't even use it. Additionally, they said it rattles/makes noises over time.

Quick forum search yields the use of loctite (640?) to install the motor pulley or make a flat spot and use grub screws. How effective are these methods?

I'm leaning towards just the grub screws as I can see myself switching gear ratios. Plus, the motor shaft already has flat spots 

Grub screws ftw or both?

I would try the set screw with threadlock on the screw first but make sure it has a flat spot and not a point. I would try it first by spinning the motor with a belt on it and see how it goes without being on it.

Use the keyway.  Sand a bit if needed.  The keyway is a much, much more robust solution than any loctite or grub screw.

If you care about rattles and stuff, once it's all working and survives a single <1 mile test ride, then take everything back apart and put it together with loctite and whatnot, and at that point add a drop of superglue to the key

If it doesn't have one, make a flat spot in the motor shaft where 1 of the grub screws hits and use blue loctite, just a couple of drops on opposite sides of the shaft and on the grub screws. 

Do this and it's much easier to remove the pulley for maintenance and replacement. I don't use keyways because they make noise and they aren't necessary if you do what I suggest above.

Take it to your local machine shop and have them do it? It can be done with an endmill if you/they don't have a broach set (which is the "correct" tool for the job.) If you were REALLY motivated you could do it with a set of files and/or a drill/dremel and appropriate bits.

Is it okay to have the loopkey between the P- point if the BMS and the connector that goes to the ESC?

I'd imagine as long as it disconnects the ESC but leaves the BMS/charge port/battery connected its good enough but I'm not 100% sure

Putting it anywhere else will waste a bunch of connections to make a series connector with the loopkey inbetween the BMS and ESC, or I'd have to redo all the connections on the BMS to get the loopkey on the correct side of the charging port positive line

Absolutely correct old son.  Good idea to fuse the charge port also.  Most fires happen when charging lithium batteries.  Fuse on the port cuts the connection.

hello i, changed the vesc settings to 35a and it feels like it improved but problem still happens were it cuts out i can get like 40 meters . im thinking it may be the reciver but im not too sure any idias , 10s battery voltage is at 33.6v and cut of is at 30v

Your 10S battery is measuring 33.6V?

That means you need to charge the battery, it has like 0.5% left

 So In the past, I was building a FrankenBoard (Previous Post), weirdly enough it worked perfectly. I had a Top speed of around 35km/h and a range of around 20km (The chain wasn't aligned properly so it drew way more current to run than necessary). 

I am currently working on a larger Trike using the same 12S5P Battery Pack I built out of Samsung30Q's. I wanted some advice on whether or not [ this 800W motor](https://www.miromax.lt/en/m-6/c-39/c-45-brushless_bldc_motor_with_permanent_magnet/product-52-three-phase_permament_magnet_motor_800w_blt-800#tog109) would suffice and if I could still use my FOCBOX with it (It seems to have the sensor wires so it should work).  BTW its only a trike in the sense that it has 3 wheels, it's more like a [Soap Box Cart](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&source=images&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjbwoKJlqjgAhWDIDQIHeZMDZoQjRx6BAgBEAU&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theunion.com%2Fnews%2Flocal-news%2Fthe-rusty-rockets-of-san-joses-don-schafer-wins-5th-annual-nevada-city-adult-soapbox-derby%2F&psig=AOvVaw1BnLleBvrgmbynEsnP_EzM&ust=1549579063626036) with a 13inch back wheel and 2 8inch MBS front wheels. 

Also I am open to any other motor suggestions, (Though I am trying to use a single powerful if possible, just for simplicity) 

My goal is a Top speed of ~60km/h, range of ~40km with a 3:1 ratio.

It should work fine with the focbox, and should work even without the sensors if that ends up being a problem.
800w is a little low compared to esk8 motors, especially for $200+ and a 60km/h speed goal. But if that's what you want to use, I don't see an immediate problem.

Based on some quick and dirty calculation (I ran the numbers in an e-bike calculator), assuming you can match the rolling/wind resistance of a recumbent bike, it'll be just barely able to hit 60km/h on level ground on full throttle. Take this with a pound of salt, I could have made a mistake and the numbers I got might be off significantly. But just an educated wild-ass guess, it'll be a little underpowered and you'd be better off using a different motor. 

Keep in mind that as long as you get your gear ratio correct, watts matter more than torque at the motor. 1000rpm and 9nm of torque is not better than 6000rpm and 5nm of torque. (960 watts, vs 3000.)

For a trike you could always go with a bigger motor like the ones from alien power systems. The 80100 motors output 7,000 watts, which is plenty.

So you will not increase the power output with them.

You could also just modify some existing pulleys if you have access to machine shop metalworking tools.  Get a regular aluminum pulley from someone like @JLabs and go to town modifying it.

The thing I suggest doing that is make sure you only grab wheel core and don't grab polyurethane at all.

I've never modified for ABEC-style cores, but I have a tip from modifying ABEC pulleys to fit kegel style cores --

I intentionally put the bolts 1 degree too far on each side, so they really grip the core tight.  So half the bolts are 1 degree too far forward on the rotation, and the other half are 1 degree too far rearward on the rotation.  Really makes it so there is no slippage at all.

Sorry for the slow reply still working out how to use this. I know it's old but I've never had issues with that type of remote. It's never got stuck and thrown me off the board. I widen the opening of the maytech remote  thinking it was sticking to the top part of the case. That didn't work. I've opened up the remote and see the lever mechanism is the issue. It sticks in full throttle and braking. Not good. Is there another type of remote I can use with that esc? Or do I go back and buy wowgo/ meepo esc which are slower but tried and tested by the hundreds. Thanks for your support.

I haven't used the Maytech ESC, but as I remember it there are those three wires where you connect a reciever for the remote. So I assume that you should be able to use any remote reciever combination but actually the Maytech remote you are using is one of the more popular choices here. I would contact the seller too, as @b264 suggested and replace the remote with the apropriate one. Don't cheap out on remotes it's the most important interface to control your board. Actually the remote you linked stuck several times in my case and had drop out issues.

If you use the I max b6 Charger you will need about 3.5h to charge one 6s pack without balancing time. It’s not an issue, but some people get confused with the charger rating.
It’s not a 5A charger, it’s a 60w charger.
You need to take your nominal voltage which would be 22,2V and devide the Watts through it.
60w / 22,2v =  2,7A Maximum

If you can, measure the voltage on all of the 10 parallel packs individually.
If one of the packs is off with the voltage than you need to swap it out to a new one.

Haha great! I have exactly the same charge ports from aliexpress and was worried to charge above 4A. The seller says up to 12A but that sounds way too much. Such charge ports are often rated with 4-6A when looking at electronic stores. But on the other hand they sell 8A charger with this system.

I have no idea if it's good but if it works for you it could work for me, too. :grin:

@pookybear @rich @accrobrandon  
I was also debating using the 5.5x2.1mm for 8A charging but they are all rated up to 5A except one which is rated at 7A (but requires the super-long barrel plugs, and I don't want to change all ten chargers)

But I thought they'd probably work at 8A -- especially if it wasn't charged at 8A every single time, but only sometimes

Hearing this is confirming what I was thinking

I don't waterproof the jack itself, just make sure water can't get past the jack.

The high-voltage circuits are less affected by water than the low-voltage ones.  If it filled up with water it might waste a few watt-hours of charge but overall shouldn't be too bad.

You do want to keep sand and other debris out though with a cap

I wouldn't recommend either of those. Both hot glue and double sided tape have thermal limits, and hot glue also gets weak and brittle in the cold. I'd recommend screws if possible, or epoxy (both surfaces sanded rough), or maybe a urethane construction adhesive like liquid nails, as long as you've tested it for strength and compatibility with the materials it's sticking to. You want the absolute strongest attachment you can get, with some flex.

Imagine taking the completed board and slamming it on the floor as hard as you can for an hour straight. That's the kind of abuse an esk8 takes from vibration, so construct accordingly.

Guys, while we are talking about charging. I have 3  x 42v chargers (1.5a, 1.8a, 3.5a) and I took a multimeter to them. Not one of them actually measures 42v. They range from 41.5v to 41.9v

Is that normal behaviour? Is it something to do with cc-cv charging?

Not that I really care but I am worried that the bms doesn't kick in at all to balance the cells at the end cos it never hits 42v :frowning:

You need to get it out of there.  Use a sharp drill bit that is smaller than the outside threaded section but big enough to remove the inside core.  Once you have drilled it then use a small flat bladed screwdriver to wedge out the outside threaded section from the deck.  If you get it right the wall of the insert will be thin enough to break away from the deck and leave the outside thread cut into the deck intact.  If you get it wrong you will have to up the size of the new insert.

If it's the internal thread that's stripped, you can repair it using a heli-coil kit. Basically you drill out the old thread with a specific size drill, tap it with a special tap, and then insert a special spring that forms new threads that are stronger than the original.

This will only work if there's a good amount of extra material left for the heli-coil to hold on to, if it's too thin after being drilled and tapped, the brass will just break.

If it's stripped, (as in, threads are gone) then a tap will do nothing because there will be nothing left to tap.

Unless you go to the next bolt size, which has its own  set of problems.

I don't know why it does that, but a cutout to "idle" during hard acceleration can feel like hard braking even though it's just "lack of power".  So, are you sure it's brakes -- or could it be idle?

Roll through the same exact place the cutout happened, except not at full throttle.  Does it still cutout? 

Try to isolate if it's because of the throttle position or because of the physical location...

You know actually, I wonder if your phase wires or your ESC moves slightly under heavy acceleration and it's shorting your phase wires to each other

Although that should blow the ESC FETs right away, I have seen it happen and the FETs didn't blow, and I still don't know how they didn't.  But it's something I've seen.

That exact problem would cause those exact symptoms.

Check your phase wires insulation and see if your ESC is moving around inside the case and shorting on something

If you want waterproof and protection, there are ways to do that, but WD-40 is not the way

MG Chemicals Acrylic Conformal Coating (in the 55ml brush-on bottle) on any heatsinks and motor sensor boards and windings
and
MG Chemicals Modified Silicone Conformal Coating (in the 55ml brush-on bottle) on everything else, like the circuit boards and stuff

That will make it waterproof.  (which is different from water-resistant)

Based on the video, it looks like the controller loses sync with the motor. Does it also respond that way if you go from part-throttle to full-throttle, or only from stop? Also, are you running sensors? It might be worth it to redo your calibration if so.

I had something similar with two ESCs over canbus, the slave would stutter a little. I seem to remember that copying the exact config of the master over to the slave and then changing only the couple parameters (enumeration etc) that were required, fixed it for me.

No, it doesn't do it when partially throttle to full. I have recalibrated a few times unless I'm doing wrong. I have the unity so no slave.

Both of them.  Then see if the opposite motor does that, the opposite motor does something else, the same motor does that, the same motor does something else, or the problem is gone.

Battery building keeps getting safer and safer as people figure out better ways and we see what's failed before and how.  Electric skateboards are one of, if not the single most destructive environment to put a lithium battery into.  Combine that with the failure method of burning down and perhaps leaving you at full speed with no brakes, and it's very important the battery is made correctly.

The suggestions you were given as already mentioned have originated by trying to eliminate all the failures people have had through the years of building packs for esk8s. Noboby knows for sure if a battery pack will burst out in flames, all we can do is try and take out as many variables as we can.

@b264

Things I tried to get my issue to work:
FOC sensored - (preferred defaulted setting) same results 
FOC sensorless - same result
FOC hybrid - same result
BLDC - magic smoke (bad motor only)

Sadly, I didn't get the to switch the wires like you suggested. I already ordered new motors last night. 

So check this out, unity still works (powers on, able to connect via bluetooth). I decided to hook it up to my PC to see if I could somehow check the logs. It wouldn't connect. Hmmm maybe the cable wasn't "seated" right, which happened the first time I did this. I go unplug the cable. The flipping port came out with it :face_with_symbols_over_mouth::rage:. I was like WTF. It seemed like the port is not soldered to the board. It was held on to the board by 4 small hooks. 

So boys and girls, be careful when you unplug the cable from the type C port. Those thing aren't soldered to the board. At least mine didn't.

You give very less info on what you want to build.
There multiple answers to your questions possible but for this you need to tell a bit more.
The case you can just bolt on or drill some threads in your deck... again we don’t even know which deck you have.
I also still don’t get why you want to charge two LiIon packs at one time if you but everything in your enclosure you have only one battery there.
Charge only bms I would say d140 from bestech rocks always.

I want to clean some of the electronics for the upcoming spring before I attempt to dust/water/whateverproof my enclosure, so I decided to ask for some advice here.

 If I wanted to clean my ESC of all the dust and dirt, would it be okay to just dunk it in a bowl of rubbing alcohol and let it sit there for a while? I've heard nice things about cleaning PCBs that way.

 What about the motors?
 I'm running hub motors and I think they need a cleaning as well, because there's this weird "flopping" sound when accelerating with load (load would be me in this case). How would I go about cleaning the motors?

Hi, I am trying to build my first electric skateboard. While I was researching I stumbled across the [FOCBOX Unity](https://www.enertionboards.com/focbox-speed-controller/focbox-unity-dual-motor-foc-controller-esc/) on sale. I'm not done with my research, but this looks like a huge saving. Should I order it before I finished my research? Or is there a better VESC? 

I would like my board to have the following features:
 - A board of around 100cm
 - Dual motor setup
 - Top speed of around 45kmph
 - Range of 40km
 - 10s5p or 12s4p liion battery
 - Budget of 1100 euro (+/- 200 euro) 
 - Located in The Netherlands 🇳🇱

Thanks!

enertion has very often discount codes and special offers.
so you definitly don´t need to worry that you ever will need to pay the full price you can see on the website.
the bigger problem with the unity is the availability.
if you order now, the planed shipping is beginning of march if there still unitys left from the batch.
if all of them sold, we don´t know yet how long it will take till the next batch is ready for shipping. this can take some month.
maybe somebody from the enertion team can give a short update if there still unitys availaible from the feb/march batch and when the next batch is planed to be back in stock.
@barajabali @CarlCollins  

Besides this I would say for now you can´t make anything wrong by ordering a unity for your build. so far they seem to be solid ;)

Almost exclusively on pretty long, straight paved roads. I want to use it for commuting around. As I'm in the Netherlands I have great bike roads with little to no elevation. As I would take it on campus in class I don't want it to be too big. Having stability and compact size is pretty much mutuality exclusive I've seen, so I'm looking for some compromise.

That hummie deck looks interesting. I think I would want the one on the left with belt driven motors. I'll shoot bigben a message if he still has some decks in Europe.

You probably want something like this

https://www.muirskate.com/longboard/decks/55251/earthwing-muirderer-fallen-one-37-longboard-skateboard-deck-w-grip

for a compact size only issue you can run into is that you would have to probably run a double stack for your batteries to get the size battery that you want on a smaller board.

Not getting any output through the power XT90 in this diagram, can anybody see any flaws? Charging port works and anti-spark plug is plugged in. Will replace the generic low quality BMS if the diagram would work normally.

Did you check the voltage on the leads including the xt90 connectors? It should read something. Also your antispark should be a XT90s not an XT90.

**XT90s** females are antispark, **XT90** females are not. But if you aren't getting any power from the battery then something is wrong. you need to check your voltages with a multimeter to see if you are getting any power at all. Maybe you didn't wire something on the IRL battery.

I believe most users here run charge only here due to "battery max/current?" limitations. This is what I understood from reading about it and also why I opted for charge only. I could be wrong though.

Is there a good thread or can someone shed some light on motor KV and why the trend seems to be using a higher KV motor and gearing it down vs running a lower KV motor with less gear reduction ?

Like say a 190KV motor, 10s with 15/36 gearing vs 100KV motor, 10s with 28/36 gearing
Playing with this calculator http://calc.esk8.it both would have about the same max top speed.

I keep reading about people worried about ERPM limit and a lower KV motor with less gearing keeps further away from the limit.

Looking at specs sheets the lower KV motor's are listed as having more torque and I'd think with the higher tooth count drive gear that it would be less likely to slip as more teeth engaged and surely the higher motor RPM has to incur additional losses from friction and what not.

Is it just a matter of availability of lower KV motors and higher tooth count drive gears ? 
Is it just because that's the way it's always been done and easier to follow what you know works ?
or is there something else I have missed all together ?

If you look into e-mtbing a ton of people recommend motors from 130-170kV.
Wouldn’t say that higher kV is the trend people go.

A lot depends on your needs and your build in general.
Also gearing up/down is also limited by wheel diameter. If I think about a 8“ pneumatic wheel I have already clearance issues with 72th wheel pulley. To go more high would make the belt rub on the street 😅
Same with motor pulley. Below 13th the contact of the belt is just too less.

Okay I was meant to be asleep an hour ago but just got finished reading both of those topics (would have been done sooner if I didn't have to work...)

Still doesn't really cover off what I'm trying to find. I would probably be surprised if someone has done it but something like a dyno sheet comparing 
190KV motor, 10s with 15/36 gearing vs 100KV motor, 10s with 28/36 gearing
Theoretically they probably have the same output but my guess is there would be a difference.
Like stick a 100kg / 220lb rider on and have them go from a stand still up a slight hill, would the lower KV motor have more punch off the line to mid and the higher KV one have more in the top end ?

The main problem is getting a huge 28 tooth pulley mounted to a wheel. The standard belt spacing determines the tooth size. If you add more teeth, it's not shrinking the teeth to fit the pulley, it's expanding the pulley to accommodate the teeth.

Just placed my order for the Foxbox Unity!

Another question, is my understanding of the different motor types correct?

 - Belt driven motors
This is the standard. It can be a little complicated to work out the [drivetrain](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/beginners-guide-to-building-your-own-electric-skateboard-drivetrain/53?source_topic_id=215). Overall is this a safe choice.
 - Hub motors
Newer type of motors. Are generally cheaper, but a lot less powerfull than other options.
 - Direct drive motors
Newest type of motors. The best, but also the most expensive type. Basically a mix of hub and belt motors, the belt is gone, but the motor is not inside the wheel.

I want to build a pretty stealthy board, so it looks like a normal skateboard if you don't pay attention. I'm planning on using a HAYA board, so the internals will be hidden. To get the stealthy look I have to use direct drive or hub motors, but as I understand it belt driven fits the best. Hub motors are not really powerful enough, and direct drive makes my board over budget (if i use [this motor](https:///products/torqueboards-direct-drive-motor-kit) set, compared to [this](https:///collections/featured-items/products/dual-motor-mechanical-kit) kit + 2 motors of 80,- a piece).

Is this correct, or am I missing something? Are the hub motors really that much worst? Or are there more budget friendly direct drive motors out there?

The rest of my wishes still apply:
[quote="atlasdev, post:4513, topic:9559"]
* A board of around 100cm
* Dual motor setup
* Top speed of around 45kmph
* Range of 40km
* 10s5p or 12s4p liion battery
* Budget of 1100 euro (+/- 200 euro)
* Located in The Netherlands :netherlands:
[/quote]

I would be willing to save up a month more, if the increased budget will improve my board significantly..

I'm sorry in advance if I ask a lot of questions, I **will** ask more :). I just want to do this right the first time.

Thanks!

How wide of a belt is needed for a HDT 3M belt to transfer 700W?  Its a brushed DC motor so it won't have much torque anyway

On the current setup I've got 15mm from the wheel to the mount, so the best I can do is probably 1mm for  each pulley guard and 1mm for clearance (each for belt to guard and guard to mount), so 11mm belt?

If you haven't purchased the motors for your friend I'm selling koowheel hubs that work with VESCs, almost certainly cheaper than the cost of the belt setup, but if that's what he's after then that's all good :)

Just got a replacement mini remote after my Nano-x... incident... the other day. Few questions I have:
1) what do st trim and th (throttle I'm guessing) trim do exactly?
2) I've seen reference to the thumb wheel being used like a cruise control. Is this the standard function of that wheel?

The thumb wheel is just a second PWM channel just like the trigger.  You can hook it up to your throttle if you wanted to.

One of these days I'm going to make a lights/bell/horn controller that uses the second channel....unless someone else makes one first that I can buy.

I don't know much about them because they've never failed on me.  The power switch is the first thing that fails on a mini remote.

BE GENTLE WITH THE POWER SWITCH if you want it to last.  Seems if you're very gentle each time you use it, it lasts much, much longer

The only reason why I ordered it before you even posted is that based on your website description, you could move the motor laterally ±10mm laterally to tighten/loosen the belt tension. So I figured I added or subtracted 10mm to/from ~85mm and plug it into the BBman website.

I'm not sure if this logic is correct. Just taking chances here. Haha. Hopefully, it works.

X-slots can fit any 63xx motors regardless of their diameter mounting hole pattern.  Down side to this is lateral adjustment is restricted, belt tensioning is thru the adjustment of idlers. :point_down:

Hey guys, so I would like to charge my lipo`s all at the same time, so I figured getting a BMS would be the way to go. I did some research and got this scheme.  If you see something thats off please correct me :slight_smile: 
![0|690x441](upload://8rho2q9AfDRUsOwF6Za5opJL6Tm.png) 
I am planning on getting 2 chargers 1 now and 1 for group rides in the future for fast charging. The standard charger is on 40% of my total charge max (10A is my rated max for charging, so I am going to charge at +-4A. Read that staying at 40% of your max charge will keep your cells cycles at an almost optimum level. For group rides I will be charging at 7-8A but that's a charger I will buy in the future :slight_smile:. 

I am planning on getting this charger. The guys form esk8.nl told me that its reliable and does the job well. Its loud but I dont mind. I will get the xt90 plug since I have a bunch of them and that way I dont have to struggle with buying a charging port from lets say a hoverboard. Is that a good idea? Or would you do it diffirent let me know :smiley:

On a Bms I didnt really decide. I currently saw these ones. If you know a good 12s bms that goes up to 10A+ in the EU I would appreciate it if you could link me one.

Ah wait my mistake, I think your diagram is fine lol. I looked too close to those balance leads and thought all the negative terminals of each battery was connected. But you will need all the positive terminals to be connected to the BMS balance leads wise.

Second, P- is for discharge only. You need to use CH- for charging and then you can either run the BMS bypassed or use it for discharge.

This is how I lay out my BMS. If you don't have a 13th balance lead then you don't need to put a negative balance lead.
-Based on my diagram displayed here, it's a 11 pin balance lead layout.
-Also it is bypassing the BMS.

Edit: my battery is 10s, also note that this is per every cell parallel group

This won't work, it will blow the BMS.  The balance wires are off-by-one.

There will either be B0 through B12 or B1 through B12 for a 12S BMS

I haven't ever seen B-1 through B13

Look in here.  This is a 2 x 5S for 10S total, but same idea

You're right but @epster's diagram is not right.

Also B-1 through B13 is 15 wires and I only see 13 on the photo and B0 and B1 are missing

Not paying attention to details or assuming things don't matter is the fastest way you are going to break something very expensive and have to buy it again.

So to get this clear for me. my current wiring from the batteries towards the bms (balance wires) is wrong. But the wiring for the positive and negatives from the batteries and the charge port is correct?

Edit:

I used this BMS as reference and that had 13 wires and that's how i setup and based my scheme on. https://www.ebay.com/itm/12S-15A-Balance-Protect-Circuit-PCM-BMS-for-43-2v-44-4v-Li-ion-Li-Po-Battery-873/323217175378?hash=item4b413eb352:g:qooAAOSwNvxa2rCm:rk:1:pf:0&LH_ItemCondition=3

Sorry :sweat_smile: I will look it up next time, was on the fly till now. But from the looks of the BMS itself, there are 13 leads from the first link and then 12 from the second link to the BMS. 

From your diagram @epster , based off the first 13 lead BMS, it looks fine. It's just that you need to make sure that B-1 is connected to the bottom of the pack (negative), which is fine. This particular BMS also has a CH- unlike the other link you had first posted which is fixed in your recent diagram. All in all, to me the diagram is fine. Not sure why @b264 sees that it is wrong.

Edit: nvm I think both BMS's have their own dedicated CH- port, it's super unclear from just the photos on ebay lol, still all looks good though.

EDIT: Oh hahah that explains. So just a quick summary for me. I will wait for others to confirm too just to be sure :grin:. If i get a 13 lead bms like a linked. That has a B1- port Thats the one that has to have the negative wire wired up the rest just in order how I wired them up. The port that says CH- is the port that I will attatch my power plug too. This is how I am supposed to do it right?

You just need to make sure you are connecting the balance leads appropriately. for ex if there was 12 leads only (meaning no negative balance wire), the wires should go in series of voltage from B1 to B12. Always be safe and check with a Voltage meter. If there was a BMS layout it would have been easier lol

Edit: I busted a BMS because I had the leads the other way around and the BMS was trying to regulate the voltage backwards. It got so hot and just didn't allow me to charge anymore. Good thing cheap BMS's are easy to replace and do not much harm (If monitored that is).

Honestly you do you, some people like 13 leads, others is 12 leads. I don't see why it matters with cheaper BMS's. Use the BMS appropriately to the way it's made always.

Next step is to use a better BMS to have faster balancing between cells. Cheapo ones take weeks if not months on bigger battery packs.

So I was looking around a bit but sometimes I couldn't find the balance current for a single cell. Does that mean that that specific BMS balance out the cells? I think its weird to not put that in the specifications since that is like the main purpose of a BMS. This is one example of one i found were i could find that specification.

Also I found that there was a BMS that looked good with the specs but I don't understand how you wire the balance wires up. Since normally you would only wire up the negative 1 time or not at all and the positive 3 times in my case.  But here they drew constant negative and positive wires in the wire scheme. Could someone explain to me how that works. It also has 2 wire plugs but I Don't really know what that's for. If you have some sort of video feel free to link that one. I couldn't find anything I could understand about this.

If it doesn't have a clearly labeled balance current, I would absolutely NOT buy it.

Think about this -- even if it does balance the cells -- the seller doesn't even know enough about BMSs to tell you what that important measurement is.  Are you going to trust that person with not setting your home on fire?

Exactly.

Just buy a bestech BMS.

I don't think that specific BMS has B0.  Only B1 through B12.  So the top-most balance wire (the black one) is not connected because that potential is taken from B- instead on this model.  If there are extra B13 and up, do not connect them to anything

This looks much better :slight_smile:

Nice to hear that my wiring scheme looks good. I think we can conclude that I learned something hahah. About the part you said it has no B0. When I look at the picture of the BMS. It says B- B1 B2 B3 etc. That B- means battery minus right or also know as B0 If i remember correctly? Here is a pic of the BMS they have on their site.

So there is a B0 on the circuit board then.  It just depends if the one you get actually has that pin on the connector or not.

As long as you don’t have a mad surfer board like @Riako you don’t need 1.5m phase wire extensions.
60cm or two of this extension should be long enough.
You can also easy solder your own extensions. Just get the 3.5mm bullet connectors and some 12awg wire.

To set up the unity is no big deal.
I would read the official unity thread and the support thread. 
If you still have questions than just ask them over there.
People will help with it for sure.

theres always the fact that some dickhead might have taken it apart and not reassembled it correctly yes. This is always a fact of life when dealing with second hand stuff unfortunately.   To be sure you will now need to strip down both the good and the bad to ascertain the issue.  Nice.

1.5m are long but what is wrong with 50-60cm extensions?
I´m not the only one who run long phase wires without issues.
I agree that shorter would be better, but still, 60cm phase wires don´t cause so big voltage spikes that they will damage the vesc.

Would rather have a long battery wire than longer phase wires. 1.5 meters is too long, it's almost an extreme amount. Be minimalistic and make your wires sized appropriately. I worry about noise so having a bigger awg wire like 10 or 12 would help. But yes you are right, not many people have any issues like desyncing.

What he means is that the dremel only spins one way if you have a very high speed set when it hits the fiberglass it could dig in and just start going that one way. A stepper but would be the most controllable option

For a hole of this diameter is not going to be easy to find a drill bit, I recommend to use a file with rounded shape. File and fiberglass work together pretty nicely,  just be careful with the fiber glass dust, is so irritating in your skin!!

Dude a drill bit isnt the way to go you need a stepper bit.  A standard bit would probably ruin the fiberglass since a previous hole is already drilled.  @Bor.inc The step bit would be the quickest and easiest.

This [step bit](https://www.amazon.com/Irwin-11104-Unibit4M-4-Millimeter-22-Millimeter/dp/B00075RG2S/ref=sr_1_2?fst=as%3Aoff&qid=1550584750&refinements=p_n_feature_eleven_browse-bin%3A3622111011%2Cp_72%3A1248921011%2Cp_89%3AIrwin+Tools&rnid=2528832011&s=industrial&sr=1-2) would be what you want. Nice high quality bit.  I have used these with sheet metal and and have done a great job.  Just go slow and it will be fine.

for a beginner like you, a pack that has a S number of 10 would be recommended. Increasing the P number WILL give you more range, but you cant shrink one group and grow the other, you're still ending up with the same amount of cells.  

Do some more research, and remember that if youre going with a 10s battery, the highest kv belt motor you should go for is 190kv.

Engines are from 1970s motorized skateboards.  Motors are from 2010s electric skateboards.  I don't suggest using an engine.  It pollutes, it's loud as fuck, it's big and heavy, it's smelly, you have to buy fuel, you can burn your leg, and there's nowhere to put it on the skateboard because it's too big.

Nah you'll be fine. I see people running them anywhere between 35 and 55 degree angled. Do you know if you have a 35° or 45° baseplate? It's the angle between baseplate top and kingpin I believe. I see more people angling the back higher than the front by 5 or 10 degrees so you could always try only wedging the back (assuming you need motor wheel clearance)

Hey guys, so I am reallllllly close to being done. But I am missing one thing pulleys and belts. I am going to order 50T pulleys and I measured my center distance at about 100 mm for the TB reverse mounted trucks. I calculated the belt length and it got to 280mm. Can this be right?

Try searching for a belt length calculator on this forum.  You'd also have to know how many teeth are on the other pulley though.

Very nooby question. 
For the 2.1mm DC female jack, the 3 pins one. I think I figured out which one is the ground (1x) and which one the positives (2x).

Does it matter which positive pin I soldered the red wire to? Is it even the red wire I am soldering these to?

Be careful and check it with multimeter first. Plug in your charger and measure voltage, if there is a minus before the reading then you have to swap plus and minus.

On my charging port it's like this, the third pin has no internal connection:

VESC tool will detect one side of a dual ESC but not the other half, "Could not autoconnect.  Make sure the USB cable is plugged in and that the VESC is powered"

I literally updated the firmware on that side 30 minutes ago and the other side connects still after the same update, I'm so confused...I didn't do anything to it

How do I fix this?

Hi,
It looks like I don't have permissions to make my own post yet, so I'll ask here:
My motors spin up during detection but then won't move. Here are the details:
I have two Maytech VESCs (came with hardware 4.10 firmware 3.3 upgraded to 3.40) two Maytech Hubmotors with hall sensors, and a 10S Lion battery.

The specs are:

Motors:
Size 90mm
Voltage 24-36V
Max Amps 22A
Max. Output Watt 800W
Resistance 0.557‐0.577

The motors are connected to the VESCs with a hall sensor adapter (and the three phase wires).
 
Battery:

Koowheel 5500 mAh battery
Max Amps: 30A

I tried running the motor setup wizard with these settings:

Max Current: 20A
Max Current Brake: -20A
Battery Current Max: 25A
Battery Current Max Regen: -10A

Voltage Limits: 34V / 31V (10S Lion)

First I tried FOC detection on one of the maytechs, and the motor would spin up, but then when I tried to use the arrow keys in arrow key mode after the setup the motors would cog but not move. The VESC would blink red 3 times when I hit the arrow key.

I tried BLDC mode next on the first maytech and it would spin up in detection but then also not move with the arrow keys. I then tried BLDC on the second maytech and it would move with the arrow keys. I've run the detection multiple times on both VESCs, and sometimes the cogging happens on both and sometimes just the first one. No red blinking lights other than the first time I tried FOC.

Here are the settings that the motor setup detected in BLDC mode:

I 5.00 A
150.0 ERPM
D: 0.05

Detection Results:
Integrator limit: 111.01
BEMF Coupling: 433.58
Detected hall sensor table: 255, 3, 1, 2, 5, 4, 6, 255

I'm wondering if I'm not sending enough current with the arrow keys, or if I burned out the first VESC with FOC mode? 

In the bottom left corner my settings are:
D 0.20, 5000 RPM, IB 3.00 A,
I 3.00 A, P 0.00, HB 3.00 A. 

What should I try changing?

Thanks,

Jordan

Hi guys. Can someone tell me which side of the Velcro strip is supposed to go on the deck and which side on the components? 

I used the soft side on my deck, actually foam pad, but when I jump up and down on it or just bounce my board of the ground the battery falls off. I’m using 13 strips for a 10S5P. It’s rated for 15 lbs so I don’t know what I’m doing wrong.

Since they have brushes, you can wire them in parallel unlike BLDC motors.  In theory you should be able to run two brushed DC motors from one VESC.

The phase wires on a brushed DC motor are internal. Only the power wires are exposed.

This is all theory, I've never tried.  Do at own risk

Don't know anything about castle ESCs but VESC has an option for DC motor.  You only use two of the phase leads and I don't think you need to do motor detection.  I've never done it.  Use a multimeter or search for more information on which 2 of the 3 leads you use.

There is one 10 meter circle inside of which my mini remotes frequently cut-out (5% of the time?).  Outside of that circle, I've never had one cut out before unless the battery is dying.  Never.

It's not even centered [over the intersection](https://www.google.com/maps/place/38%C2%B037'32.1%22N+90%C2%B011'24.3%22W/@38.625583,-90.1906282,229m/data=!3m2!1e3!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x0:0x0!7e2!8m2!3d38.6255832!4d-90.1900808).  Overall, mini remote seems rock-solid.  I don't know what is right there, but it is a major source of RF pollution.

What is different for ESC's between hub motors and normally outrunners ?

From what I can tell Focbox / VESC ect can run both but I keep seeing people talk about with the pre builds that their ESC / motor controller can't be repurposed because it's a hub motor one and can't be reconfigured.

Is it an ERPM limit thing ? do they have a different amount of pole pairs ? are the motors in some way actually different ? 

I thought in essence a hub motor is an outrunner with a low KV that has been stuck inside the wheel, is that not the case ?

That's the case. The ERPM limit might be different, but the main difference is that outrunner motors are MUCH more powerful than hubs, and the prebuilt ESCs are rated for that low power, so they won't be able to run a more powerful outrunner.

I think the simplest thing you could do is buy a pack of tic-tacs and use that box to protect your receiver from shorting out against other things in your enclosure. Also, I use a bit of glue to make sure the receiver to ESC cable doesn't disconnect. :)

Plugged my balance wires plug from a cheap BMS to a proper new BMS, turns out the order was actually reversed in the new BMS. Cue first 470 SMD resistor going red hot and smoking. Running the BMS with the proper balance wire connections has that resistor burning hot with no power output. Is it safe to just replace the 470ohm SMD resistor or do I have to replace the whole board?

It's safe to replace just that 47 ohm (47 x 10^0) SMD resistor -- but it's likely that problem is not the resistor burning, and that's just the symptom of a shorted FET somewhere else.

In general though, using a BMS that's mulfunctioned before is not safe

You could also solder a through-hole resistor there just to test if it will work or not.  It's likely the new resistor will get hot also because it's only a symptom and not a cause.  That could allow you to know quickly with an easily-obtainable part whether or not repair will be possible.

Most standard through-hole resistors are 250mW though, you'd need probably a 1W one

It depends how many cells you use. Li-ion cylindrical cells have a lower power/weight ratio compared to LiPo, but they hold WAY more energy. So you'll need a larger pack to equal the discharge performance of a lipo pack, but you'll also get a far greater range out of the bargain as well.

@porb @ZachTetra A 6355 is 60ish **motor amps**, which doesn't translate to battery amps in a 1:1 ratio. You can run fewer battery amps and the vesc will step down the battery voltage, and step up the motor amps. I'd say a minimum of 30 battery amps per motor is acceptable, 40+ is good. 

The only time you'll really notice the difference is with hard acceleration at speed - It won't affect your top speed, or the initial launch from a standing start. The lower your battery amps, the sooner your acceleration will drop off - Either way, if you punch it from a standstill, the motor will see 60 amps, but it'll drop off faster if you have fewer battery amps. You'll hit the same top speed (Within reason) but it'll take longer with less battery amps.

Its an option but not a good one...you can get 18650 holders on eBay for hella cheap and solder them together, each cell has a separate tab but you can have them in packs of 4 already and they are reversible (I've got a 10s2p about to go on a light cruiser)

The tabs are thin so each cell can't have to many amps but you can carve out the back of the holder and solder 10awg to the contact tab or just use low amp cells and solder to the exterior tab

It's not a good longterm solution but its really nice for testing and cheap/quick/dirty builds...and it doesn't fuck up the cells by overheating them

I would not suggest that at all. Unless you are extremely good at soldering, you are going to be putting way too much heat through your cells, which in the end will deplete the life of them.

If you don't want to spot weld, there are better options out there that are tested and will handle the amperage our boards take.

I have a 12s4p hardware kit for the N.E.S.E. kit that I'm going to sell. Check it out, If you have a 3d printer, its a pretty decent choice.

so I got my motor from Torqueboards a couple of days ago. I was super excited to see that they have a new version out that dealt with some problems the older versions had. Big openings where there was no airflow, sturdier and overall just nicer. So 2 days ago I got to the detection of the motor and everything went smooth. Got botch vesc `s over canbus connected with a master and slave and both detections in FOC worked. So I got to riding it that day with full excitement. I noticed that I left my backtruck too lose so I got speedwobble. I turned arround and got back home because I forgot my T-tool. 
Note: there was no rain or debrey on the road. Next day I power my board on and all of sudden one motor cogs and stops. I got to thinking what I did wrong but I am 100% sure that I did nothing wrong in setting it up. I read tons of stuff from the forums so I had to be good on that part. First thought was to check the forums for a similar problem. Nothing. So I thought Since the motor is acting weird (smoke noise ratteling etc.) If i run the detection it should be good to go. So I ran the detection but it just wouldnt spin up and i new something is wrong. Changed vesc` s motor wires all that stuff to be 100% sure it the motor. Checked the wires and they are heatshrinked and there is no way that they could come in contact with each other. So then I thought maybe its the sensors. So ran a bldc detection sensorless. And then this happened. [https://ufile.io/rt40i ](https://ufile.io/rt40i)

Note: I have no idea how I could share this video so I made a link to a site where i can upload it its called https://uploadfiles.io/. Hope you guys dont mind.

Just to be sure that there isn't any physical damage to the motor, you can spin it around with your hand manually, right? No sounds or jamming when unpowered, right?

My final guess is that perhaps your battery is low and there's not enough power to run detection successfully. Then again, that wouldn't explain why the other motor works flawlessly. You could also try unplugging the sensor wires when running detection sensorless, see if that helps. I remember that my TB motors failed to detect in BLDC mode, so I'm running one in sensored FOC, and the other in unsensored FOC (because I'm stupid and fried the sensor :smiley: )

How do you guys stop your battery pack from getting destroyed due to undervoltage/over discharge when using shorted BMS?
Of course you can set ESC to stop at x voltage of entire pack but what if there's a weak P section?

If there is a weak parallel you should get it fixed or fix it yourself if you have the skills. By shorted BMS do you mean charge only? Just select that voltage on the vesc so it shuts down before it over discharge.

Check your pack when you first assemble it into your board, both at full charge and at partial to make sure  all your P groups are balanced. 

Check it again every time you do maintenance on your board, such as changing belts, wheels, cleaning/lubing/inspecting/replacing bearings, etc.

Don't treat your equipment as a black box, and be proactive in checking for signs of distress before you have a more catastrophic failure.

Since you don't have a BMS that can stop you from damaging your pack, the burden is on you to keep an eye on it. That's the disadvantage of running bypassed - you have to pay more attention.

Guys, I got this Tacon 160 Bigfoot courtesy of @Hummie but it came with disassembled shaft and bearing (only one) a 698Z ball bearing made in Indonesia, manufactured by NSK (8mm x 19mm x 6mm); there is another bearing missing which seats inside at the end of the shaft between the shaft and the can. Seems this bearing has a smaller OD than the other 698Z bearing. Did anybody familiar with these motors could tell which type of missing bearing this is?

Brian, is hard to tell because that bearing seats inside a bearing well at the bottom of the can where the shaft touches (grabs) the can. The ID is the same as the other bearing: 8mm but the question is the OD which is difficult to tell... lets see, I'm opening the motor right now... OD measure is 16mm !
```

---
## \#4890 Posted by: pixelsilva Posted at: 2019-03-04T09:19:07.996Z Reads: 76

So is 8mm x 16mm but the bearing thickness is unknown, the well is deeper than the other bearing seat (??) There is a conical ring that protrudes from the can's inside pressing towards the bearing seat (where this missing bearing is positioned) on the stator armature.

@onloop mentioned the other day his 6355 R-Specs had ZZ bearings (I don't remember the complete item number) he also confirmed his R-Specs were built in the same chinese factory that manufactured the Tacon motors, so is quite possible his motors and the Tacons share the same bearings, but is not a sure thing (??)

@Arek I have the second one @Andy87 mentioned, using it for an ebike. It's very good so far - Haven't run it yet, but I've wired it up and connected it to my phone. The app that they supply is crap, and doesn't work at all for me. Find the "VBMS" app in the app store (I have it on android, and it's available for apple too I think - not sure) for $6.99, which is totally worth it.

Could someone help me diagnose why one of my motors is stuttering when coasting? (No throttle, down hill).  I am using master/slave dual focbox, dual bkb 6374 190kv (running one FOC sensored and the other FOC uncensored) , bkb 11s3p 30q, ackmaniac software and BT app.  Here are some pictures, first one is the realtime data of the actual stutter, and the other is my settings.![Screenshot_20190304-124655|243x500](upload://4XJxn4alnIZD3c6Q28kyYGpsS7o.jpeg)

So I am back with the motor problem. I just updated the VESC tool to the newest version. Did the new FOC detection and then got this message when doing the detection. Then I got this result:
![20190304_202155|374x500](upload://jNgy1OrFZ8Zzq4t8326y1kZS8f2.jpeg) 

Then I switched connection between VESC`s. I did this because I saw that the 2 motors acted different in the detection. The result was also weird since both motors were wired up and the wires were intact and functioning.  So I did a new detection with the other VESC connected. Then I got this result:

Flux linkage detection failed

Hopefully you guys can help me and maybe recognize this fault. I already reported this back to Torqueboards, and I am currently waiting on their response.

What do you mean by acted differently and switched connections between vesc? Were you doing motor config on one vesc and then switch to the other?

Might not make any difference but your vesc ID is 39 and 98 normally they are 0 and 1

Earlier in this thread I send a video where you could se a motor moving forward and backwards in a random order. This time the motor detection went quite similar to this. Normally you hear a big buzz in FOC then the motor will spin up and then it will spin slowly when its detecting the poles (I think thats what it does). This time I heard quite a silent buzz but that's nothing to worry about. But it spun up quite some time after the other motor spun up. And it didn't do the slowly turning detection back and forwards. So that was concerning to me.

About the first question you asked. Yes First I did the detection on one vesc. But the new VESC tool can do 2 defections at once. I first connected it to my main VESC with the metr module and remote. After having done the detection there I switched to the other VESC and did the detection there.

Thank you for your reply! I looked into that, but it looks like it's the other way around.

The [25R's](https://www.nkon.nl/rechargeable/18650-size/samsung-18650-inr18650-25r.html) I'm using looks to be 20A instead of 15A for the [30q's](https://www.nkon.nl/rechargeable/18650-size/samsung-inr-18650-30q-3000mah.html). But the capacity of the 25R's are a lot lower with 2500 vs 3000 mAh. If I want to get both I have to upgrade to a [VTC6](https://www.nkon.nl/rechargeable/18650-size/sony-us18650vtc6.html), which comes down to 100,- more. I did just spot [this VTC5A](https://www.nkon.nl/rechargeable/18650-size/sony-us18650vtc5a-flat-top.html) on sale which is even cheaper than the 25R's, is that worth it?

The only thing I was worried about was the amperage it could deliver. After a quick piece of napkin math I think it's fine, but I'm not sure. Is my calculation correct?

Max battery amps = Cell max * Cells in serie = 15 * 12 = 180A
FoxBox Unity = 160A sustained, 300A peak, so thats fine.
BMS bypass, so that does not come into play.
Max motor pull = amount of motors * max motor current = 2 * 85 = 165A
180A > 165A, meaning the battery does not bottleneck

@Mich21050 Where did you get the 30q's with 20A discharge? I can't find it. Or is this the practical limit?

@venom121212 Allright, that explains why they are not being used, thanks!

@briman05 Thanks for the suggestion, but the HG2's are too expensive, and if my math checks out I can't even make use of the extra amperage, I'll probably stick the the 30q's then.

[/quote]

Nope! Max battery amps are amps per cell * cells in parallel. Putting cells in series increases voltage, which lets your motor spin faster = higher top speed.

Also, at low speeds your ESC will convert the high voltage of your battery to lower voltage, and because the watts will be the same (ignoring small losses), at those low voltages you can still get a lot of motor current. Only thing impacting your startup acceleration will be the size of your motors. Max battery amps will determine how long / till what speed you can maintain that current for the acceleration.

P.S. It's perfectly fine for the battery to be the bottleneck of the theoretical limits of the system. :smiley:

I'm using a push board (90mm wheels/180mm RKP trucks/27"(12" wheelbase) nickel board deck) and it's not stable, should I get a 30" or 32"?

I'd imagine motor power makes it harder to balance than pushing because speed

A good set of bushings can definitely change the way the board feels Paris trucks for some reason don’t work great with everything. If you look on Riptide’s website there is a chart that shows what works with every set trucks.

I'm a little cautious about pulling dimensions off models that were designed for 3d printing as quite often they are adjusted for material shrinkage and if you hit the exact dimensions off the print they don't fit...

can someone may tell me how to measure the battery 2x lipos in series right? Put + to + and starting down the pins? Sadly not often used a multimeter before. Also whats B0, B1 andso. The pins of the balance wires? Does the first pin of the second balance cable of the the second lipo get B0 again? if it is correct.

To measure voltage of the packs in series, you connect them in series.

Multimeter negative probe goes to battery no. 1 –
Battery no. 1 + connects to battery no. 2 –
battery no. 2 + connects to the multimeter's positive probe.

Imho, you might want to learn a few basic things about electrical circuits before you do this kind of stuff, or, ask someone for help and follow their diagrams very closely :smiley:

As for B0 and B1 – those do sound like pins of balance wires, and B0 is usually same voltage as the battery's negative terminal. (Depends on amount of balance wires VS cell count in the Lipo.) I'm not sure exactly what you're asking, but pictures would help :slight_smile:

Edit: Seems like @b264 is already helping you in another thread. Cool. :+1:

I knew already what you said but I dont really know where to start at the pins of the balance wires because I have to be sure for the bms its the correct cell, because they are in series I get same. voltages at some but I think. thats ok? 😅 just need to doublecheck everything and even asking stupid questions just to save money haha

Ok guys no see. Its not the problem with the multimeter Iam. measuruning the voltages but I saw several pictures and video because the battery is at the + side I have to connect the first red small wire from the lipo to pin 12 at the bms. But that makes ni sence because 12 has to be 44v.

Here are some pictures how I measured please someone help me Ill pay ice cream for everyone when me meet someday haha. 

![IMG_20190306_103130|666x500](upload://wdBIIhicvrKrsDUblViaVqxIwUt.jpeg)

Picuture 1 - Measured starting from the second pin (first pin is 0 because its the same) and thats arround 3.8v. to put my 11 or 12 cable from bms there makes no sense for me but Iam thinking about that "rule" and picutres I saw with the positive side and pin 12 the whole time. Like they say everywhere. 


![IMG_20190306_103149|666x500](upload://rwA2Vxt5LmJpHTq2dKAxYCNTsG5.jpeg)

Picutre 2 - Voltage raises up

![IMG_20190306_103102|666x500](upload://lJNct0OszYd7eahoILAlWgE8RdA.jpeg) 

Picture 3 - Voltage of last pin arround 22v

![IMG_20190306_102621|666x500](upload://4P0yuRr74NETFG7eDSPv1lQu4H9.jpeg) 

Picture 4 - First Pin has same voltage like the last one. Than it raises up again to 44v

Where do. I put this bms cables its somehow the other way arround now and two cables have to be skipped somewhere 😭😭

The balance wires on lipo batteries always have N+1 wires, with N being the number of cells. For a 6s lipo, that means you have 7 wires - One that goes to negative, (same as the big black wire), one that goes to positive (same as the big red wire) and one between each cell. 

Since you have the positive of the first pack connected to the negative of the second pack, then the last pin of pack1 and the first pin of pack2 are also connected together. This is fine, when you are making up your BMS balance pigtail, just use only one of these wires and ignore the other, then keep counting like normal. It makes zero difference which of the two you use or ignore. You will have a total of 13 wires: one negative, one positive, and one in between each cell. On your specific BMS, the first wire (0v, negative) is not used since it's the same as B-. This leaves the remaining twelve wires (from 3.7 to 44.4 measuring from ground) to go to pins 1 through 12 on your BMS.

A solid single drive will definitely climb a hill for you, and you will always have the option of upgrading to a dual drive in the future. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhujoQWA1CQ) you can see that a single 6355 at 55 amps handles everything up to a 20+% grade. Also keep in mind that your hill climbing performance is related to your gearing - If you gear for a lower top speed, you can climb hills better.

How bad is it to mount the batteries and ESC above the rear trucks?  Putting a sketchy 10s2p w/ BMS and dual ESC in a plastic Tupperware container with some foam insulation, and bolting it with the rear trucks hardware directly to the deck, maybe a rubber pad in between.

It's a drop deck and I have short legs so I can't easily put in underneath like usual or on top like a mountain board

No not at all.  Just make sure you tin entirely the wire and fill the cup before trying.  Don't try to bend the cable in and out.  Solder the end straight to the pre filled connector at 90 degrees.  All good brother.

None, but for motor shafts without one, you can make a small notch and put the set screw into it. If you have a motor with a keyway, you can put the set screw into it as well ofc. In high torque applications i recommend threading 1 more 3mm hole into the pulley right above or below on the existing holes. This way you have 2 screws going into 1 keyway. On my mtb build i did this with a 15t pulley on a 6384 motor and i havnt had a single issue

Hello sorry I have so many questions and I have not found the answers I have the Unity with 3.5mm bullet connectors and my motor has 4.0mm bullet connectors I have found a connector from 3.5 male to 4.0mm female but I do not know if this works I can not solder myself see the pictures and I have still found voltage meter but I see that without connection what I need to connect to the Unity thanks for helping.![chrome|250x500](upload://6CSU13AV68PJQsehe76T3nZ4iWA.png) ![aliexpresshd|250x500](upload://cLVXh1qlsDDVimShBNpqmWgpFYo.jpeg) ![aliexpresshd|250x500](upload://6GEG875GFZjMwTLIav20bMoW90J.jpeg)

If you can't solder, things will be hard for you in this field.

That first link will work for motor to unity connection if what you said of your motors is true. I would put heat shrink around it and seal it for strength.

Battery meter needs to be hooked up to battery positive and negative somewhere in your circuit. Again, without soldering, it will be more difficult. You would need to crimp terminals to the wires and make a connector to include your battery. This will probably require soldering wires too for flexibility.

Long story short, learn to solder. Irons are cheap and you will gain 1500 exp.

For the battery meter display you will need to solder atleast part of it because there is no way connect it to a source that would provide this info without soldering. You will have to learn to solder. You don’t have to be good at soldering but you need to atleast be able to solder some wires together or atleast know someone who can.

Look in the "Maximum amps for chassis wiring" column and remember that's continuous and for slightly longer runs of wire than we use in a tiny esk8, so we can exceed that by a bit, but I wouldn't go too far over that.  I personally don't exceed those numbers at all on the battery side and exceed them no more than 100% on the motor phase wire side

https://www.powerstream.com/Wire_Size.htm

So for example 12AWG is good for 41A battery current and 82A motor current  (the way I do it)

Speaking of batteries, is there any reason to not wire a pack like this?  I'm trying to get the most space out of the deck because I have a LOT of other crap I need room for.  Gonna use the solder tags provided by NKON and 10 awg silicone wire where the purple is (gonna strip the middles of the wire so each line is actually a single piece of wire)

If I fold the wires to sit in groves in the deck and only double fish paper insulation at the ends of the cells with them butted end to end, I'm thinking the pack will be 204mm wide and 288mm long

![Battery%20layout|451x355](upload://fiiY26bArJ59rwAqHXwRiFFyolA.png)

I realized I still have a shit ton to do so I'll wait the month for the cells to be tagged correctly and only spend like $30 for tags and $20 for the tape/paper/wires/wrap instead of buying a spot welder, unless anyone knows someone in the US who can tag them for less

Less than half second or else you're at risk dude. 

I guess you didn't really say what temps you're running the iron at, what tip you're using, and how good your technique is regarding your heat transfer skills (aka are you wetting your tip properly and keeping it clean of oxidation) 

But in short, soldering is surprisingly hard for what it is and I think you need a lot more practice before you mess with li-ion batteries that are going to be living in your house.

Yes, use the highest temp (850F / 455C)

It's counter-intuitive, but the highest temp iron is how you keep the cells the coolest

Making your own is somewhat simple imo.

Scrap a microwave. Shouldn't be hard to find one on Craigslist or something. Take the transformer. Do not touch the magnetron. Youtube is an easy way to see how to safely do this procedure.

Get some quality 4AWG (6 or 8 would also probably work) welding wire. Electron Beam Technology in the USA has AMAZING deals monthly.

Buy the Arduino kit to go with the microwave transformer. Then stealthily borrow your parents or neighbors car battery.

Buy some copper butt connectors shove them in the welding wire, properly connect them after tapping a hole for a set screw, insert probes, and ya got yerself a Gucci spot-welder.

I realize this kinda sounds like bullshit for the noob thread... But it's all actually pretty easy and all on YouTube quite a few times. Honestly, the most expensive part of you don't have an easy way to get it around you will be the electrode holder option.

So I finished making my second board for a friend everything was great until he plugged in the charger into the the anti spark key slot instead of the charger spot (both were xt 90 connectors). I think he may have fried the vesc because when all three phase wires are plugged into the vesc the motor becomes hard to turn but when the wires are unplugged the motor spins freely. Also when he plugged in the antispark key in its correct slot after what he did after a few seconds it heated up and started smoking. I now have the board and am not sure how to move forward and what test to do to find the problem. Also the BMS looks fine there are no visible spots where the plastic around it melted or anything like that.

Ok first, never make ports with different specs the same type of connector!

Now how to go forward I whould suggest

* Disconect the BMS (may be fried)
* Check your battery voltages
* Connect only the battery and the VESC and see if it boots up normally (make sure nothing heats up)
* Try the VESC with your motor
* Test only your BMS connected to your battery

I'd insure it for the exact size of the check you want to receive if it's lost.  Who cares what the value of it is.  What size check do you need if it never arrives?  Usually I say the actual value of the thing plus about 20%

(To be clear, I didn't sneak it through, I went with the battery in hand to their kiosk desk and asked how to send it...still dubbed.)

Packages are handled VERY rough in-transit and they ***WILL*** be thrown, and there isn't anything you can do to stop that.  They know that, that's why they act that way.  They don't think it will be packaged well enough.

I have 2x 6s 12000mAh batterys [Lipo]. Constant discharge 12c and max discharge 24c.

I connected them in series and rode 20km.

If i plug one of the batteries into my charger it says ~26%. But if i connect my new batterymeter it says 53%.
Shouldn't all be either 26% or 53%?
[The Image of the charger charged for a bit so its not 26% anymore]

I'm new here, so hi to all !

My problematic setup:
I have 3x3(9S) LiPo Batteries (Zippy 40C 6,2A) and a 10s bms bypassed for charge only.
My BMS starts with B- and then B1 up to B10.
This is my BMS: www.amazon.de/dp/B07CMB83RN/ref=psdc_1626845031_t4_B07G2CSMHD
I didn't connect B10 as I have 9 cells.
My Batteries have 4 Balancing wires for negative,Cell 1 to 2, Cell 2 to 3 and positive.
VESC 4.12 and 230kv 3KW 6374 motor by the way

Now my question:
Which of the balancing wires shouldn't I connect to the BMS ? is it the positive or the negative wire from the Batteries. Where do I start ?
This confuses me as there are posts which say different things. ?

Second question:
Am I able to use Regenerative Braking with the bypassed BMS without destroying my Batteries, because I could potentially overcharge single cells while breaking downhill ?

Thanks in advance !

You should not use a 10s bms for a 9s pack it is made for a 10s battery so you need a 10s battery.
```

---
## \#5101 Posted by: MysticalDork Posted at: 2019-03-14T04:36:36.930Z Reads: 76

```
Two things: First, you can't use a 10s BMS for a 9s battery unless is **specifically** says it can do multiple different cell numbers (Hint- most cheap ones can't.) 

Second, you would remove the fourth wire on the first two sets of balance leads - That is, if you have ground, 1-2, 2-3 and positive on each pack, then your arrangement should be ground, 1-2, 2-3, then ground from pack 2, then 1-2 from pack 2, 2-3 from pack 2, then ground from pack 3, and so on, ending with the positive from pack 3, for a total of 10 wires.

second question: Yes, but. You can still use regen braking, but just set your current limits at safe and sane levels (max regen of -12A or so) and don't try to go down a long or steep hill when your cells are at or near 100%.
```

## \#5102 Posted by: MysticalDork Posted at: 2019-03-14T04:43:30.385Z Reads: 77

```
So, do both batteries show the same reading on each device? As in, If you plug pack 1 into the charger and get 26%, and then plug pack 2 into the charger, is it also 26%?

If the answer is yes they are the same, then the difference is your charger and meter have different settings for the cutoff voltage used to calculate state of charge. The meter is probably calibrated for li-ion, in which "empty" is at between 2.5 and 3 volts, whereas your charger is calibrated for li-po, where the "empty" voltage is more like 3.7 or 3.5. This leads to a shifting of the apparent state of charge.

I'd recommend not running those cells down below ~30% on the battery meter, since that would be getting close to ~3.7v. (You can experiment and figure out exactly what percentage on the meter corresponds with 0% on the charger if you want.)

That was my exact same thoughts.

I have an eye on this 60A BMS:
www.aliexpress.com/item/10S-36V-Lithium-Battery-Protection-Board-BMS-with-Balance-Waterproof-18650-Lipo-Li-ion-16A-25A/32950961252.html
I contacted this seller regarding my 9S-10S problem and he answered this:"You can just order  10S 60A same port.  
the wiring of 9S is connect 10th and 11th red small wires together to B+"
So with this I'll be able to crank up the regen breaking power if I don't bypass the BMS right ?
Also should I get a BMS with combined port or seperate Port ?
Whats the difference anyway ?

I have an IMax Charger and I already drove a few times and charged my board with it...so that works. But I fried a Cell as I tried to charge with my BMS board.
Could probably be the wrong balance wireing...I'll check as soon as I get home.
Nevertheless I like the Idea to have my Battery balanced all the time and just plug it to a charger without opening the battery compartment.
I also know Bestech from this forum.
So I would go ahead and buy this http://www.bestechpower.com/333v9spcmbmspcbforli-ionli-polymerbatterypack/PCB-D345.html as its a bit smaller, But how/where can i order it ?

If I've got a bms with a common charging and load negative wire like this:
![image|690x290](upload://vuyrzbC7139zyJtT2uMIpXNO2Fa.png) 
Will there be any problems? Most bms's I've seen have the negative charging wire on a 
separate terminal and I'm guessing there's a reason for that.

For the record, I'm not wiring up my own battery by myself.
I obviously don't know how to do that and i know that batteries can be very dangerous so I'm not even going to attempt that.

I'm just trying to find a reasonably priced bms that's available locally for my battery guy to use.

When you said you tried to edit the appearance, that's the part appearance right? Like how you also would edit color, texture, etc?

The visualization setting should be elsewhere, and superscedes any appearance settings. It allows you to view normally, as a wireframe, wireframe with ghosted background lines, and wireframe with no background lines.

I did but I almost always have to "tap" the imperial nuts first before I screw it in all the way. This is regardless whether I've used them before or not. I don't think it has the correct pitch for the m5s. I've stripped a few nuts from this. I'm probably doing something wrong.

The 10-32  nut fits with a very tight tolerance on the M5 bolt. The other way around is loose and should not be used as you said.
The pitch is almost identical 0.8mm vs 32tpi/25.4=0.7935mm
The best way is to first use an M5 tap on the 10-32 nuts to avoid seizing.

Why are you saying that? As I showed the pitch is the same and if you check the same goes for the minor and major diameters. The small differences are taken care off with the use of a tap. It is not magic.

The receiver is typically PWM which VESC calls PPM, UART would be, for example, the bluetooth.  There are UART controllers but most are PWM.

Selecting PPM+UART means an RC controller will work and you can also plug in a bluetooth module if you ever want to.

These schematics do not make sense, Also it is said in the guide:
**Vesc Setup:**

* In App Configuration, set App to use to “UART”.
* Make sure to set UART Baud rate to 115200
* In Nunchuk tab, set Control mode to Current with reverse.

But I only get pick Current, or Current no reverse in the nunchuk tab.

Hi, I have built a electric longboard. I used it one summer but I wanted to upgrade. It was a hazel to unplug the battery's every time and plug them in to the balance charger.

Therefore I decided to add a BMS, 3 pin charge port and a small battery presenting indicator for easy use.. I decided to bypass BMS. I started with wiring the cables like the picture below, but forgot plug in the motor ore the balance wires to the battery's(I did not plug in the XT-90). When I plugged inn my charger the BMS became super hot(to hot to touch). I though it was because my battery balance leads were not plugged inn. Therefore I plugged in my balance leads and tried again. This time the 3 pin charge port and the charger welded together. Then I plugged in the XT-90 to complete the main circuit. This was a bad decision on my behalf, because the battery's started to expand, my cables and connecters started to smoke, and the VESC MOSFETs melted through the heat shrink. This lead to all my electronics getting destroid. :-(

I believe the wiring is the problem. I did not have the motor plugged inn. Can this have an effect on what happened.

Can anyone please take a look at my wiring an tell me what I have done wrong. Thanks ;-)

Using a higher rating than you need is always better electrically, but usually not as good when it comes to cost/size/weight.  So it's all about balance and engineering your specific build to be like you want.  Do you want it to be cheaper and/or smaller/ligher or do you want it to be more reliable?

Yes, but you'd have to change all the motor settings in vesc tool each time. It's doable and you can save both profiles as XML files so you don't have to manually enter them each time, but you'll still have to plug the ESCs int your computer and change files each time.

Do not use that charger.  You have to exactly match the charger and the battery.  Doing otherwise can be a fire risk.

Also that particular charger won't get your battery past 15% full even if it would work.

Yes.  You can also get softer wheels and/or wider wheels.  Turning up the "motor max" minimum current until it doesn't slip anymore, then turning it back down just a little, so you can barely make it slip, is what I recommend

Hi everyone, I've made a lot of changes to my 'to buy' list since last time I asked to check it. I got a smaller board, which meant I had to go from a 12s4p to a 10s4p (but getting portability in return). I also changed the motor, it's now a direct drive from [this group buy](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/2nd-round-mad-hubs-group-buy-mad-fury-direct-drive-conversion-kit-eu-us-ends-on-31-03-19/86850). I also added a lot of smaller stuff I'll missed, so I think it should be complete now. 

Can any you check [my list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CW0cA6nklLRdik3dFTN_YqdWGuwIcsWVDxPa487nLoc/edit#gid=1873928975) for any errors? Incompatible items, _x_ is better, that kind of stuff.

Hi! I checked fast but seems ok. The motor price is in Euro never mention $ :wink:
Of a short board and you want to use such big wheels like 107 abec I would think about a 12s3p battery instead of 10s4p for the extra power. Unity is pretty good in handling 12s.
Plis for the moment the kit comes with kegel adapter no abec but that can be changed no problem. I would look for 100mm BOA wheels, which are kegel core and still big. In the MAD Fury thread in the first post is the second rending with red wheels. These are BOA 100mm

Because it's a 42V 2A charger...it actually weighs less than the LED block on the front so it's hardly an issue

Also the enclosure is a duct tape wrapped cardboard box so it's easier to have the wires internal with the voltage step block stuck to the side of the enclosure, I just have the AC cord disconnected in my pack because it has that 8 shaped reversible plug

No; I have been running a Mini Remote on 4.2V lithium-ion for years now.

However, I might add I've only ever recharged it once despite using it daily.  Putting that much juice into this remote means it lasts so long you almost don't even need a charge port :stuck_out_tongue:

It has two big pockets where everything would have to fit in. It barely fits a glued 5p pack in the width (I'm looking into not using cell holders so I can make it a 10s5p). If you build a 10s battery you'll have 5 packs in both pockets, with 2x +/- 15cm left for your VESC, BMS, receiver and other stuff. If you go with a 12s3p system you gain space in the width of the pockets, but loose in length. the space in the width is about 24mm iirc, so it's not doable to put your VESC in there. I'm open for ideas if you see a solution!

> Plis for the moment the kit comes with kegel adapter no abec but that can be changed no problem. I would look for 100mm BOA wheels

They are currently nowhere in stock, I'll be on the lookout. If they are not back in stock before I want to ordere then [these wheels](https:///collections/longboard-wheels/products/97mm-flywheels-black) should also work right?

Where do you live? I have seen red boa somewhere. Anyhow the wheels you posted are abec core. You have to see the internal core. Kegel or abec. Now day mpst of the people want kegel, but I am also using abec. We can make the adapter for both no problem.
For Abec I would look into abec 97 mm s black superfly. 

12s3p is smaller in size than 10s4p it will fit no problem in the deck, don't worry :wink:  I am using 12s3p with 30Q and with this motor is giving me 25km at least. I don't know how much range you need.

 If you have a straight 22km 12s3p cna probably do it if you don't use it at 100% speed all the time but I do not like to discharge so much the battery so maybe 4p is better. Are you sure can not fit at least 11s4p in the deck? it has pretty big grooves. If I have time I could model it or maybe just try it in power point to put cells with the right size in the chamber (measures are published on the thread) and we can see it. If you use unity that is dua and small, no need of antispark because included. Small charge only bms like Bestech D140 (good one) should be totally feasible. To me also 12s4p. 
What you say about the layout it's only because you didn't try to draw it. If you have different number of cells in one chamber compare the other doesn;t make any difference. I also do like that. You can check my integrated deck (Bullydeck is the name) I am making that use similar grooves in size and fits 12s4p with nese modules that takes more space. Maybe 12s4p is not possible but 11s4p is also worth it.

Hey there, very new here (to the point that I am still unable to start my own thread asking my questions haha), but then I saw this noob thread which is obviously perfect for me!

I've been searching and reading, but I'm hitting a few walls for a couple reasons - I'm in the UK (so 90% of what's here won't help me as the parts are US only), and I'm not really looking to build what the 'normal' e-board build seems to be. So I figured i'd just put up what I'm looking to do, and see if the end suggestion is either a specific DIY build config, or just buying a cheap pre-made! 

What I want is a stable platform (so probably longboard), but which would need to be able to handle the rough UK roads (so probably pnuemo tires). Top speed is NOT a goal, as I'm unlikely to ever need it. Much prefer longer range and stability and control over top speed. HOWEVER I would be taking it onto grass and maybe even onto beaches, so I guess torque is needed? 

Questions end up being - 
1) Longboard with tyres possible, or would I need to go for a mountain board? Is there issues with this? 
2) Would a dual-motor setup be needed for grass/beach usage? 
3) What kind of thing would you suggest for my needs? Would modifying a cheap pre-made be better, as top speed isn't a requirement? 

Hopefully you lovely people can give me some pointers on my somewhat weird setup. I'm going to carry on looking for recent UK based builds and see what others have done :slight_smile:

So I'm gonna be building a board soon. I am wondering how you guys attach all the electronics to the board. Do you attach them to the enclosures or to the board? How do you do it and why you do it that way? 
I have been thinking of using these sticky zip tie bases we use at work that are just amazing. They stick like nothing I have ever seen before and to a fresh, clean surface like my board I am sure they would hold up for everything but the battery. That baby is gonna be heavy. Even so If I did 3 rows of zip tie bases along the battery it might hold up but thats just my AV mind thinking. I need advice from experienced esk8 builders. I honestly think this is the most crucial part of the build.

Longboard with tires is definitely possible. You want a deck with plenty of clearance around the wheels, but they're not too hard to find. 

Dual-motor is really excellent for riding in areas with poor traction. Definitely recommend.

I'd build from scratch, but that's my favorite thing to do. I guess you could mod a premade, but the requirements of deck shape for tires and dual motors means you'll likely already have a pricey item before doing any modding.

I'm in the US, so I'm pretty useless about sources of parts. Good luck!

"Bad" has many meanings.  Depending on what you're optimizing for, it could be and it could not be.

I personally recommend getting P-packs prewelded from professional battery builders and then using those to build your battery without spotwelding at all.

VESC 6 Plus would be the choice if you want a reliable three shunt VESC.
The SIX Plus has three phase shunts and has self adjusting filters for accurate voltage and current readings, which are important to do the real time FOC calculations, driving the motor.
This means it delivers the power ultra smooth and linear to the throttle input.
ESC like the Focbox, VESC 4 based HW, Unity etc. feature a power stage similar to the VESC 4 Those ESCs measure the currents on two phases only and on the battery side, not the motor side.
This means that the currents can't be measured precisely enough for seamless FOC operation. In between 60 and 100% power, the ESC will respond non linear to the throttle input. In between 80 and 100% duty cycle, the power can jump from one level to another. Especially on high power off-road builds this is very noticeable.  MTBs can be very energy hungry and drawing a lot of Amps happens quite often. So the ESC and all connections should be capable and overrated. 

Why you want a three shunt ESC:

Were is the MOTORS for Dummies thread?

I understand most of the specs. But still have questions. 

https://alienpowersystem.com/product-category/brushless-motors/63mm/

Specifically looking at the 63mm motors. Like the differences between a 6374 & 6384 

I understand the numbering on them. 74mm and 84mm respectively are the motor lengths. 63mm width

Now the part I'm having issues with

I see the 6374 for example. all of them being 3200watts but the KV is different.

the same 6374 size motor comes in- 130, 170, 200, 300, 400, 550, etc,

help me here.- I'll read. And want to. 


Plan is - to build 5 boards with these components (my 4 children and myself to use to-and-from events and around town; we like speed, and would use off road occasionally)

12s6p (samsung 30q) or better cells?
FOCBOX Unity
6384s (or different  motors) x 2 because 12s
TB 218 trucks -> or other recommendations
110 urethane and a set of pneumatics for each board
Custom CF boards we are designing with internal cavity
15mm belts or a direct drive gear kit - not sure yet
gearing not 100% yet

Kv is RPM per volt, usually you want 170-190 range

The battery voltage, kv, belt ratio, and wheel diameter define the upper cap on your speed

@ZachTetra, @b264, @MysticalDork, @venom121212 -
\\

Much appreciated. I prefer to learn, in the end, everyone will look at me for answers and I don't like to be the odd man out in a room. I'm the one people come to for answers in our circles. Research is my thing 😁👨‍💻

 It would appear that the specific motor size I am looking from this vendor doesn't offer a 190    - Would the 200KV / 4000W 6384S or 170KV be preferred - I see the top speeds changing messing with figures in the calc.

I'm ~180lbs myself, 200lbs with gear

Are there any other USA distributers with interesting motors to look at or recommended \? Not apposed to  a larger motor setup. Maytech? Is there a sealed 6384S or am I going to have to epoxy these myself.

Typically you'd want the 170kv but all needs vary

Not even close. 16AWG is less than half the cross sectional area of 12AWG, and thus able to carry proportionally less current. 12AWG silicone wire is good for ~80A, where 16AWG is good for maybe ~30A.

Soo Guys I need some advice. I will describe my current situation first.
I am currently a proud owner of boosted board like build with a vanguard deck and dual 6374 board. It has loads of power. Going to describe how much further on in this post. It accelerates like jet. Rides like a Porsche. Got some sweet 107 wheels underneath it which feel awesome. I currently have 3 x 4S 10.000mah lipos in series. They are about 40 mm thick including enclosure. So loads of clearance. My current range is about +-28km`s with the 400wh. I currently charge with a balance charger the turnigy reaktor. That goes up to 6S but Since I have 4 cells my charge time is about half a day. Because my powersource is a simple hobby king power source of 15V 7A.

https://hobbyking.com/nl_nl/hobbyking-105w-15v-7a-switching-dc-power-supply-with-uk-plug.html. 
https://hobbyking.com/nl_nl/turnigy-reaktor-250w-10a-1-6s-balance-charger.html

But the thing is that my charger is 15V 7A and the fuse in my reaktor is rated to 6A. So the guys from hobbyking said that I can only charge my lipo`s one at a time with 3A. Is this correct? Just checking to be sure. That was a quick overview of my current situation now getting into the upgrade question.


I want more range or quicker charging!!! I currently feel that I am turning arround when I am about to explore the new roads around my house. +- 15km away. And I want to go further. I live in the Netherlands maybe worth mentioning. 

So I was thinking about realizing this and then I though the trampa`s have those eboosted like enclosures that go fully underneath the board. With the 18650`s or 21650`s. So I though why don't I adapt that technology and buy 2 6S or 3 4S lipos and make a new enclosure. Yes I will fit  :slight_smile:  tested it.  Then I will have 10.000mah 12S2P. But there is a slight issue with that. Which BMS do I buy for charging those cells? Upgrading to 12S2P is gonna take so many hours to charge with my balance charger. So I need to get a bms and charge in series instead of 1 at a time. Right? I can connect the bms for charging only since I will be checking the lipo`s every 4-5 rides for the right balance voltages. 

So if i got with the option of going with 12S2P batteries. Which BMS do i get? is there a bms for 12S2P charging to about 16-20A?

Option 2:

Getting a BMS and getting a new charger. So option 2 that was suggested was getting a charger so I can charge at 50.4V aka 12S and get them charged all at once. The bestech 140D was suggested and I will connect it so It will be a charging only BMS.

Option 3. Getting 2x 6S or 3 x 4S batteries and just swapping the batteries. And buying a good powersupply for my reaktor, so I can charge them up to 10A instead of 3A :joy: .  But even if I would charge at 8A my charging time would be around 8 hours. Normal charging would be around 11 hours. 

What do you guys think option 1, 2 or 3?

Votes:
1x option 2 and 3 combined

BMS doesn't care about P-count, only S-count.

First you need to know if you're going to be discharging through the BMS or if you'll use it for charge-only.

There are pros and cons to each way.  I think most folks including myself use the BMS for charge-only.

Out of my head I know there are bms like bestech bms.
I believe they run 60 amp continuous and peak even higher like 120 (you have to pay attention to bms cutoff amps or something I believe)

It costs around 50 euros but you have a switch in it too.

To put it into perspective:

If you're pulling 100 battery amps, it means you're accelerating faster than a sick muscle car roasting its back wheels.

Completely unnecessary.

Having an over-rated battery helps ameliorate sag and lengthen service lifetime, though.

Delivered from where?

When the same amount of watts is delivered from the **battery**, single drive has less friction and losses, and thus, more torque.

When the same amount of watts is delivered from the **wheels**, dual drive has more traction, and thus, more torque.

So if you would do a drag race dual would win given the boards have the same battery specs and vesc settings.

Also, should I get a bigger motor? I have 6364 Keda currently. But not using more than 1100 watts peak. The motor is rated for 2kw. The only advantage I see from getting bigger motor is it runs cooler. Or are there more

Here's a slightly odd question, which I would have assumed would have a simple answer but after learning a bunch of stuff lately about batteries and their effects on motors I'm left a little unsure. 

Basically, I have a few options for battery setups, but mostly they leave me with more speed than I need and less range than I would like. The obvious answer is to make more of them parallel instead of series, and that's an option up to a point (depending on which packs I buy, especially for LiPo). 

So the question is basically this. If I have a setup (say 10s4p) which gets me 20km/h and 15km of range, and I use the VESC to limit my top speed down to 15km/h instead, will this give me any benefits/drawbacks?

Don't worry about limiting the vesc. You shouldn't be going full throttle all the time anyway. Better to have the speed when you need it and just choose not to use it (i.e. ~80% throttle would be normal for you).

Better riding habits will help your battery mucho

Changing your battery setup from 12s5p to 10s6p (just picking ones with easy numbers) won't give you any extra range in and of itself because there are the same number of cells overall, and thus the same number of watt-hours. 

Going slower will increase your range, because aerodynamic drag increases with the square of your speed. This means you'll use four times as much power going 40MPH than you would going 20MPH (In an ideal world without other factors).

You could always just adjust your gearing to lower your top speed as well.

I'm pretty sure it's a 4-pin JST-PH (2.0mm pin pitch) If not, you can measure it and compare with the table [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JST_connector). If not PH, then it's most likely ZH (1.5mm pitch). 

Once you know exactly what pitch, you should be able to find either premade cables or precrimped wires and ends that you can assemble.

Not as long as the setscrew that is engaging the shaft (The one in the middle of the pulley) is on a flat and properly loctited. Can't tell from the photo.

Unrelated, but if you have the clearance for it, I recommend swapping those button-head screws for cap-head screws with washers. They've got a bigger hex drive which makes them a lot more resistant to stripping out.

@Bas1 I dunno about motor beta, but the cutoff settings are thus:

Cutoff start is when the controller starts to reduce power going to your motors. This is when the battery is almost dead.

Cutoff end is when the controller essentially stops delivering power to the motors completely. This is when your battery is all the way dead.

Doing it this way means the controller won't just stop abruptly when your battery gets low. Instead it'll gradually reduce power from the start voltage to the end voltage so you can limp home to recharge.
```

@Bas1 I just did some quick google-fu, and I'd guess the "motor beta" is for calibrating the motor thermistor for overheat protection.  See [this link](https://www.ametherm.com/thermistor/ntc-thermistor-beta). 

It's probably set from the factory for a standard 10K thermistor, but can be changed if you have a motor with a weird value instead. Helpful if your motor is "overheating" and going into protection without actually being as hot as the vesc thinks it is.

Hello there. I am currently looking for some motors for my first ever build. My question is whether i should go for unbranded motors or banded ones with nearly the same spec but ouble the price. 
Also should i go for an ESC like a flipsky 4.20 plus dual or something more powerful like a 6.6 dual or focbox unity.

@Michal 
If at all possible, go with something 6.x. The 4.x has design flaws that the cheap manufacturers (like flipsky) don't address.

For motors, brand is less important since there are no sensitive electronics inside, but better quality is always better. Maytech is well-liked, as are torqueboards and dickyho.
The cheap motors do work, but they usually don't last as long unless you "improve" them with loctite, better setscrews, and epoxy on the magnets, etc.

There are two ways shrink wrap is measured: Diameter, if it's sold as round tube, and width, if it's sold creased flat. For the same piece of tubing 100mm in diameter, if it's measured flat, it'll be 157mm.

Measure the circumference of your pack where the shrink will go, and then calculate the diameter needed to go around it and add ~20%. If you need the flat dimension instead of diameter, then multiply the number you got by 1.57.

Charge port fuse is NECESSARY to help prevent your pack from bursting into flames in the event of a charger malfunction. It can be built in to the battery but yes, it goes between charge port and BMS (typically on negative line)

The fuse between BMS and battery comes to cell level fusing which not many packs are doing at the moment. 

The fuse between battery pack and electronic speed controller (esc) is a bit different. This is an optional one and comes down to whether you trust your speed controller to be able to handle a voltage spike for a few seconds or not. Personally, I run un-fused in this regard because I trust my Unity esc to handle a larger power draw if I need it. I would rather not be thrown off my board at full speed and/or lose control when a fuse blows at the sacrifice of MAYBE one day blowing my esc.

Hi,
   I'm having a hard time determining the continuous and peak amp output of different battery systems.
   I'm interested in drawing 160 continuous amps (80amps/motor in a dual motor setup) I realize that this is way above normal usage.
   Is a battery pack built from 18650's capable of outputting this much continuously? Specifically I was told that Samsung 30Q's were able to, but I am not quite sure. In what form would the batteries have to be in to be able to output that amount of amps continuously? I was planning on using a 12S setup, 36-50.4Volts, and could go as large as 12S5P configuration.
   Or should I stick to Lithium polymer (Lipo) packs, and make sure that the "C" output is above my requirements?

   Thanks in advance.
```

First of all, the "C" numbers given by lipo manufacturers are, for lack of better words, complete bullshit.  So, you're reduced to guessing.

As far as Samsung 18650-30Q cells, they are rated at 15A continuous and it's widely known they are underrated and can do 20A continuous.  So you'd need at least 8P to get 160A.  If you want 50.4V then it'd have to be a 12S8P at a minimum which is huge and and heavy, using 96 cells.

If you need that much current you might need lipo or LiFePO4 depending on your other needs.

Thanks, I don’t think I can fit a 12S8P battery made from 18650 so that is out of the question for now.

I was kinda skeptical of the 50-65C values.

Do you know of a reliable way to test the output of batteries? I have some Lipo batteries and can start a database for others to reference if I can measure actual values.

I’ll have to research LiFePO4 batteries, I’ve never heard of them before.

LiFePO4 batteries can

* deliver higher current
* last longer
* operate in colder temperatures
* be more resilient to vibration

versus li-ion.  However, they are large and heavy for their capacity so a longer-range battery doesn't mix well with LiFePO4 because it will weigh a lot

Two of mine [are LiFePO4](https://forum./t/the-blue-one-12s-lifepo4-170kv-6374-caliber-2-30-43-powell-peralta-focbox/75)

Thanks, I'm okay with heavier as long as the output current is there. I'm not looking for longer range, and I'm fairly lightweight myself (~150lbs).
   I saw you have only 31amps output entered into your VESC settings, is your battery capable of more, you just limited it?

Do you want to draw 160 battery Amps or 160 motor Amps?
Those values are set separately in a programmable ESC. For instance I have set my continuous battery Amps to 50A and my dual motors to 50A each. So even if my battery sees only 50A my motors are drawing 100A on inclines.

Ah, yes, completely understand limiting the values for daily use.
I'm interested in peak performance for a very short amount of time in this build, and am okay risking overloading components.

I am quite new to programming vescs, so maybe I don't fully understand all of the pieces.
I would like each motor to draw 80amps, so that would be pulling 160 motor amps.
I assumed that if the motors were pulling 160amps, that the batteries would have to output 160amps (or slightly more)

For lipo you can trust the ratings on the turnigy graphenes.  They are a great battery.  Some lipo manufacturers inflate the discharge rating and don't actually state the tested continuous rate.  This can lead to problems when trying to calculate what they are capable of.  The graphenes are rated to their continuous discharge.  They do what they say they do.  Bit more expensive but they also have a longer charge/ discharge span too so even though they cost a bit more they are well worth it.

A couple things: Motor amps vs battery amps: At anything other than 100% load and 100% speed, the ESC acts as a buck converter. It converts excess battery voltage down and increases the output current accordingly. 

Two: What in the world are you going to be doing that could even come close to a continuous 80A per motor, other than accelerating up a 40% grade at 20+ MPH?

It's being built for a competition among peers. it will most likely never be used at anywhere near full output aside from the one day when demonstrating. (even then, if it is actually that fast, it may never actually reach full output other than on paper)

I used this bicycle calculator. http://www.u.arizona.edu/~sandiway/bike/climb.html

Even for a competition vehicle, you still don't need 80 battery amps per motor. 50 will be more than enough, even with 80 motor amps. It'll launch just as hard off the start (And thus be as difficult to stay on) either way. All adding more battery amps does is improve the acceleration falloff as you reach top-speed. Low-speed performance isn't affected.

You would still need to secure the loop key to the enclosure I used abs cement you cause also you jb weld you can also 3d print a panel mount for it.  After it is secured just solder the wires to the ends on the loop key.  As for the actual key there are several different ways people make the loop key.  @b264 solders on a multi layered braid and then conformal coats the braid.  @mmaner uses a single thick gauge copper wire and then uses a 3d printed cover to make it easier to pull on and off.

Pinging all you experienced battery builders: @barajabali @longhairedboy @psychotiller @hyperIon1 @hyperIon2     

I've heard nickel to nickel welds are tough. 

I was planning originally on layering 5 - 6 layers of nickel for a 175A total capable set of cells in 10S.

I did some test nickel to nickel welds... And they aren't nearly as strong as the welds to cells themselves. The nickel to cells leave a nice tiny hole on each spot weld when yanked off. 

The nickel to nickel welds, at full power, are strong-ish, but once I get it started I can basically peel it off as if it's medium strength Velcro, maybe less... And no holes or metal tearing when split apart. Is this just par for the course when it comes to nickel?

Should I just make sure it's on better by welding more spots on the nickel to to nickel sections (all only P-group connections)?

Or should I try maybe only one or two 0.15mm nickel strips and a soldered solid core copper wire across the P group with an 80-100W iron, pre-tinned nickel strip [may even pre-tin prior to spot welding it..?] and copper wire, and cooled with cool damp sponge in order to make the P group connections robust enough to deliver 75+A across a couple cells worth of what would have been layers of nickel?

Or maybe I'm missing an even better way to go about delivering high amps from one side of a P group to the other for terminating into a series connection wire or two... Bus bars/PCBs ontop of the cells won't work in this build.

Yes, you are correct any more than 3 layers and the welds don't hold well. Finding the sweet spot depends on what your demands are, and of course, there is not just one right way, in fact, several have emerged on the forum depending on your specific scenario. flat braided copper wire has been used if flex is needed and even solid copper bars, technics, and material quality play a hand.  You also have to keep in mind to much of a good thing is just that, too much. More material higher resistance, higher resistance more heat, and lost power.

I don't need much flex, but some.. and my nickel strip is only 8mm wide so I'll probably steer clear of copper braid. 

Thanks for the response, I don't know if I fully understand the resistance thing... I thought more material the better, but i haven't considered the added resistance of layers upon layers of nickel. Tell me if I'm on the right track: cell --> layer of nickel --> series connection = lower resistance than cell --> layer upon layer upon layer etc of nickel --> series connection... Hence the couple or so being a sweet spot.

I'm really leaning now towards solid copper bar, and 2 max layers of nickel. No longer considering 3 or more. I hadn't considered that the welds might even get worse after the first nickel on nickel layer...

I have seen them done 100 different ways. Im sure someone can do all the math behind it to substantiate it. Different cell types and what they can handle is a factor. The 30q work well with 2-3 layers of parallel and a double serial with nickel, copper adds a lot in braid or bar.  the bus bar PCBs work well because it is only 2oz thick copper bars

I just made a total noob mistake and wanted some advice. I mixed up my battery config in the esk8 calculator when selecting a gear ratio and already bought a chain drive train with a 4.2 ratio. I was planning 2 6s Lipo packs in series but mistyped it as a single 6s pack and it threw off my calculations. According to the calculator 6s would give me the speed I want with enough torque, but 12s would be twice as fast as I want, but also half the torque at the same gear ratio.


To me it seems like I have two options; use a 6s battery and keep the gear ratio as it is, or go 12s and change the gear ratio which will be more difficult since I would need to make a 72tooth or higher count sprocket to fit Superstar hubs since I can't find any online. Is there a disadvantage to doing the former with 6s if I keep the amperage under 80 with a focbox?

Does it sounds, unfortunately, familiar to someone ??
https://youtu.be/FyVb4_MUCuQ

When I push the trigger, the motors goes crazy cogging and screaming loudly ... :face_with_raised_eyebrow: never see that before.
All detection and paramter well set as before but with the new motors (detection foc sensored ok)  and drive system (GD, well set, turn well).

Thx a lot guys :v:

Hey all, so I'm currently having 'space issues' in my build, and it may result in me needing to stack some of my components (leading to a thick section of my enclosure :frowning:) 

The problem comes with my BMS (bestech 10s charge/discharge)  and my flipsky dual vesc. They don't quite fit next to each other, and my board is too short to have them behind each other. So I was wondering... can I stack them on top of each other? It might make the wiring much easier, but I'm slightly concerned by any heat problems... 

Although I know some battery packs have the bms inside the wrapping with the batteries, so I can only assume heat isn't a big problem for them?

It depends on the charger, if is only a 2a charger then heat should be fine but 10a might cook the ESC, if the BMS gets hotter than the ESC then that's risky territory otherwise it should be okayish

Recently read in a thread about the BMS balancing out cells after charging and staying quite warm for an extended period of time which isn't great for batteries (if cells are already pretty balanced maybe not a big issue).  If it were my build I'd go with BMS on the board and VESC just below it (looking at the board sitting on wheels from side view) so BMS heat goes into the board and upward away from the VESC (usually overheating hasn't been an issue for me either but I don't stress any of the equipment much being light and in a mostly flat land area)

So I read some more about my battery and found out mooch did a test on it.


https://www.e-cigarette-forum.com/threads/sanyo-ncr18650ga-10a-3300mah-18650-bench-retest-results-a-great-10a-battery.774493/

Turns out you can push these atleast to 10 amps each. 

Now I'm running 10s4p of these but can't seem to get more than 35 amps max. (very saggy when pulling this amount of amps).
My settings are 40 batt 

Why can't I pull more? is it the sag?

I assume you not a heavy guy 😅 on flat road you should get some good acceleration with it. With my mtb on flat i think i‘m usually don’t draw more than 1000watt per motor and i‘m about 85-90kg with gear on, so 750watt with urethane wheels should be fine or you have a problem with it?

I don't think so. Take a look at these two graphs: ![10A%20GA%20vs%2030Q|608x500](upload://9lOujPMOaA3ctoLemRSkVRQvUiY.png)  ![15A%20GA%20vs%2030Q|661x500](upload://qR6yhu64Y2lyIZQrX0KE6sy82k8.png)

While the GA does outperform other 3500mah cells like the 35E (See image below), it sags much worse than the venerable 30Q. Great for larger packs with high P-groups and low current per cell, but far from ideal for demanding high-drain applications.

[shitpost] few years ago I saw an eboard in my dreams with Beautiful royally dark zebrawood skateboard deck, 60mm 4WD hub motors, a very clean black battery box underneath and independent four wheel suspension just like this:  
![image|663x500](upload://elceIzsMaw7NiAkSxcYbFBjPj70.jpeg) 

 but much cleaner and a bit more bigger (or the wheel in the picture are too big?). It was a summer evening in some pub-bar pedestrian area in the city and the guy riding it did an ollie over like meter wide 'gravel' belt in the smooth granite pavement area and did a nice soft landing right in front of me. After that we went into the pub, laid our eboards next to a wall and had a beer or something. Trippy 

But I never thought this kinda independent suspension was possible on eboards tho, never seen those before. Just randomly saw this on google search 

Gotta love the elements of REM sleep :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

Irritatingly so. If you have a welder with wands or hand held welding probes, use a step weld instead of a parallel weld. And keep your positive lead in the ame place, on the metal below, and move the negative around on top of the metal above for multiple welds.

I did this on an old scooter with sla batteries in it. I had 3 batteries in series (36v) and then a huge toggle switch that would add in a 4th battery to make it 48v. The motor would get insanely hot and I had to have a 12v charger for the turbo pack separately from my 36v charger.

No idea on the vesc end just wanted to share with the class

The anti-spark blowing typically won't blow up your BMS.  Also whether you're discharging through the BMS or bypassing it (using it for charge-only) is a drastic difference.  An anti spark failing when you bypassed the BMS could possibly wreck your cells if you let them die but it still probably wouldn't break the BMS

Hi,

I'm deciding between a 10s and a 12s battery right now. The thing is is that if I go with the 12s I'll only have space for a 12s3p battery, against a 10s4p otherwise. this means I would go up in voltage, but loose in amperage and watts.

I get that higher voltage means higher top speed, and higher amperage means more torque. But what would it practically mean for this setup. It's a trade-off, but I don't know what would be the difference. What would be the practical difference between the two setups?
 [This is the battery I would use](https://eu.nkon.nl/sanyo-ncr20700b-lithium-battery.html). I would be running a custom [75kV direct drive motor](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/mad-fury-mad-hubs-direct-drive-conversion/83423).

For this motors I really advice 12s since you get both torque and speed over the 10s. Although the battery cells you chose are not that great in term of continuous current, so probably 10s4p is better. There is a particular reason why you want to use those cells instead of Samsung 30Q? If you want 12s3p with a lot of amp then buy VTC6 , but they are expensive.

With those cells, 4P is better than 3P.

40 cells is better than 36 cells.

Not sure what ESC you're using, but for most popular ESCs I recommend 10S as they are not using parts rated high enough (DRV8302 etc) to safely exceed 45V

Simple answer yes. And yes. To an extent you can mix some baseplates and hangers. Like you can put caliber hangers in Randal baseplates. And you can put Paris hangers in Randal baseplate a combo known as prandals. The reason why you should use genuine trucks is because generally the bushings and pivot cups suck.

I know, you advice that, but that does not help if it doesn't fit in there :P. I was under the impression that more amperage = more torque, but I guess that's not true? I tried to look for a thread which explained it, but I couldn't find any. I don't think I need that much speed, only torque as I would be using it in a city.

I'm constrained with the size of my board, which as a width of 91mm. With both types of cells I can fit 4 sideways, but the 18650 cells are slimmer. My cells are thicker, so I can fit more of them in the same space. I'm open to change if there is a better cell type to use.

I'll be using a Unity, which is high enough rated for 12s.

That was my question, those 4 cells give more wattage total, but have less voltage in that configuration. How would this impact the board IRL?

Sotty but I just drop it here because I think I already told you about it. I guess you will use the short Haya board. This picture is taken from @StefanMe, where he fits really easy 10s4p with modified NESE modules that take quite some space. I guess you are gonna use classical spot welding and you use a unity which is dual. To me you can fit a 12s4p battery in it, or for sure a 11s4p.
![image|375x500](upload://j8SoN2d4dD0FCOaAei9Ng5MCbhJ.jpeg)

EDIT: Took the HAYA grooves size and simulated a battery set up with 18650 cells, unity and BMS place next to it. 11s4p no problem. With a bit of fantasy 12s4p is also possible to me.

![HAYA%20short%20Test%20v2|690x388](upload://1lO5kLAoR6ETJHs2bGAwh2yiqbc.png)

12s4p. Not say that is worth it. 11s4p would be a great battery already and way easier to make it if it is your first time. If the BMS is a micro one then it will fit on one side against a wall and you can fit 12s4p with a normal configuration.

@ryansinatra That screw actually doesn't look completely rounded out. I'd recommend getting a T20 torx bit (They're like $1 at most big-box stores) and gently hammer it into the screw. (It might even fit without hammering.) Then use a 1/4" driver of some sort on the torx bit.

After you've got it out, I'd recommend either
A: If you stay with stainless hardware, stay with torx screws, and use a torx driver. You'll twist the head off the screw before you strip it.
or
B: If you plan to use hex, go with high strength (grade 12.9) alloy steel screws rather than stainless, and use Wera hex-plus wrenches. They're the best ones out there, and are absolutely worth the money.

Packing things too tightly like your last photo means you don't have very much room to insulate things which means they can more easily fail from vibrations.  Always add a mm or two to things for fishpaper and insulation.

yeh I know that was just to show that you can do naive dispositions to reach your goal. I also said that 11s4p looks rather simple and plenty of power for a short board. Plus if he uses a micro BMS that can be place on the side of the unity and have all the space need it for a 12s4p with insulation ecc... Always add fishpaper, that is a must of course.
Although the board will be really heavy and short boards usually stay rather light, but that can not be avoid it with big batteries.

Hey guys, building my first belt driven build. Having some trouble with the motor cables and the mounts as seen on pictures. Do you think it's OK that the cables bend on top of the enclosure? I really want to have motors facing the front, any ideas?
Also enclosure might be a little higher because I am going to use rubber gasket. If I move any higher the mount I might have clearence problems...

I'd rotate the motor 90 degrees (so the wires are pointing at the trucks) so the wires aren't at risk of being pinched between the motor/mount and the deck/enclosure.

Since it's over 300WH, I think you're kind of stuck. According to UPS and the other shipping providers I checked, 

"Shipping of lithium ion cells >60 WH and batteries >300 WH and lithium metal cells >5 grams
lithium per cell and >25 grams per battery as fully regulated Class 9 hazardous materials.

• This includes Class 9 batteries that are “packed with” and “contained in” equipment. There is no
general relief for larger batteries.

• There is a Class 9 Miscellaneous label that was developed specifically for lithium battery shipments."

You need a [hazardous materials shipping contract.](https://www.ups.com/assets/resources/media/hazmat_contract.pdf)

Many people ship large batteries labeled as being below the 300WH limit and get away with it, but you always run the risk of it being confiscated, or you being fined for shipping mislabeled hazardous goods.

I've seen several builders on here make "shipping friendly" multi-part battery packs, with each part being within the shipping regulations and classified as an individual battery. In your case, splitting it in half would do the trick, but it'd be a pain to do that to an already-complete pack safely and cleanly.

Hi, So I'm wondering if there is a way to check battery health and voltages in cells, without completely dismantling a battery pack and using a multimeter? 

I know that DieBMS is an option, along with other smart BMS, but they tend to be either be expensive, insufficient to the job, or hard to get hold of. 

I plan to be using the Bestech 10s 80A charge/discharge BMS with eswitch, and was wondering if there was any way of adding some kind of monitoring functionality to it?

Ahh. So not as difficult as taking the battery packs apart, but still requires opening up the board and using a multimeter. 

Though if all it needs is the negative probe to be on the wire... and doesnt seem to even need the positive to be attached to anything at all... wouldn't it be relatively simple to add an in-line passthrough board before the bms who's only job is to read and transmit the voltages? I mean it would just have to be a multimeter that scans through all 10 inputs and does some very simple calculations and then transmits to an app every second or something. Surprised that's not already a thing.

Yeh but as I said, I haven't yet seen a smart BMS that isn't either very expensive, too low amperage for discharge, or just straight up isn't easily obtainable. 

Unless you mean there's a way of adding a smart BMS to a normal BMS, but I doubt that's the case. There should be a way to add the smart BMS features to any BMS.

The positive does need to be connected. Positive to the positive terminal of the cell you're measuring, negative to the negative. Or, alternatively, you can put the negative on the pack negative, and put the positive on each wire in succession afterwards and measure the increase. 

One of the main issues with building a "simple" battery monitoring doohickey with app support is the relatively high voltages it has to deal with, as well as quiescent current drain. You don't want your battery monitor to drain your battery, and you especially don't want it to drain it unevenly. Thus, you either have to have a very low quiescent current, or have a way to completely turn it off when not in use. The combination of high voltage and low quiescent current is a tough one, especially on a (preferably) small, simple, compact and cheap device.

Also, define "too expensive" regarding a smart BMS.

So I'm choosing lipo cells and had a question about battery amps compared to max motor amps. 

For example; a 6s 5ah 25c pack outputs 125 amps. The motor I'm using has a max of 65 amps. Since I'm only using one motor, 125 amps is far greater than the motor can take, so the question at hand is:

**Does it make sense to choose a lipo with a higher C rating like 30 or 40 if I wouldn't be able to use that much amps?** I didn't have to worry about this on my first build since my battery could only output 80 on a 2wd system. Thanks.

Question for San Diego riders:

Just got word today I've been accepted for an engineering internship position in San Diego. No easy way to bring my car coming from Ohio and I don't think I'll be having a company car haha. Right now, the only thing I'm waiting on for my build is a little bit more cash, however it's gonna look something like this

Unity
Dual Maytech 6374 170kv sealed
Surfrodz RKP or TKP
Haya Short Deck (???)

and here comes the question

TB 110 Wheels

Just found out those Mofuggas weigh about 5LB total. I have a wonked shoulder, so carrying that might be quite hard. At the same time, not really sure how much I may have to carry it...

Anyways... how necessary may TB110's be in San Diego? I've really been wanting them and was about to pull the trigger, but weight really does hurt me. Good idea or no?

What happens if a BMS lead is disconnected?  Does it just not balance that cell or does it try to and fuck up the pack?

You can't have unequal parallel strings. If you have three batteries in series and one in parallel with them, then the three batteries would just dump charge into the one until it explodes. If you want to keep your 12s setup and go from 1p to 2p, then you need a total of **six** packs. Three in series, plus another three in series next to the first three.

If you only have four batteries, the best you can do is 8s2p, which would be two in series, with two more in series next to the first two.

Keep in mind that going from a 12s1p to an 8s2p will only get you a 33% increase in range, and it will cost you 33% of your top speed as well. 

If you want double your range, you need double the batteries.

I'd be worried about two things: First, if the balance wires are loose, then the BMS can't balance those cells, which is bad. Second, if the BMS has zero voltage reading from some cells, it may just decide to shut down and you could streetface when your board quits mid-ride.

You should fix it ASAP.

I can't fix it until I get a new JST so should I just unplug the charger before it balances and leave the plugs out?

If you insist on using your board while the BMS is questionable, I'd recommend doing a complete balance check of all cells, making sure they're within 0.05v of eachother (And manually balancing them if not), and then completely disconnecting/bypassing the BMS, including discharge leads temporarily to remove any chance of streetface.

Hey! I need some reassurance in my decision in which motors + esc to buy. 
The esc (https://www.banggood.com/HGLRC-Flipsky-Dual-Belt-Drive-BLDC-5055-Brushless-Motor-Kit-for-DIY-Commuting-Electric-Skateboard-p-1378395.html?rmmds=search&ID=224&cur_warehouse=CN) 
- Voltage: 24V / 36V
- Current: 12A
- Maximum speed: 3000 rpm
- Maximum power: 290W (24V) / 430W (36V)

the motors (https://www.banggood.com/HGLRC-Flipsky-Dual-Belt-Drive-BLDC-5055-Brushless-Motor-Kit-for-DIY-Commuting-Electric-Skateboard-p-1378395.html?rmmds=search&ID=224&cur_warehouse=CN)
·Max power: 2400W,  Rated Power: 1200W
·Max current: 50A   ,   Rated Current: 25A
·Voltage: 24-36V

Where I am confused is that the motors are rated at a much higher wattage than the ESC is able to output. Now Im assuming the motors will simply not be running as high as they are able to but I might be wrong. The ampage also confuses me a bit, it seems to be rated way higher on the motors compared to the ESC. Once again, I am not sure if this will outright not work or something else. I am also unsure as to what would be a good choice of battery/batteries considering the ESC and motors could work together.

Sorry if I am asking about something really obvious but I could not find any clear info on the matter, any help is appreciated :3

Depends if you want a toy or a tool. Do you care if it only lasts a month before shit starts breaking? If you want a tool, and if you will be very sad if your shit breaks in a week, then you should save up and buy quality components from the get-go, because you'll save money in the long run compared to buying the cheapest, breaking it, then buying the right stuff the second time.

```

---
## \#5631 Posted by: MysticalDork Posted at: 2019-04-06T23:23:55.601Z Reads: 78

```
Belt drive is super common and well-tested in esk8, so parts specifically designed for esk8 are more available than chain. Belts are also quieter, and don't require any lubrication. Belts have smaller teeth than chain, so the pulleys can be smaller, and have a larger range of incremental sizes.

Chains can transmit more power, but unless you're pushing 5+ KW, I don't think that should factor into the choice. Chains are narrower, so if you're really hurting for a few extra mm of space, that can be a reason. Chains can be more resistant to fouling by snow or other material, which can get packed into a belt drive and break the belt.

Overall unless you have a specific reason to pick chain, I'd go with belt.

From my understanding, I won't gain any additional torque by increasing battery max from 40A to 80A, except when duty cycle is above 50% (motor amps set to 80A).

Is this true? Will 40A battery/80A motor really result in the same torque at low speeds as 80A battery/80A motor? 

It doesn't make sense in my experience, with motor amps set to 80A, every time I've increased battery max from 10A to 20A to 30A to 40A I feel like there is a significant increase in low speed torque. Maybe it's just placebo masked by additional higher speed torque?

## \#5636 Posted by: MysticalDork Posted at: 2019-04-07T20:36:34.465Z Reads: 77

```
That is my understanding, yes. Your mileage may vary, but based on all the info I've seen, changing the battery max (within reason) doesn't affect motor torque at low speed. For low battery current settings (10, 20, etc), the "low speed" regime that the battery current doesn't affect may be very small. It depends on a myriad of factors, including your battery voltage, motor KV, motor impedance/resistance, gearing, etc.

It's for ebikes rather than esk8, but the concepts are the same. You'll notice that the peak motor currents are the same, but the graph with the lower battery current begins to tail off before the other. Depending on the motor, controller and battery, the flat part of the blue graph may be very short, or very long.

That's a great graph, thanks!

 One thing that still gets me, and how it translates to real world riding feel, is that the overall power still increases up to the max battery amps. 

The fact that a pack that can output double the power of another pack and their torque remains the same is odd. At low speeds, it makes sense. My board feels strong, and it doesn't feel *as strong* at high speeds but I can still feel the *power*. If I were to double that, I just don't know what it feels like to have *double the power* (at higher speeds) but the same low speed torque. Basically, the low speed torque continues on into higher speeds I guess, and with equal battery/motor amps, you never feel a loss in torque across the entire range of capable speeds... Hmm... I can't wait to feel it.

I'd personally rather have 10Ah of 20C lipos than 5Ah of 40C lipos. Those C ratings are rarely accurate or rigorously standardized, and are mainly useful as an apples-to-apples relative comparison between the same brand, e.g. A zippy 5Ah 40C is almost certainly better than a zippy 5Ah 20C, but I highly doubt it's twice as good.

I don’t get wha put you mean with arms, do you mean stabilisers perhaps?

It’s better for you to first read through the forum, there’s of info.

What the guy is saying, basically is that you need 36t wheel pulley (this is the big thing mounted on your wheel to transfer the power)

12mm wide is the width, single drives uses 15mm but 12mm each for dual is fine.

15t motor pulleys is what you mount onto your motor (those small most likely aluminium thingys for your motors.

12mm wide belts 265m means a belt with wide of 12mm and a length of 265mm. You can calculate the exact belts lengt needed once you know certain dimensions. But if he says you need 265 he’s probably right

Yeah finding a decent 12s BMS was a lot harder than 10s or even 13s since so many ebikes use those. Here's a [12s BMS that I've used before](https://www.ebay.com/itm/Protected-Balance-Module-PCM-BMS-30A-for-12S-43-2v-44-4v-Li-ion-LiPo-battery-922/223004221886?ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT&_trksid=p2057872.m2749.l2648) in a previous build that I'm satisfied with.

Is this right? I can't remember where I read it but is it possible that the VESC can upscale the current when PWM is less than 100%. For example the PWM to the motor is 50% and the battery is outputting 60A, would the current to the motor (without any limitations in place) be 120A? (similar to how a transformer works)

Also I saw a build where the battery pack is 2500W and there are two motors which combined are 7000W. It seems like a lot of wasted potential from the motors. Is there a ratio for what works best that I can use to select a lower power motor?

bat amps not motor amps.
you can draw 10A from the battery and your motors get 20A for example. 

But as input power is (more or less) output power your voltage on the motors will drop.

Regarding Vesc tool and regenerative braking:

The standard value for maximum input voltage value in the vesc tool is set to 57V, does this mean if I do regenerative braking the Vesc produces up to 57V and supplies the battery (in my case 10s) with that? How does this not damage the 10s battery (max. voltage is 42V)? Isn't that triggering internal shorts due to overvoltage?

Hi everyone, I am writing from Italy, I am a super noob in the skate world and even more in that of esk8.

From the first day I saw a mountain esk8 on youtube I was kidnapped and I can't think of anything else! So here I am to expose those millions of doubts that run through my head.

I gathered more information than I could on the forum before writing because I didn't want to be too heavy for you, but I got to the point of being too confused to learn for myself ...

My idea of Mountain esk8 that I would like to build is similar to this:

**H2C 2 x 800 W Brushless Motors Electric Skateboard**

https://it.gearbest.com/kick-scooter/pp_1518701.html?wid=1433363

Main features:

● Powerful dual 2 x 800 W motors, maximum speed 38 km / h, gradient can be overcome up to 25 degrees

● 11000 mAh battery (included in the package), 20 km max

● Remote control to adjust speed (beginner speed and expert speed)

● 8-inch solid rubber wheel, wear-resistant and durable to use on different terrain

● The motor cover has better heat dissipation and plays a dust-proof role, the use of the brushless external rotor motor

● 8-layer maple and 2-layer bamboo edge with non-slip design, durable and safe for outdoor use

● Remote control power supply: 200 mAh lithium ion battery (included in the product), the control range is 14 km and the recharge time is 1.5 hours

Battery: Lithium ion battery

Mileage (depending on the road and weight of the driver): 15-20km

Maximum mileage: 20 km

Max Payload: 200kg

Battery Capacity: 11000mAh

Battery Voltage: 36V

Rated Motor Power: 2 x 800W

Input Voltage: 100-240V AC

Charging time: 6 hours

Rubber Diameter: 8 inches

Clearance Pedal Earth (There is no weight bearing): 14 centimeters

Youtube video where I saw it:

https://youtu.be/4Bnnz39ttgI

The price of this esk8 is very good (I think), today it costs € 540 for flash sales but honestly I really want to build it myself. My fear is that building it from me costs much more, do you think it is?

Now I come to my doubts about the construction, starting with what I know.

The components:

- **Board** . (this I believe will be the last thing I will think about but I gladly accept advice)

- **Engines** . I thought I would put two 800W motors like the model above, with belt drive, do you have any suggestions? Where can I buy them? Are there stores where they are cheaper? It is convenient to buy more powerful engines in case you want to increase the battery and I also believe the ESC?

- **Esc** (or Vesc). On this subject I am really ignorant. I don't know how to choose it. I think I understood that the parameters are the maximum voltage and maximum amperage that can be supplied. But I don't know how many models exist, what are the best models. Is it the Esc that eventually deals with managing the two speeds (beginner and expert)? Are it hard to set? Does Vesc handle sending battery charge data? And finally, is Vesc managing the transmission system between the radio control and the esk8?

- **Batteries** . . I thought of using LiPo batteries because I know them little but better than the Li-Ion (even if in commercial esk8 I always seem to find Li-Ion (why?). If I used LiPo batteries, how many cells do you advise me to put in series and how many groups in parallel? A 10s3P or 12s2p or what else? What grade C do you recommend (the minimum value, I know that the higher it is the better it is for batteries) But the biggest doubt about batteries is the balancing connector for charging. Where should all balancer connectors be connected? Perhaps to a BMS?

One more thing about batteries, I saw that some built the LiPo battery pack from a cell without a balancer connector (https://hobbyking.com/it_it/turnigy-5000mah-1s-40c-lipoly-single-cell.html) , how will they load the package without blowing up the esk8?

- **BMS** . I do not know what a BMS really does, is there a dedicated threed on the forum? I read (I don't remember exactly where) that with LiPo batteries it's not necessary but it's useful, what does it mean? Perhaps, if the LiPo balance connectors go to him, does it allow the charge and discharge by balancing the cells? Is the BMS or Vesc to protect the batteries from excessive discharge?

- **Trucks** . I really like those with springs (I apologize for ignorance, I know I will make people laugh for how I express myself). I've seen them in a video (https://youtu.be/jSxdPojJ0ow min 5:07) and call them Matrix Trucks, but I don't know which ones fit to mount and if the axes section will be fine for mechanical parts for belt drive. Can anyone recommend a mix of Trucks, mechanical parts for belt drive and wheels (from Mountainboard, 8 inc credo) that are compatible with each other?

- **Remote control** . Do you have advice on a remote control and receiver? Should it be suitable for the Vesc I will choose or are they universal?

- **Vesc protection circuit** . On the forum I read an article that showed a protection circuit for the Esc (https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/3d-printed-boosted-board-killer/88803/3), do you use it?

Surely I have a thousand other questions to do but I think they are too many for the moment ...

If you have useful links both for information and for the eventual purchase of the material I need, please write to me.

Thank you so much for your patience

Andrea

Here is a really great topic to start with.

If you buy that board I can almost guarantee you that you will want more and have a hard time finding compatible upgrades. You will want to improve the battery, then you will want a VESC controller, then better trucks, then a better deck, etc.

It will be cheaper only in the short run. Diy is intimidating with all the knowledge spread out but you will end up with a much better machine and a ton of useful knowledge.

I almost bought that same board when I started this journey! 

Here I am now, with a second build almost finished

If you aren't putting the whole charging current through it, 26AWG won't melt, assuming you're certain the charge current isn't going through it. (only the balance current which is typically <200mA) However, also remember that thinner wire is more prone to physically breaking after many thousands of miles/kilometers of extreme vibration.

I would use 22AWG or 20AWG -- and 24AWG at a minimum.

26AWG - 2.2A max continuous  
24AWG - 3.5A max continuous  
22AWG - 7A max continuous  
20AWG - 11A max continuous

It can increase amps, but not watts. Most builds, especially duals, run considerably less battery current than motor current. At low RPM (and thus low PWM), the ESC can act as a buck converter, converting the (for example) 40V and 40A from the battery to 20V and 80A for the motor. 

It doesn't really matter if the motor power rating is greater than that of your battery or ESC, because the motor is a dumb lump of copper, iron and neodymium, governed by the simple laws of thermodynamics.
It'd be very bad to try to draw 4KW from a battery that can only safely deliver 2, but running a motor at less than its rated maximum just gives you more safety margin, and can actually improve the efficiency a little.

Its 80a per motor, but i highly doubt it can support that. The phase wires are 12awg and the power is 10awg. If you pump 80 or 160 through those you will melt them. The flipsky could go with 6 awg on the power wires but instead chose 8. Its much better, but still not ideal. The unity seems way overhyped imo

12AWG will handle 80A, barely. 10 will handle 120, which would be 60 battery amps per side, which is more than enough to feed 80 motor amps out.

This is esk8 in a nutshell.  If it's out of stock or unavailable, then you shouldn't plan on using it.

I've seen a lot of lists of parts with some/most out of stock.  Those esk8 never get built because by the time your parts are in-stock, if ever, there are newer, better parts available that will work there, requiring a redesign of your other parts.

TL;DR: don't build with vaporware parts

What's the difference in using the motor (+focbox) to charge the battery if:
1. I don't break and just let the motor spin while driving down a mountain 
2. Break (with regen enabled and set to an appropriate value)

Isn't the motor charging the battery in situation 1 as well? When I spin the motor by hand the "charged capacitance" value in the vesc tool increases so it charges right?

Think of it this way:

Spinning your wheel by hand takes very little effort

Spinning the wheel by hand with brakes on takes more effort

That effort directly relates to energy which directly relates to electrical energy able to be recovered. 

If you notice, a hub motor has much more rolling resistance than a free wheel. That is energy exchanged by making the motor work as a generator.

Hello, I’ve been lurking a few months now, learned a bunch so far, I’m building a budget board to commute to work, gym, corner store. The furthest is the gym it’s about 3 miles driving, so range is not that important as of yet, maybe on my next build.

anyhow, I purchased some battery packs I found on eBay that were used in electric skateboards and the boards were returned or whatnot, the listing claimed some cells may be disconnected etc. I was prepared to do a cheap battery and relay/Arduino welder to repair them, but to my surprise they are all good, shipped to me at 40v. I opened them up anyway just to be sure all was good. They are 10s2p 4000mah, I ordered two to run parallel. I checked balance and they are all almost perfect. I understand they are prob weak and will sag, I live in flat earth, Florida, the only grade I climb is the little slope onto the sidewalk lol. I only paid $60 for the pair to make 10s4p and may get another for 10s6p if there is too much sag or not enough range. 

My question is, about the bms. I want to verify it’s a bms and not just a protection board. ![image|375x500](upload://tfMju1ONPwJQodWemLPMm194qzi.jpeg)

Freewheeling regenerates practically zero energy. Braking regenerates energy proportional to your speed and the strength of your brakes. 

All motor setups have more resistance than a normal wheel, because the drivetrain has losses, and the motor has losses. If you just went down a mountain without braking, the drivetrain and motor would be warm or hot at the bottom, but your battery wouldn't be any more full, because 100% of the energy was lost as heat. If you applied brakes, the drivetrain would still be warm or hot, but your battery would be fuller, because some of the energy was being captured as electricity.

Looks like a BMS to me. That group of small components on top in the first picture looks like the usual chain of transistors and resistors used to bleed down any cell that's out of balance, and the aluminum plate on the bottom looks like a heat spreader for some fets.

You should look up some info on that BMS to find out how much discharge current it can provide. If it's not enough, you can bypass it for discharge by connecting the "P-" and "B-" pads together with a similarly sized piece of wire.

From my (admittedly limited) understanding, most commercial-grade bedliner sprays are some form of two-part thermoset epoxy or polyurethane/polyurea material, which while extremely tough, requires a special two-part mixing-and-spraying aparatus. Most aerosol versions are a much simpler solvent-based system.

my favorite paint for enclosure is Rustoleums textured outdoor paint. it pretty dang tough and its easily sandable. I have bottomed out on my fiberglass enclosure and all i did was fill the gouges with body filler, a light hand sanding to even it out, and then repaint over it. it looks good as new and the finish looks fantastic. dust barely shows up, and small rough areas of the enclosure are masked with the slight texture.

and maybe let´s look at the fusing current and not the continues current as that might be more interesting (wires less than 20cm etc).

with the 12AWG we are here at 235A :man_shrugging:

Besides all of that, I doubt that somebody will ever hit the wire limit on a regular esk8.

AAAnd besides that... come on guys... all that numbers are only marketing bla bla... like the C-Rating on Lipos.

There is no standard for measuring all that. Some use the data sheet values of there components, some use there test results, who knows... the cheap hw 4.12 vescs are promoted as 50A continues on not only on website. You think that is possible without any  additional heat sink or cooling? I doubt that.

What's your maximum discharge current? 12AWG is only good for 80, and that's right on the edge. Personally I wouldn't use 12 for anything above 70 or so.

18 is fine for balance leads, if possibly a little overkill. I'd go with 20 or 22, but either works.

I haven’t seen one yet 😔. I would be glad to see those data, so if you have some metr data or similar I would be happy if you could upload some, including pictures of the board that I can copy it 😂😜


Small edit to the xt60. Might want to watch that video with a load test.
https://youtu.be/qEdysiZAYZ4
I’m more a fan of xt90 and 8-10awg but 10s with 180a over an xt60 with 12awg without any damage is pretty lot i think. Not sure who could run such battery currents. Ok, to be fair maybe duffmann 😅


Edit edit: might want to watch that as well.

As you might see out of the log data there is not really a constant load. If you would drive up a steep hill off-road for 500m or more that might look different.

Reading the data sheet of a product you want to buy is always a good start. After that have a small research with google or here and most questions will be answered pretty fast.

Edit: as we in the noob thread, 30q data sheet says 15A discharge but they good for 20A discharge. So 80A max on a 4p pack

If you have space in your enclosure also use xt90 connectors. They also more easy to solder if you use bigger wires.

Like @Andy87 said, spend the extra couple dollars, and go with 10AWG and XT90 connectors, it's cheap insurance. Overkill is underrated, and improves reliability. 30Q cells have a datasheet rating of 15A, but if you compare their discharge graphs to other cells, they actually perform better than many 20A rated cells. Besides, esk8 very rarely provides enough load to draw the full 80A from a pack for more than a dozen seconds or so at a time anyway.

If you use wire big enough to carry 80A @grrsona

I personally use [this chart](https://www.powerstream.com/Wire_Size.htm) which shows 12AWG as 41A, but realize that's for 24/7 continuous current.  You can probably double any of those numbers for 10 seconds or less.  Typically you wouldn't be at full throttle longer than that unless you're going up a huge, long hill at top speed.

Yes, but it also effects the handling. You can have negative rake or positive rack. 

Positive rake gives more ground clearance, but is less stable / more carvey. 

I run positive rake so I can make sharper U-turns on my commute, the increased ride height helps with wheel bite too. Still stable at 45kph for me.

The charger voltage absolutely has to match the battery voltage (12s to 12s) but the amps is subjective, check the data sheet for your cells to make sure but 4A on a 6p is almost guaranteed to be safe, if its a 30Q then you could charge at 36A theoretically.  The fuse you want should be +50% of what you expect give or take a bit so anything in the 5A to 7A is safe

Awesome! That was the ballpark I was looking at, thanks for the help.  From what I've read, does charging at high amps have a possibility of causing the battery to degrade faster?

More amps will chip away at the capacity over time but if you stay under 1C of charge its usually trivial compared to normal use (18A charge on a battery with 18Ah of capacity)

[quote="ZachTetra, post:5776, topic:9559, full:true"]
What’s an indicator of pack drift without a smart BMS or measuring cells individually?
[/quote]

One indicator is that the pack catches on fire, or the cells vent/start to bulge. 
Another is that some cells get hotter than others, or that the pack starts to act sluggish and not deliver enough power, or not keep a full voltage when it's removed from the charger.

All the above signs only show themselves once the pack has already been badly unbalanced and damaged by misuse. Without voltage measurements or a BMS, there's no way to tell until it's too late.

Trust, but verify. I'd recommend checking both voltages, and the current being supplied by the charger when the light is green (There's often some charging still happening), with the same meter. I never trust my meters to 100% match, so it's an easy thing to do, check them against each other.

For the battery itself, or the the whole board?
For 10s4p, I wouldn't use any XT60, only an XT90. 
You'll need one female end for the battery, one male end for the board, another male/female pair for the loopkey, and then a pair for each vesc.

I'd just buy like a 5 or 10-pack, they're cheap enough that it makes no sense to not get a couple spares.

Make sure to get at least one XT90-S (antispark version) to use for the loopkey. The rest can be the regular non-antispark.

Hi guys,
Sorry for the bad resolution of the photo: that's the epoxied terminals of a female jst 2.0 foc sensor connector. I CF skinned the upper part of my deck but somehow the epoxy went through the shrink wrap and made the disaster. I managed to remove the plastic holder but as you may see terminals are pretty good encapsulated. Gap filling epoxy is like love: it will always  find the way :cry:.
Any advice how to solve the problem? Epoxy remover (which one?) + hot gun? Or should I remove the terminals and crimp new ones?

Higher C rating is always better it means less internal resistance in all cells and less heat build up/loss/voltage drop under load.  More overhead is always better assuming the mfg isn't just labelling a thing with higher specs than it can actually withstand.  In general the battery will wear less if you aren't pushing it to it's limits during charge or discharge (general rule of thumb having more overhead is always a good thing not running things to their limit either maximums or minimums is good)

Best whould be an electrical load (pretty expensive). Second best whould be a resistor that can handle the power (P=U^2/R), keep monitoring the voltage till you get to the voltage you want. The resistor method does not protect you from overdischarging and damaging the cell.

So. I recently acquired 2x vesc6. Installed it. Working but performance wasn't the same as my other focbox and unity. 

Vesc6 world is new to me. Read a few threads about it. Found out some use no_hw_limit. Some don't. Some had to change the settings due to it being underwhelming.

Does anyone know a good resource on how to set these things properly?

I'm currently using my unit/foxbox settings on my vesc6 (original) and I feel a significant performance loss.

Edit:
* Ack v. 3.102
* 6355
* Dual vesc6
* 12s4p

One pair for the battery, one pair for the antispark, and one pair for each speed controller. That makes a grand total of three for a single-drive, or four for a dual-drive build.

What mode are you using (BLDC/FOC, sensored, sensorless or hybrid)? What are your battery and motor current settings? Have you done a fresh motor detection? Have you done a fresh sensor calibration if you're using sensors? What are your voltage cutoff settings at?

Well, I'm using these for now since vesc6 is new to me. Weird part is. I tried

60
-60
60
-40

It's definitely faster with these settings. I tried the above on my unity/focbox. Holy sh!t balls. Crazy fast.

Perhaps, vesc6 has better power delivery? It's pretty smooth. FOcbox and unity is pretty raw.

I even had to change my pos ramping time to 0.2 from 0.3. it helped but not a lot. Played w throttle curve as well. Helped also. I even sorted to checking my battery cells if one or a few are dead. They're all within ~0.1v of each other. No Drv faults too. I'm out of ideas.

I used vesc6 on my last build, and I loved how smooth they were. I didn't have another controller to compare them to though, because I bough them after blowing my pair of 4.12s. I'm not a boarder before esk8, so I really liked that the power delivery was smooth and not very aggressive - Kept me from falling off as much. Still, even with the vesc6s, I had trouble staying on the board at a full throttle launch. I was running 40 battery amps and 80 motor amps on each side if I remember correctly. (Might have been 60 motor amps, I can't be 100% sure.)

Have you experimented with BLDC instead of FOC?  If you want raw surging not-smooth power, I hear that's the way to go.

Well. I like smooth also but the only reason why I haven't bumped up my settings to make it more aggressive is that it saves battery for me. It was plenty powerful and battery efficient when I was using the settings w focbox and unity.

I honestly think that vesc6 just exhibits better power delivery that it makes it seem slow but in reality it's not. It almost seemed like it has "finer" increments when you throttle it. Initially, I thought I had too much of a deadband setting. Vesc and remote is set to 2. I like it linear w no lag. 

I'll try your settings. Are you using no_hw_limit?

Hey there my young brother. :sunglasses:  I use that same bms just a higher amp version and yes you can use that switch but without the led.

Hello, new to the esk8 community, just started college so thinking that it would be nice to have a board to get around with. I don't need long range, 10-15km(6-9miles) is enough just to get around the campus occasionally, mainly just to get to and back maybe a few times a day to a mall connected to the campus with a covered walkway(<1km one way probably). So i don't need much range and speed, basically just to make my life easier. A small board is preferred. I don't have much to spend either. I live in Malaysia so i don't have access to the US parts. I'm looking at this board from china which basically fulfil what i want for just $70. Its quite short at around 60cm. here are the official specs

Wheel Diameter：73MM
Motor efficiency：250W/24V（1个电机）
Battery Capacity：24V/2.4AH
Theoretical Range：8-10KM
Maximum Load：100KG
Weight：3.6KG
Single Hub Motor
Maximum Slope angle：15 degrees
top speed：18KM/H

Yes I know Chinese so I can buy stuff from taobao easily.
Just wanted to know if this board is better or sourcing parts myself from taobao

Thanks big bro. Getting the led to work is unimportant to me. When the board is on, I will be riding it so I won't be able to see it :smirk:. I just need to make sure these switches are reliable and will not unlatch when I hit a bump turning off the board.

Right now I have this switch, which although reliable so far, needs a 20mm hole in the enclosure.

I like your choices there because it shows some good research.  What deck/enclosure are you building on?  
Motors are bullet proof but unsensored so will need a little push but sensors are just another thing to go wrong imo  (and are for pussies)
6.6 flipper is the best of the flippers according to popular consensus
Graphenes are the best of the best lipos but I would personally go for a higher c rated version.  40c minimum really to appreciate them fully
Mechanical kit from tb is good quality gear if you take the time to understand how to set up the mounts.  
Remote is something I'm not familiar so can only recommend my personal favs which are maytech or benchwheel.  Don't chance an untested remote my friend.  Its the most important part of any build.  Research the flipsky and get some real world testing before you pull the trigger.  (pun intended)
Get a build thread going with all this and move yourself out of the noob area.  Help will be forthcoming.  Good luck with the build.

Thanks for the answer @dareno .
Some questions.

1. About the skateboard deck, do you have any suggestions under 200$. I don't think I can have a flexy deck, couse I will probably not fit all the parts In two separate enclosure's. 

2. Do I need the flipsky Vesc dual 6.6? Or should I get the dual flipsky 4.20 plus, It can handle 12s.
Couse the 6.6 Vesc it is kinda expensive.

3. I thought the HK 192kv motor was sensored, any suggestions on other motor. The torqueboards 190 kv 6374 looks good.

4. I know I am asking alot but, any recommendations on a higher c raiting battery?

Thanks.

Motors are a hot topic right now and there are numerous threads on the pros and cons.  If you want sensored then go for maytech but they are pricey.  
Stick with the 6.6 flipper.  4.20 has some set up issues and I'm not sure that they like 12s very much so don't take the chance.
Stick with the graphenes but go for a higher c rated version.

As for decks;  What do you want it to do?  Do you want speed or carving?

I'm guessing you are based in europe but you really should update the profile to include location my friend, it helps to get recommendations for suppliers.  That said if i were you I would ask @bigben what he has available with regard to a hummie and enclosure.  Best of both worlds and the prettiest enclosures that don't break the bank.  You will have to change the battery to a liion set up though.  Lipos are very bulky unless you go for smaller s packs but then the wiring is more complicated.  I would personally have a battery builder put together a nice 30q pack with a charge only bms.  It will last longer and fit the profile of the deck/enclosure.
Builds start with the deck/enclosure and develop from there most of the time.

Mr @b264 is kind of set in his ways but it is a good remote saying that.  Just depends on your preference regarding triggers or thumbwheels.  I personally don't like triggers but some people do and more power to them. It is the most tested trigger remote available.
This is the best non hoyt thumbwheel remote there is currently available in my humble opinion

I have 2 basically new Torqueboard 6374's from my DIY board that need to be repaired. It doesn't have to be sensored if its just for a smooth start without pushing etc. I always push first. If i find something in the same price range sensored, that would be good too. Shipping inside the EU

How much space is between the motor mounts?  These sk3 motors are longer than the TB6374.  Do you have 85mm?  I forget the exact dimension.

If they will fit physically, they will work electrically.

Is there any place to get a ~20t HTD 5M 8mm bore motor pulley in the US? Shipping from China takes too long, and buildkitboards only offers a 15t pulley.

Or is a 15/60t ratio even good? I'm not sure what the top speed would look like for a 12s/6 inch tire/dual 6374 motors would look like. I tried using a calculator but I believe it's inaccurate due to AT wheels.

Also for waterproofing Ill get the above, as well as

Then I coat all the circuitry in a couple layers, then what about battery packs? I live in a wet area and water damage is one of my biggest concerns

MG Chemicals only sells wholesale.  You have to find them on eBay or Amazon.

The "silicone" is the most useful, "acrylic" is the second-most useful and "urethane" is useful for large wires and loop keys and stuff.  The solvent in the "acrylic" one is very nasty and eats a lot of things but it's fine on circuit boards.  If you get one, get silicone.  If you get two, get silicone and acrylic.  If you get all three, they are all useful if you know how to use them.

Acrylic is good in a single coat on things that get hot like heatsinks and FETs.  Acrylic also is very runny and is good for seeping into places you can't get the brush.  Acrylic has a nasty solvent.  In a pinch, you could use your wife's clear nail polish and dilute it with a tiny bit of nail polish remover to make a fake version of this.

Silicone is good on PCBs and most things but can hold heat.  It's great in multiple coats.  It's my goto unless there's a reason to use acrylic or urethane.  Use it, and use a lot of it.  One coat, wait, one more coat, wait, one more coat.  Put it wherever you don't want water to be.  It's not going to hurt the electronics, but the water will.  Displace it with this stuff.

Urethane is good on large tactile things like the loop part of a loopkey and the solder junction between two 10AWG wires, et cetera.  It's the least-useful of the three, but still is useful.  It can pop off if flexed too much.

Lovely.
Im about to ask the most noob question on this forum

do motors have built in heatsinks? If not I dont have a heatsink. Don't think I have an FET.

Okay I will def get silicon, coat all my elctronics in it.

I got a BMS from bestech with a switch, so im not sure about using a loopkey (should I still?) but if I do I should probably waterproof it. Is there any real point to putting Eurethrane on the battery solders? If water gets into the shrinkwrapped pack im screwed anyways. I dont plan on riding through puddles, but if the concrete is wet wheels will kick up water.

I always see people with broken anti-spark switches, does the e-switch on a good BMS and ESC get the same issues?

Plan is BesTech HCX-D223V1 and Unity with the 'loopkey' as the connection between them, not gonna touch any of the switches unless it goes into storage for a while or I need it dead when cops are around, using the _roll_ to start and auto shut off features instead

It all depends.  I use XT90S and XT60 and -- rarely -- XT90

You have to engineer your own esk8.  Do what you need to do to make it work ;-)

I use XT60 sometimes because the FOCBOXes used to come with those already on them.

As long as an antispark is between the BMS and ESC it will protect it (assuming its the last connection you make), usually we have a loopkey that is left inside the enclosure or pokes through, but you can wire an XT90s into the BMS out lead and do that instead to save space (its what I'm going to do)

Yes.

Very rarely I use female XT90.  I use female XT90S and male XT90 and male/female XT60 a lot.

Typically XT60 for a single-motor-in-a-dual-motor system

and XT90 for a single motor system or for both-motors-in-a-dual-motor-system

Like this, where both drive currents go through an XT90 but each ESC itself uses an XT60.

![20190412_223213|690x388](upload://36MfqRAL2RBXpzLk6me5v7iC2k0.jpeg) 

Also, spend the extra few cents and buy "Amass" brand connectors.  It's silly not to.  They're barely more expensive and twice as good.

Keep them plugged together while soldering so the pins stay straight.  That means you'll need a few extra connectors ;-)

When you buy a pack of Xt90s connectors, you are receiving an Xt90s female and an xt90 male. There is no such thing at an Xt90s male. The female part is the special part because it has a small built in <s>fuse</s> resistor.

By official, we just mean use the brand Amass (in the description from the supplier). They are well tested and trusted.

Those are all adapters. You want bare plugs like this, so you can make up your own wiring harness: 
 
https://www.amazon.com/Venom-RC-Female-Connector-Battery/dp/B00WND5L6A 

That is five pairs of regular XT90 connectors - five male, and five female. 

You will **also** want one of these: 

https://www.amazon.com/XT90-S-Female-Connector-Battery-Charge/dp/B00RVM8U5W 

That is one pair of XT90-S connectors - one female antispark, and one male regular.

You will have a grand total of **six** male connectors, **five** regular female connectors, and **one** female antispark connector to make your loopkey from.

You only need **four** male connectors, **three** regular female connectors, and **one** antispark connector, but it's usually cheaper and/or easier to just get a five-pack so you have spares.

Those are the exact same link for both; the same item.

In general, anywhere you can use an XT90 female plug, you can also use an XT90S female plug, but not the other way around.  The male plugs are identical for both.

So, generally you can skip XT90 and only order XT90S.

I have a few XT90 female plugs, and only use them in certain cases.  They do have a slightly bigger contact patch and technically work slightly better (albeit without the antispark resistor).  But we're splitting hairs here.  They're basically the same.

@Yarden 
Yes, but. 

Yes, you can use hub motors as belt motors in theory.
But, you'll essentially have to have access to a machine shop to make it work.
You'd have to make your own custom motor mounts, and your own custom pulley system.
And even then, with many hours and many dollars invested, they still won't be nearly as good as actual motors designed for belt use.

Just buy regular motors if you want belt drive. Save the hubs for a toy board.

Coasting with a dead battery is fine as far as I know as long as it’s there. 
 I have to get a blue tooth logger again but does coasting at low or high speed not charge at all?  If ur in danger of blowing up ur stuff even coasting around without a battery it makes sense it must be charging a little.  Damn gotta get one them loggers for iPhone going.

Could an electrical engineer or BMS guru please check my wiring diagram? 

Its 12s1p Lipo pack made from 6 2s packs. The BMS can do 14s but will also work at 12s. I am only using it for charging. 

The 3 wires coming out of the batteries is the balance plug that comes on them.

It should also be noted that 260KV with a 10s battery is well above the safe ERPM limit for 4.12 based ESCs. Unless you have a 6.x based ESC and have a reason to use that motor, you're much better off getting one of 200kv or less. 170/190/200 are the common ones in that range.

Apparently my diagram above is not the whole story as this a 9 to 15s BMS, but I got it setup as a 14s, although I want to use it as 12s. (At least for now). 

So I can use the PC programer to change to 12s or short some balance pins according the texas instrument data sheet, and wire my balance wires accordingly.

In terms of peak watts, you'll hit the limit of the speed controller or battery, whichever is lower, but only for short bursts. In terms of power consumption over distance, I'd estimate between 30 and 60 watt-hours per mile. Depends on how hard you ride and a lot of other factors.

I think dual 6355/6354 is a perfect balance of power and cost/weight. Dual 6374 is major overkill unless you're building a mountainboard. Maytech makes some of the best motors around, with all the little attention to detail like epoxied windings and conformally coated sensors. There are quite a few other folks on here that sell motors, but I don't remember all the names/companies.

Can I ask why you are using channels on an Evo?  It goes so far against design that the problems you will find will be insurmountable I fear.  
The evo deck is designed for 50 degree reverse king pin trucks and as such works like a charm but to attempt to use channel trucks will be a huge task.  Not against innovation but surely theres a more suitable deck out there for you to utilise?  The deck is built for fast riding and to set up channels for riding fast is an expert level event on a deck designed for them let alone on an evo.  Just trying to save you some headaches in the future my friend.

I can't see any reason why rkp wouldn't work with large numies but keep the kv low or you will lose acceleration trying to spin up those monsters and then go on to ridiculous high speeds. Around the 140 mark.  Probably the most loved trucks atm are surfrodz rkp and tkp for more manoeuvrability.  Anything with a wide hanger though is the go here.  I believe trampa make a nice set too but they are pricey.  3d servisas make a 230 hanger too but again costly.  If you were to go trampa then the pneumatic wheels and pulleys/mounts and clamps etc will all work together and save you some headaches.  Good luck with the build though and keep the updates coming.

I'm guessing you want a kind of all terrain build as opposed to a full on emtb so rkp's will work fine.  You can always change to urethane and have a street beast too

Right now I have evenly spaced wheels on both front and back (the distance between wheels, the "stance"). But I am able to shave off, like, 5-7mm in the front from each side, making the front narrower.

Would this bring any positive changes, or shouldn't I even bother and keep the wheel spacing exactly the same on both rear and front truck?

depending on your trucks the Sk3 and Sk8 could be too long in dual. check the motor specs on hobby king for this.
If you plan to build a MTB than it will work on trampa or MBS trucks, there is enough space.

regarding esc, get a focbox unity. they now on sale if you get two you get them for 199$ and you can sell one. Buuut I don´t know when they will ship them out if you order now, so if you plan to finish your build in the next 4 weeks that is probably no good idea than.

I would rather go with HW6 vesc than 4.20, but again it depends on how much space you have and how much current you plan do draw on your build.

Hi, hoping you guys can help with this - a simple one maybe? 
I have a loopkey that disconnects my vesc from my battery and then a charge only BMS setup that doesn't need the loopkey in to function - i.e plugging in the charger competes the circuit.
Normally I charge without the loop key in - with the vesc off.
What I want to know is will it damage my vesc if I charge, with the loop key in (the vesc switched on)?
I want to know for two reasons - 
1. So I can bench test and tweak while charging ( or is this a bad idea?) 
2. So I can see the voltage when charging via phone app and my voltmeter.
Any thoughts? I've searched the forum and can't really find an answer other than that some non-diy boards do this when their BMS or antispark switches fail... Last thing I want to do is wreck my vesc though!
Thanks!
Mike

I wouldn't do it just because I feel like their would be more likely be a spark when plugging in the loop key while it is charging because you a completing the circuit of the board.  I'm not 100% sure but I would think it is just good practice to not do it.

Hello!

Im thinking of building a new board for myself! actually I allready got a board but non Electric. i got a  Long Island 38" with drop through trucks! I usualy like gas Engines when im building stuff, like a motor powered bicykel or something like that. but im not going to put a lawnmower Engine on a longboard haha. thats why im asking you nice people to help me out here. 

my weight is around 80kg, i live in sweden with both hills and straight roads. I like to build a strong bord with much torque and high topspeed, ca 50-60 KM/H. thats why im using dual motors. what do you think? is it possible?

I would like to build a dual belt motor longboard. Will these part fit eachother? what would you change in my shopinglist? I dont know anything about ampiere or watts so please help me here.

dual is fine the only issue some have with it is that if one side dies then the whole board will have to get taken out.  Otang doesnt make kegel core wheels in 75 smallest is 80mm your loaded would be around 32 if you increase the wheel size the speed will go up.  here are some calculators to play around with settings

So my charger is hard wired into the BMS (discharge BMS and the DC leads of the charger are soldered to the positive and C-) and its never given me issues...the entire system is always fully connected since the loopkey is locked inside the enclosure and the power button is dead

I mean its not a good idea but its not outrageously dangerous either

Limit the amps in the VESC to be a little low and it should be okay-ish, you can slightly overvolt motors if you drop the amps so the power stays the same, but a 10s battery is in your best interest

Efficiency isn’t that important...the system is around 70 to 90% efficient depending

Continues discharge is how many amps a system can sustain without damage, you can burst and pull more amps but it gets very hot

These are mutually exclusive.

I would get the [Mini Remote](https://forum./t/how-to-bind-the-mini-remote/95) and skip the screen at first since your budget is in the red zone.  You can always upgrade the remote later if desired.  You could even use the Mini Remote innards to do so.

At partial duty cycle, the ESC acts like a buck converter - it steps down the battery voltage, and increases the current. As a result, at low speed you can have far more current flowing through the motor than the battery is supplying. Vedder actually uses this method in his synthetic stress tests - Run the motor at extremely low speed, and you can run 80+ motor amps from a 5-amp lab power supply.

Wow, thanks.  So does that mean that the main output the VESC's are advertising i.e. "Flipsky 50a VESC 4.20" is the motor max? And so in that case I shouldn't worry about having a battery that can output continuously 50a and then some to prolong the life?

If you read the specs, it'll usually say "X battery amps, Y motor amps." More battery current is always better - overbuilding results in wider safety margins and room to expand/upgrade in the future. I don't know what your build looks like, but if possible stay away from 4.x based ESCs - they have some known flaws that some manufacturers don't address.

To expand on @MysticalDork very concise advice.  Do not run your battery amps at the limit of your vescs capabilities.  Never a good idea.  Always leave a little salt on the bread.  Motor amps you can adjust according to heat build up and specs but if you go over on battery then poof.   

To quote LHB  " I have a drawer full of poof"

Except that if he wants to actually ride the board this year, the unity isn't really an option unless he wants to pay double the price for a resold one. 

I'm in the same position as him, and I want to be able to ride this summer, so no unity for me. The updated flipsky dual 4.2 is probably where I'm going.

Edit: I should add to the guy that he should NOT buy a second hand flipsky 4.2, because they have dodgy caps from my understanding. Only the recent (like last couple weeks) updated 4.2s on the Flipsky site are the ones where they supposedly fixed the issue with uprated components. Not sure if this has been tested by people yet but Flipsky seems to have a semi-decent reputation on here so I would expect it to be ok.

I want to modify a longboard deck I got from a college. Due to my bad hip and since I don’t have much experience in pushing a board, I want to make it drop through (never tried drop through ever). The only thing I can find that is close to what I’m trying to achieve is this 

![image|500x500](upload://hnm93Euj76ZyTbe3uHDu2w3Y0q1.jpeg) 

My board has a shorter wheelbase and I see a risk where the foot might touch the rear wheel when carving since the foot placement will be on top of the truck mount (which doesn’t seem comfortable?) 

Are there other good reasons why there are few short dropthrough decks with kick tail? 

I want a drop through but I don’t want to ruin the deck if it’s a dumb idea :)
Here my now shortened deck. 55cm wheelbase.

Check your motor specs and set it up according to that. If you want to go higher than that, keep an eye on the motor temperature. If you see the motors get hot pretty fast your settings are too high.

Short drop-through decks increase the risk of wheel bites.
Short decks are structurally high deck heights.
It makes kick-push difficult.
Short drop-through decks probably have only a small gap between the wheel and the deck.

Hey guys, I have an Ollinboards VESC, And have a question about it. It seems to be ignoring the power button I have plugged into it, and I've tried with a few different ones. Is there some setting I'm missing? It turns on and is "armed" as soon as I plug in the battery.

I got a roller to apply the resin and use a ghetto vacuum (clothes bag). With this one the first layer went somewhat whack because I had a weak mold and didnt use enough hardener the first layer. I have a flex where I can make everything somewhat smooth again. I do agree the lips need to be way bigger if I keep working on it.

It would help to show the power button, but I don't think that's your issue. 

With esk8 we typically use two types of on and off switches - antispark *loop keys* and antispark *switches*

In reality, you could just plug the vesc in everytime you want to ride but 

A) people say that the spark wears down the components

And B) you likely have everything under the board.... No one wants to disassemble their board everytime before they ride it 

That being said most antispark switches are poorly designed and break at completely 'random' intervals, and antispark loop keys are very very reliable, and when they break they're easily repairable and (I could be wrong here, can someone else confirm? -> ) they pose less of a danger to the board when they fail. 

Or you could be onto something... :face_with_monocle:

I can tell you the differences between those motors my friend.
As @brenternet said one is sensored and one is not.
Internally they appear to be the same component wise and since the bearing upgrade the sk8 is a much improved unit.  The sk8 is more powerful than the sk3 by quite a bit too but I did have a sensor pcb fail on one of mine but apparently that has been fixed now also.
That said the sk3 has been around the model aircraft industry for ages and as such is the most reliable option.  I use both btw but the sk3 is my favourite because it runs cooler with the same settings.  You just have to give it a little nudge to get going.

Its usually a nasty job that requires the bearings to be destroyed in the process if the motor is well used.  Depends on the motors though.  Never had to do it on a tb but on a sk8 they came out pretty easily once I stripped the whole thing down.  Got to locate all the grub screws and undo without stripping them.  I believe the tb has a circlip too but don't quote me on that. 
One thing is true though once you've done it once you will know the motor mechanics inside out lol
Good luck

Hey everyone! If compare two 4000W motors by APS
- 6384 motor 100KV have torque: 6.9 NM
- 6384 motor 200KV have torque: 3.8 NM

200kv with gear 1:5 will give 19NM of torque (not including looses of gear)
100kv with gear 1:2.5 - 17.25 NM of torque (not including looses of gear). 
Does it mean that 200KV more effensive (1.75NM more) than 100KV with the same power consumption?

## \#6141 Posted by: MysticalDork Posted at: 2019-04-22T00:39:34.520Z Reads: 69

Theoretically, yes. Lower KV means more wraps of wire around the stators, which means more resistance, more heat, less power. Ideally you want the highest KV you can safely use without exceeding the ERPM limit of the controller.

On the flip side though, higher KV means higher ERPM, which can lead to higher switching and eddy current losses. 

I'd say you'll be fine either way. Unless you have a motor dyno to check those numbers, there's a chance of variation between motors, batches, and over time. 10% difference between the two isn't a deal breaker IMO.

Thank you! but i'm still confused..

For my project I need motor with as low KV as possible, or i need gear big ratio, because i'm riding BMX its 20" wheels (please dont ban me, i know it board-building forum)

I tend to buy 60/100KV 6374/6384 motor, simply because then gear will look much better.
The reason I'm not sure is that all MTB builders choose 170KV and gear 5:1 for 8" wheels, and with 3:1 gear they use 130kv motors and confirm that it has the same torque. It fits my calculations, but it doesn't mean that their power consumption is the same, isn't it?
Just wanted to know what the efficiency gains with an increase in KV
However 10% - it can be few extra kilometers of range.

You can put an 89mm can between the 218's.  Tight but it works.  Thats the sk8 6374 overall length.
This using all the tb hardware.

They are center set bearings but the urethane is wider, 65mm vs 51mm(based on my 90mm wheels) so the entire motor/mount/pulley/belt assembly has to slide in to account for the lost space.  If you use wider axles and a spacer then it's fine

Paris trucks are generally not good for esk8 use.  Also, they're round, so fitting motors to them is very difficult.  Or, should I say fitting motors in a way that lasts longer than a week

You should sell that to someone who has a Meepo for their front truck.  They seem to seem to think they're good.

Hypothetically, if I had 2 of the same motors and I connected them to a single wheel in a triangle, could I plug the 'master' motor with sensors into the ESC and splice the 'slave' motor into the phase leads?

I know it's more bulky and costly than a single large motor but I think it would be kinda cool to have a narrow back truck with 4 motors

No; each BLDC motor needs its own ESC.  If they were DC motors, you could do that.  In fact, with DC motors you could put all 4 motors on one ESC.

In theory yes.

In theory you could run two motors from one ESC, but only if you had them locked together so they couldn't spin independently at all, and had them clocked right so the magnets and coils in each one were in exactly the same place and in phase with each other. In theory, it can be done. 

In practice, all bets are off. 

Only one way to find out! Go for it and post the results here!

This is the tricky part, and why you can't run motors on two wheels with one ESC, because they won't stay clocked unless they share a live axle.

@ZachTetra pulling power from an Ollin VESC is how we turn our motors. :wink:

 Normally, in most high performance motor controllers, you do not want an integrated power switch. They are two different components with different failure rates. Sure, an integrated switch makes a build a little simpler but it also robs the builder of using a more robust solution like using a loop key.

Depending on how stuck and recessed the remaining threaded part is, it should be possible to back it out using either a left-hand drill bit, a screw extractor, vice-grips or a dremel tool.

Next time, may I recommend grade 12.9 alloy cap-head screws rather than stainless button-head ones. Far less likely to either strip or shear off.

You should be okay with just three for the short run. The torx is a good idea - even less likely to strip than hex. You'd have stripped a hex screw before you twisted the head off it. If you can find some torx head 12.9 socket cap screws, that's like the holy grail.

Is this correct?

Battery min = battery Regen = Max brakes at high speed.

I'm finding myself needing good strong brakes at high speed lately but based on searches I did, most use -12 to max of -15. This is based on:

3amp (max charge rate (18650 samsung30q)) * #p cells.

3 * 4(4 parallel) = 12. 

This equates to 24 of theoretical max regen for a xS4P battery. Negative value since it's battery min.

I have my dual Vesc set to -25. Is this safe or too aggressive no a setting?

Thanks.

Blue is what you want as you are able to remove a screw if you need to take it out or do some adjustments.  The red is permanent.  To remove a screw that you used red loctite on you would have to heat the screw.  Also remember to clean any bolts you are going to be using loctite on before use.

How do you measure the width of a deck?  Trying to buy a new deck (38" - 42") but one of the conditions the minimum width is at least 9.5" (240mm).  When a site says a deck is XX.XX" wide, is that the maximum width or a nominal width?  Also recommendations?

Currently looking at...can anyone validate the minimum center width?

- Rayne Demonseed 42"
- East Side Blazer V2 40"

From what I've seen, decks are almost always NOT as wide as claimed, and, if so, only at one spot, and not quite even the full width there.

The [Flybar - Glitch deck](https://www.amazon.com/Flybar-Skate-Twin-Longboard-Skateboards/dp/B01M32D6SS/ref=sr_1_12) on Amazon is the widest deck I've found but it needs carbon fiber on the bottom to stiffen it if you want to use it.

It's more likely that the socket on the board is damaged than that plug, but either is possible. You can buy replacement plugs - 5.5x2.1mm - and solder it in place of the old one. Ditto for the sockets.

I have little short 30cm charger cable extensions I use at work on both chargers.

The 5.5x2.1 I bought from Amazon but the GX16-3 one I made myself.

Their only purpose is so that when my coworkers trip over the cord, it disconnects right there instead of ripping the jack out of my board.  I HIGHLY recommend doing this.  It happened again today, in fact.

Don't buy those!  Get the 5.5mm x 2.1mm plugs.

Don't be fooled by the 2.5mm pins.  They can make your charger not fit the plug at best, and get really hot at worst.

Okay time for another dumb question! IM looking to power this motor;

600W
Voltages (can choose one): 24, 36, 48, 60

I want to avoid battery sag at all costs, and through a lot of research have seen that boosted boards continually push full power till they are dead. Ive realized this is due to the A123 26650 cells used and their high amp output.

So heres my question, should I take the plunge and use the 26650 or just stick with the 18650? (I have a DieBieMS if that means anything)

My LiFePO4 do that also, but it's not because they're not sagging.  I see tons of sag on the power rails.  Way more than li-ion.

I'm not sure why they feel that way.  They definitely *feel* like they don't sag though.

The higher your "P" count in your battery configuration, the less sag you will have.

So if you have 60 cells, a 12S5P will sag a little more than a 10S6P for example.

Re: not feeling like sagging, it's possible that Boosted is doing something clever like dynamic current settings - increasing the maximum allowable current as the voltage drops, to keep the wattage constant.

Also LiFePO4 has a flatter discharge profile then LiPo and far flatter than Li-ion. Even though it sags, it probably doesn't sag as much proportionally when nearly dead as nearly full.
```

That was my thought as well.  It sags a lot, but the amount it sags when completely full is just about the same amount as when it's nearly dead.  (3.0V / cell under load, 3.0V to 3.65V / cell open-circuit)
```

---
## \#6270 Posted by: MysticalDork Posted at: 2019-04-25T08:00:32.851Z Reads: 75

Exactly. That's one of the places li-ion adds a lot of energy without adding a ton of capacity - especially the extreme high-energy-density (4.35v etc) variants really emphasize retaining the initial voltage for a while to maximize area under the curve, but as a result the whole line has a slope to it and falls off a lot near the end.![image|690x388](upload://nAlLwoExC6cEBAuPT0C96vN6s2H.png) ![image|690x388](upload://9UEzqJ3A5AXirpL9KbZ0U9yPNj.png) Top: Samsung 25R 2500mAh. Bottom: A123 26650M1A 2300mAh. Both tests at 15A.

That's also something that can make battery gauges difficult on LiFePO4 and other flat discharge chemistries - It's really hard to gauge a battery if it only drops 0.2v under load from 90% full to 90% dead.

I mean it will work, you won't get the full power of the battery or motor but you also don't need to.  You're gonna cap around 1800W which isn't bad

If you're gonna be hurting for torque then you can squeeze out some more power with a better VESC

My motor pulley is sitting too far out, which is causing it to be misaligned with the wheel pulley as well as rubbing against the wheel. I noticed theres a clip on the motor shaft thats about the thickness that i need to trim. What is its function/can it be removed? Or do i need to shave off the pulley until it fits?

Looks like that shaft has moved a little. Might want to check the setscrews at the back, and tap that shaft gently back until the circlip and shim are snug against the bearing again.

You can file down keys if  they're a tight fit - It's possible you have 1/8" (3.175mm) keys and 3mm keyways. It's pretty quick to take 0.175mm off with some sandpaper or a file. You can get away without a key if you use Loctite 680, but it's not best practice, and I like having  a physical piece of steel in there - it helps my peace of mind.

Yes, but the stator and housing of the motor are designed very carefully to mitigate eddy currents. By adding anything electrically conductive or magnetic will ruin all that work. Best case scenario you loose torque and efficiency. Worst case you burn the motor

nanometer scale particles, encapsulated and suspended in a nonconductive fluid matrix. No eddy current issues. You get a little bit of viscous drag, but it's negligible.

Put a bag around the motor or cut the pulley when it's not on the motor.

Ok so i have been searching and have found nothing on this atleast not for the application of an e-board, e-scooter, or ebike.  So instead of starting a new topic over it i wanted to know and ask here.  Can i put 2 motors on a single side of a board or scooter? The idea being dual motors on single belt. Or even dual hub motors on each side of a board for 4wd on the rear side.  Like dual hub motors on this but more over dual motors on the same belt

Yes but each motor has to have its own ESC, you can belt all 4 pulleys or pair them 1 to 1.  Make sure they all spin the right way and have the same settings obviously

If you have access to metal working tools you can make a single plate for both motors with a tensioner slot

You’re not wrong but your attitude kind of is.  You do all the math you want but it won’t alter the fact that higher c rated lipos work more efficiently 


Also c rating is not a reliable enough standard to base anything around.  I was advising the guy to go for a higher rated particular battery because I have used both.  Now if you have anything constructive to say then please do but if it’s just snarky bollocks then keep quiet.

Yea you're right. Afaik the C Rating is only a theoratical point of Orientation to know, what a lipo can achieve. In practice the max amps are lower than the theoratical one. I personelly work with 20C Lipos with 5 Ah. But in the end it relies on person itself, what to choose(with advice), right?

Thats kind of a how long is a piece of string question Zach.  The shape is entirely up to you and your design flare but the size of the mould will be the amount of internal space you will have inside your enclosure.  Think about including enough room for some vibration protection, foam etc.  You want things to be snug but not too tight.  Its easier to include more padding but not so easy to get more space should you need it.

Snug dude.  You don't want anything rattling around at all.  Best case scenario is to imagine the components being suspended in the enclosure with movement up and down and side to side without any kind of space.  The only movement you should get should be within the movement characteristics of the foam.  Not the characteristics of just air.  So you need to be able to get foam all around every item. 
 ![IMG_1044|375x500](upload://7I8IlK2kJ4G9OIPESytZB2CL8oZ.jpeg) 
This has foam underneath and on top and on the sides.
Next one will have a complete packing foam with cut outs for the components like a camera case.

On this one I have too many.  You really only need two holes in the enclosure other than the wiring.  Charge port and switch.  I have remote programming jacks which I will never do again btw and a battery meter.  Not necessary with bluetooth tech and @b264 nifty little battery checkers.  Keep it simple.  
Personally I'm not a lover of bluetooth modules and the info they provide.  Not necessary in my opinion or on my boards. Too many issues atm.  I program my stuff to the limit of their capabilities and ride.  If theres a problem then the enclosure has to come off but build it right and the problems are minimal.  Logging in via bluetooth to find out whether the board is malfunctioning is half the fix.  I always go in there to check physical elements because my health depends on this thing.  You want waterproofing then you NEED BRIAN.  Hes the guru.

I'm running LEDs and headlamps off the main power so there are leads out to the lights and leads both way for the buck converters (they don't fit)
- 2x triple phase
- 12x sensor
- 4x pair buck
- 4x led power (power injection either end of 2 strips)
- 1x pair led data
- 5x pair lamp
- 1x pair charge
- 1x ESC switch
- 1x BMS switch

I'm thinking XT30 for the light stuff and MT60 for the phase, not sure about sensors but I know there were the 9 pin plugs

Both, and if you put it in the right places can be impact absorbing.

Picture your board rolling into an immovable object hard like @Sender's board did -- imagining the contents of the enclosure all wanting to smash into the front/back of it --- the silicone is like airbags for the electronics.

But you have to use neutral-cure silicone.  In the USA, that's "GE" brand "Silicone 2+" from the paint section of Home Depot / Lowe's / Menard's

Mt headlight was a 28W LED, but I only ever ran it at ~8W, and it was already obnoxiously bright. Nearly 80W of LEDs, even RGB ones that aren't as efficient as white, will be just STUPID bright. The lumen equivalent of maybe 700+ watts of incandescents.

Probably gonna run the RGB at 20% for indicators and brakes, and the white at 50% because they cover a massive spread so it's still low candela

I want a high max output because I'm going on back roads at speed, I need to see bright as day for the next 100ft around bends and have 0% chance of getting run over, full power will be hazards and high beams.

I'm working on a Bluetooth Arduino remote to run them all, nothing super advanced yet, just PPM to the Unity and RGB, and absolute voltage to a DC motor controller for the lights

Maybe one day I'll use servos and more Arduinos so I can direct the lights with the 9 axis in the remote

No, it's $60 for one. They're super compact, super robust and super efficient, and thus super expensive too lol

I have a slightly smaller $40 one for my bike. 2"x1.25"x0.4" and 40W 12V from an 84v battery. 91% efficiency.

BoltDepot.com is an excellent source of hardware in the US, and often cheaper than McMaster. 

Since they're metric fasteners, you don't want grade 8. Metric strength grades aren't the same as imperial grades - Metric grade 8 is about equivalent to imperial grade 5. The metric equivalent to grade 8 is 10.9, and 12.9 is even stronger, equivalent to imperial L9 or A574. You want grade 10.9 or 12.9 hardware wherever possible.

Stainless is usually between 50 and 110K psi.

Hello Esk8ers

I had a good setup last summer but didnt take care of my lipo and it died :( 
Here is my previous setup which worked great but since I not gotta buy a new Lipo I was wondering if some could tell me if I matched the motor, ESC, and battery correctly or can suggest what battery I should buy this time. 

Motor: 
Turnigy Aerodrive SK3 - 6374-192KV Brushless Outrunner Motor
|Voltage: 10~12S Lipoly =37-44.4V||
|RPM/V: 192KV||
|Max Loading: 80A||
 
ESC: 
Turnigy SK8-ESC For Electric Skateboard Conversion (W/BEC)				
|Max Cont Current: 150A||||
||Max Burst Current: 170A for 10 seconds||||
|Input Voltage: 2-6 cells li-XX or 6-16 Ni-MH/Ni-Cd battery||| 3.7*6= 22.2V???

Battery: 
ZIPPY Compact 4500mAh 6S 35C Lipo Pack


What I think I know: 
motor watts/ battery voltage = 124A
ESC is 150A 
Battery max discharge is 35C*4500mAh=158A

Hmmm is there are guide or link to matching Motor, battery, and ESC? 

Thank you for your time!

Check out this video for help. I used this method before but made the sides more narrow and not all the way to the edge of the board. It worked great and my enclosure is a perfect fit.

https://youtu.be/OdJWcsSZG4M
 
Just be warned, you need alot of patience to work with fiberglass. The sanding and body filler takes hours, but the end result is fantastic.

To make things easier, plane the enclosure flat with a long file and then fill with body filler and repeat. Once you have it looking good and smooth, wetsand in a tank of water or under a faucet up to about 400 grit is plenty. Paint with rustoleum filler/primer spray and then sand. Repeat until you are happy with the surface qaulity. Then cover it in something like rustoleum textured black paint. Its super tough and hides minor blemishes. If you scrape your enclosure just use body filler and repaint. This paint is fantastic for repairs. The entire part doesn't need a coat, just the damaged area.

Those lights are blinding, but the switch is awful it will go bad with vibrations in a matter of hours. Just buy one of these and use a step down. I use 2 on my mtb and its honestly overkill. 1 is plenty. They are compact and if you have a printer, i have a .stl file of a good mount for the light

They have a built in current limiter, so if you match the voltage you will be fine. No chance of frying the leds with overvoltage

If you're planning to tear out the batteries in the lights and drive them from the main pack, you might as well do it in one step by buying an LED driver, instead of making 9v and then losing more efficiency in the built in driver. [This one](https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/MEAN-WELL/LDD-1500H?qs=sGAEpiMZZMt5PRBMPTWcaaGhWv0C5pBADOgZ2HjvIEt%252BC%252BX7QVaIag%3D%3D) is 1.5A and will take anything from 8 to 52v in, and feed any LED or string of LEDs with a forward voltage less than its input voltage. Less than $7, and up to 97% efficiency. You can run two of them in parallel if 1.5A per LED isn't enough.

Looks too loose.  But you also don't want them too tight.

The idea is when going downhill if you slam on the brakes, you don't want the belt to skip.  You want it as loose as possible so that it still doesn't skip in that situation.

Another noob question here about motor current, and the esk8 calculator;

I'm comparing 6s to 10s with a maximum of 65 motor amps to see the theoretical maximum torque output with a matching gear ratio of (1 : 4.2). on a 3000 watt motor. If I were to reduce the motor wattage to match the actual wattage I would use for both voltages (voltage * amperage) would I get an accurate torque value?

[6s](https://calc.3dservisas.eu/?RY9LC8IwEIT_S84iSR_xcY3iSVko2LvmUMHSQI_if3dn1urtm8lkdvflbmlwe_d8lMmtVFxU1OuN8pw65VARRbEhJQS89xQHqNAaI1OZz86gWNARAUhu7V-RbnkWWehfVdgUib-i-8DBpCOriFeuCB7TNzmyfEdPJnBDBEVvUdg1jsz9zK1h59MZGcMeB-P2zGmte38A)

motor voltage doesn't exceed  battery voltage so you will get less volts to a motor at 6s, which means less speed and less total power

Under the assumption that the theoretical amp draw (battery voltage over motor resistance) is greater than the 65A the motor is rated for, you will not see a difference in torque, if its less than 65A then it will have less kick

@ZachTetra  I'm trying to wrap my head around this but I think I'm going in circles; I don't know the resistance of my motor but I keep getting 65 amps after dividing the voltage by the resistance so I don't think I have the right resistance. I tried finding resistance with this http://www.ohmslawcalculator.com/ohms-law-calculator but don't think it's what I'm looking for?

If it helps, my problem is that I'm stuck with a gear ratio I want for a 6s pack but don't want too little torque at 65 amps and nor do I want to lose torque by upping the voltage (but also the top speed) since I can't easily change my ratio. 

Math was never my strong suit and batteries confuse the heck out of me even after all the research I've done.

There is a pad on the BMS, labeled "C-". Your charging port, no matter what it is, needs to have the negative wire go to C-, and the positive wire go to the battery positive rail. It doesn't matter whether you use an XT plug, an XLR, barrel jack, whatever, as long as your charger has a mating plug.

OK so now I think I understand, Just to confirm.

Although 65 amps at 21.6 volts is only 1400 watts of power, 21.6 volts is still in the operating voltage range of the motor so there is little to no negative impact on torque, just speed from running such a low voltage. 

Thanks for walking me though this, I googled for hours and didn't find what I was looking for.

It’s hard to tell from your picture, but if the black wires from the jst are going to C-, it looks like the jst plug is your charge port connector.  You could either desolder the jst wires and wire your charge port to the black and red wires, or maybe find a mating jst socket and wire your charge port to that.

I've been going a different route with testing loctite 638 & 680, applying drops between the magnets a few at a time, then putting the shaft of the bell into my drill press and spinning it for 5 minutes, wipe, repeat. I generally use an acceleratant at the end to help clean up. My last two sets of motors have come in pre-hardened so I haven't bothered. 

@Andy87 & @Sender have more experience using epoxy. Personally I've not tried it because I feel it's enough material/mass to impact the balance of the can even marginally.

@ShredRedwood to seal the sensors and pcb for waterproofing is always a good idea. I like the way @DerelictRobot does more than using epoxy like I did, but you need to know how to do it right. I tried once with green loctite but didn’t spin the bell up and also didn’t use acceleratant. Means that the loctite not really run under the magnets and just two rides after I did that one motor again broke on me. There also motors where the magnets already glued in. Not well enough but enough to seal the outside of the magnets. In this case the loctite will not work. Epoxing the motor is a messi thing and I hate it, but it’s pretty solid and I do it on all motors I think need it. At the moment I rework my 8085 motors like that. 

I noticed that on your two motors there is one with retaining ring and one without. Are those the same motors?

Yeah, I did the waterproofing part. That was a pretty easy process.   I do have a drill press that I could spin them on. I don't know what acceleratant to use but I would probably be willing to give it a shot. I have the TB 6374 motors, how would I know if they're already glued in already? Doing the epoxy looks like a hell of a process, that's why I'm not sure about that route or not. 

Yeah, they're the same motors. The reason they're open is because the retaining ring had come unglued. I figured while I had one open I might as well do both and waterproof them too. The hardening was a bit of an after thought but if the retaining ring came lose it does make me wonder if I should try to harden them.

[/quote]

As far as I remember the older tb motors not glued at all. If you use loctite it’s important that the loctite can run under the magnets. You can see if there is a small gap between bell and magnet it’s good to go. If there is a sealant in that gap like epoxy it’s not going to work.

I definitely would glue back the retainer ring with some epoxy. Just some drops and put it back.

The problem I see in the epoxy battle harden is that you need the right epoxy consistence to work good with. If it’s too fluent it’s run away if it’s too thick it doesn’t run in all corners. It’s also need a bit a time to get it right so that it’s not stuck on the magnets and will later hit the stator. I had good experience using a 5min epoxy. It’s enough time to fill up 2-3 gaps and remove the epoxy which came on the motors. In case you will do that one day, really get wooden popstickles. They help a lot to remove the epoxy from the magnets as the epoxy stuck to the wood better than plastic or metal.

I would not use silicone, like GE Silicone 2+ on motors.

I use acrylic conformal coating and silicone modified conformal coating.  Remember the silicone modified conformal coating traps heat, so use sparingly on the parts that get hot (windings & stator).

First I use the acrylic conformal coating on the motor sensors and anything else that has exposed metal.  Then I usually wait for it to dry and put a second and third coat on.  You can put it anywhere inside the motor except on the bearings, and it's extremely runny, so don't let ANY of it get in the bearings.

Next after that dries I go over it with silicone modified conformal coating mostly on the sensor assembly and where the phase leads connect to the windings and especially all the sensor wires.

But I am still trying to perfect my process.  I tried to put epoxy on the magnets once and it formed into the magnetic field and started sticking up then flowing onto the magnets so I quickly wiped it off.  I guess JB Weld has actual steel in it.

I only bought them a few months ago but it does look like there's a gap there.  Maybe I'll try a drop of water and see if it flows under in a bit.  

That I can do, diyelectricskateboard is sending me a deeper pressure ring I guess so I'm waiting on that to put everything back together anyway. 

Thanks for the tips for the epoxy route. I definitely like the idea of them being pretty solid but I think I'm gonna save that project for a later date and may try the loctite and drill press route or see what @s5300 has for a plan. I've got a few days to work on it anyway.

Got it.  I kinda realized that was a poor choice after digging deeper. Definitely glad I didn't just wing it. 

I actually picked up the conformal coating after reading one of your posts in a different thread. But didn't realize you used a layer of both on the sensors. so I only ended up ordering the conformal and not the silicone. Should I get the silicone too or is it possible to use just one? 

Hah, I almost grabbed a jb weld to put the pressure ring back in but stopped for that very reason. I saw the package said contains real steal and figured that may be a bad choice. Is there a specific high heat epoxy you'd recommend?

For motor sensors, only the acrylic one is just fine.  I'd apply multiple coats though.

That's the runniest one with the harshest solvent, so make sure it doesn't run into the bearings.  Doesn't matter if it runs anywhere else (within reason)

If you go through the effort to remove the bearings first, you should almost be able to just spray the whole thing, but good luck getting the bearings to seat after that.  I prefer a tiny brush and a steady hand.

Alright cool.  I already have a few coats on the sensors but didn't realize I could essentially put it on everything (other than bearings) so I think I'll take some time and get a few coats on the rest too.  I've got no problem going down the meticulous little brush route but may take out the bearings just to be safe.  I'd rather take my time anyway.

Yeah, it's definitely a deep rabbit hole to go down. Basically from my admittedly limited experience, if you want to print gorgeous photographs and hang them on your wall, go with a high end inkjet, they can do glossies like noone's business. For text and image documents of decent quality and good price, go toner. Yes, the toner cartridges cost more than ink cartridges, but they last a LOT longer before needing replacement.

Brother has several models of LED printer that can print color just as fast as black and white, and a lot faster than most inkjets. 
(It used to be that laser printers could only do b/w, or took like 4x as long to print in color compared to b/w, but the newer ones are much better.)

Laser printers are usually a little bit physically larger than inkjet, but IMO the cost per page outweighs the size difference.

Hm ok. The magnets look good, but I would non the less try if you can lift one or the other magnet up with a screw driver a bit. The sound from the video sounds like there is a scraping point somewhere. Also have a look that you have the washers between the bell and the circle clip so tight that the bell doesn’t have a play anymore. If the motor is mounted and you push the shaft the bell should push back out.

I couldnt say for sure, but anything is better than nothing. I think a collision with a rotating bell might be catastrophic, but if the metal plate takes the hit and scrapes the running motor it would probably just be cosmetic damage to the motor. It would just grind to a stop and scrape the metal plate

Its simple to calculate. Your battery is 6ah. Your charger can charge at a rate of 2a. So you would charge in 3 hours, but this is not really possible with heat loss, inefficiency, and other factors. Add about 20% to that time and you have a reasonable charging time estimate so i would say 3.5 to 4 hours

I'd guess your multimeter and/or charger is not properly calibrated, and thus your batteries are just a tad overcharged. It's certainly not good for them, so I'd recommend going for a quick spin to bring that down to below 50.4. In general, I avoid keeping my batteries (flashlight, phone, laptop, vehicle) at 100% charge. I usually set my chargers to stop around 4.1-4.1-4.15/cell rather than the full 4.20. It improves the lifespan of the cells, and doesn't really cost you much range.

You need to find the coolest engineering prof you can (feel free to ask older engineering students who may know the best target) and see if you can reason with them to sign off on it as a project. Even a typed piece of paper by you that they sign will make most campus  security guards accepting. They are much lower in chain of command than professors. You shouldn't need to hide your pride!

Why do they have an issue with the board if your riding it around the campus as long as you are safe it should be fine.  Its like at a skate park where people are forcing you to wear a helmet and pads.  Yes helmets save lives especially on esk8 because we are capable of speeds greatly higher than you are even capable of  at a skate park.  If someone doesn't want to wear a helmet and you have a sign about wearing a helmet and that person gets hurt they have no one to blame but themselves if the park is maintained.

If you want strength, don't use stainless. Only use stainless if you **need** the corrosion resistance. Stainless has all kinds of issues like galling, and is not worth it for the "ooh, shiny" factor. If at all possible, buy class 10.9 or 12.9 alloy steel fasteners.

I would highly HIGHLY suggest upgrading the esc to a vesc (programmable esc for fine tuning). That esc won't cut your power off until your batteries are way under drained because it thinks you're using a 10s still. It will also allow you to set brake and throttle intensity and responsiveness.

I'm a personal fan of the focbox unity. Dead simple for a first time vesc user, amazing power and features.

I would need wiring for the balance wires for the BMS - 20awg wires seem about right? 

The main wiring for the batteries - 10 awg? 12awg? 

Connectors - I want to be using connectors instead of solid soldering for everything I can. Are there recommendations for this? I guess XT30 and XT60, but with a 10s4p battery pack I'm not sure if the XT60 would be enough?

XT 90s for the battery and adapters to the esc depending on the manufacturers choice.  If you go changing the esc connectors it usually voids the warranty and this includes the phase connectors too.  Use 10awg for the battery wiring.  @b264 has a nice little quick ref guide for wiring but I can't find it.

Be careful with those button head screws - they're stronger, but the hex drive is a size smaller than the cap screws, so you'll be more likely to strip the drive than to break the screw. Using Wera hex-plus wrenches helps a lot, but there's only so much you can do when the drive is smaller. That's why I always recommend cap head screws where possible - much harder to strip them.

You will run into problems with connectors.  8 is big and makes soldering connectors hard.  Also a lot more bulky.  Crimping pins for jst connectors could be problematic on 16 too but don't quote me on that I have never done it.  Make sure the wire is silicon too for flex purposes.

As long as you can fit and solder the wire into the connectors adequately, it should be fine. Like dareno said though, make sure it's silicone insulation, not pvc.

I'm not sure I could tell the difference haha, but these wires seem pretty easily flexible so I assume they're silicone? 

I also have a bunch of what appears to be 12awg speaker wiring. As well as some other lengths of wire that I'm not sure what gauge it is as it's not written on the sheath. Would be nice to be able to make use of some of it instead of buying even more wire!

I would err on the side of caution when using random wire.  Get the stuff that has been tried and tested.  Its just not worth it for a few dollars.  Especially in a battery build.

I mean the 8awg and 16awg are proper wire, it's only the random other ones I'm not sure of. They'll be decent wiring, just thicker.

I would think it's silicone from the feel. Is there a problem with PVC?

Edit: Alternatively I'd just be getting the bog standard 10awg and 20awg from amazon or ebay

One dead easy way to be sure: Take your soldering iron and try to melt/burn the insulation. Silicone won't melt, and won't degrade at all from a 400C iron. PVC will melt and smoke well below that temperature.

I'm looking to print some wheel pulleys foe my Rockstar 2 hubs and I'm trying to decide what the best material would be. I'm looking for something that:

* Is strong enough not to break/crack

* Is not hydroscopic

* Minimal amount of bed warping concern 

The plan is to print at 100 percent infill. I've considered PETG and nylon so far, but im open to suggestions

From my experience, nylon is a little more fussy to print, but results in a wonderfully tough and wear-resistant part. It is a little hygroscopic, but that shouldn't affect its performance as a pulley. PETG can be easier to print, but it's a little more brittle and not quite as tough.

My $0.02, if you can afford it and your printer can handle it, go nylon 100%.

Only do a re detect if you are absolutely certain there is nothing wrong with the motor.  Run a quick hand phase test on it to check theres nothing shorting out in there or you will brick your vesc with a detection.  

Let’s say the phase wires on the motor are A, B, and C

**Disconnect them from the ESC**

Touch A+B together. Verify the motor has choppy brakes

Touch A+C together. Verify the motor has choppy brakes

Touch B+C together. Verify the motor has choppy brakes

Touch A+B+C together. Verify the motor has SMOOTH brakes that are much stronger

All the choppy brakes should feel the same. If one is weaker or stronger or if anything isn’t as described above, it means you might have winding issues.

If you can, add 8mm washers to the axle to move the wheels out. Then put the nylock nut on backwards to make sure its fully threaded. It has to be a new nylock and needs to grip atleast 2 metal threads. Its risky, but it works for some people


Edit, it should be as tight as possible without breaking stuff

@ZachTetra @Dirt_Bag  You can also get other forms of locking nuts than nylock, and don't need that extra couple mm of engagement, such as flex-top and distorted-thread locknuts. McMaster has several flavors in stock, and I'm sure you could find other suppliers and styles. They're commonly used where either the service temperature (or environmental effects) would degrade the nylon insert, or where even tougher locking and vibration resistance is required. (I used them on aerospace hardware.)

Hell, some tough threadlocker and a regular nut will do as long as you make sure everything is clean and wait the recommended time for it to set up properly.

Also @BruSkater a good indication that your belt is aligned perfectly, is that you can hand-turn it forward and watch which side the belt moves to -- and if you then hand-turn it reverse and the belt goes to the opposite side, then it's not quite perfectly aligned.  It might work, but it's better if you can get it perfect.  That's usually indicating the clamp on the hanger might not be perfectly perpendicular.

Yes, I realized that, and in fact it moves around depending the direction, but I find it quite difficult to align the clamp, I did all I could, but when you tight the screws physics is just going to do its thing and move the clamp a bit.... But the misalignment seems minor, hope that is not a problem....

But getting to the original question, is there a problem to have the belt so close to the wheel @b264?

I don't think it matters.  If you don't have a higher-voltage battery handy, a 9V battery will work.  Just don't run the motors on that.

Either way, the DRV8302 is still only giving 5V to the low-voltage parts.

Sensors are not that important especially on a binding equipped board.  A small hip flick is all that is required.  All the vesc needs is direction.  Sk3 are without a doubt the best motors I have ever used.  The sk8 are exactly the same internally but I think they cheaped out on the sensors but have fixed that now.

They still suck compared to Maytech. Heavy, big, low powered and overheat easily.

They do have keyways on both sides of the shaft though and are cheap.

Probably not. I would rather have maytech 6374 than sk8 6374 even if I had to go for 170 or 190kv over 149kv (which is my preference for my mtb)

What about the MayTech 6355 170kv?  It’s what I already have and it will definitely fit

Magic kv is actually 170kv to account for the increased rolling friction of pneumatics

Total system weight is 70kg, I want to make a longboard with big pneumatics and massive acceleration 

Current plan is 8” pneumatics on TB 218s; I already have a Unity, 40” drop deck longboard, pair of MayTech 6355 170kv sealed motors, and the parts for a 12s4p 30Q pack 

I’m thinking 14:72 gearing which puts me at 25mph nominal voltage with 75% efficiency

[quote="SemPorter, post:6616, topic:9559"]
Hello, I have this Li Ion battery of a hoverboard (new condition [https://imgur.com/a/ebDjDsV ](https://imgur.com/a/ebDjDsV) ) is it possible to use this one to power a eboard? If so, would I just be connecting the XT60 to the ESC of the board or am I supposed to do this otherwise. Also how would one be charging this bms? I only see a P-, but don’t I also need a P+ to charge it? Would I be able to charge it with a charger like this? https://hobbyking.com/en_us/imax-b6-50w-5a-charger-discharger-1-6-cells-genuine.html

Quick comparison.

I have tried sealed maytech 6355, 6374 both 190kv and sk8 6374 149kv.

There is no discernible difference between the 6355 and 6374 maytechs when set at the same amps. There is a big difference however in how fast they overheat.

When I had my Evo setup with 6355 they would overheat when on my way back home from work to the point I would have to get off the board and let them cool to continue.\
Now with the 6374 it is the focboxes that overheat and I end up having to do the exact same thing :rofl: . I have plans for an aluminium plate to help cool them though so this should be sorted.

When I had the 6374 maytechs on my Trampa that thing was a beast. Eventually they did overheat though whereas the vesc6 were at 45C (a part of this is due to better vesc placement).

When I changed to the 6374 sk8 149kv, I lost power and torque :thinking: . The sk8 are smoother though but on a MTB with bindings that is not so important.

I have a flexy deck and now that I have mounted my home made battery enclosure of fiberglass I've lost flex which I bet is transfering to my enclosure. I don't know how to really fix this but I think using springs on the screws and some foam on the edge will solve a bit of my problem. Do you guys have any other ideas to get my flex back?

Make a flexy enclosure, or a multipart enclosure with flexible joints, or more than one smaller enclosure.

In general, flex is the antithesis of a reliable esk8 build unless you specifically design around it from the beginning.

I have heard that about the 149kv sk8.  Trust me the 192's are powerful.  Very much so.  @mynamesmatt will attest.  The bullshit says 4000w and the same bullshit for the sk3 says 3500w
There is a marked difference in torque.  Nothing top end according to the speed gun but definitely more low down grunt which makes them feel faster.  I actually prefer the sk3 for the acceleration curve.  Sk3 are much cooler running too.  I can scream around for a full charge in 40 degrees and they stay below the cut offs.  Sk8 did overheat once on me and that was on 10s which was strange but thats esk8

Yeah looks great. 
It’s rectangular and black. It has wires to connect to something. A button you could press. A display you could read. 

Here’s another good idea. 
Use the search button. Read everything you can find on this forum even if it’s unrelated to what you’re looking for. It might be relevant to you later and it’s fun to learn if you’re interested. 

Also when you want to refer to something you might want to show us more than just a picture and also explain what your intentions are or what you’re looking for. 

If you’re not sure, more information is always better than less. 

Considering your efforts so far, I’d say buy that ownboard or ownboard kit. That will be enough for you for now to enjoy. 

I bought a Meepo in 2017 and was very happy with it. It soon became clear to me that I want to keep eskating and do more reading and build my own board. 
I loved that Meepo. It got me where I am today.

Hi,

Could I use Ikea ebike battery for a setup?
![20190508_184048|690x203](upload://4TJ2GJycWe1fZjSg13DbPTrsKle.jpeg)

One problem I think could be an issue is the discharge? I'm not sure and there could be other problems I'm not addressing. 

Thanks for reading 😅

I can't find anything spec wise with regard to cell type and discharge rates.  Main problem usually with repurposing ebike batteries is size.  This one looks like a drop tube bolt on affair and it uses liion not lifepo.  Which means it won't be some great big heavy monster.  Do some more research on cell type and give it a go.  One thing I could discover was that that bike has been discontinued in a lot of countries and it was spectacularly slow  but that could all be in the controller to circumvent ebike laws in europe.  Let us know how you get on.  Interesting stuff.

Thats the ownboard kit hes linked and while its nothing special, it is backed up very well by them and the esc is a hobbywing made unit which makes it far from garbage, just low amp rated and underwhelming.

I'm having a bit of trouble figuring out how the motor sprocket fits on to the keyway'd motor shaft. I did some searching and realized the small metal tab should go in the keyway, but do the grub screws also need to be tightened down? If so I need a smaller hex key, 2mm is too big. 10mm shaft 10mm ID bore.

How does this thing go on without spinning freely?

In theory the closer you get to the hangar being vertical (90 degrees), the less mechanical advantage you have. So since yours are pretty close to 90 (45+20), you'll have a hard time overcoming the stiffness of the bushings. I'd recommend either getting some adjustable-angle trucks (I've seen them on here, but can't find them right now), or getting/making some angle blocks to cancel out some or all of that extra 20 degrees.

Ideally you'd want to have a key installed like @b264 mentioned to prevent rotation, and have the setscrew tightened down to prevent any side-to-side movement. Loctite is an option but not recommended on its own.

If you don't already own one, I strongly recommend acquiring a set of allen wrenches, specifically the Wera hex-plus ones. They're pricey, but absolutely worth every penny.

Yah I stripped a bolt on my other board so I'm gonna sacrifice a key from my set and some JB weld to get it out. Definitely looking into the Wera hex +, and they're not too costly. Heck, I paid half that at Lowes for these junk allen keys and the small ones suck pretty hard.

If the JB weld trick doesn't work, you can try hammering a slightly oversized torx driver into the stripped socket. That should cut its own grooves into the screw and allow you to back it out.

I'm not saying it can't be a workable solution. But from my own personal experience, even loctite 680 sleeve retainer can fail, and has for me on wheel pulleys in the past, which is why I don't use it in that application anymore and thus it is **not recommended** in my book. I will always use either a key or a setscrew on a flat.

Besides, if it's so easy to do it wrong, then maybe it shouldn't be the one-stop go-to solution for noobs, whereas a key in a keyway is pretty much idiot-proof.

For example, we have Li-ion battery **12S6P** (3.7V 2500mah per cell)

* Voltage: 12 cells * voltage = 12 * 3.7V = 44.4V
* Capacity: 6 packs * capacity = 6 * 2.5Ah = 15Ah
* Watt-hours: Ah * Voltage = 15Ah * 44.4V = 666Wh

We have VESC which can provide 12S 35A with no heating.
So it can give us 44.4V * 35A = 1554W of power continuous.

Doesn't it mean that under this load VESC can completely discharge 12S6P battery for **26 mins** (666Wh / 1554W * 60mins) ??

I'm pretty sure I'm wrong in calculation but can't get where.. But if not..
only 26mins?

You are correct, if you draw that 35A continuously, you only get 26min before you're spent. Luckily for you, that 35A is a maximum, not a constant - most of the time while cruising, you'll be using like 5-10A at most.

I still can't link it with a range and speed.
12S6P is huge battery, and according to info by @Clonkex 666Wh give us nearly 67 km of range because average consumption is 10wh/km. Then 50Amp should fully cover all our power and speed needs. Isn't it?

But if it is, i don't get why people like dual motors and VESC with 80A continuous at 12S. it's about 8000W total power. Suitable battery will be 12S16P (192 cells) and it is just for 13 mins full throttle.

What the difference in speed at 10A and at 50A on the road with no hills? I mean if change gear ratio.

@Drom  Because with these motor controllers, "full throttle" is not always synonymous with "full current." 
Think of your car - Cruising down the highway at 70mph, are you using full throttle? No. Because even though you might have an engine capable of producing 500 horsepower, it only takes about 30-80 horsepower to cruise on the highway at 70mph.

The reason you want dual vescs at 80A is the same reason you'd prefer to drive a 500hp sportscar compared to a 100hp honda civic - acceleration. Sure, a civic can cruise at 70mph just as well as a sportscar , but you'll take a lot longer to reach that speed. It's also the reason it's harder to pass on the freeway with a gutless car - You have very little power left over for acceleration to pass, whereas a sportscar might still have 420 horsepower to spare, where your civic only has 20hp left over.

The difference in speed between 10A and 50A with no hills with gear ratio adjusted so you reach that current draw at your maximum possible RPM is significant. But either way, it'll be an incredibly shitty ride because your acceleration from a standstill will be so slow.

Conversely if you have them geared for the same speed, the 50A setting will feel amazing, because while they'll both **eventually** reach the same speed, the 50A one will do it in a small fraction of the time. 

The 50A setting and the 10A will also consume the same power at top speed. You only need the extra 40A for **acceleration**.

It's also worth mentioning more current = more heat, which (aside from battery limitations) is the main reason we can't just pump 500A through our ESCs and motors. It's all a balancing act. You can often push way more current through a motor than it's rated for on a cold day, because it won't get too hot and melt something.

I have no idea why Brian said that.  Never had an interference issue with the receiver being near the battery.  He may have been referring to potential damage from the battery moving.  Its just something I've always done and it works for me.  Its the coolest place too so it kind of made sense to keep it away from all the other electronics.  I have big discharge bms's in my builds too and they get warm.

What I'm saying is that if you briefly lose your remote signal, you only lose one half of the drive train instead of the whole thing, which is less likely to toss you off the skate.

Also, if one drive train malfunctions, both can go down if it's the one supplying the receiver power.

Dual receivers is better in almost every way.

@Sn4pz I said that because in a crash you don't want the receiver next to the battery because it's the heaviest part and so will crash against the side of the enclosure the hardest.  You don't want a little receiver in between them

It fucked the back truck and one mount.  Destroyed the bearings in one wheel.  Put some pretty big dings in the board and ruined matts x thingys but the enclosure and innards were fine.  Alans enclosure is one tough cookie.  I used heavy density open cell packing foam, shitloads of industrial velcro and m5 steel bolts holding it all together.  The deck/enclosure on that set up is a weapon.  Any of my other set ups would have been toast for sure.

You can't just add length to an antenna and expect it to work. The length is specific to the transmitter frequency. If you need to extend it, you need a coaxial cable or other form of transmission line. 

I can teach you how to do this correctly if needed, it's not hard, but you can't just add a wire and have it  behave correctly.

I'm looking for single-wire connector options, for things like plugging my BMS into the B- line of the battery. I don't want to solder a single wire in place, as it'll mean having to desolder it if I ever need to remove anything. So I was going to solder a wire on both ends, and then have a connector (like an XT90) in the middle. Except I only need a single plug, so wondered if there was a standard for that? 

Bullet connectors were my first obvious thought, but they aren't very sturdy and I don't want them popping apart mid-ride.

No in fact you will now have 2 switches on your board (bms &unity ) you can eliminate the bms one by soldering the 2 wires from the bms together however the switch on the bestech also acts as a reset button for the bms. I think @Namasaki can elaborate on the cons (if There are any) of bypassing the bestech eswitch.

I can tell you that if the BMS fully disconnects the battery, you will lose brakes. Not sure if a missing balance wire will cause a full disconnection (charge and discharge), or just the discharge portion. (This is all assuming a not-bypassed BMS. If your BMS is bypassed, it won't be able to stop you from drawing current from the battery.)

**Battery Mounting Help**

I have a 10s4p battery pack that is^h^h was mounted under my deck with 3M Dual Lock tape. I then had screwed a plastic enclosure around it, made from a plastic drawer organizer.

Well, it all fell apart. As best I can figure, after a ride on some cracky asphalt or a few too many bumps, the Dual Lock gave way and the battery dropped. The battery hitting the enclosure was enough that it cracked and it all ended up on the ground.

How do you experts affix your batteries to your deck? I'm considering something more aggressive like a metal strap.

Careful with metal, if it shorts across the p-packs you're in for a world of trouble, make sure there are no sharp edges and the metal is WELL insulated

I think the standard is using some heavy duty Velcro to hold the battery up and filling the space around with foam to hold it against the Velcro, also stronger enclosures that won't crack under stress

Thinking of buying an smart BMS for my 12s3p setup. 
Does the discharge rate matter? If the discharge rating is 20A, does it mean that BMS is able to drain the batteries at 20A? If yes, how can such a small board handle this and where would the heat go? 

Do I need more than 20A for charging ? Even If I charge at 1C, I would only need 9A for my 12s3p.

Thank you, I understand. After inspection, the enclosure failed because it was only attached to the deck at 4 points, and they were weak. I'll re-do the enclosure with a full-length flange for screws, instead of 4 tabs. I've also increased the amount of 3M Dual Lock holding the battery up.

I like the idea of some foam to give the battery a little extra support. It would reduce the amount of shock load on the enclosure if the battery were to come loose. 

Thanks!

The current rating is the amount that can pass through the BMS, not the amount the BMS can dissipate on its own. Most BMSs can dissipate between 20 and 200 milliamps per cell. 

If you want to use your BMS for discharge, then the current rating of your BMS should match the maximum discharge capability of your battery. For a 12s3p of (I'm assuming) 30Q cells, that would be 60A.

Yes, if a balance lead disconnects, the bms will go into protection mode and cut power to the vesc so you would simply coast to a stop.

For your setup running 12 gauge wires shouldn’t be big a problem. They might get toasty after climbing some hills but should be good. If they get too hot, like that you can’t hold your fingers on them, then it’s time to change them to 10 awg. One other restriction/problem could be the connector. From what I see that looks like an XT-60 and aren’t rated for high amps. Consider using Xt-90 for your main connection such as from the Vesc to batteries

The limiting factor on what the max wire gauge is being able to get it in between the BMS layers, currently it's the only way I'm getting everything to fit right...hurting for space as always.  I think I can get 13awg to go through the e-switch but probably not 12 and definitely not 10

Do the Unity wires and connectors usually get hot?

Hi, I have two questions

1) I'm building a 12S3P 18650 pack for a dual motor(6355-190kv)  setup. I can buy LG HG2 for $3.5/cell. Samsung 30Q is a little cheaper but it provides 5A less than HG2. Which one should I get? 

2) I'm planning to install both motors on the back. Would you guys recommend installing one on front and one on back ?

You mean dual diagonal?  Its only real benefit is extreme traction in snow, rain, et cetera.  (You still have one wheel on each truck steering even if the drive wheels are skidding)  Also sometimes it allows you to use narrow trucks with huge motors.  Sometimes it means you will have torquesteer though.

If you do that, rear heelside and front toeside

Looking for some explanation...

I had a motor crap out on me, so I am on a single motor for now. I've limited my (now) single focbox to 60A battery and 80A motor.

I used to draw 78 battery amps on dual with 40/40+80/80 batt/motor. Now I draw 46 battery amps on single.

I've only tested it around the parking lot and plan to test more tonight to see if 60 battery amps is hit at some point...

But, why do I not hit 60 battery amps when riding single? I'm assuming it could be the XT60 connector, maybe something with the motor, or maybe something to do with how vescs work... Just curious if anyone has an easy explanation why I might not be seeing full amp draw at full throttle on single drive vs dual.

Edit: wattage limit. Nevermind

I charged a 10s2p and left it on the charger for about an hour after "fully charged" to ensure balancing was being done. Was only reaching 4.18

I disconnected the balance terminals and tested the p cells:

1. 4.22
2. 4.22
3. 4.18
4. 4.16
5. 4.16
6. 4.17
7. 4.19
8. 4.19
9. 4.19
10. 4.17

After a few hours the cell will balance down to a nominal voltage of 40.8

Any clues what is happening here? Just a shitty BMS? Maybe cells 1 and 2 are under capacity from the rest of the cells? Is there any more test I can do besides breaking down the whole pack and measuring the capacity of each cell?

That's not waterproofing.

That's preventing water ingress -- aka making it water resistant.  That's good -- but it's not as good as waterproofing, and they are best combined together.  "Waterproof" means your whole enclosure and motors and everything can be full of water in a river and it still works.

Typically that's acheived by putting acrylic conformal coating all over all things

You can get thread inserts like this ![image|500x500](upload://6WTr2caP7k7x7sZtxbmcCZ6CagL.jpeg)  
that go in from the bottom, which will solve your ugly griptape problem. If you have a drill press or another way to drill to a specific depth, you might even be able to avoid having any holes that go all the way through to the top surface.

Those are available in many different styles for hard and soft wood, from many different sellers - be careful choosing the right ones.

"big enough" is relative, and depends on how many you use. I prefer M4, and for my enclosure (enclosure bearing full weight of electronics), I had them spaced out every 3-4" or so all around the perimeter. If you go with M3, you'll need a lot more to get the same strength.

I got half way though my balance leads before I realized this BMS has only 12 leads, do I not connect the positive terminal or the negative terminal? I assume the negative terminal gets skipped since it uses a hard connection for it

This isnt your full battery it only has 24 cells.  A 12s3p would have 36 It is very hard to determine if it is all correct without the whole configuration.There should be a balance wire coming off of if set cells.  This should help you as it is a 12s3p

I may put this in it's own question thread when I get my photos and stuff done, but for now - 

Are there any advantages / disadvantages to which way round you mount the motors? eg either hanging out off the back of the board (behind the rear trucks), or slung underneath the tail of the board in front of the trucks. 

Basically I'm considering making them go underneath, to make the board shorter and more discrete. But it also means less clearance for them, and it might mean having to raise the height of the deck for them to fit. Not sure how much clearance is needed.
```

TBH it's heavily dependant on circumstances and preference...in theory the best is to front mount under the deck with risers but there no right answer

If clearance will be an issue then reverse mount it, if you need the kicktail then forward mount it, assuming you prefer the rear drive
```

## \#7027 Posted by: nirurin Posted at: 2019-05-16T18:21:07.532Z Reads: 63

I mean I don't currently have a preference for front or rear drive, as I haven't tested it, but it seemed like the consensus on here was rear drive is better so I thought I'd start with that as the plan. Am I wrong on this? 

I'm using bergmeister wheels, so I have big wheels which helps with clearance. But I'm also using a drop through deck, and currently it's actually being mounted that way. However I can easily change to top-mounting the trucks to gain more clearance. 

However I do know that having the deck lower helps with stability, so I'm trying to come up with a good balance. Probably will take some trial and error, but I figured it wouldn't hurt to get some suggestions and feedback on here before I start making the errors!

First thing if you are talking about actual front wheel drive then it will give you a better hill climb ability but less traction in the wet.  Also braking in the wet is very hairy.  In the dry however it will give you more stopping power but this also can be a bit too much.  I have only every used a front drive board with urethane though.  One thing to consider too is if the board locks a motor then you are flying whether you like it or not.  Sometimes with rear drive if one wheel locks you can ride it out.
Rear drive reverse mount if you want to mount the trucks drop through because you will be able to lift your motors enough to clear the deck in most cases.

So I assembled my first board and gave it a try. It seems incredibly slow, even on flat surface on full throttle. What could be the cause of this? I am a 73 KG rider, with a single 6355 170kv, 10s2p Samsung 30Q and 36 / 15 gearing.

 My vesc settings are:

 60A and -60A motor. 

Battery max 40A. 

Aside from the slow speed, it also had major problems climbing even the smallest incline. However braking was strong and worked very well on all speeds. 

The reasons I could think of:

The battery was really low and therefore could barely supply any power. 

My soldering job on the XT90 connector from the vesc to the battery is bad, which results in it not being able to deliver enough power.

Since the vesc is single, it gets overheated and therefore goes in a sort of cooldown mode. However I rode about 10 minutes, so this is not so likely. 

If you need any more info, to help me figure out the problem. Please let me know.

Your symptoms exactly describe a low battery situation.  Try charging the battery.  With a low battery, you will still have killer brakes but your forward acceleration will be seriously lacking, until at some point you need to kick-push.

Well technically its from DickyHo but its the same ESC, I needed something cheap and hassle free so I could get on the road ASAP; next build is running Unity so once this dies I'm on to VESCs only.  The battery voltages are all perfect and the wheels free spin cleanly, its not an overheating issue either since it was sitting for a while.  The remote has 4 LEDs to return the battery voltage and it stayed at 4/4 to 2/4 so the sag isn't an issue.  It was damp this morning so maybe water damage?

 pic >

 ![20190516_190340|690x335](upload://3sn1sOw58YqbfJgSPcMYQBU8ipt.jpeg) 

Should I slice the shrink wrap a little and solder it again? What techniques are available for this kind of situation? I can solder decently well, I just dont know if theres a 'best' way to attack this.

Secondly, When opening my board after about 8 miles ( I want to bump the vescs up to 12a each), I noticed some paint on the balance wire spots within the pack... Its certainly not burnt, the black paint has just rubbed off.

I have a bamboo deck ( Loaded Vanguard flex 3) . I'm thinking of Drilling a hole to run a flat copper wire from the battery casing to the top of the deck and then run it under the grip tape to reach the VESC case on the other side of the deck. 
To have the copper wire flushed to the board, I'd need to carve a thin path along the board. Should I be worried about the board durability?

It should spin the same way sensored or non, but the speed controller will almost certainly freak out if it's configured for sensors and then suddenly doesn't have them.

I know if you don't redo your sensor detection after swapping phase wires, the vesc freaks out and will refuse to spin the motor - just vibrates loudly in place.

What behavior you expect from a sensored motor where the sensor is slightly loose and occasionally disconnects? I’m pretty sure the default direction w/o sensor is backwards

I would change that to run in unsensored mode immediately.  Learn the hip-flick -- to start from a stop without kick-pushing.

How are people connecting up multiple large-gauge wires? This is for the junction of power wires, where the battery, vesc and charger port wires all meet. So that's 3x 10awg wires that need to connect up, preferably with bullet connectors or something similar so it can all be unplugged when needed. 

Seems like it should have an obvious solution, but I'm failing to find the bullet junction blocks that I would use for smaller wires like 20awg. So far the only solution I've found for 10awg wire is to just solder them all together in a big blob, which is not the solution I want to use!
```

The charger port does not need to be a 10awg wire unless you're planning to charge at 80A.

No, but it does still need to junction to the main 10awg power line (at least according to the standard wiring diagram I am following from here...). 

So sure the charger wire can be smaller, but I'd still need a 10awg/10awg/16awg junction (or whatever I use for charger). 

Worryingly, I had got the idea for using 10awg from this site as I was generally told 12awg would be enough, but I decided to overengineer it a little and go with 10awg. Except now I learn that 10awg max safe amperage is 55amps, and my battery is 60amp max output. Not sure where this has gone awry.

```
The ampacity rating of a wire changes based on the temperature rating of the insulation and the maximum allowable voltage drop across the length of the wire. Silicone-insulated 200C 10AWG wire is good for about 120-130A, whereas regular Romex or whatever house-rated wire is only 60C, and is good to only 30A.

For a regular charging brick of 2-8A, 18-20AWG is fine.
As for connecting, if possible I'd just solder the small wire onto the pads where you soldered the big wire. 
If you don't have pads, but instead have a connector, you may be able to jam both the 10awg and smaller wire into that and solder them together that way.
```

## \#7082 Posted by: b264 Posted at: 2019-05-18T04:44:08.106Z Reads: 69

This is all true to some extent.

I'd like to add that I normally try to err on the side of caution and don't exceed [these ratings](https://www.powerstream.com/Wire_Size.htm) -- which does put 10AWG at 55A continuous, 110A burst

You can use smaller wire but the losses and heating will be more, of course.

So I finally got everything hooked up and running!
It's pretty awesome when you see your motors spin for the first time...... Especially when they are 2 x bkb 6374's that sound like freaking jet engines. 

Anyway, quick question...
I've got a nano-x (yes I know they aren't amazing) but should it be configured in the BLCD tool in the 'fast mode' when setting the limits. Or does it not matter?

Today at work it's dawned on me that I might be setting the min and max at the "reduced speed" rather than the race spec or whatever it's called.

(I'll need the slow mode on this thing - being my fist board) 

Edit: to clarify I'm referring to the toggle speed modes on the remote

Cheers.

Mountainboard trucks usually are either zero degree, or adjustable. The angle comes from the deck, rather than the baseplate like skateboard trucks.

That's why if you want to run mtb trucks on a regular board, or regular trucks on a mtb, you need angled risers to either add in or remove angle to get the correct geometry.

If you don't have any angle blocks, the angle of the trucks (RKP or TKP) will add together with the angle of the deck, and you'll end up with something that barely turns at all when you put your weight on it.

I feel like unsoldering it could be dangerous, it’s supposed to be a sensitive thermal measurement part, PCB is just a brick of silicon and should therefore be more tolerant to tampering

What would be the recommendation for cutting?  I can file it since it’s thin or use a Dremel with a fiber cutting wheel

I see. To my understanding (take it for what its worth), is that the sensitive part of the thermal probe is the top bit that is screwed into the heatsink. 

For cutting, i would use a fine anything with low pressure when cutting (basically anything to reduce the strain on the PCB), but maybe someone else has a better reccomendation.

The thermally sensitive part is where it's bolted to the heatsink. Desoldering the wires at their other end will be totally fine.

You can cut PCB with nippers, a fine tooth hack saw, or a dremel tool. Just be careful to avoid exposure to the fiberglass dust, and be aware that any non-abrasive tool will be dulled fairly quickly.

It makes the enclosure at least 65mm tall, street and hybrid boards just don't have the clearance.  It works for the Baja and its technically more space efficient but it's also harder to implement flex into the pack and get the wires to sit in a neat bundle.  It does make the welding more consistent though, all the nickle sits flat at each end

It would be okay if you use the side of the enclosure for strength instead of the deck so you could trim off some weight and get some bigger wheels

You have a bad bearing if the torque on the axle does not affect the rotation of the wheel.  Without or indeed with a short spacer as you tighten the wheel the two inner races will compress and put pressure on the outer thereby causing friction and slowing down the rotation.  Always better to ride with a larger spacer than a shorter and definitely don't ride with no spacers.

Hi, I just upgraded to 6380 170kv motors from TB and I use a Unity in a 10s4p setup. These motors could not be programmed with the unity Android app. Someone more knowledgeable than me said it was due to their size and that programming them via the PC version of the VESC tool would solve it and he was right. Now the issue is that the motors cog a bit on starup. This same person said something along the lines of "raise your erpm" but I can't remember what exactly. What should I do to stop this cogging? I left everything on default settings btw.

I mean you should get the 'proper parts', but you do you man.  There is no right or wrong way to make eskates, just personal preferences

If you are willing to wait 2 weeks for international shipping, Caliber II trucks and a longboard deck can be found on eBay for $30 each.  You will need different wheels with spoked cores anyways, and those are another $20.  You can get mounts for $20 each so it won't save you money to use that longboard, however it may bring some extra work

@ZachTetra I wouldn't recommend that method - Threads always have some play, and the holes in the trucks that you've driven your screws into will get looser and looser as they wear out, and eventually the screws will fail or the aluminum of the truck or mount will. 

@Rasta Building up a board with caliber or similar trucks will definitely be more expensive, but the result will be far better. If those trucks end up working, then great! If not, you can always pony up and buy better trucks and better mounts down the line when the first ones break. 

It's a matter of your personal build philosophy - do you make a cheap proof of concept first and then fix its issues, or but once, cry once?

if the threads go through the deck than it should be an easy thing. just lay the enclosure out and mark the spots through the thread holes.

if no, it would meassure the distance between the holes out.

depending on how good the threads placed before it´s more or less easy.

I usually fuse the positive wire, but either is fine. You only need to cut one or the other, and WHATEVER you do, don't short the cutters across anything - They should only ever be in contact with one wire and your hand.

@farnamweb Use a fuse on the charge port. It's a $5 (at most) addition, and may save you the price of a new BMS in the future.

It really depends on your exact model of BMS - they're all a little different. 

@Sn4pz I've never noticed a difference. Any decent power supply or charger should have adequate protection and safety features to handle either with no issues.

Honestly the ones you linked will work fine. Just being technical. If you have access to epoxy, id put a dab of it on the **outside** threads of the insert to make sure they stay in. 

1) let them fully cure before inserting bolts

2) don't get any epoxy inside the insert


Instead of trying to remember every drill bit size for every application, learn this one rule of thumb:

![choosing-a-drill-bit-size|500x500](upload://1uYotAAF77DPPDKMRXBfaRalG1U.jpeg)

In your case, the shank is still the insert minus the threads. If you don't have a perfect matched bit, use a slightly smaller one.

don´t solder your pack. use the search button and get some information about how to build a proper pack. there is a ton of information here. if you at the point that you think you know everything, present your strategie here and people can help you to find out if it´s the right way to how to do it.

you really should understand by your own what you doing if you want to build your own battery pack. it´s no super difficult, but it´s also easy to burn down your house if doing something wrong.

some start help would be to read through this:

I know a hex head m4 is a 7mm key but not sure about the bit size. I would use stainless steel as you are less likely to strip the threads in the [inserts](https://www.amazon.com/Tapping-Thread-Insert-Slotted-Helical/dp/B07CBYVLNZ/ref=pd_sbs_263_7?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=B07CBYVLNZ&pd_rd_r=f58fc0c6-7e21-11e9-b5fd-65c62fe45754&pd_rd_w=zt9Cp&pd_rd_wg=VKP8E&pf_rd_p=588939de-d3f8-42f1-a3d8-d556eae5797d&pf_rd_r=QESBADEYRBCRXBEAG2B2&psc=1&refRID=QESBADEYRBCRXBEAG2B2).

If you start to see the wood buldge up I would back out the insert and drill it to the next size up.  Not the next size you have in the bit set but the actual next bit up.  It shouldn't be a problem with the fine threaded inserts but can be for the corse.

Anyone have any tips for drilling holes in the side of a pelican case for female xt90 plugs?

This is also a concern of mine.

I make holes with a file the exact shape of the male XT90 and use JB Weld to secure them.  I have 4 so far and none have broken loose.  You have to be very meticulous in how you do it, though, and you have to give the epoxy a FULL 30 hours to cure and do it in about 5 coats, ensuring it's mixed very well and in the proper ratio.  The first time is just 3 tiny drops to tack it in place, then wait 30 hours....

The part in the case should be male (like this:)![image|690x325](upload://sP8XTYZL51iTFN5GLnYUckKYg7v.jpeg) that way if the spark arrestor fails, it's in the key, not glued into the board.

That said, if I were to do it again I'd 3d print a holder, glue the xt90 into it, then screw the holder to the case. I can bang one out in fusion if you want (assuming one doesn't already exist, I haven't looked.)

Those holders exist, but I stopped using them.  I like epoxying directly to the enclosure. (and inside, epoxy the charge fuse on top of it)

But, you have to use/mix the epoxy correctly, be meticulous, wait a long time for cure, and do a good job, paying attention to detail.  If you do that, it will not come loose.  If you half-ass it, no guarantees ;-P

Hello,

I want to make a 10s4p battery but unfortunately in my country (Argentina) the BMS is not reached to load / download the package correctly. It occurred to me if it is possible to divide the package into two of 5s2p each with a [5-cell BMS](https://articulo.mercadolibre.com.ar/MLA-717305700-placa-proteccion-bms-para-345-baterias-li-ion-18650-100a-_JM) and put it in parallel to turn it into a 10s4p one. Is it possible? Would it work well?

P.D: The load would be carried out by placing two independent ports in the enclosure.

I've got this type of BMS
![Untitled|690x301](upload://v8WbOuQOcyB1DRwhBrONDqiwH3L.png) 
And I need to extend the cable that leads to the P groups of my battery.
I guess I could just cut the wires and solder in an extension but I would rather just buy a premade cable.

Any idea of what type of cable I should buy, or maybe how I could figure out what exactly I'm looking for?

It is lost likely a jst style of connector. You could measure the pin spacing and relate that to which jst connector you need (xh, eh, ph, etc is the common nomenclature)

Well at least now i know what to look for. I found a table of the different JST connectors on wikipedia and I think it’s JST PA or JST PH… I measured the distance between the first and last pin and it seems to be about 2cm, so that would be 2mm pin to pin distance I guess. The whole connector is about 2.3cm

How do I distinguish between the two? Preferably without unplugging the cable, I’m not sure if it’s safe to do that without soldering the other connection to the battery.

edit: It's seems like it's actually a little bit less than 2mm and I didn't take into account that the actual pins themselves also have some thickness... So maybe it's JST ZH...

Another edit: Okay... I'm reading the datasheets right now and it's definitely not JST ZH. the whole connector is about 2.5cm. JST PA and PH have a center to center of pin of 2mm, plus 1.9mm on each side of the connector. so that's probably it.

Well I have a gift for you friend  

I made some press-fitting mounts to hold xt90 connectors and boy are they tight. I'm obviously going to add something like e6000, JB Weld, or epoxy but already I highly doubt it's even needed since the press fit is so strong.  

It takes several times more force to insert/remove the plugs than to insert/remove the cables AND there's a guard on the back of it to prevent it ever being pushed into the case.

Why two though?  If you're using loopkey and charge, then charge needs to be XT30 or XT60.  That way the loopkey can't be accidentally put in the wrong hole.  Humans make mistakes.  Also ensure you [fuse](https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/576-099707.5WXN) the charge port.  And yes, that mistake has happened before by very competent folk.

My board has been draining faster lately. Maybe it's just my perception since I am no longer using my onboard boost converter to charge while riding (amazing never having a dead battery, but that's beside the point). 

I thought to check and see if I have a dead P group, since last time I charged it, it only charged to 92%, and I had it on the charger for a day and a half or more. 

All of the P groups were at 3.76v +/- 0.005v except for one P group which was at 3.85v. 

All the instances I see of cells drifting (I thought), its usually a P group that's lower. What do you guys think could be causing this, and has anyone seen one P group persistently higher than the rest?

It's got a supower 10S BMS. All readings were taken from the BMS balance connector on the BMS itself.

To fix this drift, should I just leave the board on and see if it balances just having the loop key in (EDIT: nevermind, says it balanced when cells reach 3.9v+, may just charge it up a bit and then let it balance)... should I leave it plugged in for a few days and let the BMS do it's work with the charger in, or is 0.1v+ too much of a difference for the supower BMS to handle, or should I manually discharge that P group a bit and then charge it up?
```

I think leaving it charging is a good starting point.  My 12s does this every 10 charges or so but it hovers around 95% for ages then shows 100 but stays red.  Fan stays on and the bms heats up.  Eventually it goes green and is good.  Try it first before you think about a strip down.

I'd just leave it charging for longer. Most BMSs have a pretty low balancing current (50mA isn't uncommon) so a large imbalance like that can take many hours or days to correct, depending on the capacity.

I wouldn't. 4mm bullets aren't that large so their current carrying capacity is limited, and that style of bullet connector (with the separate spring) is especially not great for high current.

I'd go with 5.5mm bullet connectors. Much beefier and most are a one-piece design without a separate spring.

(The spring adds another set of contact points and more chance for a high resistance connection, not good.)

The unity comes with 3.5mm connectors, and I'm building my rig with MR60's which are 3.5mm. He should be completely fine with them.

Maytech 6374 170kv are only rated for max 65A discharge. 3.5mm bullets are 30/piece I believe.

I don't totally disagree, but there are two points that would make me avoid them: 

1: bigger = better when it comes to wire and connectors unless you can't physically fit them.


2: the bullets with the separate springs have a known and documented tendency to make shitty or intermittent contact.

3.5mm solid bullets like the ones on MT60s are better IMO than 4mm or 5mm ones with separate springs.

That battery is simply enourmous and too big to fit on your board. With only 6s it will be extremely underwhelming.

If you go with 2 pf those to make 12s, you would obv need 2x the space. Splitting turnigy lipos is  impossible as well. The cells are glued together with permanent adhesive. You will break the fragile pouch and have a massive fire. Lipos in general should be avoided. They dont have the lifespan of an 18650 and they are much more dangerous

Is it harder on the vesc to use foc sensorless compared to sensors? 

I blew the drv on my brand new Flipsky 4.20 yesterday. 
I ordered a 4.12 off eBay for $30 less then the 4.20 on Flipsky’s site, I would have tried to warranty it but sadly I damaged the USB port when it fell from my test ride and their site states no mechanical damage for warranty. 

I’m dense and want to try the 4.12 in foc sensorless as well 😂 even though I know very well I should just run bldc.

Thats an old lead acid 12v thing.   2 together I'm guessing.   If you want like for like then look at 12v motorcycle batteries or if you want to upgrade it completely then you could chuck 2 3s lipos in there.  Then the motor controller will blow probably.  Then you can put in a 6s car esc.  Wait have we gone back to 2014?  In the scheme of things that old tech is probably not worth throwing money at to be honest

I was only finding it amusing because this how this odyssey started for me.  An old lead acid battery powered esk8.  I chucked dollar after dollar into it and it did turn out to be fun but for the money?  No way.  Easiest way forward is to go lipo and connect them in series with a ready made loom from somewhere like Hobbyking.  All you would have to do then is change the connector on the esc.  At least you will then have something you can use in a future build and it will be fun.

Yes thats possible.  You won't need to do any clever vesc tool shenanigans.  The sensored motor will turn the non sensored and as such give it direction.  Sensors only tell the vesc what direction the motor is spinning.  Sensors are unnecessary imho.   Once you learn how to set up correctly you will find that they aren't needed.  I use bldc only and no sensors and I don't have an issue with cogging at all, if you use foc its even easier to set up for smooth set offs.

The setup would get me moving from standstill, that is absolutely certain. However, when I am starting from a dead stop or even rolling slightly backward and immediately apply power to both motors, the unsensored motor will still cog until I reach a certain speed. I would like to avoid this by setting the second vesc such that it only engages if the motor is already moving at a certain speed in the right direction.

The vesc has a soft thermal protection feature - As it nears the danger zone, it will begin reducing its power output until it reaches equilibrium or the maximum allowable temperature, whichever comes first.

Unless you're trying to seriously off road or race, start with 2wd. It's simple to add another 2 motors and a controller later on and will get you rolling sooner.

I blast up hills with a 2wd 10s5p samsung 30q battery. I also off road a good amount. If I ever get hardcore into off road or racing, maybe I'd consider it. Drains your battery much faster running 4 motors.

I'm gonna split this into two possible permutations:

Q1: Is it physically possible to to apply 12S (50 Volts) to the motor immediately from 0 RPM?

A1: Yes, but it will cause a ridiculous initial current draw due to the low resistance of the windings, possibly damaging the motor and/or the controller and/or the battery or BMS.

Q2: Can a Vesc do the above?

A2: I don't know, but I don't think you'd get THAT much more performance, considering the risk to your hardware. Also, with the ridiculous current, you'd saturate your stator (Once saturated, you get very little to no benefit to increased amperage).

I incorrectly formulated the question, I don't gonna make changes, just wanna understand how voltage affects torque from 0 mph.
But as I understand from your answer, the voltage grows gradually until the maximum speed is reached, right?
I bring the question to whether the torque will change at low revs when using different 8S 10S or 12S batteries.

In other words, whether the torque/acceleration will change at low RPM when using different batteries 6S / 12S / 18S with the same current?
```

## \#7421 Posted by: MysticalDork Posted at: 2019-06-12T07:02:04.258Z Reads: 74

```
Voltage does not directly affect torque. Torque in an electric motor is caused by the interaction of magnetic fields, at least one of which is from an electromagnet. The strength of the interaction (and thus torque) is proportional to the strength of the fields, and the strength of an electromagnet is a function of the number of turns of wire, times the number of amps. 

TLDR, more amps=more torque, until you saturate the steel in the stator. Voltage is only there to push the electrons around, generating the current.

The Vesc is usually in current-limiting mode, where it adjusts its output voltage to maintain the output current at or below the maximum set value. When a motor is stopped, the only thing stopping it from drawing infinite current is its own internal resistance (measured in miliohms) and the similarly low internal resistances of the VESC, BMS, wiring, and battery. Thus at low speed if you measure the voltage and current output of the VESC, if it's set at 50 motor amps and you floor it, it will shove 50 amps through the motor, but only like 8 volts. This is because any higher voltage would cause the motor to pass more than 50 amps.

This changes at higher speeds, due to a phenomenon called back-EMF, or generated voltage. As the motor spins, it behaves as a generator, producing a voltage that opposes the input. At some point the back-EMF and the input voltage match each other, and this is the point where the motor will not spin any faster - its maximum speed.  This is why esk8 and other vehicles powered by BLDC motors have a "hard limit" on top speed - it's not about available power like it is in a car, rather it's the point where the motor just will not spin faster because that would cause it to generate electricity rather than consume it.
```

```
An esk8 with a 6s battery, and an esk8 with a 12s battery (and all other hardware and settings identical) will accelerate the same from a dead stop. The 12s will **continue** accelerating for longer, and reach a higher top speed, but the 6s will launch just as hard.

This is the same thing that your battery current setting affects - not **how hard** you accelerate initally, but **for how long** that acceleration persists before tailing off.

Think of motor current as torque, and battery current as maximum horsepower. Raising your maximum horsepower won't necessarily increase your torque at launch, but you'll still win the race because you can keep accelerating longer.

The thing I can't figure out in right now is resistance.

We have Ohm's law: **current = voltage / resistance**

If VESC can handle **100A**, then motor with winding resistance of **0.05 ohm** can start working at **5 volts** (it gives us 500W power from 0 mph). Then does the resistance start to grow slowly, and the voltage increases accordingly up to max RPM?

However it means the higher motor windings resistance, the more torque. This sounds logical, considering that motors with lower KV have more windings and resistance, and give more torque, but what if its high resistance is not related to the KV but to low motor quality?

I feel like I've written complete nonsense :sweat_smile:

```
The resistance of the motor doesn't increase, but the back-EMF (generated voltage) opposes the battery voltage more and more as speed increases, which makes the motor behave as if its resistance is changing.

The resistance is not directly related to torque or KV, merely a side effect. As I mentioned above, the strength of the magnetic field is proportional to the current times the number of turns. A lower KV motor (more torque) has more turns, and thus produces stronger magnetic fields per amp. But because wire has resistance, more turns means longer wire, which has a higher resistance.

When configuring FOC settings for my vescs, is it important that the motors have their belts on? When the FOC runs it's test functions to detect resistance, inductance, etc... is it important to have the drag of the wheel and wheel pulley felt by the vesc tool?

To be honest I'm just trying to find out what they mite be... Long story short... i bought this board a month ago now.. and I'm on my second one... the first one i got a 20km distance ride out of then i came home n charged it and the charger started flashing green and red after an hour.. where the charge time is meant to be 3 hours... then when i went for the next ride I got 8km distance and the board died... I got sent a replacement and it done the same thing... so the supplier offered half the cost n keep the second board as a refund... now I'm here tryn work out the best hack for me to go ford... I found a local ebike supplier with a trickle charger  so I'm gonna get them to try bring back the battery but yea not holding my breath

@Sn4pz @cubed You could use USB-PD standard, which is up to 20v and 5A, for 100w. You would need an onboard module to convert from 20v/5A to battery voltage, and negotiate with your charger. 

I would not recommend just using any old connector (USB-C) and run any old voltage and current through it. That's how people end up with exploded electronics, or melted connectors. (USB is current limited to 500ma unless your device negotiates with the charger for more power. Your esk8 charger is not similarly limited.)

Site has some errors in spacing, grammar, and punctuation so maybe rushed a bit but specs wise looks fairly legit.  Biggest problem usually with the budget boards is crappy ESCs and/or crappy motors and/or crappy batteries.  I'd be tempted to replace the ESC with a unity or dual flipsky boards I think.  Also seeing as how the site looks a bit rushed guess is the boards may be the same maybe worth trying to contact the company though see if you can get more details how long they've been operating boards sold etc.

Hi all, since I don't want to start a new topic and pollute this forum is ask my question here, also because I'm a noob:upside_down_face: Question; Does someone know a simple 2.4ghz remote that is accepting a normal potentiometer? I just want to control a DC motor with a analog potmeter, that's the plan. But I don't want to build a remote from scratch. Since there are many small E-skateboard remotes with potmeter I thought this is the easiest way to get some stuf up and running. Here is a pic of how it should look like when ready ![Remote%20potentiometer|394x500](upload://fjgvziB3lRj6Pv8qgVlBV8TdEiR.jpeg)

Also, if a cheap remote can accept a potmeter what type do I need? I see 5K and 10K but are these okay? Hope someone can help me out with this or at least getting me somewhat in the right direction.

Most of the esk8 remotes use potentiometers, and most of the potentiometers are 10k. Of course, the best way to be sure your pot matches the remote is to actually look at the pot in the remote, and then buy one that matches.

Ok thank you for your reply! I ordered two types of remotes with a receiver. One came lastweek and this one did not have a potmeter but I think it is called a hall sensor? A magnet that travels away from a little thing that is soldered onto the pcb. I was totally confused, no possibility to solder a normal potmeter on to it. Now I hope the other model does have the potmeter and has some information written on it

It really depends on the weight (thickness) of the fiberglass you're using. For an enclosure with no mechanical/structural loads on it other than its own mass, I'd say 1/16" (~1.5mm) should be more than sufficient. You'll have to figure out how many layers of fiberglass are needed to make up that thickness though.

Polyester resin can be used with vacuum impregnation, but it's not ideal for several reasons: It's really, really smelly and attacks many materials, such as rubber gloves. It's also hard to mix perfectly because the ratio of resin to hardener is so high (drops of hardener to ounces of resin), it's setup and curing time is very dependent on the temperature and the amount of hardener you used, and it is pretty viscous which makes vacuum impregnation even more problematic.

Having gone through this whole process myself, my recommendation is that you save yourself a lot of hassle and just buy some good low-viscosity epoxy resin online.

Ok, I'll take that into consideration. Haven't looked into it that much but I might run into problems having the resin shipped to Iceland. I already have polyester resin so I might do some tests with it make a small scale prototype.

If you go forward with polyester, I'd recommend working somewhere cool or cold during the initial steps to make sure you get done with your layup before the resin starts to kick off, and also don't try to do vacuum infusion - Do a wet layup and then vacuum bag, because the resin is too thick to flow for infusion. Once you've got everything wet out and bagged, you can warm things up to speed up the hardening. 

Be aware that the volume of mixed resin has a great effect on pot life - a small scale batch will cure much slower than a large one. My last attempt at fiberglass with polyester was a partial failure because I mixed one big batch and it started to set up before I was ready.

That'll protect you from most things except a direct screen-down on asphalt or concrete. If you want more durability I'd suggest getting an action camera - A GoPro session or a chinese gopro knockoff. Cheaper than a phone and much much more durable.

Hey guys. I bought a riptide R1 a year or so ago, and I wish I had gone for a board with a bigger deck, because I just am not that comfortable on the riptide deck. That being said, I would like to deck swap since it would be relatively easy to move the parts over. While I am at it, I think I will replace the stock trucks with Calibers since there are reports of the hangars snapping. I want to swap to a Landyachtz evo, or another drop deck, but I am concerned about clearance. Are these viable options, or should I look at other options? I figure I will definitely need risers, but I wonder about motor clearance as well. Any help or suggestions are welcome! I hope to start to get into DIY type stuff, and this seems like a simple start!

If you mean the thin (<0.5mm) glass screen protectors, then A: they're not tempered, and B: they're okay for a casual drop and scratches (I always have one installed), but I guarantee if you drop your phone at speed facedown or fall and land on it, you will have a broken screen.

As for hammer tested, hammers are generally smooth and that distributes the impact. A rock will break it much more easily (Guess how I know?).

And bulletproof? Don't make me laugh. The only thing it'd stop is an airsoft bb.

You've covered your bases as well as can be expected with a phone, but it's still just a vulnerable slab of glass, metal and plastic without any of the ruggedizing that goes into an action camera, even a cheap one.

Hey!

I have been waiting hours to be able to make a thread, but this might do. I have been looking and thinking about electric skateboards for a long time now. I had so many questions when i started, even more now.. The thing is most builds out there is longboards. I also have some specific requirements:

    - Needs to be a cruiser/shortboard with a kicker
    -  Motor can do steep hills without sweating. I need torque right?
    - Durable
    - Battery lasts as long as possible
    - Speed is not very important, battery and steep hills is.
    - I want the best money can buy. When it will be quite expensive anyway, then i go all in. But it needs to be perfect. heh :slight_smile: 

I travel alot and therefore bring my cruiser EVERYWHERE. Thats the main reason it needs to be small, have gooood battery and torque. Its heavy to push an electric skateboard around with no battery, right? I have been using this exact model for many years now: 

 https://eu.globebrand.com/products/blazer-rosewood-black?variant=1007908093955



But i have been thinking about getting one of those carbon fiber boards so that it does not get too heavy. Not tried them. I love wood and ive heard your feets gets tired because its so stiff. Aiaiai, so hard. Mostly need help with motor and battery. What is the alternatives with these requirements? :slight_smile:

For maximum range in a small package, cylindrical cells (18650, 2170, 26650) are the way to go - much more energy per unit volume than lipo pouches. 

You want torque, and the best way to get torque is to gear low. Most boards with regular wheels (not pneumatic) have something like a 2.4:1 reduction, so going up to like 2.8 will improve hill-climbing. 
Runing an extra-low-KV motor will also help (the usual is 190, but you can find 170 and 140 sometimes), as will having a beefy motor and speed controller to handle lots of amps for low-end grunt.

@b264 has a bit of a fetish for boards with a kicktail, so I bet he can point you towards an appropriate deck, enclosure, battery, etc.

For a shorty board with a big battery, you may end up running out of space for the motor under the board, in which case reverse mounting it is an option, but it may be tricky with a kicktail.

While battery backpack is something that has been done before, it's usually either a last resort or an experiment due to the multiple drawbacks of such a setup, such as voltage spikes from long wires, danger of entanglement or inadvertent disconnection, increased risk of shorts or battery damage in a fall, and having an angry, flaming battery attached to you in the case of a fire.

Hi,

This is more of a scooter question but I need to rebuild the battery pack of my m365. a 5 inch nail wrecked one of the rails that goes along side the batteries. I ordered a new one but I can't find a complete teardown of the pack anywhere online.

Thoughts?

Guys, I need help,

I have 2 x 10,000 mAh, 6s LIPO packs and they're wired in parallel, giving me 20,000 mAh capacity at 6s. At the moment I balance charge them but am wanting to put them in an enclosure so ordered a couple BMS's. At first, I thought that I could use a 6S BMS but then wondered how it would balance each individual cells as there are 12? Would I combine each balance wire together such as each cell 1 wire together, cell 2 together etc etc and then solder onto the pads on the BMS as there are only 6 spots. 

OR, I also bought a 12s BMS for £35 ( stupid) and was wondering if I could put each balance wire to an individual balance section. Would that work or would it OVER charge the pack, expecting 44.4V?

Also, how do I bypass for discharging? Not connect one wire? 

Sorry for such a loaded question, I'm so confused and want to ensure they all balance charge

Thank you for the help. Not sure if im quoting both of you. Anyway.
The build looks great, but it is too big.  I like the idea of using LiFePo4 but im really struggling to find anything that would fit without 110 mmh wheels and a lot of risers. But, the packs are made out of many cells like the 18650? So if I bought f.eks 10 of those, then I could arrange them so that they would neatly fit under my board and by that save a lot of space ? I’m also thinking it might be wise to go for hub motors to save space..? Torque is not great on those  I know. But I do want smaller wheels, and thought that might make up for it. 

I also red that hubs can be pushed around like a regular skateboard, which is great . Very great. So hard this is, heh.

[/quote]

This is a myth spread by marketing departments at companies that sell shitty skateboards.  Hub motors and belt drive both have resistance.  Gear drive has less than belt.

The good thing about belt is that if you have to, you can cut the belt off with a pocket knife and have ZERO resistance because it IS a regular skateboard.  (not the case for any other drive)  Then it's a four dollar, four minute fix once you get home.

Don't use hubs unless you use [Hummie Hubs](https://forum./t/hummie-hubs-kickstarter/2540).  No other hubs.

If you're looking for lots of range in a small package, LiFePO4 is not the chemistry for you. It is safer and very power-dense, but very lacking in energy density compared to 18650s. (LiFePO4 18650: 30A, 3.63wh. Regular 18650: 20A, 10.8wh.)

You will need more than ten 18650 cells. Probably the minimum viable is 20 (10s2p), and more is better, both for more range and better power for climbing hills.

I hate to say it but it sounds like you're chasing a unicorn - Tiny build with lots of range and hill climbing ability is very difficult. 

Even the build B264 linked which you said is too big only has "About 12 miles (19.3km) at low speed on flat, dry terrain on a warm day is best-case range I think. Real life range probably closer to 8.5 miles (13.7km) or 5 miles (8km) if you’re mashing the throttle."

Hi there!

I just wanted to ask how are you going with cooling the (V)ESC in the enclosure while maintaining somewhat of a water resistency. I consider vents a big NoNo regarding risk of water ingress.

I would use two Vesc 4.12 with Hub Motors (90mm).

I thought of thermalglueing heatsinks over the FETs and putting a small Noctua fan inside the case blowing onto the heatsinks. But then it is blowing the warm air inside the case onto the heatsinks and not fresh cool air from the outside.
```

---
## \#7584 Posted by: MysticalDork Posted at: 2019-07-09T00:28:26.048Z Reads: 56

```
The 4.12 is really badly designed for easy cooling. Your idea would help some, but for anything better I'd recommend one of the 6.x based vescs with directfets and an aluminum heat spreader/heatsink built in. You can pass that through the enclosure or sandwich heatsinks on the outside of the enclosure to conduct heat that way.

Be careful with your heatsinks if you go that route, it's really easy to accidentally short something out.
```

Gear drive is heavier, more expensive. Belt drive is lighter, cheaper, simpler. (I am speaking in generalities here.)

Gear drives usually has lower rolling resistance depending on the oil/grease and other factors.

Depending on the exact design, gear drive can be very quiet or quite loud. Belts are usually medium-quiet.

Gear drive usually needs to be enclosed to keep the rocks and dirt out, and keep lubrication in. Belt drive usually tolerates debris very well.

If a belt fails, you can replace it and be on your way. If one of your gears breaks/strips, you need a whole new gear or maybe both.

There are several gear drive options, but for the most part belt drives are better for low ratios (2:1, 3:1) where gear drives really have the advantage with higher ratios (4:1, 5:1).

Given the increased size, weight, cost, and higher ratios, gear drives are most commonly designed for mountainboards, rather than regular street boards. Some examples are [Kaly.NYC](https://www.kaly.nyc/product-page/helical-gear-drive-1-4) and [3DServisas](https://shop.3dservisas.eu/collections/drivetrain/products/fatboy-ss-drive-hd?variant=20235926765661).

Yes, you can go over dirt and grass, but you'll probably get stuck because urethane wheels are slick and have no knobs like tires do. Best way to test the capability of your vehicle is to actually ride it.

I have a single motor lift board, and they made it un changable. I bought a 270-5m kit to replace the ground down plastic parts but it's too long and won't fit on my mount. So I tried a mount from the 225-3m kit I bought but it isn't long enough. If I were to change from 3m to 5m I'd need new wheels and a bigger mount but I don't have the time or money to be guessing and I want to do this as cheaply as possible bc I only bought this to get to work. The only 270 kit I found with a mount is $96 and I'd rather just buy a motor kit for a bike

Hey All! 

I have a board from diyeboard.com ([This One](http://3753dc0cea44cedd617947dfe5cba509))

that overall is alright. But I do have a MAJOR issue with it. If I go full speed for more than 45 seconds, the power will shut off completely on the board. It will NOT turn back on until I plug it back onto the charger- and the. It’ll pop back on and perform as normal. 

What do I need to swap out to fix this issue? I tried to research and am not sure if the ESC is overheating or the battery is no good

Short easy answer - you can't. Most cheap hubs don't have replaceable urethane, and the ones that do often don't have a steady supply of replacements.

One of many reasons to steer clear of hub motors on anything but a toy board.

You can replace the other three wheels, but it'll always feel like garbage because three wheels have like 25mm+ of urethane, and one has like 8mm.

@bruh 
Short easy answer, you can't. Most cheap hub boards are not easily upgradeable, and certainly not for "cheap". 

esk8 is expensive. Either you accept this now, or you spend days/weeks/months banging your head against the wall, spending money on small upgrades to a crappy board before realizing you could have just built or bought a decent one from the beginning and spent less money.

Also see my above answer to your earlier question.

You kind of fucked yourself by buying the cheapest single-hub thing. Either you recognize that now and do better, or you suffer. Your choice.

Aight, after some working in my spare time ive extended my budget to 500 bucks (100 goes to getting parts to build the actual skateboard locally). I have a 3D printer and some knowledge of CAD so I could design a pulley that would fit my trucks and I'm 90% sure it would be strong enough with 100% infill PETG, worst case scenario it breaks and considering I don't die I either get a stronger material to print with or a metal pulley if I gather more cash. Anyway, it all boils down to the electronics alone. I figured based on some other post that these parts would most likely do me good:

SK3 245kv motor
2 3S 5-8ah batteries in series
Hobbywing 6s esc (not sure if it includes a remote, basing it off banggood)

Im wondering if this would be worth building, is my budget still too strict? I would probably be using it about 10km (about 7 miles) a day (preferably have it go closer to 16km) hoping to reach (20 mph) 40km/h. Is something like wowgo 3 the way to go on this budget? Any advice would be appreciated! *Sorry for replying to you specifically btw, just really trust your brutally clear response to questions like these*

i use metal pla in prints that are high stress its heavier and more durable. 245 kv might give you trouble if your heavy or plan to climb hills. this is a better motor by far https:///collections/electric-skateboard-motors/products/electric-skateboard-motor-6355-190kv https:///collections/esc-speed-controller/products/torque-esc-bldc-electronic-speed-controllerhttps:///collections/remote-controller/products/torqueboards-2-4ghz-mini-remote-controller
500 is strict but it can definatly be done however you must rember buy nice or buy twice applies

Can someone please explain batteries to me? There are a lot of numbers and I don't quite understand how they connect:

There's the "s" number, the "p" number, the "c" rating, the voltage, and the mAh number. 

I know s means number of cells, that c is the discharge rate, and I know what voltage and mAh are, but I don't quite understand how to pick the right ones. What will give me longer battery life? what will give me more power? How do I know what is correct?

A gigantic thank you to anybody who can help!

That's a great material for for thickening resins, but for battle hardening you really don't need much thickening. Just fill any gaps between and behind the magnets, and then coat your windings. For the gap filling between the magnets you might want some thickening, but behind them, and for coating the windings, a thinner resin is actually helpful.

You also need to waterproof the sensor PCB, and usually that's best done with a conformal coating, rather than an epoxy resin.

I'd say be prepared for a slide, you're better off with gear on that lets the force be distributed over time instead of taking impact in one shot.  When rolling chances of twisting something under your rolling body in a weird way or otherwise slapping something on the ground is higher, that said I don't know if you really get a choice about it, but if you are in control enough when bailing then sliding is generally a safer thing to do.  Rolling out works for people doing parkour and at running speed because they are preparing for it and focused on rolling in a way that keeps them safe.

Hi people,

1. I am making my 18650 battery pack, but does anyone recommend to put fish paper / kapton tape between the cells in series like shown below? So that if the plastic around the battery melts, It doesn't short everything.

![image|324x141](upload://omrkvTmurRcDnENXkoOYgvrHMS3.png) 

2. And which AWG should I use for the bms wires?

3. I am planning on making 4 parallel packs of 10 batteries in series. Is this the desired way, or should I make 10 parallel packs of 4 batteries in series? Or doesn't this matter?

4. I heard kapton tape reflects heat alot or is this not true? Should I use it to isolate my connections or should I use heat-shrink for this? 

5. I just bought batteries with soldering lips from NKON, because I didn't want to spend money on a spotwelder. I first thought I could just solder the lips together without overheating the batteries, but it turns out I have got just a little space left to solder. 

Has anyone got tips to solder those soldering lips together without overheating the battery?

Greetings from Holland

Yes, it is recommended to use fish paper between cells. Kapton is very heat resistant but not abrasion resistant, and the biggest danger of shorting between cell groups is vibration causing the plastic wrap to break through that way.

The discharge wires should be sized for whatever your maximum discharge current will be - 12AWG or 10AWG is good. Your balance wires should be about 22AWG. (anything between 18-24AWG really.)

You should have ten blocks, each with four cells in parallel. If you go the other way, you'll just be making it harder to wire together properly.

You should use heat shrink and fish paper primarily. Kapton is too thin and prone to abrasion to use as the sole insulating layer. I tend to put kapton under places where I have to solder near the cells so any stray solder won't burn through and wreak havoc.

Don't try to solder directly to your cells. Use a bus bar or connection PCB, and solder your tabs to that.

try loosening the mount clamp slightly, applying some pressure on the motor end one way or the other, and tightening the clamp while maintaining the pressure. Spin it and see which way the belt goes - has it changed direction, or how fast it wanders? The best way to get this perfect is just trial and error.

Hoping people still check this page... I want to build a board with around a 12-16 mile range and ideally around a 25mph top speed. I live in Langley BC (about an hour away from Vancouver, canada) and there's quite a few hills nearby, so something with enough torque to get me up them would be ideal.
I have a landyachtz drop carve 40, and a loaded tan Tien which I think is about a 38". Both boards come with bear 5.01 trucks. Would any of these work to start off with or should I start looking for a different deck/trucks. Im honestly quite overwhelmed but I've been boarding for the past 8 or so years and I have no clue where to start. Any pointers? 
If you've gotten through this without having a seizure then I guess that's a good start.

Ps. Is mboard a good place to start for electronics? Or are they not recommended.

There's also a calculator linked (header banner) from forum dot esk8 dot news.  Generally speaking under 60k eRPM is limit, for typical 7 pole pair or 14 pole motor we use the max kv can be computed as 60,000/7 = 8500, 8500 / battery voltage = max kv motor to use.  Say you have 50V battery 8500/50 = 170 (rounding)

Also most components on VESCs are rated max 60V but more headroom you leave less likely a big spike causes an issue.

I have an issue that I posted in another thread but haven't heard anything back yet. 
Getting kinda worried 
So I figured I'd ask here as well? 
(hope that's OK) 
Is it OK to unplug the xt90 connectors powering a vesc while the vesc is on. 
Think my bms or battery was bad and my power switch thats build in isn't working and it's not powering off.
My vescs are on and I have no way of powering down unless it's safe to pull the xt90 plugs apart. 

Thank you for any help

Unplugging is fine - It's plugging them in that can create a big spark if you don't have an antispark loopkey or similar.

This forum is becoming less and less active as people migrate over to https://forum./, so you might want to go over there for future help.

Don't know if this is a noob question or not but I'm a bit curious about battery degredation. I've got a hub-board with a 10s2p 30Q that I've ridden for about 3 months, approx one charge per day overall and I've noticed that the battery's reach is like 50-60% of what it used to be. Is this normal considering the amount of riding and how much is the summer to blame? (about 25 degrees celcius over here)

That sounds excessive. IIRC, the 30Q cells are supposed to have a cycle life of 250 cycles to 70% capacity when being run at 20A with only breaks for the temperature to come down.

I thought so as well. Could it be the ESC starting to fail? I noticed also now when I charge the board fully (green light on charger) the battery indicator for the board still has the one last bar that doesn't light up. Any similar experiences?

It's possible your ESC or BMS is causing the problem. I haven't had any similar issues, but it sounds plausible.

I have LED strips installed under my board since I ride at night often from work. I have the battery pack and Bluetooth module installed in a small pelican case on the top of the board. I did this because I have not found an easy to understand tutorial to wire the strips directly to the board.

I am now trying to find and install a simple waterproof button or switch to the USB cable that connects to the battery pack so I don’t have to open my pelican case each time to turn on and off the lights. Can someone help with directing me to switches (on amazon would be great but not required) that would work as an inline switch for the USB cable. I have already shortened the USB cable so I can confirm that it only has two wires which should make it easier to wire.

The LED strip is 5v and I do not have the in-depth knowledge to know if I could wire a switch that is for 12v to this or not. Any insight for guidance would be of great help.

@Sig0431  The only things to worry about are A: make sure the switch can handle the current you're running through it. B: make sure the voltage rating is equal or higher than what you plan to run. (These can both be fudged to some extent, with a corresponding loss of longevity.) C: if your switch is lighted, make sure you feed the light the correct voltage - some are 12v, and some are 120v. It won't hurt to run less, but your lighting will be either dim or nonexistant. Do not run higher.

Hi all,

I'm sure this issue has been posted a million times. I've visited 10 different threads on the topic but couldn't find any working solution.

I've got a dual sensored 6355 4.12 Vesc, everything from TB.
I ran firmware updates on both, motor detection worked on one but when I try to do it on the other I've got "bad detection results" error... The motor does spin. 
The vescs are connected via can bus. I tried setting up the faulty one while disconnecting the can bus as someone on another topic advised, didn't work.

I'm kinda lost.

Here are my settings.

Hi everyone, I got my first VESC FSESC6.6 and APS 6384.
The VESC spec says: 6V - 60V (safe for 3S to 12S LiPo)

I didn't build battery pack yet.

Is it really not safe to connect 1 cell li-ion battery to the VESC just to check if it works (no riding) and play with the settings in the VESC tool? Or it's just won't work with 1-2 cells?

Hey guys, I'm a noob and literally know nothing so I felt this was the appropriate place to ask a question. I used to build longboard skateboards and sell them in shops in the socal area. So I have experience in wood presses and deck crafting...

With that said, I want to make a board that has good power, range, and can go off road, as well as, have the ability to cruise around town. 

I was looking at the backfire X2 as the type of board I'd be interested in. 

Would it just be cheaper to just buy that board and take the components off of it? Or could I get a different kit that might perform better? 

Thanks a ton! 

- Abel

@Drom The vesc just won't power up at all with a 1s battery. Maybe with a 2s, but definitely with a 3s.

@infiniteoffset Generally it's considered best practice for all the stuff in your enclosure to be mounted to the board, not the enclosure, that way the enclosure doesn't have to support the additional weight. Straps, screws, velcro, double-sided tape, all are acceptable for various degrees of permanence.  

@burke Define "good power." Define "good range." 
For the same result, DIY is almost always not cheaper than just buying a finished board - you will break stuff, you will need extra tools, extra materials, etc. If the backfire x2 looks like what you want and you just want to have a board, I'd suggest just buying it and be done. 
If you go DIY, you must be prepared to spend a lot of time reading, researching, building, rebuilding, and generally faffing about until you have something that works - a month late and 50% overbudget. If this sounds like a fun time to you, then I'd suggest taking a dive through [this thread.](https://forum./t/is-diy-right-for-you/112/2) It goes into great detail.

According to [the flipsky website](https://flipsky.net/products/flipsky-remote-vx1), the flipsky VX1 can communicate via PPM or via serial. Are you sure you've got it hooked up correctly for PPM on both ends?

and if it still doesn't work, have you tried hooking it up for serial instead?

You'll want to count your your p groups as 1 cell. - 10 cells in series so set that to 10

the p groups dont add any voltage so that meter sees each p group as one (large capacity) cell. (well it doesnt see each cell, it just sees the total voltage.)

@ODBounty  What is your battery voltage? Give me a number. It can be from vesc tool, or a multimeter, or the metr app...


There should be instructions that came with your battery meter on how to set it up - have you read and understood them? 
There is a way to switch chemistries - li-ion, lipo, lifepo4, lead acid, etc. and you have to have it set to the right one: li-ion. If you get it wrong, it won't read accurately.

If you've got it set to L 10 and it's still not working, I dunno what to tell you. I'd play around with different settings and see if I could get a decent reading out of it somehow.

It's possible that it's calibrated for lipo rather than cylindrical li-ion cells - lipos usually only like to be discharged down to ~3.6-3.7v, and cylindrical cells can go down to 3.0 or lower, so that may be the reason for your issue - it sees 36v (divided by ten series cells = 3.6/cell) and calls that 0% instead of 40%.

This is why on my board, I just used a straight voltage meter and did the math in my head to estimate % from that - you can change the math in your head if it ends up being wrong.

Anyways, I am deciding on building a new esk8, and I am deciding on if I should go for these
https:///collections/electric-skateboard-motor-mounts/products/v5-fixed-motor-mount-set

First of all, I tried the TorqueBoard motor mounts before and they seem fine for low power usage, but I still want someone to confirm since I am not so sure of their mechanical design. Or if there are better alternatives that won't break my bank.

Second, I am deciding of I should grab these trucks just so I can load two 6374's (or 6384's?!?), or if I should stick to my Caliber I trucks for better truck quality and just load two 6355's.
https:///products/torqueboards-218mm-trucks

I thought they were about to release VESC 6's lasting time I was active. Anyways, are VESC's from Torqueboard still good for high power performance or FOC? 

I am budgeting around 600$ without battery and remote.  Thanks ya'll. 😘

Hi everyone,
Excited to say I've finally joined the community been lurking around for a while.  I just got my hands on a used WowGo 2S and starting to consider the first upgrades I'd like to make.  The first question I got is what is the affect of having larger sized wheels on the front than the back?

My board comes with the stock 90x53mm, I'm planning on only replacing the front, and will do the hub motors at a later time.  Looking online I'm not finding much in the 90mm size, more in 97mm.  Will this cause instability or ride issues? If it makes a difference I'm planning on installing Paris V2 Trucks and replacing the deck with something like the loaded decks.

Thank you,
```

I have another noob question.
Increasing the the motor pulley in size gives you more top speed and a lower size motor pulley would decrease speed but more torque? 
Making sure I have it right? 

If I increased just the wheel pulley would this work in the same way. 

If I go from 36t to 38 or 40T would that increase my top speed even more and would I loose torque?

You can't use just any remote with any receiver. If you have a flysky remote, you need a flysky receiver. If you have a benchwheel remote, you need a benchwheel receiver.

I can't find any information about that remote (I didn't look that hard though.) so I don't know what protocol it uses, what encoding, or even if it came with a receiver at all. I don't know if it even came with instructions on how to bind it.

You need more information.

Is the way to calculate speed the same for an htd3m pulley vs a hdt5m pulley? The overall diameter of the pulley is smaller as well 🤷

@Sn4pz  As long as the ratio of teeth is the same, the actual number doesn't matter at all. 16:36 is the same as 27/60.

Since 3m belts have smaller teeth, they have to be tighter to prevent skipping, and need to have more teeth engaged than with 5m belts to transfer the same power. Keep this in mind when picking pulleys.

Well there is the weight to consider too so they are not exactly the same. It will tax the motor more with the bigger gears so I’d say less torque.

Weight has zero effect on torque or motor load when running at a constant speed. It does have an effect under rapid acceleration (inertia and all that) but I would bet that you couldn't measure the difference with the sizes we're talking about.

Hi Everyone, Noob here.

I have been lurking around reading through threads and am blown away at how much knowledge is packed into this forum. 
Anyway am starting to scheme up some plans for my first DIY build. I'm hoping to jump into the deep end building a 12S8P battery using 30Q samsung cells. I do realize pre-built packs are out there but I would like to print my own modular enclosure to hold 8P groups of cells (and yes I realize other members have done similar things).

My question is on the topic of current ratings for the series connections in this battery. With an 8P setup I expect the cells to support up to 120A continuous current with bursts of 160A. I would like to design the internal series connections of the battery to handle the same, but I don't know what kind of connection I will need.  My plan is to spot weld each parallel group together with nickle plate and then tuck the group into its own modular tray. I think I will need to route some kind of wired connector between the groups.
Here's what i'm not sure of:
What wire will work here (what gauge) without getting too hot? 
Should I use thicker wire or run multiple together? 
Are there other series connector options I should look into?

Any advice is appreciated, thanks!

Could a vanguard 42” flex 2 be made a bit more flexy by slimming the middle section with a table saw or at a wood shop?

Would that affect the structural integrity? 

Also, could the bms be in one enclosure and the battery pack spread out in two enclosures? I’m thinking about using two eboosted 12s4p enclosures and use only one 12s8p bms for both of them. 
Would it be possible to wire them in such way?

@AlvinB  Here's my breakdown of motors for single and dual, ordered by least to most fun/power.
 * Single 5055 or 5065: Boo!
 * Single 6355: Meh
 * Single 6374: Great!
 * Dual 5055: Okay
 * Dual 5065: Better
 * Dual 6355: Awesome!
 * Dual 6374: Overkill!

It all depends on your needs/requirements. Smaller motors are lighter and cheaper. Bigger motors handle more power for longer without overheating. More aggressive riding styles generally benefit the most from bigger motors, e.g. mountainboards with pneumatic wheels.
Keep in mind that big motors (63xx) need bigger vescs and a significant battery to really unlock their full potential - a regular 4.xx vesc with nothing but heat shrink tubing on it just will not cut the mustard.

As for those brands, be careful of import taxes on them but in my own testing, my recent pair of SK8s actually had problems compared to ones bought back when they first came out. 

Look around here for other opinions but the quality may have declined recently. Alienpowersystems sells okay-ish motors, and you could pick up Maytechs from bioboards or streetwing and they've worked well even at high amps for me.

M365 BMS serial number error...

I purchased a clone M365 scooter that was advertised as an original on eBay, I ended up getting my money back and ebay let me keep the scooter. I’ve been swapping parts to try to upgrade it to as close to an original as possible.  I purchased an original controller, aftermarket battery with LG cells and a clone pro dashboard.  Everything worked fine except when I would turn on the headlight the display would turn off. I saw a YouTube video that said to downgrade the firmware. The dashboard firmware downgraded fine, the controller BLE firmware wouldn't downgrade and the battery BMS firmware downgraded and apparently changed the batteries serial number... The sticker on the outside of the battery has a different serial number then in the mi home app and I'm getting error code 22.   If anybody has any advice on how to fix this I would appreciate the help.

@AlvinB  The Torqueboards kit is pretty decent. You can definitely shop around and find good deals, but of course if you do that you're more at risk of not getting everything to fit perfectly. It really depends on how much you value your time and how confident you are in your ability/stubbornness to reach an acceptable result.

Just like motors, battery selection is a judgement call. I would caution you about going with 12S if you don't need it, just because it's more stress on the system - 10S is usually fine for most builds. I will reiterate though: **if you have big motors, you need a bigger battery to feed them.** 12s2p will only give you a maximum of 20 battery amps per motor - that's great for a dinky dual 5065 build, but comically small for a dual 6374.

You seem not to have internalized the One Great Truth of DIY esk8: **ESK8 is expensive. Large powerful dual-6374 esk8, is VERY expensive.** Be prepared to spend upwards of $1000 on a full build. **There is *NO GUARANTEE* that building a DIY will be cheaper than buying a premade.** If you don't love building stuff for the sake of building stuff, this may not be for you.

If you read more carefully, it clearly says:
* **LIPO/LiFe - 1-6S**
* **NiMH/NiCd - 1-15S**

Your 12s battery is **NOT** a NiMh/NiCd, it is li-ion. That charger will only charge li-ion type batteries of **1-6S**. Therefore you cannot charge your 12s battery with this 6s charger.

Read more, kids. It really does help.

I mean yes I read that, but I know for a fact you can charge lipos with the other setting, not it is definitely not recommended or safe by any means but can be done to bring cells back to life, that’s why I asked, since there is a battery management in place with these cells I wasn’t sure if it would accept the power and dispense it accordingly. And referencing back to the pic, the NiMH setting goes up to 15s which is higher than the 12s. But I’m guessing I’ll just need to buy another charger anyways, 4 or 5 isn’t to bad is it 🤣🤣

Nope, won’t work. The maximum voltage output of a 6s charger is ~25 volts (6x4.2). To charge your 12s pack, you need double that: 12x4.2, or 50.4 volts.

NiMh/NiCd batteries have a much lower cell voltage - 1.5 vs 3.7 for Li-ion cells. That means for the same given maximum voltage the charger can put out, you can have more in series - 15 in this case. (Hey look, since math is commutative, 15 times 1.5 is 22.5 volts! Almost identical to the voltage required to charge a 6s lipo!)

To charge a 12s li-ion pack, you need either a 12s-capable balance charger (you can get them, but they're stupid expensive) or a 12s brick charger.

@KadenKross  Because the absolute **do-not-exceed** voltage of the vescs we use is 60v, and the voltage of a fully-charged 13s battery is 54.6v, which leaves very little room for error or voltage spikes. It's a reliability thing. 

It's the reason many people stick to 10s: 12s is still pretty close to the limit. 

Unless you have some special high-voltage ESC, I strongly recommend against going with 12s or 13s until you have a much stronger grasp of the hobby and more experience with electric vehicles in general. 

This is serious shit. Best case scenario you blow out your vesc and have to limp home and spend money on a new one. Worst case, your vesc shits itself, you streetface and break bones, and your board catches on fire. Do not take this lightly.

Hi all!  New to here and building boards in general.  I've ridden Esk8's now for a while and decided I just couldn't go further without trying my first build.  I went with a Torqueboards Direct Drive 90kv setup and everything seemed to go well.  It rides great and is a ton of fun (and freakish speed!!!).  I have a concern though, and would like to see if anyone else has seen, heard of or experienced this before.  As I turn the one motor/wheel it sounds like there is a little click/clunk noise in a certain spot.  The motor spins up fine and works as it should mostly, but I just shelled out this money and time for a nice home built board and I want to make sure it won't lock up or make me deadish.  Thanks all and hope to hear from someone soon!!!

I did smell burning - if you open it up big you can see the discoloration in the lower left hand corner. I assume that plus the burning smell equals fried chip. My main question is can we assume this is an oversight on @EnertionSupport for using a weak anti spark? If so has anyone had this replaced by them?

My limits were super low to my knowledge, I have a unity in my big 12s Lacriox build and pushed double what my settings were on this Unity. So confused as to why this would have occurred here and not there.

I don't have a schematic of the Unity in front of me so I won't be much help with diagnosis unfortunately. There are quite a few people that do vesc repairs (usually DRV chips) though, so it might be worth reaching out to some of them.

I posted this in the FOCBOX UNITY | Support, Setup & Troubleshooting but [PixelatedPolyeurthan](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/u/pixelatedpolyeurthan) suggested I try here since that forum is pretty quiet:  

I have been doing a lot of testing with the focbox Unity and it’s been very impressive. But for my next step I need to display and record some key data streams from the unity. Specifically: (Battery voltage, Motor voltage, Motor Amperage, RPM, Throttle, FET temperature, Motor temperature). I am currently reading and recording this data with an arduino but would really like to get a bluetooth option. I have tried the enertion Andoid app via bluetooth but the UI HUD gives very little data and doesn’t record. I have done a fair bit of searching and there are options but they appear to only work with aftermarket Bluetooth modules and I would really like and option that works with the Unity bluetooth module. And finally I would like to record and display the information from 6 different Unities at the same time (yes, I am running 12 motors!). Suggestions?

Thanks in advance, Kerry

Yes!  it has Matrix 2 trucks, there are plenty of motor mount systems available.  Talk to @Rithblu for belt drive, @moon for gear drive.  There are lots of others as well.    It has MBS FiveStar or rock star hubs, there is lots of pulleys available for them as well.  Talk tot he same people or search around, those are just the people that I have purchased from.

If your doing a top mount box, there are plenty of Plano types around.  A bottom mount enclosure may be a bit more difficult.

Should I get the torqueboard new direct drives when they are launching? Or should I go for dual 6374 belt drive?

I will probably get the torqueboards 12s4p battery and a foc box unity or flipsky 4.20 plus vesc. Will I go faster with the direct drives or the dual 6374?

And If I get the direct drives should I get the 75kv or the 90kv.

I'd use utility knife blades instead - the trapezoid ones - They're usually cheaper than exacto blades and unless you need the precision, they work just as well - and they're a little more robust.

I just reread your question - I've never used grip tape that frays like that, I assume it has some form of fiber reinforcement like fiberglass. If you have a torch maybe you can burn those filaments off? Or maybe use a sanding sponge to blend the tape edge with the board adge.

Hi, I am building a electric skateboard for the first time. I have experience with high speeds on longboards. Here is probably the parts that I will use.

• Deck: landyachtz 9 two 5
• Remote: flipsky vx1
• Vesc: flipsky 6.6
• Motor (2): TB 6374 190kv, not sure!
• Mechanical kit: TB dual motor kit with 110mm wheels and 218mm trucks.
• Battery: TB 12s4p
• Power switch: flipsky 

Everything about: 1300$

I have some questions:

1. Should I change any parts? Do I need anything else for the board to work like some sort of connectors?

2. Should I get the flipsky 6.6, flipsky 6.6 mini or 4.20 plus? What is the difference between them?

3. Should I switch the motors to TB's new direct drives? Will it have more torque? Speed? Are they worth getting over dual 6374?

4. If I get dual 6374 what motor should I get I know that the sk3 6374 190kv motor and TB 6374 190kv fit on the 218mm trucks. And the SK8 192kv barely fit the trucks. But the sk3 aren't sensored, is it important to have a sensored motor?

The picture in post 6077 on this thread shows that the SK8 barely fit. Is that a problem, couse the SK8- and TB motor is sensored. But the SK8 motor is cheaper. Can I get the SK8?

I am going to order all these parts soon, let me know if I need anything else or should change something.

• Deck: landyachtz 9 two 5

• Motor (2): TB 6374 or 6380 190kv
• Mechanical kit: TB dual motor kit with 110mm wheels and 218mm trucks.
• Battery: TB 12s4p
• Power switch: DON’T KNOW
• Bullet extension wire (2x): TB
• Sensor wires (2x): TB
• xt90 connectors: Hobbyking

Is it a big difference between the 6374 190kv TB and 6374 170kv TB. 
Should I go for a loopkey or a powerswich. And if so where should I buy them.

Thanks!

The difference between the 170 and 190 is that the 190 spins faster. The power should be very similar, but one has more speed, and one has more torque. Doesn't really matter as long as you get your gearing right. You **have** used a calculator to get your gearing figured out, *right?*

Go for a loopkey. They're cheap, simple and reliable.

[/quote]

Should really have asked me considering.  Sensors are good if you have never skated a board before and esk8 is all you know.  Personally I can't get on a board without a push first so sensors mean nothing to me.  Even a dead stop a hip flick will tell the motors what direction they are supposed to go in and away you go.  Thats all hall sensors do is relay the orientation of the motor to the vesc.  Thats it.  You want sensors and ease of set up then get the tb motors.  You want cheaper then sk8 but they are tricky to get to fit on tb218s.   I did it with some reverse wheel nut stuff but only just as you can see.  Sk3 are the most reliable motor on the esk8 planet but no sensors.  Belt drive will give you a much more more aggressive ride while directs are a bit smoother and less torquey.  Obviously this depends on gearing/settings/battery and host of other things that you will learn on this fantastic odyssey.  Massively generalising but you get the picture.  Hubs and directs are fixed at 1 to 1 gearing.   Belts and gear drives are changeable.  You don't like the way the directs work then tough tittie.  You want more grunt down low from a belt drive then change the ratio.  More flexible.

Oh and anyone that says 12s is risky is talking out of their arse.  Its fine.

Thank you for the timely reply. I am very sorry that I took so long to respond. Had some family issues. But all is well now. 
Anyway, I know what an esc is. However after doing about 10 minutes of Googling I'm unclear about what is different about a Vesc. The controller I have purchased to upgrade my e-scooter is a 48v 1000w single motor brushed controller. As I'm upgrading from a 24v system to a 48v. I'm also currently researching parts for my new build e-skate. I am using the scooter to  experiment with and learn on. As I don't mind if I ruin an old razor 300 that cost me $50.

Right now I'm trying to rebuild the battery and I am having difficulty finding a definitive answer / solution as to wether I should build 2x6s or 7s. Or. 1x13s.and if I should use bms's or a balance charger...  So many questions. So many videos on ytube that never really answer everything.. 
Right now I am trying to find a local aluminum Welding shop, or I will try to teach myself how to do it. I need to lengthen the battery compartment so I can fit these SPIM08HP cells in there. Or I might decide to try to build a backpack battery and just wear it. Also need to decide wether to clamp the tabs with copper or aluminum and thru bolts. Or if I should try to solider them. 

Thanks again for the info. I'll try to read more and catch up..  

KK..

Compared to a regular brushless ESC suc has those used for remote controlled airplanes and the like, the main difference is adjustability/customization. You can tweak just about every parameter in a vsc - battery current, motor current, acceleration curve, sensors, sensorless, BLDC or FOC (If you have one that supports FOC), maximum speed limit, switching frequency, traction control, the list goes on. 

With a "dumb" RC ESC, generally the most you can change is the voltage cutoff and maybe the braking behavior, and the brakes vary from nonexistent to terrible to screechy or locked-up-completely.

Compared to a brushed controller, the difference is even wider - I could build a brushed motor controller with those specs for maybe $25 because it's **really** dumb - basically it just interprets throttle and outputs PWM to the motor through a half-bridge. A $0.25 microcontroller, a $5 PCB and $15 in power switching components has you 90% there.

[/quote]

It really all depends on your specific application and parameters - What's your maximum budget? Maximum space? What kinds of motor can you find? How good are you at fabrication? Does this have to be a reliable workhorse, or do you not care if it breaks after 500m? 

I still *strongly* recommend not exceeding 10S or at most 11S on this first build. If you go much lower, then to get high power output you need very high currents, and if you go any higher, the risk of a catastrophic failure increases.

This is a known issue with non-OEM M365/M365pro dashboards. The boards are wired to deliver power to the LED headlamps on command, but the components on board can't actually deliver the juice. Instead, when you flip the lights on, the entire dashboard shuts off. The ideal solution is to use OEM dashboards, but the workaround is to accept the design flaw for what it is. I don't see how downgrading the firmware of the dashboard, speed controller, or battery management system would help. If you're not able to recover from the changes you've made, I'd suggest replacements that are entirely OEM or entirely open source, but nothing in between. Also, I suggest posting future questions on [https://forum.](https://forum./) since you never know when the helpful response you're relying on here gets deleted.

Thanks for the info I appreciate you taking the time, however I had originally purchased a aftermarket controller board and in trying to fix another problem I had swapped it out for a OEM controller.  In doing some research it was suggested that if a fuse was burned out on the controller board, that could explain the problems. And when I switched out the controller board for the non-OEM one(I don’t know if it being a OEM board made a difference or not, or something was defective on the board or one of the fuse is burned out) that fix the problem? The scooter also wouldn’t go above 18 km/h until I replace the OEM board with the aftermarket one. I was also able to update everything, dashboard, controller, BMS with the MI home app. but again thank you for taking the time I do appreciate it.

Can anyone comment on the torque and performance of 5055 motors especially at 200kv? Braking?
I have a 35” on ownboard hubs that’s my daily commuter, and the ride in Philadelphia streets is really poor despite all of the upgrades. 10s2p 30q
Currently running 90mm wheels and would likely give 100-110s a try. Trying to keep this light weight as possible, it’s a hefty 19 lbs. Can shave 0.5 lbs with 5055s over 6355s but is it going to disappoint me?
Equally concerned that dual 6355s is just massive overkill for a 35” commuter (I’m building a dual 6355 vanguard as well)

Any recommendations? Give the 5055 KV a go- the 6355 dual is overkill. Or the opposite?

Thanks

This was my very first attempt of soldering. ever. I think I botched it (Check image below). 
What went wrong: Solder leaked over to the other pin. I fear that this might cause a shortcut in the future. I watched a tutorial on how to solder this. He pretinned the wire and then pretinned the pin, then melting them both and pushing it down.  I had great trouble doing this. Moreover, the heatshrink did not fit onto the solder itself. My question is: **should I redo this completely? Buy new XT60 female connector and new heatshrink** Is my fear of shortcircuiting warranted?

@Hoaz 
Yes, definitely redo that, it's absolutely not safe.

Some pointers: 
It looks like you've got a very cold solder joint. Either your iron is not hot enough, or if it is hot enough it doesn't have enough thermal mass/thermal transfer ability to heat up your joint enough. Just judging by that plug, I'd guess you've got a ~20-25W "pencil" style iron with no adjustment - if so, you will basically never get a good joint on larger wires using that type of iron, they're only suitable for small stuff. 

Bare minimum in my opinion is a variable-wattage iron like **[this one](https://www.amazon.com/Soldering-Iron-Station-Solder-Kit/dp/B07S5PZTFZ)** with at least 40 to 60 watts, and a fairly beefy tip - not one of those fine pointy conical ones, you want either a chisel or a bevel. Expect to pay at least $30. 

Ideally I'd recommend a variable-temperature (actually measures and controls the temperature, not just the power) soldering station, such as a Weller or Hakko, or a [knockoff](https://www.amazon.com/YIHUA-Professional-Digital-Soldering-Station/dp/B07RVMZNYR), or a [TS100](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MD12DYT) - Expect to pay at least $50-80.

You also added way too much solder, probably in an attempt to overcome the lack of sufficient heat.

It also really helps to have the connector plugged into another (that's not wired to anything obviously), to keep the metal bits from shifting inside the plastic housing while everything is hot.

There is a window with  capital D in it.   On BLDC its beside the apply button.  On FOC its below the detect and calculate parameters title.   Up it in increments of 0.05 until you get a detection.

Soldering my balance cables for BMS discharge only.

Does anyone see a reason why I shouldn't do this? 

Cutting these in half so I only solder the wires together rather then having to solder the connector.

A good first try, here's some tips. Make sure you have a large solder tip since it makes transmitting the heat a little easier for large wire connections. If you melt the plastic, things are getting too hot and you should let it cool before attempting again. 
1) Apply flux to the inside of the XT60 connector pins first
2) Heat up the pin and add a good bit of solder until the pin is 1/4 to 1/2 full of solder
3) Tin the wire making sure the solder goes down into the wire
4) Hold the tinned wire in the pin (with the solder pool) and apply the soldering iron where the pin and wire meet. Continue heating around the connection until the two fuse. More solder may be required. Allow to cool completely before adding the heat shrink.

Just had a bit of a bummer as I was about to go for a ride.  Charger plugged into board, my LCD reads 100% charge.  Unplugged and it tanks down to 15%.  I haven't opened it up to look yet but figured I'd ask here to see if anyone may know the issue before I have the time to take things apart.  Could it be a problem with needing to replace my BMS or possibly just a loose wire somewhere? 12s6p running a unity if that helps at all.

Battery gauges that rely on reading voltage aren't accurate under changing load conditions. During charge the voltage across the battery will rise, causing the meter to read a higher state of charge. During discharge, the opposite will happen. 

This means that if your battery meter is calibrated and accurate under no-load conditions, you can't expect it to read correctly or accurately under either charge or discharge, only under no load.

I was riding and noticed the power is only like 60% what I’m used to, I looked back and saw my battery meter was at 100% after half mile when usually it’s already at like 75%, I noticed This connector came loose, I plugged it back in restarted board and it’s still showing 100% battery even after I rode it another 1.5 miles. I check and battery meter solders are still in tact. Any ideas on this? Also should add I have a 3dsevisas anti spark inline too.

that connector goes to the esc, its the standard motor plug. I have two esc’s and they are the torque board they are connected via can bus. The 10s2p battery is from metro boards and the cells and bms are “generic.” ![20191222_123534|281x500](upload://jsptjj3NxhHspoD7pLqkQUQzmJY.jpeg) ![20191222_123441|690x388](upload://fyhohJNGEUEn10dnAvm3b3ousYv.jpeg)

Hey guys pretty new to esk8ing. I built a board with the torqueboard 90 kv DD motors using the vesc6.6 and the 12s4p battery from mboards. (i know not the best place to get stuff) Anyhow after setting everything up I had the max motor current set to 75A which i figured is safe given the 80A limit for the motors. Everything seemed fine when i was going up a pretty decent sized hill and about 3/4 of the way up i lost all power and went flying. Not sure if this is due to low voltage cutoff of the battery or the BMS on the battery pack. Any suggestion would be great, thanks in advance.

hello, I've been fighting my raptor 2.1 for the past 2 hours and I think I've given up on the damn thing, Is there anyone that can help me via team viewer, sky, or a dang phone call.

A lil background:
My lcd was reading 86% for the past couple of days and i thought that it could be that I just needed to update the board (spoiler alert: i was wrong). so i went to enertions website and got the Focbox tool and used the included motor and app wizards to configure the board after i presumably updated the board, turns out i fixed the problem, but only by causing an even worse one. Throughout the setup I was asked to spin the wheels by hand, and i somehow missed the part that told me to spin them in the forward direction resulting in one wheel spinning forwards and the other spinning in reverse. I ran down stairs cause i didn't notice this by looking as they were spinning so quickly and i quite frankly didn't know it was a problem. any how i go back upstairs and try to fix it, but it no longer wants to connect or even recognize that the board is plugged in to begin with. The only thing that even tries to work is the bluetooth app, however that does nothing for me because when it attempts to calibrate nothing happens except for the occasional loud noise that gives me the slightest bit more hope to keep trying to solve the problem I'm having. please help @CarlCollins or anyone else with any idea of what i should do. I think the focbox is running 23.46 but i got no clue which of these numbers are my boards and which are what they should be etc.

thanks in advanced for any help

Heres some really noobish questions:
What happens if you don't have a power switch and keep the Vesc always plugged in to the battery?

my cheap ESC has died and I'm now on a quest upgrading it to VESC.
I bought two 4.20 VESCs from flipsky for my dual hub 10s2p mini board.
I also noticed that VESC also need a seperate remote, so over the dual 60$ I've spent, I now let go of another 50$ for the remote..

neglecting the connectors and wires to assemble everything, I now happen to realize that vesc also need a power button.. which happen to cost another briliant 50$(!)..

now here comes my question..

How come a cheap 50$ ESC can do dual motor control + have its own dedicated remote control with battery indicating + have a power button + have auto ON/OFF switch integration, while the super sophisticated (expensive) VESC doesn't?

why do I need a 50$ anti spark button to hardwarely disconnect the vesc from the batteries all the time?

I didn't do that on my ESC.. it simply wen't to sleep after few minutes..

Does the VESC never goes to sleep? whats the wattage drawback of the VESC while on idle? 
If its neglectable, can I simply leave it plugged in all the time?

You just run the risk of killing your battery. A low voltage alarm could help. Regardless, you'll probably end up opening it up to disconnect it if you want to let it sit for longer than a few days, which is why an external loop key is a great option. I bet you could get somebody to make you one and send you a printed holder for like $10.

The vesc does not got to sleep, it's always running. Its idle current draw depends on several factors, including but not limited to the battery voltage, the exact hardware version of the vesc, the exact firmware version it's running, the exact settings you've got in in, and the phase of the moon.

Don't chance it. I recommend making up a loop key and being done with it. It's cheap, simple, and robust.

Well, then maybe you see now why people think it's reasonable to charge $50 for a finished, not-"ugly", not-"inconvenient", not-exposed, not-dependent-on-your-soldering-skills antispark switch! What a concept! :upside_down_face:

I hate to break it to you, but if you got into the DIY esk8 world to save money, you've got another think coming. Either you accept that you cannot place a monetary value on your time and effort, or you spend extra money to have things done by other people so you don't have to. Things will break, and you will have to fix/replace them. Tools (like a decent soldering iron and related accessories) are required, and they cost money. Skills (like soldering) are required, and those take time to learn.
Unless you already have all the tools and skills necessary, DIY is rarely faster or cheaper than buying a premade thing.

It's almost as if it's a forum by builders, for builders, rather than a megaphone for a certain money-grubbing, underdelivering, insolvent Australian esk8 company or something. :thinking:

Thank you my dude !! I also got clarification from @longhairedboy and Pavel .. I knew my knowledge was not wrong.. Dealing with a battery supplier that doesn't have much knowledge with esk8 is tough 😄.. I'd  just build my own pack but I lack the experience and inventories.. working on it !

Thanks for that highly detailed reply!
Great stuffs there!
Highly appreciated

I do have basic soldering tools and skills, have had enough problems to fix every week.

Still considering if I go on the loop key solution / 50$ anti spark or something else (posted some idea of a 3 position switch in the forum)

Thanks again

Yeah, I saw that.

It would work, but your main issue by far will be finding a switch that can handle the 50+ amps we routinely draw from our batteries, in an economical and physically small package - Most that fit the electrical requirements will be physically large, and quite expensive to boot. There's a reason we as a community have settled on loopkeys: They're the cheapest, simplest, most robust and reliable solution to a thorny problem. No mosfets to blow, and if you do manage to fry the one resistor, it's a handful of dollars and a half hour of time to make a whole new one.

And if you do decide to go that route, I have a 3d printer and would be happy to print you out a mounting flange or other small accessories, for the cost of a few grams of filament plus shipping.
