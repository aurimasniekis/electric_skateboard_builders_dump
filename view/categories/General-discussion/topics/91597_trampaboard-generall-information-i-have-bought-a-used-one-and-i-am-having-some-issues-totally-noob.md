Hello!

I have bought a used Trampaboard and i am so dissapointed with it. If i start with full throttle, the belt jumps, and if i go full throttle for a few seconds, the power goes down suddenly. I would like to know if it is normal and this boards are not able to start at full throttle, and what can be the power shut off.
If someone of you know how to make a log of the vescs with the bluetooth module and an android device, or have some tutorial, will be great.

I bought it used because i have no time and wanted a ready to run one with battery and everything, and a i think that i made a wrong choice..:disappointed_relieved:

Best  regards.

This are the specs:

* Deck: 16ply 35º Holypro
* Motor mount: Trampa Pro Motor mount
* Trucks: Trampa Vertigo Trucks
* Wheels: Trampa Superstar 8 inch
* 2x original VESC 6.0
* Motors: 136kv TRAMPA Motor
* Battery pack: 12s5p Eskating.eu (Samsung 30q cells)
* Tires: 8 Inch HARD TRAMPA Treads Tyres
* Remote: MAYTECH
* 1x Trampa Bluetooth module
* 1x Vedder Antispark

And this is a picture of it.![1c3b2958-c62f-4815-bce4-6b1e020dc584|375x500](upload://jHN5WJB60RWNfQTomW8gTNoP0Lr.jpeg)

Try connecting both vescs to pc, update firmware and run setup wizard. Here's a video tutorial how to run detections https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtY75DGRPvA

When the belt jumps the vesc may throw an overcurrent error.

This can also happen if you lose traction and regain it suddenly.

Make sure the motor mounts are aligned correctly, if necessary tighten your belt, check for errors in the vesc terminal and come back with the results.

Did you ask the seller about it? He should be able to give some info. Did you bought it from @AgileCow ?

Maybe you need to tighten the idlers if the belt skips on hard accelerating and braking.

Reduced power could also be hot motors, touch them when this problem occurs.

Yes, we have had a conversation about it. 

I recommended connecting to the VESCs and collecting some log information, try running it in full speed mode unloaded for instance, and update the firmware. 

Admittedly I do not start with full throttle and I do not ride full speed for longer periods of time normally. The belts might need to be tightened after transport.

Also, since there were transport damages to the "VESC box" I cannot stress enough that they need to be diagnosed before we try to figure out what is wrong here. 

The belts is (to me) normal maintenance on a board such as this, start with tightening these, do a test and if you still have issues let me/us know

Yup, he did. 

It irritates me a lot that the board was damaged during shipping and that it is not performing as Javier wants to. I will assist in any reasonable way I can. 

@Javierpeba how has it gone? Did the belt tightening solve the problem?

I have the mounts, in the picture one of the motors seems have a bit of miss alignment; I suggest you to take some time and patience with this. Because if you tension too much the belt, under this situation, it will skip some teeth. Also the dropping power could be just a bullet connector from the motors, you should check everything, because it could be a just as simple like the receiver is a little bit loose. It is not about a tighten or loose belt, is about having patience to learn, use the board for a while, take some tools with you, until you find the balance...Also get into http://vesc-project.com and take your time to learn, there are manuals for everything. I went to the same process, with frustration first, but after that, is all about happiness and joy...

Forgot to mention, you need to realign that motor, use loctite, for that you need to take it apart, it is simple and necessary!!! If you have any questions PM me, you have a great board!

That there is a pretty advanced piece of kit for an entry into the life my friend.  Its a wonderful machine and as such will require some tweaks to keep in good order.  You have the board and now its time to learn how it works.  Good purchase and I'm sure when you get your head around it it will be everything you want.  Good luck.

Hello!

This morning i could work in the Trampa and  i see more things wrong, so i decided to unmount all the drive system and returnt to install it.

Like we see on this video, the left tyre didn´t turn smoothly.

https://www.youtube.com/embed/ebY9y7S7Oz8

The two printed belts cover was broken on the bottom, and at this point that my idea of a ready to run board were only a dream :sweat_smile:  i trash them to put another better cover in the future.

There is one missed bolt, some bolt without washer, and many bolts bad aligned,  forcing me to use the screw tap many times. This problem i think were caused because de motor cover, it disalign the system. So i will not to install it again.

![11%20(1)|375x500](upload://eySue6AS0lbSpPaPLcV9S69WBSz.jpeg) ![11|375x500](upload://rwPEIeBUvSOnfc1PCGsEtfl5sDo.jpeg) ![IMG_20190427_122016|375x500](upload://7Tzx0fhl2Zx4tmYgpp74eOTQm0V.jpeg) 

I found the belt was disaligned, and a bit lose. Should use loctite in this belt drive piece?

https://www.youtube.com/embed/eyZme6i_GPw

And a little stone incrusted.

![IMG_20190427_113420|374x500](upload://b4jBYsTl8sl79jAlESVoxxoAWJb.jpeg) 


The drive system it is like this right now. I am gonna buy the missed bolts and washers, loctite, and return to assemble it.

When it will be done, i am gonna to the next step, the electrical. I dont like the system, it requires to unmount the battery cover tu recharge it, and find this melted xt90 connector, so i will opted to check it everithing and put it by my hands.

https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q5TCa_Vzof0

I want to buy two belts for replacement and some air chamber. There will be any good option in aliexpress or similar web. Or i should go directly to trampa web?

Best regards!

That looks like it's from a slip of the sodering iron, not from malfunction. Sould be okay if the contact points look okay.

Hey mate. Make sure you get some grub screws for that motor pulley and loctite them into place. Good spot on the few bolts that werent fully secured. Regarding the XT90S, that's not from drawing too much current. It looks like a simple soldering iron slip. Keep us posted with how the firmware update goes.

Motor Pulley, loctite 638 or 680, to remove it torch it a little bit and use a cheap bearing extractor in the future. The grub screws of the motor mount have to bi tighten with patience, start from the top one then the opposite one then the right and then the opposite, not at once, go slow step by step repeatedly until is done, your have to use same loctite as motor pulleys. Let it cure for a night before hitting the road. Use belt loose, try to get as much free wheeling as possible, tension the belt slowly until you find the spot. Do not over tight the wheel 12 mm axel... Do not over tight any screw, the rest of the Allen screws just loctite 243. The Allen from the wheel hubs, I would not use loctite at all....just tighten them enough.  Smart decision on take in apart the board, you will learn a lot, I would not use the motor covers at all, motors need airflow....Wish you the best!

Aside from some of the truck mount issues, I discovered that the cause of my intermittent cuts came from the receiver connector getting intermittently disconnected by the batteries jostling around.

A little wire management goes a long way.

Hello to all!!
 I am writting to you while wait for a taxi. The trampa dindn't burned by miracle.
After finish the aligment that took me many time, i go for a ride to test, track it, and made some video for you. But after 9km it started to smell like something were starting to burn.
Like i didnt trust in this board, i carry with me an allen and i can oppen the box finding this :(.
I will text back on home...![15565628333363880323960214643630|374x500](upload://jRdUDfpKWpns6B0MmdQIt1VBVOo.jpeg)

Well, i am already in home , and the trampa too.

I didn´t risk to bring with me in the taxi the battery, because i touch it and started to make smoke. So a place it over a cement surface, untill i know how to manage it to trasport it to a recycling point ¿or should i oppen it and take a look?. I know this batteries will make a fast and powerfull fire, but i dont know if can explode and make and injury to me. I have more than enough worries with this board.. 
¿Maybe should i transport it in a pressure cooker?

In the other hand, i will need a new one battery, and maybe new chargers... I don´t need more than 15km of range with a fast riding. In Trampa web recommend the next ones. 

Turnigy Graphene Professional 12000mAh 6S15C LiPo Pack w/ XT90
https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-graphene-professional-12000mah-6s-15c-lipo-pack-w-xt90.html?___store=en_us

-ZIPPY Compact 6200mAh 6s 40c Lipo Pack w/ XT90
https://hobbyking.com/en_us/zippy-compact-6200mah-6s-40c-lipo-pack-xt90-1.html?___store=en_us

I think i preffer 4xZIPPY Compact 6200mAh 6s 40c and i can choose go for a ride with 2 units of it for less weight, or with 4 for more range. But i am a noob, and dont know if i miss something and will be better 2xTurnigy Graphene Professional 12000mAh 6S15C or another battery.

Regards!

This is not the first battery that catched fire from eskating... 
A guy in our swedish facebook group had his board turned into flames a couple of weeks ago. 
A close friend of mine`s battery broke after 1 ride and he´s still waiting to get it back from eskating. I think its been 2 months now.

My battery from eskating has been fine but these post´s make me worry.

Oh and you can forget about warranty from eskating regarding the battery...If you use it on diy you get no warranty unless eskating installed the battery. 
At least thats what the swedish guy with the burning pack was told...

@Javierpeba whatever you do, do not store them in the house. I have metal boxes that I use for long term storage and even bought a couple of battery safety boxes if something like this was to happen.

Bring them to a recycling station that can deal with them. We'll sort out the money on WhatsApp but for god sake, **be safe**  and treat these like a fire hazard right now. 

Again, very sorry that this happened to you.

Hi 1st off I'd like to say that it is a massive shame someone has sold you a Highly modified Trampa under our name. We stand by our Name and build quality.
I can see that it is clearly a Tramp Deck and motors but I also clearly see that the Speed Controller is not ours and the battery box is a modified Trampa Monster box.
I hope that this was all well explained to you before you purchased it. If you need any replacement parts or wish to restore it to an Original Trampa e-ATB you would be best off speaking to either @trampa or Trampaboards.com. we hope you get to enjoy your board soon best wishes Trampa

@TrampaDan as soon as somebody use a trampa deck as platform it is common to name it a trampa board. 

Yes, sorry, it´s not a Trampa pre build board how you can buy it on the trampa site, but that´s how it is named in here. 

I hope we now don´t get troubles naming our builds trampa build even if they not the pre build boards from the shop. 

In case we should name it better "board based on Trampa" than let us know, we don´t want to get troubles.

And last but not least, WELCOME! nice to have somebody elsee
 from the Trampa company in here besides Frank @trampa .

The speed controllers seem original vesc6 to me.

From what I can tell so far the majority of the problems originated from the battery. So far nobody had blamed Trampa quality.

Hi Dan! Welcome!

I do not appreciate you saying that I'm selling non-genuine stuff. That is an original VESC6, from Trampa. Regarding the batteries, you are free to recommend what you like. The VESC6 is configurable and has been set configured according to the battery being used, in this case the 12s5p from @fottaz 

I feel sorry that @Javierpeba got the screwed up battery from me and we have resolved the matter with some compensation. 

I understand that you want to protect your brand. It could be wise to recognize that your stuff is being used in a DIY context though. Nobody is badmouthing your equipment. It is excellent. The fact that it is modified is another story. That's like saying "Hey, your car is not a Nissan anymore because you modified it"....

All I was trying to do by joining was hopefully help a boarder that had problems you are right they are Trampa vesc. I'm not to sure what that massive plate is with all that cabling around the motors is I guess I jump to conclusions and asummemed that was a none Trampa 3rd party speed controller. Again sorry. Now as I said it is a heavily modified trampa and not a stock model. I am not here to flame or be flamed on if this is the case I'd rather sit it out and spend my time more constructability. I'd like to join a community where we all work to perfect our boards

That massive plate houses the vesc6. Apparently the original owner could not fit the battery inside the monster box, so he modified it and moved the vescs to the rear in that box.

Most people here appreciate the presence of a manufacturer's representative. There will always be some that will whine and bitch but you can't please them all.

A few pointers from me:
* Never put a competitor's product down even if it is shit. Highlight your product's advantages but avoid direct comparisons.
* Always properly assess the problem. eg A modification of your product does not necessarily mean that it was the cause of the problem.
* You can't please everyone. Avoid getting into a conflict.

Again, welcome.

The reason I mentioned the modification is we have tested an extremely large amount of prototypes to get to where we are today and the complete package that we sell have had a lot of time put into them to get them right. Once you start to change the components we do not know for sure how that will work a long side our components. This make fault finding harder. I'm definitely not trying to put other brands down or even self builds as this is exactly how our own research and development then our 1st e boards came to be, yes we had the Trampa ATB at its core but the rest was all built from trial and error. I'm sure if we all help each other we all benefit as the sector grows and technology improves. Again thx you all for the warm welcome.

Hello!

I have fresh news. I was lucky, and unlucky this days. I found a new friend with knowments in batteries, and i give him the semi-fried battery and he oppened it, found that the bms was melted, and melted a cell too. 
![49|375x500](upload://8Hh70qWFJ2ICHNBMNOd1O1wNm7d.jpeg) 
![27|375x500](upload://scB8bdy3Nhf05CL49l4T7ZtUJfz.jpeg) 

We think that this BMS should have a heat dissipattor.


He replaced the bms for a new one with a lvc bypass because it was 60a, and a cell because it were damaged. He advised to me that this battery pack will not be too powerfull and will not last too long, but i thought that at least i could ride meanwhile wait for a new one.

![26|666x500](upload://hhEWFoOVcN9pViNP1d3ktuJBpwx.jpeg) 

I was so happy, thinking that finally i could use my Trampa-build, but it had another bad surprisse for me. I take it from his house, and before carry it to the car, i couldn´t wait to test it. So i start the ride without any protection, i saw that the board runned well at full throttle for about 2km, and when i was near the car in a full gas acceleration and confidence with my body possition for full gass, i have a cut off.
I had no time for reaction, i could put out the rear foot, but the front one was not possible. I crashed hard in hands, elbow and femur. I am greatull that were a pedestrian that wait with me for my girfriend to take me. I have many crashes in my life and some broken bones, but never losted the vision without a head hit like this time, everithing gone bright white some minuts. 
After that, i thinked in sell it and forget mi idea of a mountain board, make an electric downhill bike, and continue with my loved chinese budget boards. Everything were problems since i have it...

But now, with injuries but calm, i am gonna give it the last try. I have ordered a 12s4p sony vtc5a with a 120A Bms. and I will ride it with my motocross full gear only.

And will make the downhill ebike, i love electric skating, and love downhill with bikes, but the bikes are safer than a mountainboards, better brakes, better suspensiones etc... so if i enjoy both the same, maybe sell the trampa. Lets see with some time.

Thanks a lot to all for the good advises and hope you safe ridings!!
