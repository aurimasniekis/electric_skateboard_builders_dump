I wanted to create a Wiki Page for riders who want to invest into safety gear

It's not so easy to know what you should/could buy and there aren't really threads for it, so I'll try to solve this

Due to some bad falls I’ve experienced with breaking bones 🦴 to pinching nerves... this is one part of gear I now use.... covers chest, back, shoulders, arm, elbow, forearm.... https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B075K9KVVC?psc=1&ref=yo_pop_mb_yo_pop_mb_pd_t2

I wore a similar piece for a few months before I got my Lazyroller hoodie. Did you ever end up crashing in it? I can't imagine it would be very protective but I had a China knockoff so IDK.

No I haven’t had any spills in it YET... lol but experiencing a few fall in different manners I feel confident with it on... and I selected to go this route rather than the hoodie gear is bc of the shell padding... when/if I fall again I want to slide & not get “hooked” on the ground...so I’m mindful of that when selecting my padding...

One of the bones I broke before was in my hand so I also wear these MBs gloves... but only on the previously injured hand 🖐🏾.... https://www.mbs.com/gear/hillbilly-wrist-guard-gloves-black-half-finger

And I use one of these on the hand that I hold the remote with lol...doesn’t offer that same protection as the MBs but it’s something and it has some metal buttons (shell like) on it...again what i want in case of a fall so my hands slide out.... https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B0751BJKWW?psc=1&ref=yo_pop_mb_yo_pop_mb_pd_t2

I think g-form pads should be included too. I have the soft foam version but I’m pretty sure they recently came out with some hard shell versions

That's why I didn't include them, but yes, they got a new slide version

And for Ruroc Helmets, the mouth piece isn't certified and I heard it can get of when you slide over the ground wich would make it useless - and for that price...

leatte and demon hips are mediocre for our impact style, orher options like triple 8 are bulky.  Should use: 

Hillbilly hip pads as it is the only pad with full iliac crest, tailbone, and femur ball joint coverage

Your hands and gloves are empty. 
Street hands:
Sector 9 Lightning(the best), Thunder, or Boxer II
Rayne High Society V2

Off road hands:
Mechanix Leather Hide gloves with wrist guards
Hillbilly Gloves with wrist guards

Knee: The only real option is TSG DHP for street.

Vest: you have one of my favorites listed, the leatte 5.5 body protector - which is the only built in shoulder protector around.  EVS Street vests are great too but no shoulder.


Ankle: Gform ankles with kevlar socks, or wear proper mid top skate shoes

Elbow: TSG Pro, they dont slide on impact due to the cup design, unlike others which are open scoop plastics.

thanks so much for all the input!

For gloves, I didn't really now which ones are suited -> can you take the slide pads off from the sector 9?

Knee: whats bad about the leatt knee shin guard? - i see that the dual axis is shit, will remove it

Elbow TSG Pro, hmm.... looks good for beginners, but would like it to go further up and down the arm

OMG, I was searching for this picture!!!! Thanks mate!!!!!

yes you can take the slide pucks off every skate glove, as they wear down and need replaced. I listed my favorite (the lightning) for street, Because unlike all the others that are full leather or kevlar finger tips, the finger tips on Lightning are Neoprene and wear better when sliding, these gloves should last years. 

the leatte knee shin  is really great for terrain boarding, id leave the street abrasion to TSG DHP

further up and down the arm for elbows is fine, most forearm protectors slide as they dont have a good lock on the elbow - best bet is to just rock a leatte5.5. Just personal experience, Ill take road rash on the forearm over a broken wenis.

Aren't the Secotr 9 Thunder produced anymore -> product isn't on their site
[These mechanix?](https://www.mechanix.com/durahide-m-pact-impact-leather-work-gloves)

yes that's true, but I guess not everyone wants to invest in such a vest

The stock comes with CE level 1 pads, back, shoulder, elbow. I upgraded mine to CE level 2 D3O pads for extra protection. If it works, I don't know :man_shrugging: never took a fall

what's better: a vest like the leatt body protector 5.5 or a leather jacket/suite?
I see many pics of (e)skaters showing or wearing their leather suits, but didn't read about them in any safety discussion yet
I guess a leather jacket with inbuilt pads comes close or is better - depends on what you compare with - than a protector vest

Any knowledge or experiences?

I wanna put a good word in here for:

**Hand / Full Gloves:**

* [Loaded Freeride v7](https://loadedboards.com/freeride-glove-version-7/)

**Upperbody / Vest**

*  [Leatt Body Protector 3DF Airfit](https://www.leatt.com/shop/moto/upper-body-protection/body-protector-3df-airfit2.html)
Low-profile, under-the-hoodie option for those who don't want to look like Robocop. High CE-l2 protection on back and chest, CE-l1 on elbows and shoulders. Saved me more times than I like to remember.

**Knee**

*  [POC Joint VPD 2.0 DH Knee](https://pocsports.com/eu/joint-vpd-2.0-dh-knee/20375.html)
*  [Fox Racing Launch Pro D3O Knee](https://www.foxracing.com/launch-pro-d3o-knee-guards/18493.html)

**Hand / Openfinger-Gloves**

...and I want to warn against the _Flatland3D E-Skate Glove._ They're just super-flaky. The 'pucks' or the armour or whatever they're meant to be, is in the wrong place and the material isn't abrasion resistant so they fall apart pretty quickly. This is what they looked like after one or two light scuffs:

If they were a quarter of the price, maybe, but for that sort of money, go for the Loaded's.
