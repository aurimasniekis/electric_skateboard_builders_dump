Ok, so I've done a few hours of scrolling on this forum about if you can fit dual 6374 motors with 15mm belts on a TB 218mm truck. Some people said that dual 6374 only works with up to 12mm while some other people say that 15mm belts are fine. Do factors like the motor mount matter into the spacing? I just want a difinative answer because I already have a 15mm drivetrain on my current board with 6374 and want to know if I can just buy another motor, same drivetrain, and the TB 218mm trucks and I'm good.
Note: I have the EskatingEU carbon fiber motor mount if that helps.

I was just going to make topic with same question! Also would be nice to know if there are options for 15mm dual 6374 with surf rodz-trucks.

Maybe this topic could include list of compatible sets for dual 15mm 6373

I commissioned @scepterr , before his Illment (get better bro) , to make me a belt drive using his 6374 Dark Motors. 

Le specs are: 

Dual 6374 
30 : 15 Ratio 
83 mm wheels
15mm Belts I think

You can, in fact.  I have some photos here.  These fit dual 6374 and dual 5984

The Supercarve trucks are even better.

These fit dual true 6374.  Not the 5984 that is called the "Turnigy sk3 6374"

All of my belts are 15 mm. The motors have nothing to do with belts. Length of the trucks and wheels are the ones who can affect on the belts. All my builds have plenty of room for 15mm

The motor length and truck length and belt length all do affect one another.  You can't really say the motors have nothing to do with this.  If the motors are too long, they won't fit between the wheels....

I may have explained It unproperly. As long as the trucks fit the motors ( Two 6374 for example) the problem  is beyond the mounts. That's where wide wheels could affect on the belts and not the motors. Makes more sense now?

That's not true.

(motor1 length + motor2 length + belt1 width + belt2 width + mount1 thickness + mount2 thickness) must be less than the distance between the wheels.

I weigh about 300lbs and I have a dual 6374 set up on 12s running 100motor amps and -80 amps for braking and I ride my boards very hard I've never had a belt skip even with full brakes on my 12mm set up. 15mm belts are over kill for most.

I personally want to run to 6374 on 15 mm belt as well. What are some trucks and mounts that I can use with that set up? I prefer ot to be a longboard and not mtb

These are the most economical trucks for going dual 6374. Most caliber style mounts will work, they are a little larger in profile than original caliber.

They will fit without an issue.

This is a build I have on the go at the moment, dual 6374 with AT wheels and 60T wheel pulley with 15mm belts. That assembly is a lot wider than 107s with a 15mm wheel pulley.

How much vertical clearance do you guys have from the motors -and did you have any issues with it?

I've just started building a dual 6374 and I'm somewhat concerned about how close to both the road and the deck the motors are, even with 107mm flywheels.

Using a Never Summer Commander 2014 deck which has a rather long space between the designated truck holes and the edge. I could move the truck further back so that the motors can stick out but not sure if that would be a good idea either, since it's already a long deck.

I just built an eskate, and so far it’s not going as expected... it is
-dual 6374 3550watt 70a max 
-12s4p 30q 518wh 60a max 
-Tb 110 wheels 16/36 15mm belts
-Focbox unity 
.. my question is about efficiency and top speed, I’ve only been able to get it to 31mph and my watt hours are 28-30, I’m getting like 13 miles of range.. I expected more out of a 12s4p. My goal is to go at least 40mph and have 20miles of range, is this realistic for my build or not? Also I noticed a huge drop in power once my battery got to 25 percent, any help would be much appreciated. 
Thanks,
Tyler

@TMC You should be getting 25-30 mile range off of a 12s4p 30Q. You should be hitting 35+. You will get a drop of power around 25%. Typically, I prefer not to ride below 25% and if you do.. you don't want to over throttle/accelerate as much. The best time to do heavy throttling is when the pack is full vs when the pack is empty.

Thanks, good to know I shouldn’t run it under 25 percent.. I just don’t know why I’m getting the stats I am out of it, everything is new and I only weight 170 pounds so I should be flying.. I’m gonna fully charge it and re-test my stats, but do you think my values are good or should I change any settings In the Focbox unity 
-70a motor limit
-60a battery max discharge? Also, another thing that could be a problem is that I am using an iPhone X with the Xmatic application so it makes me wonder if the app isn’t accurate with the stock unity Bluetooth module.. at first I felt like I was going 40 but the app stated my max was 31

maybe check your belt tension.

are you going up many hills?

Also depends how you ride. 
Lots of stopping them heavy acceleration will drain it faster.

I left about a quarter inch of slack on the belts, I wasn’t 100 percent sure how tight they should be so I just figured I would be fine leaving slight slack

Not many hills but I have been riding it kinda aggressively, I’ve never actually ridden one before building it so I Haven’t been pushing it as hard as I want to yet
