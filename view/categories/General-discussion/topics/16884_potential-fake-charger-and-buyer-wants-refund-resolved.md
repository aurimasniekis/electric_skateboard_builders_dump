I sold him a "fake IMAX b6 charger" and he wants a refund which I am willing to comply with however first It would be helpful if the community can verify that this charger is cheap and useless and how I should go about this return. It's only $15 so I'm not angry or anything but I am trying to work with a customer threatening to take PayPal protection action or somethingðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚

If theres a serial number you can look it up to see if its genuine or fake.

The serial number is on the holographic label on the back, you can look it up here: http://www.skyrc.com/antifake/indexen.php

Yes. I bought a charger from Will. 
I requested for him to verify it was an authentic SkyRC iMax B6, reason being that the fakes are known to overcharge batteries. I asked of him to provide pictures of the back as the chargers originals have a hologram sticker with the serial number on them, to which he replied, "I checked it and it's authentic" I figured I would trust him and went ahead with the purchase. 

As some others in the forum have noticed and can attest, I am pretty anal about protecting my batteries mainly because it's part of my full time job and I've seen how much damage an exploding battery can do. 

Here are some pictures of the authentic.

if you described it as  SkyRc and it is a fake, Then you described it incorrectly and  should pay for return shipping.
Because it is not as described and that is sufficient cause for a PayPal claim.

There are several things you can notice straight away, no mention of SkyRC and no hologram sticker in the back. After doing research last night, it turns out that the fakes leave the protection part of the circuit unpopulated and also tend to overcharge cells as they use lower quality parts. 

I have not done anything other than opening the box it was shipped in and take pictures of it to send to Will. If I run it with a multimeter attached I am sure I can also prove that it overcharges, but I really don't want to use it even once. 

I offered Will for us to split the cost of me shipping it back. It was his mistake but I am also not an Ahole that doesn't understand that mistakes happen. We would both lose money from the transaction but it would be even. 

He refused, said that he would not pay for return shipping nor he would refund my money until I had shipped it back and he had verified that I had not tampered with it. 

I said "That's not okay for me" and explained that I could either get a refund and both of us lose a few bucks from the transaction or I could file a paypal claim, from what I've read online they require that you destroy the fakes in orderto process a refund. 

So it came down to we both lose a few bucks for a crappy transaction (which I was not at fault for) or I ask paypal for my money back and he not only loses the charger but also gets a ding to his account

I am not angry with @willpark16. He sold me some other parts which I would not be able to complete my girlfriend build without but as stated before take battery protection very seriously.

I understand it's only $15 but it's also money I could use to buy my puppy meds or take my girlfriend out to the movies. I work hard for my money and some may think it's ridiculous but I stand my ground.

I'm sure he thought that he was in fact selling an authentic SkyRc charger.
Shame on companies that produce and sell counterfeits that are not easily identified as such.

You should take it up with amazon then, unless it said in the ad there as it being genuine.

A good tip when buying from Amazon.\
If the item is shipped by Amazon, even if its from a 3rd party seller. Amazon will stand behind it and if there is a problem, Amazon will make it right.
If the item is sold and shipped by 3rd party, Amazon will not stand behind it.

Only items shipped by Amazon are Prime eligible so they should make it right.

The problem is that you will have to solder to the batteries and there is the potential of damaging the cells with excessive heat.
Welding nickel strips with a spot welder happens so fast that it doesn't over heat the cells.
I have soldered ni cad cells together with gold plated bars back in the day but I used a  360w Weller soldering gun.

i think 12ga is a bit too thick because its so thick so it wil take longer to heat up and cool down

I saw a video about soldering vs spot welding and the guy opened the cell after performing both and saw that soldering makes the paper roll inside the cell damaged along the edge of the wrapping versus the spotwelding that did minimal staining.

Welding is definitely the way to go
