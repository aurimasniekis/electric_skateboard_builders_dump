Hey guys,

I found myself frequenting the forum less and less as the winter nights rolled in and the DRV blew on my VESC 4.12 last year. Now the suns coming up, I've primed my board to replace the VESC with a FOCBOX I've had sat in the cupboard since a group buy and I just wanted to say it feels good to be involved again! Can't wait to catch up on whats available in the market now, and what parts I might have missed.

I also saw the untimely loss of an inspiring bloke here, and was glad to see the community respond so positively and support everyone involved.

It's hardly a giveaway, but its all I can offer in my return. If anyone (UK preferred) would like a VESC 4.12 with a blown DRV chip just sling me some postage money and its yours. Or are them particular VESCs dinosaurs now? :joy: (FYI There's no connectors on it either)

I'm ready for summer! :sun_with_face:
