I'm actually going to build my little cousin a supercharged one of these ride-ons with old eboard parts. 

They are on craigslist all the time either broken, or beat up in one way or another for less than the price of caliber trucks.. 

I think it'd be a hell of a fun project, and the kid would be living the dream drifting around at 10-15mph max. Heck, I had one of the ride-on jeeps when I was little, and it was honestly the coolest toy you could imagine as a 6yr old.
