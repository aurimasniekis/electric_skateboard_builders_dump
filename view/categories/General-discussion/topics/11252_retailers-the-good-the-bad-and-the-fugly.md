What's your experience with your local retailer? Help fellow E-Boarders meet decent folk and avoid pitfalls where ordering direct from the manufacturer isn't possible or desired.

I got my Evolve Carbon GT from Bill V at Skater HQ in Manly. 

Awesome guys, let test out the old and new generation boards and has always been extremely passionate and helpful + got me a board quicker than Evolve could get one too me. Highly recommended!

I can't speak to buying a complete esk8 from a retailer, but I needed a few connectors and some wire to finish my board off so I went to a nearby hobby store. Nice guys, but I ended up paying like 60 bucks for 20 Dean's connectors.
