Hey guys,

I'm ordering a bunch of enlcosures, you can order them now in pre-sale for €32,95 instead of €49.95 :slight_smile: Delivery will be end of May.

It's a simular enclosure to the ones we already have just a bit bigger :slight_smile:

Frederick, what decks will it fit? Can it be moulded in place with a heat gun?

it's a pretty standard concave that will fit most decks, if you add some rubber sealing you will have a nice sealing :) Don't have experience with heat gun moulding, wich deck do you want to use?

kind regards
Frederic

Dont have landyacht decks here but if the space between the drop downs is 55cm + it should be ok :slight_smile:
