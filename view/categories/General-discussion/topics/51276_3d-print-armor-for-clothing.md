What are your thoughts on 3d printing custom armor parts to go into clothing? I'm cheap but I do have a 3d printer. My armored shirt cost me over $100 which is why I only own 1. I have nylon filament, abs, and pla that I can print with. Any thoughts on that, good or bad? Essentially all they are is a piece of clothing with pockets for the armor inserts. Possibly could even be snapped or velcro-ed into place.

Way better than nothing

And just not as durable as regular armour

That's cool. But I think body armor has less specifications to it. I have a little bit of flexible filament though. I'll leave the helmet stuff to the experts lol.

Yes definitely leave to experts. But 3d printing pretty much has endless opportunity

How many of you wear slide gloves when riding? Having a controller in your hand isnt exactly conducive to using that hand for sliding or sliding upon bailing. 

Related to printing and protection in general, specifically slide pucks, I've been planning on printing out an adapter/interface that fits my controller between my palm and the puck. Since the main thing I do when bailing off a longboard is slide to a stop on my hands and knees, I don't feel comfortable giving up this ability because I have a controller to use.

As for armor on your body, when I was younger my friend and I melted a bunch of cutting board all over a jacket and pants, and used that before we got our hands on second hand leathers. The jacket and pants we made we're actually pretty effective since they would tend to slide between the cloth ripping itself to shreads, as opposed to leathers gripping and flipping you like a ragdoll on more gnarly pavement.
 
If you are smart about where you put the armor, it does work. The jacket we used got torn up way before the cutting board, so you could probably fasion yourself a really slick looking single (or few) crash use armored suit, where filament would probably take damage around the same pace as the usable life of the jacket / pants you put it on under crash conditions, or design the armor to be modular somehow for easy replacement- Velcro even, but that might be pointless if you are just using regular clothes. Make sure to get good coverage, you never know how you are going to fall, and consider padding under the armor plates. And also knowing that leathers and purpose made protection is always going to be better, which you can get relatively cheap second hand if you look on Craiglist or eBay.

Nylon would probably be your best bet if you can manage to print it wide enough without it warping off your plate before you are done printing... It's naturally slick,  really tough, and semi flexible, which I though would be better than landing on rigid and brittle PLA.

Edit: I just realized that I think you meant armor, like chest and bone protection type stuff, not abrasive resistant type armor... If that's the case I have no idea... I wouldn't trust something home made for that purpose.

I was thinking of doing the armor in the shoulders, elbows, back and possibly knees. Making them modular to work with different clothing. Perhaps doing the velcro or snap method and wrapping it in some then foam. The last accident I had I landed on my shoulder and hand pretty good. I'll check out second hand stuff though. I hadn't thought about that.

Not many, you'll need to cut your puck...

The thing is, when I was in the store today, I saw a shirt similar to this https://www.revzilla.com/motorcycle/knox-defender-elite-mki-shirt where the shirt was thin mesh but the was armor built into the back, shoulders, and elbows. But it's about $300. I refuse to believe it costs that much to make lol. Like I could use a lightweight shirt for probably $10 and armorize it for free with the printer I vs in my basement. And probably custom fit it to my body.

Signed, 
The cheap lady

In my defense, I've been creating useful things in fusion 360 for a few months now and have been getting better at it. This seems simple enough. Not like some of the crazy sports cars and sculptures people model these days.

If you have an Xbox Kinect, look into using that to scan your body into a 3D model... Works great and super fast and easy to get 1:1 scale models of body parts for reference, probably good application here for making custom tailored armor.

Or make your own pucks, which is honestly a good chunk of people prefer. At least those with access to materials anyway.

But are there other ways to effectively use both slide gloves and a remote?
You can't do an emergency shutdown slide with a remote in your hand. Maybe you could, but I haven't tried it.

I was thinking you could have a remote a bit like the Power Glove.

That would be so bad.

Something I haven't seen addressed yet is the way something is printed and how that affects its use. Basically,  pretty much any filament you use is likely to "shatter" along the lines of the filament on impact (I don't know what happens with flexible filament).
This has the potential to go from being a piece of safety equipment to small plastic splinters driving into the fabric of your clothes- at best. It doesn't matter that it's plastic, at high enough speeds, breaking shards of the stuff can easily be sharp enough to do significant damage.
All this applies more to consumer grade FDM printers, I suspect that industrial ones, with their microscopic levels of accuracy and wider range of materials will have less issues with this.
My advice, for whatever it's worth, is to test your designs thoroughly on a manaquine or something similar. Think like how car companies test safety equipment. 
Just to be clear, I love this idea and I'm curious to see what you do with it but it always bears repeating that with safety equipment you MUST. NOT. COMPROMISE. _EVER_.

The little research I did said the hard armor is made with hard plastics. I'm leaning towards the nylon filament though since it's the most durable that I have. I made a Pulley out of it and others on here have as well. I do agree with you as the industrial printers would be more accurate. They may even be molded. 

I also kind of see it as a way to wear some protection rather than none if it's too hot for my thick armored shirt or it's in the wash, or whatever random reasons. There would be something else I could throw on. Especially if I could manage a way to just throw the armor in my other clothes so I don't have to wear the same thing every time. Because, style lol.

That's what I meant, either cut a old puck or cut your own. You are right you cannot do a shutdown with a remote. But you can cut a puck to still support the base of your palm like mine. And drop the remote and shut down still. :) 

Better then no puck and going through your glove in half a second

These are what I have:![15229383673654311478622288946450|666x500](upload://6GqXOuk8Ktk5vh6xQPXiQTVdGh0.jpg)

They're like motorcycle jackets, but intended for bicycles. The jackets themselves are little more than a mesh covering, extremely light and breathable. The armor pads are pretty flexible but I don't know what plastic they're made of. They have Velcro so you can adjust them quite easily.

I think you would have a much easier time making the pads out of 1/8" abs with a heat gun. 

Cut the shape you need, for a shoulder for instance, then make your kids wear an old coat, lay a folded towel on their shoulder, apply heat to the piece, then using gloves, form it to the shape needed.

Glue foam and velcro to it and go from there to make them removable.

Or rivet them to the outside and be done with it.

Use zip ties to connect individual pieces together for articulation for knees/elbows.

You'd think that, but surprisingly no.

Again, I wouldn't use it for a motorcycle, despite what they claim, but for a bicycle or any speed under about 30 kmh I'd say it's reasonable. Of course, I'm also using a proper helmet, knee pads and wrist guards.

That knox defender shirt uses CE level 2 armor, which is certified to disperse impact energy. Its soft and pliable to wear, yet hardens and distributes energy upon impact. It's also abrasion resistant so it doesn't heat up, wear away and fuse to your skin when you're sliding along the ground. Maybe its not worth $300, but its not cheap to develop such technology that is certified to protect you. 

But CE level 2 is probably overkill for eskate. Although for shoulders and back, it could mean the difference between breaking them and just bruising them.

Armour for impact protection needs to have some 'give', I think nylon will be too hard unless you are putting d30 or something inside? Be especially careful about trying to armour the spine, because hard armour can do more harm than good in a fall if it puts the force unevenly into only a few vertebrae.
