it shouldn't be for best looking remote, rather most reliable remote after recent issues.

I understand, I love these contests. What I was trying to say is that we need a bigger community effort to find a remote that won't put anyone on harms way.

Ok, so maybe not the best looking but the housing is temporary until I get my 3D printer vaguely reliable.

Maybe I'll get a vote for most unusual.

I think it's this one but they don't sell it to the public. I wish a competitor would make something like this using the GT2B reliability.

Haha I already have it in the 3d printed case, I was just showing the guts.. 

It's a lot less gun-like than the gt2b original form as well.

(snif) I'm so proud!  I'd like to thank the academy, my co-stars, Alicia Vikander, the Oscars committee and, of course, the Esk8 community without whose support I wouldn't be here today.

Actually the one in the glasses case, first is hilarious, and second appears to have gotten more votes than I did, and it looks like he really needs the tool, so I would like to cede my prize to @ndwallick
