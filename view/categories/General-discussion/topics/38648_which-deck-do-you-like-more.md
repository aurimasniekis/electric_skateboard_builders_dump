I'm at toss up between

that deck and
https://funboxskate.com/product/suzie-slide-through/
I'm leaning towards the first one since the bacon style concave gives me a better spot to mount my enclosure and looks like it locks your feet in well.
the bottom will be wrapped with 5D carbon vinyl and top painted matte red with hexagon griptape

Which trucks and wheels? Wheel bite sucks, if you're gonna have to run risers on the 1st deck Id go for the 2nd.

running 97mm clones with 195mm paris v2's

I'm perfectly fine with risers ( I used to run 1" risers :joy:) I am really just after a deck the will fit my 9" wide enclosure from @psychotiller

oh yea, I also think with the wheel wells and the way it slopes up at the back I should be able to run without risers

I personally hate having my deck any higher than necessary but if you are cool with it ðŸ‘Œ. Deck one wins in style points imo.

My parents were pretty well off, just traditionally cheap. If my dad was still alive he MIGHT beat me for being into this expensive hobby... Funny thing is, he was an electrical & mechanical engineer. He never bought me toys, he just made them

Well it shouldn't be too hard considering the 405 enclosure you ordered is only 8 3/4" flange edge to flange edge.
