Can anyone point me in the direction of a 3A charger for a 10s4p 30q battery and a 5.5 x 2.1 port?

I’m looking for something like this, but with fast shipping.

PSA: do not buy

These are steaming piles of shit that, at best, will quit working after a couple months, and, at worst, will burn your shit down.

These are **by far** the best 10S chargers if your battery can take a 4A charge.

enertion (@onloop @CarlCollins ) used to also sell them, but they no longer do.

Your profile is missing your country, so we automatically assume Tanzania or Antarctica

Anything a bit cheaper? I can’t afford more than $50 right now and need to charge my board

You can get the cheap one and risk burning your house down or having an expensive paperweight.

Evolve used to sell a 2A version that is equally as good, and slightly cheaper, but they don't carry it any longer.  Metroboard has a 2A one but it isn't the really good one.

$50 can’t get me a good reliable charger?

The 2A version of that charger is what you want, but I don't know anyone who sells it anymore.  Mine isn't for sale.

Look for a used Evolve slow charger.

Yeah I’d rather 2A or 3A - I don’t need super fast charging and would rather try to prolong my battery for as long as I can

I've been looking for a 2A reliable 10S charger for about a year and haven't found any other one.  The 


Those ones I mentioned don't float either.  They disconnect after full charge and don't keep 42.0V applied.

Wouldn’t disconnecting after full charge be good? So you don’t keep charging it back to 100% constantly?

Sometimes if you're way out of balance on a very large P-count pack you might want it to stay connected.  Most of the time it's better to disconnect.

You can plug a voltage gauge into the charger and watch what it does

Some just go straight to 42.0V, some turn on and off and on and off until you plug into a battery, then they start charging.  Those are the better ones.

Would this work?

I’m not asking if it’s a bad charger, just if it’s the right voltage and everything for a 10s4p

That's the same shitty china one with a different label on it.

Are you saying that the label claims are just lies and it’s not the voltage or amperage it says it is?

I'm saying it looks like it came from the same factory, produced on the same assembly line, by the same people, but branded as a different brand.  I've had more than one of those fail, and looking inside, they are extremely low quality.

I thought I was crystal clear.

Don't buy them unless it's a broken charger you desire to have.

Not saying they are the same, but I’ve probably sold 50 of these between online sales and bundled with batteries, not one reported issue. 

They may be of different levels of quality tho

All I have is the chargers with the XLR plug but they are a different version from what’s on the site. 

If anyone is interested PM me

Buy Raptor 2.1 now, is it not equipped with a 4A charger?
Why did enertion stop selling 4A chargers?
Thank you.

That's a question for @onloop and/or @CarlCollins

It'd be handy for folks on that side of the globe to have an Evolve competitor.

Actually, Raptor 2 default Charger is 4 A and shape is also identical to this evolve charger :stuck_out_tongue:

They are just currently out of stock that's why they are off site.
They will be back soon.
