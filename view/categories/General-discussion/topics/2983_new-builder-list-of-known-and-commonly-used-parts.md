Great idea. Now all we need is a 3d configuratorinator!
Don't forget seismic speedvents 85mm,  and xt wheelz. 
Also, castle escs and hobby wing escs are still great choices for boards. probably still the most reliable too!

I was thinking just that. I don't know about a fancy one, but I could make a smaller builder tool that would make it easier to build a board virtually before actually buying parts. Part of this goal is to get a good list of parts so that I can make a data base of parts, to do just that :smile:

Great list @evoheyax! Let's add Abec Flywheels 107mm. We could also add some of the pneumatic wheels to the mix (skike 5 inch wheels, MBS Rockstars, and @psychotiller's hubs). In the bearings section, how about Bones Reds?

Sounds good, I'll be adding everything listed so far to the list very soon.

@minimorris77 Thats true, And I thought about that before. But What I'm mostly going to focus on are tried and tested batteries. I do want to weed out bad stuff (and certain batteries or even brands are not good). So that will be something that I'll think about (and I'm open to feed back about)

LG HE2, LG HE4, LG HG2, SAMSUNG 25R, SONY VTC (I think these are discontinued though. I think @onloop had a thread about suitable 18650s.

Ahh, good idea. I'm think a separate category for single cells and a separate for packs. This is meant to be a tool mostly for newbs, and I don't think many newbs will or even should build their own packs unless they have a lot of rc/electronic building experience. But I do want this to be something everyone in the community, newb or not, can use to help with their builds.

Thank you @onloop, this is the process. I think rather than saying everyone is too lazy to search, and we keep seeing the same questions over and over again, create a resource to point them all to, so we're not explaining the same thing over and over again.

i would add all SK3 motors here, 6374, 6364, 6355 with the various KVs!

also nearly everything from aliendrivesystems or soon alienpowersystem apparantly is missing as the only real EU source. they have kegel, seismic and abec gears / adapters with 9 and 15mm width.

also missing: http://www.esk8.de as the first EU supplier of vescs and they have motors, mounts and drive gears in 9 and 15mm too!


as for battery cells - the best contenders for large batteries arent here: LG MJ1, Samsung 35E and Sanyo GA

i would divide up the 18650 cells into 3 sections.


high drain / small capacity (30A/cell, 2500mAh): samsung 25R, Sony VTC5, LG HE2/HE4)
mid drain/mid capacity (20A/cell, 3000mAh): LG HG2
low drain / large capacity (10A/cell, 3500mAh): LG MJ1, Samsung 35E and Sanyo GA.

and then we have the lesser used 26650 A123 and LiPos for seriously large drain applications or fairly small batteries such as the boosted!

@evoheyax This is very nice. I wish this would have been up when I started getting interested in building my first board, would have saved me a month or so.

Would making the list into links be too much? It would probably avoid people from asking where to get them. 

And what about other sources for belts and pulleys/drives? I've seen a few others on some threads.

Catching up slowly but steadily.

@everyone The more specific you can be, the easier it will be to add stuff. It takes time to go to websites, pull stuff off, and throw it up. So listing specific parts to add is the quickest and easiest way for me to keep this list updated :)

Also, I'm trying to keep track of the details which matter, such as voltage and amps with electronics, and teeth and width with mechanical stuff. So the more of that, the better :)

I would usually suggest a tacon 160 but they are all gone unfortunately... They were hands down the best motor for its price of just 60 buxs but they are now gone. (I still cry :sob:) The best motor I could recommend it the enertion mono I have it an it is little better than my tacon torque wise but I never had a problem with torque where I live. I still strongly suggest you save up for an enertion motor because trust me in the end it will be worth it! Although it seems really expensive nothing (in my opinion) competes with enertion motors as they are made by the same place as my tacon 160. Seriously just save up.

But if you are desperate for a motor, Ollin Board Company's motors look pretty good and better than a sk3 turnigy motor from the pics. Still a great motor and I would recommend this one as the best sub 100 buxs motor.

No, haven't. 

You can get them directly from Maytech. I don't think they have a distributor and they don't have an online store so you have to do it by email. 

Email them for a quote: agnes@maytech.cn. 

They'll send you a proforma invoice with PayPal details and you can do it like that.

[quote="lowGuido, post:7, topic:870"]
Not only do they have soft power buttons that I hate.But they are louder than any other ESC i have tested under brakes, and here is the best part.. if anything strange happens during your skate the ESC goes into shutdown.  But not a nice soft shut down but a im gonna lock up the wheels and street your face kinda way. Not good.

I was thinking of starting simple, since building said tool will take a few days straight of coding. Luckily, I have a content management system I wrote a while back, which eliminates 60% of te code I would normally write. So it's just the new pieces of the puzzle I need to write.

I would like to scale up though to including product ratings and reviews, along with links to vendors who are known to sell said product. I can't give a time line yet, but it'll be a good summer project.

Just an update for all interested. The database is coming along well. I have a domain name setup for it, been writing a lot of back end code for the inventory management system today. Been working around the clock the last few days, and if I can keep up the pace, I will have something ready in the next few days. I'm working on an idea of creating virtual builds. So if you signup, you'll be able to create as many virtual builds as you like. I will have a system for users to be able to alert me (and who ever else I choose to make admin) to new stores selling any given product already in the system, to alert us of new products not in the system, and user reviews. I would l've one day to be able to create a 3d building tool, where you can virtually build the board in 3d (instead of the way it'll be now, where it'll be more so a checklist to make sure everything fits together and you have all the parts you need). I will try to keep with general prices of said items also, so you can compare builds before you ever buy any item to decided what works best for your budget. All in all, a beta release with some (but not quite all) of these features is right around the corner, so stay tuned :)

No it wouldn't. This is charging the pack to a much higher voltage as denoted by 10S vs 6S. I am sure there is a plentiful amount of brick style 6S chargers. Usually the lower the voltage the more common it is to find em. 

You might to make sure you have a BMS to charge with this charger. The BMS will balance your individual series up packs and will make sure the pack is charged at a safe Voltage and Current.

As Link said, it stands for Battery Management System. It basically makes sure that the battery is not overcharged or over discharged. BMS units can also balance the parallel packs in a battery. It essentially keeps your battery within safe operating limits for you. 

You can read more here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_management_system

These guys make some decent BMS units: http://bestechpower.com/

maybe y'all should reach out to a well known builders and give him/her samples to trial and let them document their build. A lot of my buying choices are influenced by the likes of @longhairedboy,  @RunPlayBack, @whitepony and others because they document builds that look great and there is video of them riding pretty hard.

@bartroosen12 I used those motors in my wife and kids board. They work very well. It's been about 9 months since they first road on the board with them installed. They ride there boards almost every day with no problems. Incline and torque is on the low end. It's best to push start before forward throttle. Once going it's a wonderful ride and  pretty fast. Especially for my wife and kids.I like these motors for them. Once I feel more comfortable with there skills. I'll move them up to something more powerful.

Sorry for the dumb question. But I didn't find it as obvious as you might think it is. But who is the guy referred to as DIY? If you Google that you get a lot of sites with diy in the address. Please post the exact website?

HobbyKing VESCs are good I have 2 and they work perfect no problems.  Excellent value for money and so far solid.  As long as you stay within their limits you will be fine.

Ebay from china. Unless you are buying 50 at once, then buy from a supplier in your country. Shipping is the killer so bulk is the only way to make it worth it

Does anyone know if the " Maytech Brushless 6374 90/190KV Open Cover Outrunner Sensored Motor" is the same as the R-Spec motors that Enertion sold? Seem kind of similar, but my biggest concern is if the quality is the same...
