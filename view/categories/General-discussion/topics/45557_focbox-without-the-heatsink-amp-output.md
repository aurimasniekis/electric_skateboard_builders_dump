didn't see a thread about the focbox without the heatsink.

  I though direct fets were more efficient and kept cooler than the old style and the old style were fine without heatsinks generally

A Good heat sink takes all the heat from something and distributes it on bigger piece of metal  I doubt it makes things worse

Without the proper dissipation, these mosfet can only drive around 30A.

30a continuous? for how long?  I'll stick on some other heatsink.

Probably not so long

Just remember that the top of those fet is conductor, so if they directly touch the heatsink, they are just going to blow up.

How is it different from the stock aluminum case. Which is a heatsink already.

ok thanks I have a bunch of little copper stick on heatsinks but I wondered about that.  

but how bout if I grind a hair's breath off the side of the pcb above big caps?  is there a trace map or something I could see 
Could just grind the plug a bit but rather not. 
This is 12s4p and also w 5p in other pics. Just the wires in the way(replace with foil underneath the esc), the white plug in the way, and a hair needed for the plugs how I want them. Charge port n loop key 
I could just grind the side of the plus ![image|374x500](upload://r28ucljD7RBxuyNSLo1mOSNyCTg.jpeg)![image|374x500](upload://82bUjFpifhcuBRPi8oxOfEWFZXC.jpeg)![image|374x500](upload://5TOkSATqUgRXk8XlzmcjBDmtTes.jpeg)![image|666x500](upload://wNcbfuFoX7sxEAWedsZj2OODZnv.jpeg)![image|374x500](upload://hRD9OseoAZQmE1sxLysJ5fBHdEG.jpeg)![image|666x500](upload://smTPFXmf9cY78Hs4tUpn5jXBXBf.jpeg)![image|666x500](upload://coQRYByDdFfrSp1J8hn7Rhv8SZk.jpeg)![image|666x500](upload://1GsLsWoOsLh0yKRlJqBz81r6BTA.jpeg)

You could just use Bullet-Connectors right?

xt90s loop key and charge port with bullets would be more complicated

I guess its doable, but without the protection of the X90s. Plus on 12s the spark would be just too strong :( 

In this post @whitepony explains how he did it:
