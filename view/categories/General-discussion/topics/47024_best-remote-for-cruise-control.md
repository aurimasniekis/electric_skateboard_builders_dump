Hi guys, 
I’ve been lurking this forum for about an year and without any technical skill I succeeded in building my custom 10S3P board. This says a lot about how good this place is to gather information. 
To me eboarding is 10-15 mph cruise control for 90% of the time and then touch the remote just to brake/throttle when needed. Safety is all.
That leads me to the question I got: what remote right now on the market should I purchase in order to have a good cruise control?
It should be a pocket size, thumb or trigger controlled, sturdy, reliable remote per se, plus (possibly) easy to configure. 	
I’m aware that the potting wheel mini remote works flawlessly with Ackmaniac Esc-tool, seems a bit bulky but I’m thinking about it.
Photon remote seems promising but it’s still in pre order.
Anything else to advise?

Steeze remote and mini remote via ppm are options.  According to the quick search I did.

A nunchuck nrf controller should work great!

The raptor 1 remote/Backfire 1 has cruise control. 
I do however think its very hard to find those.
