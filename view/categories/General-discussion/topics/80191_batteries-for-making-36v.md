That is too cheap to be made out of any good cells for our purposes IMO

12v -> 3s battery 
20 000 mah (high quality cells have around 3000mah)
20000/3000=6,6-> 7 cells

So that pack can be a 3s7p. That means 21cells. 
25euro/21=1,19euro each cell. 

I think it is unpossible to create a good pack like that with real specifications.

I wouldn't trust them. For battery packs, the old adage of "you get what you pay for" is especially true. Don't skimp on things that could potentially set your board on fire.
