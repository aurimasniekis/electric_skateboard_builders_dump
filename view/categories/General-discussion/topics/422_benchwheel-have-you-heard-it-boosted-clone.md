ive done some researching about diy and i found benchWHEEL dual motor kit with mounts and belts
and the price is cheap with 270kv 1800w*2 motor and aluminum mount for 299.99 + 12.00 for shipping fee 
anyways here is the link

This is intriguing.  One of the reviewers states that he uses two VESC's with this kit and that the motors are replaceable.  It seems like the kit without the motors is worth the price alone.  I imagine you could make an affordable 4 wheel drive setup with two of these.  As for is it a boosted board clone?  Definitely!  Look at their remote! C'mon! :joy:

All we need is a guinea pig from this forum to cough up the cash, buy one and do a teardown. Any takers ?

Looks like there's already a thread about it over at Endless-Sphere.  Both @torqueboards and @longhairedboy were part of that discussion.

yeah i'd love to test these out but i've got my cash tied up in premium parts for a build i'm planning to sell. 

they're definitely worth testing though. They may be ideal for builds for younger riders.

I found their completes. It's like $400 plus whatever the shipping costs. I wonder if it's worth buying and upgrading with 2 vescs.

I took the plunge and ordered their complete from Amazon.  It's only $549.99 with free shipping right now (probably for the holidays). For that price it seems like a nice platform for modding or upgrading. $550 for a DR setup, that's unheard of. It probably won't get here for a while. I'll keep you guys posted. Only time will tell if this was a waste of money or not.

lol I have just read the thread and actually own of this bench wheel board and currently trying to build another 1 from scratch. I don't know why those board from China always suddenly turned off and I need to turn them on several times while riding it. Their customer assistant said that the Bench wheel got 60A ESCs, they are using fresh new chips from Texas Instruments, FOC dina-wave controller meanwhile their stock battery is 6s4p. When I got the board early June,2015 it was all fun and good. Damn I hate when I must turn on & off frequently while riding it. I wonder if thats because of thermal shutdown or the signals from transmitter/receiver is weak. hmm

I was supposed to receive my benchwheel e-board yesterday, but unfortunately I was at work, and it requires a signature. Oh well. I have to wait till Monday to pick it up from dhl express. I'll see if I have a similar experience with having to constantly reset it although you did mentioned it was fine at first. Have you thought about modding it?

Yeah, they do look quite nice.  I received my board today. Pretty impressed by the quality. Haven't had a chance to ride it yet. The thing I noticed though was that the belts seem to be set rather tightly. There doesn't seem to be any way (that I noticed) to adjust the belt tension. Maybe @NIK can comment on that. Not sure if 3mm pitch is meant to be set tighter. I had set my belt tightly on my diy board which had an enertion kit, and the belt and pulleys got really hot really fast. I'm afraid that's going to happen here.

Yep i cant adjust the belt tension too. Happy ride bruv. Let us know when u have more experience with the board. Ouh before i forgot, once, i ride the board in rain. Haha that was fun. Now I'm using hot glue gun to seal every sides on the enclosure so no water will come in. Without the glue, the board can handle puddle easily.

Realistically,  if you know the belt size and pully size and never change the ratio you can set the motor the precise distance for best tension and not ever have to move or adjust it.

```
have a look here http://sdp-si.com/estore/centerdistancedesigner

so the belt is a particular length, and the cogs are a particular size now assuming you have a good quality  belt that doesnt stretch or change shape you can calculate the exact centre distance and cut your bracket to the precise size and never have to change the tension.

of course you can never change the gears to different ratios either.
im not saying its a great idea. just saying that it's a plausible configuration.

I finally got to ride it last night. Keep in mind I hadn't charged it, so it was probably half capacity. It was 40 degrees out here in Chicago. Lol I remember riding my motorcycle when it was 50 out once. That was bad. I couldn't feel my fingers. lol The acceleration is very slow and gradual (which is nice for beginners). I didn't have to push start even with my fatass. Not sure what my top speed was, but my diy board was way faster. The belts, pulleys, and motors never got hot (even though I felt the belt tension was too tight). The braking was like night and day even with these 50mm motors vs how my diy board was with it's single 63mm sk3 motor.

Maybe you can change the mode. If I'm not mistaken, there is "turtle" mode and "alligator" mode. Alligator is fast when it's chasing chicken.

## \#21 Posted by: NIK Posted at: 2015-12-23T16:17:42.579Z Reads: 262

Okay, basically, when you turn on the remote, (you can do this even without powering the board), push once of the RED button, it will switch from green top led to red lower led. But I think by changing the mode, you will just change the acceleration, from very slow to very fast. Be careful though not to sling shot the board. 

*I didn't connect to my board, thats why the bottom 3 LEDs is off and if you look real close to my remote, there's a scratch marks when I tried to downhill long boarding and hit something, fell off, a month Emergency Leave.

The first few rides were great, expect for the last one. The same thing happened to me with having to reset it constantly....I messaged the seller on Amazon about it since the manual says to contact the dealer about the flashing light. If I can't get this sorted out, I'll probably upgrade the esc with 2 vesc's. Hopefully the bms is separate from the esc. Maybe I'll get another battery for extended range.

Yeah, he said it was over current protection. Going from zero to full throttle and being really heavy will trip the over current protection. I don't think the new boards with the purple pcbs have the same problems as others have mentioned.

So I was riding at night on a street with no street lights earlier, and I was going up a driveway  Well this driveway had a mini curb that I didn't see since it was dark and I fell and hit the controller on the ground.  Now my controller doesn't seems to be working anymore.  Any time I turn the controller on, all the led's light up in sequence up and down repeatedly while it beeps every second.  What does this mean?  I don't hear anything rattling in the controller housing.  When I do get the controller to sync with the board, the wheels rev up by themselves.  Anyone have any this issue?  Waiting on a response from the seller.  @NIK  @Justin @sirjimmyvo

Same here, banggood could not give me a reason for not delivering but i guess it got stopped by customs (they are now issuing a refund). So i guess i'll go DIY all the way now :smile: 

@claudiofiore88 did you check the translated manual? I think it has a page with different error codes in it.

@Justin No, I haven't checked the manual.

@NIK the seller told me that he's sorry that my remote is broken and that he'd send me a new one after the festival because the shipping companies are on vacation.  I'm not sure if I'll have to send the broken one back, so I don't want to open it just yet

For $180 they are a reasonable set of dual motor trucks if you are on a tight budget. When Benchwheel came out with these (well over a year ago) they were considered the chinese 'equivalent' of the boosted board setup. 

Motors are fairly solid  5065 / 270kv. However servicing them is not easy brackets are welded and you can't adjust the belt. Your also pretty much stuck with the gear ratio..

Also look at Benchwheels remote (another boosted 'copy' and considered one of the better remotes for diy.
