**Vast Oceans & Borders is not a good enough excuse for bad service.**

The reason why Enertion is looking for German based is because theres no repair person yet in EU i believe. It's not because German engineering is top notch. Classification doesn't guarantee that. It's because currently Germany is a big market in EU with most buyers from Enertion side. So it does make sense to have German base repair person.

I have families, alot in German. I know about the technology and quality. But this is eboard, not car. Theres no need for German engineers to fix simple issue like wiring eboard, replacing BMS and such. Just because some Germans works well and engineer well it doesnt mean that every single German person work with the same ethic. I studied for 4 years within the German border, half of my class were Germans. Trust me not all, simply not all.

A classic NNGG!
Just spread some shit in the crowd and enjoy the show :D
Dude why are you always "anti everything" well known?
I will not jump the train and give pro Germany arguments because I think it's just not necessary and ridiculous.
Just do something useful and give some feedback from Hummies hub-motors and stop wasting you time with spam.
You seem to have some good knowledge so please share.

Well, I should have clarified, german cars with the exception of some audis have usually garbage reliability. Handling is not something I have experience, but have heard all too many anecdotes about BMWs, Mbenz, Vw. ect that spend more time in the shop than garage.  never throwing shit and dont have any hub motors for feed back. I dont overstep my boundaries and try to talk out of my ass.

Dear @EnertionSupport , 

I am writing to express my interest in the position of Repair Agent, advertised as being open at this time with your company. I have over 10 years of experience in technology sales and support, as well as technical support and I would love to bring my expertise and knowledge to your company.

In my current position as a Field Service Engineer at Tomra Sorting Solutions, I maintain high performance standards as I resolve equipment issues at customer locations, all around the globe. I do most of the troubleshooting for all the systems and make sure no work is delayed. Brand new installations,  updating on new software and remote support are also under my care.

My maximum life has been spent in working with electronic gadgets and mechanical objects. 
This is what I love to do, and hence I have built my career around this. I have a knack for problem-solving
and work well independently with little oversight. I am results-oriented, collaborative and committed to first-rate customer service.

Most importantly, I’ve been skateboarding since I was 10 and am passionate about everything related to
my favorite hobby. Being interested in durable energy and fast transportation too, I just had to get me one of your e-boards.  As a member of the esk8 community, I continue to expand my knowledge about the art of building electric skateboards every day. I have been experimenting with my own Raptor Dual and must conclude it’s an awesome board with some amazing technology!

Why I believe you should hire a Belgian repair agent, instead of a German?In addition to English, I speak fluent Dutch, French and German. This allows me to explore more markets and offer an even better customer service.  Plus, we all know Germans are drunk all the time. J
 
As a part of the Enertion team, I promise to bring first-rate customer support to your clients and support your business goals. I would bring a dedicated and hard-working attitude to this role.

Best regards,

Jeff Moreels a.k.a Skitzor

PS: I've also sent an e-mail to support@enertionboards.com including my resume.

That is such a load of BS.
Just because you heard stories doesn't make it so.
I suggest you come up with objective data to back your claim.

Urgh, agree'd @trbt555. @NNGG, that's the biggest load of crap I've ever heard. German products are well known to be some of the best in the world.

What is your reference base here as far as other car manufacturers go? Hyundai? Tata? Chana?

Guys please. This is about looking for members in Germany, not because of engineering quality. Simply because of there are potential market and multiple customers of Enertion resides in German. Do not derail the threads.
