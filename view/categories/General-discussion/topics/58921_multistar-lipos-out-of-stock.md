Does anyone know why Multistar lipos are just not being stocked anywhere?

I've been wanting to buy another 5200mah 6s 10c Multistar Lipo for 2 months now and they've been out of stock in hobby kings for over 2 months and any other shop I can find its out of stock. 

I know its a strange question but im really desperate.

They probably finally realised theyâ€™re shit batteries and stopped stocking them

Exactly any battery in parallel is not bad. Even a 2p 18650 pack is better and that should half of the amp output as what a 2p lipo pack should
