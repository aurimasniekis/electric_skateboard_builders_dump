That board looks amazing, I wonder how it rides? is it a lot more torquier that a 10S4P battery? Or are you doing it dor range?

How much does it weight?

I'm getting inspired by you with this build, I might do something similar but with a smaller battery for lower stance
```

@Eboosted   It ride amazing super smooth, it is a lil high off the ground but you get used to. Just have to put some  dampeners cus it‚Äôs Extremely curvy without them. And once you go over 25mph it feel a lil wobbly. 

It does has  torque it can get up some of the Steepest hill in my area with out any problem at all from a stand still It weigh around 22lb. 

Well it has a 10s8p battery pack in there as I love not having to worry about charging. When  I go out to ride lol all my boards are long range. I even have trampa street craver that‚Äôs 12s11p lol so range is the game for me. 

But I am not done yet with it I plan on doing some upgrades. To it once you finish with the  enclosure for the jet spud deck.

That 12s11p battery sounds amazing, u should show some phone of how big is it, unless u have crammed it in a box u rather not show to the world.

Otherwise really nice outcome for such handy / compact board no matter the pack size
```

@Okami Here it is it has 12s4p on the bottom Enclosure and 12s7p on the top on the box. To make one big battery 12s11p and and it can be unpluged to just run it at 12s4p. The rage on this bad boy so far I have gotten around 58 mile with out changing. ![image|666x500](upload://qI9Askh1qC0rQ1Vunqk1RM2tzgu.jpeg)![image|374x500](upload://8NKUbp2xXUTw9yXYU5tbepP9Kih.jpeg)![image|374x500](upload://ihdkCWmzZrW2xdUnAvrGHiAOv8R.jpeg)

Cool, not a bad idea, didnt imagine someone would combine underside battery with topside one. Good thinking :slightly_smiling_face:

Seems like u have good cooperation with Kaly, non the less :)
