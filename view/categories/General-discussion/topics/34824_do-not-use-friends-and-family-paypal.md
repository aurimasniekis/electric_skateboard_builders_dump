This has been mentioned several times across the forum within several instances of people ripping others off, but I feel that a thread that makes it super obvious might get people's attention faster.

**DO NOT, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, USE FRIENDS AND FAMILY PAYPAL FOR PURCHASES**

Here's why:
Business transactions via PayPal offer buyer protection for any item sold on the forum, and make it virtually impossible for someone to blatantly rip people off. If you use friends and family, you have no way of ensuring that your money wasn't just taken by a scammer. This forum has experienced several large group buy scams where people did not get their money back due to incorrect usage of PayPal. Avoid losing hundreds or even thousands of dollars by using business transactions - YES, the fee is WORTH IT.

Thank you to all the vendors that use this forum responsibly, let's keep it a safe and respectful environment for everybody.

Well you also have to tell the story from the other side then: as a seller friends and family is the only way to NOT get ripped of as the buyer can otherwise rely on the buyers protection and paypal usually decides in their favor. The seller ends up without a product and no money. This is actually a known scheme and the reason why I personally would never sell anything via paypal.
It looks like this:
As a buyer always PayPal.
As a seller never PayPal.

On the other hand it is important to note that there have been a number of very good people on this forum that have NOT scammed people.
I just remember a case with @rwxr in which I bought a pair of trucks from him. They took forever and we thought they got lost. He refunded me the money even though it was not his fault (plus I payed via friends and family) Once the trucks finally arrived I payed him again and everything was good. It is important to remember that not all people are bad. We should just mention the ones that are good more.

Unfortunately lately there has been issues. There are those of us that have dealt with each other in the past with Zero issues. But we've had an influx of new people and people repping for companies and many of the new and old members can't keep track of who's legit or not. 

As senior members here, of course you include @Maxid need to lay down how shit rolls around here to protect each other from these types of issues. It's not perfect, but it's a start of a certain standard that we expect if you are to be a member of the community and especially if you are person providing goods or services, regardless of it new crap or not.

We are the safe haven for people selling random esk8 crap. We need people to feel confident to come here and if need be, do business on the forum.

As @Maxid mentioned, it's a tough situation for sellers as well. I have to sell via friends and family because I ship from Canada and can't obtain tracking on my pulley kits (for an affordable price anyways).  So if someone filed a claim, they would definitely side with the buyer and I would be out of pocket for the funds, shipping costs and product.

I would say only buy from friends and family from TRUSTED forum members.

Just my 2 cents.

thanks @onepunchboard for the vouch.

@Michaelinvegas transactions over the internet has always had this issue, how to trust a total stranger to deliver on a promise.  sadly paypal seems to have a monopoly on trusted transactions but i suggest an escrow "service" for this board.

maybe we can pick a handful of people, volunteers of course, that will be the middle person for monies changing hand.  once both parties agree that a transaction is done, the funds can be released.  it's a f'kin hassle but a good way to mitigate the increasing fukery that's happening on here.

Paypal has seller protection. If you follow the requirments for seller protection you should be good. Things do go wrong sometimes but I would never use friends and family as a buyer because your screwed either way with using that option imo.

The biggest protection for sellers is tracking on shipping. If you show you have a tracking number and its on its way, paypal is more willing to side with you as a seller. And as always take pictures when you send and recieve things to prove the condition they are in.

To take it a step further..If a seller suggests friends and family don't buy from them.

Lots of us use paypal as sellers and don't have issues with people doing chargebacks. Biggest reason? We deliver exactly what we say we're selling. And if there ever is an issue, we take care of it quickly.

Maybe we should have some sort of rating system for buyers and sellers? 

Anyway all good ideas... the escrow can work, I've used that type of system paying for expensive services to people that you aren't sure of....of course there's an added fee, a separate website, various account crap involved doing that way....but maybe it's unavoidable....

We def need something simple and protects both parties as much as it can.somethng that makes sense. Anything overly complicated will just fail...and people will go right back to dealing like black market.

I think a system of rating the sellers will work. A system of rating buyers is difficult. You truly limit the size of the market that way. The only seller protection available is tracking + photos prior to embarkment + shipping insurance. 

With those (3) measures i think you are as good as protected. Also when you do the transaction send the buyer the photos of the packaged product and tracking number. It will deter miscreance on their part.

build in a workflow, have funds sent to internal "escrow" account, and have it only release once the package is confirmed received.

I have lost money paying with a check mailed via USPS, someone along the way got the envelope and "washed" the check and made out to some fake company and cashed, I lost $7,000 for a few days until the bank reversed it. Cash would be an issue as well. It's a percentage game, eventually someone's going to get jacked.

you guys all sound young as hell. eBay is older. PayPal was awesome for buyers...then eBay acquired PayPal. I used to sell stuff on eBay in college when fees were not bad. When PayPal went to eBay it sucked because eBay basically charges seller 3 times, Listing fee, Final Price %, and PayPal fees.

@GrecoMan you are lucky to be at whatever age you are when things got easier. Senior year in high school was when I got dial up internet. I was sitting at my college CS class when I learned about Google.

I would like to add that Paypal Business sometimes is not suitable for crowd funded projects:
when many people pay to one single account, paypal has the right to freeze the money received until all of those people confirm that they receive the product. 
And this mechanism kills the purpose of the group buy (which by definition is a method to raise money to pay a lot of stuff)
(Money needed to buy stuff)➡(people send money)➡(paypal freeze money until people receive stuff)➡(people cant receive stuff because organizer can't buy stuff)

I mean this workflow is already supported by PayPal currently isn't it?

You sell it, send the tracking number (via PayPal) and you are protected.  You insure it FULLY for the amount because you do not ever trust USPS -- btw $200 of insurance costs about $2.25 (even cheaper if you use shipstation or have discount shipping as a seller thru another service)

Buyer receives package -- you are good.
USPS loses package -- you are good (because you are insured).

I really don't understand the problem... are we talking about the grey areas?

* Package was received but buyer says it wasn't? USPS protects the seller and he doesn't need give refund or USPS re-imburses

* Damage to packages? You fully insured the package so USPS has to re-imburse

Please tell me what else can go wrong?

Nothing really outside of postal theft. I have literally dropped packages off at the post office. (three times) and they were never seen again. A couple of weeks ago it happened where tracking went dead after drop off. I let 8 days pass before I went in to file a claim. I ended up threatening them with violence! Thought I'd be arrested, but I wasn't, and the next day tracking updates appeared. Coincidence? Probably. But, whatever!

I effing HATE USPS when it comes to my neighborhood and the mail carrier who OFTEN delivers our mail to the wrong place. I have 2-3 missing packages per year a while back, now I only use my work address that doesn't seem to have issues.

Whenever I dispute with USPS on lost insured packages, they do their internal investigations for a few days and then tells me "the postal carrier said he delivered it" and there's really nothing else to that! I'm pretty sure that guy was stealing stuff

I mean sure USPS is horrible broken bureaucracy but you can also get a Fedex account with discounted shipping and insurance protection.  That company is more likely to return your money and demand signature.

Sure when USPS steals... the system breaks. But even in your case, if you use Paypal you can file a dispute with the seller (and even before doing so tell the seller) or work with seller because as the insurer he can return your funds and get his funds back from USPS. It's not a perfect system because you know government and all.  But if insured I think USPS can be safe.

All I am saying in response to this thread about `Friends and Family Paypal` is to NOT use that to send money but go thru the regular transaction process and work with safeguards and tell the seller to fully insure the package, etc.  If done so the whole... "I lost my ass doing ecommerce and getting ripped off" argument falls by the wayside. You make your own safeguards and let them protect the parties.  Seller ratings like on Ebay can help because inevitably the seller does many more transactions than a buyer and he needs to safeguard himself.

Reddit uses a system that relies on a buyer/seller confirmation thread.  One person says they bought/sold something to a tagged user.  The second person must post, "Confirmed" and then a bot awards them both a point.  

I have no idea how difficult it would be to implement something like this.  Just an idea that has been proven to be effective on a much larger site.  (This site has 6.7k registered users with 2.1k active this month.  Compare that to _r/hardwareswap_ with 65.7k subscribers)

On a custom order the buyer can refuse delivery and leave you hanging with 40 custom engraved heatsinks and paypal will decide in their favor.  All that milling time lost. Something to think about if you do custom or contracted work. The only protection you have is to decline future sales to that person or entity.

I do my best to take it in stride and chalk it up to a learning experience. The key is to not let things like that get you down as business owner or as a customer.

Here is my two cents on Paypal "friends and family" payments. If you use it and are neither you have already entered into a dishonest transaction by screwing the third party, i.e. PayPal. If you in turn get screwed it is merely a continuation of an event you already set in motion by breaking PayPal's terms.

Lol... What about heatsinks that you say your gonna start on x day 3 different times, and then 19 days pass and you still haven't started...  Then get mad at the customer and say your banned from ordering because you(chaka) failed your commitment timeline three times. 

That's a good reason to have PayPal protection. In case ya know a seller bullshits you. But hey at least you refund things when you know you haven't started anything in the timelines you provide.

Pure profiteer doesn’t exist in the DIY world. All the stuff we have is archaic for the most part. People have just apparently grown accustomed to shit service it seems. If people expect it why would the seller change their ways?!? Don’t blame them at all. If I had money in the game and this is the status quo why change?  

I’m generally the most patient person in the world and out of 3 people I’ve dealt with 2 out of 3 have had horrible customer service, and some have been absolutely awful. Like “I knowingly sold you a faulty product and even admitted to you that I knew it is a faulty product but I won’t just give you your refund back until I get nagged for 30 days” awful... lol

Until this gets bigger and we are working with companies instead of dealing with a guy in a garage (so to speak) the issue will persist. Unless of course you are dealing with the few people that have exceptional customer service.

Also worth noting:

DO NOT USE PAYPAL WITH FRIENDS AND FAMILY! 

Almost all accidental deaths occur within or very close to home.  That's because that's where your freinds and family are. They are the ones that hurt you the most. So why the hell would you give them money?

Just strictly deal with total strangers and do so as a business and you'll be fine.

Custom made goods are not protected under Paypal purchase protection with a couple of caveats - the merchant has to disclose this thoroughly upfront though and make sure they have evidence to support their case.

https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/paypal-safety-and-security

Generally, US contract law handles transactions of goods versus services differently -- for goods it's all about acceptable delivery before payment is due and in most states the rules are defined by something called the uniform commercial code, for services it's all about substantial completion of services (70% is a rough rule of thumb) before payment is due. Custom orders look more like services which is why the line is where it is - most credit cards have the same rule too. In really rough terms the rationale is that if a seller receives returned goods he can always resell the item but it's not like you can do the same for services. This is all slightly different by state but for the most part this is true nationally.

Damn, this is rough, I have sold working escs for less than they were worth and bought stuff through people on this site and there were never any scammers or bullshit that wasn't on my end or their end. 
I guess this is what happens when a forum gets big like this, it goes to shit. The ONLY problem I ever had selling an buying was USPS taking forever to ship. I have two transactions under my belt and hope to staylike that unless I know who Im buying from.  Fuck everyone who wastes someone elses time trying to scam a couple of 20s,

middle person for monies changing hand.  once both parties agree that a transaction is done, the funds can be released.  it's a f'kin hassle but a good way to mitigate the increasing fukery that's happening on here.

this can be done with software. no need for a  person to be the middle man.

I don't want to commit, but I might be able to help depending on my schedule at the time

I am guilty of that too, but I usually see the people I use F&F to make payments to in person at least 1 or 2 times a year.
