Hi
So part of the story is in @stewii thread about his great esc ESCape.
This should be a final version but as things come to life some changes might happen.
Right now I'm working on CAM to tell you the price asap.
Questions, opinions or criticism are welcome ;)![final dual RC2 g1|690x432](upload://um18p4QABPPKTbTcuHjWAmrEJrD.png)![final dual RC2 g2|690x432](upload://5QJzSwiio3f9HL12vT7fH0O0LJp.png)

As for FOCBOX. I can do a similar version for it. Should be easier than this one because plan is to put FOCBOX in it without and modifications to not void warranty. If you are interested just let me know.

**UPDATE!**
I have decide not to do Focbox enclosure as @Kug3lis is making great job at it ;)

looks awesome dude, a through enclosure heatsink :grin:
I'm tempted & I don't even need one,
but I do have a extra set of escapes coming my way,
and
I already have a set of Dark Matter motors I have no use for,
so... :rofl:

@Acido it suppose to go in main enclosure. You can use some water proof box make a cutout and use this flange to fix it with radiator outside.

@Cobber thank you. It would be perfect match for you :D

@Mobutusan you are the first one. Let's see if there's someone else.

Hey @Cobber   I have a use for those DM motors if you wanna sell?  Riding unsensored FOC and jumping into all my runs or starting on a downslope is driving me nuts! :rofl:  Only if you wanna of course...I'm gotta buy something similar soon anyways :crazy_face:

...on the topic @LukePL beautiful enclosure dude!

because of this design, you can simply use silicon and seal the outside and all wire ports. Should be easydoing :slight_smile:

As Im buying bboxes or escapes I wont need cooling since those can not get hot from what ive read
Will see what will come out better and cheaper but also good looking some cool box or this..

Are the dimensions for the alu piece final? I`m designing a simple enclosure for my trampa, where i want to use this nice dual housing for my Escapes .... So i need the dimensions for the cutout i need to make in the top plate :-)

```
as long as you use thermal paste or th. pads that are not electrically conductive it should work. 
Focbox heatsinks are all alu. and they use a big thick silicone pad. 
You only have to make sure that the fets don't touch the heatsink.

[/quote]
Thermal conductive silicone pads are the answer. There are also a lot of exposed parts like connector pins under the esc. Every electronics in aluminium enclosure has to be placed with a lot of thinking to avoid short circuit.

It was done on Brother Speedio R650x1. I don't know what it has to be honest. I designed the case and made Cam but I had an operator to help me with machining. The gcode file it's like ordinary .txt and he plugged a usb stick into machine and choose the file and fire works started :D

Is the can cable (for connecting 2 vescs) supposed to come out of the enclosure or will it be hidden inside?
Would be nice if the can cable has some routes to hide in :)

I would be interested in one for 2 FOCBOXES but with symetrical outputs for cables (reversing one FOCBOX and putting cooling fins on both up and down sides of the case). One more hole for sensor cable would be needed.

This is nice idea but.....Complicated and expensive and so far I see that there are two persons that need it for Focbox and I would need 10 to do it.

![dual measurments|447x500](upload://bmMscKRXvsEuUzMO4dpByC1BNYn.png)

Here are the measurements but PLEASE don't cut your enclosures yet!

The idea how to use it is similar to this.![enclosure instalation|552x500](upload://nLbGXMV6lTpp72pOcEVHAMWTz8o.jpg)

The difference is that it has this flange with threads so you can seal it and fix it quite easy. It might require a outside frame to act like a washer to push it evenly but I have to check that.
I have also in plan a 3D printed box for it with some options how to make it water resistant.

Thanks LukePL, I think this solution is really nice for e-skates for it won't work for e-mountainboard in all terrain usage. I have to put this on the upper side of the deck. I hope I'll meet some other "symetry guy" one day‚Ä¶ :sweat_smile:
