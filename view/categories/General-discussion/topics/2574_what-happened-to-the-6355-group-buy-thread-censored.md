7 hours ago someone posted details and prices of sensored 6355 motors, gauging interest for a group buy.
This guy claimed he had contacted the Enertion OEM.

This thread has since disappeared.

Censored by @onloop ?

Why ?

I deleted the thread because it was spam, this forum is not a place for random people to rock-up & create an account for the sole purpose of asking other forum members for money!...  If it is not monitored now, it will get out of hand I will eventually be forced to stop all posts regarding items for sale & group buys etc & we will end up like ES where legit members are not able to promote their art.
