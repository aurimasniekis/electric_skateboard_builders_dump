I keep having issues with shipping, I need some advice.  Maybe we can pool some info here and make it easier for everyone.  This is what it has cost me lately, am I doing something wrong?

$6.70 to ship a 2oz XT90 to Dual XT60 adaptor via USPS Priority Mail 3-Day in a small bubble mailer.
$19.30 to ship motors and trucks cia USPS Priority Mail 2-Day in a Medium Flat Rate Box.
$23.61 to ship a large set of trucks via UPS ground, as USPS was going to be almost $40.

I have a 0.5 oz BT module I need to mail, that cannot be mailed in an envelope apparently so I don't know what to do as I don't wanna spend 7 bucks to ship it.

HELP!!!!!  I am tired of getting abused by carriers!

Yep, its in a tiny 3d printed carrier so it can be screwed to the deck, but it literally weighs 1/2 oz and is 2x2x1/2 in.

I use USPS Click & Ship a lot, its easy and ok for boxed stuff, but its robbery for small things.

Also, I'm planning  a work trip to Oregon next month (maybe) and really wanna ship my hummie deck ahead of me, but when I shipped to Miami this summer it was 100 bucks each way.  That seems massive to me, maybe my perspective is skewed or something, but it seems like a lot.

First class can be used for any package less than 1lb, and it dosnt matter what packaging you use (bag, envelope, box). Or should only be $3 anywhere CONUS. 

For trucks, try disassembling them and using a flat rate bubble mailer ($7).

do you have an ebay account? you can get a discount on shipping rates by going through ebay to make your labels through USPS. I recently shipped a bunch of small USB Miner devices first class in padded envelopes... (actually, I'm a cheapass and I cut up  an old amazon padded envelope in to 10 little other packages. it was like $2.33 cents each to ship throughout the US and it had tracking. worth a shot.

UPS is worse. They make you sign up for an account. You prepay for shipping using boxes you ordered. (45 x 18 x 6) and then they bill $30 more later saying your box was 46 x 18 x 8 even though, the box is printed with the size. I've been fighting a $340 bill from them for that shit and will never ship ups again. Straight up mafia style Scammers.

I cheat. I make a new gmail account, then make a stamps.com trial.  When I am shipping regularly for month or so, cancel and repeat.

Shipping supplies from Walmart, your $6.70 package should be in the 3.50-4.50 range.

Carry on. I put it up in the overhead compartment. People just put their bags on top on the upside-down board. But on the way their the flight attendant closed the compartment where my board was, she was like, I don't wanna put anything on top of that, it looks expensive. Lol.
People at the security was like, is that motorized, is that electric?

$97 via fedex via 3-6 day Ground service from FL to NV, then $123 for 2-3 day ground via FedEx back to FL from NV. 

Crate was 14 x 16 x 47, and weighed 105 pounds. 

Shipping boards is ridiculous for most people, especially for events. That's why i'm trying to do that thing i mentioned on telegram with the event shipping service. I'm going to try it out for Colorado. 

I can ship a complete in a 35 pound package at 48" x 12" x 6" from FL to WA for less than $30 and it will be there in a week. I've never heard of anyone walking into a UPS, FedEx or USPS store and mailing their board anywhere at all for less than $100. This is (in my opinion) because 1) they never have the right box, and 2) they always tell them what it is and that always incurs unwanted attention and fees.

UPS are uber dicks with shipping the 45x18x6  is what box but when you open it and put stuff in it it usually expands slightly and then when they check it  if the box is slightly more that the dimensions stated they up charge it.  Plus they add in a fuel charge if it is a bigger size no matter the weight.  Or like FedEx does Dim what which is dimension weight that means at a certain dimension the box should weight this much.  The biggest scam is insurance because after 600 it is an added $1.30 for each hundred dollars more but from $500.01 to $600 is 9.15.

@maner in answer to your specific thread question, Just buy bubble mailers and declare the package as 1" to 2" thick by the existing width and height. So many focboxes shipped that way. You'll still get ok USPS rates provided you get an account with an aggregate and stop walking into the store. For USPS, try stamps.com. 

Motors and trucks and shit like that can be large and heavy, just make the dimensions as tight as possible on the packaging, its the best you can do for that stuff.

So, when I use stamps.com I preorder sticker labels by the half sheet size(2 per 8.5 x 11 sheet). I create all my labels and print to PDF, then use word and fit 4 labels on to a 8.5 x 11 sheet. Cut and peel them, can have a full size label on something as small as a CD case bubble mailers. Anyway, most post office you can walk in and just leave the packages, the smaller ones you can drop into the inside package drop. 

Basically I preprint all mine, and talk to no one at the post office - except the first time to find out where to leave prepaid packages. And basically walk in, give everyone funny looks as I cut through the line, put my package down in the spot, and walk out thinking, "these poor people never tried stamps.com, fuck that line." lol

I guess you don't live close by a post office..  mine is about 2 miles away.

I actually work less than a mile from one, but its essentially closed because of some asbestos thing.  They have a couple of window trucks out front but wont accept anything over a small priority box/envelope or over 9oz.  Anything else, I have one close to my house, but they are only open 4 days a week and only from 10-2.  

I have a Zebra label printer and a million labels.  Found it in the mortuary (where we put all the crap machines for storage), brought it back to my office and set the bastard up.  I usually do my thing online, then save the label as a PDF, dump it into photo shop and crop all the crap away, save as a PNG and print.  The whole process takes 2 mins. 

Even so, the only packages I have ever had lost were when I dropped them at the PO.  If I wait for a receipt or give it to the carrier, typically it all goes good.  I think they just throw the packages wherever.  I mean, when I ordered my spot welder, it was sent signature required (for some reason), they didnt feel like getting out of the truck so they just drove around with it for 4 days until I called about the tracking info showing it had been here for awhile.  I had to go in to sign for it.  The USPS thinks a lot of themselves :slight_smile:. 

My issue has been just the cost.  But with the discovery of online 1st class mail I'm in good shape now :).

I am trying to ship a 5 lb package to the UK, but cant use 1st class as its over 4 lbs.  Anyone have any suggestions?  UPS, FedEx & DHL are all over $170 and USPS is $70.

Have you looked into using Regional Rate Boxes for priority mail.
It's cheaper than Flat Rate Priority Mail.![IMG_8508|666x500](upload://nT2iv98WXyApVOhS8pkchocDaQt.jpeg)

You have to order the boxes online at usps website. 
They are free and shipped to you free of charge. 
Then when you create a priority mail ship label online, deselect flat rate and put in the actual weight of your package. 
Then the shipping options will include regional rates. 
There is a weight restriction of 15 lbs if my memory serves me. 
Shipping from CA to NY is about $10
Shipping within the state is less than a flat rate small box.
The regional rate A box is perfect size for most esk8 parts.

I shipped my old Meepo from SF to Georgia for $35 via FedEx. No idea why you are paying $100 each way.

Whi did you use and what size is it?  The reason mine was so pricey is because a 40 imch board in a box with no padding is still over the large package definition so incurrs a massive upcharge.

You can use FedEx Ground or FedEx Home Delivery. 
They mostly quote you by weight. I used a cardboard and just wrapped that around the board, even put some padding below the battery. Final size was 40x10x4 at 18lbs. 
You can calculate it here. https://www.fedex.com/ratefinder/mobilestandalone?method=destinationCountryChange

Try to reduce weight as much as possible, take off the trucks and carry those with you, just ship the board and batteries. It should not cost you more than $50 one way within US.
