Hey there, I‚Äôm looking for someone with a cnc and some aluminum that could do some brackets for me, to have more clearance on my wheels and a bigger wheelbase
Something like so :
![image|458x458](upload://5g6XSjHzfy9D6he771dKZ2R6uMk.png) 
But flat, so it will be easy to do !

I‚Äôm in Switzerland so if I can find a bloke from here, it would be awesome
Otherwise Europe in general is good :wink:

Cheers to all

Ask @Miniproto (Swiss) I think he is able to make it!

I'll do it sometime, but it won't be long, it's literally a rectangle with 8 holes on it, and a few filets

Yeah I could do a drop but kinda lazy...
I think I'm going with a big hole to be able to mount the trucks drop through

I have only 3 axes, so if you wish a angle on the plate it can be difficult. 
But i don't calculate industry prices. So where a CNC factory starts at 250chf with programming i could start at 50 chf.

Maybe the exile could be carefully bent straight? 

In a strong machine vice with heat

That would be cheaper than a custom cnc job

There seems to be the same spacing between each holes right ? so 2.5 inch all the time ?
How thick the plate is  ?

@Skunk‚Äôs plates are actually a hair thicker than the 0.25‚Äù shown on the design. I would recommend going as thick as possible when using a drop thru cutout

Very nice, thanks so much for providing the plans !
What's for the second plate on the bottom ? Looks like some MTB style baseplate ?

Also the Angle up and down..

If someone made brackets like this but without the pattern on the sides I would probably also be interested in a set.

Made a quick drawing..  its 230,88 x 85,73 mm and about 6 mm thick (instead of 6,35 mm)
i also dont know about the hole diameter. I can also make the plates red anodized or so.. but it costs.

Do you have anything thicker ? Like 7mm or 8mm ?
I'm afraid that 6mm could bend with time and vibrations

That would be great to have it made in 7mm, but I don't want to push you into buying a big sheet of 7mm just for that
But if you can that would be great !

Also, the design seems unnecessarily wide. A caliber baseplate is a little over 55mm wide and 80mm long, 15mm of overhang on each side would look a bit wonky. I don't think @Skunk‚Äôs plates would look weird because of the design on the sides but if you leave the sides straight I would reduce the overhang of the bracket to 5-10mm.

Yeah but given the leverage goingg on there, a little wide could be good
I really don't want to found myself to the hospital because I was going at 40 km/h when one of them snap

The bottom plate is a support for the opposite side of the deck to act as a clamp. It‚Äôs extra wide so you can mount it topside and still stand on it fairly comfortably

The hole diameter is drawn at 5mm but depending on which deck/trucks you are using it needs to be larger to accomodate for variations
```

And holes diameter is not that important, if it's a little tight, I have easy access to a column drill (is it the word ?)

@Miniproto hey, do you have an idea of pricing for a set of bracket in 7mm thick please ?

## \#39 Posted by: Miniproto Posted at: 2019-06-04T06:15:15.176Z Reads: 44

Depends if i manufacture 1 or 5 pcs. But the price would be about 60 chf on a single plate with the Material i have to purchase. 
Also the thickness of 7 mm is not standard 8 mm is.
At 3 pcs. Or more price would come down to 30-35 chf.
If you want cheaper you can bring or send me the Aluminium Material and i can do it for less.

Well if @Hexagon is still interested we may have 4 plate
How much pieces do you need to make the price go down a bit ?
120 chf is more expensive than I thought I must admit üòÖ

The problem is ordering Material. I know no shop in Switzerland which can send me for 30 sfr, 6 or 8 mm Aluminium.
In Germany is possible but then i must drive to Germany which costs fuel. So the cost is nearly the same. 
If you can send me aluminium i can do it for the Half the price. 
Btw i can also cut Carbon Fiber. Or make Motor Brackets. A previous work of me.. ![downhillstem|666x500](upload://iDLHj1K7mVeU5ShFfhNE1A5GXYI.jpeg)

Any progress on this? Or did the conversation end at @Miniproto not being able to source material? :frowning:

I need a pair of brackets as well, was wondering if maybe people are interested in a smaller bracket design that would reuse one of the existing screw holes in their board, something like this:
![bracket|296x338](upload://2uGKqjjZAvXMXKQ8lorq0LrmjEB.png) 

Or, still with drop-through support (requires cutting your deck a bit to make a hole there as well unless you have a Hummie like nose):

I didn't get a order, i can make plates cheaper now since i also do cnc work for other customers.
Which i can combine materials and cut costs.
