Has anyone been in contact with dave recently? Last month I requested a refund of my order (placed more than 10 weeks ago) and he replied that he’d refund me. I still haven’t received anything or even heard back even after trying to follow up... I feel like this constitutes as theft...

Let me vomit up the same answer from last year: 

"Contact him on Instagram"
