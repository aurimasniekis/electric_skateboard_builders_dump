These videos are referring to beta units. Ultimately we decided the silicone case was a better option for various reasons. When a company designs a product it goes through multiple test iterations, they change some things to improve the design. There's no conspiracy here :smile: I mean the youtube videos show the beta 1 units with the aluminum case.  

By the time we actually put the units up for presale it was made the clear the case would be silicone, sorry if you felt that was unclear but it says this in multiple places/videos. Including on the product page:

The video was made long before we allowed anyone to pre-order. Additionally it doesn't specify which portion of the casing will be aluminum, if you'd like to get all lawyer-y haha

Here's a video from 2 months ago showing the silicone case:

It is aluminium. It has a silicone cover.

Also why is it such a big issue? Are you holding your board by the back trucks and slamming it against a wall for 30-45 mins?

Am I missing what's funny? We run an 40 amp openloop test for 30 seconds or so and look at the delta T. This number is significantly larger if the heatsink is installed incorrectly and doesn't pass our test jig.

Exactly.  China factories are famous for sending high quality shit then once you are not worried they start cheaping-out on your ass and trying to fuck you.  Usually QC is the very first cost to be eliminated.

I'm glad you have automated tests so once they start trying that bullchit you will catch them immediately.

Hence, what I meant:

the tests are actually done twice, once at PCBA level, and once the unit is fully built. at pcba level we're looking to catch a missing fet, once the unit is assembled we're looking to catch a bad heatsink install.

Try imagining me posting to forums multiple  times 
saying  the  things you created are hideous colors. Try imagining me emailing you a set of instructions on how to paint a board, when you already know perfectly well how to. Then I hop on a forum with all your customers saying I emailed you instructions on how to paint the board (during the Christmas holiday) and you still haven't done it. I tell them all you must be neglecting your duties and are doing a shit job. This is how you treated me thus far.  Don't be surprised when I don't like you :slight_smile:

Here's a few things you've said about the stuff we've worked so hard to create:

[quote="briman05, post:748, topic:64944"]
can you explain the reason behind the bright ass hunter orange and not the black like the beta test it just looks like a child picked the color with everything else black or it should have come out around halloween throw a mouth on there and it is like a jack o lantern.

Ok I didnâ€™t email you and you had said you were trying to find a coat effective way and I have used the software in the past to run old software. And that was actually something I tried before I even sent you the pm to make sure it wasnâ€™t hard and did that out of kindness all you had to say was thanks in the pm and that was it. And I had said in several of my posts that I understand that you were busy handling the firmware issues. The one about the dead one was just me stating that there was the first dead unity I didnâ€™t say it was faulty from the factory. Not once did I say you were doing a shit job so donâ€™t even say I did.

The fact that you guys didnâ€™t make sure that there was a Mac user amongst the beta testers is not covering the whole community or atleast make sure there was a tool for the unity because if I bought a unity in the first batch and then found out I would be pissed because it would be something I spent a good amount of money on and couldnâ€™t even use it. Iâ€™m not saying there has to be an app but atleast a Mac tool like enertion has for the focbox. 

If you want to say my boards are hideous that is fine I can take the criticism and not getting pissy because I have had hundreds of people say they were beautiful but multiple people have stated they didnâ€™t like the orange and felt it should have stayed the black like the betas so it was just me.

I can take the criticism too, it's just a bit tiring. Is there some reason you want to antagonize us? Can't we just put this BS behind us and treat each other with respect? I dont need you to hold back your criticism I just ask that, as a fellow creator, you treat my creations with a bit more respect. I can identify you aren't always disrespectful but I believe you can see times when you've said things in the tone you do you you might not say were we sitting face to face. I just want you to realize there's a passionate group of imperfect people behind them. We make mistakes but it doesn't mean we deserve the rudeness.

Windows is free, if you have 100GB free, can't you just use boot camp to load windows on a Mac? 

If I was setting up a unity for the first time and knew a little bit of anything about computers, I'd almost consider it easier to load windows if there wasn't a Mac version of the tool. Am I missing something though, I thought they released a Mac tool...

I can put it behind us and I understand people are not perfect and I have never been a person to hold back how I really feel about something. Iâ€™m not the type of person to sugarcoat something because growing up my family never sugarcoated nor sheltered me from the world. 

I apologize for some of the stuff I had said and if you took stuff a certain way like the pm I sent you which was done out of kindness because I knew it could be done.  One thing that I will say that irritates the hell out of me is the face that there has been qc stickers on products that have obvious visual issues. And I know it is different and difficult to do with 500 as opposed to the 1-5 that I do. I double check everything I do and am extremely hard on the designs I do. 

You can ask my wife I have taken stuff that I worked on for hours and and tossed it in the trash because it didnâ€™t come out how I envisioned I actually just did it yesterday

@briman05
When any company produces around 1000 pieces of the item then sell them with the QC check 
It's likely that any of the items must get missed or something because of the involvement of multiple factors 
Multiple people and multiple experiences are there

I do understand that you are kind of perfection seeker but there is always liberty available.

The main thing is if any of the items have defects, it has been taken care within the first place or not
That single unit contains a very little defect which (luckily) customer resolved, otherwise we will be taking care of that in first place on priority. That's what counts.

Performance wise, none of the product showed any malfunctions or defects. (Excluding user errors)

My point is there is a major success rate with Unity and we are willing to maintain and improve it in future :slight_smile:

We will never stop improving our items because spaces are always available for improvements

This right here is what really counts.

We want 75V ESC.  We don't need 300A.  Just the 75V part.  And standalone units would be better than all-in-one stuff, especially if they can be daisy-chained or come as a pair or quad that can be broken apart.

Please and thank you.
