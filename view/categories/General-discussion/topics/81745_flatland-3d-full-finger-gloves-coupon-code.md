Flatland 3D has offered us a discount code for 10% off their new esk8 gloves: **SHARETHEROAD**
This code works with their other products as well.

For those who doesn't know about these gloves, they implemented KNOX slide pads into the palm to help protect your wrist in the event of a fall, for the full finger gloves, they added a wrist guard of sorts which prevents your wrist from bending backward. Personally this is very welcomed as I always wear a wrist guard that make holding remotes very awkward.

This is better then regular gloves, or God forbid no gloves at all, but I'll stick with my slide gloves with pucks sized and fitted for a remote. That way if my vescs happen to go out bombing lookout mountain some day I'll be able to finish the run as if I were riding analog. 

How do people fall on hands without slide gloves? Does it hurt?

Damn. At least mine wasn't something that would make the gloves unusable. They definitely seem to have had some QC issues with this batch.

yeah, add in that crescent moon shape puck and it's golden.

I like their idea of a wrist protection in these but realize that hard plastic spine is what make these gloves hard to put on and take off. Once I get them on, the large fit me perfectly as their sizing chart indicated. but it's a bit of a struggle getting my knuckles when that hard plastic is there. I did take it out and it was an much easier process.

They haven't gotten back to me about the replacement, I might just take out the sewing kit and fix it myself so I can use it this weekend. (noticed it's on both gloves, definitely a weak point in their production)

It's a real shame as these gloves are so expensive - I don't think they are good value for money

I just reposition the puck on my TSG slide gloves.
Those BTR gloves look really sweet.

Honestly, I grabbed Knox Orsa's ages ago..a bit expensive but really well made. Seems a lot better quality than these Flatland ones.

Half of my plastic slider gone and a hole after one fall. I mean its better than my skin but I was really hoping these could take a few slides. :frowning:

I mostly go for slow cruises so this would be an overkill. But might be something you guys should use. Looks like it would work

Just cut the puck of a slide glove in half.
Takes 30sec with a hacksaw and another 30sec with the file.

Yep it hurts. If I do fall I try to tuck my hands and arms into more of a roll position because you fall on your hands with you hands out front you are most likely going to break your wrist.
