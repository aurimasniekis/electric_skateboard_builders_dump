There's velcro, that's a plus.

Overall i think the build is good, just some extra measures needed to be made to secure the guts in the enclosure, as well as covering up the phase wire connectors to prevent shorting etc. 

I believe he is on the forum. So if you see this, take in my lil advice and do even better in the next build!

There is velcro. Me myself would have put some more... on all my builds my battery is also attached with velcro. never been any issue.
And drilling thru the deck, whats wrong with  that?
Its preference, some use inserts and some use this method. 

Loctite is missing but i think he will find out that its useful for this application. :wink:

I have seen worse... a lot worse :smile:

No, but he keeps asking and is also Hispanic so it's all good.

He's fine, sprained ankle on FB BAESK8.  This was literally crash weekend, I have 5 friends (five) who fell here and in Dallas, so weird 

thanks for asking

at 3:19 he is beating on the end of the motor shaft with a hammer to get the pulley on. I believe this may screw the bearings?

```
the main flaw is failure to use loctite

by drilling through the deck and placing the bolts on the bottom of the enclosure, we all know what will happen after vibration takes over - bolts shake loose.

I have bought two boards right here from forum members who followed no-loctite builds and injured themselves within their first few days of esk8

one, a TB enclosure came loose (guy used two Velcro strips on a 12S4P TB battery, and it fell and broke the TB enclosure) and the other lost a motor 

this is public knowledge from the sellers' own posts, here (I would never disclose otherwise).

I rode my board more than one year without any Loctite and nothing ever moves, nothing ! But this way, you have to check very often if everything is still in place.

Lucky you!
Others didn‚Äôt have had so much luck.
A broken helmet and to wake up in the emergency is not worth to save on loctite.

Never said it was a good thing, just trying to say that if you do not use Loctite, you have to check very often all scews of the board.

There's literally nothing wrong with using through bolts like he did, and he used lock nuts.

Haha.  I never locktite my motor bolts.   Never had an issue.    My mistake this time was after doing many fit tests trying to align motor mounts I forgot to torque down motor bolts (one side).   They were snug enough that I rode some 7 miles before last bolt broke loose.  Of course it happened while going uphill with a decent amount of throttle/torque being applied during my climb got me some 35mph wobbles n down I went.   The whole time I didn‚Äôt even apply brakes trying to ride it out but no luck üòÇ![image|375x500](upload://dlL2ZjNVzz8I2JL3UtMQFiuEqjn.jpeg) ![image|374x500](upload://iS3Z2mw79OpM70va4QBoJBYhc3R.jpeg)
