Since it would appear I have more chance of winning the lottery than getting my board fixed under warranty by enertion , does anybody have any suggestions as to what parts are worth and safe to use in a rebuild and is there anyone in Sydney or Australia that does that kind of work ?

I would suggest a deck swap and swap drive train. All the electronics are pretty reliable.
