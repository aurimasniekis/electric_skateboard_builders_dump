Thats what I used to do on my motorcycle during spring. All the pollen would jam up the filter quick.

to me they wouldnt really serve a purpose because most motors are sealed now so they wouldnt need those cans.

imo, looks kinda dangerous. The metal looks thin, and all I can see happening is a big enough rock hits it, and bends the metal cage just enough to make contact with the spinning motor and your far worse than not using anything to protect it in the first place.

Though that's just my two cents, never tried it so I can't say from experience. Just looking at the engineering principles and thinking about what could go wrong.

At the end of the day, wouldn't they preserve the life of your motors (unsealed)(aps)? Stopping small stones/debris and anything else that could creep inside and mess up the magnets, windings or sensors circuit board... ðŸ¤” And generally keep them from looking like this...

The covers so slim, once hit by a bigger stone or impact the cover would deform and be useless.
Plus the cover is made for specific motors. 
I doubt that they would fit a sk3 for example.
They way much longer than other 74mm motors.
