Now that I have a solid team helping me build I have been thinking of listing the integrated decks with only the battery pack.  Pricing would be tiered and begin with the deck and battery pack, complete with all the accouterments inside the flip hatch. Price will go up with the addition of VESC's or customizations such as special wood veneer or finish color.

The deck is set up for dual diagonal drive systems but I am sure a creative builder could figure out how to feed all the phase wires under the rear truck mount! ;)

 Only v4.12 or V1.1 Ollin ESC with direct FETs will fit due to the narrow cavity provided within the deck.

Our main focus will always be the completes we build but I know a few builders would like to use our decks with an existing drive they already have. Chime in if you think you would buy one, if enough people are interested we will get moving on this and make it available.

Ballpark cost for deck, bms, and vesc's for dual diagonal?

Honestly I feel like I should just get a complete at that point though.

If you subtract the cost of wheels, motors and motor mounts from the price of the complete it will give you a good ballpark estimate on what that would cost.  although I agree, you should buy a complete! :grin:

@chaka theres a lot of demand, I'm working with some board manufacturers right now to get hollow core decks out into the masses. I know you'll be a big pusher also. But I wonder how many you can push out. This is my problem with making them myself, which is why I'm looking to board manufacturers for some help :) Also, that brings into price. I'm still waiting to get quotes on the cost of some hollow core decks, but I expect to be able to sell them for around $150-$200 tops. With the hand craft work, I expect your decks will be in the $300-$400 price range.

We can build 2 a day with our current equipment but that will change when we build a few more hydraulic presses. Nothing like being able to build your own equipment to speed up vertical integration. Good luck on your project! When you have something to look at be sure to start a thread!

Damn, that's actually pretty good. 14 a week is not bad. But it is time consuming though. I came up to the math of it takes me around 8 hours per deck between the time spent gluing, sanding, and finishing (not including the time in the press). So at 8 hours of labor per board, that's $160 in labor minimum. Maybe your process is quicker, especially with the cnc machine doing the cutting.

When I did market research in the past, it seemed like most would pay $150 for it, many dropped out at $200, and very few would pay $250 or more. Being a chaka product, you know quality will be there, but you also pay for it. Still curious what the retail price will be for your decks.

The decks would be sold as a complete battery pack with cell level fusing. Seems most people would want the VESC's included too. It will be interesting to see how many people want just a hollow deck with a lid. My guess is not too many?

what the hell? 8 hours? are you stopping to roll joints? because you should have done that the night before. 

Not counting custom paint with fucking die cut vinyl stencils or tape and razor one offs and my in-deck wiring via machined channels filled with resin:

15 minutes gluing, overnight in the press, 30 minutes on the xcarve doing shape cutout and truck bolt holes all at once, 30 minutes sanding the edges smooth, 30 minutes to stain, 20 minutes to poly, 30 minutes to grip with mob and get it perfect or an hour to grip with coke bottle glass and over night to dry...

yeah it takes a couple days in curing time but only 3 hours max working time to pop out a usable deck unless you are literally doing everything by hand. If you are doing everything by hand, you need more robots. China will use robots. You can get your own and give China the finger because bad-assery requires it.

oh and with the wire channels resined in and sanded smooth: add about 2 hours of labor and 24 hours curing before sanding.

keep in mind robots can work while you roll your joints. That might be where you're getting hung up.

I'm going to just straight up buy a free ride one of these days when i have the extra cash. Not a lot of extra cash at the moment, all tied up building a factory in my garage. But i want one. 

I want one from all the great builders. My collection demands an Ollin Freeride, the Carvon Evo, i want a Raptor 2 also for shits and grins, i want a redember/psychotiller build too.  And i want one from @whitepony.  

And I want that Jeff guy  to hand assemble an Evolve BGTX for me but i want him to do it at 3am while he's tired and frustrated and cursing my name and whining about hazardous 18650 packs, and i want him to have a cramp in his leg because that's really annoying. All of that would make that evolve sweeter.

Just a thought/question, would it be possible to change it to dual rear ? (could allways run long wires but not a fan). 

I would  de intrested as hell though. (mayby in a group buy for europe guys to nnot get fuqed over by shipping) you can dream right ? :)

Could you ship in EU ? Please tell us an estimated cost when you can !

Here's a breakdown, though I might have missed something here:

a complete freeride is 2350.00 USD
the dual motor mount, with pulleys, ronin trucks, idlers is 439.95 USD
2x belts is 12.95 USD
2x v1.1 escs is 440.00 USD
2x 6085 motors is 279.90 USD
popoca wheels is 69.95 USD
remote is probably around 66 or so USD

so doing the math...the deck with the default 650wH 18650 battery pack might cost around...1041.25 USD

Damn. Price is justified by the labour costs.  Still I couldn't afford to spend 500.- on a deck. Of course there are all the finishes etc. But it clearly shows that this has to become somewhat popular that we can get prices down.

But stunning work once again, keep riding amd building man. One day when I finished studing or sold a liver I may afford your stuff ;)

The board is made up of a combination of materials, birch, maple, finish hardwood and fiber composite 12 plys in total. The stack up measures 25mm and provides the necessary depth for components.

@michichopf Used to feel the same way when I was younger but the things I like just keep going up in price! If you figure a decent hollow core deck is in the $250 to $600 range our price is probably too low when you add the extra details and aluminum components.

LOL the list is growing. I think a lot of people don't realize how tight knit our community is and that we share blacklists as a courtesy to our brother vendors and builders. 

There are a few people on that list now. 

As builders, we should all strive for stellar customer service. Shit breaks, we fix it. No griefing, always a pleasure. As customers, we should be attentive and considerate. Know what you're getting, know who your getting it from, and know that you actually need it, or are at least committed to it. Ask plenty of questions before the purchase. I don't mind. I would rather you have the right part than suffer at the hands of me not refunding you for buyers remorse or not doing your reasearch.  Its not just our responsibility as business owners to somehow fabricate out of thin air a pleasurable experience. IT takes both parties actively participating in the pleasantries and being considerate. If you're a wishy washy whiny pants, I'm going to take your money and tell you where to go with your new part. 

There are people out there who are not attentive and not considerate. I won't serve those people. I refuse to do business with impatient narcicistic egomaniacs. I will not cater to a person's indecisive meandering when it costs me money. In the past i have gone waaaaaaayyyyyy over the line to help people. I refunded a guy and re-sold his board once because his mom threatened to kick him out if he didn't get rid of it. That was a $2400 build. I should have told him to suck it up. ITs not my problem he didn't comply with the local matriarch's tyranny. But i understood it and the guy was earnest. But then there's the guy who just changed his mind about some part he ordered a-la-cart because better deal elsewhere... No. 

So far I have had very, very few of these impatient, indecisive, and terrible people. 99% of my customers are great and are a pleasure to serve.

I wasn't going to reply to this but since you specifically mentioned me I want to make a few corrections here because I am a part of the online esk8 community.  Also because I feel everyone should just be aware of your personality.

I'm not a "career redditor".  Esk8 is my hobby and in my free time I go on reddit or here to stay updated, and to help out new comers to esk8.  

I first contacted you looking for a high performance board, you were extremely polite and professional and that was the reason I trusted you with $2000.  But all that changed after you passed the promised deadline multiple times and made up lies. 

I did not ever "slander" you.  Rather I just mentioned the facts and what transpired.  In fact I make it a point to always state that this is my personal experience and may not reflect your experience with ollin.  Here is the post I did on reddit regarding my experience with buying your freeride.

And here is the most recent thread on reddit about your integrated deck

https://www.reddit.com/r/ElectricSkateboarding/comments/7egm8y/to_all_the_builders_and_fan_of_ollin_integrated/

I'll let others be the judge about whether I was being negative or not.  Also it is pretty clear that it is not me, but rather you who didn't take it so well.  I shared my story in the most professional and polite way possible.  You were childish and blocked me from your instagram, which is something I'd expect out of a high schooler or a middle schooler...but not a grown up adult conducting business.  Note that I never did anything with his instagram, maybe liked a few of his pics and that's it.  So I don't see what blocking me would do?  Not that I care if I'm blocked from ollinboard's instagram, just something I thought was odd.

I have bought (and sold) boards from Enertion, longhairedboy, boosted, Evolve, Metroboard, Yuneec, and others I may be forgetting.  Never did I have any issues with any company or individual, except with you.  And really the problem wasn't even the months and months of delays...the main issue was that you just weren't an honest person and continued to lie about what was really happening.  For many many months you continuously told me the board is in the final stages and will be ready in 2 weeks, which was all a lie.  So you might be a great builder and have a high end complete board.  However the fact remains that you are an eccentric individual.  It's not your boards or motor controllers that are the issue, it's your irascibility and childish behavior.  This is why I would ask my friends to avoid you.  

I understand that you provide excellent service to some people like @guyguy who has your board.  You've replaced many things for him and have helped him ensure his board is up and running.  I applaud that and you have him convinced that your service is excellent based on his experience.  But it is clear that there is no consistency, if someone questions you then you immediately get upset and they are "blacklisted" as you yourself said.  

Please learn to be honest, and control your emotions a bit better.

To those looking to buy his integrated deck, it looks sweet and I would buy one myself.  But not from chaka.  It's your hard earned money, so only spend it IF you fully trust chaka as a person.  You may be one of the customers that he treats very well.  I know I personally wouldn't buy one, and I'm pretty sure I wouldn't be allowed to buy one anyway.

If anyone has any specific questions they can PM me.  I also have extremely negative messages his other pre-order customers have sent me but asked me not to share publicly because they are afraid that he will blacklist them as well (they just want to get their stuff they paid for at this point)

Chaka I hope you improve your business ethics and are more honest/transparent.  Your deck, mounts, and the new 90mm wheels look sick. I wish you best of luck in your sales, you are a talented builder and can be very successful.

a huge part of what we do, is building trust. Once built, biggest challenge is to maintain it. That's why we are all passionate and proud of what we achieve as one men armies!

Sometimes, we fail. Who does not? It's not easy to be perfect to everyone in todays societies where you expect something quickly, cheap with top notch quality. It may be a problem, but we take it as a lessons learnt and come back stronger.

My experience with Ollin has always been good and I trust him.

As far as blacklisting goes, I don't think that's a bad policy; especially for artisan builders like LHB or Ollin which rely on word of mouth. It's like U.S.'s policy against negotiating with terrorists - in any business you can quickly spend 80% of your time on the your worst customers which represent only a fraction of your business if you let yourself be held hostage by the fear of retaliation. We've even seen onloop go as far as telling customers [not to buy the Raptor2](https://www.reddit.com/r/ElectricSkateboarding/comments/6vo1xx/warning_from_ceo_dont_buy_a_raptor_2/). Why? Because at the end of the day it's just more damaging to the valuable customers to service value destroying customers. This is a sound business principle - you can read more [here] (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/278305156_Selective_demarketing_A_value_destruction_approach) or just google "selective demarketing". 

Like you said, this is a hobby to you. To these builders this is their business and livelihood. The stakes are very different for you to go online and say whatever you want. If you go online and call Ollin a liar people will remember Ollin being characterized as a liar, however, they won't remember you or validate your version events. The worst consequence you may suffer is your online reputation for your hobby is diminished. If Ollin tries to defend himself or calls you a liar in response he'll be seen as mistreating a customer or worse. That's the consequence of putting your neck out and trying to build something -- you are judged. The critic's life is an easy one, the doer's is not. 

On being sore about this topic; for months since your order was refunded after you sold your spot in line you've posted about it directly and indirectly. I'm not going to do an exhaustive dig but here's an example of a topic you've conveniently omitted: 
https://www.reddit.com/r/ElectricSkateboards/comments/76amk3/diy_companies_lhbollincarvonetc_vs_the_big/

The only time I've ever seen Chaka post about you was this most recent comment, and the wink at the end of the comment was there to indicate jest. You've taken it very sorely. If we want to talk about soreness one can simply just review your comments and his. 

I think I've always been pretty fair to you and others on this forum so keep that in mind when I say this: I think your post is childish. Luckily for me I don't have any skin in the game so I can say that... after all, the critic's life, it's an easy one.

I personally, have waited, and waited, and had him tell me something is being shipped today, and it isn't for another week.

But let me tell as someone whose now gone a bit into his shoes as a seller that it's tough. He does care about his customers, I've seen that personally. But when 30 people are trying to get you to send their stuff at once, a few are bound to get left dry for some period of time. It's really hard to be in his shoes, and I still can't imagine what it feels like for him with the high demand he is always in. He will fix things if they break, unlike most sellers. I had the feeling he's got my back as a customer and would buy more from him in a heart beat.

But this is my experience. My experience was very different with enertion and diyelectric, and not in a good way.

I agree with you, critic's life is an easy one.  And sure blacklisting will help his business maybe.  But at the same time, I just want others to know my specific experience because I wouldn't want the same thing to happen to someone else.  So that's the only reason I even posted about my experience.  Obviously it doesn't mean that it will happen to all his customers, you're an example of a customer who had an excellent experience.  If you didn't get your board after waiting all the time you did, perhaps you would have also had a different opinion.

With regards to the post you linked, that's also to inform others about the fact that builders cannot compete with large companies when it comes to speed and accuracy of shipping times (understandably so as they are one man operations).  That's it.  It wasn't a knock on anyone (as I mentioned in the post).  

If you think my post is childish, I understand.  I don't want to hurt anyone's livelihood or business, but I do hope it will make vendors like chaka more transparent and honest.  It's not that hard to say "hey I have ___ going on thus your board won't be ready", rather than saying "your board is almost done" for months straight.  Honesty should be expected out of everyone, whether it's a big company or a small vendor.  I am not the only one who thinks this.  Pikovsg on reddit also had a similar experience.  Two more Freeride customers messaged me personally and shared their negative experience, but they were too worried that if they would publicly post ollin would blacklist them.  It's the same complain basically, that ollin blatantly lies about what's actually ready and how far along they are.  

Keep in mind I had bought from enertion and had a board built by LHB, had great experiences with both and I happily shared those positive experiences.  I share all my experiences, positive and negative... in this case looks like I got blacklisted for sharing the facts.  

I will say Ollin was very prompt in providing a refund after he didn't want to sell the board to me, so that was much appreciated.  Many users have had great experiences with ollin, and I hope all his future customers will too.  But it doesn't change the fact that he has been dishonest in the past with regards to the real progress of his freeride board with most of his pre-order customers.

Lol @longhairedboy that's not what @Wallgreeens had to say but I am not part of photorph's private msg group so who knows? Im just glad he backs you up when photo throws you under the bus on reddit.

@Photorph you seem to be decent guy but you don't seem to understand that you are in fact slandering my company and others on a nearly weekly basis. I think at one point you even stated that we cost you 14k in financial losses!? The truth is you find smaller companies to be easy targets. At no time have I ever lied to you and I always gave you the best assesment possible when you demanded an update. There is no doubt that you feel scorned. You are entitled to that. Just know that your campaign against OllinBoardCo has only helped to broaden our audience.

You should see what happens every time somebody on the evolve forums starts questioning 18650 packs.

I've had 2 mod orders within thew last 24 hours and one a couple days before that, all because somebody mentioned "saftey" and "18650s" and "fire" on facebook. 

hahahahahaha i love evolve. And i love not having to pay to advertise.

I actually happen to like @longhairedboy a lot.  I had a great time with his board, and sold it to try other boards.  He was honest and upfront about everything, and he did help me out whenever needed.  I never throw LHB under the bus, this is you lying again trying to create drama.  In fact I always say positive things about LHB.  I make posts about diy builds vs big companies and the pros/cons of each, I may say I had the very first board from LHB which has a few issues that he addressed quickly.  I asked others how they like their LHB board and how their experience was.  I mentioned how he improved his enclosures after my board.  I may discuss the issues I had with my board and how they were resolved.  That’s not throwing anyone under the bus.  If anything, I recommend LHB if people are looking for a high performance board.  LHB has been a straight up and drama free person to me at least.  With you it’s different, I don’t say anything negative about your product.  Just exactly what happened and how you were.  

@Wallgreeens only said to you that I’m picky about my boards because I’ve owned a few.  I never met walgreeens, I just sold him my board and had a smooth transaction.  He seems like a good dude.  I don’t know what else he could possibly say about me, so again this is you trying to create drama.  

And for the record, at this point I did lose a bit more than 14k lol.  You see I started buying bitcoin and investing in pharmaceutical stocks in summer 2016.  That $2000 you held on to was taken out of my bitcoin account, and transferred to my bank to buy the board with the expectation that I’d have a board and get joy out of that $2000.  But instead I just had someone hold onto my $2000 until summer 2017.  If knew you would have just held onto my money for no reason and ended up with no board and a refund, I would have left it in bitcoin and that money’s value would now be way more than 14k.  

There’s more to all this, I’m not sure why Melissa told me all those things that weren’t true.  In November 2016 she said my board is just waiting on some grub screws... 3 months later, my board was still “almost” ready.  It was just comical at some point lol.  I can keep going, I can paste all the email correspondance with dates and what was said.  But anyway I don’t want to hijack this thread.  And I want people to buy your decks and for builders like yourself to succeed.  Just be honest with customers.  Maybe if things change in the future I’ll be riding one of your boards rather than evolves and boosted. 

Mods you can delete my posts or seperate them if you want.  I don’t wish any negativity towards Chaka.  Just trying to keep him in line :slight_smile:

Did your boosted board cost you $10,000 because you could have invested the $1,500 in bitcoin but instead you bought a boosted board? How much is your onewheel cost you? $20,000? The way you describe it, you've made a series of the most wrong economic decisions ever. After this post I'm going to go to the 7-11 and pay $500 for a gallon of milk -- after all, I could put that 2$ into bitcoin and a few years it'll be worth that much. 

I don't have issues with you sharing your opinion, I have an opinion with what you've become. You once were the guy that did e-board reviews which I thought was valuable but that's not you anymore. For the past six months you've become the go to guy when someone wants to post something negative about Ollin -- nearly every negative comment has you tagged. It's thinly veiled trolling. Your formula is to compliment your Ollin, mix in some facts, make some concessions so on the surface it looks like your balanced and then frame yourself as the innocent victim while your overarching message is negative one. Once you remove the window dressing it's easy to see your goal ends up being the same as a troll's: propagating negativity. For example, saying your critique is an effort to make vendors better... How do you do that by resurrecting an event that occurred 6 months ago and not having interacted with the vendors have made since? Your intent isn't to make vendor's better, it's to create toxicity. This is just like your $14,000 loss comment - BS after you peel back 1 layer. Most people don't think it through so it's more effective than the average trolling, that's for sure.

I'm not a fan of @Photorph.  He reminds me a crotchety old man, or a cop trying to abuse what little authority he has.  Everyone in the world knows your opinion of The Ollinboard Co, there is no need to continue ranting about it.  I don't believe what exact words I used when speaking with @chaka, but it was something like you are a whiny baby, who will never find a board that he likes, because all he wants to do is insult other peoples shit.  The @longhairedboy build is my favorite build to this day and you insult it all the time.  You should have tweaked it to your liking.  Not just dealt with those strong brakes or whatever complaints you had with it.  You are buying a pre built DIY board, the best part about it is tweaking the board to exactly how you like it.  That's one of the main reasons I sold my evolve.  I couldn't modify anything but the paint. Now stop saying my name, I don't like you @photorph.  


On a side note, I think selling deck/battery combo would be awesome. It's a killer setup. I do not really like hub motors as of now, but someday it would be awesome to have some on that deck.

I am going to go have some of that five thousand dollar milk now.

The difference is, I got those delivered and got what I paid for.  That didn't happen with the ollin because he just cancelled it.  Regardless, I respect you and I think you're a good person.  I was even going to see if we could meet up if I'm ever in chicago and go for a ride.  So I'm sorry if I said anything wrong that offended you.  

It seems pretty clear I shouldn't discuss this whole thing at all .  Looks like I'm getting hammered by you and wallgreens (who was very friendly to me while he bought my board).  But now it seems like everyone has changed their opinion of me because of my posts about my ollin experience.  

So I'll concede.  I've asked the mods before to remove my posts if they want.  To those who messaged me and agreed with me, thanks.

You haven't offended me, and it's not like I think you are a bad person either, I just find some of the things you say impossible to swallow. Also I think I was just getting annoyed with you supporting genuine trolls on the subreddit, it's like they type /u/photorph and you pop in and lend them your credibility, I'm like, really? I think it's all the more frustrating to me because I've always had a high opinion of you.  

I think if you're in Chicago we should definitely ride together. I promise I'm more congenial in real life than I am online. Look, we're in a small community, and despite our disagreements I'm sure if anyone on this forum met in real life they would have way more in common and way more to break bread about than not -- that goes even for the larger contentions we see on this forum and that goes for you and me too. There's a taco/pizza joint near where I live that's right next to a crossfit gym and there are few things better than talking e-sk8 while eating an el pastor and watching people sweat and flip tires on a sidewalk.

I don't think you should your posts should be removed.

You would need to split the pack to fit a tb battery. This deck really needs a custom pack so keep that in mind if you are thinking of buying a bare deck. With 1/4 inch risers you can fit 97mm wheels. 107 get a little wheel bite.

Just a side note, ALL of my boards come back to see me. It's part of the process of getting what you want. Oh your brakes are too stiff and something feels weird? send it back we'll discuss and adjust. Too much throttle response on the low end? lets tweak that. We keep doing that until its what you want. That's how i work. I don't just offer a warranty. Shit most of the time i'm preventing the need for it by simply looking at EVERYthing again any time you want a setting adjusted or a different pulley ratio. 

It's a totally different model than mass manufacturing and i'm the only one doing it, so it makes sense that its would be confusing to some degree. 

I have a guy whose probably getting both his deck and box replaced because i miscalculated the the required thickness of the deck for a heavy dude at high speed. We fix it. Period. 

@wallgreens gets all this and from a second hand board. Why? because its about the board and what it provides the rider, not about who had it first and how i can wiggle out of owning my shit. 

The boards are haunted by me. Has nothing to do with who owns my board. They're all mine. MINE.

For instance in France aside from UNIK there’s almost only Evolve on the market. 90 % of the riders i came across were riding shitty evolves. I always tell them nicely how they made the wrong choice. 
The rest is Boosted, DIY, meepo and very few Acton. 

All of them in the group ride have some kind of problem at some point with their evolves. Okp done some serious work on a few of those. 

I just can’t stand this company. The  « boss » of Evolve france set up group rides every Tuesday. There’s always a DIY guy there to smash them and show them that what they paid 2000 € ( 2380 $ ! ) is lame.

. 

As builders, we should all strive for stellar customer service. Shit breaks, we fix it. No griefing, always a pleasure. As customers, we should be attentive and considerate. Know what you're getting, know who your getting it from, and know that you actually need it, or are at least committed to it. Ask plenty of questions before the purchase. I don't mind. I would rather you have the right part than suffer at the hands of me not refunding you for buyers remorse or not doing your reasearch.  Its not just our responsibility as business owners to somehow fabricate out of thin air a pleasurable experience. IT takes both parties actively participating in the pleasantries and being considerate. If you're a wishy washy whiny pants, I'm going to take your money and tell you where to go with your new part. 

There are people out there who are not attentive and not considerate. I won't serve those people. I refuse to do business with impatient narcicistic egomaniacs. I will not cater to a person's indecisive meandering when it costs me money. In the past i have gone waaaaaaayyyyyy over the line to help people. I refunded a guy and re-sold his board once because his mom threatened to kick him out if he didn't get rid of it. That was a $2400 build. I should have told him to suck it up. ITs not my problem he didn't comply with the local matriarch's tyranny. But i understood it and the guy was earnest. But then there's the guy who just changed his mind about some part he ordered a-la-cart because better deal elsewhere... No. 

So far I have had very, very few of these impatient, indecisive, and terrible people. 99% of my customers are great and are a pleasure to serve.

Preach on brotha!! Now that’s the BEST description of Excellent customer service, in my opinion. Anyone who disagrees or thinks you’re being harsh doesn’t know their Asshole from a Bagel Hole...
