Hey guys so currently we Dutchies are trying to get ESK8 legal in the Netherlands, so we started a petition. If you live in Holland, been in Holland or are planning to go to Holland and you want to ride your ESK8 please sign the petition. It would help us out a lot! At the time of posting this we have got 160 people that signed it lets bump that up!
Comments to keep the topic fresh are also appreciated :smiley:.
