Hey guys!
I have been doing some welding with the aulakiria welder aka the "boss level" spot welder. It works great! 

I am just wondering how other's welds look. Here is how mine looks so far...

A good spot weld is when you can't pull the strip off with pliers.

With these the nickel will tear if I try and pull it off.

welds are good, but you might want to do multiple layers if it's an eskate battery

Yup exactly what @Namasaki said. 

Also do not use the nickel strip that is provided with the welder. It‚Äôs nickel plated steel and is not suitable for our use. I just used them to play around with the welder when I first got it.

Performance varies with source voltage too so keep an eye on it as you go for changes and adjust accordingly

Yeah I heard that. This is 0.2 pure nickel from batterysupport. 

I also sanded a piece and threw it in some salt water. All good.

I also noticed that the temperature of the fets which is displayed makes a big difference too.

When it's at like 25¬∞C it's heaps stronger than at 35-40¬∞C

For 0.2 7ms is the usual flux time.

After messing around a bit, that seems about right.
