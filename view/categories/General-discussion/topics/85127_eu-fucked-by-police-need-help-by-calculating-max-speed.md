Guys need your help quickly!

Got fucked by police in Munich.  They took my board with them.

ERPM 10.000 with 97mm wheels is how much km/h?
```

Should be around 20kmh. I think. That's really bad. I am sorry man.

I guess it's 8.?? km/h.

not sure...

I came to 2.7km/h

97mm*3.14 = 304mm

10.000 u/m / 7 pole pairs = 1428,57 u/min

1428,57 u/m * (15/40 gearing) = 535,71 u/min

535,71 u/min * 0,304m = 162 m/min 

162m/min / 60 = **2,7 km/h?**

(from my semester thesis, ERPM=f_1)

with your 14/40 gearing and 97mm abecs I get. 2.72m/s = 9.79km/h

probably a bit lower with losses, but Im not sure about that..

We also have 20kmh in Belgium. I hope so one they bring it to 25kmh. As long it's alound is good. Then you need to pay attention. But at least you can cruise most of the time and when you are alone do some sprints for fun. Sub 30kmh is a good speed to reach your destition farly fast and safe. 6kmh it's just not possible. Then I would kick instead.

It is ment for elderly e-bikes as a startup help. If it surpasses that speed it gets categorized as a motorized vehicle=car so you need insurance, a seat, licence plate, T√úV etcetc

I hope they approve the new planed 20kmh speed law soon...

that's stupid, why would the police pull you over... at least in NYC the cops just don't care (yet)

I can't even imagining cruising at 20 km/h that's just pure slow, 35 km/h is more my speed. and saying you have an esk8 and cruising at 6 km/h is just embarrassing as a normal skateboard will fly past you. :face_with_symbols_over_mouth::face_with_symbols_over_mouth::joy:

How did they clock your speed don't you all have the same innocent until proven guilty and burden of proof on the police?  Calculated values don't matter unless it's actually being used... most cars are capable of going way over any speed limits in the US it doesn't mean you can't drive them.

Speed doesnt really matter... if they can see that u are going over 6km/h, they make a spot traffic check... and then u have to show them your driver licence, because its motor powered and faster then 6km/h. Then u have to show them the insurace. Every motorrized vehicle needs that in germany... here is the big thing! 

No insurance is a huge crime...

Rough!!!
motor rpm x wheel height(in inches) / trans ratio x 146 = mph

There has to be a plug and play calc for that online?? I'm new to esk8 but learning.

If it matters you can divide your given rpm by your gear ratio, then multiply a new ratio and the net difference is the rpm change you will see at the same given road speed. 

I don't know what your final drive ratio (or gearing) is or I'd do the math 4 U. 
Good luck getting your ride back!!
Can you insure your board in the US??  May have helped my parents when I accidently broke a bank's window with my aluminum deck waaaayyy back in the 70's.  Ouch-

Well saw in the noobs thread you have metr, if you have your settings correct for number of poles, pulley ratio, and wheel size then it should also be giving you accurate numbers, here if you aren't breaking any laws you can't be asked to stop and identify.  I do like the idea of being able to get insurance for my ride and just in case someone ever tried to pin an accident on me but otherwise just assume medical insurance is really all I need (in America you must have medical or your life will be hell)

---

Just fact checked myself and a little off, it varies state by state some places they just can't stop you and ask for ID

https://www.ilrc.org/sites/default/files/resources/stop_identify_statutes_in_us-lg-20180201v3.pdf

---

Another thought/question on this, why do you need insurance on an esk8?  Is it that your body is going to be hit by a car and you need to pay for the damages to the car if you're at fault? Does the same thing apply to bikers or pedestrians? if no why not?

so true. but you can ride an ebike in germany that goes up to 30kmh and there is no law to use a helmet while riding and you need no insurance.
I think 30kmh free for all electric vihicles would be fair, but we all know the endless greed of the government.
EDIT: they want us to pay taxes, pay for an insurance, pay for energy and so on. Dont know that much about american laws, but in germany you have to pay for everything you do several times. just one payment is never enough in germany...you have to pay taxes if your a poor pig for collecting bottles in the streets.
This country just sucks

That could be the reason for the mellow s  version which only goes up to 20 kmh.
In my personal case, i never had any problems with the police and im riding almost every day. Last night the police passed me at 23 o clock while i was riding my 4WD 30 to 35 kmh i think and they just told me through an open window of their car that i have to ride on the sidewalk. 
Its weird but this happens to me almost every day for about 2 years now.God bless nothing more.

Yeah i read this thread and you came along with just one blue eye this time.
I always watch out for the police while riding, but sometimes they come from behind or they are lurking around a corner you cannot see them. Its just a matter of time and mood of the police officers if they want to catch you or not. Like i mentioned: god bless the officers must like me because i can ride almost any speed so far without any trouble, but im very gentle skater at daylight and when kids, people and dogs around.
Maybe this is a point for them, if they see  that i am not only at high speed moving.
I am always demonstrating emergency braking to the people around when i see they are afraid of me coming along.

I also keep an eye out for the police on every trip. :roll_eyes:

Once I have been in M√ºnster at night on a bicycle path as in far away a car has driven on the bicycle path. I only saw the lights and knew that could only be the police. I started to fake push and as the car came closer it was the police but they didn't notice anything. 

Another time I was on a path when suddenly 2 policemen stood 30 meters in front of me. I put on a full brake, turned my board around and drove directly in the other direction lol.
