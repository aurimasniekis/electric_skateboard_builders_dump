I was wondering if anyone had any experience buying from Bang good, it was recommended in the discord the other day and was wondering if anyone else could weigh in on this retailer. I'm in Canada so I want to avoid paying duties if I can.

Looking at these [motors](https://www.banggood.com/HGLRC-Flipsky-6354-190KV-2450W-Brushless-Sensored-Motor-Shaft-8mm-for-Electric-Skateboard-Rc-Models-p-1323575.html?rmmds=buy) and these [VESCS](https://www.banggood.com/FLIPSKY-FSESC-50A-SK8-ESC-Electronic-Speed-Control-5V-BEC-for-Electric-Longboard-RC-Car-E-bike-p-1293459.html?rmmds=buy&cur_warehouse=CN)

I ordered a cheaper one on other sites.  Received it without any problem.  If you search around you might find one under $50usd![Screenshot_20190131_205039|233x500](upload://gfmzlBXQBO8UNWi8sB3k41saN2K.jpeg)

They deliver fine to Aus.  They turn the order round quickly and have always delivered in the time frame stated.

I ordered my motor's from Banggood as well as a bunch of other things. Definitely worth it in my opinion, it removes the need for shipping prices at a cost of time. They have good CS. 

I am from Quebec, and I rarely pay duty fees and sometimes I pay their duty/tax free insurance which isn't usually much. But if you opt for express shipping which is usually through DHL you will definitely pay a fee for your order (in most cases at least). Most of my orders through Banggood/DHL were maximum 30cad fees.
