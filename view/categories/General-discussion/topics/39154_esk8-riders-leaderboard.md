hola!

**TL;DR**

i'm creating a leaderboard to compete individually or as a team-country.
any electric skateboard is welcome, doesn't matter if you ride a DIY or evolve, boosted, metroboard, whatever...

website
http://esk8race.com (alpha version, it can be very buggy)

how does it work?
http://esk8race.com/how_work/

where does the data come from
[http://www.sports-tracker.com/?](http://www.sports-tracker.com/)
[https://www.endomondo.com/](https://www.endomondo.com/)
[https://www.strava.com/?](https://www.strava.com/)

i recommend you to use strava if do you want to keep your privacy and don't show all your activities as public.

(maybe in a future i will add more plataforms, but is not easy to get the raw data of the activities)

**Long story**

i got this great idea from a facebook group Evolve Skateboard Owners, Max Chin publishes every week a screenshot of a leaderboard using the app sports tracker, something like this
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/4/7/477dc16488e45c4932eb4d6241703ebbe8128b47.jpg" width="281" height="500">

i tried to implement the same idea with some friends in Spain, but it sucks... the feature of leaderboard only is visible on the iphone version of sports tracker app. (android FTW)

and if you want to check the leaderboard you have two options:
1- wait to see an screenshot from the leaderboard admin
2- each user has to follow or add as a contact everyone in the list to be able to see the same leaderboard members.

so i'm working on an idea like this but with more features because they only can compete by "ridden time"

**compete by distance ridden**

**compete by top speed reached**
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/7/4/74dee07b8908cfe15d38c379f82f4979e393c7a2.png" width="373" height="453">

**compete  by total ridden time**
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/9/3/93bec23681eff5d3a44047389c953e39b54282c8.png" width="373" height="453">

**compete by ridden distance, top speed reached and ridden time as a team-country**
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/b/0/b008920902197623e03931e2ccf304f93da9fab1.png" width="373" height="285">

**do you want to join us?**

check the instructions below
http://esk8race.com/how_work/

very important, you need to complete your sports tracker profile with username, country, location or esk8race won't read your profile and check your spam inbox to click the validation email.

**future crazy ideas**

- get the data from other plataforms.

- check leaderboards from previous months.

- create your own group to compete with the group members or as a team with other groups.

- compete by city not just by country.

- create events and check events near you.

-------------------------

**any feedback it will be apreciated, if you have a problem send me a private message**

-------------------------

**do you have an DIY electric skateboard?** 

please check my another website [http://esk8builds.com](http://esk8builds.com) and add your own :)

Would be nice if I could just have an account on the leaderboard and submit data logged from the metr module (could maybe have filters or icons to indicate user submitted vs app pulled data).

https://metr.at/r/rKZvg

in that page the window.groute has all the data I imagine @rpasichnyk might have a query param or some way we can get the JSON data out directly from the upload too.

i would like to gather the data automatically, i talked with @rpasichnyk to do it but for now its not possible because metr.at doesn't have user accounts.

thread over here where he explains the module too beyond what's on the site

http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/configuration-and-telemetry-for-vesc-ios-android/13483/599

really if you follow the setup on the site though shouldn't have a problem.

There’s a bug somewhere. I got it up to 26.7 mph according to the sporting app but your website says I only got 8 mph... other than that this website is top notch. I like that I don’t need a VESC to log the data.

Now I just need to register, start my motorbike, start the app and I should easily get the first place for speed :stuck_out_tongue:

updates!

**metr.at added! (beta version)**

@wafflejock @rpasichnyk 

the difference with other apps like strava, endomondo, sports tracker, is that you need to upload the activity by yourself on esk8race website.

1- create a new account with the metr.at tracker (at this moment you can only use 1 activity tracker app)

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/e/e/ee21e386714d3a3a56ce04da9cbbc5502a03db8a.png" width="449" height="128">

2- login in your account

3- upload new activities with a link eg. https://metr.at/r/rKZvg

4- Done! Your stats will be updated.

Hi loving the leaderboard! Great idea.

I notice that rides I made more than 24hrs ago aren't showing up -- is this a tracker problem?

Hiya @tueboard thanks for setting this up I was able to register and get an email for verification but I clicked the verify link and after that still can't login anyway you can check on the DB or let me know what to do.  Only weird thing I did is use a password generator to make a crazy password but not sure what it's hung up on.

Thanks a heap!

I also notice that top speeds are often gps errors (I know I've never reached 66.7 k/hr -- far too scary!)

I'm not sure what can be done about this though but it is kind of misleading.

yes, something is wrong with gps and i don't know how to handle this, this is why some people asked me to create the average speed leaderboard

I also notice you can dominate the avg speed list in one short fast ride -- possible suggestion is to break down avg speeds to short, medium and long distances.

Cheers

I mean if people want to exploit to get top ranks there is not much you can do about it when it comes to GPS based systems which you can just spoof etc. For me it's just cool to see what people are up to and compare etc. One suggestion is can you add an all time ranking for each category as well?
