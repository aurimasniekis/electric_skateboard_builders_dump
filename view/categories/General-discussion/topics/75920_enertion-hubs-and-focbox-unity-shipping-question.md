I purchased the Focbox Unity and Enertion Hubs a couple days ago (woohoo)! I was wondering when the hubs would ship cause would they ship with the focbox? On the topic of Focboxes, when will the ones ordered on Black Friday be shipped?

**If someone has said this topic before, can someone link that convo**

Unity and Hubs Should be shipping at the end of the month.
My understanding is there are plenty of normal FBoxs in stock. 

Cheers mate.
