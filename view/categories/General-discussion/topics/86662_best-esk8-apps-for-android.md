Hi everyone,

I've got a Bluetooth module and I want to start recording my rides. I'm looking for an app that allows me to store ride data such as total distance, average speed, maximum speed, etc. I'd also like to see my battery percentage and stuff aswell.

Any suggestions on apps (Android)?

Thanks

Search "android app" in the search bar, chances are someone has already asked.  I'd suggest Ackmaniac app though

If you use the Akmaniac app you need to flash your VESCs FW first, dont forget.
