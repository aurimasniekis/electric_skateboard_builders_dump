21700 batteries are the future for high energy density li-ion batteries. It took awhile but the vape market has almost completely switched over to them with the Samsung 40t being the battery of choice. Obviously esk8 requires more batteries so they are more cost prohibitive. But removing cost from the equation, the 21700 is just a superior cell. I feel like if I build a 18650 pack today I'm using last gen tech, in a few yrs no one will be using 18650s.

Last time I checked 21700 had worse energy density than 30Q cells plus they are more expensive. The added diameter also makes them worse for slim builds. Don't really see the benefit compared to top of the line 18650s besides high current capabilities.

What makes the 21700 superior for you?

Efest has a 21700 with an actual tested capacity of 4900mah. These things are barely bigger than a 18650, certainly smaller than two 18650s.

Just do me a favor and calculate the volumetric energy density for it compared to a Sanyo nga with 3500mAh and Samsung 30Q. Then also do the gravimetric calculation. Let's talk once we have these numbers. 

PS: efest is not a manufacturer AFAIK. They relabel big brand cells. So which cell is it really?

Possibly a Samsung 48g, I realize that but you can't deny that it got the highest capacity and mooch's tests are on point. I have both batteries in my hand right now and I can't tell you the calculations but what I do know is that the size difference is not noticeable and I get at least 30% more battery life out of it.

Edit: Efest is a LG M50

A 48g has a higher voltage drop than a 30Q in the first half of the charge cycle.
The difference in size is enormous (~44% in volume). Not sure what's better with the 48g then besides slightly higher energy density. 

Unfortunately lygyte has no test of the M50 so I can't compare.

Practical examples are key, given 295mm of length to place batteries a single strip of 21700 would give you 68,600mah while 18650 would give you 56000mah.

Something in your calculations must be off then considering a 18650 being 18x65mm and a 2170 being 21x70mm. That makes the 2170 46,4% bigger in volume than the 18650.

Edit The 18650 is 31,6% smaller than the 21700. The 21700 is 46,4% bigger than the 18650 :smile:

Incorrect, 16540 is 68.22% of 24245. Basic math. Thickness is 3mm different. Voltage is much less of an issue when you are running so many batteries because the voltage stacks.

What? To calculate the size difference I based my numbers on the increase and not decrease. So my numbers are 242/165 which is 146.67% - basic math.

Voltage is an issue as it limits your top speed. What series count do you achieve with your 21700 in 295mm?

Ok I've had a good day so far so I am gonna go the extra mile here:

There is a difference between caclulating a volume increase or volume decrease. Basically it's the inverse.
A 21700 is 46%(242/165=146%) bigger than a 18650 while a 18650 is 32%(165/242=68%) smaller than a 21700. So there is a difference and context matters.

Next thing is the cell count. Lets limit our calculation on a 12S battery as that is usually the maximum we would use.
A 12S1P 18650 battery is 12 * 18mm=216mm in length and 65mm in width. The same in 21700 would be 12 * 21mm=252mm in length and 70mm in width. Or in other words: in the same length of the 12S 18650 battery you would only be able to fit a 10S 21700 battery.

You can't say that unless you're clear about your perspective. A 2 foot stick is 100% longer than a 1 foot stick, but a 1 foot stick is 50% shorter than a 2 foot stick... You can't just say length difference between 1 and 2 feet is 100% as it doesn't make sense unless we know the perspective.

There is no difference between a volume increase and volume decrease. Where is your proof? Percentages are always calculated by dividing by the larger number. Why limit our series to 12 batteries? Our only limit is 295mm of space.

so you can't say something is twice as big as something else? 

because making that would actually force you to divide the larger number by the smaller...

Wait a second. I think I just  might have solved this;

18650/21700 = 86%, so the 18650 is 86% as good as the 21700. 21700 clearly wins! 

Or wait, is it 2170? Then the 2170 is (2170/18650) only 11,6% as good as the 18650. 18650 is superior!

So, assuming we're paying per cubic inch (using imrbatteries prices), 

buying 40T will cost 13,35 USD per cubic inch, which will give us 9,62 kWh, 
= 1,39 usd/ci/kWh

buying 30Q will on the other hand cost 5,74 USD per cubic inch, which will give us 10,34 kWh,
= 0,56 usd/ci/kWh

Does a possible discharge of 25-30A per cell compared to 15-20A motivate a buy of this cell at 2,5 times the price of a 30Q (volume and capacity equaled out)? 

Or does one just like bulkier cells?

Ugh, this thread enjoys annoys me too, but for the other reasons.  Now I know this certainly doesn't matter AT ALL, but if y'all really are gonna get technical about the energy densities and amount of space these both take up, perhaps recognize that your not using rectangular cells.  No one bothered with a simple ((pi*r^2) * height)= area.  Granted, it would still result with the same percentages... Just a little thing to point out since apperantly that was the point of the thread, not to discuss these new cells beyond anything but their relative size to one another.

FWIW, I also don't see why it's such a huge deal when bringing up it's energy densities compared to a 30Q, UNLESS (and this is capitalized, so pay attention) size restrictions AND price are more important than over all battery size and power and capacity, etc...  I've proposed this same argument a few times to get the same negative feedback, but each time I said that space, and money were not an issue!  Yet that's all that was focused on.  If I have the money and space to build a 12s6p out of insanely expensive Samsung 40T's, can anyone at all tell me how that is stupid and a worst battery than I'd get if I had just used the 30Q instead, and you have to make the argument WITHOUT (important again) bringing up size or cost.

Ok......   :gun: GO!!!

Everyone else took calc a yr. and a half ago? I agree, thus why I said it was middle school math. My proportions have always been correct. 

I thought we were comparing the 4900mah 10A 21700 to the 3500mah 10A 18650. But if we are comparing the 30q to the 40t and we have a length of 295mm to cover with batteries the 40t would give me 56000 combined mah and 420 combined A while the 30q would give me 48000 combined mah and 240 combined A. Obviously the 21700 is 5mm longer but 2 strips side by side set up like the battery pack in the Raptor 2 adds just 10mm in width to your battery pack and 3mm in height.

They are obviously perfectly fine to use. Nobody ever said otherwise. People also use 26650 lifepo and they can if they want to. But in general a top of the line 18650 is the better compromise.

For a cells true ratings, regardless of if it's a known brand or a rewrap are kind of irrelevant, so long as you determine their actual values.  I usually defer to Mooch on these matters.
