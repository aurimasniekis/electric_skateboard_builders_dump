They my count it as a personal item and let your carry it on. I think you can have a backpack, carry-on bag, and one personal item. I have a short deck that fits in my carry-on, and its set up for pumping and slalom with 4" tracker trucks and retro zig zags 66 wheels. I've taken many different decks with me on a lot of domestic fights, and a few international with no problems but never any kind of longboard.

Personally, I just strap it to my back pack with rope and call it all one carry on, haha. Never had an issues with it.

These are both short decks, 27 inches. I would rather carry them. I'm gonna strap them to out backpacks and hope they don't care.
