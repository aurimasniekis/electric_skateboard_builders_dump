As the US eSk8 Market grows I wanted to have 1  topic for all of the parts listed, instead of creating a separate topic for each item for sale. That said I want to run this like the 'No words just pictures' thread. Only the sellers post , and if you have a question use pm or the product inquiry feature on the website. I am trying to promote the website with out spamming the forums and I thought this would be the best way. (I hope you agree) 

Thanks for using the [eSk8 Market!](https://electric-skateboard.market)

I posted some belts in the US market place. They are 5M- 255mm/265mm length with widths 9mm, 15mm, and 25mm. I'm just gauging interest atm, all orders are pre-orders. If you buy more than 10 belts i will give you free shipping (to U.S), **If for any reason i am unable to get your order out within 1.5 weeks of your order date, your order will be free.**

Orders >15 belts will receive a discount from the posted price, pm for details.

I have got some Wii Kama nunchicks that I am not using. One black and one white. $15 a piece. I also have one dongle / receiver. I am not sure if it works, but am 99% sure that it does. My wiiceiver took a crap so I have no way to test it. I would like to get $10 for it and if it dosnt work I will refund you.

Just realized there was a problem with the system. I have updated it and now everything should work. I have reduced the price to $10 per Kama.
