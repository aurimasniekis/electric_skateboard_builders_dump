After running a few group buys I saw the need for quality parts at a more affordable price. I also saw the need for more kits to make building your own eSk8 even easier. That is why I have created Polar, a eSk8 Kits and Parts vendor!

@JLabs congrats on the kickoff! Even though you have a cool logo, keep the parts stealth and unbranded!

Hopefully we dont leave the EU and if we do there should be trade agreements set in place for exports and imports

[/quote]

I actually hope not - otherwise it is like having all the benefits of a member but without the responsibility and obligations.
But sure, first of all I also hope they somehow manage to stay in the first place.

Yes, all of the motors and esc's are reliable and tested. That is why I chose them. They are the same ones offered by DIYelectricskateboard (TB).

We WILL leave the EU, as that's what the majority voted for, but I am pretty certain we will still be able to ship to the EU - you don't need a trade agreement to ship ANYWHERE in the world. We can ship to China, America, Canada, Timbuktu without a "trade agreement" - sheesh - the British public buy into political nonsense too easily :slight_smile:

Seriously. You make me laugh. Anyone can import and export to anywhere in the world. You don't need to be a memeber of the EU to do that.....

All that being an EU member means, in relation to shipping,  is that there is no tax to pay at the delivery point as the seller puts VAT on at source. So you pay it anyhow, just less admin. When you buy from outside the EU, you get taxed when it arrives in the county, by the shipping company. Either way, you pay 20% (in the UK) when buying goods outside the country. It makes no difference.You pay it either way.

There doesn't need to be trade agreements for imports and exports. You can still import and export. All trade agreements are are systems to ease trade with less paperwork , and agree tax rates and tax concessions that suit both countries - if at all.

When I buy from America, I pay 20% VAT when the goods arrive in the UK, and **perhaps** some duty. Duty is charged if our government decide they want to protect an internal market from cheap overseas imports. Within the EU there is no duty as it's an open market, but the EU charges duty to anyone importing into the EU as they want to artificially protect the EU market as a whole. Part of the reason so many of us voted out. We wont' want to be in an artificially protected market, we want to survive on our own merits.

First I wondered what your weird and somehow aggresive posts had to do with anything i said. But then I realized you are one of those people that actually think you will be better off outside of the EU. Good luck - will see how it turns out :thumbsup:

Quit trolling Roger.

Jlabs, I'm gonna buy the winning or micro remote, but not sure how big the winning one is. Could you put a comparative pic of it in a hand so i can compare it (same as the micro one)? Or put the dimensions in the description?

Love the website as well, nice and clean and easy to navigate, best of luck with it.

Thank you for the compliments on the website. This picture is from @Michaelinvegas I currently only have the Mini, and @ajaynagra has the nano. I think the nano is a bit so small. But in the end it is your decision.

I am 16 and I'm working on my first build so I have a tighter budget. Would this work for a single motor setup? Also, is there anything I should be aware of if I go with your kit? It looks amazing and I'm really interested. I want to do 2 6s 5000mah batteries and I think I want to use the diy electric skateboard trucks and mounts

Yes it would work great for a single motor setup, depending on your weight I would get either the 6354 or the 6374 motor. Running the sensored setup on the FVT 6s esc is risky because you have to get the perfect wiring or your fry it, but in unsensored mode it is very reliable. If you are going 12s then the 12s esc is bullet proof but does not have sensor ports. Both motors fit DIY mounts. If you have any further questions feel free to PM me.

Hi Patrick, I received your email.

The dimensions are as follows:
10s3p-
L: 12in
W: 5.25
H: <2

10s4p-
L: 16in
W: 5.25
H: <2

The BMS is 77a Continuous discharge with a built in eSwitch. The BMS also has a temperature sensor so if the pack gets to warm it will shut it off. If you have any other questions you can either email or PM me :)
