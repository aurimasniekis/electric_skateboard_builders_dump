What materials you guys use to minimize the vibration forcing to your batteries during driving.
Think about neoprene tape etc. 
If somebody has a good idea what and where to get something like this cheap, I would be happy if you share this with me.

üòÇFor what all this fitness things can be used. With my last build I couldn‚Äôt find a good rubber tape which is enough hight. Ended up cutting a Thera tape (this flexi silicon expander thing for home gym training) and glued it to the edges of my enclosure. 100% waterproof ‚òùÔ∏è

Foam type thingy from shipping packages tend to work good.

 Though not sure where to buy one locally, so i suppose yoga mats should work nicely.

I was just finding something to mount my ESC to my board the other day and I ended up buying some vertical mounting double sided tape that had a good thickness of foam/rubber material from my local hardware store. It's rated to hold 5.4kgs (12lbs)

They tend to melt in higher heat, thats true.. 

Hadnt really thought what would happen in fire.. the rest would be toasted then anyways, i think

As long as they don‚Äôt start burn from a spark or melt away at 40 degrees, i‚Äòm fine with it

I use weather stripping for both that and also for sealing the battery enclosure (e.g.: https://www.homedepot.ca/en/home/p.premium-sponge-weatherstrip-316x38x17-ft-black.1001121257.html)

My first build:

Corning 737 neutral cure silicone.
https://www.ellsworth.com/products/by-market/consumer-products/sealants/silicone/dow-corning-737-neutral-cure-sealant-silicone-clear-300-ml-cartridge/

its safe for electronics and doesn't reek of cat piss. Its actually pleasant to use and the smell reminds of of a day at the pool. Touchable in about 20 minutes or so, fully cured over night. Lay some down in the bottom of the box, squish your pack onto it, then run a bead around the outside of the bottom of the pack where it meets the box and use a popsicle stick to smooth it up. If the walls of the box are really close to the pack, fill the gap with silicone too. 

I pot my packs this way and they stay put.

It does a great job damping vibrations. You could use it to build out your whole box with zero fasteners if you wanted. It makes maintenance take a day longer but if you're trying to ride more and tinker less its a good option.

I used industrial velcro stuck it on the board and then stuck the other half on the battery. It may not dampin as much as yoga mat but I think it works well

Silicon is not the problem.
Need to find the right translation for less smell for silicons. If it continues like that i soon speak perfect technical russian...

1/4" art foam works great and you can hot glue and stack to make it as thick as you want.

 An interesting method I've seen is @whitepony who uses felt around his packs. Looks super clean. 
I also use art foam and industrial Velcro. Seems to work pretty good so far. I also built like armor made from a cheap thin cutting board i bought from the dollar store which place around the entire pack after fish paper. Then i shrink wrapped it. Very tidy. No worrying about vibrations rubbing and shorting the pack.

I use outdoor generic double sided foam tape. several layers if needed. 

If it needs to be stuck down hardcore I use 3M VHB. Don't expect to be able to remove that in the future though. Its black magic adhesive.
