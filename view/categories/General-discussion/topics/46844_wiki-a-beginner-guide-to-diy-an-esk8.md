**_A beginner guide to DIY an ESK8_**

_So you want to build your own electric skateboard but don‚Äôt know where or how to start? No worry this guide will cover the basics of DIY‚Äôing your ESK8. If you want more in-depth guides about some particular subjects, use the search function of the forum. You will find what you're looking for!_

Some more blog posts you can find [here](https://electricboardsolutions.com/).

_Very short:_

The 3 big components are the motor, the ESC and the battery
‚Ä¢	The motor gives the mechanical power to your wheels
‚Ä¢	The ESC (electric speed controller) is the brain of your eks8, it controls the motor using the electric power from the batteries
‚Ä¢	The batteries give the electric power needed for your motor

**1. Motors and motor types**

 ![image|168x167](upload://4GjebJ5mluZEzYm86FHq3bXJoEU.jpg)
_a. Kv, Watt &dimensions_

‚Ä¢	Kv or RPM/V or (Rounds per minute)/applied volt is a unit to tell how fast a motor will spin depending on the applied voltage.
‚Ä¢	Watt [W] is the unit for power, mostly for esk8 motors this will vary between 500W to 3500W per motor. 1HP is 736W, so the strongest motors can go up to almost 5HP (!)
‚Ä¢	The motors dimensions are given by diameter and length. For example a 6355 motor has 63mm√ò and 55mm length.

_b. Unsensored & sensored motor_

Most motors have just 3 wires, unsensored motors
![image|141x115](upload://9Ja1B5nKoIeFwAzG6iL0FzXfAfE.jpg)
 
The sensored motors are a bit more expensive and have a fourth cable the ‚Äúsensor cable‚Äù. This sensor cable detects the position of the rotor. That is why sensored motors are better for smooth startup and helps the ESC to be more efficient. 
![image|171x110](upload://qzkjKwqSmoF7PNv3chTTIr6FpyC.jpg)

 

_c. Hub motor_

The latest upcoming trend in ESK8 technology are the hub motors, these motors are built in your esk8 wheel. 
![image|200x165](upload://kyYwyDLsELd6MiTkGk42NjNgLQj.jpg)
 

**2. Mechanical parts for belt drivetrain** _( a great in depth guide about electric skatboard drivetrains you can find [here](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/beginners-guide-to-building-your-own-electric-skateboard-drivetrain/53) by @onloop)_

_a. Pulleys and belts_
 ![image|163x185](upload://fYAHeSkPTZvnkYY1pXG0xlyyvn8.jpg)
Most used is the HTD profile with a pitch of 5mm. You will need a pulley for the motor and a pulley for the wheel and a belt to connect them.
There are different ways to connect the pulleys to the wheel/motor.

The motor pulley is mostly fixed to the motor axle with adjustment screws or a key & keyway. Always check the motor axle diameter and the pulley bore diameter! Most common 6/8/10mm.
![image|200x200](upload://ljQQUDugYmr2WV0kekgk8z0Y0iv.jpg)![image|200x200](upload://xT3Ktx5AqgJsfsnIJmT0eoOVoEd.jpg)

The wheel pulley can be fixed to the wheel with screws or kept in place with a bearing and coupler (you will need an adjusted truck).
![image|281x154](upload://jof9lrXi131XNwU0rh215r8eHoi.jpg)![image|131x174](upload://9oDsdBekK4BC1YWzljGQI505oc5.jpg)
 

   


_b. Mounts_

Mounts are used to fix the motor to the truck, most used systems are:

Caliber trucks in combination with this clampmount:
![image|285x144](upload://2oMEqLI9ejO12x7c6vaB99cr96W.jpg)![image|320x240](upload://ApkcRtLqr2bnou1zrm4QIqzRRRB.jpg)
  
Or

Special designed truck for esk8

_c. Wheels_
Mostly used wheels are flywheel clones, because they cheaper and have holes in the core.
![image|119x119](upload://mnu0e7zoUC1zSmI9XyPj9uQLjQp.jpg)
  
Other common used wheels are the abec flywheels or orangatang kegel wheels.
![image|210x100](upload://ywQVQZtYKkHWcHE5qTFono8azKL.jpg)
 
In fact you can use any wheel if you‚Äôre whiling to drill holes in it üòâ

**3. ESC**

_a.  ESC_

ESC or electric speed controller is the brain from you esk8 and controls the motor. The ESC‚Äôs used for esk8‚Äôs are mostly RC car ESC‚Äôs e.g. Hobbyking X-car 120A, the RC car ESC‚Äôs can be used for budget builds.
Two important parameters you should check when looking for an ESC are; the number of cells in serie (s) (look further at point 4. Batteries) and the rated Amperage [A].
For example: https://hobbyking.com/en_us/hobbykingr-tm-x-car-beast-series-esc-1-8-scale-120a.html, the hobbyking X-car ESC is rated for 120A and 3-6s (serie cels) LiPo.
For your build you will be looking for at least 6s ESC‚Äôs & batteries.

_b. VESC¬Æ_

A very famous ESC, that is specially designed for electric vehicles like electric skateboards is the VESC¬Æ. The VESC¬Æ designed by Benjamin Vedder, an engineer from Sweden.
A VESC¬Æ allows very smooth startup/braking and silent motors. It also gives the opportunity to change a lot of parameters, like max Amp, voltage cut off, overheat,‚Ä¶

You will find a lot very good in depth guides about the VESC on this formum, just use the search function. A great youtube video you can find[ here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=775&v=v1glLDO-EjA).

**Attention:** One known Issue that some people have with their VESC compatible ESCs is that when you roll down hill faster than your boards electric top speed, brakes become unpredictable. It might happen that when trying to apply light brakes, The ESC will do a full brake instead.

**4. Batteries** _(A great in depth guide about batteries you can find [here](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/new-user-looking-for-battery-read-this-complete-walkthrough-of-batteries/26010) by @evoheyax , about C-rating [here](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/what-is-battery-c-rating-is-it-important-for-electric-skateboards/36) by @onloop & about terminology and formulae [here](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/the-terminology-formulae-and-physical-assembly-of-lipo-batteries-or-wtf-does-c-mean/33162) by @Clonkex )_
![image|163x163](upload://p2OQV0trxIFhTVOOKRdyJnYkEsK.jpg) ![image|188x176](upload://boBblRRaWt2tAvexEEHPemEY7wS.jpg)  
Li-ion cell			                  LiPo cell

_a. Voltage, amps, c-rating, Ah_
A battery consists of a certain number of cells placed in series or parallel (look below).

Each cell has a voltage window where it should stay in all the time!
For LiPo commonly used numbers: 3.2V/cell(completely discharged)-4.2V/cell(completely charged)
For Li-Ion commonly used numbers: 2.7V/cell(completely discharged)-4.2V/cell(completely charged)
The capacity (how far you will be skating with your battery) is given in Ah or mAh. The number of amperes a battery can give for an hour. For example, a 5Ah batterie can give 5Amps for the time of 1 hour or 20amps for 15 minutes etc‚Ä¶ Another commonly used unit for batteries is Wh or (V*A)h or power it can give for one hour.
A battery that‚Äôs being used will give current, the unit is amperes [A], the max current a battery can deliver is based on the C-rating. A higher c-rating means higher price. Li-ion will be around 5-8C, Lipo‚Äôs can go up to 20-40C (!). To know the max continuous discharge current multiply the C-rating by the capacity. For example, a 5Ah(5000mAh) LiPo battery with a 20C rating can give 100amperes(!) continuous discharge.

_b. Serie & parallel SP_

Battery cells can be placed in series or parallel
![image|350x175](upload://4i39bryqClXefOKPTMOncFYbkMc.png)

 

The abbreviation for series and parallel is S and P.
For example a batter pack that says 8s4p means 8cells in series and 4 in parallel meaning there are 32 cells in the pack.
Batteries in esk8‚Äôs commonly have 6-12s (cells in serie) and depending on using lipo or lion 1-4p (cells in parallel). The capacity varies between 5Ah to 10Ah.

_c. Charging & BMS_

When charging a battery it‚Äôs very important that all the cells stay at the same voltage and never go higher than 4.2V/cell. To do that you will need a balance charger or a BMS (battery management system). The balance charger needs to know which voltage each cell has to be able to ‚Äúbalance‚Äù each cell equally, that‚Äôs why the most battery packs have a balance wire (look bellow). The bigger wires are for charging and discharging, they are thicker because they need to conduct more current.
![image|226x169](upload://38dDU7WyZ6OK6dLzbiO83DWwp6L.jpg)   ![image|213x158](upload://kq56lpEFIOUYz7GSNxboY64dSiV.jpg)
This is a balance charger, mostly used to charge LiPo‚Äôs:
![image|229x170](upload://eHgIEyWAuxBEq1sOtljvOYKgHmF.jpg)
 
A battery management system or BMS is a PCB (printed circuit board) that can be placed in your board with your batteries which allows you to charge your batteries with a laptop like charger without taking them out. 
![image|196x163](upload://p82aWVRfEooO2jVIsvg7TvTdt8x.jpg)
 
_d. Switch and fuse_

To protect yourself and your batteries it‚Äôs suggested to use a switch or fuse or both.
The cheapest switch is a loop key
![image|156x125](upload://18vuxyNDQB3yZHsewg2Cwgp91b9.jpg)![image|211x118](upload://nnEdvkwdDFQT1HEvFtBQpIfQUMJ.jpg)![image|210x123](upload://3PONmMgFe4SYa5XJ1KC30JsX4Rm.jpg)

     
**5. Remote**

Ofcourse you need to control your esk8, that‚Äôs why you will need a remote, there are several options. From RC car remotes to Bluetooth app‚Äôs to specially designed esk8 remotes.

Hobbyking GT2B			Maytech esk8 remote
  ![image|228x167](upload://sfbDDchkGbI1nX4wfOUxq8ed4Rl.jpg) ![image|239x153](upload://mVPYeTvn0rJ0SajlUg2gXyCEOlA.jpg)

**6. Enclosure**

To safely store your electronics under your board you‚Äôre egoing to need a case. For this there are several options. You can use a bread box, design and 3D print your enclosure, make it from wood, make it from metal or buy a thermoformed enclosure.
![image|148x111](upload://yJJcixmeGhzoLuxkAME1YdEKlyt.jpg)


**7. Deck** _(a great in depth guide about decks you can find [here](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/what-deck-is-best-for-building-your-own-electric-skateboard/30) by @onloop)_

We need to pin this post to the top. Very helpful to get newbies started without making and or asking new questions that have been answered multiple times.

I believe that today its thousand times cheaper and easier to make eboard with many high quality parts and suppliers around the world. However the basic knowledge is not well known enough just yet. This is a great starting point. Thunbs up!

Brilliant thread!

I'd like to see more detail in just how the vesc functions or differs from a traditional brushless esc.

Also needs a skateboarding basics section based on the eskate demographic. Gaps exist in traditional skateboarding setup and safety knowledge. Things like deck purposes, truck types, angles, wheelbase, bushings and wheel types..

The whole idea of this forum is actually this post. Niw its being used more often as build perfection, parts sourcing and abit of show off. So this post put this forum and answers all of the questions I wonder when I started my journey as a builder few years back.

Off course there should be do's and dont's with tips and tricks following post, but this should give newbies excellent start.

Well I'm not sure how many people take the time to screw up a wiki page on purpose. 
  Honestly it doesn't matter what forum you go on you're going to get the same "dumb" questions over and over even if search was used.  Sure it's a pain sometimes but this sport is changing fast. What was the new hotness a few months ago might be old and busted by the time a new member searches(or doesn't) something.

Don't forget this

Very accurate if used correctly.  I use about 88% efficiency on dual.  Maybe someone has better numbers for single

This is a forum builder, a wiki would require a separate website framework. I don't think its necessary. This is enough to cover the ground basic concept. More or less people only need to know about which motor to pick, which battery to pick, which esc to pick, the necessary components needed and how everything is assembled. For people who build RC this is a no brainer, since I wasnt at the beginning knowing the overview scope make huge difference.

The details, shops and gimmicks are secondary thing. Its within members in their own time to make their builds better. But knowing how simple esk8 is, is the most important value.

Hey brotha, this is great!  I think if a noob reads through this they'll get a great perspective of what's involved in a build.  What' I'm finding lately is people asking of soldering is involved or any manipulation to the parts they purchase.  I think if a perspective builder is shying away from soldering and some tinkering, to make sure their parts work in concert, then maybe DIY isn't for them.  That could be a disclaimer or preface you might want to add.  When a noob sees the sum of these parts some individuals think its plug and play  Either way, this write up is super valuable to the community.  Awesome contribution!

Hi everyone,

New to this forum trying understand everything better. Not sure if I should write this here but I couldn't find how I open a new topic.

I am a MA student of design innovation and I chose for my major project to build an electric skateboard. I created a quick multiple choice questionnaire that takes only 1-2', to get some feedback of what people like.

I would much appreciate it if you can take a couple of minutes and fill it up, It will help me a lot.

Here's the link https://goo.gl/KVwp5y

Just filled out the form. Your points sometimes goes hand in hand or don¬¥t affect each other.
More range or topspeed? Bigger battery and you achieve both with more power and more range.
Better question would be topspeed vs. torque to see how people like it geared. Although a good setup has both ;)

Hey there guys.

I've been wanting to build my own electric longboard. But have no idea where to start or how to start.
I would like to have hub wheels instead of a belt driven motor. I also would like it to have a top speed of about 25mph and have power to get up hills with ease. My budget is about 600USD.

Can anyone lead me into the right direction as to what parts I should get, How to build it etc.

Thanks

Hey there, sorry I couldn't wait 17 hours so made another account.

Also any recommendations as to what companies I could get my parts from and what to stay away from?

I've decided on a 190KV Motor (Don't know which brand yet)
Also decided on 83mm Wheels ( Also don't know which brand)
And a 12S2P Battery pack ( Again, don't know which brand)
Also what ESC would you recommend?
What drive Pulley would you recommend?
What Wheel Pulley would you recommend?
What size belt?

I'd like to have a top speed of 45km/h so what size pulleys and belt will I need?

Really appreciate a quick response.

Thanks.

[quote="Savace, post:112, topic:46844"]
Ill try to explain it briefly, basically i have a 12s10p 18650 set up, board keeps cutting at 44volts (should be 50V full charged and can hit around 38V before needing recharge), this is a self build, there are **4** of the packs (pictured below ) in the board, each with **3** rows of **10** batteries ( 4 x 3 = 12s / 10 = series)

when taking the voltage across all the packs this is what it looks like

1st pack | | | X 3.53 3.28 3.53 10.4
2nd pack | | X | 3.8 3.8 3.8 11.68
3rd pack | X | | 3.8 3.8 3.8 11.67
4th pack X | | | 3.8 3.8 3.8 11.67

clearly the 1st pack is the problem which is what is in the pic - the middle row has the lowest voltage across it at 3.28. I have guessed two of the cells and cut them out the series and tested them and they both show 3.28.
so my question is - how can identify the bad cell - do i need to cut them all out and test - i have a feeling they have balance charged since the board cut out so none will be ‚Äúdead‚Äù

Hi There , Im starting to get my parts together for my first E Mountain Board.

Due research about my motor speed controller ESC or VESC I would like to add a note to the Beginners guide :slight_smile:
The ESC or VESC need to be set up with the right settings according to your Motor, Batterie and so on. This requires a Computer with software.
NOT all software is supported by Windows and Mac/IOS !
I found only one speed controller that supports software for IOS ( FOCBOX)
Anybody knows a decent speed controller with software for IOS?

This is wrong, kinda. so long as the vesc has a usable uart port, then a BT module can be used to connect to an ios application (Metr, xmatic, etc) meant for esc's (so long as that app is configured to play nice with whatever firmware you got). But thats not limited to just vesc's 

Hobbywings esc's have their own esc with application interaction.

So I have been looking a lot into upgrading my wowgo2s. It is a great eskate but I want something with a bit more torque and hill climbing ability. I am going to be doing this all in little pieces. I was looking at getting a focbox unity right now and later switch to a belt drive system. Any thoughts? Would the focbox unity work with my stock set up and remote?

No, many of us are looking for 5x2 onumatic wheels. If you can do a smaller MOQ and send ouy some samples to a couple of people to test we could probably do a group buy.

Hey all, I'm new to the forum and I need to post a question that I have about a VESC that I'm having a problem with.  However, when I try to create a new post it doesn't look like I have the privileges needed to create a post.

Do I need to be a member for a set amount of time before I can post a new topic?

preface, i don't use lipos.

you're going after 12s right?  if so, the way you have the batteries diagramed works out to a 6s2p.  if you're going for 12s, should be like this:

![image|690x485](upload://nPQRDtJ9BjLJI4qfUoK7G4j2cF5.png) 

also, the power connection to the two vescs are in serial.  you want that in parallel:

To connect in series put the + of one battery with the - of the other battery. This adds the voltage.

To connect in parallel put the + of one battery with the + of the other (and vice versa). This adds the capacities.

You can't add just one. You would have to add another three 4s batteries.

Say the batteries are 5000mAh. If you have three of them in series, that's three 5000mAh batteries. If you add another 5000mAh pack in parallel with one of the existing 5000mAh packs, you now have two 5000mAh packs and the equivalent of a 10000mAh pack. That will work (in that it won't immediately blow up), but as soon as you start using it, the 5000mAh pack voltages will drop much faster than the 10000mAh pack voltage and you'll end up with a severe voltage difference. This might simply kill the batteries or it might make them catch fire. Either way it's not something you want to do.

Good decision of choosing to build one! First is to decide if you want a single or dual drive motor build. If you are 70kg and below, a single drive is good for a first build. It's also cheaper than a dual since you need double motors, mounts, VESCs. If budget is not a problem, i'd recommend a dual drive. A mid range quality single drive build can cost just over $1k SGD, and about 1.5k for a dual.

Nice article! I am considering building an esk8 this summer and this forum is a lifesaver! This is my first post, so please be patient with me! Just a quick question, what material should the motor mount and pulleys be made out of? I have seen aluminum, carbon fiber, and even 3D printed versions. Also, does the strength and hardness of the pulleys affect their ability to perform optimally? For example, a 3D printed pulley versus an aluminum one. Thanks guys! :grinning:

Hello Guys, 
Unfortunately, Inboard technology gave me a board for $1500 that worked for only 2 months and to fix it they need me to pay another $500 + shipping cost. So, I need your help in choosing some parts for my e-skateboard while keep in mind that i'm outside the USA.

I have a battery with the below specifications and I need to understand how to choose a ESC and back truck compatible with that battery;

- Lithium-lon Battery
- Voltage: 43.2V nominal 49.2V peak
- Capacity: 97Wh 2.25Ah


Advanced Thanks.

For the esc it depends on your budget and how you will use your board . A good esc is called a vesc and you can change the settings however there is a diy version but there is no settings options. For the motors you will first have to decide between a hub motor which is less hassle to install with less maintenance or a belt drive which has a better performance.

Hi everyone! I didn't want to spam you guys with a new topic so I decided to reply here! I'm new here (just created an account), and I've been lurking the wikis and posts (without an account), and doing research (mostly YouTube and Reddit) for the past several weeks. I'm looking to build an electric longboard for fun, and I'm an entering freshman in college so this could be a cool way to get around campus. 

So like I said, I've been reading and researching, and I compiled this spreadsheet with the potential parts for my new E-Board from sellers that seem to be liked among the esk8 communities: 
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rAdDfoDBLXXPcLyFwsk4NGGoB_o_kkf0g2Eyqb2e5I0/edit?usp=sharing
I've included alternate parts/packages (not checkboxed) that I am considering if the selected ones don't work. I've left out the minor stuff like grip tape or connectors, because I want to focus on the main components. I also plan to make my own enclosure.

I'd greatly appreciate any kind of feedback that you all have on these parts. Are there any compatibility errors I'm missing? Is there a better & cheaper source for the parts I have selected? 

Thanks in advance!

@e.board_solutions
I know the LFP vs LiPo vs LI discussion has no clear answer, but I think it is time to include LFP cells as a serious alternative for LiPo and LI. They have reached a point where they have the same price, but are just way easier and safer to assemble and use than LiPo and LI. Yet, they are not seriously included in the guide. Maybe time to update?

I'm kinda new on this E-sk8 stuff. Is there any way to build an e-sk8 with direct wire controls. Is there a way to replace remote control with a potentiometer that's directly wired to the ESC, or rather just potentio-battery-motor.

Thanks
