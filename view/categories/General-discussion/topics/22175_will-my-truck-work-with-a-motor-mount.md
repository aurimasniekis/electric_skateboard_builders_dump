Hi I just bought a vanguard with Paris Trucks V2 50Â° Bustin 180mm (See picture).
However, I now have doubts I will be able to put a motor mount on it since it's rounded.
Any opinion ?

Look at @psychotiller ripba mounts, I put some on Paris 195s after I milled the hanger to fit.

If you choose ring adapter for paris trucks, it should work

Thank you guys. 
Fortunately, I was able to go back to the skate shop and switch to caliber II truck.
