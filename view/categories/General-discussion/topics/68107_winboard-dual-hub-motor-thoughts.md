Been in the market for some hub motors after my belt drive failed on me due to a short in one of the motors. As I'm based in EU, I have been looking locally and came across this pair of dual hubs from winboardskate.es 

They are waterproof and have 83mm replaceable PU, not sure the power as it says 1200W-1500W.  Has any had any experience with these?

Seems a steal at just €107 + €20 shipping!

I am also looking at the maytech hubs from electricboardsolutions.com which are a bit more at €200.

Any input would be greatly appreciated

If you want to stay cheap the best quality price of from meepo/wowgo/diyeboard ecc... Also the one from Winboard you are showing seems the sames. Didn't look into it in details. I have the Meepo style one, now you can have it with replaceable PU too. They are good, nice torque ecc... If yuu want more I move to these ones. They are the TB hubs now out of stocked (retail price over 350$ plus shipping :confused:) I organized a group buy for them and made a review. Check it out https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/review-and-eu-usa-group-buy-90mm-mad-hub-motors-75kv-or-130kv-dual-170-euro-1st-round-closed/62002?u=rey8801
At the end of the first post there are link to review and other info. They are really powerful. To me the best hubs after hummie's and probably raptor 2
