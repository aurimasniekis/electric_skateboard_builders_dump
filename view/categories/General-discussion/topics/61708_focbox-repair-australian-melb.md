[This was literally asked for yesterday](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/calling-an-australian-wizard/61609). Not calling you out about being a duplicated thread, just pointing out that there's a gap in the market here.

earlier I came across this guy selling spark switch , https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/anti-spark-switch-direct-fets-heatsink-metal-led-switch-is-included-100a/50912
then looked further on his website, found he does ESC repair too, but it's somewhere in europe since he prices everything in euro...though i don't think this is helping with anything in this thread ..

Hi,
thank you for mentioning me.
I am based in Slovakia, central Europe. Not sure what the shipping from Australia is to me but the return shipping is included in the 35â‚¬ (55AUD)

As far as local repair, I dont know about anyone officially repairing VESCs in Australia but surely there is someone on the forum who is able to do it for you in Australia. :)

Unfortunately this kind of repair just doesn't make any economic sense unless you get decent volume. The repairer would need a stock of parts and a thorough test rig, and even then its going to cost you more in shippingx2, parts, labour than just getting a new focbox. 

The only situation I can see this making sense is if there is a very common fault (like blown fet driver) that is very commonly fixed completely (nothing else blown) by simply replacing it. OR if there is a friendly person who will do it below cost.

As an example, If I were going to do this repair I would probably charge $50 to replace a FET driver and $10 per blown FET. then simple test. What percentage of that kind of repair is actually going to fix the FOCBOX? Troubleshoot at $150 an hour -> there goes the budget for the repair.
