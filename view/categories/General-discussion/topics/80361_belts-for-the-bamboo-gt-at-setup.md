Does anyone know where to get belts for the Bamboo GT AT configuration? I got a used Bamboo GT and all it came with were the tires, and extra tube, and extra street wheel setup belts. No AT belts. Ebay is a no go. Anyone know of anywhere that has them? Come to think of it, do I need anything else for the AT setup? It just now occurred to me there may be other parts missing too.

Get "360-5M-15" synchronous timing belts from vbeltsupply.com

WARNING: this is from memory.  Not totally sure about the first number.  Count the teeth on the belt and make sure it's 72 teeth...

edit: actually I read somewhere else that it's 425mm long, so that would be 85 teeth.  You'll have to count the teeth to know for sure.
