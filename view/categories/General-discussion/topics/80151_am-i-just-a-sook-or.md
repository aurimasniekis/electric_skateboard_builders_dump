Compared to the specs many of you guys have in your builds, my board might be considered a bit underwhelming. It is running 36/15, 85mm wheels, dual 6354s, 10s3p battery, focbox unity. But that combination is giving me more speed than I feel like I‚Äôll ever use, and more distance than I can comfortably ride it for. 

After a decentish ride (5km) the motors and Unity get warm, but not hot. I‚Äôm 100kg.

I get a calculated weighted top speed of 39km/h. If that‚Äôs the top speed I reckon the fastest I‚Äôve taken my diy board is 30km/h. I must cruise between 15 and 25 km/h

I‚Äôve been considering my next build and I‚Äôm thinking I could do a bigger battery... but for the life of me I can‚Äôt figure out what I‚Äôd do with the extra voltage or capacity.

Specifically the guys riding the dual 6374, 12s6p beasts... do you guys just ride for much longer distances, or do you really cruise around at like 65km/h? That‚Äôs crazy!

I think most builds are overkill.  I liked your build a lot and almost voted for it in the Best Builds thread.  Problem is when you have overkill like that, then it's really heavy and sucks taking it for a quick errand to the grocery store or whatnot. Most of the time I'm not going that far and need a board like yours.  Sometimes I go really far and need a huge heavy board, but not most rides.

It takes all kinds. No right or wrong way to sk8 as long as you're having fun and not endangering those around you. 
(Or giving the rest of the community a bad name) 

I have a dual 190kv 6374 12s4p at 16/36 fun as hell. Definitely fast and heavy. 
But my dual 5055 260kv 6s3 16/40 still gets tons on use. It rides in the 15-20mph range but its nice and light for trips to the store/work.

I agree with @b264 in that most boards are overkill. I have two 6354 motors on my board, I have them set to 42A max each, I can't hit full throttle because there is too much torque for me. So I could have smaller motors, but these ones are only at ~50 degrees after my 10km commute. Smaller motors would be hotter and stressed more.

Similarly with the battery. I have a 10s5p. I could probably get away with 10s3p, but having a larger battery means I don't stress it as much, it will last longer.

Oh yeah, for sure! Definitely not a criticism. If anything I‚Äôm a bit jealous.

I guess just because someone has a 12s4p+ battery, with dual 6374s (or bigger), that doesn‚Äôt mean they hoon around at full throttle for 50kms every day.

Presumably with that much _potential_ power, you could travel at exactly the same speed but everything just works less hard, meaning you use less battery. So basically you just go longer between charging, and as a result your battery life is greatly improved. Plus the life of all other components is probably improved also.

I ride quite a distance everyday, usually 15 miles a day so range is a must, and I cruise at around 50kmh and go up to 65kmh+ when I feel like I want to go zoom zoom.

In ny the riders here are no joke, you'll get left behind if you have less than 15 miles range and ride slow. Most of the guys here have at least 12s4ps, and some guys here have 12s10ps. Personally I have a 13s6p and dual 6474s.

That‚Äôs crazy man. NYC is obviously a hotspot of esk8 though.

I‚Äôm in New Zealand, and in a relatively small city at that. It‚Äôs probably 15km max from one side of the city to the other, and if I could find anyone to ride with they‚Äôd be on a stock evolve or meepo.

Still, I reckon my next build will be a larger board so maybe I‚Äôll develop a need for speed...

I think most of it depends on terrain.  I have a dual 6374 12s 4p and while the speed is fun its not the reason behind the power.  Where I live in QLD its hilly and being 110kg I need the torque to get me up the hills.  I use my board like a skiier uses a ski lift.

You *could*, but you *won't*, which means all the gains are for naught

Just a heavy tank board for all those short runs when a nice little kicktail would be better

Guilty as charged. I cruise at around 45 kph when the roads let me and do bursts of acceleration a lot when possible which is insanely powerful even from 20kph to max 53kph.
It‚Äôs just really torquey from zero to max. I love it. 
This does cut my range down a lot I think to 25-30 km on a 12s6p with 15-36 gearing on 97mm. 
I say I think for I only just completed my build and haven‚Äôt ridden a lot due to lack of dry weather. 

b254 is absolutely right though that it is really impractical for a quick grocery run which is why I should jump on the tayto groupbuy right now for a fourth build with 6355 and a 10s3p. 

My third build is already planned and almost paid for while my first build is up in pieces atm. 
I suppose I could just repurpose my first for that fourth hmm... but then it has to be carvon td and 12s2p (sanyo cells).

No matter how hard I try its so hard to keep more than 2 builds complete at any one time.  My first has been re-purposed 3 times and my third is still kicking, my 4th is my fav and the other 2 are skeletons in the shop.

That 10s is a killer though lol.

My first esk8 was a single belt 5055 liftboard with 6s4p. 16mph @ about 18miles on a charge. Got me where I needed to go and @ a reasonable speed. Built my first esk8, single belt 6374 12s1 lipo. If I wouldn't shit in my pants, it would do over 40mph. Had it to about 38mph running with traffic. Fuuuuuuun but shitting pants fun.

Well only those gains would be for naught in that case. 
I am really happy with my gains of high speed high torque and considerably more range than a less powerful build.

As long as your board fits your purpose all is good.
If somebody tell you different they should shut the f*** up.
It doesn‚Äôt matter if it‚Äôs a single drive campus cruiser or a quad speed demon.
For some people cruising around 30km/h is the way to go, for others they need to show how big there balls... everybody how they want.
I respect every diy build because people take the time to build things by there own. 
Sometimes it takes even more time and research and building and research if you low on budget and doing a small cruiser than just to order all high end newest stuff you can get and just put that together....

Your board is great.
I have a powerful board that I also use to commute (20km roundtrip).

https://metr.at/r/toRe7?zoom_start=2900&zoom_end=4672

As you can see I regularly go over 40km/h, at times I may stay at 50km/h for close to a minute.
However, my board is heavy and I only go that fast when wearing full gear ( full face helmet, knee pads, motorcycle jacket, slide gloves).
When I just want to run an errand and don't want to gear up (still wear my helmet though) I ride a lot slower.
I am actually thinking about building a small light board to use in these situations as my other boards are monsters. This is why I asked you about the weight in your build thread.
Also keep in mind that a short agile board will be less stable than a longer one built for high speed.
