Went riding in the snow/rain today, thinking my 206 box would be waterproof with all the hot glue covering the holes for the VESC wires and volt meter (drilled a square into the lid/top where it is pressed into). 

During the ride, my board shut down and I had to walk home. Opened my 206 box and saw water & mud, which seeped into the box and the VESCs. Dried everything up & cleaned all the components. Everything working again (the luck!)


Hot glue appears to be doing a very poor job at sealing gaps and holes in general. Has anyone had success with hot glue for water proofing? Anything else that might be better?

Also contemplating conformal coating my dual Focboxes, but I am uncertain if they would still fit inside the enclosure. I know I would have to tape off the direct fets to ensure they are cooled properly via the housing.

Any help/hints/suggestions welcome.

Use silicon caulk, it's what they use on Windows and doors, and I use it for my board.

There is also cable clams that you can slide over the wires and attach them to your enclosure.

These would probably work best

Amazing stuff but when you have to remove it for maintenance of such it's more expensive sugru time

Thats why I sugru'd extender cables so I can still replace every bit and piece and it stays modular.
