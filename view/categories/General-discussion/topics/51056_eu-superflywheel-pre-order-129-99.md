Hey guys

Since the 107mm superfly, is a wanted wheel but very expensive in Europe, I will buy a bunch of them and import them from USA to Belgium (EU) :slight_smile:

I will do a prÃ©-order for 129.99euro's, and deliver them around mid April (the new black wheels) and Begin May for the lime wheels :slight_smile:

If you want more than 1 set, you can contact me and we can see for a small discount ;)

They should remove that superman logo and write Electric Flywheel on them, like their 1st batch of 107â€˜s, just because i like it more

Maybe a pre-design, if not maybe an agreement with Warner Bros, if not luckily for ABEC11 it can be removed easility enough,would be a shame to see them destroyed by a court order

Shiping on orders over 150 is free, shipping in Europe starts at 6,5 and goes up to 16,5.
France is 10.5 (up to 30kg)

Good to know ! I prefer to pay for stuff, not for shipping ;)

So I can pre-order the wheels AND others stuff in the same cart to have free shipping (to France) if the total is over 150 â‚¬  (and if the weight is less than 30 Kg)?

Folks this offer is a shit way for a vendor to make any money whatsoever, in retail terms it's called a loss-leader; it's an excellent way to establish a customer base with a desirable product that is way too expensive for the diy builder crowd at RRP.

I hope people don't buy to resell, unless it's on a complete

Hats off to you FrÃ©dÃ©ric

Hi guys

Just an update on the black flywheels, ABEC11 had some production delays. If everything goes well (this never happens :face_with_raised_eyebrow: ) I will be able to ship to you guys at the end of next week.

If you can't wait anylonger I can get you the lime wheels faster. :+1:

Grtz
Frederic
