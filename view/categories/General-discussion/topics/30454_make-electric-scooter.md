Hey guys,

So I planned to make a dual motor build, and I got two 6355 motors and a 12s4p from Torque Boards. One part arrived late, so I went ahead and make my board with one motor. I really like it this way, because I'm very light, and I don't think I need to power of two motors (It'll weigh down the board even more too). 

Do you guys really think it's worth it to push to dual motors? If not is it possible to make something like an electric scooter in the same way?

Thanks!
