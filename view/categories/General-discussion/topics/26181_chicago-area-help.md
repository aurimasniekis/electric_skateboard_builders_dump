I'm from the Chicago suburbs and looking for a little help... people from around here, can we talk a little so I could ask some questions and maybe have a meetup? Talking or even a hands on would be so helpful for me! Thx

Hiya I'm in the oak Park area and been riding for over a year around oak Park and the edge of Chicago there's also a thread for Chicago Meetup with some guys from Hinsdale and Orland Park possibly meeting in Grant Park in the coming weekends my guess is with the taste of Chicago and Independence day stuff we might need to push it back or meet somewhere other than Grant Park but that's all I've heard so far.  Hit me up if you have questions though.
