Hey Folks. If you live in the Bay Area, I'm giving away a beat-up Metro-board.

It was fun when it was new, but I ran intro problems with the belts and pulleys. As far as I know the motor, battery, controller, wheels, trucks, bearings and deck are in fine shape, but it will won't run right. Maybe you want to fix it up, maybe you want it for parts? Either way, she needs  anew home!

If you're interested, you've gotta come pick it up in San Francisco!

Not to side track the thread, seeing that the board is already taken, I to had a metro board, up until now the use there own proprietary esc. And IR remote. A real headache.
I ended up gutting it all out and installed a vesc with a gtb2 remote. Than it was a nice board.. just saying üòä

I have 2 with radio remotes, they use the mini remote just like a lot of us here use.  What do you mean up until now?  Do they have a new ESC?

metroboard does not use VESCs.

the only prebuilt boards with VESCs are Raptor 2, Arc Boards, Pulse Boards, Carvon.

Jed uses a custom ESC. Not a VESC. Vedder did not design it. Therefore, not Vedder's Electronic Speed Controller.. Maybe JESC? :P

OMG you just gave away a metroboard? The quality of people around here is out of this world! Congrats for being such a generous being!

If I lived around you, I'll pick it up fix it and give it away back to you as a gift, you man deserve it.

If it's not the vesc then it's the remote or the BMS, very easy things to fix, he said the pullies are have long so√±√© issues as well, nothing a new set of pullies and belt can't fix.

Sometimes you can't, Metroboard double-welds the motor mounts so no parting out there, it's the whole thing or nothing LoLz
