Just thought I’d share this AliExpress find....

I found a cool little headtorch that will fit beautifully under the nose of most boards.

The holder is easily modified and the torch is seriously bright for its size. 

Here’s the torch.... I’ll do the board fitting tomorrow and add more images.

It’s hard to show in an image how bright they are but I’d say its over 1000 lumens with a nice beam pattern...

Here’s my bracket... cnc’d Out of Delrin clicks into and out of the drop through cutout... very satisfying clunk.

 This is promising, might purchase a couple. Shredlights are starting to feel a bit too dim for me...

Wonder if i can put a better cell in there like a 30Q or another 18650 with more capacity.

I’m thinking of adding this to the shredlights.... more visibility can never be a bad thing

Found a little more info... Yes you can switch the battery out but apparently you can also charge the lights themselves?!? Unluess thats just to charge the 18650...Not too sure. 2300 lumens max are claimed when using both lights and an 18650. My italian isnt all that great...

I think 2300 lumens is a bit of manufacturer exaggeration but they are very bright. The light has a charge port and it will charge whichever 18650 you put into it. You can see the port on the first post... port accessed by rotating the button end bezel. It seems to be a well thought out little light.....

Could that bracket be 3D printed? Any files? It looks like it's for the Hummie deck right?

It’s for the hummie deck... I cut the parts with 2d vectors on a cnc router but they could be easily turned into 3D print files. I’ll post them next week sometime.

So @amazingdave what do you think of the light so far? Should i buy a few of these and replace my shredlights?

Looks solid, kinda too big for my taste, but if it gives enough light, I think I could accept the size.

 What do you guys use for the backlight?

It’s as small as it can be with an 18650 and no overheating issues imho...

I’m using a cheapo usb rechargeable bike light from amazon. It only lasts about 1.5 hours but is very bright. 

I generally have a light on my helmet as well  for high level visibility and seeing the terrain. ( lights at board level just cast shadows which can hide a pothole or tree root).

@Linny I’ve not seen shredlights in the flesh for a direct comparison but I am quite taken by this... it’s not a lot to spend for the sake of science.

That's all you had to say. I'll buy one and try it out first, and if its good i'll get more. Now to think of ways to mount it to a board or truck..

You could just screw the included plastic clip to your board for a quick fix or put the elastic head strap around the nose of your board.

I asked @ervinelin for a favor to design a mount that mounts similar like the single shredlight mount, and he made a really nice model that's compatible with Caliber II trucks. Not sure if other baseplates would work but it should be fine as long as there is enough clearance from the pivot cup.

Looking good! One thing about bolts that long is that they are likely to bend a bit from braking/acceleration, it might be better to reduce the thickness of the lower prong of the design or make the nut flush into it to reduce bolt length

Not sure of the grade bolts in this pic but stainless is not nearly as strong as a graded 12.9 steel bolt

What are the chances of sharing the stl files for the holder?

Nice!  If anyone wants the 2d vectors that I used to mill mine let me know.... I need to get my head around 3D cadding...

In fact these were M4 8.8 bolts... Let's just say I switched to M5 10.9-12.9 bolts straight after that.

Add a nut trap so nuts can be added in their usual location and a second nut on top just for the light mount.
