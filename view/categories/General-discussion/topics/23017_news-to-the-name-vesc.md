Hello everyone!
Use of the name Vesc is no longer allowed!
But this is only a public opinion from me!
I was informed by Trampa that I can not use the name Vesc since it is a registered (TM) brand since last year.
I will comply with this call and will no longer name VESC on the
Of my products sold.
Also for this reason there is no longer the VESC Repair!
I was also informed that all previous providers the VESC 4.12
Produced or sold (sold) this would no longer be allowed in the future.
I would have to name the Vesc 4.12 differently in the future if I would like to continue producing and selling it.
What I decided to make the Vesc 4.12 different and make more compact.
Provided with a protective housing as a prototype, test version just so.
Is not available and has not been sold yet.
Accordingly, I wanted to rename the new design on Vesk8.
This has now me Trampa forbidden, as it confusion
Through product similarity and phonetics, between Vesc and Vesk8.
For this reason, we will not produce the Vesc 4.12 under the name of Vesc.
Let's say esk8 controller sounds better and deliver accordingly to our customers.
But the quality continues to exist and we can
Continue to assure that the ESK8 controller,
Made in Germany.
Best regards Attila

So .... only Trampa can make a VESC now  - every other seller will have to rename their products! Is Enertion allowed to sell the VESC-X? How/ why is there a trademark on an open-source project?

Your complain sounds to me like:
"I hate that douche cop who stopped me from withdrawing money with a credit card I found on the ground".

Accept that. The cop(trampa) is bringing back the card to the owner(vedder).

Dont confuse Trademark and CC license.
You are still allowed to make and sell the vesc. You just cant call it vesc free of charge.
Instead of saying thanks for the license, @esk8 is saying f**k for the trademark.

I don't agree that esk8 is saying that (there are so many VESCs that are called VESC despite the trademark), but now understand what Trampa has done. I am still confused though what sellers are now meant to sell their VESCs as! Could you shed some light on this @trampa (sellers are allowed to make the VESC and then have to somehow advertise their motor controller is a VESC without including the word VESC)? 

BTW @Trampa Thank you for helping Benjamin Vedder continue the VESC project.

If VESC is a trademark, anyone know in what country(ies) it's registered?  Who owns the trademark? Word TM or Figure, or both...

US search from uspto [shows no results](https://search.uspto.gov/search?query=vesc&op=Search&affiliate=web-sdmg-uspto.gov)

I don't see it in the EU either.  [Search results](https://euipo.europa.eu/eSearch/#basic/1+1+1+1/50+50+50+50/VESC).

Maybe a Brexit thing?

We always have produced the original Vesc
with original parts.
Just as Benjamin wanted it.
We also always get from each Vesc
we have sold a donation made to benjamin.
We do not say f ** k to Vesc
We would love to sell the vesc as vesc
And also so produce.
But Trampa has told us that is no more.
We must give another name for the vesc
If we want to resell.
Trampa has forbidden us the name vesc to use
no more.

_Im not sure if most people are aware of this fact...._ 

Benjamin Vedder didn't actually create the name "VESC" 

In fact, it was the ESK8 community who created the name "VESC"
It was also the ESK8 community that made this project VERY popular.

Quick History lesson;

Firstly, if it wasn't for @ austindavid & @torqueboards for originally publishing info about benjamins ESC none of us esk8ers would have Known about it.

The name itself was coined by @ Beto_pty who originally made the name Vedders Endless Sphere Controller: https://endless-sphere.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=35&t=63540&start=125#p957046

If it wasn't for @ jacobbloy who was the first person to organize a group buy (BV also did some too).

And @ chaka for reworking the hardware to improve reliability

And for everyone else (users) for testing & providing feedback. Without the community the VESC just wouldnt be a "thing"

I suppose it's time to come up with another name? 

Unfortunately this means the "VESC" name will likely be forgotten as new stuff comes in.

Many thanks @onloop for explaining the history. My problem with BV registering the name is that now everyone will have to use a different name to refer to it --> the VESC name will be forgotten --> the project will be renamed (it is an unbelievably good motor controller) --> the cycle will repeat and make it confusing for new members of the ESK8 community (they will have to learn that VESC = Esk8 controller = ........). Why is enertion fine with VESC-X when VESK8 is not fine - VESC-X even has VESC in it/ has there been an agreement with BV to allow the VESC-X to be branded with VESC in the name?

Names off the top of my head if the name VESC is going to be banned for everyone but @Trampa: 
BVESC (Benjamin Vedder's Electric Speed Controller)? SESC (Skateboard Electric Speed Controller)? UESC (Ultimate Electric Speed Controller)?

Hi everyone, please go to www.vesc-project.com and click on "trademark policy" at the bottom of the page. A lot is explained there. Every major OS-Project has the TM to enable customers to identify the original source. It's the only way to prevent things going funny and preventing e.g. bad code being published under the same name. If you want to use e.g. Firefox, you want to be sure its the Mozilla distribution and not some third party software simply being branded the same, looking the same, maybe even containing malware or spyware or just being of a different quality. The only way to assure that, is having the TM and forcing others to use their Brand for distribution. You can compile your own browser, using the e.g. Mozilla code but you have to use your own brand and stand in for the quality you make with your own brand.  It's imperative for the VESC-Project to assure that it can be identified as the original source for many reasons. Fair use of the TM is explicitly allowed! So please read carefully through the TM policies and assure to conform. The TM is registered in Europe! Many other counties will follow soon.
Many OS-Projects had trouble in the past and no ones wants Benjamin to go through the same troubles, believe me. Owning the TM is the only way to assure that trouble is out of the way.

If you make something, stand in for what you make with your own name or brand. 
"xyz controller, based upon the OS Vesc-Project", followed by a TM notice and a link is totally fine! No one wants to prevent anyone from selling hardware. Just create your own distinctive brand - in your very own interest. 

Frank

Thank you very much Frank for the clarification - now the idea of trademarking VESC, Vedder and BLDC tool makes more sense and I am sure will be great for the project! I really like that there are examples at the bottom of (http://www.vesc-project.com/trademark_policies_page) - it is very useful. However, I still :( have some questions (sorry)!

I still don't understand though, why esk8.de is not allowed to sell VESCs - they use the same hardware and firmware and state what VESC version they are selling. They also seem to be a prominent, reliable esk8 seller - what does a seller of VESCs need to do to make it reliable enough to classify describing their product as x version of the VESC ...[quote="trampa, post:20, topic:23017"]
Fair use
[/quote]
... of the trademark VESC®.

Also, confusingly "a trademark should never be used as a verb or noun" - goes against [quote="trampa, post:20, topic:23017"]
Fair use of the TM
[/quote]


Finally, given this sentence ("A trademark notice should be used on the most prominent and/or first appearance of each mark of Mr. Vedder, and a trademark notice should not be changed. ") if at each use of VESC a TM mark is written (and no other copyrighted phrases/words are written on the circuit board) can other RELIABLE (approved by Vedder/ @trampa) sellers sell VESCs. Would renaming VESC 4.12 to VESC® 4.12 make it fine for esk8.de - trying to find an example that many sellers can implement e.g. VESC®-X etc. Obviously, in the description, there would have to be some text to make clear that though even if the design used was Vedder's, all inconsistencies in production are the fault of the seller.

Apologies for the long reply, all quotes I have given are from (http://www.vesc-project.com/trademark_policies_page) or @trampa's previous reply.

Hi, so far Benjamin didn't enforce the TM, which will change soon. You can't use VESC on a product, nor to endorse or promote your products (hardware/software). You can't use it for ads, SEO etc. 

Benjamin will publish a notification soon. In your very own interest: Stop using the Brand and and start to build up your own Brand. Promoting or selling products towards/in Europe is not legal, using the Vedder Marks! 

It's for the good of the Project and the customers. There is a reason why most OS-Projects have TMs and enforce them. It's the only way to assure fair play and keep people or companies with bad attitudes and intentions away.

Not so sure about not letting certified sellers (by you and Vedder) sell VESCs, but I do agree that having official software will be good in the long run. I assume Enertion is fine for the moment because it is in Australia. Will that change (seems rather odd that if a company is based elsewhere it can just bypass a trademark)? Will you also be applying for trademark in the UK (Brexit)?

Is there not a worry that some companies do not care about trademarks on electronics - there are fakes for most hardware (e.g. arduinos) and as soon as that company is 'stopped' it is reopened under a different name. 

I agree with @onloop - how does that work!? Vedder doesn't sell VESCs himself ... right ... so if only he has the right to market/ make them - that makes the project a R&D project that can't make it to market because of legislature?!

Wondering since the TM is registered under Vedder's name, if he is licensing it to Trampa.  I don't mind Vedder making some money based on his efforts and know-how, if that's the case. Prefer that he owns the TM rather than a Trademark Troll owning it. Licensing can be simpler way to make some $$ compared to manufacturing.

@trampa Trademark enforcement, in this instance is absolutely NOT for the good if the customer, it's to protect profit. 

From my point of view you are protecting profits for a products that we as a community at least partially developed.  Frankly, without @onloop, @torqueboards, @oriol360, @okp and their commercial successes with the VESC then Mr. Vedder would have created a product with no outlet and no value.  It seems that now you are stepping in and taking advantage of that product growth and potential growth by way of lawyers not innovation.

I've seen this hundreds of times.  It systematic of what wrong with the "profitablity" mindset in this era.  Anything you can do legally must be ok.  Nevermind that the customer is given less choice and higher prices, that people that are willing to risk time and capital to grow a product now are not willing, nevermind that I've spent 1200 bucks on VESCs alone in the last 6 months but I can call em VESC's anymore.

@trampa

I am a technician not a lowyer, but if I understand your comment and the trademark policy on the homepage correctly @esk8 isnt that wrong with his VESK8:

on the policy page the secound example is

> Correct: "your product name" based upon "Mr.Vedder mark"
> example: XYZ Controller based upon the VESC® Open Source Project

And this is the picture that @esk8 posted in  [**no words...just pictures delete words use pm**](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/no-words-just-pictures-delete-words-use-pm/2992/1579) modified by myself to show only one VESK8

In my opinion the only thing that is missing is the (R) after the VESC

It seems to me that if you are giving credit where legal obligation is due but nearly completely changing the name then as obligated then you should be fine. If any profiteers want to litigate and submit a proper cease and desist then the onerous falls on them. Without such proper documentation its just barking. I think the final word has to come from BV himself anyways. As of yet it is just one company pounding their chest and announcing that they won. What has BV said on the matter?

The Policy states: You can't use VESC on a product legally, nor use it endorse or advertize products in the scope of the TM. 

You can't use Vesk instead of Vesc or Wezk or Fesk. Phonetic similarity is not allows by TM legislation. 
When you sell or endorse, advertise towards Europe or sit in Europe, don't use VESC or any other project related TM.

And yes, TM trolls are out there and they try to hijack Projects and sue projects. Owning the TM is essential for a project. Anyone believing you could run a OS project without the ownership of the TM is dead wrong. Trouble will come up sooner than later. This world is full of gready folks trying to ride on everyone's back and having zero ethos. 
If you don't protect a project against that, its almost certain that some folk will try to take over the Brand. You can fight that if you have plenty of cash and time but it will take years and years and tenth of thousands of dollars and nerves. So basically a project being hijacked has no other chance than a full restart. Since the code is OS, hijackers can take over the project with ease.

I can't believe that some people think its  bad that Benjamin and the Project is now protected against attacks. You will find plenty of stories where OS projects have been hijacked. If a project gets successful, its almost certain that someone will grab the TM! I'm already sick of domain-grabbing. TM grabbing is so much more worse! 

So anyone saying its a bad thing that VESC is a TM, owned by BV, is basically wanting the Project to go through all that mess and wants some prick to own the TM instead of BV. GREAT idea! Yes, its for the good of the Project, believe me!!!

I agree that BV having the trademark is the best possible person to have the trade mark. The issue is why can you sell VESC's on your website and everyone else has to take it down + why can't VESCs continue to be marketed as VESCS (and BV justs protects other pricks from stealing the TM and using it to a competitive advantage that destroys the VESC).

Because we make - in cooperation with BV - the original Hardware. Benjamin can control the quality and has gains. 

After Beta testing, the Software will be published and a reference hardware design.
Anyone can start to design and make Hardware and Software! You can set your own price! 

Unfortunately a TM can't be allowed to be used randomly, because its against the nature of a TM (serving the purpose that customers can identify the original source).
Letting everyone use the TM and then randomly pick on someone is not fair and legally not possible.

If you do something, stand in with your own good name! Build up a Brand with a good reputation and offset your products from your competitions. Its in your very own interest to do that anyway. 

Have you ever bought a Windows Computer other than from Microsoft? Probably not. You probably bought a Lenovo, Acer, whatever, running Windows. 

In future you buy a Xyz ESC capable of running VESC-Tool since the VESC-Project is 95% software related.

Its Sundays folks, I have two kids jumping around and wanting my attention.

Things are the way they are for a good reason. Benjamin and I spent a lot of time on making decisions! It's the only way to handle things if you look closer at the matter. We can't change legislation!

Unless they can prove otherwise it appears that Trampa has brokered an exclusive deal with Vedder. They aren't openly saying this, they are acting the part of "defender and champion" of Vedder's intellectual property to deflect from the obvious optics of the situation. The optics aren't good, not good at all. I think we would all like to see a statement from Benjamin himself. I think that the community that supported and embraced him and his work deserves at least that.

@Lambjr088 TM stands for trademark. Read the whole thread (especially @onloop's reply) to understand the VESC's history. 

I agree that either @trampa should explain why he is exempt from Vedder's trademarks or Vedder should explain what he himself wants to do with HIS trademarks. I fully understand why Vedder took out the trademarks but think that he should definitely license reliable sellers (fee per VESC sold) to sell his amazing open source product - no shipping cost to different continents if suppliers in each continent. 

Thank you for explaining about the TM @trampa, enjoy your Sunday with your kids. I don't understand your reference to Microsoft nor how other sellers like 'esk8.de' are not using the original hardware. The software of the VESC is vital but as you said in another thread, the VESC 4 doesn't have the capability to run the latest software - the hardware has also changed hugely. I would also like to point out that the hardware is what others are selling and those that sell the original hardware should be allowed to do so and call it a VESC. However, I do agree that other sellers selling ESCs that are NOT designed by Vedder but still running VESC firmware (e.g. VESC-X) should not have the permission to have VESC in the name. These ESCs should, as you have said, have written in the description 'based on the VESC designed by Benjamin Vedder'. 

As for:[quote="trampa, post:37, topic:23017"]
We can't change legislation!
[/quote]
Vedder can keep the trademark but only use it legally against VESCs that do not use his original hardware. Vedder has not used his trademark for a year (correct me if I am wrong) and hence does not NEED to use it. 

The esk8 community seems to be full of people who want to do make their market better, but using this trademark wrongly seems to be stifling this open-source, make the community better ethos.

Nobody is arguing that Vedder needs to be able to make a living on his design. Nobody is arguing that business is business. 

The issue here is that the way in which we are discovering this transition is vague and non-transparent. The people that championed this project when it was nothing deserve some clarity.

Don't play this community as fools. All this spin is just too much, we deal with it in our daily lives and awful political climate. Esk8 is our escape from all that spin and rubbish. Until now it was our escape from it all.

If you want to repair the damaged optics of this situation please get out in front of it and be honest. The dancing around the truth is painfully obvious. I was planning my next build around a Trampa platform... I'm not sure now. Its like when Metallica went after people downloading songs. People stopped buying their music after that. Again, bad optics.

You know full well that the vesc name has become synonymous with the tech. Its like calling all tissue Kleenex. Legally you may rule the day, but it's hearts and minds that must be won in order to truly win. The ball is clearly in your court. We'll just have to wait and watch what you do next.

@onloop You are right and Trampa may use only the name VESC alone. So they throw everyone out of the business, who has sold VESC so far.
This is the thanks to all the people who participated in the VESC.
So it is certain that TRAMPA can make a lot of money.
I bought many things at ESK.DE and am still with today
Very satisfied and it holds unlike Yuneec and Evolve.
No matter what name esk8.de used for the VESC, I will go on with them shopping. I have now 5 boards with which I drive only with the VESC of esk8.de and if you protect this also a little protects the VESC forever.

We were always trying
The original Vedder Vesc
With original parts and quality BV accordingly
We were not on profit but on quality
We have earned money yes
But we have not become rich thereby
We have always donated money to Benjamin
Maybe not as much as others
But we have supported him
We also have his fellow student Linus
Two stroke engines, wheels and Vesc
For his diploma thesis
We were also the ones who did the Vesc Repair in
Europe
Unfortunately set by Trampa.
But since Trampa has certainly already replaced
This is also very profitable!
We tried to produce the Vesc for the community cheaply
In the beginning it was not easy
But we have a manufacturer in Germany who found us
Cheaper Vesc has produced
We have the same given back to the community and our prices
Also lowered.
I do not mind that Benjamin's money for his
Excellent work gets.
He should, too
I think that's great
But perhaps you should find a compromise
Where one says, those who have honored his work in honor
Those should be allowed nevertheless the vesc 4.12 further than such
To sell

I disagree with @esk8 my opinion is that this choice will be detrimental to the VESC project. There are two ways this could go: 
1. There is a huge community poll to decide on what to do next --> upsides of both have to be shown as well as downsides to show Vedder communities opinion and arguments. My honest opinion is that the high price for the VESC will reduce sales, and thereby donations to the project and result in lots of closed source projects. As most companies in eboarding are currently small and do not have the money to run their own esc R&D lab, improvements to the VESC will stop as no one will develop it further. This will make the whole hobby of eboarding less interesting with less developments. If the community wants to, it could enforce a policy that all sellers using VESC in their product name have to donate some percentage of their profit each month to Vedder (like a royalty).
2. Vedder releases his statement that he only wants @trampa to sell his VESC under its rightful name. All the sellers ignore this, knowing that if they are all sued, no one will use his product as this is a community that helped make him money out of his product. Vedder obviously would not want to kill off a product that is great and he has spent so long developing so will not sue the companies (as he has been doing for the past year).

@trampa can't get quoting to work in my phone, so forgive me if I paraphrase.

Youu said BV has issued a statement just give it time.  That's not the issue, the issue is that you have licensed away the right to us a name that the community developed.  

Next you said  if you do something stand on your own good name.  Really?  Maybe you wanna read that again...

I want to know how this protects the consumer because the only benefit I see to this legal exersize is for your company to be able to say VESC and not let others.  That has to be promoted by profitablity for Trampa.  

I mean, it's all good, but this at the very least seems like your bullying the little guy.  I'll just keep buying my 'not Trampa speed controllers' from someone else.

Good luck with this move, I sincerely hope you can you justify this course of action because if you cannot you have essentially alienated 90% of the builders and all of the manufacturers.  Not to mention by doubling the price you have cost BV money, a lot less will be sold.

I would have expected this it of a US Corporation, not someone  who had been in the game as a hobbyist and a builder.  We remember shit like this.

I get that BV wants to trademark the VESC brand and think it is not that big of a deal as long as the actual project is still open source (actually I would not even be mad if he would make it closed source - it is his time and his project and he can do whatever he wants with it). There were no actual contributions of the community to him besides some donations so he is not obligated in any way to publish any of this.

What bugs me though is that apparently only BV himself holds the trademark but trampa is the one going around trying to enforce it? That seems weird. Also there are probably bigger fish that should be targeted like Maytech (with actual inferior VESCs than the established brands) - why go for a little guy like esk8 that has always stood behind BV.

In terms of "likeability" Trampa has lost some points in my book.

I keep trying to see it from @trampa's viewpoint (that it is good for the community), but I can't. It is forcing vendors to not use Vedder's amazing trademarked esc (neatly avoided saying it), copy/ improve it slighly and sell under a different name. Some profiteering vendors will use the excuse that because their product hasn't got the slightest hint of Vedder's name in it, they don't have to support Vedder's open source project. This could be disastrous, BUT I respect @trampa helping Vedder with his huge workload and for leaving the project open-source (he could have advised Vedder to make it closed source)! For this reason and the fact that legally he is the only person with rights (I think from what he has said) to sell the esc under its old name, his should be called the VESC and the name for other vendors is to be decided. 

Basically, don't be rude (even if you don't like what @trampa has done) as from what I have read it was bound to happen and @trampa has been kind to vendors (giving them other options)

So let me summarize this. VESC is trademarked in Europe and not the United States, China, and Australia at the moment. That means VESC can still be used in United States, China, and Australia until registered. Because of the language said, the use of BESC, V3SC, BESK, V3SK, BESK8, V3SK8 is still up for grabs coming close to VESC spelling. If in Europe, unless you are Trampa, you must reference all VESC as compatible with software or under your own brand. 

After I make this post. Good luck to anyone trying to get a VESC trademark in China because their rules do not apply to roman letters and you have to work with someone in China to get your trademark in China as my Chinese friend has told me.

Benjamin has been easily the most generous person to the community, the Chinese manufacturers don't give jack shit to him, but I sure hope that people like @onloop @torqueboards @okp @oriol360 and @esk8 donated something to him.

I don't know a lot about trademarks, but surely there is another way to release it open source to everyone to sell under the name VESC, and guaranteeing some cash flow to Vedder

I wonder what percentage of cash flow came from the VESC, if any seller would be willing to share that information that would be interesting.

So can I just confirm that it can be sold, but not under the name that this community BUILT TOGETHER?

Honestly, sorry if this comes across as really rude, but I believe in it and it's MY opinion.

I think there might be a small misunderstanding here. Ben just wants everyone who releases a custom design to market it with a different name while also giving credit for the source in the description of the product. The original v4.12 is still and will always be a VESC. 

I think it is important that Vedder protect what designs bare his moniker. He just wants everyone who brings new designs based on the original to "run their own race".  

All of this was told to me by Vedder himself.

The Vesc-Project has reached a point where it needed to take the hurdle to get a bit more professional. 

Lets compare such a OS-Project to a house. 
Its always wise to build upon strong foundations. Otherwise you put a lot of effort into building the house and finally you have to realize that anyone could crush your building, simply pulling out a brick in the cellar. So its inevitable to set up the foundations strong enough befor erecting a new building.

The amount of work Benjamin put in there is astronomic. He needs the TM, so that all the effort is protected against guys with bad intentions. Just google OS and Trademark.

Benjamin has a TM policy online and many things are explained there. Help him and stick to the TM policies. There is lots of thought in there! BTW, its pretty much like the Linux TM policy, so its probably quite a fair deal and not phony work of phony lawyers. 

Benjamin has published a statement already but maybe it needs clarification. 

Since Benjamin can't do everything (a day has only 24 hours), the only way to put out an official quality checked Hardware release is teaming up with someone like us, who put tons of effort and cash in the VESC 6 environment.
We can handle the manufacturing, customer support and shipping, Benjamin can't do that, due to the lack of infrastructure and time. He also couldn't be the quality control center for world wide Vesc production without hiring staff, no one would pay for.
Since he can control the official release VESCs quality, has gains from it in future + its an official release, its called VESC. The official software release is called VESC-Tool.

I helped him to setup the project in a sustainable and professional way. A licensing model is due to be released. If you wish to show your support there will be a way to do it, no worries. 

Software and reference Hardware will be OS, but the TM will be in Benjamins hands for given reasons. 
Benjamin doesn't want anyone to be able to call the Hardware like the official project titel.
He wants his own work, quality approved by himself to have the VESC-Label on.

Don't you guys think its fair enough that he shares the code and hardware designs? Why should he also share the TM. No major OS-Project does that! Otherwise the TM would be useless and not serving its purpose (serving the customer to identify the original quality source). 

Why is it so hard to accept that making hardware you should use your own Brand and stand in for the quality you make with your own Brand. Poorly made VESCs, using the VESC brand, would have a negative impact on the entire project.
We have seen such things happening already. 

Everyone wanting to contribute in a positive way is invited to do so and will be granted benefits under an official license model.
That will help you to advertise your products and Benjamin to build up a future for the project. That is the most important I think. Without fundings no future. We thought a lot about the best way to assure a good future. 
Relax, everything will be fine in the end, no bad intentions.

I couldn't agree more with that... As I said in other post on this forum I'm not against a TradeMark... but like everyone else on this forum I just don't get **WHY ARE YOU THE ONE ENFORCING BENJAMIN VEDDER TRADEMARK** , if you aren't a part of this trademark ?

okey back to topic

@trampa: 
if I understood everything correctly it is allowed to design / remix the current and upcomming open source vesc design, but you have to use your own name, and you have to reffer to benjamin.
Then everything is Okey till your name is to close to the "original" Vesc name (Phonetic or however it is called).
That way you do not have to pay / donate / ... anything to Benjamin.

But If you want to use the name VESC you have to get a licence from you (Trampa) or Benjamin. Which one?
Then you are allowed to ues the name and sell "original" VESCs but you have to purchase it form you (Trampa) or how do you confirm that they are "good" enough for Benjamins specs? You wrote already that Benjamin is not able to do that or to hire people around the globe to do that?!
That way you (Trampa) donate to Benjamin, but you (Trampa) are the only company that produces VESCs?

would be nice if you could clear up my thoughts

Because i'm sure he reaps the reward as the sole distributor. This "Hey guys i'm still your friend" bullshit is ridiculous. Many guys in this group have added an invaluable amount of time and resources to improve a product that is now being taken away from them. I genuinely hope everyone can band together under a new esc name and take the business away from Trampa. I was a few days away from ordering a MTB setup from them but will certainly be pulling the plug on that idea. This is a pretty common occurrence where one person gets greedy and screws his "friends". I just didn't expect it from someone like Trampa.

My point of view: 
The trademark is something he could and maybe should have done  before, there are many vescs that don't respect his guide lines and still keep that name. If we don't want to destroy a product we need it to be protected in some way (Chinese will still steal, but there's not much we can do. At least they will be the only one selling crap stuff with vedder's name on it) 
I understand the name thing, "you can only sell as vesc if you pass quality control and/or pay fees for the name", that's understandable. 
What's not clear is: 
Why trampa? They haven't been the ones most involved with the vesc industry, except for the development lately. They were only in the  mountainboard market, not electronics, not vescs sellers nor innovators nor even the ones the vesc was made for, since it couldn't deliver the power needed for mountainboards (that may be the reason why they wanted to develop it further, to be able to use it) 
What I mean is, there's people like chaka, but also enertion with vesc x or torqueboards,  that helped the vesc become what it is, developing it themselves to improve what vedder had designed. They don't sell crap with vedder's name on it. They take vedder's guidelines and improve them (improvements that he takes in the next official versions), plus they make an absurd amount of advertising for him, while still donating for his work. 
These people should be allowed to keep selling what they helped to create. 

Another thing is: in what way vesk8 sounds too similar to vesc? Are you kidding me? The "e" doesn't even have the same sound when pronounced. Basically, nobody can ever make an esc with the word esc inside? Did vedder invent that word? This is bullshit

Are we enforcing something? I just gave a hint to to esk8.de that VESK8 is problematic and clashing with the TM and asked him kindly to choose another name, because its not a good idea to choose a name that is phonetically identical and would not withstand any legislation. A non informed regular person can't figure out the difference between VESK and VESC, Vesk8 or VESC 8. The closer your product, the further apart your name should be! If you like to sell Burgers, VESC might be fine for that. 

Enforcing means forcing someone to comply, through the use of legal steps, not dropping someone a notification of potential problems. Worst thing thing you can do is build up your Branding on weak foundations, so I send out a clarification mail to prevent a clashing and uncomfortable situation.

Shit storms at somehow fascinating. 
My opinion about shit storms is: They are shit. Its always easy to pick on someone and start to beat him up because something is not 100% the way you like it.

I would like to know why people don't go after a random OS-Project - because they have a TM policy installed. This is insane!

@everyone:
Trampa, the bad guys who helped getting things straight for the good of the project (all that legal shit you can't deny its necessary to care about).
The bad guys who financed the badly needed TMs in Benjamins hands. The bad guys who helped to get out an entire fresh new software and hardware design, that will go OS btw. We are talking about 100% new code! The bad guys, who flew around the globe to make things happen. The bad guys who spend hundreds of hours on R&D, compliance research, web platform, consulting top notch OS-Attorneys and advisors. The bad guys developing a transparent funding platform and licensing model that is due to be launched, so that funding is guaranteed and transparent in future. The bad guys who never did anything for the project, despite the few things mentioned above anyone else could have done - but didn't do. 

Now Trampa is ready for a shit storm because things are not exactly the way everyone want's things to be, which is not possible btw. and also a matter of international legislation we can't change.

Why do you go after us and not Benjamin? 
Because he didn't find the time for a communication strategy - because he is working so hard on badly needed OS-code that he doesn't find the time to answer 100 mails a day or be active on a forum or finish everything at the same time or just because you need a good guy and a bad guy for the ease of stereotype thinking. 

Things are really quite complex and were debate forth and back. 

Cool down, relax, be patient, respect the TM policies BV decided to use for the project, which are pretty fair btw., based on the Linux TM policies. 

Its impossible to bang on everything you want to happen simultaneously! Its simply a matter of lack of manpower.

I feel all the vendors who are making more robust versions of the VESC 4.12xxx whatever should all adopt a new and completely different prefix, and all use this same prefix followed by their version.

Trampa and BV have chosen each other, and should bear all future marketing responsibility for any name remotely eluding to VESC. Why give them any free marketing for the new-for-profit-VESCs? 

If everyone adopts the same prefix for their 4.12xxx it won't take long for that to be what everyone is talking about, and wanting for half the price. Each of those vendors can still continue to support BV directly however they'd like. 

Isn't a more robust Direct Fet 4.12xxx whatever in the $100 - $150 range (case versus no case) enough for 99% of esk8 applications?

Reposting this here as I put on wrong thread....

I sat on the sidelines because i am new to this community and believe this community is collaborative and awesome....but with the smoke and mirrors act going on here i could stay silent no longer....below are just my opinions based on my experiences as a former intellectual property attorney....changed practice many years ago because it was soooo boring writing patents all day....

Since VESC is protected by at least an EU registration...and the Registrant now seeks to enforce the rights there needs to be an alternative generic name.....you can not exclude the public from using descriptive or generic terms to describe a product...what would we use?..."the ESC that Benjamin Vedder and the community improved for electric skateboards"??....that's a mouthful......

Remember trademarks are for source identification....not for describing the product....

If trampa et al has a descriptive term they want the public to use instead of VESC then it should be shared before everyone else comes up with an alternative as they might not like what people come up with...because let's face it ESC is absolutely a generic and descriptive term for an electronic speed controller and that is what these are....and adding a V arguably doesn't make it distinctive....imho...all due respect to Vedder as he is a pioneer....

In fact, the almost universal use of VESC for the improved ESC by the esk8 community and the allowance of same until now may have already relegated the "mark" to arguably a genetic status...

Even though registered in the EU  I would suggest that VESC will have a hard time being registered in the US as it is arguably already generic...a trademark examiner at the USPTO will simply Google VESC and see how it is used to universally describe an ESC that is improved for esk8s....

Kimberly-clark had to spend millions to teach the public that it is a "facial tissue" not a kleenex ...it was the first account we had to read in TM class in law school....

Google ...genericized trademark....

I fully believe in protecting one's work efforts...but unless the TM owner either changes the narrative (ie give the public a generic term and encourage it's widespread use) or starts filing very expensive suits...that horse has left the barn.....

All they have done should be right?
Also the statement, where Trampa has seen the pictures
From the ESC what we have visually changed and
It has packed in a beautiful case.
Also the statement, kindly pointed out!
This is exactly what Trampa has written to me!
Original text of Trampa to me:

Hi Attila, well you go your own ways!

Two notes: It would be nice if your customers could assign the hardware. Base 4.12 should also be communicated, as confusion occurs at the latest when the firmware is selected.
Vesc-Tool will recognize this as V4.12er!
Or do you own firmware?

If everyone takes his own hardware number, best in the near 12.45, then this is at the expense of the customer, which is no longer clear!

Please do not call the thing Vesk or Vesk8!
Is indeed a nice name play but:
From a legal point of view, the phonetics count for a brand! You can also not simply sell a Merzetes or a Vauwe or Äpple, Äbble etc. Please change this quickly on your website, Facebook, Forum!
Väsk, Fesk, everything does not go! Similar phonetics and the same product are completely excluded! There is no compromise for the brand! Is not meant evil, but please understand that it is no different.

LG, Frank

To remain compliant with the open source CC licence, I suppose you will then publish all changes that you make to the reference design, including pcbs, right ?

If Trampa sells a version that is derived from a reference design but still based on the vesc, the licence makes it mandatory to release all the plans, doesn't it ?

Benjamin and I spend hours on thinking what is the bast way to stipulate innovation and product variety, which is in the favour of customers and vendors. Truth is: @onloop  and @chaka and @esk8 did the right thing, going down the inventive line. Congratulations for helping getting new stuff out! Its something really good and appreciated! More choice is no bad thing for the community. VESC-Tool will probably support these design straight away (recognized as VESC 4.12 by the software).

Having a special product might require a special heat sink layout and might require a special PCB layout. There is no "one solution good for every purpose" layout . So a reference design will help to start making your own hardware, which can't be "protected by CC" anyway. That would require a global patent, which is to expensive and maybe even not possible to acquire. Open Hardware is a nice idea but only enforceable with patents. Hardware is visible, while code is not, if encrypted. Benjamin is so much after Open Source to avoid others from having the same issues and trouble he had, needing to reinvent the same or similar code all the time. Its not about making technology available free of charge and instantly! Its about showing how a matter can be solved and preventing others to go through the same muddy swamp over and over.

So making code available by GPL is a totally different thing than releasing hardware designs.  A reference design can be produced straight away, just like the VESC 4.12 reference design you can find on Git Hub. So its your choice weather to produce the reference design, or invest some time and effort into improving stuff or tweaking stuff to your requirements. If you wish to share your design, great! If not, you share it anyway, since you sell it and show it. In the EU you will be granted a three year valid DESIGN protection by publishing your design. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_design. That is for non technical stuff, like a special destictive design. You may use that right or not, your choice!

If you play it fair, you don't copy other peoples commercial design, but rather get a bit inventive yourself.

Truth is: everyone making the same hardware, purely competing on price is not going to help the project a lot in future. Manufacturers will cut corners to drop the price further and that will end in quality and safety issues and finally in tears.  

If you make your very own hardware you might be able to set your own price, which linked to the quality you offer. If someone decides to send every single PCBs through X-Ray, that might ad to the production cost and final pricing, but it will also ad to the reliability of the product. Same refers to original BOM etc. 
If your design looks the same, smells the same but is more expensive, you might be able to explain that to well informed customer. But you will have a hard time to explain it to a poorly informed customer. Most people a price driven. Until you understand the fine details you might have blown up three Controllers. That can be more expensive than buying a nice one in the first place.

Sure everyone should be allowed to offer a repair service. Its good to repair things rather than creating a pile of waste. Who the hell believes anyone would stop anyone to offer a repair service? 
Just open up a website and state: **We offer a VESC(R)* repair service.** 
*VESC(R) is a TM, owned by Benjamin Vedder, this is his website: www.vesc-project.com

Maybe you shouldn't use a VESC-Domain but rather your companies/projects domain.

So ... VESC-tool, reference design (not pcb design) and code will be open-sourced (like all VESC stuff before). 

Can you give some insight on your plan to license your pcb to vendors - as Vedder has made such a great pcb, why would you make small vendors waste their money to design the whole pcb + metal casing from the reference design. Surely it would be more cost-effective for the community to decide on some sellers for the VESC and together each year put together a percentage of their profits for Vedder to use and make the next VESC. That way it is not only you that has to pour money into the VESC and then have to charge way higher than others to not go into dept - you have been nice but I think sharing the cost would decrease the price per unit to consumers and would not result in the community being split between your really good (but really expensive) VESCs and others good (and fairly priced) VESCS/ ESCs based on the VESC.

See, final pricing is hard to guess until you talk about volume and other factors influencing the price. 
We don't know where average HW version 6 prices will be, since its not jet in the market by a number of vendors really. Benjamin still needs some more time and BETA needs to be evaluated to generate a good, cheap to make and stable reference design. There are many things that can be done to decrease the price and I think no one wants to pay more than necessary. There is no need for small vendors to design a PCB! Just garb the Git hub located files and start making it. I really think the reference design wants a more simple heat sink, so that it can be made more cost efficient, if that is the wish. Maybe just a laser cut flat metal piece, bolted onto a PCB, dropped in heat shrink. Simple, non complex. I also think a reference design should be reproducible with little to no tools, so that non profit projects can make a pile of PCBs for their equipment. Just my thoughts....

Guys, I need to crack on and need to focus on things, so that you will soon have all the information that you demand.

As always stated, once finished >> Open Source! 
Its useless to OS stuff before the Software and web-platform is bang on! 
Finally all the feedback needs to be dealt with. That can only happen if a good structure is existing. Beside writing the al new code this is also tons of work. 

Quote Benjamin: http://vedder.se/forums/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=590&start=10

_Anyway, a lot is happening, and I hope that this year will be interesting for hobby motor control. Regarding the source code release, a few people have been helping me with testing and I have also given the current firmware source code to a few who are familiar with it so that they can make configurations for their hardware, but currently it is difficult for me to deal with all the feedback and questions. The goal is to get contribution guidelines and a description of how parts in the firmware work on the project website in time for the release so that people won't waste too much time trying to understand everything from just reading code and ask more questions than I can manage to answer. So far several people have invested quite a bit of time on the firmware and if they had known several things about it from the beginning it would have made their life easier. The fact that I haven't been able to respond to all questions I got after they spent so much time also makes me feel bad. This is the main reason that I haven't uploaded the latest source code yet - now people wait rather than digging too deep into the outdated firmware, which is best before there is sufficient documentation and contribution guidelines for it. There are also other opinions on handling this situation rather than delaying the release as I do now, but this is my way of handling the situation and I hope that everyone can understand that._

It´s like buying fake Nike shoes (they call it Nike in china without a problem) from Asia and selling them here under another name - still illegal. (sorry for the bad comparison @onloop :smiley: )
[/quote]
If you don't call it nike and there is no nike logo on them why should it be illegal as long as they even look different in color and shape as genuine Nike shoes? otherwise how can we be sure that all our shoes are not in fact relabelled nike shoes ;)? By removing the VESC branding like @rwxr has shown you should not have any problems (at least this is my understanding of the situation)

We named our revision "Ollin ESC v1.XX". We had originally named them "Direct-VESC", it was a violation of the Trademark since Vedder did not make the revision changes. After speaking with Ben I was happy to follow his guidelines and change the name. 

@JohnnyMedusa I think that repair company decided to use the new trademark as an excuse to stop taking in repairs from unknown suppliers. 

I think everyone here would have been much happier if @trampa  took a role as a silent backer to Benjamins project. If the release of version 6 was done under a different website without any affiliation to an existing board company the release would have been much more successful.

That's best for the project! There is something in place, so that customers can identify your hardware as being compatible or **supportive and compatible**. We thought of a lot of things, but couldn't go public for legal reasons.

As far as understanding the trademark process, I almost ignored that as it has nothing to do with the question at hand.  I don't know if you don't understand that or are just misdirecting.  Regardless, this is the research I've done in the last few says to make sure I DO understand TM's.

While I am no expert, I think this amount of research gave me a basic understanding of the benefits and process of Trademarks in general.  What I still don't understand is why you are flexing your muscles on this...in fact I've seen nothing that shows you've got muscles to flex, you just kind of jumped in and started telling people what to do.

I'm going to try and explain this as simply as I can...for the third time.

The issue that is being discussed here is not the presence of a trademark, the issue is that YOU are the one flexing your muscles and telling people what they can and cannot do.  The VESC was turned into a viable hardware platform by this community.  You have supplied no innovation, have not built the platform, have not done anything that helps the VESC platform, you just walked in and "purchased" the right to tell builders what they can and cannot do.  

I would ask 2 questions of YOU, not BV, not your lawyers, YOU.

1.  What does this action that YOU are taking do for the community & what do you hope to achieve?
2.  Why was this action taken in the first place, what was the problem that existed that you are uniquely qualified to resolve?

I have discussed with @trampa and he said BV will be making a statement tonight/ tomorrow. He made a good point that with the reference designs, it doesn't take long to make a pcb, but it was the software that took 14 months and having done that evidently (as the whole community wants) he should Trademark it and protect it as the 'official' code. As they both worked on it, though the trademarks are signed by Vedder, the hardware is signed with BOTH Vedder and Trampa. For this reason, @trampa can sell the VESC 6. Like with the Vesc-x the reference designs will be open-source (but not the PCBs as far as I can understand) as it is up to the seller how to make them. This allow flexibility for vendors - cheap vendors will find ways to cut corners and @trampa will make really high quality pcbs. However, because of the great difference in quality and flexibility offered to vendors, different vendors should market them their own way and steer clear of the Trademarks. I think that listing an esc as 'based of the VESC' (however the examples say it) is the best way vendors should go, and then put a picture of pcb, changes if made, advantages of their pcb ....

@trampa has not payed me to say this ;) but it is important that everyone waits before reiterating their view points as BV will make a statement about his thoughts that apparently will 'clarify a lot'.

The main question I still don't understand is why trampa? What have they actually done to improve the VESC over the past 3 or so years? Nothing. 

What has @chaka done:
Released all the PCB file for nunchuck rf, VESCs, be open about his upgrades to the Vesc and how the community can use them to make more reliable VESCs.
And probably more that I don't know about

What has @onloop done:
Create an improved VESC (X) and share all the reference designs
Put money into the advertising of the VESC
And probably more that I don't know about

I'm not here to cause any more arguments. I just want to know why BV went with trampa and not say someone like @chaka . But at the end of the day I guess we all just have to move on... and never buy from trampa again for screwing what we've ALL worked hard to build over the past 3 years.

There's probably a lot of practical reasons for BV to choose Trampa. 

Trampa had money to front for R&D and prototypes.
Trampa is UK-based which is 90 minutes by air from Sweden and tickets costs like $25-$50.
Trampa is not a one-man-show and therefore has time to deal with all the things that isn't HW/SW development.

This is only speculations of course, but Benjamin is a clever guy and I'm sure he knows what he's doing.
I understand that people are upset, but wait for Benjamins statement before throwing stones.

BV could go the rout of using a testing facility to approve the VESC, then he can dictate the standards and everyone who passes those standards can sell the VESC and no one company can hold the title.  Much like HDMI or USB, in order to sell the cables and put your name on it you have to have it tested to a certain standard at a certified third party testing facility like UL, BV, ETL.  A Percentage of the money for testing would go to Benjamin the rest would go to whoever is testing.  Or just change the name,

We tell him of course why not 
And what he would get for a discount
We thought ok he wants 10 pcs or more
Then we gave him the v. 4.12 cheaper
He ordered 2 pcs and said we were greedy
And he could get the V 4.12 in Asia for 40-50 $
to let produce, 
Our greed went so far that we had a new manufacturer for 4.12

BV stated on his forums vedder.se/forums his cooperation with Trampa (however one of the moderators managed to delete the post). They could have formed a new company and new sales channel - but let's face it - this is the easiest way to get the product out for both of them. Trampa has agreed to do a lot of the work BV can't handle. I don't see the big fuzz about this. Benjamin wants to sell his own hardware and he is cooperating with trampa. The products are a part of his own work. Maybe I am to ignorant, but don't see a problem with this. @chaka has managed to comply with it and I see no problems. I will gladly buy VESC 6 hardware from @esk8 in the future with another branding - I know your name as well :)

An "esk8.de controller based upon VESC" is a quality mark! 

PS: Those who are eager to see the new schematics - a (not final) version is posted as PDF on Vedders's forums.

Wrong: HW version 6 and PCB will go OS!
We just decided its best to publish a generic and adoptable design, rather than a super specific design. You can make the reference design, just like the VESC 4 reference design, or adopt, improve, downgrade, upgrade, change the design and start to manufacture that.  (mix, reuse, improve)
That's the best way forward to allow more flexibility and innovation. 
If you are interested in seeing only one design being made over and over without improvements or changes we can't help you.

Get a bit innovative and offsets your HW from the competition! Its good for you, the customer and the Project. If you feel that publishing your changes is good, fine! Its up to you. Hardware is always visible and unless patented it is public domain anyway.
You can reverse engineer any hardware! It probably easier to just make your own and probability wiser.
Code is only visible if its published and not encrypted. That is one of many reason to OS it.

Some applications may not need 5KW output and other may not need NRF or other features. The one shoe fits all theory is not reality.

The VESC Project is 95% a software project, not a HW Project. Without the Software your HW will not spin any motor a quarter turn and the Software is 98% of the work.

Darth Frank

Ps.: The reference design is probably very close to our design, just a bit more easy to replicate, withou the need for a 2-3K mould.

5KW is a lot, but nice, since the thing stays very cool at 2500W output. Hardly hand warm....

Alternatively you can use the dark force!

I dont understand why @esk8 make such a big thing out of it. Just rename your ESC and thats it. I can understand why Benjamin doesnt want to be related to VESCs with a bad production quality. When @onloop tries to bring the production price down as low as possible to make the most profit out of it, with saving some capacitors for example (one big Elko instead of three), Benjamin dont want to have his name on that ripoff product which will fail more often and people think that refers to every VESC. So they are saying "the VESC often fails" instead of "the VESC from enertion often fails".
Also a lot of guys here are just speaking of the VESC as an electric skateboard ESC. But it is more a ESC that can be used for a lot of different things (ebike, robotic, other eVehicles etc.) which all have different requirements to the hardware. So with different hardware for every special scope it makes totally sense to also name the hardwares different, so you can identify that the XXXX controller for example is produced by XXXX and specialized for high power ebikes, so with a higher possible input voltage. So as @trampa said the companies should make their own hardware with their own special needs.
Btw that also means that for example @trampa isn't appropriate with the VESC 6.0 hardware when the PCB is ready for a MPU, but they dont mount the IC.

@esk8 You always say that @trampa doesnt say the whole truth. So why you don't start with telling us exactly how much you really spend to Benjamin instead of just saying you spend "something"? I believe that this "something" isn't even close to a fair amount what Benjamin deserves.

Wrong: HW version 6 and PCB will go OS!We just decided its best to publish a generic and adoptable design, rather than a super specific design.
[/quote]

I hope I explain it propperly:
You explain here, that the VESC 6 is the referenz design that will go OS.
Why can you call your Version, that is slightly differnt to the referenz design (that is the VESC6 with that sentence), VESC 6? shouldnt it be called different, just like VESC4,12 and VESK8?

and it would be also nice to answer my question earlier in the Thread.

You can do a lot in a different way. Use other FETs, rearrange components, heat sink design, with or without NRF, other DRV chip, as long as supported by firmware.
We call our official design VESC SIX to be precise. Revision 6.4 is the current status.

The reference design will also have a revision number. E.g. RD 6.4
How others will call their Hardware is up to them. VESC-Tool can identify designs based on the reference design and will find the corresponding firmware (FW 6). 
The HW 4 based derived Vescs will automatically be detected as HW 4.
Calling something 8 is probably not wise, since Vesc-Tool will recognize it as HW 6. Could get confusing for customers, or disappointing.... Maybe its wise to use a corresponding revision number. 

The firmware is integrated in Vesc-Tool btw, no need to download it separately.

Please read the thread and you know what it is!
Trampa has told me that may not use name Vesc no more because it is TM and now in hand from Trampa/BV
Then it was about the name VESK8 I can not use it because of the similarity. Trampa forbidden.
I say you  for the last time that you are not targeted at my person.
Stay at the origin of the trade:
Why the Vesc 4.12 can not be used as Vesc 4.12 this is also clarified, because of TM of Trampa/BV
The rest you can see in the Tread
Reading educates
What all the others have left out at the Vesc or not to save money, was not the question here.
You yourself made a lot of trade for the Vesc. 4.12 to build oneself.
Since you know exactly what the original Vesc according to BV on it belongs
We always have the original Vesc 4.12 build and sold with the original Part
that we not kicked the product from BV with feet .
Trampa would have to know also, since Trampa also several Vesc 4.12 bought with us
You always ask me the same question:
How much money i digine
How much profit I make
I have a suggestion:
My address is on my HP
You are welcome to come to me
And I'll show you black on white ok.
And you get a coffee of course as well.
I think times that here all know the Vesc Can be used for many other things, but since this is here a skateboard forum so the Vesc here also using for that. 
It took a long time that you come and let go on me what was going on you were on vacation?
Please in future if you want to know personal things everything by PM
But you can ask Trampa, onloop, Unik, and al the other Seller about her business
and how much money they earn, maybe you'll have luck you get an answer!
And now be a good boy and go play with your copters.
Good luck and have a nice day!

@TarzanHBK: Just do not promote them as VESC and do not sell them as VESC, Black out the Logo for the now. You can request some without logo the next time. Legally Jason can't ship to Europe with VESC Logo on anyway, so you should get them in harmony with the TM the next time.
Vendors or Importers should not use the Mark when promoting or selling towards Europe. If you have a Website up, promoting towards Europe and selling towards Europe,  best choice is to stay clear of the Vedder Mark. 

Fair use if fine btw. Calling it e.g. 
"Jason's Brand-X" based upon the VESC(R) project. Vesc is a registered TM by Benjamin Vedder.

At the time too much things were unclear, so I skipped the plan and bought my vescs somewhere else. I´m not a fan of blacking out a logo for it to be somewhat legal - I´m a german potato and like clear things, you know what I´m talking about :slight_smile: 

My thoughts about the situation:
I like the idea of vedder earning more money with his creation, but I see the "old" Vesc as a community engineering thing. Especially all the nice guys here on the forum, who contributed a lot to it and have made it as big as it is today.
I also think that all the people here selling the 4.12 are giving a percentage back to vedder.
On the other hand, there a bigger companies like maytech, who just took it and sell it without giving something back (as far as I know - don´t like to judge too much).
So what happens now. The "small" have to change but the bigger asian companies are still able to do whatever they like and you won´t get a hold of them.
What would be a cool solution:
Leave the 4.12 as it is, because people are used to it, in the selling and buying point of view. Why not only saving the "new" thing and make it special this way? Wouldn´t hurt anyone and all the people would be happy again :slight_smile: #flowerpower #Ilikeyouall #fukyea

It isn't clear how much the VESC 4.12 sellers were giving and legally they can't be soft on their trademark. The problem with calling it VESC 4.12 is it would use the trademark still, though of course it has been used for ages before the trademark.

@JTAG: Be fair and price ia good portion of R&D costs in, wich should go into BV's pocket! 
Without the Software your ESC will not spin a motor a quater turn!

If you market it don't forget VAT, company TAX, handling, shipping, product returns, time spent with it and all the other costs that ad up, like customer support. When you want to keep it fair, these costs need to be considered. Paying TAX lets our Kids go to school and pays for the hospitals we need and roads we drive on! 

Doing something direct and cheap is nice for a single customer but will erode a lot of jobs we all want to have in future. There are always tow sides on a coin! We know everyone wants everything cheap - don't forget the consequences for the society you live in. Companies can be greedy but also individuals!

Can you please explain me what "all the nice guys here on the forum" have contributed to the project? I am really interested in that point, because I don't get it. I see that it became more popular because some guys were pushing it, but just with the interest to sell more. So from my point of view the VESC 4.12 was build 98% from Benjamin and maybe 2% by others for example finding bugs or made small changes to the firmware compared to the ton of things Benjamin did.
When you call nothing and under 1% from the selling price a percentage they pay to vedder then thats ok. For me it is just a bad joke.
I am not sure, but I think also the asian manufactures react when a lawyer is knocking at the door. But we will see what is happening.

@hexakopter I have quote @onloop below for what I think was meant by the 'nice guys'. I am happy that now with the VESC 6 more money will be going to Vedder, but disagree about asian manufacturers - trademark in china is not a thing (good lock companies in china have to keep making new better locks each year for this reason).  
[quote="onloop, post:15, topic:23017"]
Im not sure if most people are aware of this fact.... 

Benjamin Vedder didn't actually create the name "VESC" 

In fact, it was the ESK8 community who created the name "VESC"It was also the ESK8 community that made this project VERY popular.

Quick History lesson;

Firstly, if it wasn't for @ austindavid & @torqueboards for originally publishing info about benjamins ESC none of us esk8ers would have Known about it.

The name itself was coined by @ Beto_pty who originally made the name Vedders Endless Sphere Controller: https://endless-sphere.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=35&t=63540&start=125#p957046

If it wasn't for @ jacobbloy who was the first person to organize a group buy (BV also did some too).

And @ chaka for reworking the hardware to improve reliability

And for everyone else (users) for testing & providing feedback. Without the community the VESC just wouldnt be a "thing"

I agree that a ton of work went into projects USING the VESC but actual contributions TO the VESC have been scarce.
@chaka made some with upgraded components but that is about it. BV may include some features @Ackmaniac has been working on but AFAIK there has not been communication between the two.

To attribute 10% to these efforts is way over the top. It is still BV's sole project and without him nothing would get improved.
All changes on github have been made by BV alone with some very minor exceptions.

Also we tend to overestimate the importance of "our" community to the success of the VESC. The VESC is an awesome general purpose BLDC controller and is used not just for esk8s but in robotics, ebikes, and industrial applications to drive pumps, conveyor belts etc.
To say that the VESC wouldn't be a thing without us is ridiculous.

Really? 
Communication modules and Apps are not part of the official project as far as I know.
That is all separate I think and that is fine. Some stuff is commercial and locked down as far as I know.
Contribution means feeding into the original source, not opening up side projects.
Sure it is nice to have more accessory! 
Propose a thing, write some code, send it to Benjamin for review and it might be integrated in the future.
Side projects:You should give your side projects a separate name! That's all! Its nothing bad.
Stand in with your name for what you do! 

e.g. Communication module by xy, compatible with VESC(R)* based controllers.

Sure, its good to create ad ons. People do that with our equipment all the time, but they don't market them as Trampa. They say _compatible with Trampa_ or _for Trampa truck_, or _fitting Trampa Trucks_. Some say Trampa mounts etc. That is not 100% correct BTW and it should not be named like that!

Its all about playing it Fair! Its not about excluding someone or being greedy or other things. 
Let Benjamin have his Name and Brand for the Project and use the TM fair and with respect.
That's all he is demanding and stated pretty clear in the TM Policies! You can't have the code, Hardware layout and the TM. That is to demanding and not good for the Project. The Project needs solid legal foundations and the right to its name is a vital part of it. Without that, a fiasko is pre-programmed. Nearly every single OS-Project has the rights to its name through the use of TMs. There is a good reason for that!
People need to be able to identify the original source and the TM is the only way to achieve it.
Not everyone is so well informed as some experienced users here on the forum. Always think about the inexperienced, or new to the topic user! They need to be able to identify the original project. 
Its not a bitter pill, its for the good of the Project. 

Anyone saying, we are profiting of the VESC-Brand: Maybe true, but also risky as you can see! Every Coin has two sides. But we also put tons of effort in and spend a fortune on R&D, travel expenses, TMs for Ben and many more. Endless hours of thinking and making vital decisions for the future of the Project. Setting up a way for him to get stable donations in his pocket + building up strong foundations, which are inevitable to have when building up a Project, is also something taking time.
We do the Hardware in cooperation with Benjamin and he has gains in future. We are probably not the ones going for super high volume production and will for sure never be the cheapest supplier. Its a Benjamin approved piece of Hardware with a higher value price tag, due to pricing in R&D and going for the ultimate quality. 
So we will probably only have a small slice of the cake anyway. There is enough food on the table for everyone. Don't be greedy, take what you can eat, not more.
Benjamin can't handle Hardware production and customer support, due to the lack of infrastructure and time. So he needs someone to team up with if you guys ever want to see a official HW distribution. If its not us, its someone else! He decided to do it with us, that is the way it is. 
Everyone is pretty much at the limit and answering all forum questions is time consuming as well. 

I know the TM thing causes some frustrations, but you have to shine light onto it from all sides to fully understand it.

I've read this whole thread and can see both sides.
I think the real issue is how it was handled. BV certainly deserves to be in control of his own invention and reap the rewards from that work.

My concern is the way it was rolled out. I just wish 6 months ago or whenever Trampa and BV finalized their arrangement it was announced and they gave the other venders time to make adjustments and sell off stock with the vesc branding. Just giving them and the community a grace period before enforcing the TM would have been nice and given plenty of time before the Vesc 6 was released.

No ones wants you to trash existing hardware! Its not good for the environment! You can rename it on your website and black out the logo on HW, using a marker pen. Just a suggestion.... Its not that hard to conform. A new batch can have a new logo. The TM thing was known since Jan 17: https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/vedders-vesc-6-0/3813/190?u=trampa

I contacted some vendors and they are fully informed but didn't change things until today.

Benjamin's statement is awaited! 
I called him and he agreed on sending it out this week.
Change the name, if you are marketing and selling towards markets with TM protection.

Hey Frank,

I'm 33. I'm not sure what that has to do with anything. How old are you?

Not saying you have to agree with my train of thought but for me I'm 12 at heart- I mean we build and ride electric skateboards for fucks sake.

It seems that the common nomenclature for a popular piece is changing and I see your point and maybe it is for the best.....I also see this as an opportunity to crack wise and laugh at ourselves and hobby. 

The discussions on here have been heated or " a shit storm" and I thought they could use a bit of humor.

If it seems juvenile to your adult sensabilities I appologize......but again.......we ride skateboards ........and strap stupidly strong motors and batteries to them ......and sometimes FUKYEAs and SEXMACHINEs ( *note I'm respecting the trademark) ......and then go flying around our respective cities, forests and monuments ( very jealous of @unik and iconic tower), and make videos, and laugh, and make shit, and solve problems and break shit.

But again sorry, if you found it offensive.

Love,
Hunter

From ben : 
http://vedder.se/forums/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=733

**It seems like several people are upset because I have obtained a trademark on the name VESC, so I would like to clarify a few things about that. For now this long post can be used as a reference if people are asking about the trademark.

At first I had no idea about trademarks and did not care about them either. Frank (from trampaboards) told me that it is very important to have a trademark and that I should get one if I want to take VESC project further. An international trademark is very expensive and I had no way to pay for it, so trampa offered me to pay for it hoping that the VESC6 production that we planned to do together would cover at least that cost. In the same go Frank also booked time with a lawyer who had a lot of experience about open source projects and talked about the risks that I might be at when publishing software and hardware as open source that can potentially be dangerous for users. Reading the cryptic law texts it looked like I can become responsible if something happens, which worried me A LOT for a while after hearing about it, but the lawyer said that it is very unlikely that I will get into trouble in practice and that the responsibilities are with the company that sells the hardware. This is the strongest reason that I don't want to sell hardware myself directly.

To make the deal with trampa clear:

1. The trademark is registered in my name alone, and I let them use it when selling the VESC6. I have made the design, checked the production carefully and share the profits of the sales with them from the VESC6, so the VESC6 hardware sold by trampa has a strong connection to my name. I want to point out that I have no obligation to stay with trampa for the "official" VESC hardware in the future as the trademark is in my name, so this is really a choice that I make myself.

2. Trampa has the legal responsibility for the sold hardware. After what I learned I would never sell hardware myself as I can get into deep trouble when doing that, so for me and the community this is a much better option than not having any hardware available at all where I have been involved in the production and quality checks to this extent.

3. Considering the costs for the trademark, legal stuff, testing, traveling, compliance testing etc, the VESC6 hardware is not likely to generate any profit any time soon. No one is even getting paid for the hours spent on this. For trampa the gain is that they will have a very good motor controller that they can sell with their boards for the best user experience, and for me this is a step in the direction of making a solid foundation for the VESC project.

Going back to the trademark, there are many good reasons to have a trademark and all major open source projects have one. For one thing, there are many countries where a trademark is first come, first serve and if a project gains critical mass there are people who will get a trademark and try to take advantage of that. Here is an example where that happens:

https://retropie.org.uk/2017/02/legal-help-needed/

Further, only one person or company can have a trademark, and for the VESC I think it is most appropriate that I have the trademark since I have literally spent years on the software development for the VESC. It is also kind of funny that many people see the VESC as the hardware that is around that many people have tweaked and made in the community; that is not where the value of the VESC project is. The great majority of the work is in the software. I can make a new PCB in a few days, and the software has taken me years to write. The hardware is only a tiny fraction of the work.

The trademark policies, which can be found here

http://www.vesc-project.com/trademark_policies_page

are very much based on the linux trademark policies, which is shared under a CC license. Other open source projects that have trademarks are raspberry pi, arduino, gnome, mozilla, joomla, drupal and many more. Joomla for example has some trademark FAQs that probably apply to most open source projects and their trademarks:

https://tm.joomla.org/trademark-faq.html

In general the trademark does not exclude the community from getting involved with the VESC Project and making/selling hardware, it is intended for making it possible to identify things that are called VESC with myself. Right now there are many websites out there that look like the official VESC website, and people who find them often think that they are from me. For example, many people have asked my about "my" site vesc.co.uk and products they bought there when in fact I have nothing to do with that site or their products. If you open that site and several others it is not easy to tell that they are not published by me, and that is a problem in general which a trademark is supposed to protect against.

Fair use of the trademark essentially is that you can base your design/product on all the open source software and hardware that I have published (following the license terms as usual), but you have to sell it under your own name and give attribution to the project. For example "XSC, based on the open source VESC(R) project". There are some examples of what is fair use and what is not if you read my trademark policies.

I think there is nothing wrong with me not wanting to be associated with things that I don't even know about or have anything to do with, and that is what a trademark is for.


I also want to mention the partner program briefly that I'm working on. Several people have gotten really crazy ideas that I want to use the trademark to claim money from them for all the VESC4 that they have sold until now, and that is certainly not the case. Anyone can use the things I have published just as before and sell it under their own name; and they don't have to pay me anything. All they have to do, just as before, is complying with the GPL license for the software, meaning among other thing that if they change the software they have to publish the changes as well. The idea with the partner program is to have manufacturers for example pay a small amount per unit they sell in exchange for having them listed as compatible hardware under the VESC-project website and for me maintaining support for their hardware in VESC Tool and the VESC firmware for future updates of the software. But again, no one is forced to do that and they can just do their own thing with the VESC open source stuff under their own name and not pay me anything. I hope however that enough manufacturers will see some value in supporting the project so that maybe eventually the income will be enough to pay for a salary or two. Then development of e.g. open source apps can be accelerated by paying developers. This is not my only plan for trying to get a bit of funds from the project while keeping it open source and involving more manufacturers, but I will not write more details about that here. I'm working on the VESC Project website and trying to set everything up and explain things there.

Thi is more rhetoric from @trampa.  No One is disputing the fact that BV should have the trademark, or that its a problem by any stretch of the imagination.  I doubt there's anyone on this forum that is not deeply and profoubndly respectful of BV and all the work he has done.  That is not the issue at all, never has been.

The issue is that a virtual newcomer to powered boards "BUYS" his way into the VESC manufacturing & development process and then starts flexing his muscles.

I hope someone that knows BV will take a minute and explain to him the truth of this backlash and not the bullshit that Frank is apparently stating as fact.

Having the VESC tool detect hardware version as Version 6 instead of 6.4 is very confusing because it does not dictate to changes to the end users.

It can detect specific versions... 
It would still see if you plug in a HW4 or 6 or something special. I wasn't very precise, sorry. Benjamin can integrate all sorts of FW and detect the corresponding HW. Easy for the user.

as a consumer I welcome this move.
When I first started I naively thought all vescs were created equal.
Now I know if I buy from Trampa it's the vesc vedder designed, as per the bom. He backs this with his reputation, and doesn't have his name tarnished by manufacturers who stray from the BOM and look to produce cheaply.
I still have options, I can buy a cheaper one, or an authentic one.
If you think trampa have fooled him into this move you are not paying the man BV enough respect.

I currently have Three Enertion VESC 4.12 and two Enertion VESC-X and they all seem to work just fine so far (VESC-X  have only been tested for a 5 mile smooth ride under 18mph, they are for future a CarvOn v3 build)

Unlike some people, I have had a good experience with the VESCs @onloop 's people produced....Because of what I'm reading here I'm not sure I would ever be an "official VESC" buyer in the near future because it seems like Frank basically just made what we like to call a "dick move". Totally unnecessary move from a user's (as oppose to a business owner's) stand point. I do understand their view on a need to trademark A name, but did you really have to go and trademark a name that we've all been using for a while? Couldn't you have said Trampa will call it the TrampVESC and no one can use our TrampStamp?! you literally tramp stamped the VESC!

Maybe we are no newcomers but were just patient enough. I work with Ben for quite a while now. I always said: If we ever make a VESC, it will need to be a lot better than 4.12 + we will only make it if Benjamin and the project gets a sufficient kickback (not talking about money only). So that was the point where VESC-Tool was initiated. Because a better controller needed better software. Both of us knew that VESC-Tool will be a hell of a job to code, needing a 100% new code. We are talking about roughly 120 folders, some containing 1000 pages of complicated code!
Probably we didn't  BUY ourselves in but rather bit the bullet! Its not so much about money, its about endurance. Money won't code your software! Only endless effort and patience from a very very talented driver developer outputs that kind of Software. 

TRAMPA is no money driven company! We handcraft our Boards in the UK and usually ship the same day you place an order! If you are after money you don't do such a crazy thing. Trampa is kudos driven, not money driven. Never paid myself a salary in all the years. The amount of work in building up the company probably equals more than the amount of work Benjamin put into the VESC-Software. So the ethos we share is pretty much the same. Kudos driven, not money driven!

BTW: The current funding situation of the VESC-Project is best compared to a river bed in the Sahara in Summer. Don't blame us for being a bit supportive! If everyone would have given sufficient support, would have priced in a bit of R&D for Benjamin, he could have financed a lot himself without the need of a donor like us. Its a disgraceful situation! 
There will be a funding system available soon, as Benjamin stated. Lets see who has some backbones! 

To the very overlookable minority who supported Benjamin in the past: THX a lot, it helped and surely motivated Benjamin!

You can make use of the VESC Brand as stated in the TM policies! Its about fair use, linking back to Benjamin, so people see who is the man behind it. You should make use of it to show your respect to Benjamin anyway. So no one is excluded. Read the TM policies with care please. The bigger you all grow the brand VESC, the better your sales! You will still be selling a VESC capable device. 

There will be a new logo and name out, for those who support. This will also give access to a branded custom VESC-Tool with custom options (e.g. setting safe limits for HW and warranty exclusion in case of surpassing those limits) and custom FW support + back link to the VESC update server.
We will see a lot of software updates in the next time, customers shouldn't miss out. The firmware is a lot more complex now and I doubt that anyone will ever fully understand the code in detail, other than Benjamin. 
There are to many dependencies and messing around with the code could cause safety issues hard to foresee. Even Benjamin needs a good portion of time and patience for verification of changes.
I would leave that job to Benjamin for the safety of the riders.

FW is integrated deeply in the VESC-Tool software. So there is a bit of a dependency on his work, as it always existed.
VESC-TOOL is a BLDC-Tool 4.0
Its like comparing a flip phone from 2000 to a smartphone of today. Its a major step that has been taken. BETAs will report. Release is after Beta, to assure we can ad in the feedback from BETA.

We hope this is a good motivation for manufacturers of HW to join in and get part of the R&D support to allow faster progress in future. I think that this is in everyone's interest, especially the community. I want to see a highly skilled app developer sitting next to Benjamin very soon. That needs to be financed through a transparent funding structure and not a single entity like us. Small donations per manufactured VESC will ad up quickly! Customers should expect to pay a bit more per VESC soon but will get access to a way better software therefore. Its giving and taking! Without the software no HW will spin a motor a quarter turn!

Hope everyone agrees with what I said. 
We need to stand together to make an astonishing software project happening.
Benjamin and I set the foundations, now its up to you to help erect a nice building on top.

The problem that existed is that a lot of stuff was basically carried out on Benjamin's back and no one has seen that! The burden got to big and no one realized it. The project and the person behind it needs some serious backing mate. It was Benjamin's and my decision to give it that turn and not Darth Franks! Maybe Benjamin and I get along very well and we have a similar view on certain things. Ever thought about that? So we debated what to do and did it!
Its not your project and you are not defining the terms of how things are handled. If you don't like to hear that, I can't help you. Benjamin is no lemon you can suck out if you wish so. Obviously something must have been out of balance, and no one realized it. And the risks of getting TM-Problems one day is highly likely. But then it is to late. No one builds up a house on crappy foundations. That is stupid at best! Benjamin never liked that people used the VESC-Brand for a random quality. Get over it!

Then try that with Arduino! Super generic for controller... VESC is as specific for a certain OS project, as Arduino is for a certain OS-Project, or Linux is for a certain OS-Project.

Don't you think its enough to get the code and the hardware + fair use of TM? Do you really need the full access to the Vedder mark in addition?

I just bought some of your gear and i'm very impressed with it. I fully expect your version of the VESC to be just as polished and abuse resistant as your trucks and wheels and other hardware. I can think of much worse situations than you doing what you are doing here. 

That doesn't mean we're all going to just swallow it without probing and expressing concerns and opinions.

I would like to know what you base that on.  Its a fact he has told multiple people, who have been making VESC's for years, that they can longer use the name.

If you have some other reason as to why he is telling people they can no longer make VESC's then please tell me, the only reason I see is profit.  He is actively limiting your source to purchase the VESC.  Clasis market manipulation.

Out of the good of his heart?  LOL, he gave BV some money to get licensing rights.  He has told @onloop, @torqueboards, @esk8 and others that they can no longer sell the VESC as a VESC simply because he purchased the right to do so.  Legal doesn't make right.  Add to that the fact that he started all of this before he even has production setup for his own version for the VESC...well, that just makes him an asshat for CREATING a problem with supply.

On the topic of Trampa enforcing the usage of VESC on behalf of BV, I don't understand why this is upsetting. From BV's post it looks like Trampa is the exclusive licensor of the VESC name so why shouldn't Trampa defend it? When a company licenses a trade name they need to be able to defend it otherwise what's the point. For example if Adidas started selling Air Jordans would you be upset that Nike, as license holder to the Jordan brand, went and told Adidas to stop? What's going on here would be like saying Nike: "You didn't win any championships, you didn't put in all the effort to build Michael Jordan's name, you're just terrible for using Michael Jordan's name to sell your shoes!." This argument neglects that MJ and Nike entered into a mutually beneficial relationship to begin with and MJ, while he did create the brand through his work, needed a business to help increase the value and monetize the brand. 

Also keep in mind that BV has kept VESC trade name open for 4.xx and he still holds the trademark exclusively so if there are other serious hardware manufacturers out there they can also go to him and purchase the licensing rights -- not that BV is coin operated, from his statements it looks like he wants to be able to vet hardware manufacturer's quality before licensing out his name.

Nope, but I'd be pretty pissed if they said you can no longer sell shoes.  

At least you cant call them shoes anymore.  Also, the shoes that you have that say shoes?  Nope, cant sell them either.  To take it even further, in this scenario Adidas hasn't even made shoes yet, they are just saying they will (maybe, in the future, not sure yet) but they own the TM for 'shoes' so no one else can sell 'shoes'...yeah you Nike, no more shoes.  All those people that want shoes but want Nike shoes, nope cant have em, only our shoes....that we don't sell yet.  All those people that have shoes on the shelf and people making a living selling them, nope, screw them.

Does that clear up why I'm upset about this?  I hope that BV is just unaware of what @trampa is doing and will eventually weigh in.

Some of us are smarter than others and that's okay as long as you are not hurting anyone or being a total D-bag while making the profit. Trampa made a dick move.

I know the VESC name hasn't been around as long as something like...let's say a keyboard, imagine one day some fuker in Tramplandia tells everyone that what we can't call this thing a keyboard anymore because it's a trademark infringement and they own the name. How the hell would you respond huh? @trampa?  Do people start calling a keyboard a ClickyClacky until another person TMs that name?! If it ain't broke don't fix it.

It is really getting ridiculous now. You still don't get it? BV holds the TM, not trampa. And you can't write BV's name on your product not because trampa stole that right from you but because BV decided that you cannot put HIS name on YOUR stuff. Nothing else changed. 

Everybody gets butthurt because BV owes the community and should give something to it, not to trampa. But the reality is that he keeps giving everything to the community except the right to use his name. This is the only thing he gave to trampa. You are still allowed to use his design, produce it, sell it, modify it. Just put your own f****** name and be happy about this gift. If you make your own awesome ESC you can give the right to use your trademark to a company that you like better.

Your point makes sense - you're saying VESC is so generic that it shouldn't be trademarked. This actually would be a way to legally challenge the TM. It should be mentioned during the trademark process the USPTO does actually test for this so to them it passed muster. To me I would say "ESC" is definitely in "shoe" territory and the VESC... not so much, but this is just me shooting from the hip.

Really? Vesc is pretty specific for the project and the soft- and hardware designs it outputs. To proof that something is generic, you need to go e.g. to a supermarket and randomly ask 50-100 people. VESC what? Is pretty likely the answer you will get. 
Go to a model plain airfield and ask again. VESC what? What is it? Ask here in the Forum. VESC: The Benjamin Vedder ESC is probably the answer. Very specific!

When I buy a speed controller for an electric skateboard I usually yell at @oriol360 or @torqueboards and say "hey dude, I need a VESC".

I say "Hey, wheres the milk?".

Even the TM on the acronym VESC would be acceptable if he had just said "In 6 months we are gonna start selling the VESC6, the term acronym VESC is trademarked now, so by that point ya'll need to be calling it something else".  What he DID do is tell people with product on the shelves that they had to change the name immediately "because its good for Benjamin".

It's all just bullshit rhetoric with him.  I don't even really care on a personal level, I don't manufacture VESC's, I don't sell VESC's, I just like building powered boards and I do it for free.

You could still say I need a VESC! The vendor would reply: I habe a nice VESC based Controller for you. 

We can start talking about Linux here and arduino. And yesterday I bought a nice pair of addidas trainers. My apple computer just gave up and my BMW got scratched the other day. I'm wearing a levis jeans and @Kaly  sells a battery enclosure for a Trampa carveboard. Ollins motors are pretty fancy and I like @esk8 micro 2.4 ghz remote.
The VESC-Tool is amazing and there is even one, specially branded for vendor xyz available. It even shows the VESC TM big and fat top left. 
My controller runs the VESC-Firmware without anny efforts. Just download VESC-Tool here and upload the firmware.
Everything is possible! You can talk VESC as a vendor, you can explain the comparability to VESC. All you need to do is use the TM fair, as stated in the TM policies.

I have refrained from mentioning that in Shenzhen they wont give a damn about the Trampas trademark.  I hope no one is actually depending on encrypted firmware/software to keep counterfeits from being manufactured and sold.  I guarantee within 4 weeks of Trampas VESC6 release there will be a chinese version for the half the price, and if Frank's understanding of engineering is as bad as his public relation skills, probably twice as good..

Thats where we disagree.  I think most off-the-street people that are venturing into powered board building will have done at least a little reading and will be asking or a VESC.  That means they will get the Trampa VESC instead of a VESC-X or any other variant.  I may be wrong, but I don't think so.

It's still the Vedders Trademarks and I personally give a fuck about cheap stuff from China. Our customers do the same. I'm not interested in customers turning over every coin twice, shopping on Alibaba. If you want one, you are willing to pay for it.  People buy our products because they love them and they know they can pass over the board to their grand children. If you think the VESC SIX is poorly designed, you should also say that straight into Benjamins face who also gives a dam about low spec stuff. He has his own forum, to keep discussion technical and focused on relevant matters.

How I feel right now. So I built an app I named the VESC Status, because regardless of your make or model, it will work with any vesc, giving the important status information. Hence the name, VESC Status. It describes what it does. I don't sell VESCs, and other than using brand awareness, which I have contributed to build, along with onloop and chaka and many others. Why is it fair for you to sweep along, and tell us we can now longer actually describe our products in our name?

As a Software Engineer, I can tell you theres easy solutions to prevent malware that don't involve a TM, which is useless to stop bad actors, so please stop throwing that excuse around. That's like saying because Microsoft has a TM on Windows, that theres no versions of windows floating around there with malware on them... I could link you to a dozen torrents with malwared copies of windows right now if you'd like...

So here's my question for you. My product is currently named VESC Status, which is an iphone app that logs users data while they ride. In the near future, you will be able to modify settings also, all from your iphone. My website is of course named vescstatus.com, for obvious reasons. What do I need to do to comply with this new TM? If your solution involves me getting a new domain name, are you guys prepared to compensate me for a domain name which has already been paid for for the next 5 years, which at the time of registering, was not TM?

As a Software Engineer who is working with these firmwares to extract and send data to and from the VESC, one thing I can't fathom, is why there was ever multiple versions of the tool? Theres a thing called a switch statement, that does different things based on a variable, like the firmware version. I get different firmware versions have different variables ect. But it's 5x more work to create a new tool for every firmware version, then to have 1 tools for all fw versions...

This is something I'm dealing with now as I'm working on reading data in. My solution is as simple as I described above... One connection is established, I check the firmware version, and I have different objects for different firmware versions. We decide which object to use based on the firmware version, and not you support them all...

Hi evoheyax, that is a prime example of TM clashing. VESC means source is Benjamin. The brand can't be used for your App with that specific naming I guess. I can see your problem and a solution working for both, you and Ben, needs to be debated and agreed on. That needs to be debated on an individual basis.
So best option is send me a pm with your email, so that I can create a mail to you and Benjamin concerning your matter. The TM doesn't exist to block someone like you from offering a good service, but to make sure an uninformed customer can separate between your work and the one from Benjamin.
How the matter can be solved needs to be solved fast in your interest.

I think while developing its a lot easier to just code the tool for the newest firmware than having all into one project. Just copy your last project and add/delete the lines that have changed. Afterwards coding an app is a hole different story. But while developing the VESC-tool/firmware it is a lot easier to go that way.

Maybe you check your data again. As far as I can tell you registered it on 2017-01-19 and it ends on 2018-01-19. Thats one year instead of five and the TM was already known by this data. :blush: I totally understand your problem with the app/website, but I think there could be a solution found when you ask Benjamin friendly.

Wow - fun thread.  

First of all I've supported Ben since early 4.6 era hardware.  My first 4 VESC's were direct from him.  I've also donated >$200 to ben directly from donations, and split profits for some of his Vedder/Fechter anti-spark switches.  I only mention this to highlight that i firmly believe in compensating his hard work, and giving him the due $ to help him continue to innovate and create such amazing ESC's for our community (and bikes, and robots, etc. etc.)

Everyone w/ their panties in a knot.  I get some of your frustration w/ a "large" (i'm sure @trampa will laugh at that) company coming in and "enforcing" Ben's TM.  But it's to protect Ben who's given us a huge amount of his time - and i'd challenge most users have never contributed a cent to help him continue.

I saw a few VESC sites pop up and thought that was a bit shady, since i knew they weren't Ben's.  That to me is capitalizing on his hard work.  And being a glass if half full kinda guy - i hope they were kicking some $ Ben's way in thanks... but since Ben needed to go this direction to protect his name and reputation - i'd guess not.

I really like what i'm hearing about VESC 6.  I have a pair on order from Trampa.  And as soon as they are fully released OS - i'm excited to see what @Chaka does to tweak and refine it like he did with the original 4.xx VESC.  And if he can't get some sort of approval from Ben for using VESC - i'll buy the one that says "Ollin ESC v6.xx - based on VESC(TM) by Benjamin Vedder" - because i *trust* Ollin's quality and ingenuity.

I've never purchased a Maytech VESC.  I asked a direct fet version vendor on ebay what their % to Ben was and when they didn't respond - i didn't buy it!  Credit and $$ should go to Ben for his hard work.  I will buy v6 from Trampa as it refines (at a premium), or a v6 based on reference designs from one of the other Reputable/Trusted sources regardless if it says VESC or "electro gogo" (my choice @longhairedboy). 

I think there will quickly be a market for v6 electro gogo ESC's that are less expensive than the Trampa VESC 6.  Let them compete and i know the forum here will test and let us know which are worth the $!  Even if i buy the electro gogo ESC - i continue to send a few $ Ben's way as i can.  Gotta respect his contribution and support him so he can continue to make esk8 better for everyone.

Also looking forward to @raphaelchang's ESC - good to have options and can't wait to see his ESC/BMS options for the community!

My opinion, I think it's good that BV trademarked the VESC. Why, you may be wondering? There's too many crooked, greedy people out there willing to screw everyone else over the almighty dollar, both companies and consumers alike, and as esk8 is growing and at some point will start gaining a large amount of traction outside of it's niche community, he needs something to protect himself against the inevitable ( I highly doubt ANYONE here will go after BV. Just saying the average consumer who didn't do the proper research and just went out and bought the cheapest parts they came across and slapped everything together thinking it'll work without a hitch and something blows.).

This community greatly appreciates what BV has done and will do in the future, but what some of us don't appreciate is how you, @trampa, has handled it. And you still refuse to admit you mishandled the situation and instead you keep deferring any misgivings towards BV, not you. It's as if you are purposely trying to create an antagonistic relationship between the esk8 community and BV, and I surely hope you aren't because that's just low.

Though, I have to ask, are you planning a career in politics at some point @trampa? Because after reading this entire thread, your answers sound like it came from an arrogant politician, not a honest, humble hard-working businessman.

I look at this way. Dude needs to make money. We all got mouths to feed. Can't blame anyone for that. 

If you hit up Torqueboards and ask for a VESC, you will still get what you need. It's sort of like going to Staples and saying you need a Xerox machine. They'll show you copiers from a variety of manufacturers. That won't change unless the name VESC goes out of fashion. Frank already said that BV hasn't enforced the TM yet, so it's not like people can't keep selling product they have on their shelves as VESC's. I think his point is that anyone currently selling VESC's should stop working on promoting the name VESC and work on their own brand, so at which point BV decides to enforce the TM, you won't be left in a bad situation. 

It's not like we're talking about large companies who are hiring expensive PR firms to deal with these announcement and transitions. We're talking small business owners doing it themselves for the first time. There's no PR rep combing through every post before send is hit. You can't expect everything to be done perfectly, just as none of us expected our first stab at a DIY board to come out perfect.

Ok.  I've spent enough time reading the thread to see where the spin is going.  My earlier views still stand.

@Trampa, you seem to either not understand the minutia of the *real* concerns here or you are blatantly trying to manipulate the picture.

The community has literal blood, sweat, and tears in the maturing VESC.  It is universally known by the this moniker.  You have made a deal to be the sole proprietor of a 'VESC'.  There is a trust bound to this name as quality.  This cannot be argued.  We have all spoken of BV with great respect.  You also cannot argue the point of bad VESC's in the market giving 'VESC' a bad name.  This would have already happened if it were the case.  What does happen is the subpar company is blacklisted.

Now, back to you.  You have taken the role of champion, but no one asked you to.  If you had begun this as an open discussion, it would have been seen as worthy of support.  What is smacks of now, and ever will, is greed on your part to control a burgeoning market.  One poised to explode.

You have had ample time to clarify your stance.  Your posts continue to spin the protection of TM's for Ben.  Gosh, that's nice of you.  Why spend all the $$$?  What do you get in return?  Sole proprietorship of the VESC name!

This tactic has been used in several other industries.  In my trade, software engineering, it is called FUD (fear, uncertainty, and deception).  Microsoft used it against and example you used earlier in the thread-- Linux.

A patent(?) lawyer made and earlier comment I agree with.  VESC is already universally known and used.  Good luck with litigating that one.

I'll vote with my $$$.  I won't be rude, but I have lost faith in your company on how this has played out...

I must hav emissed that, but you should talk to the guys at esk8.de, @torqueboards, @onloop, etc.   about whether Frank has enforced the TM yet.

Dude, I don't even expect it to be done with a modicum of skill.  What I DO expect is for it to NOT be OK for someone to come in and take over a community built resource, stop other people from making them and selling them and then bitch and whine because we didn't thank him for it.

I totally understand about giving people the benefit of the doubt, seeing the best intentions in people...but there are no good intentions here.  Frank is putting other people out of business to increase his profit margin on a product he didnt help build.  He has essentially stolen it.

All I know is what he's said so far in these posts. It was one of his earlier posts where he said that BV isn't enforcing anything yet. Not really interested in doing any more research. 

Yes, I agree that it kind of sucks that other people are going to have some hurdles because they've been producing "VESC's", and now have to change that name to "XXXX based on VESC". Now that there are expectations, people are understandably upset, but I would hope that BV and Trampa will deal with the transition in a way that has as little negative impact on vendors that are going to have to deal with the name change. More for their sake than anyone else's. We don't need any more drama in esk8. 

In the end, we all benefitted a lot from the VESC, and without the work of BV, there'd be no VESC.

Not my point. Trampa orchestrated this all behind closed doors, not allowing these quality builders even a seat at the table. 

Btw, if you read between the lines, the 'next generation' software will cost and be licensed.  Just sayin. I don't think that will necessarily be bad, unless it only works with a Trampa VESC. 

Not trying to start conspiracy theories but most all of us here didn't take up this hobby as a commercial endeavor. We can afford expensive boards. It is the community and open embrace of innovation and the coolness factor.

I think onloop said it best yesterday, and that's that we know the lack of morality and what's happened, but theres not a lot we can do about. It's best to so degree to just move on, come up with a new name, and run with it. We've lost some of it now, but I think theres enough software engineers in this community to work on the software aspect of things that we could write our own firmwares together as a community if need be.

If you don;'t like it, like me, don't buy from trampa anymore, simple as that...

Hey,
i want to make clear why i'm no longer offering the vesc repair service. (lp-electronic.com)

I am not okay how trampa and BV began a cooperation behind closed doors. It is simply the way how they did. I'm okay with Ben having a trademark. He has to pay rent and make a living, too. Too many companies just used his design and produced/selled units without him getting anything. (I think this is unethical)
It's just now the community gets fucked because like some ppl here already pointed out: every resource, howto, addons, tips and tweaks point to the term "VESC" which is now "owned" by Trampa. This is not how open source works in my mind.
Then i'm wondering why Ben is not releasing any SW Updates in his Github Account? His last statement is "because of security reasons" and that he don't want to deliver something unfinished to reduce questions.
This behaviour is new and only since the coop with Trampa. Before that he regulary released firmwares and everything he had without any doubts even unfinished PCB were available. There was a Bug (max ramp step) in the Firmware. No Problem! Someone found it, pointed out and bam! Fixed.
I think (this is my personal opinion) that Trampa wants to get an advance with their VESC and the new Firmware. Other Vendors will get the Software "some time" later when the reference design is finished. It's okay, it is BV property and his right. I'm not complaining. I am just sad.
Other vendors do not get the new FW right now, one side of the medal. On the other hand i believe many open source contributors (like myself) can not add new features to the current firmware. An example: I want to add a Pedelec feature the VESC. I started with this quite some time ago and it is 40% done. I'm not doing anything now on the code because if Ben releases his new version i probably have to redo all my changes. I would like to have the current development branch of his Software in the Github repo. @ frank: Like Mozilla has (you compared vesc to Mozilla in this thread)

I offered the Repair Service to give something back to this community. I do not make a living out of if. (My Dayjob is Software Development). Example: Repair fee is 42€ - 19% Taxes, minus all the other things like tax adviser, rent for my office, electricity, paper, ink, labels, tools and so on. I usually spend between 30 - 80 minutes for a single Vesc. (incl unboxing, diagnosis, repair, packaging back, printing shipping label and creating a invoice). 

Lets just find a new name and forget about the term "VESC". Hopefully at some time the project will be released open source again.

Mate, nothing will go funny! Benjamin wants BETA and will release after that for a very good reason. Its a complete restart of the project, everything is new. 100% new code is quite a job. VESC is an entire environment now, a lot bigger than BLDC-Tool. We are no longer talking about a stand alone software with firmware distributed separately. Everything is a bit more complicated and needs the time! Benjamin has the VESC-server just up and running. Glass fiber cables need to be buried in the garden... 

Everyone wants to use the VESC-Brand, Benjamin doesn't want that. It was his decision, please respect that. Code and HW will be OS, that is a gift. I have the feeling whenever something is for free, people 
can't get enough.

Arduino is OS and they have a Trademark and sell original hardware. Super unethical...
Get real! 

If Benjamin and I wouldn't have met, you guys would have not seen a fresh VESC-Project restart with 100% new software and hardware. Things change, that's life. 

In the end everyone will love all the new stuff, despite the fact that some Trampa is in it. Some people inspire each other and then things suddenly start to happen, that would not have happened otherwise.

Feel like we are going in circles... but my last comment on the "trampa is screwing us" theme.

Ben is a smart guy.  An adult.  Capable of making his own decisions.  If he didn't reach out to you _personally_ to discuss this - so what?  Why would he need to check in with you?!  He made a choice to partner with Trampa.  Again- so what?  If you meet someone and have similar passions/interests and just sync up - you want to work with them!  Seriously - who is anyone besides Ben to say who he should or shouldn't work with?

And anyone can continue to make a VESC 4.xx (until v6 is reference is released OS) - they simply need to rename it to their own "brand" and "based on VESC(tm) by Benjamin Vedder".  Seems pretty reasonable.

And let's think why he needed to go this route...  Besides the shady websites VESC.xx.xx , there's also the Maytech POS VESC that is touting "Benjamin Vedder VESC!".  That's BS.  And looking at banggood it's not appreciably cheaper than a more reputable seller like Enertion/DIYes/Chaka.  Folks will buy and have issues and think VESC is junk.  This does reflect on Ben.  I totally understand him wanting to stop this and protect his name and invention's reputation.

And to be greedy - if this partnership and help from Trampa helped speed up development and release of v6 - SWEET!  I agree it's at a premium right now - but it should come down in price with some competition.  Reference designs - called whatever - still like "electro gogo" - will be soon available from folks you likely trust like @Chaka and Enertion.  W/ their own "brand" but running a reference or remixed hardware design.  Perhaps Ben will have some sort of licensing option for those larger volume manufacturers to label them still as VESC.  LIkely at some cost (justifiably so to recompense Ben's hard work), but if you want it some $ should go to ben - even if "electro gogo".

@Trampa - my only question w/ those remixed hardware or straight reference design - will we all be able to use the new VESC tool?  That looks so much better than the old BLDC tool.

If you can't see that Ben's work has been capitalized on by others - offering some sub-par "VESC"'s, and making associations as if they were w/ Ben w/o any compensation to ben - i think you are being intentionally obtuse.

Name *your VESC* whatever you want!  We'll find it if it works well or is a value vs the Trampa offering.  Maybe rename it to:
[img]https://1.bp.blogspot.com/_SQtVbfslHI4/TDYTzxXRGpI/AAAAAAAAAEQ/gX8z6o5wuAA/s1600/prince-logo.jpg[/img] 
"based on VESC(tm) by Benjamin Vedder"

If you truly feel you helped "create" the VESC by reporting bugs and minor feedback like that - i think you are overvaluing your input.  Look at the software as that is doing the heavy lifting, not the hardware.  Now some folks like @chaka, DIYes, Enertion, and  @Ackmaniac have definitely helped with moving it forward - by offering effectively their own variant of VESC (VESC-X, Direct FED from chaka) and custom firmware from @Ackmaniac!  Pretty great contributions, but look at it from a total percentage of the effort by Ben - and still using the software config tool BLDC and now VESC tool...  a contribution for sure, but nothing compared to the effort from Ben.  

Get un-butthurt about Ben wanting to protect his reputation and IP.  He's chosen who he wants to work with on the next version.  I don't know @Trampa from adam... but i appreciate the time/effort/money he's invested to help Ben.  Didn't seem like anyone else was stepping up and helping support him to make v6 happen.  Did he "buy" the VESC - no.  It still belongs to Ben and not Trampa.  Yes Trampa is likely recouping some $ w/ v6 prices.  I think that's reasonable, and we always have the option to continue buying 4.xx VESCs elsewhere.  And ultimately when the reference v6 is released i'm looking forward to seeing how folks re-mix or produce it and how it compares.

it's a polarizing topic - i'm sure several disagree.  I do feel like Frank has done an admirable job of at least communicating and being receptive here, while not losing his cool from some pretty harsh criticism.  Talking in circles a bit - sure but you can only answer the same question the same time before it's a bit repetitive.

Until this is fully released we're speculating and getting worked up about some things that aren't known yet.  Licensing costs - software (new VESC tool) availability and free or cost?, and reference design details.  I'm hoping it's like 4.12 currently w/ the PCB's that folks can re-flow themselves, and then figure out heatsinks to make it work for their expected need...

I'll leave it at that for now and try to avoid getting pulled in again.  My 2 pence...

Good write up mate! No locks no nothing BTW. Fully OS! 

Vesc-Tool and Vesc-six would not have happened without Ben and Frank banging on it. It was simply to much work to be dealt with by one person after work. So Benjamin did what he could and I did what I could. Two brains banging on stuff also generates inspiration and it helps to push each other to another level. It was fruitful so far.

There is a good portion of Trampa in the stuff. Two brains simply output more ideas. It's good that my windings work a bit differently than Benjamins. That helps to think into more different directions. 
It wasn't achieved by throwing cash on the table. It wad achieved by working hard and with endurance.

Benjamin and I share the same quality ethos and perfectionism. Ben is probably a bit more crazy than I am, quality wise. 

In the end everyone will love to make business on selling the new stuff that would not have existed without the steps that have been taken. No VESC SIX, no VESC-Tool.

Everything will get served on a polished silver plate, ready to be eaten. It would be nice to leave some food for Benjamin! 
I have the fealing that a lot of vendors and manufacturers are a bit frustrated because now they can't have it all anymore - the R&D, the Soft and hardware plus the Vedder brand. I think its fair to leave him the brand. He can do with the brand whatever he wants. One decision was to output hardware with us under that brand. Probably because we both worked hard on the stuff. Got it?

You have a good eye to see things! 
Things were not balanced correctly.
No one needs to send donations btw. But exploiting the project name and not shooting anything back is a bit funny in my eyes.
I have the feeling the community thinks it own the project, so there is no need for kickbacks.
Some few gave, the majority took what it could get, that is the sad truth. 
Most didn't even send a card for Christmas.
Hallelujah!
The past is past now. Time for a restart. 
Some probably didn't realize that something was funny. I can understand that, we are all hyped by e-boarding and male. Please rethink your position in future. Drop some R&D on top and forward it to Benjamin. 
If you do so, something will be given back to you. In the end its a win win thing. Better funding, better and more products, better for sales, better for the customer, better for the community, bigger community, more sales.

Right on @sl33py

@mmaner and who has been donating to Ben? obviously it wasn't sustainable living on goodwill donations from the handful of vendors who actually donated. I bet you would cry foul and spruke how "Ben sold out" if he decided to go work for boosted/evolve or a future electric vehicle company.

Ben's decision to work with whom he wants. Think about it. He's a grown man for fucks sake. Trampa hasn't seriously got him on their evil island volcano lair dangling his feet into the pit to make him sign over all his intellectual property from now til hell freezes over - I just made that shit up.

This thread is pretty out of control with some of bashing towards Trampa, and they seem to take it a lot better than others have in the past.

This is how I see it put simply:
Too much **_shit_** was being made and having the same name **_VESC_** put on it. All this does is make the uninformed user buy the crap which is also likely not to result in any form of donation to Ben V. at all because it's either the cheaper option or the most spoken about option.

Any of the vendors complaining they have to change the name as a result I challenge the following:
Talk to ben about licensing
Show that you have actually donated regularly to Ben in the past
Your product is up to _standard_

Like Frank said, you could easily fit those that contribute to ben financially in a small car.
Those that already have, that I know of that also have high standard hardware are likely to easily obtain a license from him to continue using the VESC name.

Lastly I'd like to know why this has become an issue now and not when it was first discussed (that I saw) quite some time ago in the VESC6 thread?

I'm not @Trampa, but i do see a couple really solid issues that were there, and it seems like Frank stepped up to help.

1. What does this action do for the community - speed up release of v6 and make it available now vs vaporware (if you've been following since 4.12 - v5 - v6 it was perpetually "soon!").  Ben is only one guy and doing it in his spare time is shown with delays and every video and forum update was just time taken away from building/testing v6.

2. Why was this action taken - BECAUSE BEN NEEDED THE HELP.  Again he chose this, he was not and should not be expected to "check in" with the forum before he decides what to do with *his IP*.  The problem was clearly that everyone was taking VESC and Ben's name and using it to sell VESCs.  Some disreputable folks in particular took pains to appear as if they were Ben, and some sold VESC's that are clearly sub-par.  Impacting Ben's hardware/software credibility and reputation.  Trampa looks to have helped with sorting out a likely convoluted process to get his tm, connected him with resources to make that happen, and helped offset costs to travel to do this, and free up his time to focus on *building* the new v6 and more importantly VESC tool (have you seen how much better it will be!?).  Resources and help seem to be the easiest answer.

[quote="mmaner, post:333, topic:23017"]
I just want everyone to look at this thread, think about the ramifications of this action.  This is the moment when your hobby/passion/whatever gets hijacked.  This is the moment when you can actually say something about the way greed turns a community upside down and perverts it for the sake of profit...right now.[/quote]

Agreed!  Folks were selling on Ben's name and his reputation without helping him fund or move v6 forward.  a TM seems a logical protection from this abusive greed by everyone who isn't Ben.  Capitalism/greed - call it what you want.  I agree some vendors and repair folks are likely in a pinch.  BUT there looks to be a clear process to keep doing what they are doing - build your 4.1x VESC w/ your own name, until v6 reference is released and do the same.  We'll find the good ones and support them - hopefully increasing competition w/ Trampa's more expensive offering.  Ben has always seemed a reasonable guy, so if you have a VESC named solution - chat with him!  I'm sure you'll work something out reasonably.

[quote="mmaner, post:333, topic:23017"]
I have never maid a single cent of this thing we call powered skateboards,  eskate, or esk8, whatever you want to call it, I do it because I love it.  I've done all I can to try open your eyes to type of person that Frank is, regardless I am done, its taken the fun out of this for me.
[/quote]

_Seriously?!_  I get your passion, but this seems a bit over-the-top.  An *Electric Speed Controller* has taken the fun out of one of your loves?  How sad.  Use another ESC and go RIDE FFS!  Do you have a similar reaction when your favorite restaurant's desert is gone and you have to pick another - never going back to that "horrible restaurant!" again?

Again the frustration with the evil Frank, but Ben is a saint?  He's the authority here - he chose this path.  And for some pretty compelling reasons it seems to me.  He didn't sell his IP to boosted or any other number of board makers - he's just selling the early release through a buddy he likes working with.  Still OS, and not stopping *ANYONE* from making a VESC with their own name on it and due credit to his project.  Keep making your own VESC's.  Ollin already has, Enertion has, and i expect MEB, DIYes, and others to do this as it's not that much of a hurdle to keep providing to the community.

What is wrong with making a couple bucks doing what you like.  So everyone should offer repair and hardware for zero cost for their time?  I sold spare anti-spark switches and made enough to get my first real reflow oven - does that make me a bad guy and less passionate about esk8?  I think the biggest difference is i split profits with Ben to help fund his innovation - unlike a lot of others.

This thread is like a train-wreck.  Cannot help but watch in fascination...  Painful as it is, I keep getting pulled in.

Lastly - i respect you @mmaner.  I've seen your contributions to the forum, and helping folks repeatedly.  I respect your passion and point of view.  I just disagree with the underlying sense of entitlement - that Ben should've gotten the community or builders "blessing" before doing what he wants, and that it's evil to protect his name and reputation, let alone to setup a structure that gives enough $ back to him to help fund his passion and innovation moving forward.  

I hope that helps some people see the flip side of the coin, in the absence of Ben commenting directly, and maybe moderates the "trampa is evil" theme.  Don't buy Trampa VESC 6 - wait for ref design and get it from your friendly vendor of choice!  I still see it as a means to speed v6 release, and worth the premium.  Can't wait for my v6 betas to arrive and compare!

my .02 take it as you like.

I'm not @Trampa
[/quote]

That is correct, we are all interested in hearing what Frank says to say about this but he refuses.  I think he is refusing because he knows the truth makes him look very bad.

I started to make this long reply explaining every point you made and why I feel it is incorrect, but I don't think you care.  It feels like you have sided with Frank for some reason and your interest is to shoot down anyone saying something that doesn't flatter him.  

Here are the facts.

1.  Trampa tells every US & European manufacturer that they can no longer sell the VESC as a VESC.  This does not effect the Chinese Manufacturers, as there is very little enforcement or penalty restrictions regarding US/UK Copyrights and/or Trademarks.
2.  Trampa has the sole manufacturing rights & data for the VESC6, but has not released the VESC6 for sale but is still creating a situation where it is difficult, maybe impossible to purchase a VESC4 or 6, in the short term.
3.  All of this was done in secret.
4.  The vendors in this community have ALL donated money to BV, as near s I can tell.  Saying the 'people' have not requires some numbers and facts to be a valid argument.  The vendors that have not donated the BV are specifically chinese manufacturers, this action doesn't do anything to hurt them.

If you can defend these points you need a career in politics.  To me, it make Frank look like a greedy opportunist.  The fact that he will not answer ANY questions regarding the VESC6 situation, further enforces that conclusion.  Frankly if BV is supporting this, then he is at fault here as well.  

Obviously no one is against profits, there wouldn't be an industry centered on powered boards if there was.  To say is just more rhetoric.

[quote="sl33py, post:335, topic:23017"]

I'm just gonna call that more rhetoric, because this isn't about me at all and that is obvious to any 1st grader on the planet.  FFS.  If you are happy watching the people that built this community be taken advantage of, then good luck to you.

Like I said, I'm done with this, i've done all I can and that apparently pisses people like you off.  Who the hell knows why.  Regardless have a good time, do what you do.

Legislation is a fact that you can't overlook. The Vesc-Project is growing up and stuff needs to get sorted better now than never. 
We are a small company mate, I have enough work on my desk already and sorting out all the stuff for the Project, that outputs all the software you guys need for riding your boards is no big fun. It's endless effort on top of my daily job. 
If I count my hours spent + the costs for Project support, we got to sell a lot of VESCs to get a financial kickback. 
That's our disadvantage btw. Other vendors didn't have these cost and will not price them in. I'm not interested to go crazy on sales. It's all hard work and we manly run the business because we love our products and the social network that is attached to the Brand, not for the money. Maybe that's why Benjamin wants to output the HW through us. He is not money driven, we are not money driven. 
If you are after money, you better not sell a product like ours, causing many questions and needing lots of customer support. 
Selling custom boards is quite a lot of work.
One product fits all, made in china is a lot more easy.

The software is OS BTW, so nothing will change really. There is no way to keep bureaucracy away from a OS-Project. Better stuff gets sorted out now, once and for forever, then messing around for forever. 

It's not a drastic change btw. It's purely the brand that is in Benjamins hands now.
If people don't like that we helped to make things happen, fine. If people think we shouldn't use the VESC brand for the official HW release, fine. It would be a bit funny though, naming the official HW release other than VESC. Someone has to make the official HW happening. If its not us, its someone else. It's better someone like us, believe me. You have to trust Benjamins decision on that, he is not stupid.

There were exactly two options: Dropping the project, or doing it properly. 
The second option is probably better for the community but means some stuff changes slightly.
Everyone believing things were just fine and should have continued as they were: That was no option for the VESC-Project. A project needs to be sustainable to be carried on. Without a TM and funding you can't sustain a project and in consequence it will be dead one day. A dead VESC-Project is not in the interest of the community.

My advice: Look at both sides of the coin.

Frank

Thanks to mmanner for his strong words!
I've been thinking for a long time
Whether I should post this
I do not care if I have to change the name of the Vesc
The people who bought me
Know very well that they bought made in Germany
Quality and not quantity
I did not care the cost of the production.
I had the choice germany = expensive or china = cheap
I have looked for Germany and quality.
I can remember that Trampa has bought Vesc from us
Since I was told that I want too much money for a Vesc
Trampa can build it for $ 50
We have told Trampa ok no problem
try it
And now there are only two options for Trampa
Drop
Or make it right.
Yes to make it right
All the Vesc sell prohibit vesc for sale
Then I can cost $ 100 for a product
Equal to three times as much
Yes, then I do everything right
Fill my pockets
At the expense of the Community
We paid for the Vesc 4.12 in the production 92.- €
We sold the Vesc 4.12 for 149.- €
We bakamen only the Elko board and the Vesc PCB
without cable
We have the Vesc 4.12 programmed and the cables soldered
The whole lasted over a 1/2 hour
We packed it and sent it to post office
If I calculate everything at tax and costs
Stayed for each Vesc 20.- €
Of this, we gave BV 10%
We put our cards on the table!
We get for our work at Vesc
And for responsibility 18.- €
Yes, we have become rich
And drive VW Polo

Hey @Mmaner - i enjoy a good discussion, so i'm not hurt we don't see eye to eye on this.  I think we've both helped folks and likely would get along fine in most settings chatting esk8 or a beer after a ride!

Agreed - nothing stopping Maytech or other chinese clones from selling rubbish.  Hopefully it'll be apparent soon that those are junk compared to the offerings from reputable vendors like @Chaka, Enertion, DIYes, etc. etc.

Also agreed - that's called good business.  He invested and put his money on the table to help v6 become a reality.  F'ing KUDOS!  Is it expensive - hell yes!  Hopefully v6 ref design from others will be less $ and easier for us to afford.  v4.xx is still an option though, so i am missing how this is actually impacting ANYONE from getting 4.12 VESC from [DIYes (still available and only $100)](diy-electric-skateboard-kits-parts/vesc-the-best-electric-skateboard-esc/), or [VESC-X/FOCBOX from Enertion](http://www.enertionboards.com/electric-skateboard-parts/vesc-x-programmable-brushless-motor-controller/) (~$150), [Ollin Board Co v4.12](http://www.ollinboardcompany.com/product/vedder-s-speed-controller) (~$150-165) - they are still available, and not going to be scarce if those vendors are smart.  Until v6 and then i expect we'll get their version of v6 to pick from as well!  Competition is good for us!

[quote="mmaner, post:336, topic:23017"]

**_THIS._**  This is where a sense of entitlement rears it's head in my view.  _Ben chose to do this._  It is _his creation_.  _His time_.  **His money**.  And his extraordinary efforts to bring it to us.  A sense that he needed to, or should've, discussed it with anyone is ridiculous.  Instead of "thank you" i hear "why didn't you let me know first" - to what end?  **Do you feel like you've contributed enough to have a voice - time coding, $ donated, or what tangible contribution to have a say in what he does with his Intellectual Property?**

This is your FACTS?  That seems like an assumption - and one that might be true for some vendors, but absolutely not all.  
I agree it won't impact the chinese companies - but the first step is tm, then he can at least attempt to curb the use of his name and VESC.  Inexperienced users will still buy them, but hopefully when they search they find this forum and we help them steer clear, or towards alternatives in their budget range.

Eliminate "greedy" and i think that's an accurate statement.  A smart business man is quick to act on opportunity.  If he spoke with Ben and they had a good feel for working with eachother - great.  And if the support of Trampa brough the v6 to market *significantly* sooner than without - that's my definition of win-win.

[/quote]
Glad to see you agree that this is Ben's choice - good or bad according to our opinions.  I've seen Frank answer a majority of questions.  Some likely are depending on more detail being released from Ben.

v6 - OS and ref design "soon".
VESC tool - free to use still.
Rename your VESC to your own brand and keep on selling them as-is.  No impact, other than an inconvenience to rename and re-brand pcb's on your next batch.  Sharpie in the meantime adequate to black-out VESC.  Stupid simple.

I've never been accused of being able to do politics - i'm usually far too blunt to placate folks and tell them what they want to hear vs my perception of reality.  

[quote="mmaner, post:336, topic:23017"]If you are happy watching the people that built this community be taken advantage of, then good luck to you.[/quote]

AGAIN - why should anyone besides Ben have a say what is done with his IP?  We can still buy 4.12 from the vendors linked above (some improved like Direct FET from Enertion and Chaka) - who cares if it says VESC or Purplebanannapowered - as long as it works.

Does VESC 6 sold by Trampa cost more - YES!  He's also splitting profits with Ben - so some of this "greed" is fueling and allowing Ben to continue building better and better ESC's!  OR one of his other projects (look at his github - guy does everything) - all work and no play sucks.  

It will adjust.  I can't wait to see reference design options, and "improved" options for specific needs from the smart folks here.  Titled whatever they desire.  

Can't wait to see what the future holds.  v6 now and more options sooner than when ben was trying to do it all on his own.

my .02

I truly hope you at least partly understand my point of view - as i feel i do yours.  Very few things in life are worth investing the stress and headache i'm seeing.  My opinion, and not saying it's not worth at least discussing and asking @Trampa to answer your questions.  Spell them out and ask for his response.  I think i probably got close, but it's worth hearing what his opinion is directly on your remaining questions.

Sad news: Benjamin broke is foot on Saturday. Guss how? Doing dangerous esc- research on an Evil twin drive 12S 7P, dual VESC SIX Trampa MTB, thrashing down the craters test track at ridiculous speed.
Just kidding: Tire exploded, worn out, couldn't wait for the parcel with new tires.
He thought the battery exploded and jumped off at speed. One foot got stuck, board spun the foot 270deg. FUCK!

Result:
Eight titanium kingpins in his right foot and leg. Just had a longer conversation with him. BETA is in no danger. He has his fingers on the keyboard already, slightly slowed down by a good portion of morphine, still faster than anyone else.

Do me all a favor and send him your best wishes through his forum!

Answers to @mmaner: 

_1.   Trampa tells every US & European manufacturer that they can no longer sell the VESC as a VESC. This does not effect the Chinese Manufacturers, as there is very little enforcement or penalty restrictions regarding US/UK Copyrights and/or Trademarks._

Not true, Benjamin has the TM in China and HK and things changed in China a bit. I pretty sure Jollin from Maytech will do a good job supporting the project, because she is not stupid and can see the benefits of product improvement. It will be no big disadvantage sending over a few bucks per VESC made, especially if you are granted benefits in return (e.g. showing up on  list of project supporters). I get quite well along with Chinese folks. Why should they not have the same chance than everyone else to show some respect? Customers have to judge on quality themselves, that is nothing the Project can do for them.

_2. Trampa has the sole manufacturing rights & data for the VESC6, but has not released the VESC6 for sale but is still creating a situation where it is difficult, maybe impossible to purchase a VESC4 or 6, in the short term._
_All of this was done in secret._

Sorry that Benjamin wants to run a BETA before the release. You can buy a VESC 4 at any time and it will still be produced or made in future, I'm sure. There is a transition phase from HW 4.xx to HW 6.xx and there is nothing you can do about it. Manufacturers have to start making it and get comfortable with the product first. A one day switch from 4 to 6 is not possible, nor good. Companies have stock and need to be able to sell that first.
We take our time to make sure everything is up to standard. The software will be released soon. I bet some manufacturers have a VESC 6 hardware design already in their backhand. The hardware is rather easy to make and can be pushed into the market fast. You want everything simultaneously, but Benjamin can't work on everything at the same time. Not enough man power.... Being seriously injured, I will not put pressure on him and the community should do the same.  Manufacturer will profit from the VESC 6 hype. If you sell it a month earlier or later, doesn't matter on the long run.  It's not a mater of being the first, it's a matter of having a good and sustainable product in the end. 

 _3.  The vendors in this community have ALL donated money to BV, as near s I can tell. Saying the 'people' have not requires some numbers and facts to be a valid argument. The vendors that have not donated the BV are specifically Chinese manufacturers, this action doesn't do anything to hurt them._

You are totally wrong here. I made a list of al VESC manufacturers and vendors and shared the info with Benjamin. He thought it were FOUR manufacturers, not 30 and something. I told you they all fit in a small car. There is no difference between china and the western world! China bashing is not my favourite hobby. If a Chinese factory does a good job, working hard: my respect. I judge by quality and customer support and project support. 
We will not expose who donated and who not. Let the past be the past and the future be the future. There were some few individuals donating some, not a brought mass of users. Ask Benjamin to confirm that. He will!
Current funding situation is far of what the Project deserves. 

With regards to "doing everything secretly": Just wasn't the case if you have a look at Benjamin's forum and this one.
TM stuff is known since it got registered in europe, VESC 6 development is documented on Bens forum and videos on Youtube. Everyone can ask questions at any time and will probably get an answer. Not everything requires a public opinion poll and Benjamin doesn't have to ask the community to make his decisions. He is not a supplicant to the community. 

Frank

Ps.. Sorry when not all questions can be answered instantly. You are many and Benjamin and I are two. Manpower again. You are accusing us to have fucked things up. Your opinion! I have plenty of feedback from people who believe that the steps that were taken were in favour of the project and the community. I'm not on this planet to make everything being perfect for everyone. It's imply not possible since opinions vary. Your point of view is different to Benjamins or @hexakopter or @racidon or @sl33py or @jebe or .... . That's the way it is. I would like to convince you that the steps we ( Benjamin and I) have taken were in favour of the Project and will not be an issue for other vendors on the long run.
They will still be found on Google, they will build up their own brands, they will have a better soft and hardware to sell.
The community will have a access to a way better product in future and hopefully the Project will get more funding to make more things happening. Benjamin and I had endless debates about the decisions that were made. Pros and cons have been debated, chances for vendors have been debated. Consumer issues have been debated etc, etc.
Personally I want to see the Project growing on solid foundations. We all can only have only a slice of the cake. A slice of a big cake is still more than a slice of a small cake. So there is probably no interest in cutting off other vendors.
VESC-Tool and VESC 6 is OS and a gift. Sorry that some Trampa is in it. I did my part of the job creating the new stuff.
Without that the thing would not have happened. That's the way it is, like it or not.

So there is no protection being offered by Tampa's involvement, only stopping others from selling, glad you agree.  90% of the people building boards already  know that the chinese VESC's for the most part are junk, so nothing achieved there either.

He secretly invested (said bought) his money at the expense of other builders, that is not good business.  How do you know the VESC 6 is gonna be so great.  Until he actually starts shipping there's no possible way you could know.  You might 'think' it will be but is that good enough to stop other sellers from selling?  I don't think so, I think its shitty behaviour.

I completely disagree.  He snuck in and negotiated a deal that has screwed everyone but him and MAYBE Ben.  If you ok with that kind of behaviour then fine, I am not and this is why.  This ain't a game of monopoly, there are consequences to starting this kind of action.  You will now see other vendors and developers be less likely to release anything new for fear that someone like Frank will snap it up and make it there own.  If nothing else, Frank has eroded the trust this community had in the vendors and manufacturers.

I'm just gonna put it out there.  If you know of a vendor who is part of this community and/or in the US/UK that has not donated to BV then call them out.  I don't think you can.  I think everyone of the VESC manufacturers that DID NOT donate the BV are either chinese or one-offs.  So, once again no protection offered by this action.

Rename your VESC to your own brand and keep on selling them as-is.  No impact, other than an inconvenience to rename and re-brand pcb's on your next batch.  Sharpie in the meantime adequate to black-out VESC.  Stupid simple.
[/quote]

o impact!  Are you serious?  If you have 200 VESC PCB's on the shelf waiting to sell...well now you have 200 paper weights because noone with any pride is gonna use a sharpie on them and sell them.  If it were me Id just keep selling them as is until they are gone.  If Frank doesn't like it he can file for a cease and desist.  I feel no need to treat people respectfully that haven't shown me the same courtesy and Frank has disrespected this entire community.

[quote="sl33py, post:342, topic:23017"]
It will adjust.
[/quote]

Yes it will, in the meantime availability will continue to go down until its difficult to find a VESC, many vendors will have lost a lot of money, all in the name of Frank lining his pockets.  I just don't see how you can be OK with that.  He has literally told every other vendor they cant sell anymore but he is not even selling them yet.  Its stupid.

You are so full of wild accusations mate! Unless you don't come up with an idea how things should have been handled and how VESC SIX or VESC-Tool could have been made possible without invest from the hardly existing funding, without someone taking care of the pile of undone work, your accusation are hollow at best. 
You have no clue how much work it was, nor how much invest it took, but you will like the new stuff for sure! 
VESC-Tool is a 100% restart of the Project, 100% new code! 
Its a fucking amazing piece of software that will bring a lot of boost into the market and under your feet. It's OS and magnitudes better than anything else out there. Put your negative attitude to the side and help to make it even better.
Because now its up to the community and vendors to build upon the new release. Forgive Benjamin if he will do stuff slower than usual, due to the very bad accident he had on Saturday. This will cause some delays no one wanted to happen.

I've never made wild accusations.  Ive asked what this does for the community and why you are uniquely suited to resolve the issues.  You have still, after 30 posts, not answered the questions.  You throw around rhetoric and Ben this and Ben that and dodge the questions.  Its comical at this point.

As far as accusations, I have accused you of being greedy and not supporting the community.  I prove these accusations bu the very fact you are using legal means to stop other sellers from selling stock they have on the shelves and that you took this action in secret.  Nothing wild about it, pretty damned straight forward.

[quote="trampa, post:352, topic:23017"]

Your right, none of use do because you have been secretive about this entire process.  You surprised everyone by taking away the right of others to sell using the VESC name, so they either have to trash the existing stock or use a Sharpie to mark it out (which is never gonna happen and is ridiculous to suggest).

One again, a ridiculous statement.  How in the world can you know what I will like and not like?  You don't, your just trying to sell us a bag of promises.

I honestly don't care who makes/sells VESC's anymore.  I am angry that you are trying to force others to change their business model to and costing them thousands of dollars for no other reason than your profit.  If you had sent a legit letter to all of the vendors and said...
_"In 90 days the VESC name will be off-limits ad you need to come up with your own name because we bought it"..._
I could have respected that, but you didn't.  You pit all this together and then sprung it on everyone.  I think its sleazy and greedy.  

[quote="trampa, post:352, topic:23017"]

I don't have anything against Ben, I think he made a bad decision by using someone like you who has no respect for the community and is only interested in profit...but legally that is his choice.

If you want to make this right, you should contact the VESC vendors in the UK and US that HAVE donated to Ben and tell them they have 90 or 120 days before you will enforce the trademark.  That would allow them to sell there existing stock and do a lot of good for the community by not potentially putting vendors out of business and keeping the price down and availability up.  Is that something you would be willing to do?

maybe impossible to purchase a VESC4 or 6, in the short term.
[/quote]

you can have one in about 3 weeks if you download the gerber files and upload them to marofab. Price starts dropping at 10 units. 

you can also buy them from AXLE. And Ollin. And DIY. And Miami. And even maytech if you don't care about anything over 10S. They simply won't be called VESC. They'll be called FOCBOX and OllinESC and Dexter's Magical Fun Box and Miami Heat or something who knows. Maytech will probably just call them VESCs and give everyone the finger unless we talk them out f it, (Jollin will listen if you speak her dialect of business) but who cares. 

I don't understand. If you think people like me aren't already doodling logos to have laser etched in thier new v6 the second those reference designs hit the market you're nuts. Hell even direct FET 4.12s in that form factor are worth the effort, as the X clearly demonstrated. 

Lets try not to skew facts in favor of argument and just stick to the simple concept of not liking all the closed doors and corporate optics from Trampa's direction.

I didn't come up with this storm here. TM is known since Jan 17.
Statement is out since May17, just before BETA starts. This storm just over rolled the official statement. 
Next week the vendors will get a longer e-mail from Benjamin.

http://vedder.se/forums/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=733

Renaming the thing on a website is no big deal and selling some existing stock is no big deal. If you want to conform fully, you black out the tiny VESC-Logo, job done. Doesn't cost you thousands. Costs you an hour of time and a marker pen. Next batch new logo. Doesn't put anyone out of business!

I'm just gonna put it out there.  If you know of a vendor who is part of this community and/or in the US/UK that has not donated to BV then call them out.  I don't think you can.  I think everyone of the VESC manufacturers that DID NOT donate the BV are either chinese or one-offs.

You ask to call them out, so I call out @onloop. I think he is the one that sold the most VESCs and didn't donate Benjamin any money. As he says himself he is "donating to the community".
[quote="onloop, post:52, topic:11265"]
Id say that most vesc vendors probably don't donate much if anything to vedder.  Which is a bit sad.. None of the Chinese factories will donate that's for sure.

Honestly, i focus my donations more towards the community..... I do it via offering my own open source wares, my motor mounts have been downloaded thousands of times by people all over the world.

Just read the following comments on this thread https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/i-am-anti-innovation-here-is-why/11265/47. When you read between the lines, Jason admit that he didn't donate to Benjamin.

I'm not scewing facts, I have talked to vendors that are upset that they may have issues selling PCB's on the shelf that say VESC.  If that wasn't an issue I wouldn't be upset, I would just think that Frank was greedy.

Vendors are in the situation where they cannot say what they think in public about Frank because is could effect there ability to get product.  I am not in that situation, so I decided to speak out.

That is your interpretation, not a fact.  This action was taken over the statement that vendors were not donating to Ben.

of course they're going to have issues. They can't call them VESCs and they've already stocked up a bunch of PCBs with VESC screen printed on them. I'd be mad too. Boo hoo. Like that time i bought a bunch of BMSs i couldn't fucking use and China wouldn't take them back. 

And i think the position they're in as far as feeling as if they can't talk shit about Frank is due to their general confusion of the issues while trying to stay diplomatic. They obviously aren't aware of the fact that what they have is a license to print money and all they have to do is come up with a logo that doesn't say VESC. 

Hell i'm a vendor and i'm on here talking shit. IF they feel they can't, they're pussies. 

Here's what I think is going to happen. Those people are going to have to make a VESC variant that actually holds up for more than a fucking week because they no longer have the VESC name to lean on.  No more VESC IS A VESC IS A VESC so lets buy the cheapest one from aliexpress and bitch about how its crap and burned up in a month after a couple hill climbs. Now they're buying Tommy Two Toes' Coil Commander that fell off a truck and has a deep discount and bitching about that one failing instead. Whammo, one less bad review on a VESC that was barely even a VESC and one less hit on Benjamin. 

Trampa will have the ability to use the VESC name and is using that to charge a massive premium for a massively premium product. That premium will be used to pay themselves back for the cost of doing everything they did. But that's not going to encourage all the people to buy Trampa VESCs and eliminate the entire market and cause a drought. That's going to encourage people with more money than time to research to buy Trampa VESCs out of an overwhelming sense of caution about not buying parts twice, a sense of caution they probably developed here while we beat that very thing into their head over the course of the past couple of years. The rest of the people are going to buy from the same damned vendors they always have, except now there's a different sticker on it. And they're going to keep bitching when they fail. 

Its almost as if... wait for it.. nothing has changed.

Unless this market is unlike every other market ever, I think you are going to see that isn't true in the long run.  

Look at the cost of insurance in the states, doubled over 5 years because the government wanted to make healthcare accessible to everyone.  Most of the people that didn't have it 5 years ago still don't have it but I pay twice as much for mine.  The benefit?  All for the insurance companies.

Look at Comcast & AT&T.  They provide shitty customer server, even shittier actual service.  The bump the prices, change the name, call it a day and go to sleep on big fat piles of cash.

I think this will have very little benefit to the community, Frank has demonstrated where his priorities are.  I don't think Ben is gonna get a huge windfall of cash from donations, there's going to me too much animosity over this crap.  I do think that availability is going to touchy for awhile.  None of this had to happen, it could have been so much more elegant and good for almost everybody.

I've read the whole thread if that's what you mean. Or maybe your saying you being a dick is a result of trampa/ben's actions. That's the thing with using uncommon words in place of the simple (english 101 will teach you not to do this btw) you tend to lose the meaning of what you're trying to say.
As for me stiring up shit, I'm not the one disregarding anything anyone is trying to say to me and repeating it over and over.
You've had months to have a problem with this, and it was not a secret as you try to make out, just secret to you apparently. 
The way **_VESC_** was being used by anyone that could piece together Ben's design whether it be with quality parts or just absolute shit, that was destroying the name and community. Those that sell good quality shit can still use the VESC name, hell they can even call it a VESC, so long as they talk to ben and go through the motions with him as already stated.
It's not @trampa that has exclusive access to the TM, they are the only ones that have got it at the moment, but there is nothing stopping Maytech, @onloop, @chaka, @torqueboards and others getting their license by talking to Ben. So if any of them are the ones that you've had conversations with about how _shitty_   this all is, perhaps their time would be best spent talking to Ben rather than you.

This is just going round in circles now. 

Should there have been a better comms plan around the enforcement of TM? Yes probably.

Is what @Trampa and BV doing right? Depends where you stand but its their decision and they aren't doing anything shady or illegal so move on. 

As far as I can see this move is only going to lead to positives. Its going to force makers to stand by their product - result in more personalisation ( @longhairedboy with the red brushed ally is a perfect example though I am waiting for someone to come up with an led riddled case to make a window worthwhile...), allow us builders to make a proper decision on where we put our money and whether the variance in price is worth it and Maytech will still bob along churning out their budget option.

I am alittle surprised a TM on VESC was granted since esc is so will used but either was I look forward to seeing how LHB, Chaka TB etc take this on.

It seems to me that anything that we formerly called a VESC we should now just call an **ESC8**. This new moniker starts with "ESC" (which it is) and the "8" basically makes it an ESC designed for electric sk8boards. This makes it unique and differentiates it from the ESC's used in RC cars, planes, etc. We'd all know that physically it's a VESC and give Vedder the credit he is due under the terms of the licensing agreement.

Enertion could have an ESC8-X Series, Torque could have an ESC8-T Series, Carvon could have an ESC8-C Series, and we (Jet Skateboards) could have an ESC8-J Series of Electronic Speed Controllers. We could add numbers and/or letters for different versions/generations such as a ESC8-J4.12 or ESC8-J6.  Alternatively we could put the brand before it and the version number after it such as a Jet ESC8-v4.12 or Jet ESC8-V6 or Jet ESC8.4.12

That's my two cents. Nobody steal my ESC8-J name!

Controllers based on the VESC-Project, are in most cases universal for all sorts of equipment, so naming it ESK8 whatever means cutting off all the other potential markets. Everyone using the same brand is not very wise, because in the end you want to build up a reputation, linked to your own brand. That is in the very interest of every brand. Customers buy from a certain source because they trust that source.

There is a logo and partner program in place. This program can be used for _identifying compatibility_ and _showing project support_. Customers will see who is supportive and they will see that 100% compatibility with the VESC-Software solutions is guaranteed. This does not mean the device is of a certain quality, because quality is something the individual brand has to stand in for. 

The best way forward is a rebranding, fair use of the trademark and joining the official partner program to support Benjamin, and show the compatibility. A bit of invest into R&D  is very wise, since more equipment and software can be developed, which makes more equipment available, which means the customer has access to more and better hardware/software and the manufacturer and vendor has more to offer and will in consequence have better sales. Most companies invest quite a bit into R&D, why would you want your R&D source to dry out, if you base your sales on the projects achievements? In my eyes it's stupid to cut that corner. 

Starting a campaign to rename or confuse the origin of the technology and software is purely an attempt to hide away the fact that the technology is coming from a certain source that put all the effort in to make it available in the first place.

Now everyone has the chance to join in and support the project and in return being granted huge benefits. 
In the end it's in the customers hands, since he will make the decision to purchase from a vendor/manufacturer who is project-supportive or not. This is only possible if a transparent system is in place, allowing the customers to clearly  identify project supporters. Since this transparency will be given very soon, there is no reason to be afraid of anything. 
The new, official partner program branding will establish itself in no time.

I think re-branding should only happen once a specific change has been made to the original open source design. Could get a little confusing for the uninitiated otherwise. 

ESC8 sounds like a good name for a fork in the OS design specific to electric skate. Or V-ESC8?

We have redesigned the 4.12 too and we have used some parts from your design.
And i must say ist very good working.

Now I'm confused. You're saying what NOT to call it, but you're not suggesting what we SHOULD call. It's been called a VESC for so long now that everyone in the electric skateboard market now has the problem of trying to figure out what to call it that isn't "VESC". And yes, everyone using it in other markets is screwed as well. I'm just trying to come up with a name that "we" (meaning the skateboard community) can live with. We didn't create this problem for ourselves, the rug was pulled out from under us and now we're scrambling to accommodate Vedder and apparently Trampa.

This doesn't have to be a big deal, but we DO need a name. It sucks because obviously "VESC" is the name that everyone knows, understands, and has been using since day one.

What do you suggest that we use now that VESC is off the table?

I'm not saying WHO should decide, I'm asking WHAT he suggests. I don't want a name such as "The artist formerly known as Prince" when everyone wants to call him Prince. Suddenly saying, "Hey, you can't use that name anymore" is problematic at best, and a really bad marketing decision that will bite people in the ass at worst. Seriously, what the hell are people supposed to call a Vedder designed/inspired ESC that everyone has just called a VESC for years? VESC is the best name for any and all such ESCs, regardless of whether or not they are open-source or not. Personally I think that Benjamin should have his trademark but _never_ enforce it unless and until he wants to shut down every open-source version. Trampa can have the only one called a VESC6 and everyone would know that their's is different than other VESCs, but forcing others to call their VESCs something other than VESC is just lame.

You can call a old Vesc still Vesc and the new ones too. Or DRVCooker, Coollittlespeedbox or whatever you want.
New Vesc will have new names, like Enertions Vesc is now a Focbox.

Hi @ChrisChaput, 
If you look into this world, you will see that many OS-Projects exist, despite the fact that the projects are having TMs.
Third party hardware simply uses different names - still everyone knows its compatible. 

How do you call a Arduino Clone or Compatible device?
http://makezine.com/2012/04/24/soapbox-my-top-10-favorite-arduino-compatible-clones-and-derivatives/

What would you suggest the VESC-Project should use as Trademark? Benjamin called his project VESC from day one, so its probably the TM he should own.

@akira[quote="akira, post:400, topic:23017, full:true"]

[/quote]

Am I the person who decided that the community is not allowed to use the name VESC any more?
The person who registered the TM is Benjamin BTW and he did that for a very good reason.
VESC links back to his good name, because he is the guy behind the project. 
The community (users) can use the name VESC as much as it likes. 
The Arduino community probably uses the Arduino TM frequently although the project does business on selling its own hardware and protects its TM, just like any other OS-Project does.

vesc is too hard to say anyway and VEC is what I always called it.  Hoping it catches.

It's a long thread and sorry if I'm redoing it but Is every vendor going to come up with their own name for a variation of the 4 now?

 Cant someone pretty much make the 6 and just call it whatever they want other than the vesc?  Looking forward to that!   $400 for the 6 is going too far and there's still a huge amount of room for other vendors it seems.    

Please someone make a VEC 4 that is reliable on FOC!   I don't need 50 amps continuous by a long shot.

Is the unreliability of FOC due to high erpm mainly?

Once again you've completely avoided the question of what everyone is supposed to call their VESC now. 

I'll answer your question. Benjamin should call his trademarked VESC-Project a VESC. Everyone would know what it is and he could add numbers and letters and symbols to it over time to make his unique. What I'm saying is that everyone should also be allowed to call theirs a VESC as well. There's no (good) reason why not to. Benjamin obviously has the right to call it a VESC and no one would ever suggest that he not. 

The time to enforce a Trademark is BEFORE the universe has accepted, adopted, and used a name in commerce for years. It's really too late to expect everyone NOT to use the only name that's ever been used to describe an object.

It seems to me it wasn't sustainable for him to continue working on this project.
My guess is that the donations weren't enough to keep him going. I'd like to see released the list of vendors who actually donated. Might add clarity as to why Benjamin decided he needed to do this.

If you have the TM, you need to assure that no one else uses it, since a TM serves the purpose that people can identify the original source. Legally you can't allow third parties to use the TM. That's the way it is.

Since most open source projects have a TM, there is probably a good reason for it.
So it's pretty obvious that Benjamin should have the TM before someone else takes it together with the OS-Code.
In consequence it's not possible to share the TM.
You also have to see that the project is more about the software than the hardware.

I have to disagree there.  I am 'choosing' to believe that Ben didn't know/understand what this action was going to do.  I am pretty sure Trampa knew exactly what they were doing.  

I think most people are just miffed that a vendor who hasn't really been a part of, at least, the electronics/engineering side of this community just kind of swooped in and took over.  Then after taking over proceeded, at least to my view, started bullying all of the other vendors over the name.  Trampa is essentially gaining the value of the name VESC because he PAID for it.  

Lastly, if you look at the new feature set for the VESC6, I think you will find that 90% of them were developed by @Ackmaniac, @evoheyax and others.  If you look at the Hardware changes, a lot of that was pioneered by vendors like @chaka, @torqueboards, @onloop and others.  So Open Source/Community development  is kind of getting the shaft on this thing.

Or Benjamin simply took its time to finish things off properly, while others tried to bridged the gap, partly implementing stuff that was part of Bens Vision ages back. 
Nothing wrong about that, don't get me wrong. 
VESC-X is a VESC 4 with DFs, in the layout sceme of VESC 5 for example. The original  design is VESC 5, which was skipped for the benefits of VESC SIX.
If you look at the throttle curves of VESC-Tool, you will see that its a completely different solution to the currently available ones, because Benjamin knew how he wanted things to be, but had the patience to finish the new Firmware first. Step B after Step A....
But now saying Benjamin copied others peoples work is a bit funny. 

VESC 5 showed it all ages ago. Now guess who was debating the layout of VESC 5 with Benjamin, long time before it even popped up on the Vedder Forum? That is a long time back, when everyone was still making the unchanged VESC 4.10 designs.

The whole thing is a joke
Trampa belongs to Ted Orr, the name Vesc belongs to Benjamin.
And frank makes the laws here who is allowed and who can not
I have only read the opinion of BV, but I'm not sure if he wrote that about the TM.
I know that Chacka is boss of Ollin Board, Jason of Enertion, Dexter of Torque Boards
Evoheyax from Rocketboards and many others also here
Also, there are many companies that build and sell the same product under license.
But Frank the writer of Trampa says that does not work!
In one point I must give frank right,
I have it checked by a lawyer the name VESK8 and i really can not used for one similar product.
Without license.
I also believe that if one is well-versed and take the Publish PDF file from V ... 6
And the pictures what have been published and Look at the parts
then expects all together, then he comes to that the V .... 6 no more cost as  $ 80 in production
For this I say full of respect im congratulate for big Business.
Im writing with a friend from BV who helped him by the V.... and before sitting Trampa
in the V.... Boat, he say me thats BV wants to produced the V....6 his own and sell himself.
And thats was not so long time here.
That's exactly how I know that Frank by from us in spring of 2016 V..... 4.12 for testing.
At the same time was the V....5 in discussion and at this time was Trampa in matters of electroboards
nowhere.
So i think thats what Frank say:
VESC 5 showed it all ages ago. Now guess who was debating the layout of VESC 5 with Benjamin, long time before it even popped up on the Vedder Forum? That is a long time back, when everyone was still making the unchanged VESC 4.10 designs.
I think the debating makes not Frank.
That´s was only profiling and a big Bullshit,

What can Trampa prove?

As I just started to look at building my own board I came in the middle of this mess. It's now very confusing to find the controller in looking for when everyone has to just pick a random name for it. Imo the naming should stay "vesc-[version]-[hw type]-[brand]" or similar. 

Like now I'm googling and trying to figure out what brand I can go for when I want to use the latest vesc software. Obviously trampa brand comes up quickly with the vesc6 but I assume that is because of the trademark hijacking they did? I'll continue googling tho and see if I can figure this out. Paying an insane premium to trampa isn't temping seeing how they played their cards in this business. I'd rather pay the same to Benjamin or some of they guys that has been in "since the start" in the OS project building the VESC brand before trampa hijacked it.

The vesc market up till now has been filled with a mixup of decent escs and some that are junk all under the vesc name.   There are many people who saw the name vesc from a vendor and with a good price and didn't know any better and they jump into a pile of steaming electronics.   With this trademark every vendor's product will have to have it's own name and can't latch onto the vesc good rep with junky stuff.     Now every vendor is on his own and must make his own name literally and figuratively. I think it's good.

I look forward to seeing what the different vendors come up with.   Since the 6 is way overkill in the amp department for a e-board for everyone but a sumo wrestler I think the vendors will realize this and spend their time just working on the robustness of FOC!!  I hope so.

It seems e-boards are just a stepping stone for the vesc and it's moving on to more powerful things.  No need for us to pay to get on that bus.

You all don't get the point that the VESC-Project is 98% software related. Benjamin doesn't want project forks to use the VESC-Brand. Fair enough I would say.
If he would not have the TM, anyone could grab the code and market it under the same brand, open up VESC Domains, distribute VESC-Software etc. The customer would be left totally confused, from whom they actually should download the software and if that software is compatible or safe to use. It would end in a right mess. VESC-Tool will be the original source, quality approved by BV. Hardware will be branded individually, and who wishes to show compatibility and project support can join a partner program, making use of a special branding. There will be a listing on the official website, so if customers want to find out what options they have, no problem! I think you guys also want to know if the hardware you buy will support the project. That is also a quality feature, because you all want new features and better software, that can only be programmed with sufficient funding of the project. Benjamin and I had quite a few debates how to set up the VESC-Project in a sustainable way. You don't make decisions like that without debating every single aspect several times. You also look at other projects and try to understand why they manage certain things in a certain way. You look at problems that occurred in the past and find solutions  preventing the same things to happen to your project.
If everyone would use the same Brand for hard- and software, total  confusion is pre-programmed. This confusion happened already, customers where unsure about differences in the products and several VESC-Domains existed, offering links to software downloads. Only the well informed customer knew the differences and the original source for software downloads. 
You always have to think from the perspective of a uninformed customer.

If he would not have the TM, anyone could grab the code and market it under the same brand, open up VESC Domains, distribute VESC-Software etc. The customer would be left totally confused, from whom they actually should download the software and if that software is compatible or safe to use. It would end in a right mess. VESC-Tool will be the original source, quality approved by BV. Hardware will be branded individually, and who wishes to show compatibility and project support can join a partner program

But the VESC has already been out for years now... and customers ALREADY KNOW where to download it from, and it HASNT been confusing, and it HASNT been a mess, and it HAS been sustainable. 

I think @mmaner pretty much already said everything that needs to be said but I don't believe that the community is going to let you hear the end of it 

I think you're not really getting the message Trampa. Stick to your already existing products that everyone loves even though they are expensive and keep your hands out of the VESC world. Although I guess it's already too late for that. 

Either way, what you did was essentially a middle finger to the community and the community is going to repay that buy ridiculing you and not buying the product which is now disastrously overpriced anyway.

It has been sustainable for vendors, but not for the man who made it happen and who put thousands of hours into the code and HW design (because hardly anyone gave back a sufficient amount of donations). Vesc-domains have been grabbed, websites existed that gave the impression to be the original source, uninformed customers do not know the original source, they had do dig themselves through a jungle of information.

The fact that nothing has happened so far (which is not the case BTW) doesn't mean nothing will happen in future. This is why you wear a belt when driving your car. Because if something happens it could be a catastrophic. So why take the risk?
Crappy VESCs definitely had a negative impact on the brand VESC. People get frustrated if a product fails. If that product is branded VESC, part of this frustration will impact the brand for sure. This is why its comfortable to use another brand than your own to sell a product that is likely to fail. 
In the end it is a faulty VESC, not a faulty xyz! The forum here is full of VESC problems. For the uninformed customer a VESC is a risky invest, because many people had problems with crappy VESCs.

Every member of the community can make its own decision and like the fact that VESC is a TM - or not. I personally think that most people here do want the VESC-Project to be taken further and therefore will accept the fact that the project now rests on more solid  foundations, which is imperative for the future of the project. There is a reason why most OS-Project have TMs. 
Why the hell on earth should the VESC-Project be an exception? The same risks exist, so the same steps need to be taken to prevent negative impacts. It's a no-brainer.

Rude? I just explain why. This is not rude. Its at best repetitive. People throw accusations at me all the time. So what do you expect? 
I give an answer.
I don't get the point that people can't except the fact that OS-Projects usually have a TM for a good reason. Why should the VESC-Project not have the same rights? In my eyes its imperative. 

You always played things fair, I know that. 
If a project succeeds, its vulnerable to attacks and bad means, you can't deny the fact. The TM is the only tool to assure a certain control over the use of the Brand.
As you may have realized its Benjamins TM, because its his baby.

Did I say it was my idea to use DFs? No I didn't. I said I debated the VESC 5 with him, namely the form factor and connector position, so its easy to design housings with good access to the connectors and good DFs cooling. 
People said I never did anything for the project, just popped up with money and hijacked the thing. Not true. I put a lot of effort in over a long period of time. 

I personally think posting images like you did is a bit rude and suggestive.

Benjamin will set everything up. Probably Git Hub!

That's excellent!
I'm just wondering if i could please get a copy of the VESC 6 firmware thus far, since i made up some HW compatible with the VESC 6 pinouts only, and wanted to start playing with my hardware...  :grimacing:

Thanks,
Dimi
