Hi guys, i am Francesco from italy!
I wonder if here there are any italians that use electric skateboards with success in italy.
I ordered the parts to make one and will use it this summer in my city, but i am vorried about police and law.
What is your experience as italian electric skateboard user? did you had any trouble? Do you have any advice to a  new electric skateboard user in our country?
Thanks in advance for sharing

It feels kinda sketchy to talk in English while we're both Italian, but let's do it anyway, so that people can have an idea about other countries.
I'm from Vicenza, where exactly are you? I've only seen one guy ever on an eskate, that was a 1st gen carbon evolve, he was taking his dog out for a walk i think. I know @fottaz and @fedestanco are both Italian, they may answer some of your questions. Anyway, I don't think police even knows what an eskate is.
About the law, technically they aren't even included in any cathegory. "Acceleratori di andatura", like normal skateboards or rollerskate are technically illegal in the streets, but since this doesn't acceletate your speed, but has its own, it doesn't fall in that cathegory. Ebikes can go up to 25km/h while pedaling, but that only works for 2 wheeled devices. Segway made an agreement and has its own law, they can go 6 km/h on the sidewalk and 20 km/h on bike lanes. That's what I would refer to if I was stopped by police

I've got already stopped by carabinieri (we have different kinds of police, It looks like one or twoares not enough for Italy).
Ero in una provinciale, me la son cercata :smiley: mi hanno solo fatto capire di usarlo in strade non trafficate, mi hanno detto che potevano anche sequestrarmelo. Sto c........

Anyway, just ride in safe streets and police won't really care about it. Better to use bycicle lanes when possible (even if in my city San Bonifacio, near Verona, we don't have so much of it and if there are, they will interrupt suddently, without a real meaning :anguished:)


I'm ready to get a lawyer if they want to confiscate my board, because they haven't really forbidden it yet. Defend you rights!

Comunque per componenti spediti dall'italia ho aperto un sito l'anno scorso, in continua evoluzione [www.eskating.eu](http://eskating.eu) Ho anche creato il 1° Forum italiano dedicato a noi builders di longoboard elettrici [builders.eskating.it](http://builders.eskating.it/)

Non vedo l'ora di avere altri builders sul forum ITA, sta già venendo fuori un bel gruppetto 😋

La tavola me la sono fatta io con fogli di betulla e vetroresina. 

Setup elettronico:
- motore: turnigy sk3 5055-280kv
- ESC: x-car beast 120A
- batteria: 4500mAh 6S compact ( era in offerta e volevo rimanere in un budget stretto )

Grandissimo! Io ho adottato un setup un pò diverso da quelli consigliati.
Ho usato uno longboard economissimo  di quelli ribassati (45€) con la doppia curvatura, Come motore ho scelto uno veloce da 380Kv perchè molto potente, con rapporto 3:1 , e ho utilizzato una catena e pignoni invece della cinghia.
Batteira 5000mAh 6s

Hey ciao, io sono da venezia e sto progettando ora di fare un longboard elettrico ho già una tavola apollo e in radiocomando, ho solo un po' di domande.
1 tanti usano sk3 da 80€ ma ho visto uno arrivare ai 40kmh con un prop drive da 40 e non capisco cosa devo guardare
2 per sfruttare meglio un motore devo fare che tensione e che corrente? 
3 perché ci sono esc da tanti ampere che costano tanti e altri che costano poco?
4 ce la faccio a prendere motore, batteria e esc a 200€?

Ti rispondo in italiano ma prova a scrivere in inglese da qui in poi.
Sono da Vicenza, un altro qua è  da Verona, se serve posso darti una mano.
Il minimo che userei come motore è un 5065, ma vista la differenza di costo minima alla fine ti conviene un 6374. Non riuscirai a spendere così poco. Ho cominciato con quel budget e mi son trovato a spendere 550 euro, ma conviene aspettare e spendere di più avendo una buona tavola piuttosto che spendere poco e ammazzarsi perché si rompe in mezzo alla strada.Ti conviene andare da 24 a 36 volt nominali, da 6s a 10s lipo o liion, e considera un margine sui 60 ampere.
L'esc migliore è il vesc, ma costa sui 100 euro ed è più efficiente in 8 o 10s. Cerca gruppi d'acquisto, aspetti di più ma spendi meno. Metti da parte altri soldi e preparati a costi imprevisti. Se riesci a farti da te il motor mount e adattarlo a truck che hai già è un bel risparmio!

```
It depends .
Usually a low Kv motor is suggested,  with power ranging from 1Kw to 2Kw or even more, but more power means more battery drain.
When you are considering a motor you can use a speed and range calculator,( there are some linked here on the forum somwhere if you search) where you input the values of the motor you are considering, and play wih battery voltages, capacity, gear ratio, and wheel diameter to see what you can expect from that motor .
The choice is yours, but if you are not the experimental kind of guy you can always copy the setup of other people to be sure.

Your motor choice depends on the battery you decide to go for. Speed isn't a problem, you can reach 50km/h even with small motors. What they won't give you is torque (you won't be able to climb a hill) and probably reliability, as they are probably gonna heat up a lot. 
There are some speed calculators you can use to check that. 
You have to decide a specific motor Kv. Kv determines what voltage you need to get to a certain speed. If you go for a 10s battery, a 190Kv motor will be enough. If you are using 6s, you will have to get a higher kv, like 245, and sacrifice torque, but get the same speed in the end. 
Higher voltage is more efficient, which means will draw less amps, which means less heat to dissipate. I would recommend 10s on 190kv with 15/36 ratio for pulleys, that's a good standard setup. If you're really broke, just buy 6s and 245kv but you will feel the need to upgrade later

It depends on your budget and needs. >5000 mAh, you can either go for lipos from hobbyking (but you will need to connect them in series and/or parallel and charge them one at the time with a balance charger) or liions. With liions you either get a pack already built, but that's 250 euros, or build yourself one if you have enough knowledge to solder/spotweld them. If you think you can wait and raise more money, send me a pm and I may be able to build you a very good one (probably better than boosted) in about 3 months, but that's gonna cost ~700 euros (still a great deal, considering prices of commercial boards)

360kv is a bit too high, you will have very little torque. 260 should work
Check [this](http://calc.esk8.it/#{"batt-type-lipo":1,"batt-cells":6,"motor-kv":360,"system-efficiency":80,"motor-pulley-teeth":15,"wheel-pulley-teeth":36,"wheel-size":90}|)

hi everybody! I'm Giacomo, from Milano. Here I roam around with a single drive 6s lipo setup. It's been a year since I completed the build: nothing fancy, just right to take me from home to work and back on a non daily basis. I've encountered some other folks with e-boards, some kooweels and even a boosted but no-one with a diy. I've also received lots of questions about eskating and how to build. even a policeman asked me how fast and far could it go. I maybe lucky but I was never stopped by a policeman, but I rarely go fast or go on the roads: I use it on sidewalks and bike lanes.
it was all good and funny till I forgot to remove the loop key and went out for a week end and now I'm stuck with two 3s dead lipos and lots of sadness...
I'm thinking about getting a li-ion 6s2p with a bms and I don't know where to start. the alternative path is to stick with lipos, but with a bms this time, so I don't have to charge 2 separate batteries and unmount the battery holder everytime.. can any fellow Italian give me some help in this regards?

It's cool that many countries teaches English at an early age. I wish American schools taught other languages, but I guess it's hard to decide on one language to teach when English is the most used on already. Foreign language is taught (graduation requirement) in high school where I'm at (at about 14-18 years old) you get to choose one language and most don't use what they learn once the class is over.

We start studying English when we are 6 y/o, but many of us remain terrible at it. I learned more on the Internet than at school actually, but I love the fact that nearly everybody here knows at least 2 languages, + regional dialects. We actually study a 2nd foreign language when we are 11 y/o, either French or Spanish, and we can decide if we want to keep studying it till we're 19 depending on the subjects we decide to go for. In high school we have russian, chinese and german lessons too, and even ancient greek and latin (that's what I'm studying)

Fortunately one of the best esk8 sellers in EU lives in Italy; check out his website eskating.eu
500€ budjet will make a working board but you won't give you the smoothest ride or the most convenient experience.
I suggest you to save a little more and to upgrade some components in this order: a strong vesc for FOC, a bms with ON-OFF soft switch, quality wheels, lion batteries.

Welcome!

They can take your board and do some testings with it, if it‘s to powerfull (the boosted and almost every other board is) you won‘t get it back.
But, most of them don‘t know, the two scenarios i did encounter in reality were:
- if i see them first, i go off throttle and push, they won‘t recognize it‘s electric
- if they see me first, they probably didn‘t much know about laws and/or eskate, and just were amazed to see me riding such a wonder of tech

They‘re called carabin“ieri“ cause they‘re from yesterday:p

Hi guccio, simple skateboarding on the pavements is forbidden in Italy if your speed is more than 6  Km/h or if your behaviour endanger other pedestians.
So if the police stops you this is the worst possible scenario:

- they get your board
- they  get 5 points from your drive licence (if you have any)
- they fine you with 1.200 Euro which consists of:

849 Euro because you have no insurance
77 Euro because your board has no license plate
81 Euro in case you have no helmet for motorcycle on
155 Euro because you have no certificate of circulation
(they simply see your board as a scooter without the necessary documents and safety equipment)

reference:
 http://www.ladige.it/news/cronaca/2017/05/05/skate-elettrico-non-omologato-maxi-multa-1200-euro

(the guy was hoverboarding a 0 Km/h while pushing the pram of his son)

So I can't imagine what they could do if they get you running 40Km/h on the street smiling at them

good luck

I dunno if there's a thread on here about "how to behave in case of police" could be useful, though.

This is what I do:
- **low profile** 
- FOC mode on (in order not to make too clear yours is an e-board)
- choose wisely my route (avoid busy road, better alleys, bicycle lanes and so on)
- sidewalk is my friend (as soon as I see the police I lower the speed and get on it in order to "mimethize" with the pedestians)
- in case of confrontation with the police (happened once) spare them the whole e-mobility (rightful) melodrama, be basic:  got brakes, lights, helmet, was driving slow etc. They should understand you are no danger.

Well, I've been stopped by a policeman here in Milano, but he was really cool and just wanted to know about the board. He even tried it and told me if it could go faster (I run a 6s and a 245kv motor to a conservative 20-25 km/h max).
Always wear a helmet and don't behave like a stupid/disrespectful person.
I tend to ride only on bike lanes when possible and if there's no bike lanes on the sidewalks, very slowly.
If there's a lot of ppl on the sidewalk I lift the board and walk til I have free space ahead.
