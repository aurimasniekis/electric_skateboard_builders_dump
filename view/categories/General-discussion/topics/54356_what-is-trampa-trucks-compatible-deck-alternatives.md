Hi guys, I got bit tired of flex in my deck at higher speed, I feel like shaker with 15 ply deck... I thinking of getting maybe 17 ply but still would like something stiffer maybe there is an alternative which I haven't seen yet.

You can buy something on their site that just mounts to your deck and stiffens it

Flexbridge... Works a treat to stiffen things up, while torsional stiffens is not impacted to much.
You can mount two flex bridges side to side if that is needed. 
Or get a 17 Ply deck from us. I don't think that you will find a lot of alternatives offering 35° steering angle.
Wooden decks usually offer only 20°, since the wood is not easy to bend that much, which will result in poor steering characteristics. Wood also tends to get more flexy after a while of use since the wooden fibres weaken over time. Also water and moisture is an issue on the long run. 
We can proudly say that we offer a life time warranty for our decks and you can clean the entire board with a waterjet (at least the non non electric boards). 
I'm pretty sure that you will find someone wanting a 15 Ply. Your deck should be easy to sell.

Hey Kugey,
I think running duel 6384 motors you have surpassed the design specification of what the trampa deck was designed for. From my experience and that of others once you get up over 50kmh, say 60kmh just coming off the throttle can start to cause torsional bucking/flex. Essentially you are loading the deck up with all the energy it takes to propel you forward and then it is released when the load is taken away.
If you where just falling down a hill this issue does not arise.
Front wheel drive might limit this. A similar thing happens or any driven deck and is why people go for downhill decks to go fast.
The Trampa deck is a awesome all terrain/free style deck designed to take big hits and carve it up in the dirt. Use it and love it for what it is is my recommendation.

My trampa is 17ply, so was the late RIP @BigBoyToys, and we both got the "buck" BigBro couldn't get his monster board over 40mph because he could not control the board coming off the gas.

My max speed is 35mph but the problem is not top speed but something close to 20mph and happens when going over a small bumps on the road... Feels like the deck flexes because of too much weight for it...

@trampa I don't really want to use those flexbridge I would better just buy new deck... Also I could use flat deck and machine alu angle adapters or etc wouldn't be hard...

Also I will try today orange dampas and will see maybe they will fix the problems. Otherwise I will be getting new deck.

P.S. I don't know why but for some reason my back foot is always getting numb of the angle and force its getting don't know what to do with it maybe at slight angle footrest like the same 35º would make it better..

I run my trucks set up directional with a stiffer rear truck, this helps. I think part of the problem could be solved by dewedging the rear truck to help prevent the oscillation from the two. You could machine up a riser to take 5-10 degrees out of the rear truck? Hell if you make e'm i'll prob. buy one :rofl:

@Cobber : thx for dropping in. 

**Offtopic:**
I really have my concerns with boards posted on this website exceeding a certain speed.
Going 50Km/h on a board is potentially deadly. Each super fast built advertises such boards. Desires are created which put people at risk. 

There have been a lot of debates about helmets and safety gear.
What we need is a debate about **active safety** in addition to passive safety features like helmets.
Active safety is what you can do to prevent a crash / accident. 
Ridiculous fast boards dramatically impact your active safety! No one needs such a fast board. We try to promote slower boards and the fun going off-road and doing jumps etc. 35Km/h is already very fast on a board.

Don't put people at risk by creating desires that are not healthy. 

@Kug3lis, why don't you put yourself on a train to Nottingham. You can try things out. We have plenty of boards to test ride. Benjamin and I will be there Thursday to Saturday.

I dont really ride high speeds for e.g. my top speed is like 40km/h and average less than 20km/h

The train ticket would cost more than the flexbridges :D It's bit expensive to come over

For example one of my DH deck's has 45 degree front trucks and 25 degree rear. By having the trucks different you don't get a oscillation back and forth multiplying the wobble, the wobbles kind of just get absorbed by the rear trucks slower rate of turn.

I think a 5-10 degree wedge to place on the rear between the deck and the trucks would do the trick, having the thick part of the wedge toward the middle of the deck will either give you more steering in the front or less in the rear.

5 degree would prob. be a good place to start, de wedge the rear and if need be wedge the front. de wedging rear will take a bit of your turn away, but you can gain it back by wedging the front if need be.

If you make some and don't pull my pants down over the bread and honey i'll try a couple :sunglasses:

How heavy are you?
I'm 100kg on the 17ply...

Good to know :stuck_out_tongue:

I am just curious about how to solve back feet getting numb... Because it's handling all the torque all the time.. At strange angle maybe making foot rest with angle would help I don't know :/

There is not much available for similar setup, if I would like to go street board style I would want so deep U style deck something similar to Evo then some wide hanger (wider than tb218) to make it pretty wide and 8" wheels...

P.S. I will never going to go to urethanes :D

bend up a aluminium deck?

as for your rear foot, maybe try some mbs f5 bindings, or another padded binding?

I dont use bindings just plain deck with griptape :) Which is all ok, but just i dont know maybe my stance is wrong the  back food 90 to deck and front one is like 45-60 degree to front...

maybe more weight on your front foot would help both your numb rear foot and this twitch problem you have?

best way to learn is on a gravity deck IMHO

I think it's high time you talked to @pat_arch about a LaCroix. Just hate flex or associated wobble?

+200lbs LaCroix would still flex but predictably so at speed, it has concave and can accomodate your clown-sized feet :rofl:
https://www.lacroixboards.com/product-page/board-carbon-fiber-enclosure-prototipo

The Trampa material essentially works like a swimming pool springboard, maybe you would like the Orrsum which would not flex as much but it's only sold as a complete.

Others have fallen in love with the Evo
http://landyachtz.com/us/evo-skate-explore

You could cheap out and get a MBS like myself, very comfortable & wide and relatively free thane -junk the trucks

You can use an MBS deck with Trampa trucks. The pro97 and the comp95 have zero flex and a similar angle (30 degrees I think), although just adding bindings may solve the problem. We're pretty close to the same weight, and I regularly ride on street over 50kmh with no flex issues, but with a 16ply.

Yeah I hear ya, falling with bindings sucks! Had a couple falls at low speeds, but nothing fast yet (gotta invest in some more pads). Just me personally, I don't think I'd want any camber at all if I weren't using bindings. MBS deck might be worth a try. The off center concave on the two I listed has got a nice feel to it too. Like banjaxxed mentioned, the LaCroix deck might be a good option as well. I have one on order, looking forward to trying it out.

I bought one of these and it is rock solid...can't beat the price.  $14USD and shipping $19USD good communication with seller sent tracking number. The deck is bare with a nice coat of poly.

As close as you can come to zero flex.

I'd swap my comp95 deck for your Trampa if you're up for it, as long as there isn't any holes drilled through it. Did have to reshape the tail a bit to make room for the belt drive though. If I was riding without bindings and didn't want flex this would be my go-to.

Built this board for my daughter to ride. 15ply should be spot on for her weight.
