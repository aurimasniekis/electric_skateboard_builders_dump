Hi guys-

I saw @Mikkiller 's post(http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/new-member-introduce-yourself-here-tell-us-your-plan/216/894?u=decdog) about hobbyking's esk8 kit and I thought I should make a thread about it. They also sell vescs

Here is the link to the kit: https://hobbyking.com/en_us/catalog/product/view/id/63725/s/skateboard-conversion-kit

Here is the link to the vesc: 
https://hobbyking.com/en_us/catalog/product/view/id/63721/s/vesc

What do you think?

That's pretty much everything needed to make an esk8 for $500. Just add $110 for 2x5s, a $60 controller, and a cheap deck. Who will be the first to make the leap in the name of science?

Seeing these products for sale is really interesting - it suggests a growth in DIY building when companies that didn't previously have anything to do with skating are jumping in.

I'm conflicted because I've used several Turnigy products in the past (mostly motors) and they have been great. My daily esk8 still has an SK3 motor. 

But - 

Those trucks and mounts look toy-quality, and I'm appalled that they suggest strapping LIPOs onto the bottom of the deck with a little velcro and no enclosure! 

The Quantum remote used in their video has already been field tested by members here and the result wasn't good. Right @lowGuido ? 

I'm sure that using this kit will "work" for a short period of time, until any significant usage occurs and something snaps.

The VESC is a tempting price, but there are vendors here in the DIY community that sell VESCs for just a slightly higher cost with a known track record. Also, all VESC have a "BEC" that can power the receiver. That is just marketing rhetoric. It's also worrysome that they'd sell the VESC without any instruction for setting it up properly for esk8. What about motor detection, battery and voltage settings, etc?... If kids treat this like a typical hobby ESC and try to just plug it in w no configuration it will, at best, ruin the vesc before it gets on the road and at worst, cause major injury when it fails at speed.

The batteries strapped on with velcro does remind me of my first build (see frightening pictures in the recent photo only post), probably why they do lots of slow motion and filler clips don't want to show the batteries falling off the bottom and dragging on the brick pavement.

Kidding aside could spend some decent money on a better board and enclosure with how cheap the kit is relative to buying all the components separately, seems worth checking out, if only my wallet agreed.  Will have to wait and see what the (un)lucky buyer gets for the price.

Seems it was a good time to start doing completes, but there are a fair amount of "established" competitors in that market as well.  From the feedback I've seen about the Raptor 2 (latest eskate pr0n vids) and just following you in general I'm sure it is incredible, so hopefully you can scoop a bigger part of the market share and keep growing the company (know you were going for organic growth not seed funding and all and it seems to be working out).

I have bought a loooot of parts from HK over the years...mostly stuff for multirotors because for years they were the only place to get stuff at a reasonable price...quality is hit or miss...but in the old days of multirotors (b4 "drone" racing and DJI taking over the market share) longevity of parts was not super important because we usually either crashed or rebuilt within a week....there stuff is cheap no doubt....stuff like wire; connectors; shrink wrap; and low stressed lipos can't be beat on price....but now a days there are many us shippers for the "drone" industry.....

I would guess these esk8 parts would be good for a first diy...for someone new to building stuff.....like there RC  ready to fly planes...i have bought and crashed many......but as we all know...the second diy is close behind.....and that's when people will step up to higher quality once they have success.....but I agree...not a long durability product...a whistle wetter...

What I am saying is they will act as a predator.... they are interested in profit alone.

They will eventually eat smaller business up that don't have an obvious niche that sets them apart...

This is only a problem for a small business that is trying to grow larger & take more market share - if you are not trying to grow larger this is probably not much of a concern.

I agree with you @onloop they will shamelessly copy everyone's ideas and undercut on price....but the quality will not be there...just the cheapness...

The RC forums are covered with threads on them ripping off the old SimonK escs firmware and not paying anything back to the creator....many such cases....

But then there are successes too (much less mind you) like fatshark goggles...that HK carries...exposing FS  to thousands of new sales....

Wondering when Hobbyking gets a nasty email from Trampa ðŸ˜‚

Hobbyking
> Turnigy 50A VESC...


[vesc-project](http://vesc-project.com/trademark_policies)
> **Incorrect**: "your product name"- "Mr.Vedder mark"

> example: Your Brand VESCÂ®


Really Hobbyking should rename their product, but I'm guessing they have a bit more cash to throw at lawyers.

OR, maybe Hobbyking throws the cash at Vedder himself so he can go full time on the VESC ðŸ˜ƒ.

I'd be shocked if that was anything better than a rebranded maytech "VESC."
@fraannk you are correct. HW 4.10 was not ideal for FOC. Also, you'll fry the DRV8302 if you actually try and get 1.5A out of its buck converter (irrelevant of it being HW v4.10) as they are claiming.

Moved from duplicate thread.

I'm torn on this. I like that there's now a cheap complete system available, and it seems like a really solid deal for beginners, but at the same time I've watched over and over again as hobbyking does this in the RC and multirotor industries- they wait for passionate companies to put in the R&D time to really develop systems to provide a good experience, and then completely undercut them because they don't have to shoulder the same R&D expenses. I've watched many innovative multirotor companies go under because hobbyking and the banggood folks stole their design and made a copy at a fraction of the price.
Right now, I'm looking at it this way: Yes, it sucks that HK is now going to likely be the go-to place for beginners, but people don't often build a single esk8 and feel content. I'm hoping this will be a good way for people to get a really good riding experience for not much money, and then take their business to the more innovative and quality brands as they progress.

Hehe. I said this was going to happend in the VESC thread :) They don't care much for a T/R mark at all if they can make a copy of that as well :p I think we are going to see a vesc6 when they release the schematics for that ^^

Awesome installation. Of course the mosfets need to touch the motor (shortest possible connection) but i didn't know that the hall sensor cables insulation need to touch the motor as well.

I want to see the face of that guy when he notice at full speed that his receiver or the entire VESC fell off.

And the pulley cover is a nice rock catcher.

And of course it makes sense that the wheelpulley screws and outer plate comes with the motor pulley cover and not with the pulley kit itself. This way they prevent that stupid people drive without a motor pulley cover which would be nuts (you might miss the best rocks).

And why did i spent so much time building a enclosure? Luckily now the straps are on the market. Do they also sell meat for the barbecue?

Hi guys,

Has anyone seen this kit before? It says it comes with a Turnigy VESC rated up to 14s! I didn't know they even made them. Seems like a really good deal from the company that makes most of our motors anyway.

Would love some feedback from anyone whose tried it!

https://hobbyking.com/en_us/catalog/product/view/id/63725/s/skateboard-conversion-kit

> ESC Specs:
> Microprocessor: STM32F4
> BEC: 5V (Used to power your receiver)
> Voltage: 8V to 60V (Up to 14S LiPo Voltage)
> Current: Up to 240A for a few seconds or 50A continuous
> PCB size: 40mm x 60mm
> VESC complete size: 120mm x 40mm
```

Here's a link to all their individual skateboard parts:  https://hobbyking.com/en_us/catalog/category/view/s/electric-skateboard-conversion-kit/id/7590



* $90 Sensored 12S motors with keyway and extended axles 

* $8 motors mounts

* $9 pulley /  motor mount covers

* $22 pulley kit (looks to be 12mm HTD, unknown gear ratio)




Honestly most of it doesn't look too bad....  Even their (Maytech?) VESC v4.10 will be leaps and bounds better than the car/boat ESC that many beginner HobbyKing builds use

Yesterday I ordered some suff from HobbyKing and thought I'd check on their skateboard parts.. Looks like they updated pulleys/belt set listing with some specs:

> Large gear: 36 tooth 
> Overall Diameter: 56mm
> Center hole diameter: 25.9mm 
> Width: 23mm
> Small gear: 15 tooth
> Overall Diameter: 27.9mm
> Width 23mm
> Belt Diameter: 91.1mm
> Width: 15mm

From these, I don't think the product image is of actual product. Either specs or pics are lying, anyone bought/received this set yet?

VESC still not available, 404, thank you trampa.

Motor mount specs still not listed but there are couple of threads here with first looks/reviews/thoughts/measurements.

Has anyone actually bought this? I went back and looked today and the full kit is back in stock again. Just bought it. Not a big fan of HK's business ethics but this will just be on a little commuter cruiser, I'm planning on doing a proper high speed 12s build soon with dual hub motors (@Hummie :wink: ) and quality parts. Will let you guys know how the kit quality is once I receive it.

Got a board built up with this kit today.
Build was an hour tops, would have been faster if I didn't take ages to figure out I had the mount on the wrong side of the truck.
I've just been running 8s (2x4s2200) so far, but will be upping to 12s (2x6s5800) in a few days. If I understand correctly, torque won't increase with voltage right? In any case, I can definitely say it's got plenty of torque for me so far. Took a good while to manage to accelerate without popping a wheelie (24" kicktail deck probably doesn't help with that).

I'm very impressed with the quality of the parts, especially the mount. Seriously beefy chunk of metal. Motor is really nice too, very high quality and the a solid deal for a sensored motor. My only complaint is that while the included trucks are fairly decent, the bushings are _awful_. Not even PU, Seems to me like they're some sort of polycarbonate. I'll be throwing some orange nipples on here right away.

Not a lot of riding footage, but here's my first few attempts (in cinematic vertical video thanks to my talented cameraman). Will post some decent pictures soon.

Nah I got used to it after a while. I'm used to riding cruisers with my back foot right up on the kicktail at all times for maneuvering, turns out that makes riding electric completely impossible. After about 30 minutes I was zipping up and down the road screaming like a madman.
Good thing the brakes are powerful, although being single drive I really had to get my weight over the rear wheels to have decent braking traction.

Motor pulley cover is self explanatory, black ring in top left is the back plate that sits on the inside of the drive wheel, and the wheel is sandwiched between it and the drive pulley by the four long bolts you see in the bottom left. Short screws are for mounting the pulley cover, and the brass ring sits around the shaft and prevents rubbing on the mount plate, but I didn't use it as I didn't experience any rubbing and the brass was making contact with both and causing a squeaking sound.

Cheers, I thought that might be the retainer ring but then again, weird that doesn't come with pulley set they are selling. But it is good info to know, @tueboard actually asked about the retainer few posts above :)

Good price for a VESC with a one year warrany

> _HobbyKing.com accepts no responsibility for the improper installation and use of purchased products. The **warranty period is... 1 year for other products such as internal parts (ESC**, motor, servo, etc.) ... The warranty period is effective unless otherwise stated on the product listing._


Too bad it is based on 4.10 hardware, instead of 4.12.  You could add the capacitor yourself, but I bet it would void the warranty.  Stick with BLDC and it shouldn't be much of a problem

For what it's worth, I am running the HK esc on FOC mode and so far so good. 8S pushing a Racestar 5065 motor.

In fact when I loaded up the BLDC took it was in default in FOC mode for some reason.

I'm a bit late to the party but I got one of these kits (+ 2x Turnigy 5S 5000mA). My first ever esk8 ride was on my 34" board with this kit and I'm impressed. Can't say how much better/worse it is than any other kits.

I spent about 3-4 hours putting this together as I wanted it in an enclosure and nice and tidy (I'm an ex-electronics engineer).

Well-impressed by the torque (not even full-throttle yet). Don't care about the speed. If anything this kit would good at informing the new rider.

**ALSO:** keen to know if this would fit the ABEC-11 wheels. Any offering to measure some bolt-hole spacings for me?

Alright, my verdict after a couple months with this setup:
It's a *really* solid kit. Seriously. For the money, I'm absolutely chuffed overall. Also fwiw, I've been running the kit in FOC since day one on 12s with no issues at all, and I ride it hard. I live halfway up mount tamalpais, CA and ride to the top and back on a regular basis. 

Anyone who's considering this kit, here's my advice to get the most out of it:
1: don't touch those battery straps with a ten foot pole. Make yourself a decent enclosure and do it right. Lipos and road rash don't mix.
2: take the time to tune the vesc. Do the motor calibration, everything. It's smooth out of the box, but even smoother once really tuned right.
3: replace the bushings *immediately*. Get yourself some nipples off Amazon and install them. The stock bushings make for an almost unrideable board.
4: make sure to loctite everything, especially the screws that clamp the mount to the truck. Otherwise you're asking for trouble. (Ask me how I found out)

Do that, and you'll have a really sweet board for a great price, especially considering the convenience of getting all your main electronics in one package and not needing to hunt around.

PS. This kit is *bonkers* on 12s. Seriously fast, and the acceleration is stupid. Take it easy the first few rides.

Agreed, although I have no experience. I was sure that an entry-level-ish kit like this would have compromises... it's nice to know that no-one has found one yet (aside from bushings I guess).

Sucks being remote (NZ) and having to ship stuff (like from Amazon).

Does anyone know the wheel diameter of this conversion kit? 

When having to order wheels, they tend to be quite expensive when shipping costs are included. However, having the right sized wheels for your preference and the normal surface you ride on is important. I myself have already made an good powerful board that cost me quite a lot of money, but a friend of mine that is interested in building his own board does not have the same budget as me, and this really seems like a sensible kit. 

Also: Is the motor mount actually good sturdy, or is it just a cheaply madeplate that could crack easily?

The HK site says specifically what the wheel diameter is (83mm maybe?).

There is another thread somewhere that talks about the mount. One or two people had an issue with it but I have had no problem whatsoever. Definitely a sturdy mount (from my limited experience).

Thanks @skelstar! I read through it so many times, but I guess I somehow must have missed it. HK says that the wheel diameter is 87.8mm, which seems like an okay size for most people and environments.

I did a little deeper digging regarding the motor mount. Its only "faults" / disadvantages seems to be that (naturally) it does not fit all motors, but seem to work well with for most 63mm motors (??). It is also not symmetrical, making it a bad fit for dual rear or dual front drives. It should however work well with a dual diagonal setup.

I installed a HK motor mount on one of my eboards and it hold on very sturdy, its been about a month now and no complaints, very good mount for the price and make sure you have caliber trucks to install it on, may not work for others, the only other trucks it works on is HK trucks.

hi, l have 2 like theses,  they work great on 8s+  why pay 300$ if you can pay less but 
only time will tell if they are reliable  but a great cooling is the key and don't drive them at full burst 
they come very fast hot

i also bought one kit,
but in the second ride i changed the bearings for a RED BONES. for me made a huge difference.

i am still running a 6s 5000mah(iÂ´ve already bought a 10s 6000mah like they recommend).
in 6s the max speed that i got was 16kmh, which for me is too much slow

soooo i had to switch to a motor that i borrowed from a friend of mine, a 220kv 6355.
now i can get the max speed of 33kmh. It is insane.

Read it boys: @PennE lives where mountainbike was invented. Mount Tamalpais, the very cradle of that sport, the steepest mountain on the bay area. That's the place where he tested this HB VESC.

as you can see the length between wheels is basicly 15cm
this isnt the original motor that comes in the kit, this is a little smaller than the original...

this is the wheels and trucks that comes with the kit

if want another picture just let me know

Hey, So i am still kinda confusedâ€¦ the HK pulley set does not come with the retainer piece that goes on the outside of the wheel , hence if im buying it, I should also get the "motor mount cover with bearing" setâ€¦ cause it has the retainer pieceâ€¦. some light would be appreciated cause i am about to put the order in!
Cheers

Some things to note about these pulleys is the wheel pulley is something like 25mm wide?
I used a couple and cut them down to 17mm to use with 15mm belts.
They have 4 holes and do fit abecs, a retainer can be found on thingiverse.
https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1003206
You then just have to buy bolts.

The pulley kit from HK is average tbh.  They are both aluminium and while thats not really a problem if you are trying to save weight, they will wear out faster than a steel counterpart.  The kit comes with a motor pulley @15 teeth and a wheel pulley @36 teeth, a belt and a motor shaft key (which is the only reason I have 2 sets in my shop)  What it does not come with is the wheel outer ring and the bolts to attach to the wheel.  Annoying if you just want to attach to your own abecs.  
I'm currently running the motor pulleys on one of my set ups and they have been good for the last 6 months of constant daily use so thumbs up for the pulleys.  No reason to think the wheel pulleys won't hold up just as well its just that you can't seem to get the whole bolt on kit as one.  The motor mounts are pretty crappy though and I would not use them at all.  They are also just a single drive set up.  You can't use two for dual as they are all the same orientation.  You could of course mount two dual diagonal but thats just meh.  Hope that helps and please do not hesitate to reply if you need further assistance.  Daren over and out
