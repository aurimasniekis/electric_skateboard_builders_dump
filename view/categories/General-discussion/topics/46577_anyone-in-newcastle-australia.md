Just got my first board (ownboard) and am putting together a build with dual 6374s. Having fun cruising alone but would love to meet up with others as well.

P.s my other hobby is brewing beer :slight_smile:

Come down to Sydney for a ride if you feel lonely over there and/or join our Facebook group: Sydney Electric Skateboarders. We have regular group rides on weekends as well during the week. Always happy to see a couple of DIY boards within the crowd of Evolves, Boosteds and Chinaware. 

Cheers

Yeah that would be sweet. We have some routes around the city which are pretty awesome.
