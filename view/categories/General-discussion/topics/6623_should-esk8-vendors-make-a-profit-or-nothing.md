 I like the way hummies doing it, where he's not making anything on his motors. When they are perfected and actually know to be a good, he'll charge more for them. You let everyone be your businesses Ginny pigs, which is the same thing hummie is doing. But the difference is you want to profit on said Ginny pigs, instead of profiting once you know the quality is there.

Yeah I really like how the entire community is taking advantage of @Hummie .. congratulations to everyone ripping him off.

He's business is likely to fail due to the greed of the masses. The end result is there may never be a finished product, there will be no further developments and there won't be any warranty or service.. 

Unless of course he is willing to go into around 10K debt to fund his improved "steel" model and continue to feed the greed of the masses.

The true retail value of his product is about $499, expect him to increase his price or expect failure.

 I dont feel taken advantage of, I offered cheap prices.  My business strategy is to make everyone happy by getting them the cheapest most durable thing I can.  Word will spread and in the meantime I get feedback and I can make sure I'm doing things right.
My business is making these as good as I can and keeping the customers I get.   Maybe if I had a bigger bank account I would be in a different situation and not relying on the community so much and it would be different but I need the community to make these.  I rounded up the paypal bucks early for products that were unmade.  Thats asking a lot.  People here helped me get it going and I'm happy.

The last 2 years in the self-build ESK8 industry has been very exciting, we have seen lots of innovations & several "beta-style" products have become available to esk8 builders of the world.

**Products such as; HUB MOTORS, VESC, CARBON FIBER DECKS & CUSTOM MADE BATTERY DESIGNS**

There are a few forum members & (vendors themselves) who seem to promote the concept of paying/charging only cost price for the awesome esk8 innovations, they justify this mentality by saying that if it's a new product it might have an unforeseen fault and therefore the products should be sold at cost price only because they have not been thoroughly tested & may fail prematurely. 

Other forum members will argue that innovators & vendors need to actually make some profits allowing them to offer service & warranty... & to cover any unforeseeable issues that arise, such as parts being made incorrectly or missing shipments.... or maybe they just want to invest in larger quantities to improve the manufacturing process, improve quality & ultimately strive to lower retail prices due to bulk discounts from suppliers....  Some countries also require income tax to be paid by law and this must be added to the cost of goods sold to ensure they can pay the bill at the end of the year. Some people just want profitable businesses that will be able to grow larger & eventually achieve much greater things due to their profitability.

## **So what do you think?**

## Should ESK8 Innovators & Vendors give away their time & efforts for zero gain?

[poll]
 - YES, I want cost prices
 - NO, I want to reward the innovators
[/poll]

There are many people and many different preferences. The business and the customer don't owe each other nothing. as for your question, I think the best model for a business is what you are already doing. give the customer both options (and 2 different prices), because than you have bigger market, and it isn't cost more to give 2 options (maybe little more).
the business that will make the most money is the one that will know the most how to serve the customers (and the most efficient), and the more competition there is, it is truer.

Well. Nice we are going to have this conversation :-). 

I think every vendor should make a profit but if you are developing a product and is not 100%  market ready it is unethical to try to make 150% profit. 
after all the customer is participating in the development of this product and is FOOTING the bill. 

The vendors benefit from this community in more ways than profits, even this conversation we are having right now it can be consider a MARKE STUDY that otherwise a company would have to commission and pay and you will get it for free with better detail and market integration as well. 

In regards to the taxes, you can deduct all prototype and development expenses so that is not a big problem in the contrary it can benefit the vendor at the end. 

In the end a SMALL company needs patience and should be concerns with the mid/long term objectives and product. Profitability will get to you if your product are good and you back them 100%. But for that they need to be 110% market ready.

As Hummie himself stated he is happy with how things are going. You both run different models of business, period.

Who's to say what the furture holds but, I imagine long term, Hummies model will pay off and he will be able to point to why and where he made his decisions about design and durability.

I would gladly pay 30% more for piece of mind that a part works as it's advertised. As the industry is right now parts fail left and right and people are supposed to just ignore severe manufacturing errors.  If you sell a part that may fail on arrival it better be cheap as hell. If you sell a part of quality people will pay more.

This is basic economics, set whatever price you require to manufacture a reliable part. @chaka is doing it right, his vescs are more expensive but are also one of the most popular because they are RELIABLE. This is an expensive hobby, most of us want quality over price.

If you get flooded with orders and cant fullful-> raise your price

If you aren't making profit with high sales volume -> raise your price

Cost is supposed to balance supply and demand.

1. if you sell a product and make zero profit from it you will never, ever, make a profit.

So true brother, it's a great way to survey the market :slight_smile: 

So far the poll results would suggest that vendors (and wanna be vendors) should focus on innovating and trying to be profitable to ensure long-term viability. Let's see how it goes over the next few days.

I think in most cases people are willing to pay more & would prefer to pay more to an entity that appears more trustworthy & seems more likely to offer great warranty & service, quality products and has a long term vision of growth.

I have no idea what his current price is or what his cost is, all i know is he has said he sells them at cost price??. Maybe he is making a profit and just telling everyone he's selling at cost price because he thinks its a great marketing strategy.

I really hope he is making a profit & can use the revenues to help him rework & resolve the overheating problems in the next version... trying to be everyones buddy and sell at cost price only gets you so far.... at some stage he will have to tool up & scale up or bow out.

Exactly.

I know full well that when I buy from the DIY community, I'm not always buying a 100% tried and true perfected product. R&D is expensive and we as consumers and builders are footing a large part of that bill. How much I'm happy to pay depends a lot on how far along a product has come. 

I bought and Enertion Space Cell because it's had a good amount of real world testing and has been around for awhile. So I expected to pay a higher premium for it than my Carvon hubs for example. It's a great product, but it's earlier in it's development cycle. Jerry just came out with a v2.5 and teased a v3 hub and I've had my v2 less than a month. The Carvon is awesome, but I know that I'll likely upgrade it at some point to a later version. 

So yes, people should turn a profit, but also need to factor in the value of having the DIY community being part of their R&D department.

Okay so think about it. He takes a loss and gives you free stuff. That might work for a week or two and then he's out of business and than you can't buy any more parts from him. Enertion has some quality shit and if he goes out we all lose

It will not be long until large scale sellers get into this space and decimate the smaller players.

Consider Microsoft's example. They let people steal/copy their product for years to eliminate the competition.

Microsoft had other sources of revenue to fund growth but if they had insisted on making money on all its products all along then many don't think they would be as dominate or profitable now.

Smart vendors will offer some loss leaders to bring in customers  and keep them from straying.

Sure MSFT is not perfect analogy. They don't sell HW for the most part.

Can study any grocery chain or retailer to understand that all products can't be equally profitable. 

Retalers often give away some products to get customers in and then make up for it with some higher markup and/or higher volume on other products.

It is better for me if he give me all his 1000 motors and vescs supply for free than if he stop the business and I can't buy from him anymore.

I love what Jason is doing and i'm a customer of Enertion, because I compared his store to others and his store offers me the best value. If I would care about him doing better profits i would donate him money, but I already help him because I buy from him and he offers me the most competitive value.

@Hillso @CSN @Maxid  We all want cost prices of course! but all im saying is we should pay a couple percent more to not only get them at a fair price now but also years from today to keep the supplier in business. 

I am always happy to pay a fair price.  When the prices seem unfair to me, that is when i go and find an alternative or buy directly from the manufacture in bulk.

@chaka is the perfect example of this. His VESC is the most expensive out there (pretty sure it is), and yet people flock to him to buy it because they know it works and will keep working.

And since he has  built up such a good reputation, when he releases a new  product (like his motors) people are willing to buy them because they trust him. 

I could have bought a new motor cheaper from somewhere else, but i knew that when i bought it from @chaka I wouldn't have to worry about it. It would just work and he would help me if I had any problems.

It's the producers that have to think longterm and charge accordingly. 

Yes, I'd be disappointed if any of the main producers of E-board parts when out of business, but if Jason offered me a SPACE Cell for $100, I'd take 10 even though I know he's taking a loss. What price he sells his products for is not my call. Although I would ask, "are you sure dude?" and probably send him a bottle of scotch to thank him. He may also have an ulterior motive that I know nothing about. Maybe he knows that I'm going to meet and become great friends with Casey Neistat next week and convince him to slap an Enertion battery on his Boosted.

It's not what we (as consumers) want the vendors to make in terms of profit. It's what the consumers are willing to pay for a given product/service, and the vendors come up with products that fulfill that demand at a given price. You can sell a VESC for $50 (at a loss), or for $200 (at profit), it's your business. Your decisions. Some people here are essentially one level above hobbyists, producing small quantities at scale, but not expecting to profit. Just for the fun/community aspect of building something. Others are trying to build real businesses. Completely different objectives. There's no "right" or "wrong"...just different objectives. 

Ultimately the market will decide what prices can be supported. No one is getting "ripped off". No one forced @chaka to offer a certain price or a certain level of service. It's what he wants to do, and what he is doing.

I'm glad we can have this discussion. However, I don't like the framing very much. It's not that inovators shouldn't be able to turn a profit. They should be able to turn a profit, I don't think there are many people thinking they should never ever make any profit for their work in this all. But you shouldn't be selling an unfinished product at the same markup as a finished, tested and proven product. I think you need to prove the quality of your product before you charge massive markups.

Idk what your markup is, but without saying how much I paid for the same steez controller elsewhere, the 150% markup is wrong, it was more like 200% markup. If you paid more than half the price you sold them at originally, then you got ripped off from your manufacturer. And if you didn't, then you made a killer profit.

Chakas markup btw seems to not be very much, as when they were at $130 USD before he raised them, he stated that was basically at cost for him. So even at the $165 USD price, it doesn't leave much room for if people break them. But he's very confident in the quality of his product and his customers are too. So he can sell them will a slight markup and still offer a complete warrenty.

My point was I'm sure at the $130 ish price, your still making a decent profit. I would guess your paying around $100 a piece for the vescs, maybe less due to blowout sale you had where the vescs could get down to $80 a piece. Chakas cost more to make, partly because he over specs his components. That seems to have translated into a more durable vesc that seems to be able to take more abuse. Certainly, I did nothing different with the vescs from enertion vs chakas vescs. They were put into the same conditions (which you seemed to think of as abusive, and can see more now that they are), one set failed and the others still working great with no issues. And I don't need to say whose is still working. I believe @longhairedboy had a similar situation to me, where a bunch of enertion vescs failed on him, and in the same environment, chakas vescs worked great. Even if the design is the same, manufacturing and specking of components seem to have a big effect on the longevity of the vesc.

My whole point is, that going to a new manufacturer for the vesc which is unproven, I don't think it's ethical to charge a markup until it can be proven to be of a high quality. It's true that only chaka knows how many of his have failed, and the same with yours and you. But I believe that there's different phases of development that should affect what mark up, if any, you charge. This idea that you start at cost to get valuable feed back, and build a name which is recognized as good quality, is what chaka did and now hummie is trying to do. Once you prove your product, I think its a good thing for you to charge some markup. There are benefits to both the owner and the customers by charging a markup, when a product will do what its expected to do. But when it doesn't, it leaves customers bitter about the money they just lost, and then, tell your self this before going to bed tonight, "I just made a profit on someone elses loss". That's what happens when you sell an untested product with a markup. And that's what I think annoys a frustrated customer into making a show on the forum about it.

I think the options for the poll should be:

a) All items should be sold at cost with no markup
b) All items should be sold with markup, regardless of testing state
c) Items should be first sold at marginally small to no markup until proven, at which point a markup should be charged

I think C would win in a landslide if you did the polling this way... But you setup this poll to imply that chaka or hummie can't ever get rewarded for their work. I think hummie will make a profit, partly because hes the most honest salesman ever. There's no stunts like this poll to prove a point. He's telling people my motors have problems, they will break, ect... when they might not, because he doesn't want people to dish out $500 to have them be upset that they didn't do what they expected. He will get rewarded, it will take longer, but it's the most honest approach to the situation. And your poll misleads people into thinking there's never any reward for those who don't charge markups from the beginning.

I feel it should be something like this. If you are charging $100 for an item is should be costing about 65% to buy and it should have some warranty and testing done. After you pay the employees you should be left with 10-15%. Taxes and shipping should be added on at checkout. That has to be how it is done on a website because all the different country tax rates...

When I have a hub motor build I'll be going for Hummie's for sure, because, 1. I can trust the product 2. His prices are very reasonable. Also, it is easier for people to talk good about a vendor, a.k.a word of mouth, when they feel they are not being ripped off by them and that will drive more people to buy their products.

Also, it is easier for people to talk good about a vendor, a.k.a word of mouth, when they feel they are not being ripped off by them and that will drive more people to buy their products.

That's hummie business strategy right there in one sentence. Everyone knows how much they should be going for, and everyone knows that if you buy them, your taking a risk. Of all the possible issues he thinks could happen, I only have had one (heat), which is only a problem because I'm a heavy guy who lives in the middle of one of the hilliest cities ever. But it's good to be open to your customer about everything, because then they can make an informed decision and they won't feel ripped off if they don't work out, because the info was there, and markup wasn't.

But you shouldn't be selling an unfinished product at the same markup as a finished, tested and proven product.
[/quote]
 If someone was selling a finish product, take for example the VESC, it will need to go through audit by international Laws and regulation, concerning electronic and manufacturing process, that take time and money (a F...K ton of money), and at the end,a approve VESC will cost around 250 to 300 dollar. (that why china product are selling for so cheap).

Edit: And Yes vendor should make profit, to ramp up the quality of their product by putting more money in them. (it is a circle)

My thoughts exactly.
[/quote]

Ethics aside... the beauty of the free market is that bad products and bad businesses have a way of getting sorted out naturally.  If you are selling garbage, no matter what you charge for it, people will find out fast.  The business will have trouble selling their swag, and will need to reduce price, revise, or both.  What about the lost sales due to bad reviews/reputation?  Tough shit.  Fix it or die.  Welcome to the free market.

If you are a hobbyist and you are donating time and resources for the betterment of the community that is a personal (admirable?) choice.  Typically those folks already have a day job that pays the bills.  But if someone is doing it primarily to make a living, then why shouldn't they attempt to profit from their labor?  

If the gear any producer is peddling is inferior and/or more expensive for the same quality, like I said... the market will sort that out for them right quick.  We are consumers with choices.  I vote with my cash.  If you are producing quality gear and consumers feel your quality gear is worth the price you are asking... more power to you.

The market rewards you when you make a good product at a good price.  People line up to buy your shit.

Likewise, the market punishes you when you make a bad product.  People find out, reputation takes a hit, and sales plummet.

The louis vuitton example isn't particularly relevant. When people are motivated to buy luxury goods, status becomes a buyer want- it is hard to buy status without making unaffordable to most (which is what creates separation and thus status). A quartz watch, which costs $20, will always out perform a $5000 Swiss mechanical watch because the technology is better for accurate, all conditions time keeping. But people don't buy Omegas because they tell the time better, they buy them for status. 


Anyway, back to this topic. I feel the primary issue in the diy e-skate cost space is not the sellers. Under normal capitalist conditions, market pressures (supply, demand) will drive efficiencies and price reductions, the best sellers would survive and the buyers would be happy with the costs. But this assumes the industry isn't competing solely on price. If it was to compete solely on price, this would be great initially for the consumer, but the producers would under-sell each other until only the company with the deepest pockets or most efficient process (often aligned to size/ scale) remained. Then it would become a monopoly, prices would likely increase again and innovation would be less. 

I think the issue in the e-skate business is the mindset of all of us that are buyers are tethered to - we view it as a hobby, and our minds are programmed to believe skateboarding is a fun and relatively cheap hobby.  

The problem with this is that in the last 3-4 years, the tiny industry that has grown, has discovered that e-skateboards are more like a transport problem, and less like a kids hobby problem. Sure, the enabling tech for e-skates came mostly from remote control hobbies, but we stand on our hobbies, drive it for 100s of miles on crappy roads at high speed, and trust it with our health and safety. None of this is a problem for rc toys, drones, or really, even traditional skateboards (because they don't get pushed to that extreme). 

So we tend to budget for a RC + skateboard, but that doesn't truly capture the costs of increased safety, reliability, performance and range issues. 

When our suppliers cater to our cost expectations, we get hobby grade stuff. Sure, it works, but how long, how reliably, and at what risk to the human riding it are topics which flood this forum daily. 

If we framed this industry not as a hobby, but say as a legit transport device, we might perceive the costs differently. I'm using my board to commute daily. I've spent around 2300$ all up on stuff relating to it.  I could own 20 boards before it cost the same as my car. Then, if I compare ongoing maintenance and fuel costs, I could replace my board yearly and still come out better off. 

So I think the marketplace here is slightly distorted based on the immaturity of the entire industry. 2k for a skateboard is viewed as crazy. But only because a ton of people are sitting closer to RC hobbies or traditional skate board hobbies (because they are the connecting ideas), than they are to the realities what you really need or want in an e-skateboard. 

The fact that new innovative products are still expensive, and still tend to fail (because we are trying to keep the development and manufacturing cost down so much), creates this perception in the buyers mind of a lack of value. 

Anyways, perhaps the diy-estate veterans are the ones holding back this hobby/ industry. What we really need is sellers who create high quality, high reliability, high functionality, modular e-skate systems that can ship around the globe, giving the widest range of DIY-ers the chance to mix and match safely to design their own creations. The 'price' will be whatever the market allows it to be once those goals are being met. Sadly, that price will probably exclude many diy-ers who can't afford the cost hike this needs, until economies of scale, large increase in mainstream buyers,  and return on development costs kick in.

@magnetvox We'll said..

I think mostly not the folks on the forums of course but most folks only want it to go literally the last 1 mile. Sure, you don't need a $1k-1.5k board to go 1 mile. For the obvious commuters, a bus fair one way here in San Francisco is $2.45, you do that twice a day that's $4.90 per day x 20 days in a month x 12 months = $1,176 /year

Now factor in your 15 minutes waiting one trip and another 15 minutes another trip.

Using my eboard for commuting when I was working. I literally saved 5-6 hours per week riding and it's just much more enjoyable. Waiting for the bus or missing the bus is a waste of time :). The cost for a $1-1.5k eboard was worth it. That's the entire reason why I'm in this business. I was literally annoyed by the commute taking so long + climbing these pretty large hills in SF just to get to work. lol

RC, Surfing, Paintballing, Quadcopters, Cars -- You name it.. Any hobby will always cost more money then it's worth. But a hobby is more so a passion.

There are and always will be cheap components. But you get what you pay for. Some are ok with it and some are not.

just a few random thoughts as i come in at the tail end of the conversation.

i pay $80 each  plus shipping when i buy steeze remotes from maytech four at a time via ali express. 

also i'm totally upside down on the 7 builds i've been commissioned with so far because i mistakenly thought i needed to compete with other people's prices. I don't. I know that now. I was still looking at all of this as a DIYer and not as a builder of custom hot rods, and i was sympathizing with a lot of the above points. 


Also, warranty and customer service is critical right now because we're all still basically building and selling prototypes that WILL fail, not a question of if, but when. Time between failure is gradually lengthening, but we haven't arrived at anything approaching something like a car or power chair in reliability. So when something breaks as a shop owner i have to stand behind my shit and take care of my people. If we don't all do that noone will build confidence in either our boards or this new industry as a whole, fewer people will buy in, development will take longer or stagnate, etc etc.

@longhairedboy  has it right, provide a quality product with the service to back it up, and charge whatever you need to for that to make sense as a business. If the price isn't insane and the product/service holds up your business will explode. Anyone can make cheap crap, service and quality is the hard part.

but what could be done to make things safer? the big name brands are selling the same exact stuff the diy people are using in terms of materials and mechanical design.  the electrical stuff I'm sure theirs is safer than diy but other than maybe soldering all your connections and safely securing your stuff down the right way, I dont see safer or more robust stuff coming from the companies that charge the most.  evolve is easy to point to.  Have you seen the prices of stuff on their site?!  i was looking at their old carbon board that they're now selling.  500 us and that doesnt even include the 200 dollar battery door.  a set of wheels for 80.   Evolve is the biggest thing in esk8.  they invest the most i imagine.  I dont see anything safer or more reliable, I see gadgets and sexiness. 
  I'm not saying it's good or bad just saying that's the way the world seems to work as I see it.

In not disagreeing with you @Hummie. 

I'm not saying anyone is doing it better or worse in terms of safety and reliability, although intuitively my sense it's better in some company's than others, and that had more to do with R&D expenditure or just product release cycles than anything. I was taking a high level view. I probably left out the cost of customer service as a key point too. 

People are quick to point out the importance of service. It's related to the topic, because good service costs, and the community is increasingly expecting it. I'm always amazed when someone cracks open a boosted board and loudly proclaims 'that's all you get for 2k?? My $600 build is better than that". And then 3 posts later they are either highlighting how boosted' customer service is the industry benchmark, or they crucify a small scale innovator (like yourself) because they didn't get an immediate turn around on some problem. Great customer service is an offering differentiator which costs more, the more it improves. As soon as we argue customer service is critical, the lowest price argument is dead. Too different strategies. 

The sweet spot is in probably the middle, but having said that, as this industry grows there is room for all strategies. Some sellers will compete on price, some on superior service, some on global reach, some on innovative tech (you are this last one probably). But my original point was that there seems to be an unrealistic perception of what good quality plus good service plus innovation (R&D) should cost. My theory is its because we are coming from a toy-like perspective.

Anyway- back to the real thread question- do manufacturers deserve to make a profit?

Profit is just what's left after you subtract expenses from revenue. Profit can be reinvested to grow employees, better tooling, reinvested to conduct R&D, reinvested to improve supply chains, reinvested to improve delivery methods, used to pay off debt, or given back to shareholders (investors) as dividends. I don't think any of the sellers in this forum have shareholders (correct me if I'm wrong). If any of the sole traders here intended to make a quick profit and leave then I doubt they would even still be here.Therefore, why the hell wouldn't anyone here want them to make a profit... Given we mostly seem to complain about the standard of each of those things it allows them to reinvest in and therefore improve!

**If anyone is interested in the basic enertion strategy.**
1. We sell our products for more than they cost us to manufacture & supply to the end user.
2. We reinvest all the profit back into the business, increasing stock holdings, developing new products, hosting public forums, improving our systems & most recently employing people etc.
3. I have not taken a wage since the start. I work for free.
4. I would like to earn an income sometime within the first 5 years. To buy food & stuff.
5. The business needs to break even or ideally be profitable at the end of each year, otherwise, if it runs at a loss I will close it down & get a normal job - no warranty for anyone, no forum, no innovations.

no profit = no enertion

Yes, word will spread & you will get feedback. But you need to have your wits about you, you need to actively protect your ideas! You must ensure you have the capital to improve, re-iterate & re-invest in your next order!

**Let me try to boil this down further and explain what can happen.**

There are hidden issues here that most people won't appreciate unless they are in the business of small-scale manufacturing of products with Chinese factories who tend to ignore intellectual property if they think they can make a quick buck.

Most of these factories don't like doing small scale orders, for them, it's costly and has minimal profits. The factories run very slim margins and only make decent profits when order volumes are larger. Of course, they are well aware small startup business need prototype samples & small orders initially before they will be able to scale up and place large orders. The factories accept the low margins initially because they get two things.

1. Intellectual property
2. A new client that could end up being a big business ordering thousands $$ worth of products if they are successful.

**THIS IS WHERE YOU NEED TO BE CAREFUL**

If you don't sell through the products quickly & make profits allowing you to increase your orders quantities with the factory they might start looking at other ways to capitalise on your awesome new designs & they may start offering your products directly to your competitors. Which is what happened with Hummie & Jacob hubs.

Consumers might think this is great! Competition is always good right? We'll yes... It generally means there will be price pressure, two identical products in the market... So, of course, the consumer buys the cheapest one....

However this is a downward spiral, the innovation stops!! because now the focus is on how can we compete on price. Don't worry about improving the material quality or testing new ideas...  now it's purely about lowering cost.

We have seen this with the VESC. (Producing in china vs higher cost production in US)
We have seen this with Hummie Hub Motors & Jacob hub motors, that are both now being sold direct by the china factories who they trusted with their designs.

**Low Prices & Lower Profits tend to kill innovation & lower service standards.**

Finding the right balance is extremely difficult.

2k for a skateboard is viewed as crazy
[/quote]

I think this is a completely different issue with the DIY market. I view my eboard as a motorized vehicle, not a toy. It's by no means a toy. Going 30+ mph is not something you play with. I'm setting aside funds to finally buy leather everything and a full face helmet, cause this is a serious mode of long distance transportation. I'm not done my new build, but I'm already up to around $1500 is just parts. Quad VESC, quad hubs, this is about getting from point a to point b quickly, efficiently, cheaply (a full charge is less than 40 cents), and with fun. Something I'm working on is create a real vehicle. Up til now, many builds are really toys. The VESC helps a lot, features like traction control are important for safety if you talking about high speed riding.

Right now, eboards are not generally treated as my vision is. I don't run for carving, I ride for speed, the rush, and the need to commute. Boards today are not built for this with any sort of safety standards. The wheels are not good unless the roads are perfect or near perfect. There's not suspension, there's no back up breaks, we rely on a little motor or motors stopping you from flying down a steep hill. The industry will change and I think there will more focus on building transportation vehicles rather then a toy in the near future.

This topics not really about the cost though in the sense of what it should cost to make an eboard. It's about the markup of sellers of eboard parts. I think a good board should cost 2k+ IMO.

I have a great price at 75 each for the steel.  I'm tempted to be just a middle man and sell these for very close to that with the fantasy that everyone in the world will buy them and I'll get to see them fly by.

This debate is awesome. Too bad I came in too late. In the cold and heartless world of business, investments or anything passionate, supply and demand trumps all. That's basically the only way to gauge whether a business is booming. So what if a business make 150% profit from a certain product? In the world of capitalism, the market will correct itself and competition will pop up forcing him to lower his price. Unless of course you have a monopoly, but in this case, Enertion does not have a monopoly in the world of DIY esk8 products.

i agree. Its expensive to get all three and for people like me who are in their business infancy and who want to do all three its tough to realize that. Its tough to sit there in front of excel and say to yourself "Well shit, i'm going to have to charge [$something i personally feel is ludicrous but makes more business sense] to build these crazy things moving forward or i'm never going to get off the ground and attract more money or customers." 

every extra buck over cost of parts for these builds i have now has gone into trying things out and developing processes, and i fully expect it to be that way for a few more years. My shop will grow, my offering will evolve, i'll have better parts and better processes, but i'll still be eating sandwiches and working my day job until it reaches that critical point where i'm able to actually start keeping money around. @onloop is so on point with this. 

ITs hard. Especially with a small toddler and weird work schedules. And sometimes i want to give up. And sometimes i freak myself out going down rabbit holes of what-ifs. And long hours in the garage, late nights and missing my family suck too. But i know the ends will be so worth it. Or the whole thing will go up in flames, who knows.

As ESK8 gets more attention (and I'm oblivious because my world is the tech startup/video sector) but who sits at the top of the mountain? The founders of Evolve and Boosted? Are these guys living like tech entrepreneurs? I can see how Boosted tracked upwards through Y Combinator but that was awhile ago and I imagine there's a big gap on ROI between software and hardware. To vendors - is the end goal to have a venture capitalist pump in large cash flow to allocate resources to R&D?

Very interesting discussion, especially seeing the Hummie/Onloop dichotomy -- both are responding to the paradigms laid out in the original prompt. To me it's like comparing two marketing strategies -- Hummie's strategy is strictly word of mouth through honesty and low margins, onloop's is to take higher margin and reinvest in Enertion by taking DJI phantom shots of the Australian coastline (joke). 

As evoheyax has pointed out, the baseline here is that no business can exist without making a profit so the more interesting discussion is really around what the consumer should receive as a discount for being a beta-tester in the DIY community. Ideally the sale price for a beta product should be something like: cost + profit margin - R&D or testing costs.  

That being said, it's not like pricing is happening in a vacuum. DIYrs are feeling extreme cost pressure from the maturation of the esk8 market in general which is creating enough demand for larger companies to bring out more competitive products at lower cost. And as onloop mentioned, many DIYrs can't or have difficulty benefiting from economies of scale which means the bigger guys are already at an advantage on their component pricing. As a result, if DIYrs were to charge a fair beta product price they're probably going to have to charge above market prices (something LHB has mentioned). 

I'm really curious how things will pan out for the DIY community. There still are plenty of advantages, such as shorter R&D cycles, higher levels of customization, access to newer components, et cetera. Also, evolve and boostedboard and others make plenty of mistakes that can be capitalized on, for example, both teased new board releases at the beginning of summer and boosted froze sales for a while then too, and both companies were not shipping until the end of summer which left a huge vacuum for a couple of months at the beginning of the summer which I imagine is the biggest selling season.

 Unless its a bored billionaire who wants to see what i do with it and would stay the hell out of my way, i can't see a scenario that would work. Between that and what i mentioned earlier, all of these things  make the right investor for me almost mystical. They would have to really get me and what i'm trying to do and not be trying to get an immediate return at the cost of my mission. 

I could probably deal with a business partner though as long as they did their stuff and used their money on their side of things and we invested equally in both time and money and were both equally on the hook for stuff and were both hell bent on growth and development. 

I can already see the arguments now though. "Why are you always ordering the most expensive stuff possible? So and so makes a similar thing and its half the price.", "Why are you doing so much of this yourself and not outsourcing literally everything?", "Why don't you have your own parts made already?", "Seriously? crushing your own glass grip? why don't you buy it?", "Why do you spend hours hand staining and detailing with a tiny brush?", "Why don't you have your own branded wheels? Crap Co will slap your label on them for hardly any money.", "You can't offer a warranty like that and keep any cash. Why are you doing it?", "Why don't you buy cheaper parts in bulk and lower the total build costs over the long run?" 

because fuck you, that's why. Now get the fuck out of my shop. lol

II feel the same way. You can't let someone limit your creativity. One of the interesting things about eboards is that everyone has their own style, their own ideas. enertion's deck, lhb's, chakas deck, my skyscrapter deck, and now the veneer pressed hallow deck I'm working on. Everyone has their own creativity, chose of parts, materials, and design. And youhave to either fund yourself or work within an investors guidelines...

this is an interesting discussion and first time feel like i can contribute from experience, rather than being the one trying to learn as much as i can like a n00b!

i kinda believe that eboarding ** could ** change the way people commute in cities. That, escooters, and ebikes. The problem is the cost of all 3 for the average consumer is too high. Until it becomes affordable and easy enough (and safe etc), the mainstream won't adopt, and the niche will always be a niche, albeit a fun one!

I don't really care either way btw - there are enough other hobbies out there to keep motors & batteries etc in production for me to be able to keep doing it...

currently online search traffic for electric longboards is about 2% of total longboarding traffic [This is a good proxy for demand], from 2 hours of my time researching and doing some spreadsheets. so it's not even in "early adopter" stage yet, it's still stuck in "visionary" stage.  for more reading on this, [start here](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=adoption+curve&num=100&safe=off&espv=2&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjawaSP07XOAhWLWxoKHWLjDFoQ_AUICCgB&biw=1920&bih=1085#imgrc=_) - there are some nice pics to explain.

bottom line: we're no-where near "peak" eboard.

so the only way for the mainstream to adopt is a) to increase awareness, and b) to continually innovate so that prices keep coming down, until that adoption inflection point is reached.  we're not there yet for either.  we bemoan the cheap chinese products, but they actually help increase demand.  we shout at the guys like @longhairedboy who sell at high prices, but that actually creates aspiration.  we think @onloop is a BLOODY AUSSIE (sorry dude, i'm a Saffa and I will never support Aussie rugby even though I have family in North Queensland!) and a bit of a direct hardass, but he's trying to build a sustainable business.  we knock Boosted Boards "because their boards are expensive & lame" - but guess what, they're the only brand that [Casey Neistat](https://www.youtube.com/user/caseyneistat) talks about, and he gets more YouTube traffic than everyone here combined, and then 10x more [someone correct me here - maybe he has profiled other boards, but afaik he is credited with helping Boosted grow through the awareness he created].

all of these ingrediants are important.

so now we're back to profit.

the only way we can keep driving those prices down, increasing awareness, and creating aspiration, for more of the mainstream to adopt, is to keep innovating, and that requires profits.  because you can't do it in a vacuum, and you certainly can't scale it enough to grow with increased demand.  one of the key things I've noticed in my short, brief, but INTENSE love affair with this crazy global niche is that pretty much everyone who talks about it moans about how long they have to wait for parts.... agreed?  the business reason for this is that none of the guys selling parts have the capital to sit on enough stock to a) keep a ready supply of stock available, which means more topline revenue, the result of which is b) driving down their own cost through better volume margins.

so i think everyone who sells this shit needs to make a good profit. at least good enough to re-invest and make the time not become enough of a drain on family, finances and energy, that the innovation stops.

and then secondly, guys like @RunPlayBack need to get more support, because it's his video work which is going to create the next youtube 2 Gazillion views video, to compete with Casey, and that means mainstream attention! Then everyone is definitely going to have a supply problem!

bottom line: do what works for you, live long, prosper. 
but don't moan when someone is trying to make a healthy profit. if you don't like it, shop elsewhere! 
for the guys that are trying to make a profit and build a business: keep going, grow your margins, grow your supply, re-invest, eat ramen noodles, and never give up! 
for everyone else, find the best deal you can, but support the guys who are making it happen in any way you can - but mainly by getting your mates to buy boards from you!

my rant over.

**** just in case anyone thinks i'm a capitalist pig, here's why i have this opinion:
I built an ecommerce business from scratch, over a period of 5 yrs. it grew fast, very fast. i raised a lot of cash, but not as much as the guy from Uber ;-) i had 45 people, an executive assistant, a 10,000 sq ft retail space just outside London, we got up to £23k per day. and then we closed it down. i'm still recovering. eboarding is helping me recover.
i learn't a lot, mainly about people, investors, fundraising, money, and **profit**, not in that order. there's a lot more to the story, but the take away here is that i've been through the same steps we're talking about now, and i have the battle scars to prove it.  the only way you survive long enough to enjoy the good things is to find your way to consistent, sustainable, predictable profit.

Great insight, especially in regards to CN and Boosted. He's also an anomaly, a once in a lifetime personality that can fuse tech and lifestyle in an engaging way. More importantly, he's capturing genuine moments in real time which is almost more valuable than the slickest, most highly produced and edited eboard video out. It's a big reason why I edit almost immediately after a ride because I'm just going off emotions and instinct. And while I truly love ESK8, it isn't the only thing I'm interested in so finding that balance is key. It's how ESK8 meshes with the unknown or seemingly mundane situations in our daily lives that actually creates more awareness than posting about parts every day. Most people can't make an instant emotional connection to a part but they can when they see real people doing real things.

Something i've noticed since i raised my prices: Once people see my boards and realize what it is i'm actually doing, they stop yelling and start asking legitimate questions. Even at my price point, people realize that if you want something made specifically for you its going to cost more to build and service over its lifetime.

think the commercial element to this which hasn't been discussed, is that every builder should be aware of the market segment they're going after... and what the pricing tolerances are there.

someone buying a cheap chinese board on amazon / ebay isn't looking for a £1200 evolve GT
someone spending £600 on a single motor custom build probably isn't either.
someone spending £1000 on their own dual motor build wants better performance than an Evolve, and their own "style"
someone spending £1300 + wants a completely different experience to the amazon / ebay board.

but the volume is in the middle of the market; customer service issues at the lower end of the market; and unpredictable volume at the top end of the market.

so price and build accordingly, and communicate often. 
know your customer. 
but don't be afraid of pricing to set your customer segment (so long as your product is worth that price, of course!)

hth ;-)

I think I commented on this thread awhile back agreeing that vendors should make a fair profit, especially when innovation and R&D is involved.  I wanted to check this thread again since this topic got discussed in a thread I started a few weeks ago, and I still stand by that original comment, but what I just can't stand is where some items (not only, but mostly battery packs) are marked up to just an absurd amount.  I understand it takes some time to spot weld and do the wiring, but when battery cells are gotten for around $3.50 a piece, and then you have packs with 36 cells going for $500 or 60 cells going for over $800, I find that to be an obscene markup.  That works out to about $14 a cell,  or basically a 400% markup on a few hours labor, where no innovation or R&D  is involved.

its not just about the cells its quality of materials used and technique used by the builder, you are not paying for cells you are paying for someone to custom build you a battery with knowledge and technique that they have aquired with experience. That is valuable and so is their time so ill gladly pay a premium for such an important part to be build properly.

You would not be my client, for the simple fact that you don't see what it is you are getting when you buy a battery from me, you get customer support, warranty(depending on weather it is purchased or not), time, quality components, and a reputable seller. Now if you wanted you could build one yourself, most people can't go with this option because they don't know how or have the tools available. You could buy from someone else but you will pay roughly the same price. You have to see it like buying anything else custom it is usually more expensive but depending on who you buy from can be an amazing purchase. Cells are just a part of what goes into a battery pack, its not like we are making hundreds at a time...

I never said it was just cells, but the other components costs are nothing compared to the cost of the cells.  The nickel strips, wire, shrink wrap, and other parts are very very cheap, so the main determination of the cost is how many cells are being used and that is the main thing you are buying in a battery pack.  You don't buy one for the nickel strips and shrink wrap, you buy it for the cells so it can power your build.   Also, I mentioned that it takes time to build these, I didn't say that there shouldn't be any profit made for these, but that the amount they are marked up is way too much.  You say it takes skill and technique to build these.  Well I totally agree, but I spent less than 2 hours on YouTube and forums and I now have been able to build battery packs that look every bit as good as the ones I've seen for hundreds more.  No I won't be a customer of yours, but not for the reasons you mentioned, but because I did the research and learned how to do it myself because looking at the cost of buying a battery pack from a vendor vs getting the required tools and material along with all the cells and everything else I needed to build my own battery pack still was less than what I would have paid going through a vendor... and now I have the tools to build all the packs I want so they'll be even less now, and I could potentially build some for my friends if the need should ever arise.  That's why I went that route, rather than purchase from a vendor.  Also I don't see why y'all are coming off angry at my comment.  I made a comment that was perfectly in line with what the thread is asking and I didn't bring up anyone specifically, nor was I rude about it, so I fail to see why that's something that merits that kind of response.

Also I used two example of cost for battery packs and they weren't yours, so I don't even know what you charge.  I said I think it's fair to make a profit, even for battery packs, so for all I know, your prices may be reasonable to me.  It's just the prices of the ones I quoted were definitely not reasonable in my opinion...

Like said, your paying for their knowledge, service, warranty, and simply convenience. It'll cost as much with the tools to build one, so if your only building one board, the costs would be about the same and then you don't have to worry about messing it up.

Now I agree, that I would never buy battery pack at these prices, but that's cause I have the skills and knowledge to do it myself. If I didn't have the intuition I have, I wouldn't try, because it is risky. You need to do it right.

Now about the hostility, I don't quite get that... I think maybe this:

[quote="uigiroux, post:107, topic:6623"]
what I just can't stand is where some items (not only, but mostly battery packs) are marked up to just an absurd amount
[/quote]

Might be misleading. You leave out the bms cost, which can be $80-100. I believe it should take about 3 hours to do a good battery pack. At $20 an hour, that's $60 in labor. Power switch, copper, and other parts could be another $20-30. 36 cells at $3.50 a cell is $136. So $325 at cost for a complete 36 cell pack is reasonable. So selling for $500 at that point gives a profit margin for the business to deal with equipment costs and validating your warranty if something happens, and for growth.

Not trying to argue with you, just trying to shed some light on the numbers.

Thank you for not jumping down my throat.  Normally the things listed would be included, but the battery packs I'm referring to don't come with a BMS, or an On/Off Switch with the anti - spark and all that stuff, I'm talking about battery packs that are literally just the cells put together, a xt-60/90 connector, and the JST Phase wire connector.
