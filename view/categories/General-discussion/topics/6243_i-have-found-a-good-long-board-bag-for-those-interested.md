So when I was ordering my long board I found it kinda hard to find a good long board bag. I ended up finding a nice one from a UK based company and if you are looking for a good long board bag and live in the UK this is a really good choice in my opinion. Now I will say I have only had this bag for a few months  but I'm really happy with the quality. 

Any ways here is the the link to the website: http://spiraluk.com/category/board-bag

And Pictures because those on the website are not that good. 

btw feel free to ask me anything about the bag :D

Looks fantastic! From the dimensions it looks like it'll fit most longboards.

Just have to see if I can find one in the US.

It may fit a child sized snowboard but nothing bigger that that my longboard is only 39.5 inches long and it takes up most of the space in the bag because the bag is around 44 inches long. So I would defiantly avoid using this as a snowboard bag unless you have one that is 44 inches or less.

I think @Michaelinvegas was saying that snowboard bags can be used as a longboard bag, not that this bag can be used as a snowboard bag

I've been looking for something that was more backpack style, and, if your board is under 100cm long, Field Hockey bags are perfect https://www.akprocanada.com/collections/bags/products/grays-gx9000-field-hockey-stick-bag
