Hi,

I bought these wheels:

https://m.vi.aliexpress.com/item/32829865546.html?trace=wwwdetail2mobilesitedetail&productId=32829865546&productSubject=32829865546&shortkey=7fEFRV7j&addresstype=600

And the ones with gear on it are too wide to fit my caliber ii trucks. Any of you had similar problem? Is there any workaround except asking turner for help?

Thanks![IMG_3493|281x499](upload://gWuRmqOcz1ZYGYCcHy6PIOIAZX5.jpg)

Have you put in the bearings and spacers?

cut your hanger - it's what had to be done to use enertion pulleys with the extra bearing since like forever and can easily be done by hand.

I hate to destroy brand new trucks, I thought about finding turner and asking him to bore little deeper into the wheel. But don't know if that could be easily done.

There is none. You can't change the wheel so it has to be the truck. The time you spent discussing this would have been enough to cut your hanger. The hanger will not look "new" 10 seconds into your first ride anyway. Just cut it.

I've spent about the same amount of money on bushings as the cost of TB trucks they are a really good solution.
