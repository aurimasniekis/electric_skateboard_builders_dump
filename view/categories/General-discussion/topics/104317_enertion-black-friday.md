The raptor is crap. Motors and focboxes are good though, I've had the motors for around 6 month now. They dont get anymore hot imo than duel sk3 6374s. Motor sleeves rip up fast though.

Been waiting to get some customers support for 3 months. Sent me 2 dead focboxes to clear their inventory. very unscrupulous business ethics. You don't need this type of company in the game. Karma is a b**** what comes around goes around
