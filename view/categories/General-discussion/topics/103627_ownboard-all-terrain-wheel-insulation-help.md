Hi  I ordered the all terrain wheels for my ownboard!! hub motors!! problem is they dont come with any instructions on how to hook up the electric? I'm pretty good with building things and electric but this is beyond figuring out!! does anyone know if there is a video or an instruction manual out there on how to do the electric work on this thanks!!!
