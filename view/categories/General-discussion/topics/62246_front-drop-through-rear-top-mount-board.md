I've seen a few guys doing this. I am currently top mounting a drop through deck and I kinda want to do the same because I don't really like to see the hole without the truck in it (don't care about the rear) and I'm a bit concerned about durability of top mounting a drop through deck. Does it affect ride feel or stability? Or maybe I could go full drop through but that'll leave me with about 15mm of clearance between the motor and the ground
