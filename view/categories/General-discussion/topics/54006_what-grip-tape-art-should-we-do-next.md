Hi we have done a ton of different grip tape ideas and just finished another amazing grip tape so time to start on another and want to get an idea for the next one and I am thinking maybe batman or spider Man or iron man, thunder cats, or king koopa, or a cobra? I have a million themes to pick from in my head but want to hear from you guys!!!! Here are some pictures of the most recent work to maybe strike up an idea! Let me know what you think and what ideas sound cool and I will get working on them this week and get it up on here and YouTube at BUFFALO ESKATE for anyone interested to follow along!![IMG_20180430_084322_485|400x500](upload://4n883O0G9QOfHHPNqa4HvrqNAEs.jpg)![IMG_20180430_211938_912|500x500](upload://OgZaSdvZDgMxzHBIfdMumNHy1F.jpg)![IMG_20180430_083110_022|407x500](upload://gotwOHw5Fc2zbXjYbSwezxtHIpH.jpg)![IMG_20180430_211219_243|500x500](upload://rxgRCwW300qoF5KrwpVRHIrGWSd.jpg)![IMG_20180312_174451_436|500x500](upload://9EjtDXMyNRAXJXKjiGUuYv4M4mE.jpg)![IMG_20180416_025536_064|500x500](upload://oIwUunCP7P4HlmEhrYBinnQiLIu.jpg)![IMG_20180208_064034_199|690x453](upload://eOhWKCqto67nYOJtY6aepb0vCa6.jpg)![IMG_20180428_030126_745|434x500](upload://yB3HZMON58qkqo1aOgM3E0OF5Tz.jpg)![IMG_20180312_165955_993|400x500](upload://oeky3qJLyaiW9iAeUB4CV4LKrhP.jpg)

@Mountchristopher the boards look great,
Nice work!  Pls consolidate your ideas to one of the posts youâ€™ve made, these are becoming duplicative.
