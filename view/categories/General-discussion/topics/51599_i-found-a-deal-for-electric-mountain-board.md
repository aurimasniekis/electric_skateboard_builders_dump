Let me cite Sir John Ruskin here for you:

"It's unwise to pay too much, but it's worse to pay too little. When
you pay too much, you lose a little money - that's all. When you pay
too little, you sometimes lose everything, because the thing you
bought was incapable of doing the thing it was bought to do. The
common law of business balance prohibits paying a little and getting a
lot - it can't be done. If you deal with the lowest bidder, it is well
to add something for the risk you run, and if you do that you will
have enough to pay for something better.‚Äù

dude, buy it, get it and then have fun with a broken arm because of locked wheels, ESC failure or other problems.

i heard even about some meepo or mellow boards were the motors just locked up and people fell from their boards for no reason.

it is not about low prices - it is about quality, electric quality, software and so on..

why do you think these guys can sell their stuff so cheap, because they have a fully automatic industry 4.0 production?

So, this is more about exposing diyeboard.com
They won't ever admit anything and are essentially protected by forum rules. 

The whole a vs b grade discussion started getting on my nerves a while ago and I asked for photo evidence of this difference in quality. They claim using higher rated fets for their escs, better quality trucks but when asking for evidence beyond just words, I got nothing. Give up. Choose with your wallet.

Buy at your own risk.  Don't expect someone else to help you fix it for free because you wanted to buy this trash.  In fact, just ask the courier to put it right in your trash can instead of on your doorstep when it arrives.

If you buy this, I can only assume you are going to end up like this this guy. And I don't want that to happen to you. Forgetting your remote, helmet, close toed shoes, to buttons of your shirt, dentures. Trying to do a sweet Ollie in front of the kids at your local skate park on a shitty electric mountain board that probably costs less to make than the shipping cost. Put the wallet away. You're gonna get what you pay for. Little to nothing of value.

Some of these super cheap Eskate setups are cheaper than I'd be comfortable paying for a non-eskate complete.

Even if its a good value for some of the pieces, everything else it comes with would be garbage.

I like the idea of browsing to find a good deal. The only problem with esk8 is always price. Half of this site is actually all about group buys, aliexpress link, bbox, escape, hobbyking, etc. I belive all members here look for price cut in an very agressive way. Yet if no one buys it or review it, you have to suspect there s something wrong there.

Personally I have bought plenty of esk8 part in ali. Imported few things this and that, they are not cheap either. If you ask me does they work, yes! Do they do their job, yes! But not in perfect condition. Bended axle, not aligned mount, bad gears cutting belt, etc. In the end, they sit on my garage as a shit show reminded how to cut cost becomes unrefundeable cost.

PS: if you buy quality parts, you can sell it back in the forum. If you buy from ali, good luck üòÅ

funny you guys trashing china and the far east when infact you'll find 99% of stuff is actually manufactured/made there! especially electronics! just because something is lower in price doesn't mean its lower in quality, many factors are accountable if discussing difference in prices! for example, mass manufacturing, greed, paying for a 'brand, ect.... this whole conception of if 'its made in china it must be crap' is absolutely tiresome and short sighted...

I personally don't criticize ''China made'', but rather the obscure way some of the distributors market the low-end products and components. They consistently omit important specifications that all have a big impact on performance and stability.

Typically, things like:
*Motor KV,  Watt, size
*Li-Ion pack cell type/amps
*ESC constant and burst amp rates
*Rider weight (what decks are compatible with what weight)
*Exact deck composition (often lies)
*CNC manufactured components? They often use imprecise cast components.

A beginner comes in, looks at the pretty marketing BS and will most likely make the wrong purchasing decision. Other than complete kit builds, their entire mantra revolves around offering parts that essentially are only a fit when combining it with other kit components. Otherwise, the gearing/kv/BMS/Li-Ion are almost always incorrect/inefficient.

Of course, China also produces high quality stuff..but these components are aimed at mass manufacturing at a low as possible cost, sacrificing quality. Since there is a demand for that stuff, it will keep selling.

I drove my Trampa for the very first time today after having driven over 1000km on my old modded china board. The difference is astounding. No clunking noises due to imprecise trucks, proper and stable handling, more efficient bearings...the list goes on. It is just worlds better.

Lots of quality longboard stuff is made in China.
But the best stuff still isn't cheap regardless of where it was made.

The problem is when you hit the lower prices,  you start running into things that are sold without QC, without research. A lot of it is copies of other peoples designs without the knowledge or discernment of what made it quality in the first place.

Good wood for board building has to ( generally ) come from the north, usually either Canada or Russia, etc. 
The cold climate literally is part of what makes the wood so good. Thats why there's so many board companies out of Canada. You think Chinese companies can source Canadian Maple cheaper than Canadians?

One of the biggest problems is low grade or ungraded hardware. A kingpin should really always be grade 8.
Grade 5 is tolerable for smaller boards, but riding with an ungraded kingpin is like driving your car around with a few lug nuts missing from your wheel.

Another notorious problem with cheap skate equip is people blowing out the pivot cup or the bushing seat, which can be catastrophic.

You have to know what it is that you're doing when cutting corners, otherwise you won't know which corners are safe to cut. And that sort of knowledge usually drives up prices.

This needs to be highlighted! However try to keep the tone down, we don't want arguing about chinese stuff in this forum. It doesn't help. I'd say leave the decision to the buyer, we make suggestion and don't stand in someone else way of doing. It's their money, their body and their decission. No one reviewed that board too here anyway, so let someone give it a chance. We keep it peace and quite, ok.

A Brand usually has a certain ethos and good brands put a lot of effort into their products. 
It starts with the design work, based on years of experience. Team riders then crash test the equipment to the absolute max, giving feedback to the designer. A top quality brand will consider tons of facts when designing the gear, knowing all the details.
Materials are wisely picked, manufacturing is spot on an qc is done frequently to assure that the high standards are met at all times. On top of that such brands offer warranty, spare parts and customer support.

Selling on price point is the exact opposite of this ethos. You have litte to no clue about the product, since R&D is costing plenty, contradicting the aim to sell cheap. Materials are super low grade (something you will only see after the things comes apart). Casted alloy, low steel quality, low quality moulds, poor wood quality, toxic chemicals, plastic/rubber mix for tires, non genious & brittle plastic raw material, poor environmental standards, low social standards, etc. Customer support is non existing...The only way to cut prices terribly low is cutting every single corner you can.

Usually you get what you pay for and you get more back selling your used equipment if you invested into buying quala T. You can sell a used Trampa at 50 to 75% of its original price after one year of usage. The price difference is sometimes lower than the price for a low end product, having almost zero value after a single ride. Such products create a pile of waste, since they have no value after a short period. A top quality product is used for many years and has a second life after the first owner decides to pass it on to someone else. On the long run this kind of equipment is friendly to your wallet and the environment. Personally I avoid buying stuff that has no, or litte value in the first place.
If something lasts long it doesn't matter that it cost more to purchase. Time of worry free usage and cash back when selling 2nd hand will outperform initial cost savings big time very soon.
Buying on price point very often means buying twice...

Good point, almost forgot about spare parts. Good luck getting those for this mountain board if you did not purchase it from diyeboard and even then, diye buys those parts assembled. They don't have things like bushings in stock and essentially have to pull apart their trucks or make a special order for you, simply because offering spare parts for longlivety is not part of their business model. You bought their stuff. They already have your money.

Mind you, things like bushings have to be replaced often. 

Cast imprecise trucks is an absolute horror on top. You'd need a good workshop with expensive tools to fix how imprecise everything is. Then there is the overall design. Don't know what it is, but the trampa turns on a dime compared to this Chinese mtb, even though the trampa offers better stability at higher speeds..

The bulky plastic battery box is digging itself through the lawn, riding on a nearly perfect terrain (at least for a Mountainboard). Design flaws like that can only happen if there is no designer involved at all, of if you don't ride these things frequently in your time off. Imagine a serious impact to that box, exploding your 250-500Wh of charged battery under your feet....
