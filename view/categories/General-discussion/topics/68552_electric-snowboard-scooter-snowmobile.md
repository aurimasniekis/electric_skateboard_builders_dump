Hey guys!

As for must of us are getting into winter time soon, how cool would it be to build some kind of  electric snowmobile?

Like these ones.

personally i would love to have something to ride on, and maybe for the parents something that is really handy to drags your kids up the hill when it's time for some fun ;)

Any tips and tips and ideas?

snowmobile seems boring, id like to see an electric snowboard where you lean to steer

Ill ride them when i am in the right area :)

How would the batteries deal with the cold? I assume it will be fine

You would need a battery warmer, they can keep them self warm while running provided the enclosure has enough insulation.

From what I remember there was a gas powered snowboard that had a set of track in the middle of board. I dont recall what it was called but I expect the company is defunct.

Snowmobiles are fucking awesome! I've had an arctic cat 440, Lynx 600 and might be buying a Viking next year! 
Electric would be cool :)
Can't be hard to build one. Lot of space under the hood for batteries

i guess you just use the edges of the snowboard to turn should work, but thoose builds does not seem good in any way

It was crap, but not because of the skis.  The airless tires shrink a lot in the cold.  less than 60 seconds in 30f they just spin around on the hub.  I'm gonna try it again this year with standard 6 shooters and chains.  There's not a lot of lean steer but it is steerable.

prolly not well, better suited to ice or shallow drifts

6 shooters would be a much better match for this project. Urethane is so slippery when wet. How about 3 skies with one in the middle a bit further back? Would help with steering /stability on turns

That's not a bad idea.  I thought about using some MBS wheels but they don't do great in the ultra cold either.

Trampas 9" with snowchains is another option. It's an expencive set of wheels tho.. 
And mounting some semi round/oval solid tubes under the skees will defenitely improve steering. I mean just like regular snowmobiles do..

Deep snow, you say? Here is you're answer. I've wanted to make an Esk8 version of this for so long. If only someone with the skills and resources could make this a reality. @Duffman, @Nowind?

Haha I just screamed and freaked out to all my friends at a small pregame party before the club, because I e been talking for weeks about doing a truck-turn esk8 sled.  I never thought someone else would have thought of that because I own several sleds and always have, and I’m really into it. Not to be a dick, but most skaters are budget-folks haha, so I’d never in a million years believe someone thought of it first. Only difference is that mine is gonna go 45 and have a esc setting on remote for full instant torque because it’ll just skid-out like a big sled.   Skis will be further apart for shredding hills, and it’s gonna have a tank-style tread on the back twin trucks with quad hub drive motors and those will be linked with a track bar that they lean together for turning, and it’ll hang way out the back with different length tunnels    The skis will also have a track bar and maybe even an electronic stability damping system via control arms off a custom
Truck system.    So mine will be sick as fuck. I think I will prob invest about five to six grand into it cause I know it’ll be fuck as hell.

There’s a ton of companies that make those skis. There’s ones I found that have a little blade up the middle.  Looks promissomg and maybe more rider friendly haha
