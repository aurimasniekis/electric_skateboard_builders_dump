After seeing some really sick Jet Spud builds, I wanted to pick one up. After some quick searches everything was sold out, and the board was discontinued. So I called around to some custom deck manufacturers here in the US of A to gather some prices. 

Here is what I am going for:

7-8ply Canadian Maple Deck
Jet Spud 29" Shape
No Artwork to reduce cost
Black Underside?
Black Griptape

## Price would be around $45/piece with an MOQ of 50. So how many of you would be interested in a deck like this? I'll leave some pics below.

Yes, it is but you cannot purchase it anywhere. The board has been discontinued

I've tried a lot of boards since that first build but to be honest, even after all this time, the Jet Spud is my favorite. Really nothing else like it out there.

Have you tried a Bustin Modela or Bonsai? They are similar mini cruiser types of boards.

I'm not really a fan, I like the rounded parts on the Spud. Thanks for the recommendation tho!

I've been looking for this kind of board for a while. I'm down depending on how much shipping would cost to Canada
