Update: Comments on YouTube point to the Rayne Kyle Wester Vandal. The overall shape is a better fit to the board in the video, so I think this might be correct. Exactly why he's riding a Rayne board with "Santa Cruz" on the bottom is a mystery to me. Here's the board: https://www.muirskate.com/longboard/completes/61051/rayne-kyle-wester-vandal-longboard-skateboard-custom-complete


Right at the very end you can see "Santa Cruz" written on the board. I checked out their site, and although it's not specifically called out, this board looks similar: http://www.nhsfunfactory.com/item/11113685/santacruz/10.11in-x-37.16in-lockdown-speedboard-cruzer

Santa Cruz probably just footed the bill, but I did see a comment about Rayne being owned by Santa Cruz or vice versa

Led to believe he's using the  45Â° Roadrider downhills.

Was just watching/listening to the sound of Wester whipping by camera at same time plane was taking off (I live by MSP airport) and honestly couldn't tell the difference between the 2.  i had to rewind video after his first pass by camera, cause i thought i was just hearing the plane. 

INSANE!  but super cool to watch/listen.

It's actually 89.. not 83..

Edit : I missed the new 91mph record..
The old record was 83 if I'm not mistaken and Kyle had the unofficial one in the video above..

Max was first over 91mph & I have money on him going back to the top again before long. Dude has a super tight tuck and is ridding the narrowest trucks and board :checkered_flag:
