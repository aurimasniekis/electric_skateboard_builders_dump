Gotta get some protective gear before I finish my first esk8...what suggestions for budget gear do you have?  Hoping for pads and helmet good at 25mph for around $40...the stuff I see on Amazon doesn't seem to hold up at speed more than once and the good stuff goes for about 5x what I would like to pay.  I know I shouldn't cheap out on protective gear but it's better than nothing...which is what I have

Gonna try working with CF...worth making my own pads?

If you only have $40, then you only get a helmet.  A normal helmet we use is about $250.  A cheap department store styrofoam bike helmet (1 crash and done) is $20

How fast are you planning to ride?

My 2c: (dimes?)
- Helmet: minimum
- I'm a developer so a wrist guard is (while a pain in the butt) important. Wrist guards are snowboarding ones I believe.

The wrist guard really is a pain in the butt (no: I'm not wearing it wrong).

I had TSG basic protection sets a while ago from the GB and they were only $40 IIRC. You probably can’t find that price anywhere else tho. I still use the wrist and knee guards.

That helmet will work but at 25 mph if you crash and you hit your chin it won't be fun. I think your body is worth more than $40. It might seem expensive upfront but a medical bill will be much more than a good set of pads and a helmet. If you want budget fullface go with a demon podium or some other downhill mountain bike helmet.

How do you think this stacks against a podium?

Try finding gear on sale. I bought some mountain bike gloves and g-form knee pads for $90 on sale in Australia. That’s about $65 USD

I also have a thh t42, I think that’s the name. Quite a nice helmet and was about $70 AUD. One of the better budget helmets according to some reviews I’ve seen

That helmet looks good. I couldn't find very many reviews on it but if this article is correct it is cpsc certified (it didn't mention any certifications on the site selling it or on amazon though...)

For me, if im riding 50ft to the mailbox: helmet. Bare minumum.

Anything more, helmet and slide gloves. 

If I'm pushing the limits and really riding hard, helmet slide gloves and kneepads.

I'd find some old leather gloves, old cutting board, jigsaw and blowtorch/melt the jigsawed cutting board pucks onto the old leather gloves. These, as we instinctively try to brace our falls, will save most of your skin other than needing to buy a new pair of shoes at some point. 

Next, after slide gloves, is kneepads. Mine are shreaded, but they still work in a pinch. I have no suggestions for cheap, but anything even second hand is better than nothing.

Basically, if you have such limited funds, buy the best helmet you can and scrounge up the rest second hand from Craigslist, yard sales, goodwill, etc. Thats my recommendation.

I know pucks are better but I just can’t stand them...they feel wrong on my hands...also I have tiny hands so I couldn’t hold a phone or remote with pucks...how good are the contoured plates in comparison?

Zach, it's simple: skate long enough, you will hurt your wrists.  It doesn't matter how good you are, bud.

How important is shock absorbsion/padding vs abrasion resistance?  I got scrap sheet steel and that's harder than any uhmw plastic puck if it's an alternative

many reasons not to use steel for a puck; friction and heat being top-of-mind :) 

use bam bams, your friends will be amazed

just not in California during the drought :) stay stoked

Does steel have to much or not enough friction?  I'm not worried about heat...I wear wool gloves in summer...that What Remains of Edith Finch vibe

I while ago someone suggested learning to fall but all I found was falling at low speed...do you still tuck arms and head in then roll over your shoulder into your back when going 20mph ?

Not unless you can help it. If your all geared up you should be trying to slide belly down when going at high speeds. 

I have fallen at 60km/h took 2 steps and rolled. It ended with a lot of scrapes and bruises but luckily no broken bones. However, I do not think that would have been my best plan of action.

can pretty much always find elbow knee and wrist guards at your local Goodwill/St Vincent's de Paul or second hand sporting goods store.

I got [this helmet](https://www.sickboards.nl/en/helmets/5973-triple-eight-invader-full-face-helmet.html?search_query=Invader&results=4) from Triple 8

Some [kneepads](https://www.skatepro.dk/117-10579.htm) from Triple 8. Some people said they wasn't that comfortable but to me they feel okay. It will always feel a bit different with some protection.

Also got some [wristbands](https://www.skatepro.dk/116-24722.htm) (not those)
I just wear some stadard working gloves so my hands don't completely die.

A total of around 140 usd I think

**Strategize**

Plan for how you could fall how you would best and worse case.
I have strong opinions about things like Wrist guards but I'll lay them aside 
and let you think for yourself.

But just remember skill > extra safety gear
 (A helmet doesn't fall into the "extra safety gear" category because it's mandatory)

Thanks, most of my skateboard injuries are wrist related so I'll probably spend more on those first along with a helmet

There is no way that you can get some birthday funds more early?
I‘m sure your parents would support that.
Don’t cheap out on protection

I got $300 from birthday/Christmas/start of college combined and that got me as far as some nice motors and ESC...I'm on my own

They probably would spend more for protection stuff but then id feel guilty asking for more

Than find an evening job or something.
As min till you have like 100-200$ for a full face helmet that also hold up.
I think I don’t need to tell that shit happens most time when you don’t expect it.
Let’s say 150$ for a good helmet plus 50$ for a set of knee/elbow and wrist guards or something similar should be doable somehow.
If no, than you set your priorities wrong 😉

No need to feel guilty if it’s about safety.
And if you do than try to earn the money by your own, just don’t cheap out please.
