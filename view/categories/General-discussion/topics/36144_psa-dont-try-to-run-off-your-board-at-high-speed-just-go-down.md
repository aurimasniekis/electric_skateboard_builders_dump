So some background. I was at the enertion Raptor 2 event last night in San Francisco. Everything was good, we had raced already, reached our destination. And now we were heading back to where we started. Shorty after the turn around point, we were on a road that was not in good shape. I thought it had cleared up enough so that it wouldn't be an issue, but I hit a large crack at exactly the same time I tried to slow down quickly (to let the group catch up and help light up the road). There wasn't a street light where I fell, so viability was poor. So We I hit the crack, it made me squeeze the tirggers brakes slighter harder than I was expecting. The result, is I got throw forwards. I tried to run it off, but it was a bad move. I took the first step with my right foot, and the second with my left, which is when my ankle completely dislocated, followed by another with my right foot (which is un injured) and then straight to the ground. This is not how I would normally fall. Normally, I would take one full step with my right foot, one half step with my left, tuck my right shoulder down towards the road, and roll/slide out of it. But there was one catch. I had an extra lipo pack for the long ride in my backpack, to make sure I don't run out of juice, and keep power output high. I was afraid to land on it and cause a fiery explosion. So I decided at the beginning of the night to try to run off if anything happened. Bad idea. I was going around 25 mph at the time, and simply couldn't run at those speeds.

The result, my ankle pop out like a twig, tearing my ligament in the process. So now 6-8 weeks to recover, and an impending surgery in the near future, and likely a year or so before I am back to normal (actually better, since my ligaments suck. The cadavers are way better, and I know, cause this was my last natural ligament in this ankle, haha).

Moral of the story, is be careful out there, especially at night, on roads you don't know the condition of, and don't try to run it off if your going above the top speed you can run at on a treadmill. You will put extra force onto your ankles, and this can happen.

Thank you to everyone who helped! You guys are best!

head ligament brotha!!!
[/quote]

Funny part is I'm covered 100% above my waste in leather, with a tgs pass helmet. When I go to the skate park, I wear two ankle braces on each ankle, but not when I ride my eboard. Had I had these braces on, things might have ended differently also. There's at least 8 factors I've identified so far that where all in alignment for it to happen.

Late night (getting tired)
Dark
Unknown road quality
Too much speed for being unknown quality
Too relaxed/comfortable (let my guard down)
Not wearing ankle braces
Extra battery that I didn't want to land on
Still riding 83mm wheels instead of some plusher 90mm or 97mm wheels (@hummie :D)

Had just one of those factors changed, I might be better off right now.

The easiest factor to change is the 83mm wheels.

This one terrifies me.  Sometimes if I feel like my guard is down, I will pull over to the side of the road and hop off and think "this could be a crash, but it's not - pay attention dummie" then pump myself up and hop back on and ride away

Sorry about your injury. Wish you fast recovery. I recently went down also at 25+mph but had to do a couple steps before going down. Was just wearing shorts and t-shirt and without those steps my hands, arm, and torso would have been skinned a lot more. But, yeah speed at night is def not a good idea.

The road was terrible with big cracks. It was on the last leg of a fun night. The shit happened right in front of me. 
Everyone who rides at night need very powerful flashlights at least 450 lumens. Shredlights are not enough at high speeds. I hope you heal fast.

Just got back from urgent care. No breaks at least, but they confirmed that it sounds like my interior ligament is gone.

Take it easy at night everyone. You can feel like a pro on your board one second, and eating pavement the next.

I was wondering what you were talking about yesterday regarding a surgery that would cause you to miss performance day, now I understand üòê

On a lighter note, awesome video. The raw power your board is putting down is clearly visible in that video, that board is beastly! 120A battery and 520A motor at 12S  with a 200lb rider right?

I've done that before not going to lie , when I went from 10s to 12a was blinded by the speed and joy and well I was going 23 mph a when it happened and well I hit a small crack lost balance launched forward and well I ran off the board quite well , no injuries , I think it's because am a track runner and well a good one lol (6 years In track ) , my form and balance on point , definitely scary and I no longer go more than like 15 mph on night time

One thing I noticed in that part of the city is the bad shape of most roads. 100 year old brickyards. All pav√© street crisscrossed by streetcar rail lines. Accidents waiting to happen.

Anyway, get well. Hope you'll return to the streets in short time. üëç

Ouch!

I have learned that lesson (no breaking of bones etc, but serious bruises).

It was more of an automatic thing that needed to be rewired in my brain and after about 4 falls and wearing gloves with schapoid protection, I now instinctively just not bother to run, but to concentrate on landing to maximize sliding upon impact and apparently it is no worse than just simply dropping down from a stationary stand.

It all about forward momentum forces going through limbs which is not there in a stationary fall.

Get well soon. Looking forward to some of the upcoming large wheel size hubs.

Ouch....
Controlling your fall is a lot harder when holding anything in your hands, you allways try and protect what you're holding.

My broken bike and cracked tibia vs my unshaken McDonald's chicken dinner and still full n fizzy large coke proved this theory to me quite some moons ago.

Get well soon bro. ride hard fall softly.

I managed to run off one, but not at 25mph, probably closer to 21.  Trail with blackberries on 1 side, chain-link fence on the other and the board in uncontrollable acceleration.  Fortunately I had time to setup, so I kicked backwards off the board and landed on my feet, then ran it off.  Bruised my heel so bad that I couldn't walk on it for weeks, but otherwise ok.

If I'd been wearing gear I'd have chosen the blackberries, but shorts, t-shirt and a bike helmet.

In any event, yes, night riding presents a whole new set of risks and I'm sorry for your injuries.

Damn, that's brutal. I've contemplated the best way to fall at higher speed, and it seems like you'd be best to tuck and roll or slide it out, if possible. Obviously that's an issue when you've got a spare Lipo strapped to your back. This confirms that. Hope you have as quick of a recovery as possible. At least now you have plenty of time to wind motors!

And on another note, I'm thinking of adding a trunk or storage box to one of my boards to hold extra, loose small stuff, keys, wallet, tools, and more importantly, a spare Lipo battery. I always ride with my armor jacket, but it seems kind of dumb to have my backpack on over a nice slippery spine protector. Plus, being a human fire hazard with a spare fire brick attached to your back.

The more pads you can put in contact with the ground, the better.

Knees first. Press your pads against the street and control your slide.

Random note as it came to me in my falls. I used to skydive and you can pivot your body in the air to essentially "pilot" your body. 

Sliding across pavement is very similar in controlling direction of a slide.lol

Hope you heal fast @evoheyax! Sorry that happened to you. I did almost the same thing when @Moja came to Portland. I put a hug hole in my arm down to the bone and some pretty hardcore road rash down the left side of my body!!! Sucks because I've skated that sidewalk many times without any problems. 

I also just did a run out at about 15mph about 3 weeks ago and still managed to break my foot!!! Stayed on my feet the whole time too. I'm pretty happy with the bone breaking rather than what happened to you. Sounds like a long recovery. I'm already back to ripping the streets.

Yea this is more of a pain then a break. Just glad though it's not a break and a torn ligament.

Swelling better today. I can move it about 5 degrees where as yesterday, it was too swollen to move it at all.

Hopefully I can walk again in a few weeks. Just really curious if I'll be able to ride without the surgery. With my schedule. Next summer is the earliest I'll be able to get the surgery.

I broke my foot 2 days before my Raptor 2 got here and it just about killed my soul. I've been waiting since the second it started selling last November. But... Like the complete dumbshit I am I still rode that fucking R2 the day it got here with my boot on and everything. Hope you can get back to riding ASAP! I've been waiting as patiently as possible to be able to buy these hubs you guys are working on.

Thanks for this post. It's important that people learn from these kinds of incidents. Jake and i are all banged up but we're alive and unbroken because we follow these rules:

1) don't go into battle with a borrowed weapon
2) don't start a fight in a strange bar

Combined they mean that you should always know what you have, know where you are and what's around you (situational awareness), and know your limitations, and don't go outside those limitation in unfamiliar territory.

Amen, I've hit a pothole that crossed the whole road, looked like demons were coming out of the earth, threw me up in the air, but somehow rode through. Have a nice dent in the can of my poor Carvon...

I think there are some standard get-off techniques from longboarding.

The slalom (short, but somehow still a longboarding discipline?) guys were telling me, wear hard knee pads and practice sliding onto your knees. This can be done pretty reliabley, but can be a bad muscle memory thing if you don't always wear knee pads.

And from silverfish, I think Mr. Chris Chaput?, said if you have slide gloves. with practice you can fall onto your hands and toes pretty reliably and safely. Hard to deal with the remote though...

@evoheyax is your board up for sale? ;) Heal fast, need testing on those new wheels and tires!

Sometimes there is nothing you can do, like when a little kid darts out from between two cars chasing a baseball and you are carving at almost 20mph.

You can...
A: Run him down, both get hurt, have his dad beat me while I'm down then get sued, or
B: Try to run it out, realize you aren't a cartoon character then proceed to tuck and roll

I chose option B.

Falling on your hands and going into a roll is the best way of stopping. Fell going 32+ mph with only a helmet, shirt, and shorts. Only have a small scar on the bottom of my palm now however had bits of road rash all over my body after the fall. Wear gloves.

This guy demonstrates this type of fall pretty well at 1:25. He was going 40 mph when he fell. Go to 1:25.

Now that was a heavy fall... I wasn't like that though. I feel like if I had gotten thrown off like that, i'd be ok, cause I know how to fall on a normal street board at high speed, and usually, its cause in a rotation and/or flip trick, you down get the board straight enough to ride it out. In those cases, your lower to the ground in the first place. I was just standing up right when I got thrown off, and at 6 foot 1 inch, I'm a long ways away from the ground. Not using my feet would have been an even harder slam.

@longhairedboy why didn't your brakes work at 40?

i was going downhil and the force was too much, they gradually release the faster you go since you can only throw so much current into the battery. 

HAd i been on flats it would have been different. But i was already going fast and then a hill happened.

Another reason to do 4wd. Spread that current put among 4 motors. I can stop on the down of a15% grade hill going 35 mph with out issue.

I actually think it's a bit better to fall going down a hill than a flat because there will be less force when you hit the ground. When I fell it was on a kinda steep hill and I believe it helped a lot to get me into a roll. On a flat it would take much more force to get into a roll, therefore a LOT more road rash.

Not concentrating and over confident, without my gloves! Did have my helmet on, but it was hand or chin so hand took over. Was doing about 25mph and just started to wobble,

I don't care if you have 8 motors if the cutoffs are set lower (to protect the pack and prevent BMS shutdown from too high of a charge current) the brakes will gently give up resistance as it becomes too much for the pack to handle. i can brake at 35mph too, but apparently at 40 with a downhill load on my settings at the time they seemed to gradually give way. 

having more motors doesn't change the fact that you have to protect the BMS and pack from overcharge.

It's pretty much how you land that will determine your injuries,just accept it and fall off! 
I came off a motorbike at ¬£50+mph down hill,I hit black ice, the steering went wonky then I caught it back ,got it straight and then hit another patch of black ice and couldn't control it and accepted my destiny.
I slide downhill on concrete for a few hundred yards.
My girlfriends step dad was just about to pull out of the side road on his way to work but seen me fall off! 
He got out his car and by the time I finished sliding was at his feet,I looked up and seen his face and was like "alright dave" he was like..yeah..you!! Lol 
Just thought Id share an amusing crash story of mine üòâ
All I ended up with was road rash,apparently not tensing up and just accepting it helped!

@longhairedboy If your building a board for high speeds wouldn't it be better to bypass discharge like Jason did with the spacecell to avoid cut off?

I need my boards to shut down when the pack's dead. Completely shut down, not just kill the VESCs. 

Has the raptor been tested braking downhill at 40mph and above? i'd like to see it.

Iv had the same issues with brake cut off when I built my first pack from laptop cells ages ago so know the feeling of the brake cut off!! üò¨
Not had any issues with my spacecell though but iv not reached top speed downhill too busy where I live would put other people in danger!

And why you use lipos. I don't have this issue. If you rode my board, you'd realize that the brakes are extremely strong at all speeds, on any hill.

Just going mention this, but you guys are using the wrong cells also. There's a new li-ion cell I'm looking at that I could fit a 12s3p of in my current board, with 120a max con mooch rating, and not much bigger than the 18650.

Everyone in this industry follows like sheep when someone builds something new. Sometimes, you gota think outside the box and adapt to new solutions, and that's what I plan on doing soon.

If you found a good place to buy the 30T's share with us lol.üôè

Unless its something else, a 3P 30T pack can put out 120A but charge rate would still be only 18A total for braking (Assuming you are one of the people that wont turn your batt min past 2C or are limited by a low max BMS charge rate üòâ).

I haven't found a good place, but they look much more promising than the 18650s. I will have a battery pack ready for sale in the near future with these cells though :)

Now the next question and experiment is to determine whether charging over the recommended max current of 4A in bursts would damage the battery. Since the average braking time for most boards is probably somewhere between 2-5 seconds, I wonder if it'll have any affect on longevity. Now for edge cases like extremely long (.5+ miles) hills, I guess that would depend on what speed you are riding you brakes, since from what I can tell, full recharge current wouldn't be applied unless you apply full brakes at somewhere north of max speed. Even then, you aren't maintaining that recharge current for very long, so over time, the battery would see max recharge current only briefly. Besides heat, are there any variables that contribute to cell decay? If not, would pulsing high recharge current significantly heat up the battery?

My braking  regen currents have been set at upwards of 40A total for quite some time. I havent noticed any real degradation of capacity or battery heat yet but not saying it wont happen.

ATFL and CFL tear... likely AMA Grade III since this was the second to third time it's happened.
Damn man, you're gonna need major sx for that...wish you the best of luck and a fast recovery dude.

Is this based on your huge LiFePo4 pack? I know those batteries are a lot more lenient...I guess time will tell. It doesn't help that different chemistries react differently...and data sheets all say the same thing as far as charge rate is concerned. Battery university says it's ok though, as long as it's not in saturation charge. ( Õ°¬∫ Õú ñ Õ°¬∫)

Nope, I run those settings on my 12S6P pack. My A123 pack will be set for much much more lol. Just beacuse the settings are at 40A doesnt mean it actually seeing 40A of regen though. Ill do some hard braking on one of my logs so we can see how much current it actually gets and for how long.

Yea I'd do these tests as well, but I don't have a setup at the moment. But I do suspect that even if you set them higher than recommended, I doubt you'll see that current very often when braking. 

Oh btw, thanks for providing data for my questions! Gives a lot of insight for sure.

Ok, well it actually does see over 30A under hard braking but my voltage is still under max and that was the 1st lap around the block with a full battery.<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/3/2/325a93cbbf1e5481aabbfa669d4e4a1ef0428163.jpg" width="690" height="335">
