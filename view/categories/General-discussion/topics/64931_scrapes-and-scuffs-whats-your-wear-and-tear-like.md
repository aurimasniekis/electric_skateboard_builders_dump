Heyyy!

Just wondering - what scrapes and scuff marks do you have? I'm mainly interested in what the cosmetic wear is like on purchased boards such as Boosted and Evolve.

What marks do you have? I'm getting loads of scuff marks on my mount and trucks :thinking:

Front truck and back tail are pretty much the heaviest scuffed up things on my board, for obvious reasons.

My motor mount and motor. The motor extends out the back and I've leaned it up with the motor mount on the ground too many times.
