Hello guys, 

I really wanâ€™t more flexibility on my builds and i wanâ€™t to be able to print some enclosures / remotes / pulley for my friends and me. 
What should I choose ? 
I can invest a bit since I know for sure I will use it a lot. 
All advices appreciated

Either the CR-10 or new Tevo Tornado are both great options for under $400 and with the 11.11 and Black Friday deals coming up soon it's a good time to buy.

I'm also shopping for one. this hobby is getting so expensive but atleast a 3d printer can be used for something else.

Without a doubt go with the Origional Prusa i3... best starter printer. Great print quality and you can score the MK2 for $200 less with the release of the MK3

This printer seems to be the good solution. Itâ€™s just a bit expensive, but i think i can find a good deal. The baseplate seem very large, so itâ€™s cool to print large stuff. 
What do you recommend in term of software ? Iâ€™m a complete newbie in this field so i need to dig some soft to try n design some stuff ! Solid works , blender maybe ? Something free and not over complicated

there are some free CAD software just google it. I use Autodesk Fusion 360 <=== free if you're a student. I also own Anet A8, a prusia clone. This is a good option if your budget is 250 or under. TEVO is a better option.

Actually getting new printer tomorrow,

Yea it's a sick printer. I would be fine without the dual extrusion though for a bigger bed. I wonder if there is a mod out there to get a bigger bed.

I'd build my own DLP printer if you're after the best bang for your buck. Nothing comes close to a DLP in terms of accuracy and speed.

It's opensource so I don't think it's impossible. Just a matter of building larger enclosure and rails,belts

I used the dual to have 2 diff materials or colors loaded for diff prints not having to swap anything.  Never really used dual for single prints

I use a CR 10 and i can recommend it without doubt , you won't run into bed space problems and it works great even out of the box. The only thing i'd like to change is the Hotend, so that i might be able to print Polycarbonate for Pulleys etc.

Going to second you on the original i3. I built mine from the kit about five months ago and, save for a few hiccups in the beginning, it's been working perfectly ever since!
I'd say that with printers it is doubly true that you get what you pay for.
Since no one else raised the issue yet, let's talk slicing software: I use Slic3r and Repetier-host, both of which are free, both in price and hassle (for me at least). Slic3r lets me set up the print exactly the way I want it, and Repetier-host gives me direct control of the printer from my computer. Kinda wish Slic3r would do that to...

If you know Solidworks or similar, definitely use that! It's MUCH easier to fix mistakes there than in Tinkercad.

Fusion 360 is also free for makers and startups, not just students. You only pay if your "making a lot of money"

I get it free because i'm not making a lot of money.

not the monies at the moment for one, but iÂ´d definitely buy an original i3 too.
I saw a lot of videos and tests about 3d printers and youÂ´ll find yourself everytime in front of the original i3 again.
If youÂ´re really behind hardcore DIY and want to tinker around with them a lot, youÂ´re pretty much ok with an i3 clone too, but the hassle free version is the original i think. Latest version has some pretty dope features too :slight_smile:

It's a 30cmx30cm buildplate and 40cm height, so plenty of space even for large, segmented enclosures. You could even buy the CR 10 with a 40x40 oder 50x50 size.

Same here as with e-board parts. The cheap ones are not as good as the more expensive ones.
On this point i would go for original Prusa, now that i know about printers.
I have Geeetech Mecreator 2, and it is good, once i had to fix all issues it came with. :smiley: And i bought this box-style because i though it would be easy to enclose airtight, but in the end, best solution is just a complete box around the printer.
But yea, cheap printer if you want to get experience, expensive if you want it to just work.

cr-10, build an enclosure, get ikea 30cm mirrors, stick cheap hictop build surface to the mirror. Then ABS printing is easy.

Adding onto @High-roller point about slicers, I have always used Cura and it has worked very well for me. It's pretty simple and gives you a decent amount of control over your print though if you can afford Slicr I'm sure it's better. 

Oh and about reptier host I just use that for checking out GCode files because it's renders them very well and quickly. For actual printing I HIGHLY reccomended Octoprint on a Raspberry Pi and a webcam especially of your printer is not in your room or near your main computer. Funny thing is my printers are like 2 feet away from my computer though I still use Octoprint cause of the statistics, filament managing, webcam control, and file management among other things it offers.

I have a CR-10.  If you want an easy to use set up with a good community and support and a low cost this it he best printer IMHO. I think you can get them sometimes for under $400 USD, this is the way to go.  There really is no competition for this pricepoint and build volume and quality.  The CR-10 just works out of the box unlike some of the other product (i.e. TEVO).

CR-10!

even though i just have an Anet A8, but the buildvolume and the price is pretty much unbeatable.

the prusa I3 is awesome but price whise it only offers load of gimmicks and lesser build volume while costing 3 times as much.
