re: Evolve rear trucks: does anyone know if the Evolve strut is compatible with the Gullwing sidewinder II truck baseplate/truck arm?

Thanks

Gullwing Sidewinder truck arm (middle hanger) can be put on Evolve Supercarve trucks but don't really fit perfectly and I wouldn't suggest it except as a very temporary stopgap.

I don't know about the baseplate.

I have the gullwing baseplate and need to find out if one can mate the evolve strut/hangar (the piece with the motor mounts as part of it) with the middle "hangar" between the two king pins, if that makes any sense
