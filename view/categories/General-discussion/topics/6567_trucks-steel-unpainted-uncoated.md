Anyone know where I can find the type of trucks listed in the title? I recently learned how to weld in a variety of different ways and am now looking for trucks that I can buy to test my skills trying to weld on a motor mount.

Normally, all trucks are aluminum and most aren't steel. I think I was trying to look in the past but couldn't find anyone.

Caliber makes a bare aluminum truck.  welding aluminum is a few notches more difficult than steel.

I got the paris trucks and aluminum brazed them myself using $20 worth of tools. The video below shows how you braze aluminum.
