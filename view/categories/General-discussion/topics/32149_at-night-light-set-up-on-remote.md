Was thinking lately that it could be better to just toss a bright LED on my remote especially when I ride at night. But I also was thinking that maybe there's a more cleaner way to mount one on my remote. The Idea I have is putting a strong LED strip from the index finger slot and connect it down to where the wristlet is. This way you can also use your hands to alert other drivers from other directions if needed. Even then My hands are always down or on my butt going 35km+
