With the advertising on the post just below claiming their "torque vectoring" will stop speed wobbles, got me wondering is it even possible to get a wobble with a powered truck? I never have.

Yes of course it is possible to get speed wobbles on a powered truck.
Its possible on any truck. But wider and longer wheel bases reduce likelihood of speed wobbles.

Speed wobble requires the two wheels changing speed quickly and the esc and motor would prevent that from happening
Who has gotten speed wobble in the truck with at least one motor?

You say it wouldn't be possible on a single, I don't think that is true. Imagine a car, obviously you will never see a single wheel drive, but with 2 wheel drive, it depends on the differential, I know there isn't trucks so it kind of doesn't make sense. But if you have a 2 wheel drive esk8 and they would be considered locked differential, then you could not get speed wobbles theoretically on the back truck. The front truck could still get it. On a 4wd with locked differential it would be impossible to get speed wobbles. (I think....)

I don't know if it's possible just don't see how it could happen. Even with one motor on the truck having a wobble would require that powered wheel changing speed really quickly despite what the esc is feeding it. No?  
Who has had a wobble on a powered truck?
 
A car is so different in many ways I can't see similarities enough to compare. Never heard of a speed wobble with a car anyway.  No trucks.

By that do you mean a hub with at least one motor? Because I have a Carvon single hub and I've definitely gotten speed wobbles, but at like 30mph.

Either hub or pulley wheel.  Was it a wobble on the powered side..maybe it was the regular wheels?
Maybe dual diagonal motors don't wobble.

Its possible. Not due to different wheels speeds, but oscillation between the front and rear trucks. It always originates in the rear truck. want to kill speed wobble? put a 0 degree truck on the rear.

I'm still not convinced!  If there were a motor on both the front and back truck I think speed wobbles wouldn't be possible.

Not sure the motors or their placement have anything to do with central pivot oscilation.

```
A wobble requires the wheels quickly changing speed but if even just one on a truck were powered that would stabilize it no?  Keep it to a specific speed.  If a wobble involves interaction/ossilation between two trucks maybe only one motor would be good enough.  Someone argue with me because as it is now...maybe even one motor would be good enough.  Who has had wobbles?  Never me

I was trying to page you a couple days ago Dave when someone was asking: how'd you casting of pulleys go?

I'm not sure you central premise is correct.
My understanding is that it is the occultation of the central pivot on the design of skate trucks that are based on railroad car trucks, hence the name and they had problems with wobbles and very little change in wheel speed.

BUT... having said that, and this is purely anecdotal, I haven't noticed wobbles on my powered boards. I do have a lower angle and stiffer back trucks, both of which are supposed to help prevent wobbles.

So there may be some part of a powered system that accounts for less occurrences of speed wobbles.

Love to find out!

I haven't cast pulleys in awhile...I thought they worked pretty well, but I'm more fond of  steel and aluminum pulleys. The casting process is fun though.

Yes, it is possible. Don't know the science behind it but I, as well as many others, have experienced speed wobbles on the Evolve boards (not sure about the GT). Has a lot more to do with the gullwing style trucks though.

Maybe you got wobbles in the front which aren't powered?
From the more I look it up anything to dampen the oscillations will help...having wheels that only turn at a controlled speed, with a motor for example, should do it wonderfully

Maybe people are lifting off throttle when they start to sense speed wobbles which causes the powered wheel to act as a normal wheel?

Kind of how like when towing a boat. People instinctively slow when they see the trailer wandering behind them when what you are supposed to do is apply more throttle.

the motor just acts as a damping effect, so it could reduce the likelyhood of wobbles, but it wont eliminate it. wobbles is a complicated periodic shift of energy between truck bushing, board flex and rider. the more components that store energy (and release it with a deadly phase shift), the more likely youll end up with wobbles at certain frequencies. the whole thing can probably be reduced to some multiple mass spring system and a motor is some mild form of damping ... which is good but in the end just very mild.

theories. 
 Who's has dual diagonal and gotten wobbles?  I think the motor more than works as a damper but a complete limiter of movement

not very. what that guy shows in the video is simply some inertia thing - it goes left, the mass of the board is accelerated left and the centrifugal force is turning the board outwards (which is possible, because the trucks have no resistance at all). so now the board accelerates to the right, board flips outwards again and it repeats itself. 

speed wobble is actually a a resonance catastrophe of multiple energy shifts from wheel, truck bushings, board flex and most importantly rider legs with various spring coupling constants and phase shifts that, if triggered by the right frequency, will end up in a resonance catastrophe.

nope, if that would be true, you couldnt even carve anymore. I can carve very well and barely feel the motor.

just look at all the wide axle wobbly evolve at setups. people speed wobble crash with those all the time ...

but thats now with our current gear. you could probably tune ESCs to recognize the wobble moment and counteract it with well tuned counter torque - something like a cars ESP. ;)

But.. with a wobble the wheel speed has to change so much each second.  I don't think you could get a motor that's given a consistent current could vary its speed so drastically.

I had speed wooble once when my cousin and I sat on the board and went full speed. I also had a bit of wobble the other day when I was going downhill at full throttle, my trucks were quite loose though so that may have affected it.

As @whitepony mentioned I think ttere's def connection between us and the board ... over compensating or under compensating...center of gravity....how quick we are to adjust of the wobble...

But as you notice sitting, effectively lowing the center of gravity doesn't help be more stable...

Its a combo of all factors  tightness, looseness, bushings, angle, width, length and how we react (skill) 

But what is the percentage of each as a whole? What has more effect of the cause? Will 4wd counter the speed wobble effect?

I don't know

I definitely get speed wobble on throttle when going over speed bumps at a high speed but its really controllable. The only time wobble has been a issue was trying to stop to quickly while unbalanced from 35mph. This is on dual rear.

I have another theory...

I think speed wobbles only happen while going in a streightish line. 
I have never witnessed speed wobbles during a carve/turn, and after reading about the physics of it it seems impossible to happen during a turn.

Am I completely crazy here?

So has anyone had speed wobbles occur while turning?

Could slightly turning into a wobble stop it?

Yea eboostin maybe if you are going fast then release the throttle so then coasting this will allow a wobble.  Maybe reduce throttle instead of coasting.

yea, thats true for 2 reasons: a truck bushing under lean is compressed and somewhat stiffer in the "more lean" direction (more damping) while in neutral position it is as loose as it can be in both directions, so its more open to quick lean shifts. 2nd reason is: during carving the rider has pressure on one side of the board and isnt alternating energy returns into 2 directions. really the best thing you can do when going straight and encountering signs of wobble: start carving! :slight_smile:

Thanks for the great explanation.

This info should be disseminated to everyone with a skateboard, could save some injuries.
