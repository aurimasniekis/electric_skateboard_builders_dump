I don‚Äôt know how many of you guys have seen it but there a video posted a little less then an hour ago showed a car that hit Ernesto. He appears to be ok was laying on the ground talking to the police. He was luckily wearing a helmet. From the video the car that hit him appears to have just blown through a light as they had a green light and were in the bike lane. 

So let‚Äôs send some good vibes to @Kaly

I have the feeling it will barely keep him from riding for more than a day.

Eat yo vitamins @Kaly you'll bounce back in no time. 

Also can we get a fuck yeah for helmets?

Helmets people.  Helmets save lives.  

So freaking happy Ernesto wasn't hurt more seriously.  

@Kaly drinks are on me in Colorado.

From the video drinks could be on Ernesto :rofl: cause that driver should be mad an example of cause they had the ride of way. Far to many people are getting hurt because of idiots not paying attention. I am glad that Ernesto is smart and was wearing a helmet.

If getting hit by a car, and flipping on to asphalt is minor, I don't want to see a major accident üòÖ

Let's just be glad the injuries are relatively minor. Glad to see him still up; lots of people don't walk away from similar accidents.

Thanks everyone for you love. 

More than ever super glad for HELMETS  and for all my mountain boarders please no bindings on public roads, if I would have been using bindings  the story would‚Äôve  been totally different,  the board end up totally under the car that could have been my legs. 

Thanks guys

Wish you a speedy recovery!\
Once a guy run a stop sign and I could luckily jump off the board out of the way, he managed to run over my board twice. I hope the drivers insurance will take care of medical bills and damaged stuff.

 Never considered it before but i might think twice about riding bindings on roads after seeing this.

PS. so hyped to receive my kaly enclosures, keep up the great work :slight_smile:

You build top of the line parts bro and I appreciate your attention to detail. The Esk8 community needs you man so quit playing chicken with cars and trucks in the future.

Glad you're OK. Good point about not using bindings in traffic. Could have made this relatively minor accident a devastating tragedy.
