Hard to tell what's behind the concept, but this is interesting. As usual speed, range and charging time are questionnable, but the design is really nice.

You'd better have a good balance to stay on this tiny board, especially the Mini!

Good luck in riding in traffic without controller. :slight_smile: This board looks really nice but I dont know what were they thinking about not making a proper controller.

If you see how Casey N. wasn't even able to ride it properly in his vlog, they still have work to do.
But according to their kickstarter, the griptape will "learn" how your feet behave. But yes questionable if you lose your balance for some reason and can't brake or accelerate :smiley:
