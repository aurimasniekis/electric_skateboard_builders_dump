I think a 2 year old would have no problem riding one of these. 
Ok, maybe 3 years old might be better.

Certainly, by 5 years, I think they would be able to safely come along for a e-ride with mom and or dad on the trail.

When did your spawn start riding a skateboard properly? 

Mine was about 5 or 6 when he learened how to keep his momentum in a half pipe.

Idk how much these cost, but they look fun as hell, and seem like they could be a great, and much safer way to get your kids into the sport.
