Hi builders!

I’ve bought a while ago a Sanyo 10s2p from Meepo, and I’m planning to open it and make it a single layer (around 300mm long instead of 150mm)  then put on top the vesc so I can have a low profile enclosure. What you think? Is this possible without a spot welder? Does anyone have a good shrink wrap link on amazon? Thanks!!!

Depends how the pack is made. This is my Sanyo 27000 pack.![20180529_102630|666x500](upload://56FoLQOyRWYKoH2cWTHHrWCQmEW.jpg)
So I would suggest that you cut the shrinking tube to have a better look inside

@DAddYE
I would be interested to see some pictures afterwards if you bother to share them.

@DAddYE have you ever gotten the chance to split the pack? I’m thinking about doing it for my Sanyo pack as well.
