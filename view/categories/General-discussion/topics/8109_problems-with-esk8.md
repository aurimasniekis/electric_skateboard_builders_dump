Hey guys,

I was thinking and  i have read a lot of stories on hear of people having various problems with their builds and some have ended up in hospital.

I'd like to dedicate this post, where we can write down the problems we have had and find a solution to fix them. I have read many people ESC/VESC cut off when riding randomly. Maybe a fix for this problem could be a could start. Maybe a vesc bypass? so if the vesc fails the board won't cut off immediately?

Anyway report your problems here and lets try to get fixes for them.
