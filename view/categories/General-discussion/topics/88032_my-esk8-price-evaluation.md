No this is not my bid.

I am all for having fun but at some point you have to address the op's question.

Maybe you should include how often your batteries were charged and how many km you drove with it. But I also wouldn't pay over 500‚Ç¨. Maybe even 400‚Ç¨. :slight_smile:

The bid war was all in good fun I think. I was initially going to state a price that I thought was appropriate but there isnt really enough info. I was hoping by bidding eventually we would work our way up to what people we're actually willing to pay given the info here.

In terms of value it's probably a bit worse than those xiaomi scooters everywhere, so 400‚Ç¨ seems a good evaluation to me.

I drove 30km max on it (I don't really enjoy esk8, it was more about building stuff), I charge batteries once a month, from what I know it's good for batteries when they aren't used (same as for motorcycle batteries during a winter)
```

I might part out and send things to other countries, depends on shipping cost and of course if there will be buyer for a complete in Poland I will sell it locally (just because it will be more profitable for me)

If it's any consolation, my bid was not meant to be asshole like. Many people on this forum have been very helpful and I aim to be the same where I can. 

I was thinking a fair price would be between 5-600 USD but I am not an expert
