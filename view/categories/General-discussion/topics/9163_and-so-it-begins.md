OK, so I know these are, at the moment, just the components to make a regular longboard, but these just arrived today from Germany and all of the mechanics/electrics were dispatched from DIYes earlier today :)

Not sure which is better - looking at the excitement and potential of a new project or seeing the final result!  Have fun!

Flex 3 probably because that's what Boosted uses.

think the bearings are in the tube.... think the round thing may be grip tape cleaner, which i'm trying to track down!

The orange thing is just the tube that the truck bolts come in. A nice touch from SkateDeluxe is that they give you 8 black bolts and 2 extra gold bolts if you want to add a highlight somewhere - not sure if I'll use them though.

Flex 3 as you can't get Flex 1 or 2 in 38" (at least, not here - supplies are limited over here in the UK), as @Pantologist says, it's what Boosted uses and finally, according to Loaded it's the right flex for my weight (with or without the electrification components).

Assembled... Probably everyone's seen this configuration before.

Waiting for delivery of the good stuff now...

Not yet - Work and vacation have taken priority... This is a winter project for me. I do have all the mechanical and electronic gear loosely mounted and I've tested the motors and VESCs etc. I still need to get the CANBus and receiver working and also figure out how I want to house all the electronics & batteries etc.
