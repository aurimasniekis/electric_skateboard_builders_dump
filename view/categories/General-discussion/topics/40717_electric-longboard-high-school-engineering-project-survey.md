Hi, thanks for taking the time to view my post!

My name is Austin Lee, and I am currently enrolled in an engineering class in my high school. Me and my group are designing a longboard with an electric motor, brakes, and audio system. We are trying to solve the problem of various skating injuries due to the exhaustion of long rides, unsafe braking from high speeds, and mobility/awareness restrictions caused by headphones. At the current stage of our project, we are required to test the market with a survey to help develop, and choose, our groups best design or idea. It would be greatly appreciated if you could take the time to fill out the survey pasted below.

Thanks again!
Austin Lee

What do you actually have to do for you project? Do you have to build a longboard or just test the market?

Throughout the first semester we are conducting research on past products and testing the market. Then second semester we will work on building the board and presenting our solution.

Alright make sure to do lots of research

BTW this hobby is expensive af

This is an expensive project man I wouldn't recommend it unless you have deep pockets

Now you say you want to solve these problems however 2/3 have already been solved and no one would ride with a speaker on their board, first of all it disturbs the peace, second of all when you are riding the actual board it would be hard to hear. Now one could argue it's for when you are not riding but if that's the case why not get a speaker? Building a board is good but you aren't actually solving any of the problems you previously stated if at best you'd be taking solutions already on the market unless you plan to build the control board and everything else from scratch which again have already been solved. Not really sure what injuries are caused by the exhaustion of long rides? Anyways that's just some decent critique this would be a fun project in your personal time but for your school project it doesn't very well answer the prompt

I'm pretty sure @longhairedboy did a build with speakers on it.
i was going to, but he beat me to it like usual.
I still might use some transducers to make the deck itself into a "speaker".

but mostly I agree this is not needed, the vibration, music, hardware probably won't like eachother, but its pretty easy to add on so why not....

It's more of like a fun thing, I'm just saying that for their project it doesn't solve the problem, if it's disruption to the public and you can't hear it then how does it stop people from just wearing earbuds

But I say for fun go for it

I mean, those are not the problems of skating, let alone riding electric longboards. Some are caused by missing IQ points (headphones in traffic/public roads while riding...) and others by being inexperienced or new to the sport ( exaustion of long rides, unsafe braking from high speeds). The problem you have is that all of your mentioned "issues" are user based. What I mean is the rider is by far the biggest if not the only contributor in all of the above. 

What puts me off the most is reading high speed and Audio system on the same page. I mean have you ever doen anything "high speed" on a longboard ? (35mp/h+ / 56km/h which is concicered rather fast on here for others daily commute) You just wont hear shit. There are seriously impressive portable sound systems out there, for all sizes annd price points. There is absolutely no need to try to put those 2 things together. There is a reason my car has no oven, not because its hard to do its just why ?!. 

If you already intend to put alot of time into it I suggest those points:
- secondary braking system
- adjustable baseplate
- IPS 6 +
- integrated remote in to slide glove
etc...

But for them to do that they would need deep pockets which for a project like this makes no sense

Build the speakers into your back pack like @Titoxd10001 üëå

hey man i'm in highschool too and doing this as a hobby. let me tell you, unless you are ready and willing to drop north of $1000 on this you're not gonna get anything worth your money

as far as solving high speed braking, these electric boards are worse than normal ones.  The presence of a brake and motor makes riders way too confident in their ability to stop and many go much faster than they could handle on a normal board. Then, when the electronics fail, they're stuck going 30+mph with no idea how to safely stop and end up getting hurt.  adding complexity just makes things worse. You're much better off designing something like the brakeboard trucks that can be brought to market at a lower price - that's an innovation i'd love to see on more eboards out there.

I added speakers like 5 years ago lol. My phone is louder, it's time to upgrade.. soon üëç
