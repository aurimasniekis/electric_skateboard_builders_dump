We have over the winter our controller new designed.
So we build on the PCB a new 2Pin connector.
So you can now direct connecting the LCD battery monitor.
You must no no soldering and you can making the monitor
off over the antispark.
Here was the first Pictures for you.

We are now building the housings ourselves
and by that we can once again lower the price
From now on, the controllers cost only 159.- € for EU customers
In the dual cost the controllers 300.- € and there is a battery indicator
free of charge, as a gift.

we must finished the new controller with al cables and housing.
Then we must making al opinions for non EU customer with another price.

Do you mean the V 1.1 or the V 4.12
I do not compare our controller
with the FocBox or V6
The basis was the V4.12
For the original V 1.1 only the option came
that you can now plug in the LCD display
without soldering.

The 60K limit is still existing with focboxes AFAIK - anything above is highly inefficient and it still is a 4.12 at heart.
The DirectFETs might help and you have them here as well so it should be on par with the Focbox if not better (Remember: This is made in Germany while Focboxes are made in China and had some QC issues recently if i remember correctly).

First of all, we focused on the product
that we can produce it so well and cheaply
That the customer gets good quality at an affordable price
We are considering whether the customer decides
whether he is willing to pay a little more money for the product,
which is then passed on as a donation to BV.
We thought about giving a possibility to the customer
if he is ready for it.
The customer can decide for himself and a button
click where he decides if he wants to donate 1, 2 or 5 €
The current price is fair and I think nobody will
It's hard to pay more for a donation.
The amounts donated by the customers will be made public
The amounts of course, not the customers.

Everyone can freely donate on https://vesc-project.com/vesc_tool by selecting the preferred "status".
Otherwise the seller will just do it for you but raise the price by that amount.

How many percent of people do you really think hit the donate button plus many use ackmaniac for example, where bv automatically gets 0.
I know -  open source bla bla nobody has any obligations obviously but I really think this has got to do with common decency.
There's a bunch of Vesc-ish manufacturers who make a lot of cash based on his development (hard and software). This took so much skill and years of work. I don't think it's unnecessary to remind people who they got to thank for this every now and then.

Not sure I agree as I'd rather have the choice myself and not be forced into it by the seller - I also believe a conscious decision for donating makes you appreciate the work more and leaves you with a better feeling than otherwise.
Nevertheless the "option" during checkout looks like a fair way of dealing with the problem no?

That's really exaggerated. BV SHOULD get a cut and be compensated for his work - it's just about how that is made happen.

HF also did not offer the schematics for his cars for free on the internet for everyone to just produce and make money off of him.

yeah anything above in efficient theory... I dont care  as long as it doesn't fry. 
About german tho, they lost ww2 because of qc control and expense. ( no offense) point being expensive and perfect is not always the best case.
And why are u keep brining me Focbox. I didn't even mention it. Like I said talk to Jason.

and the donation is not mendatory. it is open source if you feel paying BV, go for it. But lots of invention and design available for free and some don't even ask for donation. You'd be dead without open source invention. Penicillin saved million because nobody ask for "appriciation money"

U like donation? go to patreon, go fund me but don't force it.

People no offense
We already sent the first donation to BV in December 2015.
For the 4.12
Only Enertion, chacka and we sold the Vesc.
Even Trampa bought Vesc from us and even from the money
What Trampa has paid us went to BV
But you also have to understand that at the moment we are just trying
to produce a good quality
So as not to spoil the product itself
at a price.
We will not get rich with it,
but there is another phylosophy behind it
I think everyone knows that we build good quality.
We can gladly raise the price and donate from it.
But we want people to volunteer.
You get a good price and the good quality.
Customers from non-EU countries
get a dual setup for 252.- €
If the price is not good then I do not know
Since the customer can also donate something right?
But only on a voluntary basis, nobody is forced to do that.

With that many FOC DRV problems the 4.12 hardware had I guess they want to stay safe and not give warranty in case that something goes wrong. Kind of understandable at the price point. Even the Focboxes require the additional warranty package AFAIK and they have FOC in their name. 
However I'd also like to hear if FOC stability was improved.

I ride al my Boards with FOC with the 4.12 and with the esk8 controller.
Without problems, and i never grilled the DRV.
The problem was only by the customers, they can´t finde a good manuals.
We want making a tutorials video for FOC and with english subtitle.
But by the Video must help me a friend, because my english was
katastrophal.
We sending the controller with FW 2.18.
The big problematic was by FW 2.18, that you don´t should between
FOC and BLDC.
When your controller run under BLDC and you want change to FOC,
than it was better programming the controller new with the FW 2.18
and after then don´t using the BLDC but also the FOC.
And what very very important, thats you don't going over 10S and 200KV.
Next week i became new motors with 12S and 170KV, and then i testing
the controller with 12S and FOC.
Some customers tel me that he have tried out with the controller 1.1
12S and FOC at own risk with the SK3 Motors with 162KV and it was working.
But before i can say that´s working, i must testing by myself.

Yes I had the 4.12 running in FOC with 136kv motors and 10s for some weeks without problems.
The 1.1 controller I'll use with 130kv motors and 10s.
But I have no experience with 12s with this controllers. In general, the lower the kv the safer is the use of FOC. The new FW with Vesc-Tool is also safer for FOC than the old (2.18), there are some improvements.

Rich says just right
the lower the KV the smaller the risk in FOC
It is not clear to me why all unconditioned 12S want to drive?
Rich says just right
the lower the KV the smaller the risk in FOC
It is not clear to me why all unconditioned 12S want to drive?
In 10S I can drive 200KV and do not go to the limit
In 12S I have to go down with the KV.
If I drive 10S and 200KV then the engine turns at 8400 RPM / 58.800ERPM
But at 12S I have to down to 170KV so 8568 RPM / 59,976 ERPM
So I can not imagine that this 168RPM from the engine
make up so much more.
Ok, if I do it because of the performance, yes, I win per engine
500W more power
But this should fit the perfomance to run no risk
What I'm most interested in is how much further I can go with 12S
With the same Ah in the battery.
Is that really worth it?
At the moment I drive with 10S and 18.72Ah 28-30 Km with my Flame Board.
Once I get everything together, I'll try it out
how many more miles I will be able to drive

```
just out of curiosity i did some calculations. More voltage means better efficiency, there is a point of adding voltage because the overall power of the battery pack is increasing aka Watthour (Wh).

Lets do some simple maths:

We are driving with a board with 1 motor at a specified speed and a specified rider weight. We are pulling 30 amps continuously from the battery. I will calculate with maximum charge voltage here and maximum capatizity (30Q = 3 Ah)

This means:

10S5P: 42V * 30A = 1260 Watt drawn continuously from the battery

lets get this same wattage from a 12S4P battery

1260 Watt / 50.4V = 25A

oh well, we increased efficiency by about 17-18% by adding 2 more cells in series.

Lets see what happens with our capaticity when were using the total amount of power 17% more efficient.

10S5P = 15'000 mAh
12S4P = 12'000 mAh

we're using the 12'000 mAh more efficient right now: 12'000 mAh * 1,17 = 14'040 mAh.

this means were missing 1000 mAh usable capaticity, but we have 2 cells less than 10S5P and more output power overall.
```

```
Thats unfortunately not how electricity works.

In your example:

10s5p: 15.000 mAh: 540 Wh
12s4p: 12.000 mAh: 518,4 Wh

The Wattage drawn is what matters, so if you´re drawing 1260 W, that means:

**10s5p:** 
540 Wh / 1260 W = 0,429 h = 25,71 min. till empty

**12s4p:**
518,4 Wh / 1260 W = 0,411 h = 24,69 min. till empty

So if you only take the battery as benchmark, you can simply take the Watthours to messure which one holds more energy and can deliver the same amount of drawn power longer.

For efficiency you have to consider much more things and look at the whole drive system.

yeah you're right, but still a system powered by higher voltage is definitely more efficient, because most people think that only capaticity matters.

thats why the range between 10S5P and 12S4P is not really that different, but people will still think i maybe losing much range because of the missing 3 Ah

Thats again depends on the system. 
The key to efficiency is to minimize losses. There are motors running better on 8s than on 12s.
Sometimes it´s more beneficial to run higher Amps than Volts.. there is no optimal way to generalise it all!

we could not get more amps on the LCD plug
like on all other current pins.
Overall, you can load everything with 1A
LCD receiver and all other modules

Hmm, assuming avg 40V, you get 40watts, isnt too bad, could run 12v1-2A off it

more amps mostly mean more heat and loss in the cables because of resitsance

Welp I just ordered some of these planning to run em 12s hopefully with FOC we shall see tho.... 60$ cheaper than focbox's shipped to me and even has some extra  features. Hopefully she performs.

i am going 12S but without FOC, if you want/can please provide some information how it worked
