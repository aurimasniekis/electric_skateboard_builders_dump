So theoretically people can still buy them for the discounted price now and receive them in 2 weeks time? Have you got enough stock? 

Should promote these bad boys hard now!

How many mm extra space would you need to use this pulley? 
How many mm does the bearing pulley design "take".
Thanks! :)

It's designed to work for trucks with 47mm bare axel like the Caliber-E truck or the torqueboardtruck, I think a normal truck has about 35mm axle length so the bearing pulley "takes" about 12mm :slight_smile:

kind regards
Frederic
