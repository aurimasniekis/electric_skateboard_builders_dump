Hi, I want to start mountain boarding and have a few questions. I want to buy a mountain board, not an electric one just a normal one, and then after learning to ride it for a while add my own electric components to suit my needs. Can I do that and if so what is a relatively easy board to do it to? I was also wondering if having suspension trucks make it harder to add motor mounts or to ride in general. I read the guide on esk8 that's pinned on the front page of this site, it was very helpful but I was wondering if there was one more specific to mtb. I would also like to see a tutorial on building a mountain board if there are any. I know that this is a lot to ask but if anyone could answer any of the above questions it would be very much appreciated. I look forward to spending more time on this forum.

Totally you can!

Tune the trucks right and you won't have problems with turning radius and stability at speed, it depends on the rider though. Mountainboard parts can be a little pricey.

@BigBrit is making a series detailing his process with building a MTB, 1st episode is out. Check out some of the MTB builds here on the forum too for inspiration and guidance.

Absolutely. Clearly. But! Make sure you get trucks that are amenable (arzamenable ftw!) to attaching motor mounts. Boards donâ€™t matter much. 

Im a big fan of MBS trucks.

I have seen some MBS trucks and they seem very high quality

Hey @cooc1501 ! Appreciate your thoughts on getting first used to the mtb before adding some external power on it! Definitely not the wrong way to start. You can find a lot of inspiration about mtb builds in here. 

One of the most informative threads about mtbs is probably the one from @rich
https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/dirt-machine-trampa-holypro-16-ply-vertigo-trucks-superstar-hubs-unik-polaris-6374-150kv-e-toxx-black-direct-drive-vesc-6-12s/45377?u=andy87

You can find a lot of useful information and comparisons on that thread, as well as mistakes which happened or parts that failed and how to avoid that.

Either MBS as well as Trampa boards are a good base to build up on.
