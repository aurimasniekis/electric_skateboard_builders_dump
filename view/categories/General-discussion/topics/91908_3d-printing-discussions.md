I tried looking up for a topic to discuss 3D printing related stuff but didn't find any. Hopefully this thread will be used to discuss cool techniques, equipment, upgrades, materials, speciality filament deals. For general printer related issues we already have reddit and facebook pages, so I hope this will be less of that. 

Ok, let me start. So printed TPU for the first time, just amazed how tough it is. Even surprised that a metal insert can adhere to it so well. So I am thinking of printing enclosure from TPU rather than from abs or petg which just cracks eventually.

Damn my hopes of a petg enclosure just went out the window

Well depends on the flex and the impacts from rocks. You can make a petg enclosure and then skin it with epoxy with Fiberglass/carbon fiber/fabric. That should do it.

Isn't TPU some kind of flexible filament ?
 
Can you show us how flexible it is ? 

Might be a good solution for impact resistant parts if it does not just wobble around :slight_smile:

I have not done any printing with TPU but as far as I know it comes in various shore ratings.

The one that I have is hardly stretchable(by hand) but bendable when printed into 2mm thick sheet.

I have sainsmart TPU from Amazon. Shore hardness of 95A

The best hidden feature I've found is the ironing feature. It leaves your top layer buttery smooth.

I’m part way through printing a tpu enclosure, I have used some carbon panels to save on printing. I’ve been using it for years for making canopies for drones, The stuff is amazing.![image|690x375](upload://gxQYmCtLeC4NFqBrL6k49bkiHGR.jpeg) ![image|375x500](upload://8d7aWZ0K4eUD3I1gmh8OtTChzKs.jpeg) ![image|666x500](upload://3apf7SEXDUITImh9fSSQbFwADlf.jpeg) ![image|375x500](upload://8xXVN5OsVfM4lpLO7uP0ifOucbU.jpeg)

Yeah TPU is very very cool, but a real pain in the ass to print
What do you all have in 3d printer and upgrades ?
I got a alphawise U30 (like the u20 but a bit smaller), it's good but it hasn't got any upgrade yet

The first thing you need is a direct drive extruder.

I print mostly tpu and have it dialled in on my wanhao i3 plus. I’m printing that in 0.3 to save time

That's good to hear that using tpu for enclosure is a thing. It seems nonporous too. BTW, how did you join the different tpu sections?

And yes, it's magical. The layer adhesion is incredible. It's so tough. I could lift my entire board from one insert heated and pressed into the standoff made from TPU. I don't think even abs or PETG can do that.

I upgraded my ender3 with $50(1.2+2.2+3.1) worth of parts to make it direct drive. I had posted the details somewhere else on the forum. Make sure to select 24Volts parts. Let me know if you need any more details. 

If anyone else is interested, you need just 3 things for making a direct drive all metal upgrade. 
1. Extruder  
[option1(original) $80](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/Double-Gear-3D-Printer-Extruders-Bondtech-BMG-Deceleration-Extruder/32999972236.html)

[option3(cloned)$16](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/Double-Gear-3D-Printer-Extruders-Bondtech-BMG-Deceleration-Extruder/32999972236.html)
2. All metal hotend  
[option1(original) $55](https://e3d-online.com/v6-all-metal-hotend)  
[option2(cloned)$16](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/Trianglelab-Highall-metal-v6-hotend-12V-24V-remote-Bowen-print-J-head-Hotend-and-cooling-fan/32844028127.html)

3. pancake stepper motor  
[option1 $8](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/Titan-Extruder-Stepper-Motor-4-lead-Nema-17-22mm-42-Motor-for-3D-Printer-A20-dropshipping/32866098993.html)

I also found that they have a combined cloned package for $37 [here](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/BMG-Extruder-Bowden-v6-Hotend-Dual-Drive-Extruder-With-PT100-Sensor-Harden-Nozzle-For-Wanhao-D9/32972082107.html):


I combined them all in a compact bracket, that I designed, which keeps the nozzle almost at the old position. I also put holes to mount the ABL sensor.

Because I have such a small bed I’m printing in 8 sections. They are bolted together then I will glue them into 2 main sections.

Each section overlaps.

I have heard all good things about cheetah but it's pretty expensive at $30 for 0.5kg from amazon(Maybe there are better deals). I am using [Sainsmart TPU](https://www.amazon.com/SainSmart-Flexible-Printing-Filament-Dimensional/dp/B00TI3JUUQ) and it's awesome at $27/kg. It appears from the youtube reviews that sainsmart tpu is less flexible than cheetah.

Thanks for the idea, is it abrasive resistant ? PETG and nylon are kinda self lubricated (not as much as POM or Teflon but still a bit) so it doesn't shred easily.

Seeing you've already done pressfitting with this, I'm tempted to try it now.

It seems really tough and abrasive resistant from messing around. No scientific testing though.

It's set in tpu using heat.

Hey I dug a bit more and it seems another alternative to SainSmart TPU is [**AmazonBasics TPU**](https://www.amazon.fr/dp/B07H9MML24/ref=sspa_dk_detail_1?pd_rd_i=B07H9X4K3K&amp;pd_rd_w=lmVeD&amp;pf_rd_p=f5a1a5f7-a125-4f98-b37a-2fcd828aef65&amp;pd_rd_wg=RaOMT&amp;pf_rd_r=79Y0FV1MM1YGZT6Y3BTK&amp;pd_rd_r=27bf1f11-6bff-11e9-ba4e-017bb8e0c721&amp;th=1) 

29.99€/kg and free shipping with Amazon Prime. 

Another question : Have you guys tried [**NinjaTek Armadillo TPU**](https://www.3dprima.com/filaments/ninjatek-armadillo-1-75mm-1-kg-snow-white/a-22926/) ? 75D shore super hard & rigid PU, super resistant to abrasion & wear. 

Looks dope but very expensive at 75€/kg. Might be the strongest printable available for consumer grade printers. 

I'd like to try both.

Anybody in EU interested in groupbuying rolls & the recipient of the rolls prints stuff for the group ? (Calling out EU because it's cheaper to ship printed parts afterwards)

@mishrasubhransu If you got time, since you already have experience you might be a good recipient ? I got a good printer with metal heated bed and E3D hotend with direct feed, so can do stuff too but I'm more familiar with PETG kind of filament.

Thanks for the suggestion, but I don't think I have a lot of spare time these days.

BTW, TPU is very easy to print with direct drive, just order some and try it. It will work.

@mishrasubhransu @niak what are your strategies for waterproofing your enclosures? Has anyone tried making the top solid, and a lid on the bottom side of the enclosure, so the seal is not in the normal path of water flow?

hey Iazarus, 

its not going to be waterproof, although i plan on gluing the seams with something.

i have run out of black and waiting for re-supply. hopefully it comes tomorrow and i can continue the mammoth print job

I've been using SaintSmart TPU as well, since it's one of the least flexible TPUs it's supposed to be easy to print. On my CR10S Pro I had mixed results, usually have to print at 20mm/s, above that the filament will get stuck at the extruder.

I'd be worried about making an enclosure out of TPU. Since it's flexible, during an impact it wouldn't provide much protection to the cells and the electronics. Not only things could go up in flames but higher changes of something moving around inside.
