Looks cool... all terrain hub motors? Time to see if they’ll sell those individually

I knew that looked like Florida. Too bad it's too far for me to go check them out. Maybe @longhairedboy can, the website says they are located in saint Augustine.

Yes, me too, at first seen the vegetation I thought that was Florida or perhaps Queensland, Australia. I turn out to be Florida.

How’s the maintaince? From what I heard in Vegas, with the Baja board, you spend more time adjusting and tuning. It than you spend riding it. Seems like the more complex you make it, the more maintaince I would expect.

I see so much potential. Most of it is pointlessly wasted in weight.

I like seeing an evolution of this concept.  Hub motors = heavy unsprung weight.  Absolutely a big disadvantage when offroading..  Would like a closer look to their suspension/steering as bumpsteer is really tough to engineer out and very crucial to stability. The Baja can barely be ridden flat and smooth at 20mph, Would like to see how these guys made 30 with 6" of travel.  Video looks like a good time but would like to see it in a race at a bmx track heads up againsed conventional AT wisdom.🏁. If this thing will really do 30mph on a 35%grade you guys should bring it to the Barrett Junction Esk8 uphill race in January. Would be glad to have you and see this in action..

Hmm "builds the most capable off-road, all-terrain electric skateboards in the world" cough bullshit Bajaboard would whip it ass big time lol

I think they will @MoeStooge ....if they were members of this forum! :laughing:  It was my idea to bring attention to this company, but 'am not related to them and I don't know who they are. Sorry guys.

The panel of peers in this forum are the world's Esk8 judge, jury, and executioners.  There is no other place like here with all of you.  Sorting out the good and the bad is just a part of progress.

Great comments from all, you guys know your stuff!  As for the "Judge, Jury, and Executioner" comment, I hope that grinding sound I  hear is not the axe sharpening..lol.

WRT Evoheyax comment, I totally agree.The board was designed with simplicity in mind. The only adjustment you have is Preload (sag) for the suspension, and tire pressure.  There are two marine switches, FWD and RWD, both on for 4WD.  No battery gauge, or beepers to tell you when you battery is dead.

Moe's comment on Sprung and Un-sprung weight is also a great one.  But you also have to look at the ratio of spung (Hub, spindle and tire) to unsprung (Rider and board).  In a off-road environment, the rear wheels get pelted by roost constantly from the front wheels. Belts, and cv's are not as reliable as a waterproof simple hub.

There are two models the SX is 68 lbs and is shorter and more agile.  See photo.![2018_Mainville_0144|690x460](upload://47tbZKKhRrtB6lT6ZcAbzPjJMMG.jpeg)

Single motor, front and rear differential with driveshafts would minimize unsprung weight and overall weight while reducing equipment.

Isn't that what Baja did with CV joints attached to the wheel with a pulley?

Moe is correct, single motor and differentials would reduce the unsprung weight.  To date I do not believe anybody has made a diff small-light-strong enough for a esk8 yet. However adding the diff, drive gears, cv's, boots, bearings may even increase OAL wieght, and would sacrifice the independent drive control of each wheel. Another consideration is the limited articulation angle of cv's, that limits suspension travel.

Honestly, the boards rides like a Cadillac, and sucks up bumps small and large making the sprung/unsprung weight consideration minor overall. 

Love the drawing!

Look into Baja board design they use CV axles on a pulley system

Looks like they also have 4 motors and no differential.

Yes they have 4 motors but the motors are sprung weight in their design
