Would choose any type of vesc over any ESC, its just far superior.
Theres a flipsky dual vesc variant GB going on check it out, only 120e for Europe if i remember correctly

I haven't looked into this flipsky dual yet. But I know theres an internal canbus connection, so you don't need a Canbus cable. 

But you will need a PPM splitter

But as for other things, its just the same as using two controllers
