Fun ride, me an Ian Ran into @Titoxd10001 and four or five boosted boarders. So a down and back and the boosted guys had to ditch. I don't know something about limited range something something. One more down & back. Swapped boards with Tito . Tito's board  is a nice ride with good power, a board you could Cruise all day. Must b those green wheels. Thanks for letting me Cruise your ride. Cops were cool and people and bikes everywhere.  Next ride. July 1st Venice Wailer To Santa Monica.

Cool running into you again @moestooge . Was a fun ride. Glad we didn't run into any napkins. Thanks for the sandwich and I'll try to make it to the next ride if I can wake up for the early ride.
