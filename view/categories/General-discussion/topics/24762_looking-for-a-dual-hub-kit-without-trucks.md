Hi,

I am looking to convert my longboard, Bustin Strike, to electric.  I want to do it with dual hub motors but I want to use my existing trucks.  Does anyone know of a kit that has the hub motors, controller, battery, charger, and remote?  I know that Landwheel and Mellow have something like this but include the trucks. I would also be interested in creating the kit myself but I am new to building my own.  Any help would be appreciated.  I recently bought a used Evolve Bamboo Gen 2 and love it.

Thanks in advance,
Mark
