Hi guys, 

I saw ok Instagram, pics of a Exway X1 Pro! Is this the version 2?

Am I allowed to post pics from it here?

Actually I do like the small wheels. 90mm is the max for me. Skateboard should ride low on street. With Esk8 we moved to the bigger the better but the riding stability sucks compare to low ride. Only exception is if you have a drop down/through board where you can still be low with 100mm wheels. Just my opinion. We need big wheels because with belt drive and big motor you need clearance

Big wheels help with pebbles and cracks. I personally dont like getting stuck in train tracks. My kegels would get stuck crossing trolley tracks.

Absolutely true but 85mm is plenty for those. If you really bad roads then an AT set up is the way. Even bigger PU sucks on cracks. You can pass them but you don't feel it nice and you loose stability too.

85mm so I cant say it wouldn‚Äôt work but I dont want to risk flying forward off my board..I can slow down and control an unstable board.

I also do ride 90mm since I find it a good compromise in the city. Just saying that I have tried normal board upgraded to 100mm wheels and they feel way more unstable. Same reason why downhill guys use small wheels and racing car are the closest as possible to the ground.

Totally understand but then I would go for pneumatic. I only ride fast on street that I to everyday and I know very well. Even I 106l7 wheels if I found a big un aspect hole I lose stability. As I said 107mm wheels yes of I would have a drop down deck that allows me to stay close to the ground. I now switch back to 90mm that it still rather big, but 97mm on my small commuter where just not right. I felt like riding on eggs. I hope the clearance with my direct drive is enough. We'll see it.

Ps: Never found this metal plate here.

@b264 I retract what I said, I was home in Spain and I saw 5! of these plates. They laid them down with a 45deg angle, super scary passing over them at 40-50kmh with my road bike.

They should make 5hek with a kind of rubber surface to do not compromise the grip. I unders5and they do not think about Esk8, but I am sure bike will also have problem with it.

They are super rare around here in germany, you can however see them sometimes on the sidewalks as a semipermanent solution. They did it near my workplace when they reconstruct the street from 2 to 6 lanes (right next to a DSLAM). Maybe these plates are illegal on the actual street in germany. Around here the typical reaction is to close off the lane and maybe place a construction traffic light. But also often they simply close the street till they can temporary bury it.

The paths in my area can be even worse than that.
However I have found a solution that works without any purchasing - it only requires skill.

Loosen your trucks, you want to make your trucks as loose as possible so that if you're not moving and you try to turn as hard as you can and lean back a little one of your front tires will lift.
Using this you want to try and to a sharp turn maneuver right as your hitting the raised part so that the wheel is already raised up. Since your trucks are so loose and you're taking the hit at an angle your trucks will then act as suspension. You then obviously need to rapidly turn back to stay in a straight line.

Drawbacks. If you don't have good balance your gonna fall off. If you're not good at handling speed wobbles your gonna fall off. But once you have gotten used to your board you can try this method.
My exway is the only longboard I have ever used and I was able to use this method after only reaching 300km (now up to over 500) (also I did gymnastics as a kid so I have a greater than average balance)

I can make my front wheels lift way easier than that.  The issue is a lot of times I'm carrying my laptop and my dog or maybe a bunch of groceries and it's unexpected when you'll suddenly find one.  I've found that the best method is to hit them at 45 degrees ... with 107mm or bigger wheels....

Carrying a dog while riding... What a mad man.
I definitely know what your talking about.
I am 50kg, and one of my bigger shops my bad weighed 12kg and I was very scare of those sort of bumps.
Also I do have street plates, but normally they slap some tar around it to smooth the edges - my problems is the fact that the slates of the footpath aren't aligned and sometimes there is a literal 6cm difference

Exactly what happened to me. I fell, dislocated my pinky and now it doesn't open all the way. It was actually way worse, so I made a 3D printed brace to straighten it out gradually and it has slowly been getting better.

The feeling of stability comes from the distance of your center of force(applied by your feet) relative to the pivot point in trucks. The higher it is  the more actively you have to control it to stay vertical. The lower it is, the more passively stable it is.

On the topic of wheels, if you have good roads then go thane any size you‚Äôd like. If you are in NYC like me, doesn‚Äôt want pneumis, go 90mm and above. I had 90mm on my Boosted and that should be the standard for any thane board to come with. But now after having pneumis, I‚Äôll stick to thane when kick pushing.

Yes riot is faster and feels better cause of full thane, but as of right now it's still a prototype with printed pulleys and way too tight belt tension so it's not fair to compare range. @neiru37 and I are drag racing them both against the V2 dual+ to compare top speed as well

I'm still a noob thank for clarifying..but when you go to maytec site and they say the 170kv  5065 is only good for 10s ..or other site selling there motors usually specify the voltage rating ..only one I've found is the racestar  and Hoyt saying there 50** is 12 s capable.

What kills motors is too much current making them overheat, the insulation on the windings is probably good  up to a couple hundred of volts

Of course, you put the motor to run at 30S it may explode because the forces will be to great, but 12S no problem

Exway is coming STRONG after those Boosted sales.  Good for Exway!  Finally, we might hear another esk8 company taking a legitimate shot at those Boosted sales numbers. In all honesty, if I was lighter and getting out of the DIY game, I would be down for the Riot Pro.  I hope with the introduction of Ewway, all companies start to step up their game.  Also, I hope we start to get some of these cool technology implementations in the DIY community.

Next thing you know Exway is going to have an AT board!

Exway drag race and a few things found to be less than ideal with the prototype Riot setup he has.

Has Exway given any indication on what the riot setup will even cost ?
Like it's being talked up a lot but what if it turns out to be a $700 add on ? how many people will jump on that ? Seems kind of shifty to build up the hype for the X1 Pro based on Riot when no indication on price is given and the protoype that Daniel Kwan has seems to have a few issues still to be overcome.

That's called marketing. It allows speculation to grow in communities which in turn increases awareness. It's the equivalent of a shop having a coming soon poster on it's window. This was also probably unintentional since according to press reset, the news about the pro was not suppose to be released until a bit later.

All the more reason they shouldn't give a price until they have all of the final components down.

It's not going to be 700... That's ridiculous lol

Anyways here's the mounting method. One machined keyway on the truck, two keyways on the inside edge of the mount. You can flip it front mount or rear mount. Then the mount is compressed with a big screw.
