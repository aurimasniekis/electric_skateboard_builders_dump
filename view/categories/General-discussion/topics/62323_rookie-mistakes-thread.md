I finished my first complete build and am still fixing mistakes I made here and there even with all the careful reading I did. I figure it may be a good idea for us to post some of the mistakes we made the first time to help others avoid the same fate. 


Always remember to tighten your grub screws, even if its not the one your using. They will damage your belt if they stick out. I left one sticking a bit out in my late night building and it damaged my belt.

DO NOT hold the accelerator on the remote before you turn it on. This can cause it to accelerate like mad on its own lol. At least with foc bix and nanox split ppm

Try to ride with some light tools and take it slow because your first build isnt always the safest. Shit can and will go wrong so please pad up and wear a helmet. My mistake was no pads, I had helmet on when i ate shit running Bldc... Foc for life lol

This should be stressed, i cant tell y'all how many times I was saved because I always ride with every tool needed to disassemble my whole board... keep all the allen head BITS (not Allen keys) you need for the board and every socket needed for the board it's really not a lot, I keep 2 ratchets, spare Allen keys (just in case) and a set of all the Allen keys needed. Oh and always keep spare belts, and if you have them a spare pulley

 I could honestly go on and on with the many mistakes that I made LOL. One I forgot to mention that I made was over tightening my enclosure.... it actually ended up adding extra stress to a weak part of my board and caused the carbon fiber board to snap!!!

I really gotta buy some hex plus Allen head bits. The sets are just too much $$ atm. I should just buy the individual sizes that I need.
What are the typical Allen head sizes needed?

Yes use some threaded inserts and blue loctite, let it cure and u really won't need to torque them down

@Skunk that really does depend on you... if you go to fastenal or ur local ace you can usually get all matching hex heads

Best advice for noobs -- is to picture (in your head) yourself taking your newly-built board, picking it up, and bashing it wheels-first as hard as you can into a concrete wall for about 30 minutes.  Think about what this will do to the insides.  Construct the insides to be okay with this.  Because this is, in fact, exactly the same forces the insides feel while riding it over bumps and cracks with your full weight on top.

I use them like other people use a car.  I was carrying 50 lbs of groceries across town the other day and
![20180718_000306|690x345](upload://LZ5zl5L7MFTTbwmsvANc7EfAHl.jpg)

this happened.  I actually rode it out without falling :smiley:

I can't stress enough how **reliability** is more important than looks, than range, than top speed, than torque, than just about everything else.  This is something I don't think noobs understand much.  This nice shiny machine you made WILL break.  How it breaks and how long it takes before it does and how easy it is to fix or upgrade are things noobs don't typically consider...

Wow. Just happened to run into this post....

BigBoyToys
May '171 
Maybe our electrical engineers on the forum have learned their lessons elsewhere, but all my bulds have been taken apart multiple times. We should start a mistakes thread/look what I broke thread, if there isnt already one lol.

Things Ive screwed up:

More VESC‚Äôs than I care to admit.
Jacobs hub motors. LOst side plate bolts, shifted the press fit axle sleeve at the center of the stator rippong off the phase leads, shorted the stator winding trying to use it as a 1WD, slipped the urathane wheels(not my fault).
Bent axles on the carvon truck hanger.
Damaged the threads in the rotor of a Torqueboards hub motor when the screws loosened while riding.
Almost died learning over powered dual diagonal drive on a super short board is a bad idea.
Saw white spots for hours after I shorted a battery lead to ground while trying to repair a solder joint on my anti spark switch.
Ran PPM wires too close to phase wires and got intermittant cutouts
Chewed up a belt or two braking from high speed without enough belt tension.
Didnt use grommets on an enclousure and wore through the phase wires.
Broke corners off an enclousure when a couple of fasteners vibrated loose during a long ride.
Blew up a speed controller going down a long hill with a fully charged battery on the Onan X2.
Had both wheels come flying off of 190kv hub motors on 12S voltage when a newb hit the accelerator while holding the board.
Almost died when my boosted board cutout due to full charge going down hill.
Fried multiple CAN transceivers on my VESC‚Äôs trying to get a 4WD CAN BUS set up going.
Had a board stolen cjz I left it i the car overnight chistmas eve(theives favorite night).
Things Ive learned the hard way:

A little glue on connectors goes a long way.
Velcro isnt as useful as I thought it would be.
I put shrink tube over bullet connectors to keep them together
I take new parts apart to put loctite all over them.
I use batteries with more current rating and capacity than I think you‚Äôll need.
VESC‚Äôs blow up if I skipped any of these steps.
Found out putting your receiver behind your back for a high speed tuck is a bad idea.
The CAN BUS terminal resistor needs to be changed to connect more than two VESC‚Äôs via CAN BUS.
How to use a reflow station.
How to brush all mistakes Ive made under the rug to make myself feel better about blowing serious $ on this hobby.
Nothing in this industry was designed for super heavy people :(.
Wear a helmet
Dont leave $2k skateboards in your car.

RIP..

Ugh... this is just making me more paranoid about starting my build. But it's only so fun looking at a pile of expensive parts. Think I have everything but battery and remote.

Trying to buy good parts and I'm not hooking anything up without looking it up twice and then asking again lol. This hobby is soooo out of my price range. Been working crazy extra to make this happen.

Don't be afraid. If you do a little bit of research before you will be fine. I did my first build, have made a ton of modifications, changed a million settings... i've never had anything go seriously wrong.

Worst thing i've had up to this point is a couple ABS over current faults that didn't cause any issues and went away on it's own.

So what have I done so far.......over amped the battery max and blew a bms...........disconnected the canbus and fried two focboxes...........had phase wires wrong on dual hubs, spinning in different directions,(in my defense I didn't have my glasses on)  didn't realise, shot off downhill and cooked one motor and vesc........snapped the nose off a drop through cheap deck (that really hurt)...........more will probably come to mind but I will say it was all done in the spirit of learning and adventure.  
Research research research   Learn from everyone else's mistakes but trust me you will make your own special cock ups that we will be only too willing to laugh about!  crack on chaps there's nothing better to do with your time!

Haven't finished my first build yet but I have made a mistake (probably more). When I began ordering parts, the first parts I ordered was from shops with fast delivery (eskating.eu, buildkitboards.com, diyelectricskateboard etc.) instead of ordering from China. This now means that I'm waiting for China parts to finish my board. Please order parts from china before ordering ANYTHING ELSE! It makes you save a lot of time and money.

edit: The weather in Denmark is usually shit but now it's perfect! 25¬∞ Celsius (77¬∞ Fahrenheit), no rain, no skies and the sun is shining the whole day!

Not even a rookie mistake from time to time is forgetting to put the heat shrink on before you solder. 

I can vouch for having the ppm wires to close to the phase wires. Having them next to the battery wires does not help either. 

With the nano x remote, if the battery dies of the remote while riding the board, it will go into a full stop. Found out the hard way. 

Don‚Äôt ride in the wet and not dry your bearings after. They will rust. 

Make sure you securely connect the phase wires. If they loosen while riding and you let go of the throttle the motor will brake even just from one loose phase wire. 

Securely connect the ppm wire to the receiver. When they slowly vibrate loose you will get interference like behavior. 

Never ride without a helmet. I did not find that out the hard way hence me being able to give this advice.

Rookie mistakes you say? I have a few good ones. 

First, the same week I got my new enclosure and deck I rode off a curb and 3/6 bolts tore through my shiny new enclosure and left half my electronics behind. It has since been duct taped to the board until I buy a new one and use washers this time lol. 

I also drilled through my deck to mount the enclosure. The screw pattern is a bit odd though so  either have to use this type of enclosure forever or make a new one with the same screw layout. Plan for the future!

Guys I know I'm repeating myself but I _can not stress this enough._
My rookie mistake :
Rolling down a hill it is easy to exceed the speed that your board is designed to run on its own. It can then easily happen that your vesc is unable to measure the motor rotation. This will turn your brake lever into a death trap! When slightly touching the brakes, the motor wires are shorted which will pull the board out from under your feet with max brakes.
Possible solutions until now: always go downhill slowly or hold full throttle the whole time. This will limit your speed to your boards max speed.
Sadly the vesc firmware developers don't seem too phased about this issue so it is important that this gets to be common knowledge so this doesn't cause any more harm.

When I was first doing my build @b264 suggested hooking up a micro usb to the Focbox and extending outside enclosure for tuning purpose it only took me having to unbolt enclosure maybe 10 or 15 times before I remembered the wisdom in his suggestion.  I now have a USB added to configuration and ported outside enclosure and am using a 16'' Tripp-lite USB 2.0 Extension cable I had laying around which makes tuning a breeze.

If you waterproof it, the extended USB can be an issue -- but especially for a first build, it's almost a requirement.  Another alternative, though not as good, is to get a bluetooth setup working first on the bench, before mounting it on the board.

Agree hooking up a bluetooth module for handling config either through the bluetooth connection or through the TCP bridge option makes it trivial to connect to your board without opening anything up and reconfigure things (with the metr app can also setup 'modes' with different amp limits on motor/battery and swipe the rows with them defined to apply them which is handy for giving the board over to someone who has never ridden an electric before without having it blast out from under them)

I had no idea that on nano-x 'slow mode' also made your brakes weak along with your acceleration and top speed. Coming down twin peaks, my heart fucking stopped when the brakes could not stop me for a long time. Thankfully I was able to ride that out but I thought I was going to fucking die or something. If you have nano-x always be in R-Spec mode. ALWAYS!! 
Maybe I should make a PSA post for this

My biggest mistake was cheaping out on my first board. I spent well over $200 in esc (for a mono drive) before I finally decided to switch to Vesc. I also had a 42xx motor which was 500kv because it was on clearance. Fried 4 of those before welcoming myself into the land of the 6374‚ÄôsüòÇ

I just got fed up with taking my lid off every time to change settings so I've got one of these through each side of the enclosure beside the charge port and power switch. Since I put them in I haven't changed my settings once though.  By the time I got them installed I had the thing dialled up sweet :joy:

That's one thing I really need to do some reading up on. The last thing I want to do is screw up my settings and end up hurting any of my equipment. I usually have to read something five or six times in multiple people's wordings before it sinks in, I'm better at learning Hands-On. And I just have not had the time to sit down and do such a thing.

Due to vibrations, it just goes off, since it's not flexible at all. I'm not saying it's bad for everything, but in rush, i tend to use it more and be sorry afterwards.

Could be another one here chaps.  Well named thread this.  Hot glue works on connectors etc because you can remove it at a push and it is an insulator.  Silicon (the name should give it away really) sealant is a great insulator also but only when its cured when in liquid or gel form apparently it conducts electricity so if using to glue connectors in, I would'nt.  Most release acetic acid too when curing which eats copper brass etc so always use a neutral cure product or say goodbye to small electronic connections down the line. Oh and its really messy shit. Sika is the best waterproofing agent around for holes and stuff but even messier.

superglue, hot glue all are fine for gluing connectors in but wet silicon be careful of plus its a bitch to get off once cured. Its the acid thing that's a worry because its not common knowledge.

**Nickel strip.** Im going to build a 10s6p pack and I thought in my mind "man you're not going to use more than 3 meters of nickel strip on that shit dude". Well turns out I actually need 11 meters to build the pack. Before you order nickel strip do the math. And just to be on the safe side order 2 more meters than you need.

Grass green lines are 10mm X 0.15mm nickel strip. The dark green lines is also nickel strip but it's making it a 1s6p pack. Blue lines are also nickel strip that connects the parallel packs into series. Red lines are 10 awg that does the same.

So then the **red lines**, the **pack +**, and the **pack -** connections are incorrect.

But even if you corrected them, that much complexity will lead to fast failure under heavy vibration.

So then you would connect it this way in a 10S6P configuration -- but again, this will last no longer than a stinky fart under heavy vibrations.

So I have this Maxfind esk8 that has a little 10s1p Liion battery pack which had gotten weak over the last year and a half, so I thought I'd just build a new one.  Carefully dissembled the pack, took lots of pictures, made sure I knew where every balance wire went.   Got new cells and assembled them all into the proper order.  Soldered the pos and neg connectors and all the balance wires to the pack.  

First mistake: manage to nick the insulation on a couple of the balance wires with the soldering iron without realizing it.   

Carefully taped up the cells and arranged the wires, and started getting excited to finish and hurrying.  

Second mistake:  didn't carefully mange the balance wires and route them out of the way.  Also didn't inspect them for damage.

Stuck the BMS on top of the pack just like the old one and started wrapping up the pack.  Immediately, 2 of the cells on one end start getting warm, then hot.  I'm not a (complete) idiot, lol, so I run full blast outside and toss the pack down in the gravel, unplug the balance wires connector and stand back.  The cells continue to fry for about 5 min, but never quite vent or catch fire.  When it cools off I test the pack and it's like 23V.  Tear it apart and I can see that I sandwiched the two nicked balance wires under the BMS, shorting them together and turning the middle 4 cells of the pack into a circular short.  

4 dead cells and a bunch of wasted time and money.   But I didn't burn myself or my house down, and learned a lesson, so it's all good.  

Be careful with your battery wiring, folks.   :slight_smile:

Rookie mistake I have made at least once, probably twice:

Not leaving space for wiring or underestimating how much space wiring takes up.

Definitely did it with my firefly remote where I made all the wiring way too long and couldn‚Äôt fit everything in.

Probably did it with my enclosure which I sized up based on the number and arrangement of 30Qs, bms, plus a focbox unity - but didn‚Äôt allow any space for the mostly 10AWG wiring.
