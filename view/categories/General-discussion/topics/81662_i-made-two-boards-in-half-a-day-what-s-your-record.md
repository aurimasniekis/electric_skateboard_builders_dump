I made/assembled two boards waiting for batteries to charge. This is uncommon for me, unheard of. I take forever and then some. 

What are your records for quick builds?

Obviously fit and finish are much to be desired, but they skate and that’s what matters. 

Pics or it didn’t happen:

But these are like your children, only the very best will do. 

What those times when someone is like, “yo! So-and-so from such-and-such is hanging out tonight, think you could throw something together that moves so we can all ride?”

If it was already built and I'm just taking apart and putting back together it won't take me long but a new build will take me weeks if I have all the parts cause I'm slow I guess lol

I could totally see you skinning a deck, enclosure, and remote along with assembling a firefly remote and applying glass frit in one day... sounds do-able

I feel like I do a lot of staring, thinking and planning.

Or some might say obsessing over main builds.  But I am starting some projects that are less detail oriented that I can knock out quickly I hope!

No offense but I think any builder will be way below and any pro builder will be way above.
