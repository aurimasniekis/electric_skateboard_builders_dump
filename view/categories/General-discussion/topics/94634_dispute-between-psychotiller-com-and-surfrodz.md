Hey all

I ordered some parts from Psychotiller.com quite a while ago (March) (enclosure, trucks /mounts etc) but is still to see this being sent!
I've been in touch with @psychotiller, but he says he can't ship the trucks now due to an unresolved dispute with the dudes at surfrodz. 

Question is, is anyone else having to wait on parts/trucks from him? 
Can someone shed some light on the issue here?

I know its been a super busy year for him. And not just esk8. Sounds like he's still talking with ya. Not really sure what this thread will resolve. 
2 months wait isn't unheard of or terribly long but i understand its frustrating.  Only person that can shed any light on the situation is Dave tho.

Ive purchased stuff from and have delt with Dave before and hes a stand up guy and stands behind his products, give him a chance to make you whole and he will. Sometimes these kind of set backs happen with esk8 parts but i can garantee you he wont leave you hanging.

I'm not averse to waiting, but was more worried about a dispute in our midst.. Surfrodz isn't exactly what I would call a community-based operation like @psychotiller is..

That being said, summer is upon us, and having a half built diy sitting in a short Norwegian summer isn't optimal ;)

@psychotiller is one of Surfrodz trucks biggest customers so im sure things will get straightened out soon.

I know the wait sucks esp with summer coming but that is esk8 for you these things happen even with prebuilt boards.

I'm dying to try them out. If only they offered free engravings lol

If I had to guess.  SR prolly raised hell (said cease & desist) with @psychotiller because his custom made trucks have a hex shape like the SR TKP's.  It'll never hold up as the shape is also very dissimilar.  

I would also argue that some of us, including me, have been asking SR for 200mm TKP's for 3 years and they weren't interested in doing them.  It seems childish to me that they would try to cause Dave grief over the fact that he is building something they refused to build (the same argument I used with the @Kaly deck vs. @trampa).  

I am assuming that is the issue, I do NOT know.  I haven't spoken with anyone at SR or Psychotiller about this.

This is so damn true.


I love SZ products.  Not the organization itself.  They suck at communicating, don't want to produce anything new, and even give false promises. 

I would love to know the amount of money Dave made them by adopting their product to esk8.  And now every swinging dick out there is using them.  Because of Dave.

If anything, they should have been bending over backwards to help themselves by helping Dave make surfrodz THE esk8 truck.  They did not.

This is like saying the Kaly Deck is a direct ripoff of trampa because they are both 35 degree decks made from composite material.

Both are bullshit IMO.  I have the trucks in front of me.  I also have like 6 sets of Surfrodz.   

Spoiler alert, they aren't the fucking same.  Yes they are both tkp skate board trucks.  That's it.  SZ is just mad Dave is moving on and not putting up with their bullshit any more.

Good on Dave.

After trying the new Liquid trucks, all I will say is that I will never purchase a Surf Rodz product, again.  

Back to back, the new Liquid trucks feel totally different than SR TKP or RKP.  I love them.

Surf Rodz is a side business of a precision machine shop that makes high-precision firearms, tools, other shiny things:  http://www.jvprecision.net/CNC-Machining-CT/ID/11/Defense

... and this is precisely why Surf Rodz has _never_ introduced a single product for us... Why would they, when margins are so much better on guns or tools?

Customer service lol.  Raise your hand if you think that Surf Rodz provides any of us the customer service we deserve.  

Most of us send in emails that are never answered, FB messages that aren't even read - and that's /after/ buying something.

Esk8 made Surf Rodz work, not the other way around - and now some old man threatens our makers with patents that he bought.  Well, we have a word for that in the legal industry: troll.

I'm sorry, but how do parents like this get passed? The descriptors practically include every precision skate truck in existence, and more vaguely, generalised skate trucks. Clearly not the invention/design of surfrodz. It's so frustrating to see creators stifling competition because they're too lazy to innovate.

What's equally stupid is how elementary it is to _bypass_ this patent (make hanger non-replaceable - that was hard).

Surf Rodz is not a skater-run brand, and it shows.  Always has, actually, which is why in gravity longboarding you very rarely see them, if ever.  

I've actually never seen a set outside of esk8 in-person, anywhere.**  You guys indirectly made me buy Surf Rodz, and I sure as Hell like them better than the AK-47 tolerances of TB218s... yet the Aera Carve is actually superior to anything Surf Rodz has ever made (in my opinion).

As I try to end on a positive note: I do like SR's colors and finish, and I wish them well as they sink back into irrelevance.  

To think many of us were like their Ambassadors for nothing, for free... wow.

** correction, I own an OG Bustin with Bustin-branded SR TKP

Just get a set of SR, they are still sweet trucks and ride amazingly. Use those mounts and worry about the next truck when it comes along.

No need to get the pitchforks out here gents, if the product was terrible I'd understand but my TKP's are leagues ahead of everything else I've ridden.

Still though, i need some precision trucks  to complete everything and SR just isnt an option at the moment. So whats out there thats a step up on the tb218’s that can fit 2 6374 bkb’s

I feel ya, but you will love the SR TKP's for the speeds you travel at.  Just dial in the bushings, experiment, do away with the garbage busings that come on them.  

Ive got a couple of boards that use TB218's, they aren't the greatest bu they ain't bad either, I mean they are $65 bucks.  I think they are a value at that price.

It's just such a shame that it has to come to patents and the 'hard line', instead of sharing and trying to find common advancements in our hobby!
Anyways, I hope that Dave is alright, all things considered.. and I know for my part that a SR-product will never be mounted to a board I make =)

So you guys know I'm alright. And from the things that have been brought up here, Most of which have nothing to do with their patent, We are not infringing on their design. The only thing they have a patent on is the "preferably removeable replaceable hanger with 2 screws drilled though their bushing seat and threaded into their hanger. "  Since ours go together differently, aren't removeable and we don't even sell replacement hangers there isn't an issue. 

Ours are different, and go to 11.
Theirs only go to 10.

Serious question: the liquid top trucks that @psychotiller had, what speed would they be good for? I know rule of thumb is rkp for high speed stability, tkp for low speed carving, but unfortunately very little support (or availability) for liquid rkp. 

Hoping I can get away with the tkp :x

I feel much less stable on SR tkps, I don't know anything about them feeling super stable. Maybe yes, compared to indys I guess.

And someone said earlier they never saw anyone on SR outside or prior to Esk8... I'll be one guy to tell you I rode SR prior to even realizing DIY Esk8 was a thing, but that's just me.

I know you're busy, but hopefully you can answer this.

I was literally gunna buy some surfrodz 2 nights ago. Looks like they're out of stock anyways.

I want to buy your new trucks. Nothing I've ever read about until now, so maybe they're not even new. 

Looks like you have TKP's up, and will have RKP by the end of the week.

I was going to buy Surfrodz RKP. I've never skated in my life. I have a board that will be able to go pretty wicked fast with some crazy torque. Half of its use is going to be my commute, so it needs to be stable and safe, as well as accomodation for 2x 6374 motors. Should I get your TKP's or RKP's?

Thanks

MMy personal opinion, speaking as one of the few who have tried both Surf Rodz and HeXLs; try the new HeXL TKPs, first, on the Jet Killshot or Red Ember 44, or any drop-down, top-mount deck that is not pre-angled.

This is the HeXL TKP and Jet Killshot:

![fullsizeoutput_234b|666x500](upload://3RHyrcd3BhY1w0qlfJQ3tXfjwmh.jpeg) 

This is a Surf Rodz RKP, with an adjustable base plate you likely will not find for sale, bolts from McMaster? as a hack to extend the axles (idk) with a bunch of aluminum spacers threaded on said bolt-axle, like beads, with Riptide bushings and Loctite.  We actually have an entire thread, here, dedicated to working around their design limitations to make Surf Rodz suitable for esk8.

![fullsizeoutput_2355|666x500](upload://nMkgBMepgupZVI32m6hchgMzsje.jpeg) 

I don't know any of us who can claim we took our Surf Rodz out of the box, mounted motors and zoom.

Well, that's how it works with that HeXL truck: you can take it out of the box, mount motors and zoom.

Of course, I think the HeXLs feel better than TKP Surf Rodz; if they didn’t feel better than Surf Rodz, why would anyone change to fewer colors.  HeXL made these for us. :) 

Either choice, you're better off with precision trucks.  Good hunting!

personally, I think you'll really like them.  I'm OG, too, and literally never saw them anywhere except on one Bustin OEM board from years back.  I thought they were stoked - and went right back to Aera.

Then it was precision TKP and I admit, I was wrong.  To me, precision TKP sounded like precision wheelbarrow lol.  What's the point?

turns out wobbles, or lack thereof, north of 30 MPH while we're leaning forward, is the point and Surf Rodz, if dialed in and dolled up, can perform like the HeXLs at 30 MPH sure.  Lot of the guys in this thread are the stoked chefs that came up with the Surf Rodz recipes that work.

I think all one would have to do is angle the base plates of SR TKPs accordingly, as the HeXLs are angled TKPs.  

The solution to angle SR TKP base plates is to buy SR adjustable base plates for an extra $150 (if you want drop-through or top-mount) or just buy risers (top-mount only).

I personally love the shoulder bolt axles.
I've now had the same pair of trucks on three completely different boards with different wheel bases and widths.

Running 6374? Long axles and push the mounts out as far as I can. Running 6355? Shorter axles and slide my motor plates over. Regardless of what motors I run I can keep the spacing to just a few millimeters between cans.
I don't always want the widest stance possible

Another smart question. 

The hexagonal “hanger” is shaped that way because that’s how the aluminum stock comes from the supplier; anyone can order that aluminum stock online. 

Surf Rodz outright threatened Psychotiller with legal action over this: if anyone uses readily available hexagonal aluminum stock as a hanger, one must attach a bushing seat to said aluminum hexagonal stock. 

Now, heaven may not forbid you to use screws to connect common hexagonal stock to a bushing seat - but if you use screws with heads, even if permanently loc-tited in, based on what I’ve observed as an outsider, one can expect immediate legal threats from Surf Rodz. 

They don’t care about us. 

This bears repeating: after three years of asking, Surf Rodz has refused to simply cut a piece of standard aluminum stock 40 mm longer for this community 

When one of our own builders does it for us, Surf Rodz appears with threats to the very builder that helped put them on the map - over _two screws_.  Stupid twice because they’re not manufactured or branded Psychotiller. 

Anyway, here’s the good news: I’m fairly certain most mounts that all makers fabricated for hexagonal stock hangers will work on HeXLs, today.

Hey Guys,

I want to throw my 2 cents worth in here. Even though there have been many, many trucks featuring removable/replaceable hangers over the past several decades and IMHO SurfRodZ should _NEVER_ have been granted that patent, but they did so others couldn't. It was a shitty move. They did it. They got it. No big. If someone were to produce removable/replaceable hangers it would infringe on the patent, and if not, it wouldn't. SurfRodZ didn't do their homework and accused Psychotiller of selling trucks that infringed. He hadn't, doesn't, and won't, and he told them that, so he fully expects them to go away.

The new trucks in question bear the HeXL name, not Liquid. The trucks are now, and have always been, permanently secured together using tamper-proof fasteners, permanent chemical bonding and/or permanent welds. HeXL has never desired nor intended to produce a truck that can be taken apart by its customers. HeXL has not ever, and will not ever sell separate or replacement hangers that don't include the permanently affixed bushing seat and pivot. HeXL has no intention of making removable/replaceable hanger parts in the future. The trucks are currently being released with a limited number of options. The additional options are listed below the initial options.

**_Initial HeXL Options:_**

**RKP and TKP Hanger Width:**  240mm 

**RKP and TKP Baseplate Angles:**  45° and 35°

**RKP and TKP Color Options:**  Raw 

**RKP and TKP Bushing Options:**  Tall (.750") Barrels in 92a and 95a Reflex


**_Future HeXL Options:_**

**RKP and TKP Hanger Width:**  220mm, 240mm, 260mm 

**RKP and TKP Baseplate Angles:**  50°, 45°, 40°, 35° and 30°

**RKP and TKP Color Options:**  Raw and Black

**RKP and TKP Bushing Options:**  Tall (.750") FatCats in 80a, 85a and 90a RipTide APS

HeXL Trucks are designed for Esk8 and should be used in splits. The standard split angles are 45° fronts and 35° backs for both the RKP and TKP builds. HeXL recommends that you NEVER use the same truck in the back as you do in the front unless of course you like speed wobbles, instability, and inefficient carving.  

Psychotiller will have great hex motor mount clamps and plates and the 6374 motors will easily fit on the 240mm hangers.

HeXL is making _wide_ hangers with 5/16" axles (8mm nominal) that accept Biltin and every other 608 style bearing. 

I'm running 260mm hangers with a 45°/35° split on my RKP Quad (4WD) with Six Shooters and 42T pulleys and I am stable at 50mph. It's scary as all hell, but I'm old and fragile.

I'm running 220mm hangers with a 50°/30° split on myTKP Dual (2WD) with Six Shooters and 60T pulleys and I am stable at 30mph. It's pretty amazing because my experience with "other" TKPs has not been very stable.

Well designed trucks, bushings and baseplate splits make a huge difference. The few skaters who have ridden HeXLs felt the difference instantly.

I personally hate to use wedge pads or under/over sized bushings to change steering angles. Get the baseplate angle that you want and mount it to a deck with a horizontal mounting plane. Once you know what you like, you will NEVER want to deal with an adjustable baseplate, a wedge pad, or bad bushing alignment.

I also hate axle spacers (as opposed to wheel spacers) because once again, once you know what hanger width you need, get that hanger. I hate 10mm bearings, I hate shoulder bolts, I hate kingpins with allen heads. Don't get me started on kingpins that thread into the baseplate ...

Am I the only one who realizes what a HATER I am?

BTW, a 50°/35° split great ... very old school in that the early Randal R-II baseplates were 50° and the R-I (Downhill) baseplates were 35° so downhillers cannibalized the two different trucks for early splits.

![liquid-20attack2_800x800|601x500](upload://gQVhrkUms8HDEYl1w5fEhgAXDb4.jpg)

 I don’t mind the threaded bolt to the baseplate but I do find the shoulder bolt thing a little annoying because to change a wheel or bearing you have to take the hole bolt off.

Yeah the 50/30 or 35 setup would be awesome smooth and turny in the front and stable at the back. If riptide makes the pivot cups I’m sold cause all my trucks have riptide pivots

Okay, that's a relatively small amount of "acceptable" misalignment. I thought you wanted to use a ThikCup and change the bushing height by .150" ... That's excessive ...

The ThikCup is used to make a short (.600") bushing the same as a tall (.750") bushing and maintain perfect alignment ...

lmao. I know my problem was simply not knowing what standard skateboard length meant.

I've never skate before, nor does googling a standard length come up with results. Maybe that means I shouldn't be playing with such nice trucks for my first build.

I think there might aaalso be a very slight... Length vs Width thing going on. Me being a dumbass is more likely. So, hangar width is 240mm. What portion of that width is hex, which portion is 8mm diameter axle. By saying length of axle, you'd technically be referring to diameter (which we all should be on the same page... 8mm) and not the "width portion of the entire truck that is 8mm rod and not Xmm hex"

But it's probably me, not you ;P

I spent my day working with a single threaded rod that had 8 reduction adapters on in all having mixed ends of NPT/BSPT/BSPP when there literally wasn't a reason it could all be one thread.

Not one single reason.

Which is why it was my job to make one replacement of the current fuckers we're using, and then design a brand new one using a single unified fitting.

My brain is fried.

The skateboarding world is very dumb about a lot of specs. Longboarders attempt to make things a bit easier, but not all of them.

**The Truck World According to Chris Chaput:**

10mm axles are NOT where the industry is going. Narrow width, smaller balls and bigger raceway diameters means that the balls have to spin way faster than 608 balls bearings with an 8mm bore. 10mm is inefficient and unnecessary.

Call axles by what they are - 5/16", and not 8mm unless they take an 8mm locknut, which they DON'T. The diameter is 5/16", 5/16" nominal, or 8mm nominal, but never 8mm. Because the threading is 5/16"-24 it takes a 5/16"-24 locknut with 1/2" between the flats of the hexagon. Kingpins and mounting hardware also use Imperial sizing. Your skate key knows this. 

If you have an axle diameter that is between .312" and .313" you rock, and .3125" is 5/16" and works great. Sure .308" to .311" still works, but why make an axle for a precision bearing and remove the precision? .314" is too big and will get stuck on your axles. Really.

You should have your axles extending 1 5/16" (1.3125") beyond the end of the (aluminum) hanger. 
Thread the last 3/8" (.375") of the axle using 5/16"-24 threads. No more, no less. It really is that simple but no one else does this.

The truck width is measured from the two faces at the ends of the aluminum hanger, whether or not there is a washer feature cut into the ends of the hanger. Longboarders measure this in millimeters, same as their wheels. Shortboard guys use inches, and often give you a stupid axle-tip-to-axle-tip measurement that doesn't tell you how wide the hanger is because they don't have a standard axle length coming out of the hanger. They do bad math and ballpark 1.5" of axle per side and say that an 8" axle is like a 5" hanger. Indy likes to confuse this further by giving you a model number like 129 or 139 which is not how wide the hanger is in millimeters. Argh.

Wheel spacers are NOT 10mm and if they were, they wouldn't work. The standard bearing spacing in a skateboard wheel is .400" (10.16mm) which means that wheel cores should be a little _less_ than that (.385" to .398") and bearing spacers should be a little _more_ than that (.401" to .404"). This way the bearings don't bind when you tighten them all the way which you should always do. Quad rollerskate wheels use a .300" spacing and lube from Your Little Pony.

If you have Biltin bearings in quality wheels on nice strong steel 5/16" axles and tighten them up all the way, they act like a big thick solid steel axle and won't bend or break.

How'd they get it right? That was me. Then they started selling 80mm axles. Without even saying thanks for making their set up work. 
And spacers, and axles that seize up in the hanger.. it's not as good as a true 240mm hanger and 5/16" axle. Never will be.

I don't think anyone in here does not recognize the part you had in making SR famous in the esk8 community.

FWIW, I played a bit with spacers to narrow my truck and would make it work with 70mm bolts. 

But this is not what I am talking about. With a hexagonal hanger and a width of eg 200mm you have the option of moving everything in for use on a shorter board and 6355 motors and using spacers and longer bolts for 6380 motors on another board. IMO it is a much more flexible system.

You can't do that with a true 240mm hanger.

You should have your axles extending 1 5/16" (1.3125") beyond the end of the (aluminum) hanger.

1.3125 inch is 33mm. Not sure if that includes 5-7mm for the locknut? 

But if you want a pulley with a bearing, it would be 3x7mm wide 608 bearings plus 10mm spacer = 31mm plus the thread. 

I think it's a shame if that setup is not possible. A bearing in the pulley really helps reduce the torsional load on the pulley / wheel. And helps it all stay concentric.

Dickyho has a pulley where the inside bearing is a 10mm wide one that extends into the pulley 3mm only, so maybe that could work.

No. The bearing is what holds the pulley on the wheel. 

The point being 2 things.  1) pulleys always straight.   2) force is directed to the axle rather than the core of the wheel.

Nope! I’m sure the trucks are awesome and I don’t care if they resemble anything else. 

But saying imperial hardware is somehow an advantage I don’t get it.

If you could have an eska8 with 100% imperial hardware that would be awesome for Americans and a few small nations. 

But don’t all esk8s have some metric hardware? I have not seen any motors that use imperial hardware? 

Since moving to surfrodz I have 100% metric and only need these tools for every bolt / nut on the board, a skate tool takes up way more space. I carry these in a small zip lock.

```
The past, current, and future will ALWAYS be a combination of metric and Imperial sizes for skateboarding components. Bearing seats are 22mm x 7mm but the bearing spacing is .400". The 608 bearing is "Metric" 22mm x 7mm x 8mm bore but has balls that are 5/32". In longboarding the hanger width, wheel diameter, wheel width, and contact patch is measured in millimeters, but the track width (outside edges of the wheels when mounted on trucks) is measured in inches because we measure the width of the deck in inches. Axles are Imperial, kingpins are Imperial, mounting hardware is Imperial, bushings are Imperial. Most baseplate "plate" dimensions are Imperial because both the Old School hole pattern (2.500" x 1.625") and New School hole pattern (2.125" x 1.625") are absolutely Imperial. The deck length, width, and wheelbase is Imperial. 

Now OF COURSE there are more countries that use the Metric system than there are Imperial. This means that for many skaters it is difficult to source Imperial hardware and tools. Euros and Asians and African skaters often use M5 machine screws and locknuts to mount trucks to the deck which means that the 3/8" socket on the skate key doesn't help. But they don't put M8 locknuts that require a 13mm wrench on the 5/16"-24 axles because they don't fit. Also it's difficult for people who don't deal with "inches" often to understand Imperial sizing so they translate from inches to millimeters or centimeters. In the US we don't know what a good price is for a liter of gas - we need to see it in gallons. 

Imperial isn't BETTER than Metric. Imperial just happens to be what skateboard parts were designed in when skateboards became popular in the states (1960's). "Standards" were developed over time and whenever someone has tried to come up with some new proprietary system it has failed miserably. eXkate had a 12mm spacer in their larger wheels. REJECT!  Kryptonics used wheels with roller-skate cores and the .300" spacer ... REJECT!  Unless there is an overwhelming great reason to change what works, it's easier to ride a horse in the direction it's going. Skateboarding will use BOTH Imperial and Metric. The Esk8 segment will increase the number of Metric components because almost every motor and electronic device uses Metric parts.

I love being able to disassemble, assemble, and make all necessary adjustments with a skate key that fits in my pocket. Esk8 requires us to add some Metric Allen wrenches into the mix, but I don't tend to change motors, enclosures, and mounts, and pulleys while riding.

Looks like you will be married to SurfRodZ which will most likely never design or make trucks for the Esk8 community. They LOVE forcing people to change a wheel or bearing by removing a shoulder screw after (hopefully) remembering to unscrew the set/grub screws so you don't destroy your axles. They LOVE forcing skaters to carry around Metric Allen wrenches instead of a skate key that you still need to take the trucks off the deck. They LOVE forcing skaters to use an Allen key on the kingpin to tighten their trucks. They LOVE short bushings with no cup washers or even flat washers. They LOVE sloppy bushing seats as does Paris. They love giving you narrow hangers and axle spacers instead of giving you the hanger width you really want. They love bearings with a 10mm bore because that's what you need when you put axle spacers between your hanger and your wheel.

Psychotiller did a good job of adapting them so that they could work with Esk8, but I'd rather use trucks that were designed for electric skateboards by people who ride electric skateboards.

Your kingpin is 3/8" in diameter and has 3/8"-24 threads on it and the locknut fastened to it has 9/16" between the flats. They put a dome shaped head on the kingpin so you can never invert the kingpin and put the head in the baseplate and the locknut on a (cup) washer above the top bushing. As long as you like that and ONLY that configuration, you can take your bendy little M5 Allen wrench and tighten up those short bushings instead of using a proper wrench or socket/ratchet. If you want taller bushings you're out of luck, and  even if you did they don't make different length kingpins to support them. If you grind the hex feature on the or strip it, you can't just go out and get a new 10 cent locknut, you have to order a new kingpin from Connecticut. 

If you love the SZ world and plan on never quitting it, don't worry, be happy. But just hope that SZ never quits the non-Esk8 longboard market, as so many others have.

Currently the Psychotiller Six Shooter rims have pulleys bolted onto them. There are no "press-fit" pulleys for Six Shooters. They work great and as a result I've never had a misaligned belt or felt as if the belt tension on the pulley skewed the wheels or was causing a problem. 

On urethane wheels with "spoke holes" in the core, you can bolt on pulleys and expect the same result as with the Six Shooters. Once I fasten pulleys to a wheel, I keep them there until I wear out the wheel, just as I put bearings in a wheel and keep them there. Bolting pulleys on a urethane wheel isn't pretty, but it works well. 

Having a press-fit pulley in a urethane wheel isn't a bad idea, but there are a few challenges that have to be dealt with before you can be happy, joyous and free. First of all, where are all of these perfectly designed pulleys and what bearings do they use and what is the standard for bearing positioning? In order to answer that question you have to know what wheel/core you are using, what bearings or speed ring is on the axle, and where the pulley positions the bearing before you can make a hanger that accepts the pulley bearing perfectly. I've included a rendering of a pulley and a bearing that fits on a hex hanger perfectly. These dimensions are critical. The cylindrical section of the hanger has to hold the bore of the bearing using a decent slip-fit. The ledge where that cylinder terminates acts as a stop for the pulley bearing and must be positioned perfectly or it will bind the bearing (too close to the end of the hanger) or it will allow the pulley and/or bearing to slide side to side. 

The bearing I'm showing has a 19mm bore and a 30mm OD. When the "ledge" is about 22mm from the end of the hanger, the bearing is actually underneath the teeth of the pulley. Some companies (who will remain nameless) have a pulley bearing that's more in line with the pulley's flange and doesn't really do all that much.

You can get great concentricity when you cut the axle holes, cylinder, and hanger face all in the same clamping in a lathe using a hex collet. I think that you'll probably see this as a feature once a number of great plastic-injection-molded pulleys that fit genuine Flywheel cores become available. I want to make pulleys that can be bolted on (without the bearing) OR press-fit in (with the bearing). The hangers would work perfectly with either ...

Dave will be shipping everything he has now and everything that people are ordering now will ship soon. 

Again, the claims in the SurfRodZ patent protects them from anyone making removable and replaceable hangers. As long as any multi-part hanger system implements permanent securement, there is no infringement and there is no issue. 

What I find interesting is how in the hell they got the patent in the first place. To obtain a patent the invention must be novel, non-obvious, and useful. "Novel" means new, where there is no "prior art" which means that the invention can't be anything that has been written about in a publication, anything that is already being sold in the open market, or anything already patented. 

I designed, published, and sold removable/replaceable hangers in 2001. I even shared the idea with Radikal Trucks who sold them as well. Although these are RKPs and no one is going to grind (wear) through a 1/2" steel hanger, you can swap out longer or shorter hangers using the cap screws.  RKPs and TKPs have been done like this for decades.

In the other patent they claim the removable/replaceable hangers.

I'll re-post this rendering which shows a cross section of an axle stud and not a through axle. I didn't model any fastening detail but that wouldn't effect a pulley bearing anyway. The model of the bearing has a 19mm bore and a 30mm OD and the “ledge” at the end of the hanger cylinder is about 22mm from the end.

Now that nice wide trucks are becoming available I may have to revisit the original 107mm Electric Flywheel and see what it would take to make a custom wheel pulley to handle the extra 12mm of width on the _inside_ of the wheel. Not unlike the 6x3 pneumatic tires these urethane monsters are also 3" wide (76.2mm) and depending on the chamfer size, you can have up to a 70mm contact patch.

Here's a sample of the 107mm South Park Flywheel (Bigger, Longer, and Uncut) ...
