Hello Everyone,
I am new to this, So Lets get to it :" I am Having so many problems with my Raptor 2.1.
I forked over alot of money plus warranty and I am Having a A terrible Time with their Customer Service I've been waiting for Over 60 days.. and Just some Random Fake Emails from bots."

I Need help Badly. Please Help me.
I charged The board to 100%, then in the morning I used the board to get to my job. It takes about 45 min to ride to my job, After Getting to my job I went about to set up the board to be charged while my shift will end and I can ride back to my 2nd Job, However this time the Light on the charging Brick was Green.
I thought to myself "that's  weird it's at 52% it shouldn't be done already".

And it wasn't, It wasn't charging.

So after my shift for my first job, I headed back to my home on its Last Leg.
After getting home I took apart the board and went on many forms about this problem and I can not find anything about it.


Thus here the Overview 
Board Doesn't charge And When I plug in the Brick into the Board The Light is Green (Not Red*Charging). and nothing Happens.
