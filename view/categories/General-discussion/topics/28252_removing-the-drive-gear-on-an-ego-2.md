I am trying to remove the drive gear on the motor wheel on the ego 2. Is there an easy and safe way for me to do this?

Doesn't look like it's gonna come apart.

What's going on? Why do you want to take it apart?

As far as I know, the only way is to cut it out

Hey thanks for the response guys. Yeah it seems like cutting it out is the only way. The reason I wanted to take it out is because I got some Mbs all terrain wheels  on amazon and wanted to throw those on there. 

I ended up ordering the drive gear for the ego from board bumpers instead. Which worked out better because it says that the drive gear that I ordered  fits inside the Mbs wheels.

I got the same wheels for my ego2, and ordered new gear from boardbumpers, looks like a few months of waiting for it for though. For now replaced my front wheels with the MBS wheels :slight_smile:
