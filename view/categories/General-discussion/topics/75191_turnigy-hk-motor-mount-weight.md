They are pretty light. I have 2 pairs at home but IDK how I'ma gonna weight it. I don't recommend them tho. Better get boardnamic or dickyho mounts if you are on a budget. I heard you are also in Berkeley I can lend/gift you a pair cuss I'm not gonna use them.

Don't remember why but didn't like them. I think they aren't mirrored. And they don't fit well. Also don't think they fit very well. No idler.

I agree with @Winfly. They are terrible, they don't fit well and wiggle lose over time. Please don't buy them. I would go with the @e.board_solutions or @dickyho motor mount. :smile:

They are designed for single drive so they are not a pair.  They only work dual if you go diagonal.
