hi guys! just wanna share my 4th experience getting my board through TSA; this time being at LAX for my 2nd time.

basically I brought a spare motor which raised some eyebrows but they basically asked "is this a motor?" and i replied "yes its an electric motor".

they then examined my tools, which was just my allen wrench tool and pliers. lastly they picked up my battery and asked if it was a battery and I said "yes!". they wiped it down, tested the wipe cloth, then sent me on my way! 

As with the last 3 times, I had a friend stand by to take my battery home if not let through

lets chat! thanks guys!

When your battery suffers a cascade failure in the overhead it's all the rest of us that will suffer... 

Be responsible, UPS will deliver it safe and sound.

Do you guys use Lipo bags when traveling?

can you explain how the cascade failure is unique to a technically over the limit battery? the total amount of lithium is within limitations and I dont see how the cascade failure wouldnt be just as much of an issue within the legal capacity requirements

I personally dont because I dont use one in any other capacity like when charging. in the case of a spontaneous combustion it would help, but thats a whole separate issue; your batteries shouldnt just unexpectedly explodem Im happy to be proven wrong, but the way I understand it is just the same way your batteries will be fine sitting idle while youre at work I believe it will be fine in a pressurized cabin for a few hours.

I have flown with a pack made of prebuilt lipos before but never with a diy battery pack.

So a 99wh fire is just as bad as a 200wh fire I think is what he's saying. Both a legal and illegal battery fire are just as bad

ahh i see, definitely use the strictest judgement when deciding to take a diy pack. my battery was bought from a maker in the community, its extremely well made and has lasted over a year with still no signs of degrading. Ive left it unsupervised for 4 weeks and had no issues, so Im very confident in the quality control and safety of the pack. 

dont chance it if you arent 1000% sure your pack is solid.

i think thats basically the case. you can bring 360wh of lithium, just not in a 10s4p format. it has to be 3 separate batteries, to which I am questioning if a cascade failure is in any way related to my pack being a technically illegal configuration of a legal amount of lithium

Amount of lithium doesn't exponentially creates bigger fire. Cellphone battery is just as bad as ur 360wh battery. (remember Samsung?) 
Actually BB official mangers always travel with extended battery which is more than 99wh. So it's not just DIY community doing this.

I think it's manufactured battery shows more failure than hand made because they mass produce and easy to be superficial about the construction of the pack.

I thought it was 99wh but I stand corrected if it's 360wh in a 3pack format.

If it wasnâ€™t for the Samsung note and unhoverboard fires from a few years ago, we probably wouldnâ€™t have this 99wh restriction. But if an Esk8 fire happens, Iâ€™m willing to bet these restriction would likely be a complete ban

I have 0 interest in travelling with diy board. It's just awkward. But I'm just pointing out the "officials" have been making these issues because of such large numbers.

All it would take was one bomb built into a esk8  like the shoe bomb .....isn't that the reason everyone has to take their shoes off and smell foot funk

Be careful -- because altitude/pressure changes is likely something you cannot/did not test your pack for.  So it's essentially untested in that environment.

Good point. Never thought about that Lipo puffs and less pressure can puffs lipo more.
At the same time air is more chill and dry.

360wh sounds like good amount of capacity to have after landing :slight_smile:

Cool that let u through. So is the pack divided in 3 pieces or it is one 360wh?

[/quote]

If the cabin was sufficiently pressurised so that your battery would feel no pressure difference, then your ears would also feel no pressure difference, which is definitely not the case.

360wh is perfect for me, I have a tiny board thats very lighweight so I usually get 25-30 miles out of it. I forgot a washer though and now my drive wheels isnt working right ðŸ˜«ðŸ˜«ðŸ˜«ðŸ˜« take inventory of everything and bring spares of EVERYTHING!!

What kind of labelling do you have on your battery? Would you mind sharing a picture?

I've flown with my 99wh Riptide battery - no issues.  I took the battery out and threw it in my backpack.  Rest of the board I checked.   

Printed this out 2x and laminated.  One for my backpack, and one in the checked bag.

theres no labels per se, just @barajabali  brand stickers! the abrasions on the labels are from the rubber shell I made to house the battery, thats over a year of vibration and its still not worn through the thin sticker, just some ink transfer. the blue tape has been also abraised to reveal the small rubber pad underneath.  ![20180727_140805|281x500](upload://rYG6JeHDRHEPtks8w2cz2Q3Do6N.jpg)![15327150939482320536887533522491|690x388](upload://97sx6K13g1ox49gYp66bCu0UOf2.jpg)

thats dramatic and a separate issue not related to eskate. if thats the case, people with electric wheel chairs couldnt fly either because of the similarities. also, using a high voltage battery pack to power a bomb is not something exclusive to lithium batteries, it is ALSO a separate issue.

Guys, don't forget US screening is almost the easiest in the world ;) Europe guys should be more careful as here sometimes bigger power banks are not even allowed ;)

good point! in my experience so far Barcelona and London Gatwick literally didnt even ask any questions, everything when right through. LAX has asked questions twice but only asked if it was a battery and if they could wipe it to test for explosives. Im in Tampa and am more nervous about their security to be honest...not mostly forward thinkers in this town and Im worried they wont like the battery/motors

The rules about this topic are really confusing and not consistent at all.

I found [airlines that allow batteries up to 300Wh](https://wowair.co.uk/customer-service/faq/luggage/which-items-are-prohibited-board/) (although this one does not allow _Small personal transportation devices powered by lithium batteries, including hoverboards, balance wheels, and scooters._).

Then again, the airline is not doing the security checks. So they don't have a way to enforce it.
So it seems like as long as the Airport Security let's you through you're good to go.

I am soon moving from north america to europe and am really wondering wether I should just put my 10S3P battery in my carry-on and see how it plays out.
Worst case scenario would be that I have to leave my battery behind which I would have to do anyways.

I went through 2 airport security checkpoints in Europe, one in Barcelona and one in London and literally neither even batted an eye. I just made it through my 5th TSA checkpoint now, again this one way just a wipe down testing for any explosive residue. If you travel frequently I would highly recommend TSA precheck just in case you ever are in a situation where you would need to leave you battery with a friend or something and need to go through the lines twice
