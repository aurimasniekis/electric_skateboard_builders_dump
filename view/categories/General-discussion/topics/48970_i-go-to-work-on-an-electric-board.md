Korea has become warmer from today.
So I go on an electric board to work.

I'm planning on ditching the car for daily commute. I do worry a little I'll enjoy my ride so much I won't want to go to work and I'll keep on going till my battery dies ;)

I ditched my car and use my esk8 to get everywhere.  I feel like I wasn't actually living before I ditched the car.  Life itself is an order of magnitude better.

I was living in Brussels for 6 years like 3km from work but there the clouds didn't allow me to skate at all, now back in Madrid currently saving money living in a property of my family at no cost, just more fuel than usual :slight_smile:

But skate commuting will happen sooner or later, just a matter of time.
