Hi Esk8 

I was just wondering if could cut out the teeth on my plastic wheel pulley to achive a different gear ratio?<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/8/d/8d50603134c9e063ab88d697d498e6009fb5f8e7.jpg" width="690" height="458">
It currently has 60 teeth and i wish to get it down to 36 any suggestions.

No.
you need to replace the whole thing.

It's not exactly the teeth that matter in drive ratios. It's the diameter of each pulley. 
We just happen to set htd 5m pitch as our standard in the skateboard industry and we talk about teeth as if they are the reason for different drive ratios. 

Chopping off teeth would decrease the diameter a bit but not in the way you want it.

Replace the pulley on your wheel with a smaller one or get a larger one for your motor.
