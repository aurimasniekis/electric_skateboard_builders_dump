What mountain board did u use to make electric? I am going to start an eMTB build in the coming months and was wondering what board to use. Trampa Is the obvious choice, but they are $600 (Ish). . I don't mind spending the money, just wondering what replacements or comps are out there..

Thanks for the help!

Which drive gear though? I'm looking into an offroad setup myself.

i like trampa decks with flame trucks (dirtpipe) and wheels(Cryptics with 9" stryker tires).

@Nowind makes a pretty killer mount / drive system for trampa. @barajabali used his mounts for his build

Would the trampa tires be able to go over sand, like at the beach? Thanks for the link

Hard Sand will be possible.
But for loose dry sand you need bigger wider tires.

You can test to decrease the air pressure on the StrikerÂ´s, so you get less surface pressure.
I did this often for kitelandboarding, it makes a big difference!

Depends on the type of sand.
On some harder sand it will work, but with way less grip.
On soft, fine sand, you will sink, no chance to get traction.

This is not only for trampa tires, even eMTBs have their limitations.

Along these lines, I'd like to know if anyone uses a mountainboard for commuting. I've always imagined it would be impractical to take an mountainboard on a train or into a store. Does anyone do it?

Late Post I know.. :D 

I took my mountainboard into a store once.. was a real burden to carry it around.. glad I did not have to buy a lot of things :D

That's why I think it is a good idea to follow @paragon and build a ''hybrid'' board..
= Short deck with pneumatic wheels
