No, I can not. I found this group, clicked "join" but didn't get access. And now I think group is hidden as well...

Not particularly You, but anyone who can and want to warn other members. I dont want to say anything specific ,I think link to this GB will speak for it self...  It always good to know what happened so look at last couple hundred  posts...
