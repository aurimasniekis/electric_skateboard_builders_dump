Just wanted to drop a line for everyone about to enjoy the holiday.  There are very few places like this forum. All kinds of people from all places able to exchange ideas, banter and camaraderie. Thanks @onloop for this forum and everyone else for your contributions, humor, interesting conversation and most importantly friendships.

Constipated children screaming, family in town, dog eats the breakfast off the table, taking trash out in the freezing cold in flip flops, beer at 10am cause why not? Good times, happy holidays, merry Christmas yall!
