In June I bought 4 170kv 8085 motors, 4, 6s 10,000 mah packs and 2 12s bms.

I  got the motors in 9 days. It's been over 2 months for the batteries and BMS.

My boards have been waiting batteries for a month while my Alien rep Bruno keeps telling me 5 days,

5 days.

    I've already been through the deception with Enertion, I ordered 2 Unity's and 2 remotes from them back in June. 2weeks later I realized they were crooks so I bought the 2, 6.6 FSESC and 2 remotes from Flipsky.
Little did I know that Alien was gonna screw me too. I can't get any honest information from Alien.
 I just don't have the money to go order more batteries so I'm held hostage by Alien. It really sucks looking at my boards everyday knowing I can't ride them because the ALIEN folks aren't being honest.
  Does anyone have any suggestions?

Thats awesome. I have been looking at battery spot welding videos, techniques and equipment all morning.
The little voice in my head has been telling me to shut the f---k up and learn to make my own packs because thats what the serious cats are doing. 
I'm not so good at quiet waiting anyway so there you have it. Thanks Saul!

I guess I am quietly waiting THIS TIME! Cheers!
