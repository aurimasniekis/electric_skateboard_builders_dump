G'day Fellow Aussies.
Thought it would be a good idea to have a topic for people in Australia where we can discuss offshore purchasing, shipping, group buys, laws, evading magpies, fanatical cyclists at peak hour and of course sport.
Post here about any local suppliers you may have found.

I'm looking at buying several of dunkirks enclosures. [Here's his work](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/custom-enclosures-for-sale-design-your-own/7485) I've got 2 vanguards to work on so am after his 50mm cases. 
He's charging 30 euro per piece plus $35 euro tracked shipping. Postage is the same up to 10 enclosures where shipping becomes free !!!! @dunkirk for clarity !

Yep - bought heaps! Quality stuff!
One question, the vescs that suffered from the multliplication firmware bug ? Are they covered by warranty??

if you have the platinum warranty all faults, even user errors is covered, we will send an instant replacement.

when I bought my vesc, way back in May, there was no such way to buy a warranty seperately. A firmware fault would be classed as a manufacturing fault I would have thought

He builds custom packs - $1 more per cell than I could buy them for.
