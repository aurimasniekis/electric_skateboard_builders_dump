Hi eRiders,

I'm planning my trip with a friend on the West coast of USA this summer and I'm wondering if along my path, I could meet some of you ! :slight_smile: 
I'll land in Los Angeles on 24th July and fly back from Los Angele as well on 15th August.

We plan to do the typical tourist tour :smile: (natural parks, Las Vegas, maybe San Francisco if enough time...).

So if you're in these areas, that would be amazing to visit some of you ! :+1:

It's a shame that I couldn't bring my board because of batteries but anyway, I'll buy at least a pushed longboard once in L.A. ;)

Cheers mate,

Cl√©ment, froggy traveller

Thank you so much guys !! :relieved:

I don't know if I could keep an eBoard all along my trip as we're travelling only with backpacks. Maybe a push board at least.
However, if you have some spare time to have a drink and tell us some advices for visiting the aera It would be so great !!
(and for sure, rent an eBoard for sightseeing will be even more amazing :smile: ).
