Hey everyone....

Some of you guys are pretty active on social media...and so am I. 

A while back I started @Esk8_Squad on Instagram as a way to promote electric skateboarding via reposting other accounts photos and videos. I found that IG is a great place to promote what we all love to people that are new to esk8. 

Today, I just opened up a facebook group page Esk8Squad https://www.facebook.com/groups/313675222393201. I invite you to post up your pictures and videos, post up different group ride events in your city or cities that you are visiting. I'm not looking to replace this forum. I do want to promote esk8 in a way that is accessible to the demographic that will be future Esk8er's. 

Please join my group! Let's expand the community out to the rest of the non-forum world.

So you all know...I'll be the only admin about the moment.  Post up.  Be nice. And share the shred! 


Facebook Group Page: (Open Group - For NOW)

Thank you guys and gals!

Thanks man :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
Plenty of love up in Montreal, so far the greatest place  to ride, from the people to the city. They close the highway on Saturday night we went all out. 

Keep up the good work promoting the life style.

This brought back memories of a time an ex-girlfriend of mine (who was a stripper) #mybad  Stabbed me in the leg with a fork in a restaurant. Yes. I was talking shit. May have deserved it.

I bought a shirt.

Let me just add:

I created Esk8Squad on IG to basically "spread the shred"... it's a great avenue to promote and share...a picture is worth a thousand words, right? 

Please feel free to create your own Esk8Squad account with an added handle.. I.E. @esk8squadUK @esk8squadboston @esk8squadkorea .... by people doing that just makes my job easier.

Helps us out by linking back to your squad shirts ... and just repost the best of esk8 your own way.

If anyone is wondering how I pick the pictures I repost on IG.

I pick photos based on how interesting the photos or videos are regardless of the brand or person.

I try to avoid any reckless videos that would shed a negative light on esk8... i.e. Anything that looks like it's against the law ... dangerous is ok cause esk8 is dangerous 

Some people wear helmets and some people don't..it's just the way skating is at the moment so I show all riders.

I will help promote events ...if you ask me... sometimes I'll do it myself 

I will start promoting your group rides on IG ...I'm just figuring a way to do it....

That's abt it...if I think of anything I'll edit below

Launch the create tool (looks like a pencil).

Select the logo on the shirt.

A bunch of swatches appear on the right.  Click on the +.  This brings up all the color options.  Choose gold.

Done!

Is there any chance of us getting a copy of the original vector art so we can customise ourselves to add our own cities without having to get you to make them?
