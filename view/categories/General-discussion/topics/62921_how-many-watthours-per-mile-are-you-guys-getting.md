18 Wh/mi = 11.2 Wh/km low-end
to
35 Wh/mi = 21.8 Wh/km high-end

I'm fat and like to be full-acceleration or full braking :slight_smile:

You have a really good Wh/mi ratio if that’s on hills and fast speeds

Last ride to the grocery store and back I was 20 Wh/mile. 
Never clocked it when out joyriding, although it'd be interesting to see since there's really steep hills
