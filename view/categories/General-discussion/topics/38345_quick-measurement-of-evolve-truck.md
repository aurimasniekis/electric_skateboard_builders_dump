so this question goes out to all evolve board owners, can someone with a caliper give me the exact measurement (in mm) for the height of the evolve truck base plate? I'd estimate no more than 5mm or so but would like to have the exact measurements if possible. Thanks guys,

thanks for the photo egzplicit, but I was hoping for an exact measurement with a caliper instrument. I'm planning to 3D print an add-on fixture for LED lights but I forgot to bring the trucks with me lol..
But thanks again for the effort and attempt to help!! :D
