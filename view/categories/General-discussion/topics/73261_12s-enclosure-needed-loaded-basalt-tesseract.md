Hello, I am going to do a my first build soon and have a good idea of the parts that I need. 

So far I have bought some hummie v4's, a nano x, and a focbox unity. I am going to buy a 12s2p battery from Miami Electric boards and their 12s bms and charger. For the deck I am going to be using the Loaded basalt tesseract because it has some flex, really good vibration dampening, for the crappy roads near my house, and a kicktail. I was thinking about doing a split enclosure because of the boards slight flex but im not really sure. If I do go with a split enclosure I can 3d print a esc enclosure. I am thinking about buying a eBoosted 12s vanguard enclosure but am not sure how good the weather seal would be because of the w concave on the tesseract. Any suggestions for the battery enclosure? Thank you guys so much for being so helpful and answering all if my questions! 
Doug
