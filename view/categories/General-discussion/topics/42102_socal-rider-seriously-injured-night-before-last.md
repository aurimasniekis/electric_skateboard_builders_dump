Derek aka @bigboytoys was seriously injured in a crash this week. I don't know anything other than he is in ICU. 

His family has chosen to remain silent while they focus on him. Hard for me to sit and do nothing so I'll write this.

You're on my mind. I can't do anything else. Get better Brother.
If you, or anyone in your family need anything. Please let me know what I can do to help.

Wow, sorry to hear about this. I hope we can hear what happened if it's related to electric skating and learn from it at least, he's a shredder and gets out there and rides for real hopefully he didn't discover a limit unprepared, let's all remember to keep advocating for helmet use and the importance of safety with these things, they are the most dangerous form of skating there is..it pays to be cautious and safe, and get well soon @bigboytoys , take care of yourself, I still want to do a cross country race with you man!

Holly shit, that's a terrible news, I was just exchanging PMs and I wondered why he didn't reply, I know now. 

If he is in ICU then the hit must have been pretty bad, his boards is extremely powerful I really hope he is ok, but thus really sucks as a community, this machines are getting stronger and stronger everytime increasing the inherent risk of fatality.

We need to start to increase the protection as well, what really makes it more difficult is that speed is addicting, we should all consider increase safety specially on high powered boards

This is awful...he was one of the helpful ones here...contributed much he did. @psychotiller can we get together something nice like some flowers and a gift basket? Maybe a card digitally signed by all of us here...i think that would be a really nice gesture...maybe do it like a group buy?

Does Derek have a full face helmet? I‚Äôve only seen him ride with that normal skate helmet loosely on his head. We should chip in and get him one as a get well üéÅ I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôs the largest size they come

We should stop speculating on the accident till we know what's up, he could have fallen down a flight of stairs or been beat-up by a girl, no one knows yet..but if it was an eskate wipe-out, let him teach the lesson, he'll know it best..

regardless, we should all be padded the hell up if you're sustaining speed above 20mph thru urban settings.

I met @BigBoyToys a little while ago and felt like we were already long time friends. He's a great presence in our community. Always pushing the limits of riding and building ultimate skateboards. Rode with him this Christmas Eve and could barely keep up and celebrated at a party afterwords. Planned a long +50 mile ride for yesterday, got a text from mutual friend that he was in a very bad skateboard accident the night before. I don't know the details of how he went down. He suffered a bad head injury. It is very serious and I hope he gets better

I was in a bad wreck when I was younger (hit by a mini van on my bike) and the skate style helmet saved my life....they said that even a foam bike helmet probably would have equated to brain damage

Best of luck @BigBoyToys. I don't care whether or not you were wearing a helmet when you went down... all I care about is that you get better. For those who want to talk helmet safety, move it to another thread.

Damn. How can I support from Paris ? What do you all think to send him few bucks to show our support, so he can buy additional gear or a new helmet or a good bottle of champagne or wine ? I just opened a leechi donation platform. Feel free to support 

https://www.leetchi.com/fr/Cagnotte/28154101/575f5de6

I've been using leechi in the past, but if you prefer to setup another fund raising, I'm down with it too.

I haven't known Derek that long. But I agree with Tito that since our very first meet up I felt like we were family. I posted this to let you guys know. Not to start a helmet safety thread. 

Updates on his status will be shared here when his family feels like sharing.

i am in other forums that have a pretty high fatality rate among members and these threads tend to digress into safety and conjecture of blame/responsiblity.

PT is right, let's please not go down that path...

@BigBoyToys Sorry to hear, wish you the best recovery. If this was eskate related, take it easy out there. It's a dangerous world. We take it for granted sometimes and it takes a bad crash to remember that we are always hanging on the edge to serious injury or death.

Oh my...wow. This is some of the worst news I have heard in a while. I hope the best for his family at this point...just shocked honestly. We have all had our fair share of injuries (i know I have) but this is next level. I still can't believe this happened

I'm so sorry for you @Jess and Derek's family. The few times I chated with him were great, I kinda felt close  because he's a big dude too (though bigger muscles).

Can't say anything because there are no words able to make up for your loss. My prayers accompany you all, and if I don't know your story, maybe you should try and meet his family again.

Just so sad, sorry for your loss @Jess, try and reconsider to go to the funeral so as to not add a regret.

I'm new here although it was obvious Derek was a loved and respected member here who epitomised the spirit of esk8. 

Although to some this may seem a somewhat spurious, quasi-illegal hobby, there are many of us who think this whole esk8 'thing' is on the forefront of something important; a new means of mass-transport and sporting endevour - we all want to fly, we are a merry band of outcasts & in Derek was a beacon of pushing the limits of what is possible, his contributions will be remembered.

fly on Derek

Wishing you the best

I'm sorry sorry to hear this, I can't begin to imagine what you and his family are going through. He was a great guy and a much loved member of this community. He will be sorely missed.

We can only hope he is up there esk8ing amongst the clouds... :pensive:

I'm another one who never met him, I don't think I ever even sent or received any posts from him. He was always there though, he had quite a presence about him on the forum. He always struck me as one of those guys who'll befriend anyone within minutes. He had all these great ideas and wanted everyone to be as excited about this hobby as him.

We're all going to miss you terribly Derek.

Wow, this is horrible news. Was really hoping to hear he pulled through. He had some of the craziest powerful builds and was always happily giving out suggestions and comparisons for everyone else that couldn't get them as fast as him. He's given me a bunch of advice as well, even on my little setup. He's even offered to help me out with parts if I paid shipping. Never took him up on the offer though.

Sorry for your loss and he will be greatly missed through this community. I remember when everyone was so excited about trying to get the new carvons and he had already been testing them on his board. He definitely threw himself into the innovation of this sport(?). 

I never met him in person but he was so helpful to the esk8 community. He never acted like he was above anyone even though he always had the best stuff. He didn't keep all the juicy exclusive info to himself, he happily shared his experiences to help everyone else with their future setups. He always joked about being a big guy. I remember someone asked how he had so many nice boards and he said it was because he had a good job and no kids lol. He seemed to have a fun life and played hard. 

RIP @BigBoyToys

Friends, it is with a sad heart that I am writing to share this update. We received confirmation that Derek passed away as a result of his injuries.

We will keep these threads closed for now, until have approval of the family to disclose additional detail.

Please keep his family in your thoughts, and rest on each other for support in this difficult time. 

Above all, celebrate the wonderful person that Derek was, and bring with you the best of his good energy into all that you do.
