As always: In stock and ready to ship. 200A is the VESC 75/300 class. The VESC 6 plus is good for 80A and 100A if cooled properly. Today the office is empty: Mayday

Low and behold royal mail is showing the item as ready for delivery, now i wait with baited breath to see if it turns up, if i had more to spend id be dealing with trampa. Straight talking and it does what it says on the tin.
