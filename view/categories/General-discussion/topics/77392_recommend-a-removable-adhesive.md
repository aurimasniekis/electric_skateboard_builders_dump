Any recommendations for removable adhesives?

I have some LiPos I want to hold down in one of the WowGo metal enclosures, but hot glue isn't sticking, velcro is too thick, and epoxy is too permanent. Anyone have a good alternative, removable solution?

If you can't use velcro then whatever you use will not be easily removable.  A good 3m double sided tape will work or if you can wait for it to cure then a neutral cure silicon.  Easier to remove the tape than the silicon but you can get it off again using a thin bladed knife.  Do it in small blobs and the removal won't be too problematic.  Are you talking remove to charge or remove when they need replacing?

@pat.speed it always seems like we're optimizing for similar things and arriving at similar designs hah!

@dareno most of the 3m tapes I have experience with arent much thinner than velcro, do you know of any that aren't ~2mm, padded, foamy tapes?

Mate I can go to bunnings and buy a 3m tape that is black and about 1.5mm thick.  Sticks like shit to a blanket.  Go on the 3m site and try to find it.  Not as vibration proof but it does give some protection.  @pat.speed your fine mate just go to bunnings.  I use it on my rc cars for the electronics and it holds well.

It needs to be easily removable, it’s for a swAppable pack
