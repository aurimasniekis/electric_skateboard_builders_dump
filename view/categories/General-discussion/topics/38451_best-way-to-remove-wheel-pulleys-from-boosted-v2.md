Hi eSk8ers! 

  I have a couple of eBoards, a Meepo I scrapped the deck on and replaced with a Loaded Dervish and a Boosted Dual V2 I am modding. 

  I picked up the Ollin Popoca wheels and picked up an additional set of Boosted wheels. I would like to remove the pulleys from the wheels and mount the Popoca's on them. 

  Is there a great way to remove the pulley's from the boosted wheels without damaging anything?

Thanks in advance! 

(and yes, I searched first :-) )

Just use a large flat head screwdriver and put it in between the pulley and the wheel and pry up.  Just do a little bit then rotate a smidge, pry a little, rotate a smidge, pry a little... Eventually the pulley will come off the wheel.

This is an easy mod you can do if you want to use your motor guards in conjunction with the popocas.
