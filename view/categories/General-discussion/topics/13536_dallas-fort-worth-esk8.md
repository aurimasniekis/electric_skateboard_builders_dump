Last minute decided not to bring my esk8 on Thanksgiving trip given airport hassles for 5 days. Anyone know of a shop or someone interested in renting an esk8 in Fort Worth area for a few days over Thanksgiving. Never seen that before, but thought I would ask sitting at NYC airport lol.

I'm here, @XvDarkVAngelvX, @Jedi and along with few others. I'm sure one of them would be interested.

If you are interested in renting my build, PM me.

Make sure you agree on terms in case of part failure, crashing, liability in general. Just going to try and save you a headache.

Very nice. I live in the village at 75 and lovers, so I'm quite close to white rock. My board is still very firmly in the beta phase as things keep on coming loose, but I'd definitely be down to meet at white rock ale house one day and then cruise around the lake :smile:

@mason @Jedi  My board will officially be ready this weekend. I know we have quite a bit of rain in the forecast coming up over the next ten days, but once it clears/warms up I'm definitely down to meet up around white rock if yall two (and any one else!) are interested

Ha ya I have been talking to Jedi, we might just aim for another weekend. My board is MIA until Monday as of now anyway due to some parts that came in yesterday not working correctly.

I'll be out of town next weekend, maybe we can try for the weekend after that.

You would have more luck here or on reddit honestly. The Club forum has very few members and 95% are Raptor 2 owners or people getting production updates on the Raptor 2.

I just didn't want to keep posting here and someone say this isn't a group ride forum....

Well it should be. Or at least have a section of the forum for that imo.

How's Texas? I'm thinking of getting out of Miami my self although I finally have a little crew going on down here.

It's great, some of the Dallas streets can be pretty rough on the wheels though. We have some great parks with hills around the metroplex that are fun with nice concrete paths.

Agreed it should still be a section on the site...

Texas is pretty chill. Haven't really been here long enough but where I live I can't use the boards as much as before. Everything is too far and mostly need to drive.

Hopefully, I'll head back to Miami for a bit and get on a group ride with you.

Hey all, haven't been on the boards for a minute but am still riding the board. Jedi and I have met up a couple of times near White Rock and have had some good rides together. I have a new trail that I think you guys should all check out: Lake Highlands Trail; it's near Skillman and Walnut Hill. Easily my favorite trail that I've ridden in the city so far. It's pretty much a racetrack for eboards.  I have been trying to get Jedi out there; hoping to meet him out there sometime later this week. If anyone is interested, shoot me a DM and I'll send you my number. Probably going to aim for 7:30-830pm as it'll be cooler by then. @oriol360 @Dyspro @mason

I'm familiar with that area, I work fairly close to there. I'm about to head out to SFO but next week when I'm back that'd be fun.
