So I got problems with my motor about a month ago now. I started the RMA process on the Enertion site 4th of July. In the beginning of this week (18th) it was still pending so I sent an email out monday that has not yet been responded to (it has been 18 days since my initial contact).

I know @onloop and the others over at Enertion have a lot on their plate at the moment but this response time is starting to become unacceptable and my feeling when reading about support errands with Enertion is that most people get very good help which makes me feel my case has gotten lost or something. I mean @onloop even came to the thread where me and another user described our problems but I get zero response when opening RMA or emailing.

What is your experience, does it usually take time or what is going on?

(Absolutely not aiming to do any badmouthing about Enertion. I have bought lots of things and I am very pleased over all but this support time is making it hard to not say something bad)

I guess it is a bit of luck. @onloop told that they get daily about 150 mails...some important ones some less important ones.

I had much luck! I had to buy new caps for my delivered VESCs. I sent the bill to enertion and it was paid within 1 day :O

Thanks a lot for the will to help the costumer @onloop!

Usually get a reply within 48hrs except for weekends which is understandable.
Nothing but great costumer service for me, unfortunate delays in getting stuff during the expansion, but still great communication.

Thanks for the response. 

Problem is the following described in this thread (not my thread but I added a picture there): http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/raptor-dual-one-motor-starts-breaking-short-in-windings-solution-found/4868/26

I have thought about trying to fix it myself but not sure I will succeed and have therefore not wanted to tamper with it before talking with support.

Edit: As you can see the wires are touching and have shorted out/gone black there. Board slams on breaks when riding so have not dared to ride since for the sake of myself and not screwing the VESC up.

The fix is for this issue is fairly quick, need to get more heat shrink tube and cover these exposed lengths of copper wire inside the motor, that will fix the problem. If you have epoxy you could also glue the wires in place to prevent the vibrations.

to open the motor you only need to remove one circlip. so you will need circlip pliers. You will also need some heat shrink tube.

Shrink tube is easy to find, something like this pack is a good idea

I am in Sweden.

I have some shrink tube somewhere at home so could maybe try and fix it. 

On a more positive note, the other parts (remote, mount kit, VESC and wheels) are really good :ok_hand:

So I opened up the motor just now and other from the part that it's impossible to move the stator from the rest of the motor it's all good...

I might still be able to fix it, but it'll take time and honestly I have more fun things to do in my tiny amounts of spare time. I feel like I've bought a faulty crap china product for shitloads of money. Like who thought it was a good idea the cables could move around freely and not be isolated?!

Sending it around Europe is probably useless, it'd be cheaper to buy another motor off hobbyking and throw this crap out in the yard for insects to live in.

@massy and @Haick - I understand your frustration.  But even with good QC - things get past testing.  I'm expecting those motors spun and passed, but may not last long w/ wear.  MTBF is a bitch and applies to all electronics.

I've always found Enertion support to be really fast and they've gone the extra mile a few times getting things to me quickly.

If you have the disposable $ to chuck them out the window - i'd give them to another e-boarder here to fix and use...  no need to be wasteful.  I know this is you venting your frustration, but give them (enertion) a chance to help and fix.

If you don't want to take a minute or two to fix a small issue (easily done w/ steps given) - perhaps DIY isn't for you?  .  And if that quick fix doesn't work - i trust they will make it right.

And if DIY isn't for you - there's always the new Boosted coming out you could look at getting

I hear you loud and clear and feel the same for the most part. 

DIY is most definately for me, that said however doesn't mean I necessarily enjoy spending hours and buying tools for the specific cause of repairing a part I bought assembled and ready to go. This is most certainly not a few minutes task (if you know how to do this in minutes, please explain).

I understand wear and tear is a thing but if this is a problem with many motors it will eventually come back and kick Enertion in the ass as well when people get thrown off, lots of motors need to be recalled etc, etc. The cables are moving freely like 5-10cm at the motor entrance for christ sake, if these doesn't move to short the thing out eventually I'd say you're incredibly lucky. It's just not viable in the long run or for the sake of peoples safety in a commercial product like the Raptor.

And it's not like I've worn this one out for long time. Got the motor in Feb/March, built the board, tested in April/May. Got everything up and running by the end of May. Rode 20 km a few times and "this motor is now fucked and tried to kill me several times because the factory doesn't know how to isolate a cable".

I have put the thing in the freezer (which should help according to...folks?) and will try to get the stator off again tomorrow (which by the way is not a few minutes work. Especially if you don't have an arsenal of tools). Now however: sleep time.

It depends on your setup (you could have strained the motor), but from my point of view it looks like Enertion is not being professional with customer support. We don't know the real cause of the problem, but let's put that aside for a moment. You contact the company that sold you the product you're having trouble with not so long after buying it and you get no reply in two weeks - that's bad customer care. Even worse is this: "because we have a lot on our plate" and "things at Enertion HQ have been very crazy for last two months" (which onloop continually says everywhere). Why the big 'F' should that concern me after buying a product for 150-200 bucks? And I'm not even saying that the product is bad (we don't know), but after a paying customer asks something - you should answer fast, your reputation is at stake.

PS: I don't know the whole story and I didn't buy anything from Enertion myself, but i'm seeing a lot of things like this from others lately. @onloop, if you run a business, be professional about customer support. Excuses don't cut it!

PPS: I think i've cut Enertion too much slack. If several people ahre having the came problem, it can really be the provider's fault. Also answering something like "you can fix it yourself" instead of "I'm sorry we lost your email, please do so an so..." feels cheap.

[/quote]

please don't remove the stator, all you need is a circlip plier, if you don't have that use normal pliers but you might then need a new circlip.

otherwise, we need to get the motor sent half-way across the globe, back to Australia, I'll take the circlip off & I'll put the shrink tube on the wires, then i ll send the motor back across the globe.

this will take around 2-4 weeks. cost probably $200 in shipping fees.

happy to offer that if you can't work it out.

please note, I am not trying to be a dick, i am just trying to save time & money by giving you advice on how to fix it yourself.

Poor thing, Did I hurt your feelings?
Thing is I never meant to, you're not mature enough to run a worldwide business if you take everything as a personal offence.
Learn to take constructive criticism (especially if your products are not the best, which you will not admit) and stop making excuses. Good enterpreneurs don't whine about how hard their life or business is.

PS: I do run en escape room business for two years, as I've mentioned in other thread. This business is the reason I tell you to ante up customer support, I've gone through this already.

I should have been more fair. Jason from enertion has been incredibly helpful every step of the way for each and every question I've asked. In fact, that's why I messaged him directly first. I don't have a problem having to desolder each bullet connector after already pulling the motor apart just to shrink wrap the motor wires that should have already been heat shrinked and not exposed from the manufacturer. It's such a small cost savings and a huge corner to cut on a part that clearly is bound to fail very fast! I don't think this at all seems unreasonable. I still 100% support enertion and understand this could be a problem with growing pains. But I find it hard to justify something that's so easy and cheap to do right in the manufacturing process that clearly was a way of cutting corners. I'm fully aware Enertion doesn't build the motors himself so if I was him I'd either have the manufacturer fix it, or find a new motor manufacturer who won't cut the smallest of corners. Or obviously add the wire coverings himself. I don't regret the purchases I've made at all. I am satisfied with everything I've bought from enertion. However, this one just seems like such an obvious no brainier that could have been so easily fixed.

yes, you did hurt my feelings.... try to keep your negative bullshit to yourself, i am not a big corporation, i am just a dude in a garage.... try to remember that, also try to remember I am a human with feelings like anyone else on here.

At the end of the day, this is my business & I decide what I say & what i do, if you don't like it that's your problem.

It seems fairly obvious that paying around $200 in freight (and more import taxes) to return a motor to Australia to install heat tube & post it back overseas is extremely wasteful, slow, bad for the environment and not in the best interest of the customer.

of course if they cannot fix it themselves i will offer additional steps to resolve the problem, there really is no limit to what i will consider, but first we need to try the quick & easy solutions first. That's fairly standard in the service industry.

I know it all, but when a customer comes to me and says something along the lines of "your room is not logical", I tell him: "Oh, sorry, please tell me what you would like us to change so we could be better for you". Then he tells me, I listen to him with a smile, thank him for the "input" and go on with my life. The room doesn't need to be perfect (motors don't either), but the customer experience is heavily based on how he is treated. If I told him: "Well, you can say all you want, we built it, so only we can make judge logic", he will go telling his friends how rude I was and even if the room is really good, it wouldn't matter anymore neither for him nor for his friends.
I don't think low of you, I just think there's a thing or two you need to improve.

PS: Now I get why the world sees russians and ukrainians as brutal, we don't whine because our life is hard from the young age.

PPS: I can whine too, but not in front of the customers.

@MidnightOne I have no fucking idea what business you are running, something to do with scary rooms.?...

but let's say you expand rapidly & have your scary room business setup in Australia, then one of your clients complains that they don't like this room because the door doesn't open properly & that people couldn't escape when they got scared, what would you do?

1. Fly to Australia yourself to fix the door?
2. Ship the entire room back to your country to fix it? 
3. Ask if the person who found the problem would be willing to fix it?
4. Find someone in Australia to fix it?
5. Close your business in Australia?

Exactly. The only thing you can do is choose how you react. And if you react the right way, they'll stop.

Alright, those "some day you'll understand" statements parents tell their children are true, you know. Best peace of advice: When you think someone picks at you, first calm down, and then analyze the situation. 
But hey, you're in charge of your life, why listen to people? Make your own mistakes.

Whoah, this thread went crazy.. Chill out folks.

But in all honesty how in the world am i supposed to isolate these cables with shrink tube properly without getting the stator off? Genuinely curious because I cannot see how in the world that would happen when the metal casing is in the way. I have already separated the two metal parts so the stator is exposed. @onloop (or someone else), care to explain?

1. cut off the shrink tube the goes around the three wires
2. then push the 3 phase wires back through the hole that they exit from, do it one at a time.
3. then you can unravel the wire & insulate the excess amount.
4. you might also decide to fix the wires in place with some epoxy to prevent movement.

this should resolve the issue & everything will work perfectly again.

I will happily compensate for your time & materials. 

Otherwise, we will arrange to send it to someone closer to you who can do this for you.

Alternatively sending back to Australia is an option but probably the last resort.

[quote="Haick, post:11, topic:6474"]
This is clearly something that's an issue on all of the motors and should be fixed before these are sent to customers.
[/quote]

**It is not a problem with all motors, we sell hundreds of R-SPEC motors and there have probably been about 20 reports of this issue, the factory has been notified about the problem and it has been rectified in all the latest batches.**

The issue is related to an excess of phase wire that has been wrapped inside the motor can, these wires rub together & the polyurethane insulation wears down, if this occurs and two opposing strands of phase wire short together it causes the motor to heat & potentially lock the motor up similar to applying the brakes during normal riding.


If anyone believes they have loose wires they should email support@enertionboards.com for further instructions.

Had the same problem (RSpec from order #2653, end of March), the fix took me ~30 min, two wires had some strands broken, I left them as they were, shrink-wrapped everything and it doesn't fail vesc motor detection anymore! 

I was a bit worried of breaking the motor (pulling the stator out from the magnet requires some force :D ) but everything went ok and at the end the whole operation was not a big deal, at least I looked into a motor and learned something new ^^ but I imagine that for some people it can be tricky to do it... you have to desolder and resolder the connectors, reposition the wires as they were before, put the shrink tube that hold the three wires together correctly (needs to go inside a little bit so that when you shrink it the wires won't move independently anymore) etc...

before:

Had the same thing, also fixed it with shrink tube, didnt even think about contacting enertion, its just wear & tear, and mostly my fault too, because the way I set the exit wires up, they kept wiggling on the motor exit. you always need to have them very loose OR directly tied to the mount or truck before they go anywhere else.

Good job!... however It is better if you mount the motor with the wires coming out the side nearest the trucks baseplate. 

The way you have it now put more strain on the wires.

Damn. I wish I had been informed about this common problem before this happened:

WARNING to everyone who has bought an r-spec recently. This issue has not been solved yet...

I shorted my non-rspec and went down at at least 25mph.  Every motor put on a skateboard should be potted at the phase wires or something.

Heat is a big problem if you pot the wires.

I don't think necessarily.   Talking top tech stuff.  Tesla car motors are potted

Even a conformail coating, as they call it , of something strong would be nice.  

I still think if it's done right it could be a help.

I tried it with some pretty good stuff and it was a failure as far as transferring heat.  Gets hotter by ten to twenty f.   But that was about half an inch thick.  Maybe thinner would be good and a small concession to safety and confidence in the ride

I don't really hear many people have issues with shorted cables (besides a couple on the r spec when it had a design flaw). Not sure the benefit would outweigh the additional heat from potting.

Other than shorting the windings there aren't many ways I see a motor dying.  Eventually the enamel deteriorates and that's a short, or friction rubs the enamel off and that's probably much more common.  Or u can break a magnet or it come loose but that's rare.   A potted motor and potted magnets, rarely rarely done, I'd prefer it even if it's a bit hotter.   If there was some good screening too then I'd have peace of mind.  Motor failure seems to be instant ejection

but how much friction is there in the motor? The copper shouldn't really move at all. the thing that moves the most are the phase wires when fiddling around with them or turning on a skateboard.

I had to fix 2 r-spec's on my board recently (bought in dec '15) I hit a bump and they both just "died" right there and then. Doesnt seem to take much to knock them out, but with new heatshrink on them they're running great again.

Well I've also had the same problem with my rspec. After just going through the steps of trouble shooting and repairing the problem I can safely say the following:

The reason for this shorting is due to insufficient insulation/separation of the phase wires in the factory.  Heat shrink only protects the first 30mm and on mine you can clearly see where the wires cross during the finishing wraps in the factory. 

The wires are wrapped well but somewhat loosely inside the cage, so, after about 80 miles the wires have moved into in enough to make full contact with each other. This isn't a result of wear and tear or improper routing of the wires. There is a small section of pavement that was rough right before the first short happened so imagine it rattled in place to make the contact. 

I think I've got this bad boy all sorted now and will add some epoxy to help hold them in place.<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/2/2/227361eb874f6ad292c6acd2992ab9a6c6cd67cd.JPG" width="375" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/f/a/fa0c1c0e45d254e456fb4a5cb43e278d42df0490.JPG" width="375" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/0/9/09f58ba0c1ab05065a09e3f02d134433b2c60528.JPG" width="375" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/c/4/c4a8c1f9153a1a3ec8db527c03e35666f720d80d.JPG" width="375" height="500">

Does almost every RSPEC have this flaw or have they been fixed after a certain order number? I'm planning on buying a used one, is there anyway to see if I should take it apart and insulate the phase wires or not?

Yes, they still have this problem no matter what Jason says. You should definitely insulate them asap or risk injury. You might be able to see if they are properly insulated without taking the motor apart. Personally I would recommend taking it apart anyways and really try to get it properly done.

:disappointed:

Are you guys just heat shrinking the exposed phases wires inside the motor?

That's what I did and it seemed to work. But I haven't done proper testing yet because there is about 1m of snow outside. :grin: . I guess it would be better if you secure the wires in place with hotglue also.

We now believe there were 100 in that batch that may have excess wires inside the barrel. The problem is most commonly appearing if there is lots of movement occurring with the wires when the trucks pivot during turning. A sturdy cable restraint can also prevent the problem.

The recommended fix is super quick. 

1. Remove one circlip on shaft.
2. Carefully remove the barrel.
3. Unwind/unravel the phase leads.
4. Cover the excess motor wires with tube insulation.
5. Wrap wires back into position.
6. Install barrel and circlip.

One of my motors just died after an 8km ride yesterday. I have one of the first batch Raptors #1350. Only about 200-300km on it so still pretty new. Crashed at full speed, big rock I did not see threw me, which put me off of riding for a while.
Thanks everyone for your posts and pics. I will be disassembling and if it is the same issue I will also video it so it will be up for all to see.
