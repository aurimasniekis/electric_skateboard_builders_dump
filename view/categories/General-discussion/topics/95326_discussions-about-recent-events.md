He's left before.  He might just need a brake. 
I doubt we've seen the last of him.

Look at it this way, we can view this as a clean slate and we have options between two forums for one great community. We're all very obviously drawn together by our shared passion and interest in this sport, regardless of venue.

Personally I know where I'll be focusing my efforts, but I've never been in support of pressuring anyone to choose. Variety and choices are a good thing.

@mmaner maybe just close this?

Um, well... To put it simply

Jason(onloop) is a manchild

Some criticized him, while others posted phallic-themed pictures

4 people got banned, and as a people of esk8(-not of the Jason Henchmen Fanclub), we demand justice. 

Anyways, you should check out https://forum. , new posts may be slow but no angry overlords

Hm but splitting knowledge and resources between two forums will have a negative impact on the community. Now that he's gone. (And for as long as he remains gone) I say we stay here.

Is he the sole owner? Seems like if he can just leave then he isn't critical to this forums continued function

I already have an account on the other forum.

That's not entirely true. If you look at other enthusiasts community's most of them actually do have more than one site. Our community is just really small still.

Do the tiniest bit of research and you will find this is just round three of the same old shit. Jason has done this before, "removed" himself just to slink back in and fire up the drama cannon.

On this site you are censored, continuously under threat of Jason returning to do it all over again... again.... and unable to speak your mind on the matter at all.

**The DIY community needs a clean break from Jason Potter and Enertion. It's really that simple.**

During this Drama:

* Several founding members of this forum were banned or threatened with banning for simply disagreeing with events
* Several founding members of this forum were demoted to non member ranks or removed as admins - people who have moderated and grown this place for years
* Groups of friends were split for no reason at all other than one person's ego
* Emotions caused people who are normally stable to boil over and act ridiculously
* Very little DIY took place among our most prevalent members - the reason we are here
* Hard cold thruths about previous nonsense came out, like $1500 monthy fees demanded of non enertion vendors, website links being removed for other stores and many other things
* When questioned about returning the forum to the community Jason asked for $100 per member quoting 16k members. There are 14k members out of interest. He wanted a million dollars to give the DIY forum to the members who built it.
* Did Jason offer any evidence for all of this drama? No
* Did Jason apologize for demolishing our trust in this forum? No
* Did Jason leave under duress? Yes
* Can Jason just come back at any point? Yes
* Will Jason be back in a few months? Yes
* Are Jason's agents still in charge of this forum in his "absence"? Yes

His literal last act was to lie about threatening to ban LHB. You cannot trust a person who does this.

Everyone should make their own mind up but your choices are clear. You stay here and watch history repeat itself, yet again. Or you move to a DIY run forum where members choose their own path and help grow the DIY aspect of our little community. Paying for it ourselves and owning it as a community.

I've made my choice, it was easy, you should consider your options carefully ladies and gents. Vote for the company with your wallet, vote for the community by putting your content in the right place.

This will be my last post here and I will not purchase another Enertion product in the foreseeable future.

**GOD SPEED HOMIES, IT'S BEEN A BLAST!**

I won't debate any of @brenternet's comments, except the one above. With Jason's departure, I am currently the only admin of this forum (yikes!) and I am by no means an agent for anyone. I don't know how long this will last, but that's the state of things at the moment. The mods and leaders have not changed. I'll keep everyone posted as we figure out how to proceed.

He's done this before more than once, and even [banned himself before](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/breaking-news-onloop-is-leaving-the-forum/3252).  He will be back, and with a vengeance.  Plus, enertion itself doesn't seem rock-solid anyway.  If enertion falls, this forum falls silverfish-style.  The other forum is ***100% COMMUNITY-FUNDED*** as-of today.

It's a no-brainer, really.

We need to get the Enertion guys over to the other forum. Way too many of us uses their products. And having them respond on a public forum helps everyone.

If most of the active and helpful members leave this forum for the other Jason could have a financial gain by not having to pay for this one so it's a win win for him.

If you do migrate. I highly suggest you donate via LHB'S patron I'm only in for a measly $3 a month.

 Ugh I wish we could just "dump" this site's posts into an "archive" section on the new forum. I doubt this one will disappear soon but the thought makes me nervous as even I reference old threads for ideas or info that I know the OP's wont port over.. Also just registered over there!
