I can understand problems do arise in business that could cause delays but at least let me get a full refund so I can buy from someone else. Why should I have to pay 20% because they suck at running their business. It's theft and should be illegal.

I know it sucks but you'll learn in esk8 you shouldn't hold your breath on things that aren't readily available in stock. 
This kinda stuff happens. Often.  Even to the best of vendors. Plus if you look enertion has a history with pushing shipping dates back on vescs.  Even back when it was the focbox.  
Sorry dude

That refund charge is complete bollocks to be honest and breaks so many consumer laws its silly. 
Wouldn't be upheld in their own country so why should they get away with it selling overseas.  Every place that has ever tried to charge me a restocking or cancellation fee has never actually got away with it here.   Check your own consumer rights for wherever you are and then quote it to them.  Its not a custom built piece of kit that you have commissioned and then backed out of, its a mass produced product and as such you are well within your rights to return the item if it doesn't suit if you have the original receipt.  If you haven't even received it then obviously so.  Imagine if clothing stores did that?  With the amount that my wife takes back they wouldn't ever have to actually sell anything.  They'd be rich on all the 20 percents.

Australian company, Australian buyer, you could do it for fun and just state you want a return/refund, 20% restock? Hello Australian consumer agency inquiry 

The actual product is whammo, just teething a little maybes in the f/w 

Enertion released a mailshot today about it, they need to up their game on either QA or bench f/w release testing

True stuff. the product is good and I have absolute faith in it down to how the focbox works.  20% though seriously?   

Tell you what guys lets tell everyone that if they want to cancel it will cost them 20%

All I‚Äôm saying is it would only take one email to rectify this slightly illegal practice.

but in order for the Australian stazi to get involved, the buyer has to be Australian as well otherwise no care by Australian authorities

It‚Äôs really shitty practice in light of unexplained ‚Äòdelays‚Äô 2nd season running. Things happen outside of your control but punishing buyers on top of them missing their build window for summer? 
Deciding that you no longer have an obligation to inform waiting buyers that 3 months is 6-7 months now and tough, deciding that the ordered products are no available and not really announce it, basically troll your customer base because you don‚Äôt want to take one for the team again. ü§îüßê

Let me tell you the boss crying was the only payback last year, more tears required

Good points well made and far more eloquently than I it would seem.   Think I've been over here too long.  
@mojoo999  If you really want a full refund then site the consumer law in an email as Alan has suggested but to be honest a working unity is what you really need.  It will be a market leader and of this I am sure.  Too many smart guys are working to make this a reality.  One not so smart guy is working to make it a failure.

Things always take longer then you expect. Just how business works with china. With hummie, a lot of the time was in figured out how to assemble the motors. There is not manual for this lol. When you go to china and have other's do your work though, you can get things done in a reasonable amount of time.

Idk what the problem is, but this same type of thread has been created for 4 years now, over and over again, on basically every product they have released since opening this forum. You'd think at some point, they would figure it out... Unless it's intentional to by time.

Well the unity has a lot of promise due to the very smart engineers who are working on it. The rest, eh... The moto of enertion is really about economics. I know for a fact he always has done at least a 4x markup on everything. So you can back track costs pretty easily. It's defiantly more about economic prices than the best quality. And with eskating, the margin of error is low.

Well it's very much about business. Jason manages everything, but he's not an engineer. He relys on other's and generally speaking, he's a master of marketing and finding talented people to engineer for him.

The focbox was because Charles and johnny put thousands of hours into the focbox. By the end, it was the only enertion product I feel comfortable buying, lol. I get why he killed it (so he can get pre orders for the unity), but it does put a lot of people in a bind.

There is more competition today than ever before for esc's... A lot of options.

This.  This is the crux.   we rely on these products to work because it could mean our health.  I personally have an issue trusting anything else because I know they work.  I'm confident that I won't hit the concrete at 40mph.  Unity should have had that level of trust before the focbox went bye bye.  Its a company built on sand.  No foundations.  Its a hobby for the little man at home to do while wifey is out there earning the money.  This is why we are the ones who are getting shafted.  Jeff sold his house to fund evolve.  went in hammer and tongs with his wife in partnership.  Foundations.

Australian consumer authorities protect Australians not Londoners

Your rights are pretty much whatever Enertion like so you talk to visa if you feel the delivery times are extremely misleading(for quite a few people = true) and ask for a chargeback

An Australian buyer has the option of really putting it to Enertion given they fall within jurisdiction, I would never ever part with 20%

They already have the updates but I'm guessing they want to proof these latest versions to ensure they are safe and thats a good thing.  Anyone who has issues have already been given the firmware revisions to good results.  To send out a product you know may have issues is negligent so delays in this respect is a good thing for the end user.  

Focbox had its fair share of bugs initially.  It went on to become the most trusted controller on the market.  I have absolutely no doubt in my mind this will be the same.  @Deodand is a clever chap.

It‚Äôs not clear that they have already exceeded the delivery times, could this be a case of impetuous behavior?

You don't handle it via enertion but the company behind whatever payment method you used. Alternatively, you may be covered by a consumer law such as CCPC. For you to figure out. AFAIK, if you deal with the EU you are bound by EU consumer laws for example, even though Enertion is Australian. Send Enertion a request to cancel the order with a clear reference to the law covering you. If you don't get a positive response, you may have legal insurance. If so, let them handle communication from there on out.

Since your order has now been delayed by only a few days, you may actually want to check how many days your order has to be delayed for any of the above to be valid, or if a delay is even needed to get a full reimbursement.

With some exceptions, the ESK8 industry basically ships products worldwide.
Most of the DIY ESK8 parts I make are from overseas.

Therefore, it is not very good to distribute defective products to the world.The warranty becomes difficult.
It is inevitable that companies will be cautious.
In the past EVOLVE has sold a number of defective products.
It had a number of life-threatening defects.
The early GT series was a murder machine.
EVOLVE continued minor updates over a year.
I think the delay in shipping is better than causing my own serious injury.
Product distribution will eventually become stable.
It will probably improve the quality more than the initial product.
The torque boards DD is also equipped with a temperature sensor from the 2nd batch and seems to improve the accuracy and quality of the axle shaft.
I think the ESK8 industry is an industry that can not be said that it is better to ship new development products earlier.

Dude I ordered mine March 19th... I'm also pretty pissed off about the whole situation. I ordered it to control my Torqueboards Direct Drive kit which also isn't here but that I understand. That was being advertised as a new product still underdevelopment and all that jazz. I knew I was in for the wait with the motors. But the Unity at the time I purchased it, was advertised like it was a tested, finished product ready for manufacturing and shipping. They keep telling me its 30 days out, I have asked 3 times now every 2 weeks, same answer.... 30 days. I was harassing Torqueboards for the same answers and they sent me a page long story explaining to me exactly whats happening. Do you think Enertion did that? Nope... 30 days. It's bull.

Hard lesson to learn but you should never pre-order a product that hasn't been released yet. I'll buy one when they're constantly available. You need to remember that these companies are looking to get a product out ASAP without doing all the testing. It's competition. A company could wait a couple months to do serious testing but then miss the market hype.

What has Enertion done? They've hyped their product; released it in time for summer; suckered everyone into buying it and then delayed delivery because, yano, it's not up to par.

The reason I‚Äôm lurking here on ESB is because I backed a mate x 205w+ bike last October with loads of broken delivery promises and bad luck (us/China tax wars) they‚Äôve finally set up camp in another country and I‚Äôm not expecting my bike until October (allowing for shipping times / internal delivery). I decided 5 months ago to look into this sport. 

In the time I‚Äôve waited, I‚Äôve saved enough to buy parts (second hand/some new) and am now building an electric mountain board and hopefully will get to ride it this summer in UK. 

Don‚Äôt think I will ever back a big ticket item again. Mate burnt my trust and have taken the excitement and joy out of buying the bike. 

It‚Äôs not even their first campaign, first was the same apparently. I guess this is what happens when you raise millions on a kick starter and have to scale up.. they‚Äôve still got my money and refunds have been  really slow.

Ordered mine in early May and, after repeated attempts at trying to contact them I've had no communication, no reply, just silence. NOT A SINGLE LINE. 

I have no idea of when/if I'm going to get my Unity. I've been an Enertion customer for a while and I was counting on this Unity to build a board in time for the Paris July meeting, but that wish is going down the drain now.

Really poor show @CarlCollins @onloop. Care to tell the peasants bankrolling you where my money or my Unity is, or when is it getting delivered? I'm effectively bankrolling your exploits with no benefit coming my way from MY money. 

How many of us are in this situation??

You can't believe how much I'm laughing now. 

A possible senario is that due to the bad batch of the wheels, renewing their process has cost a lot of money. They did not have this money so they had to sell many unity during pre-sale during the Easter sale. This did not yield enough money, as a result of which they again have a sale, but because some people have problems with unity, a large sale is not forthcoming. Probably there is no longer a budget for the people of the online support.

I'm not laughing, they have MY money.

It's at best irresponsible to conduct themselves in this way, at worst downright criminal. The fact is that no one knows what is happening apart from them. The fact that Enertion (@CarlCollins) has seen my message, been online to respond to other forum queries in the meantime, and not dedicate 5 mins to reply to my query is really bad form, and no amount of crap PR will cover for that.

The least they can do is communicate with their customers (e.g. the source of their income) and let us know what is happening and when are we getting our orders delivered. I don't care whether they have bad wheel batches or whatever rumors there may be, I care about my order and when it is going to be delivered.

This is not very good.
The user side including me may also have a cause of causing Unity's failure.
However, if we talk too much about the problem in the forum, everyone's willingness to buy will decline.
Evolution stops if no one buys a new development product.
I think this business is really difficult.

Haha, How long are you in this esk8 hobby?
Enertion is know for the delays off orders and bad communication...
I have friends who ordered almost a year ago wheels from enertion and still don't have them :sweat_smile:

Not necessarily, there are plenty of other companies that do their best to put a new product on the market. just like people from the esk8 community.  

Trampa is currently working on a new remote. But who knows, maybe they will release a dual vesc 6 next year. The evolution of this hobby is going very fast. When I see what happened in 3 years it is extreme. Everything used to be much more expensive and things often broke faster

That's the nature of business, fortunately or unfortunately. If Enertion can't deliver (be it because of bad/rushed product development, bad customer communication, etc), others will come to fill in the void.

Certainly evolution is too rapid.  I think that companies that are down front are quite disadvantageous.
As Torque boards DD was released after Carvon.
There are several other such examples.
Personally, I would like to support a company that produces new things.
However, there are many cases where it does not go well.

@Enertion I love you guys. Really kind that you blocked my business account on Instagram. 

I gave only this reaction to felonious_board.co. 

‚ÄúDid you ever read the esk8.builders forum? Jason was hiding topics if somebody was talking about the bad service off Enertion. 

The single Focbox was one off the best products they ever had produced. But the problems with the unity‚Äôs starts coming. I have a friend who has broken his shoulder due the bad firmware off the unity. But enertion told 3months long ‚Äúthere is no problem‚Äù until some weeks ago in there newsletter that it was fixed. (I am not sure if it is fixed fully). 

I have also some friends who ordered 11months ago some wheels. When they arrived there was a big wobble in the wheels. They send them a message about it. There reaction: ‚Äúthere is no problem with the wheels‚Äù. So they were willing to replace them. We said that before shipping they have to check the wobble. They said the wheels were fine. When we received those, you can already guess: wobble. 

You can easy see that the core was placed wrong in the urethane. I think 3months later in the newsletter: ‚ÄúWe have some problem with the wheels production‚Äù.  So my friend have shipped those wheels back. Now after +-10months they have still no wheels. 


There has been so much lied to me and my friends that they just can't take their company seriously anymore.  if they were established in europe, they would sit with me at the court.

One off the lies: yes you order is shipped. After 2 weeks you contact them. No the order is not shipped we have some problems in production. ‚Äú

JUST NOW found out that one of the 3.5mm bullets was soldered on backwards from the factory....

First of all it's not a lie, we aimed to ship the orders and we do shipped some but when we got information from the production team about some issues with the Unity, we pulled them back as they are only went through the warehouse to China Custom.
So it's not a lie but I guess you don't know the procedure so that's why you take it as a lie.

The thing is your company will never tell there is any problem. That whould be an insurance problem.

Yeah Menno's groupbuy, We are 6days left and then the order is 1 year old. 1 fucking year and still no wheels? Is that how it works? :face_with_monocle:

Yeah Is fine, let me check If I can find the whole chat history. First things I can find is this:

You had told 4 days before this convermation that the whole order was shipped and that you was only waiting on the tracking. After 4 days no tracking update we opened a converstation and then Mike told this ^ #lie1

Indeed you have replaced all the wheels, but you what do you think? That you can have a good ride on those wheels? https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/no-words-just-pictures-delete-words/2992/9105?u=pjotr47


Indeed you have placed him in queue for new wheels, but do you know how long we've been in this queue?

I will ask menno about the store credit. And also about some more evidence. BTW: it's okay to make mistakes,we are only humans, but just admit it honestly and don't always put it in the customer's shoes

It was not about the unity, because at this moment, I don't want to order one and then never know when I have it at home. (And BTW: I need to still to update the firmware on the unity to check out that DIGITAL antispark problem and not the switch problem)

It was about the wheels, you have clearly said: the order is shipped, we only wait for the tracking details from the shipping company. After 4 days and still no update from your side. We take contact with you about the order. And then you told: "we have not shipped the order".  The first thing you had to do, was contacting Menno and told him that there was a problem. The customer should not always contact you.



But to end this message with something positive, I really like the thing that your company take responsibility for producing new wheels. even though there was told there was no problem at all with those wheels :roll_eyes:

About the wheels, I already told Menno about it several times, I understand that wait time is too long for you guys and I deeply apologize for that but as I told above.
I actually replaced the wheels one time (all of them) but Menno and other group buy customers were not satisfied so we decided to wait for the new batch (which got delayed and we already informed about it to all of our customers here: https://us8.campaign-archive.com/?u=947da884abd94ce4872b0ec29&id=4ae3f4229b (May 31st, 2019)

About admitting things, we admit it from the beginning also after the inspection of the Menno's order. That's why we decided to replace them if we denied the issue how come we agreed to the replacement?

Also, I have reimbursed the taxes+shipping charges Menno paid twice.

I am not sure what do you mean by this but as per my knowledge, I clearly provided an update about it long ago that how this shipping thing works so I am pretty much sure that I haven't lied to anybody.

I need one example where I never admitted it, I always admit things but after investigating deeper and I think that's the right thing to do.

So in the end, We NEVER EVER denied any of our issues and haven't run away to somewhere. 
I know it's been quite a long time with the issue of the wheels but I would like to assure you guys that these issues will get sorted soon. :slight_smile:

You can say that as I tried my best to assist you over there.
Now we are waiting for your feedback.

PS: Even the wheels group buy was not officially announced by Enertion, this is something customer (Menno) decided to do on his own.

Again, We are always willing to fix all of the issues with all of our customers but

Hi Carl I see you active on the forum and you said in DM you would check on order last Monday but haven‚Äôt heard any thing thro DM all week. So back to saying it in public again. No partial refund or stor credit or update on December order. Still annoyed it‚Äôs taking so long and with the changes you needed to made to the order Due to stock issues as I end up paying more than others have payed for the same items.

@CarlCollins should my unity order ( ORDER #24246) be already marked shipped per the web front end?

As discussed here I am still waiting for the second Unity controller & this makes me uncomfortable insofar as the imminent shipping date advertised. I want to be in that shipment and not have to chase this up or remind Enertion that I am still owed one more Unity.

Maybe have the shipping status include a PARTIAL status, it‚Äôs not like it won‚Äôt get used again ever

For all which have missing shipments, I will arrange one and update their order statuses as well.
So, don't worry, I am trying to get your missing items shipped before end of this month by getting a small amount from the technical department.

@CarlCollins I know it fells like we having a go at you can I stress it‚Äôs not personal. and thanks for been one of the only people in the company that seems to actively doing things to try and sort this out even when the company you work for are making it hard for you. but I do think enertion are taking the piss and a hole lot more we talking out right lies and refused to do any thing when it‚Äôs policy appeared to be fob people off if it it take any effort to rectify a issue enetrion made. As well as the out right multiple lies iv been told and call entrain out in with evidence. It now to the point if I don‚Äôt kick up a fuss I be left at the back of the que again and expected to pay extra for the privilege. I‚Äôm still paying extra for the same items that enertion have messed up and I don‚Äôt see why I should pay more than the people who ordered later and all ready revived there items.

If there is any difference amount (like you paid more than the current price), I will refund that amount for ya! because it might happen due to the change in your order from 2 FOCBOXes to Single Unity.

That's exactly what's going on. Check the new interview with lhb at esk8 news. They plan to make smaller batches so that so much money isn't tied up in current production. All it takes is one major disaster to halt funding for the company. Let's hope they rectify it as planned.

Indeed. But I have responded this:

Yowdie Carl,

I have decided to keep the unity like it is. With broken antispark. I am going to use the e switch on my BMS. 

I have no desire to completely remove unity from my housing.  the bullets are glued and made waterproof. 

So I would be happy if we can close this case by only shipping those 2 remote‚Äôs.

Hey guys,
I also ordered this batch and got that mail, no shipping confirmation mail after all this time but i got a text from Fedex though so I guess it's the unity. Due to delivery in a few days, it's from Dubai (it could be something else but I really doubt it since I didn't order anything else). Am I the only one in this case ?
I'll keep you updated nonetheless.

Seems unlikely unless anyone else got a notification about a unity shipping. They would have sent an email saying it shipped. 
The picture posted with a bunch of packed unities seems to indicate they ship out in batches so it‚Äôs likely a bunch of people will get shipment notifications the same day. Or those are just prelabeled packages....

Also got texted by FedEx, seems like it is the Unity. Unfortunately stuck in customs :confused:

They ship this via a distributor or contractor that they can declare a lower value for customs I guess. My first Unity came with DHL Express and the information said it came from Qatar from DHGate.com. Was declared as 25usd and came through without paying customs. 
Unfortunately not this time as it seems.

I think we ended up splitting them shipped into two major batches shipping out. The first people are receiving now and a second half will be shipping out in a day or two so please hang on with us while we get the rest of them out the door. I think the new system we have implemented will allow us to avoid these long delays in the future. So sorry you guys had to deal with is, we can and will do better!

Hi Chase, you should get an email to notify you that shipping has occurred, which includes your tracking # and link.

Apologies to those that got their package without apparently receiving email first - our first priority is obviously getting these Unity out as quickly as we can to people, and there can be a delay until that tracking information is entered into our ecommerce system (which triggers the email to get sent.)

This shouldn't be a problem moving forward, however.

Thank you all for your patience - we'll be getting the remaining Unity from this batch over the next few days, and 90% of people waiting will get their Unity before the end of July.

Well as one of the people who thought I will never get it - when I got it I directly shipped it to the other end of europe to break the curse.

Also credit card company claims (at least in europe) can only be claimed within 8 weeks of the purchase and also the evidence must be overwhelming so that they will send you back your money (this might be different in the states).

But hey.. Enertion will only ship when:

Hi Chase (and others waiting for Unity),

We've got more Unity on the way very soon - a batch of Unity are headed to the US in bulk that will be dispatched to US customers (so once tracking is received next week, expect 1-3 day delivery).

We've also received word from our supplier that the next shipment of Unity is still 10-12 days away from being ready, as they are waiting on switches from their supplier >< This unfortunately only became apparent to us this week.

Although previously we'd anticipated 90% of customers receiving their Unity orders by the end of July, it's looking like 90% of pre-orders will be *shipped* before the end of July now. 

Lastly, the most positive news is that by the end of August, the aim is to be completely clear of Unity pre-orders, and in stock!! We've put a lot of effort into this, as we realise how much of a pain to everyone this has been - we're certainly not going to count our chickens before they're hatched either, but we want to let you guys (and gals) know that we're 100% committed and focused to achieving this.

You would be surprised how easily people tend to forget. This is all just history repeating itself, right down to the relayed reasons for delays. BTW, do you think  that the # of unites shown in the picture ready for shipping would have been enough to clear all orders? 

Even if there is a charge back by customers, the stock would be gone in no time. Hardly an issue for them. Just a means to get your money back, nothing more.

I hope those interested in their hardware read this and think twice before buying hot and trendy hardware from them. Wait for the item to be in stock and to be beta tested by the community. Highly likely that there will be a new revision with hard and or software fixes. Seems to be common for most hardware actually. I personally never purchase a revision 1.

When customers decide to do chargebacks due to the delayed shipments of products, the irony is that it only serves to worsen the situation that caused the decision in the first place. That's why we'd like to ask that customers stop doing (and recommending) chargebacks; every chargeback is guaranteed to cause more and more delays in our supply chain, and it puts all other customer orders at risk of longer delays.

But you guys have plenty of money, can't you just  give back what I gave you?

We wish it were that simple! If we are about to receive a batch of products to ship to customers, it's normal to have a substantial balance payment (50-70%) to make before the supplier releases the finished goods.

Although we reserve funds to allocate to these payments, chargebacks and refunds, along with their associated processing fees, means that we can be in the situation where our suppliers cannot get paid, and we have to delay shipping. We must then wait to sell enough product in order to pay said balances, which could take a week to several weeks.

Since there is no way to account for the severity of delays due to chargeback, it creates a vicious cycle that is currently preventing our products (Unity in particular) from being in stock for all customers to enjoy and purchase on demand.

Although you may be eligible for a refund pursuant to our terms and conditions, we really hope that you (and others) can find it within you to extend your patience that little while longer. We haven't lost sight of our mission to bring the best motor controller to the community - which despite all that has transpired, has always been our priority.

I met Jason in Paris and got to know first hand how passionate he is about e-skating, and how he sees it evolving in the future. Enertion has done a lot of good to the ecosystem and it's understandable you guys want to get the Unities to the customers as soon as possible. However, a better approach would probably be to give yourselves a bit of a time cushion above what your suppliers promise you so that customers don't get riled and you adequately manage expectations.

I just received the new email. I really hope I can get my hands on a Unity in August, as I'm just waiting for them to complete my second built...

The reason they don‚Äôt want us to do chargebacks is because the card company charges them a fee. If they just willingly gave us a full refund we wouldn't have to go that route. Maybe it holds up your money longer than if enertion refunded 80% immediately, but I‚Äôll survive knowing the card company will eventually return my money. I‚Äôll bet they don't give me false updates along the way either.

Sorry as there is almost one riding season ruined by the lack of transparency / communication in your company I can only offer this:

![grafik|690x460](upload://hPza9EibIgUo0f7z12TcxvXhxBF.jpeg) 

No Offense :smiley:
But like I mentioned many many (too many times) - the way your company tries to trick people into thinking things are different on the homepage with choosing certain words and writing the terms in a certain way and presenting themselves in a certain way to make fools out of your customers.

If someone did no research on Enertion before ordering (like me) one would have thought that Enertion is a big company that has a stock and makes quality parts in Australia. Saying Shipping dates are estimates "AFTER MARCH" and then arriving end of July might still not be a lie - but its just soo shady..

But I broke the curse and already received and then within two hours sold my unity before touching it.

You guys are for sure doing your best to keep the ship floating - but one thing is for sure - no more enertion for me (ever). It's just an awful customer experience to put it quite frankly :face_vomiting:

Been ghosting this thread for while. It's pretty sad that an awesome product like this gets a bad reputation due to production delays. 

I'm surprised by many of you who have not moved on. Just get a different Vesc. Once enertion is fully stocked w no backlog, then come back and purchase one. Sell the old one. 

Personally speaking, I would not ruin my summer or fun in general because of this.

That‚Äôs the plan. Honestly I would have gone flipsky months ago but then enertion pulled this 20% bullshit. I could definitely cut my losses and be fine, but it‚Äôs far more about principle at this point. I want all my money back whether it takes longer or not. It‚Äôs not my first chargeback and it‚Äôs really not that hard.

And they don‚Äôt need a business loan...that‚Äôs what we are

So this last communication from @adrianenertion has finally prompted me to open a dispute with my credit card company.  I've copy/pasted the entire message into the notes section of the dispute.

After all that ‚ÄûEnertion is lying!‚Äú Adrian gives a totally honest view of things. I do appreciate that a lot. We may not agree how Enertion runs its business but I think honesty/transparency is crucial for Enertion.

And they added paypal as an option - another step in the right direction. :+1:

The card company will want you to first ask them for a full refund in email. If they say they want to keep 20% or don‚Äôt respond they will likely approve the chargeback and fine Enertion. At least in the US.

FFS, latest delays due to "component shortage" now take my unity delivery back to the 3rd week of August. I received this last email only a few hours of a previous email stating that the Unity was going to be delivered by the end of July.

tbf, they didn't mention of which year. What a joke. Why not just use a random number generator for updates on dates???

Lol I have gone through this before with my Raptor 2 preorder, over promised and under delivered. The only good experience I had was with Bara but that's because he is one of us and understands us.

It's sad to see where they have gone from where they were before. 

I have my 2 unities and I will continue to use them because I do like them for many reasons but I sold my Raptor 2 out of pure dissatisfaction. I do miss the Raptor 1, despite all its problems it's a superior board to the Raptor 2.

Two emails in quick succession. One referring to small production delays (10-12 days) and the next pushing back to the end of August.

Piss poor. I'm fully expecting to have my unity in August... 2021.

Yeah seriously, charge back, buy flipsky, maybe swap it back when unities become "in stock" (probably by 2022)

Not sure why you're all just taking the hit being treated like trash.  Especially for some people where $200 is alot of money to them and don't have funds to buy a flipsky without a chargeback.

Hi Nativeijbroney22, 

Our apologies that we haven't gotten back to your email yet - we are experiencing an unusually high volume of enquiries right now. We are, however, improving the situation every day, and will get everyone attended to within the next few days. We thank you for your patience!

You should have received an email regarding your order, but in case you didn't, we upload them to the blog post as well ([here](https://www.enertionboards.com/pages/unity-shipments-resume/)) We've asked for final confirmation from our supplier, but Unity are due as per this schedule, which means they're due for shipping within the next 7 days or so.

Got ahold of them yesterday through the pm. As mad as I‚Äôve been about all this, it looks like they are trying to make things right. My biggest slap to the face is honesty the unrealistic ship times. Tell me a year if it‚Äôs a year and  I have no reason to complain. I‚Äôve just dealt with too many fraudulent esk8 companies to not try to learn from my past experiences.

Regardless, I felt better after my conversation with @adrianenertion and am gonna give this a few more days and see if this is the final push. I don‚Äôt know how many preorders I‚Äôll be doing from now on but at least this one has the chance to finally come through in the end.

Crossing my fingers. I loved the singles and I‚Äôd really love to see the same quality from the unity.

Hi @Jaydawg - we're extremely sorry that @CarlCollins hasn't been able to get back to your enquiry as of yet. We're currently experiencing much higher than usual volumes of incoming enquiries, so this has created a rather sizeable backlog of messages in our system.

Replied, I only received one of my two Unitys. Carl said he‚Äôd get it taken care of and that was 30 May.  
My order was for two, only one shipped but my status said both shipped (which it did not). Here is a picture of the weight of a single unity and what is on the shipping label. 

I‚Äôm not going to let you start thinking I received my full order when I did not.

Hi 370 - The information about your order is still the same as the email that you should have received on the 16th of July - We haven't sent a follow-up to this email, as we are expecting stock to arrive in the next day or two, so we can begin arranging the next bulk load of Unity to go out (yours included.).

If this changes (we'll be getting further confirmation today) at all, we'll send out a further notice to let you know via email, and update via our blog as well.

Thank you for your patience and understanding while we work to fulfil your order!

By the end of August, we'll have sent out any of the Unity orders that haven't been shipped over the next few days (shipments are due in the next 24-48 hrs to our forwarder for immediate dispatch). It'll also mark the first time in a while that we'll have an abundance of Unity stock - and we're aiming to keep it that way - so you guys and girls don't have to endure crazy waits for Unity, ever again. We do have the capacity to produce orders up to 5000 units per month too - we've got over 500 Unity in the production pipeline to be finished over the next 30 days, but we now have the capacity to ramp this volume up monthly as required so we can cater for demand at any given time.

Still rooting for you guys despite all the headache that has been caused not only in the last 8 months, but with the reputation you have all afforded yourself.  When it comes to motor controllers, you are the best game in town balancing cost, performance, size, etc.  But these delays are out of control.  You all make it appear as if you have zero say/control over the processes you've created/trips to China to make this all a reality (Enjoyed watching that series Jason and crew put together)... like you are at the mercy of the factory.

All aside, hope you guys are seeing the light at the end of the tunnel and can really nail down your supply chain.  Good luck to the company

So update from my end. My two unities are arriving Thursday. I feel kind of bad for being so aggressive with these the customer support agents. @adrianenertion  is obviously doing his best to fix the shit show that has developed with the unity releases. 

Not saying we are wrong to be upset, but it seems to be finally working out. What really pissed me off the most was the 20% refund fee and the email saying ‚Äúgood news you‚Äôll be getting it earlier than we had expected‚Äù. 

But lately I think Adrian is putting balls to the wall to make this right. 

I know there‚Äôs plenty of people out there that are still pissed and in the dark but I just wanted to share how mine ended up.

 The last several companies that sent me through this loop never even delivered. It‚Äôs been a rough road with lots of delays but at least the product finally showed. It seems to be a common issue with esk8 companies not meeting expected release dates. I really hope that this changes as the hobby develops.

call your credit/debit card and do a chargeback.

Or if u used paypal contact them.

This way they cannot keep the unlawful 10/15% admin charges and they end up with a $25 charge for being a bad merchant and getting charge backs‚Ä¶ HIT THEM WHERE IT HURTS AND DO A CHARGEBACK!!!

Do not waste your life trying to contact Enirtion then will lie to you and laugh behind your back that your an idiot for belieivng them

For whatever reason it can take up to a few days after the package is in route to get the tracking number. I was thinking mine hadn‚Äôt gone out and they told me this. I got the tracking number when it had already been traveling for a day. Went from Dubai, to Mumbai, to Italy, to the States. Then damn FedEx wouldn‚Äôt leave the package without a signature even though I created their online account and told them to leave it at the door. Ended up having to sign their label and leave it for the next day since FedEx comes when I couldn‚Äôt be around.

I received today last part - the wheels -  from banggod after 2.5 months - apart from unity

I don't want to brag @adrianenertion, but if there is anything you can do, please, give me some the info about order #26949. 

the summer is almost over, and I'd like to know if it is worth for me to get something else in the meantime

 I got the Fedex tracking number (788896561939) two days ago but it looks like only the label was created and the package hasn't been shipped out. Anyone experiencing the same thing? @adrianenertion

@adrianenertion I received an email 7 days ago saying that " **The Unity you've been waiting ever so patiently for are here finally, having arrived at our forwarder late last evening.**

We'll be arranging all of these to go out today" 

Is this another demonstration of Enertion's poor client management skills or is there actually an Unity being delivered for me? Seven days is plenty of time to take my Unity from your premises to the courier. My order #26561 was done on the 13th of May and I'm still waiting. When can I (seriously) expect it?

Fed up. Disappointed.

Hey @nativejibroney22,

Your order is due to arrive by end of business today according to the tracking information - unfortunately it's a bit confusing, since the fedex we use only seems to update once it's cleared customs in the destination country. Good thing is once it updates it arrives in 1-2 days, but bad thing is customers look at it and see no updates and understandably freak out, as that's not usually how Fedex operates. I'll have a chat with our forwarder to see why the services they use are different and how better tracking can be implemented.

@adrianenertion I haven't yet received  a tracking number for my #26561 order. Is it because it hasn't been posted yet, or because of some other problem?

Nope. Unless your fedex isnt my fedex.
Your forwarder simply has not handed over the parts. Reasons why are unimportant, but i think we all know it is simply because he asked too soon for labels (pressure much?) , while your chinese manu most likely shipped a couple of days too late so now everything is held up again. Lies lies lies. They (everyone inbetween) should understand transparency is the longterm.. (same in my country. Postal office is amazon obliged to deliver within the next day but they simply cannot make that, so Post will mark online "delivery tomorrow" and then later on mark "recepient not home" so they can come back the next day and still deliver as per amazon rules)

Anyways, big sk8 event here in Belgium on Saturday, would be nice still to receive the unities so i can distribute them on the event.

So, it did not arrive and now is the end of the business day today. According to what you are saying, since there is still no update on the tracking it hasn't even cleared customs yet and could be 3 days late if it manages to do so soon. Leading me to believe it definitely was not taken to the post office by your forwarder at the time it was said to have been.

Not in this case. My order is only unity(s). They just somehow managed to string me along once again. I mean seriously, who orders something in Dec and ai STILL waiting for it August of the following year?! (Take that back, ollinboard decks are still MIA) 

Regardless of excuse, the common denominator is their forwarder can run rogue and ship what they want and to whom. Theirs no accountability on Enertion‚Äôs part over their supply chain.

It turns out that I (and probably many others) were blatantly lied to. The forwarder did not take my unity to the post office till about 6 hours ago, an entire 5 days after they printed the label and told me they had sent it off to the post office. After all these months of waiting and being fed different stories, they still liked to squeeze an extra week out of us. You create a great product, but your business practices and the way you manage people's feedback to it are trash @adrianenertion . This will be the first and absolute last time I buy anything from your company and anytime I see someone on this forum debating going through it I will do what I can to warn and deter them.

No, but it is where the money to make batches comes from.
When you buy something from them , they should at least provide a badge saying "Proud Enertion Sponsor" or something.

If I called today and placed a paid order for 100 with the prospect of 100 more in 3 months I would receive those 100 before all you guys.    Its business.   Its shitty business but business none the less.

I ordered in March and just received mine last week. I have seen a few who ordered before me and have not received them yet. No idea what the hell is going on with the order que. Only reason I'm not mad is that I still have to get the battery together and my board is coming in from Tim but on a side note I realized just now that they charged me an extra 100 in USD due to a site currency conversion error. Let's see how long it takes to get a reply :man_shrugging:t3:
