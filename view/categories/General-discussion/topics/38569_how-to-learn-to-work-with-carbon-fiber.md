When I started I used @MasterCho thread for guidance   https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/hand-lay-carbon-fiber-wrapping-skinning-without-vacuum-bagging/15181

My post is number 45, it was my first time https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/hand-lay-carbon-fiber-wrapping-skinning-without-vacuum-bagging/15181/45

Yeah, you have to find a method that you can do/ can get the materials to do. There are tons of ways to do it.  Fibreglast is my source for misc parts, and sometimes carbon. (Its not the highest quality, but I'm used to working with aerospace industry grade carbon.)
Edit: sauce for materials http://www.fibreglast.com

I'm surprised there isn't carbon fiber courses would be a huge demand..i know id love to learn from someone in a workshop..

how much does a setup cost to build a board? gunna start with something smaller first tho

If you want to build a board, I would recommend looking up core materials, and do a sandwich type layup. Carbon wrapped around a aluminum honeycomb or cardboard honeycomb core.

A good resource for learning about carbon is from FSAE collegiate teams. It's a bunch of students who build formula one cars, some have done tons research on carbon layup, and have written reports.

ya seen a guy make a resin and honeycomb core deck on youtube looks good stuff. would you say resin be a easier starting pint than jumping into carbon or are they two different kettle fish?

Honestly, most of the papers they write are too science-y, If you want to go that route, look up vacuum bagging, or carbon infusion. That gives you the strongest result. Vacuum bagging is an art tho, it's going to take time to make it perfect.

Either way, you need a resin or epoxy to harden the carbon. Carbon itself is weak.

any good videos on it? I'm a visual learner ya could say lol.
ya ill start researching them now, how much would it cost to get started roughly? any parts youd recommend thanks for the help man

I'll find some videos for ya tomorrow. It can be kind of pricey, because you need to buy disposable parts for doing all of this stuff, then buying a decent pump. Let me find some stuff for ya, and I'll post it here.

Yes, "easy composites" is the best place to look at.

First, I would do more research and start on making carbon fiber sheets using the different process of hand layup and resin infusion.

You will only get the best result if you have access to a vacuum pump. I would just go with the prepeg carbon fiber.

The problem with prepreg is that it is wayy more expensive, and needs to be baked to fully cure. It's still better to vacuum bag it so there is no delamination or bubbles between the layers. You can get away with lower temp resins with a space heater, or some epoxies cure in a normal temperature room. Prepreg is amazing though, nothing beats a no-mess layup.

Vacuum bagging is enough, you dont have to use resin infusion to have good reasults...
Back then, when the source of all the informations...so called **silverfish longboarding** existed, there were tons of artcles about this...

From what I saw there, you can easily make foam core carbon wrap using just vacuum laminating and rarockit kit and have good results :)

a oven big enough to fit a 36 inch skateboard... vacuum pump...
pump is looking like a good deal ;)

I wish I had more CF in my life

Anybody in NYC with experience that wants to work with me on some integrated enclosure cf decks hit me up

A little off thread, noob question: On a fully integrated enclosure- can you ever open it up again if something breaks?

By fully integreate is meant that it is part of the deck and it has a cover from the top (usually) joined by screws :)

@mastercho Sometimes I see that instead of using resin, people use spray adhesive to lay down the carbon fiber properly and than they use resign to soak up the CF layer. I was always wondering which method is better ? and what are pros - cons.

```
For a complex shape of the mold, the spray adhesive can be applied to tack layers of dry material together. However, “General-purpose” spray adhesives are not specifically designed for use in the vacuum-infusion process because it will leave some residues on the surface.

@mastercho I am not following here ..what residue do you mean ? I assume that I use the spray to properly hand lay difficult shape with CF. Then after I lay it down I start to slowly soak it with Resin, so I don't see any residue anywhere that would bother me or worry. ..or am I missing something here ?

Also @MasterCho what is that base coat of resin that they use on Easy composite videos ? Is it regular resin ? I am from Europe and I havn't really see anything like base coat here in store so I am wondering about what it is.

```
The adhesive spray is being used to hold fabrics onto mold surfaces during resin infusion, which shouldn't interfere with the curing process of polyesters or epoxy resins. and make sure you apply a very light mist to the mold surface.

For the durability, the clear getcoat can be applied prior the resin infusion process, it brings the advantages over epoxy gelcoat of being highly polishable and offering UV protection.

Hi, i am gathering material and supplies to wrap my board in Carbon fiber cloth. I just read that we should not let the carbon fiber catch any dust which I did not know and I left it for several months hanging in my workshop. It was catching wood sawdust. I was wondering does the dust ruin the strength of the carbon fiber? Or is it just because of the aesthetic?
@MasterCho?
