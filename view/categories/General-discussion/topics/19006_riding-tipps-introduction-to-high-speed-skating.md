Hey guys. 
Browsing trough build posts, and general discussion I found out that most of you are extremely knowledgable on the electronics part. I don't even fully understand some of it since I am more a rider than a builder.

But reading trough most of the discussion I often read the same misconseption about riding a longboard. Example: Speed wobbles, makaing a board carvier, easier to turn, positioning, balance etc. I thought to myself, those guys may have ridden a longboard or a skateboard but mayby never donwhill/freeride. So they now go faster than they actually know how to drive properly since they never leanred it previous to esk8. There is a proper technique to all the turns, straights, corners on varius speeds. Foot placement, weight distribution, hip and arm motions.

So would you be be intrested if I made a short "guide" on how to get started? 
Subjects like : Bushings, truck settings, positions, tricks, additional gear, protectiv gear cheap and effective.

I mean you guys slowly but surely dip into the world of donwhill in terms of speed. At 30 mph or above a board, the skills become rapidly more and more important. To prevent insury and maximise fun.

Let me know if a short write up and a Video along side it would be wanted by you guys:)

cheers and happy riding


**How to ride a Longboard or my 2 cents on it at least.**

1.) Alright, lets do this. Before I start I wanted to say that all of the following is my opinion on my experience ,what I was thought from others. So you can ofcourse disagree or have an other take on it. I don't want to force anything on to you. I just realised by watching your videos of you riding your esk8-boards or in the comment section that there are plausable arguments how to deal with difficulties (turning, speed wobbles, bushings, truck tightness, positioning etc.) But allways on technical side of things, but the rider as the biggest factor in all those points gets disregarded most of the time. I am also not trying to impose a style by saying this is wrong stop doing it. All I am trying to do is improve your ride, your saftey while doing it and the progress you make as a rider. So I thought since I cannot contribute in an other area, I would like to give you an introduction to speed skating, its challenges, the porper technique to handle those difficulties and some tipps and tricks from a ambitious freeride/downhill rider, to make your ride safer, smoother and more enjoyable. So lets jump right into it:

1.) Introduction
2.) Set up 
  2.1.) Trucks
  2.2.) Bushings
  2.3.) The board itself
3.) _following soon, tm_ The Basics (gear and clothes)
  3.1.) the stance 
  3.2.) importance of arms and hipps
  3.2.) turns more indepth
  3.3.) straights, pushing speed
  3.4.) stopping (traditional, remote and emergency stop)
  3.5.) How to handle loss of controle 
  3.6.) general overview of your movement


2.) So lets talk set up. Our main goal by going about a build may vary from member to member. Most of you go for practicallity (clearence for enclosure, stiff so 1 enclosure works fine etc.) Most of you end up with a pretty decent board if I had to judge it simply on the board itself for higher speed. Different boards do bring different charasteristics with them though. I could now try to word it out for you but with this link it will be easier. https://www.muirskate.com/longboard-guide/
Its actually a very good amount of information. Not very indepth but a good way to start, since they touch almost all parts of a board. So on the left you can choose betweend deck, trucks, wheels, bearings and bushings. Give it a quick read, its pretty much on point.

2.1.) Trucks. 
Well there were are very limited, most hubmotors come with trucks and belt system require you to go a specific model (caliber mostly) which fit the motor mounts. Of course you can make your own mounts which is the better option so you can actually choose the trucks which suits your riding style. And yes trucks make a huge impact, bigger than you may imagine. If I were to compare my donwhill board to my raptor 1 (which I love) it goes something like this. One is a precise sport and utility tool, which alows me to hit speeds above 80km/h / 50mp/h while knowing exactly how it will behave. It is reliable, durable and famailiar. The raptor is an awesome e-board but not such a great "board" really. The missing porper concave, it has no drop/micro drop in front which makes some downhill action on mild 50kmh already and adventure of sorts. So know what kind of truck you want, baseplate angle, turn radius, wheelbase etc. and go from there. If your focus is truly to enhance your experience rather than save money. 

2.2) Bushings.
Another part which is mostly overlocked or threated like something minor. Well let me tell you, it can finish out your ride so well or ruin it almost at the finish line. Go to a local Longboard shop, talk with them. Tell them how you want your ride to change, they will be friendly and eager to help. Let them change bushings go for a small run, come back change. Rins and repeat until you have that moment when you think, damn this is it!. To bushings there are 2 things I need to say though. First, if you want your board to turn easier, carvier and more responsable, please don't try to adjust that with bushings. Bushings are basically rubber which gives you on cerntain degrees of movement a certain amount of resitance. BUT, if you go in a turn with 10 km/h or 30km/h makes a huge difference. Since at higher speeds the pressure or weight put on the bushings in turns is so much greather. Leaving you in a position when the board suddenly behaves differently in turns depending on your speed. Second, learn to ride rather hard bushing/barrel bushing. So you actually need weight distribution to turn not just flexing your toes. And if you want to make your board carvier do not changge the bushing like I said, get a 5degree or even 10degree angel baseplate. Mount it instead of a riser and you will be astonished by the difference. 

2.3) The board.
Well this is a subject which basically comes down to opinion, liking and experience. I would never be as arrogant to say this or that is the best deck this and that is crap. I have ridden a lot of boards, but by no means allows that to judge a board by its loock. So lets start with choices. There is an endless amount of boards from brand, clones or independant board makers. So choose wisely. Again most of you go for loocks, practicality or price when choosing a board. Which is perfectly fine but has a different focus. I really don't care how my board loocks when I am hitting more than 45km/h and need to get the next turn right since I see a car coming the opposite way. In that moment I want the porper tool for the job. So when you start your build, think about what the boards needs to do for you. Be flexy, carvy and relaxing for you bad knee ? Go for a vanguard build, split enclosures and you got your self set up. You want speed, feel locked into your board and stability? Go for a porper donwhill topmount deck. Just don't try to make aboard do something i was not intended to is all I am saying. This point goes for your whole set up. If you build a dual set up, 10s or even 12s you will be fast, so don't disregard your board as the pice of wood where you attach the tech to. See it as the beating heart of your project. Whenevr I search the forum for board suggestion, it is all about price loocks or having an easier time placing an enclosure. Very rarely if even you talk about the board itself. You guys hit speeds that I hit after years and years of practice.

3.) Gear and clothes:

Well a few have awesome gear, some even celebrate protection like esk8 france and sadly some of you don't really wear any. I may sound like your mother when you were younger but please allways wear sufficent protection. You may think or say:" oh well I didn't fall a single time last year, I can do without the protectors or even helmet". Sure fair point, but that is not what protection is for. Insurrance and protection are very similar in this. You don't cover your insurrance for your daily life, you cover it for the day X when shit goes bad. Same goes for protection, you prepare yourself properly to the circumstance that you stand on top of a Longboard deck with a braking system that is everything else than fail proof. So your own board or a biker or even a car can endager you, for that reason protect yourself. I myself communted daily twice between my uni and my home all year long. I allways wear a helmet, gloves and porper footwear. Also a pair of biker jeans with kevlar and a motorsport jacket. The jacket itself is amazing, solid protectors, comfy to wear and pretty stealthy. This is the one I am using at the moment: https://www.dragginjeans.net/clothing/womens/womens-jackets/draggin-roo-hoody-detail.html
If you plan a serious ride and want to push limits, there is no such thing as overkill when it comes to your safety. Most of you are older than me, have kids and a lot more responsabilities. You cannot afford to be out of commision so to speak, if you could prevent some of it.
On a side note. The most dangerous part is when you let somone try your board for the first time, so if you lend them your board also lend them your helmet. Not much speed is required to turn a harmless fall into a serious accident. It is easy to forget how fast you are actually going, while completely trusting the brakes. Most importantly, falling of your board at 25mph+ while in a standing up positions is ugly, especially when colliding with an other object.

3.1.) The stance

So why is the stance and changing it important? Well for a couple of reason, mostly though to achieve stability. Your feet should be about shoulder wide on the deck, allowing you to freely transfer your weight quickly. Even though your deck may be pretty wide, most of your weight needs to be in the center of the board, again for stability. If you position yourslef on the axis, light movement wont have as much as an effect as If you were to stand at the edges. This is a great first point towards safely approching higher speeds. Now comes the tricky part, your feet. I rode alot with my local esk8 group and all of them had the traditional cruiser stance. 
Like so: 

http://www.longboardmagazine.eu/wp-content/uploads/heelside-feet-placement-on-longboard-correct.jpg

Perfectly fine to cruise and coast around, making your board very responsive and easy to turn. But I would argue that it is rather unsuited for higher speeds. In that stance as soon as you push the throttel and the acceleration hits, most of your weight will be on the backfoot. At this point your backfoot has way to much to do. Since most of your weight is on the back foot it is responsable for turning, balance, holding your weight and supporting your upper body. This is the perfect recipe for speed wobbles and bad controll of the board. And since your foot is angled almost 90 degrees, you have also to much weight outside the axis meaning all your movements have a larger impact than wanted. I have to say that I very rarely see non ek8 stand like this. Since 95% of poeple skating actually need to push and standing like that would make pushing almost impossible. So the stance you would want to get used to loocks more like this:

http://stokedskateboards.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/tumblr_lhda1hjcNz1qhveuko1_500.jpg

This is a speed tuck, you don't need to tuck that tight fo course but the stance should go in  that general direction in order to perfom proper manouvers and turns. I reccomend you read through this blog, its a peerfect write up about the speed tuck : 
http://stokedskateboards.com/blog/staying-speedy-perfecting-your-tuck/

This might loock uncomfortable and unescesarry complicated at first, but why build a board that goes 30mph if you cannot take it around a corner ? Mayby you enjoy straights and light carving but don't like turns since you have to slow down or you cannot even take them. I guarantee you, give it a few months in that stance, learn it, get comfortable in doing it, especially in corners and turns and you will have a completely different experience. Like motorcycling, after a certain amount of skill, challenging routes, mountain passes for example will become your favourite thing to ride. Corners, the play between speed and centrifugal (?) force is an awesome feeling. And I don't see you taking turns while standing up straight, with straight legs and horizontal foot placement. Definetly not safely. The first important step in learning this stance, is actually learning to push. If you push porperly your front foot needs to to be in the center of the deck in a mostly vertical position to the board. 45 degrees or less is optimal. Now if you sucesfully put your front foot down in that position and managed to push wihtout having to stop (catch balance, or put the back foot on the board after every other push) you fixed your balance issues. Meaning you are able to move around on the deck while only having one foot down, which is important. So push a few times, get on the board and give if some throttel, but don't fall back in to the bad habbit and change your stance. Keep your fornt foot where it is. Now try to align your shoulders and hipps with the trucks. So now if you want to turn, you need to shift your weight to the side. Dont brake your stance for this, don't move your feet either. Simply go deeper in to your knees and lean with your whole body to the side. This is sufficent for slight turns. If it were to be a tight turn or even corner, go even deeper in to your knees. Then if its a backside turn, turn your shoulders slightly away from the direction you are going and put your behind over the board. Giving you alot of weight pushing into the curve while maintining a low center of gravity. Reducing the forces that you have to hold out. If it is a frontside turn, put your right arm out (regular stance, goofy would be left arm), and now lean "into" your armpit but facing donwards. I realise this sounds weird and not very clear, I hope I can clear this up in my first video part.

Of course in traditional downhill, you often breake your stance in order to slide since you cannot grip trhough the corner, but I won't go into sliding at all, since most of you have a traditional remote making things alot harder, and I still don't know how smart it is to slide with an e-board. In my experience a terrible idea with belt drives and haven't tried it with my unfinished carvon build at this time. So we want to keep our stance and if we need to reduce speed either let the air do the work for us and form a pocket between your chest and you legs or shortly stand up and put your arms out (while letting go of the throttel of course) or simply engage the brake.

3.2.) Importance of arms and hips

I will not go too much into that in this form. I will focus on this subject more in a video part, since such things are so much easier to show than to explain in Words (for me at least). 

So let us talk hips first, your best friends in helping you turn, shifting your weight around and prepare for a stance switch. It is important that your core is stable and rather trained for better stability, to prevent back pain and allowing you to let your hips “loose”. Meaning your board will not always go straight as an arrow on higher speeds. It will sometimes drift of to the side, a rough patch on the pavement will turn it into a survey feeling in turns and bumps and hits in the road can make it rather hectic. Now it is important to have your feet locked in, your knees bent and your hips loose. Allowing you to eat up some of the unforeseen hits and movements. Since you are in a neutral position with your hips, you made yourself a lot of room available to react. Now again this will sound like someone making rocket science out of something simple, but it is just the way I have been thought by a very gifted athlete. Try to think of your hips as a buffer, a way to soak up what the road throws at you. A way to correct bigger mishaps. The most important thing I will add is that you need to learn to let things happen to you. May sound very weird at first, but the risk of overreacting, oversteering and therefore making it worse is bigger than you might think. We all know the moment when we get hit with something unprepared that may even scare us for a split second, and exactly this split second of mostly unwanted rapid motion is what can ruin your day. So give your reaction some time, if you need to react with weight shifting or directional change, let it come from your hips.

Arms. Well most people would say that arms are there to find balance, I find that very counterproductive. Find a position where you can rest your arms (I myself have them interchanged on my back). If you continuously move and wave around your arms you will not have an easier time to find balance, it will actually make it harder. Balancing you out on the board should come from your feet, your knees, and your arms are like your hips a buffer to sudden changes. To react to slip, a hit or otherwise unforeseen movement. So try to hold them still, and if you use them do so with intent. Also, learn to use them as a braking tool. If you don’t need to slow down fast but want to or need to for a change of direction, stand up hold your arms out and let the air stop you, less stress on the motors and I think an enjoyable way to reduce speed. I am still not too sure about slowing down with the brake honestly, I also never informed myself about that. However, my board can go 45km/h and if I am above that number, the brake behaves very weird so I slow down with the so-called “Air brake” or with carving/slide.

3.3.) Turns more in-depth.

I quickly realise that I have to show it first in a video and then response by writing. …

3.4.) straights pushing speed.

Disclaimer: If I talk about pushing your own top speed, I am generally talking about 50km/h, not wanting to exclude anyone since you can adapt it to your own speed, but this is the point where things start to become serious. Serious fun but also potentially, seriously dangerous. In addition, how to find a way that works for you is very personal. This is meant as an Input and in no way a fixed set of rules. More importantly though, this is where your gear gets more important with every little bit of speed you go faster. I do not only mean clothes, helmets gloves etc. I also mean your trucks and your hardware. I have seen so sketchy stuff of trimmed down trucks to make a motor mount fit. If you take away serious amounts of material I wouldn’t feel comfortable to go for a speed run. At speed of 50 or above there are scary forces around, which you and your material need to handle. It is great that you want to go faster and faster but never loose respect of the speed and as a reality check, look at any other type of transportation who travel at those speeds. Look at the safety measures, the fail-safes, the regulations etc. that come with it. Then realise that you are traveling on a piece of wood with four wheels at similar speed. So all the precautions you would find on other means of transportation have to be taken care of by YOU.  

So for those of you where this is a little too far let us take it down a notch. So If you are not comfortable in maxing out your board, I would assume that it is because of one of the following reasons. Speed wobbles, scared of the vibrations, loss of control or an overall nervous feel to it. This means you are not comfortable on your ride in general and your posture/stance may not be optimal. This is a hobby, so it should be fun, so have fun. What I mean by this is do not just push the throttle and be happy your DIY build works etc. Have fun riding a longboard before you have fun riding an esk-8. Meaning get familiar with the deck, move around it, change your stance, get low get high. Experiment on your platform, start to carve, take turns, take them slow then fast then as low as you dare. Try to simulate or force all the skills you would need to react to certain situations. What would happen if the remote cut out and you need to stop? Learn to foot brake with a heavy board; maybe if you feel adventurous even get into slides. What if you need to get home and a strong wind comes up? Learn to tuck so you could overcome that as well. I could go on and on, make your board feel second nature to you. All the things that scare you or hold back are exactly the things you need to work on. I know is much nicer just to relax have fun and not putting in the work. But Isn’t it a sad imagination never unleashing your board full potential. I always said to myself when I was scared of a course or not really feeling like working one something:” You only know where a rode leads you, when you followed it until the end”. My hope/dream is that esk-8 morphs from a hobby a partnership between tech and fun to a competitive battle between man and machine. Sorry I had to write that, even if that sound awful 

So, you have to be comfortable in your tuck as I explained above. Comfortable in holding it for an extended period of time and comfortable in manoeuvring without having to break your tuck. Every slight movement or change in your position reflects in more resistance and lower speed. So try to stay calm and learn to enjoy it. If you get to a speed were you either get uncomfortable, weird feeling in your stomach or plain fear then stand up and slow down. Generally, fear is a great feat when it comes to downhill or higher speeds. I always understood the feeling in that context as a normal reaction to something unknown. It can be either the course you are not familiar with or a speed that you have never achieved before. Find yourself a nice downhill sloap ( or if 40km/h already sounds scary for you then skip the next part), ideally a one way street so no cars can come the opposite direction, cut corners or endanger you in any way. Now learn the course, try to remember corners, how tight they were, potential hits in the road, rough patches etc. In a way try to plan your “race/run” ahead, like every racing sportsman in any discipline would do. It helps so much in overcoming uncertainty or fear. As soon as you know your course very well you no longer have to worry about anything else than yourself and how you tackle said course. Now if you have a belt driven dual set up I do not think you can hit much more than 55 to 60km/h because of the resistance. So If you are somewhat comfortable around that number great, this is going to be easy for you. Slow down on corners and the second you hit the long straight in your course, go into your speed tuck. Now there are two ways to go about this. You can keep your tuck until you have to slow down for the next turn. If you managed to do that there, is nothing more for you to do, other than learning turns and corners with higher speed. Alternatively, find a steeper grade and rinse and repeat. If you are not familiar with that speed, it is only logically that you feel scared and do not really feel like tucking all the way down. So start by going your personal top speed that you are somewhat comfortable with. Now try to familiarise yourself with that speed further, how your board acts, how the wind resistance feels etc. So instead of going straight in a tuck like the option above, take a standing position and try to enjoy the ride, carve, move around the deck, and move your hips to move sideways instead of your feet. Make the speed feel normal to you. If you should still be too fast, try air braking, learn to handle the board with your body, and do not just rely on the remote to do everything for you.

Vidoes:

1,) Just for fun, first and lousy attempt at commented riding. Also to slow of a course.

Absolutely agree your point. 
Being longboarder pumping on the road will never know the downhill hill speed like on ESK8. 

Looking forward your "guide".

That would be awesome, especially considering some people get into this hobby without even longboarding before hand. When controlling your speed and breaking is so effortless it makes it easy to overlook this stuff.

@michichopf I think that would be an excellent contribution! I'm just as you described; a long-time skater but new(ish) to higher speeds.

This is one of the big challenges in esk8- getting folks to take the risks seriously and to give proper respect to the dangers of high-speed riding.

Before esk8, someone really had to work to achieve those speeds, and the acceleration was so slow that there were a lot of tactile cues to help a rider understand their relative speed.

With DIY builds, we can go for 0-30 pretty easily, and as you've described, that speed requires a whole different skill set to do safely.

I think a lot of folks would benefit from your tutorials!

I do appreciate your contribution to this topic.

My first fall ever was last year on my first esk8 via the wobbles. Never ever skated in my life before that.

It was a pretty slow progress of about 3 to 4 months of constant riding before I was able to hit top speed on my Evolve GT.

First thing I learnt was to wear gloves with schapoid protection that would also allow your hands to slide. The grab effect upon impact was bloody unbelievable.

i've been itching to see what an experienced downhill longboarder could do on an esk8. 
I keep picturing slides going up the hill! and of course POWER Slides! but that is obviously for the advanced class... :sunglasses:

alright, I changed the way I am going to do this. I will do it in a mini series of posts. Going over all the relevant parts. Then you can ask, comment or disagree and I will make a short video to answer those things abd follow it up with the next subject. So I would like to beginn with the set up, which will be coming within the hour.

Edit: updated my original post. I will continiously add information and video material :)

Great write up. I agree with everything but the part about not using harder bushings. I am a larger rider, (around 210), and I know how to ride, but I just find harder bushings more comfortable. Of course I have never tried "speed skating",  but I know what I like. It was nice that you suggedted people try multiple bushing durometers and types as they can significantly change your ride.

Good point, never took weight into consideration there. SO you are correct, of yourse with different weights there are different starting points.

at the same time...maybe it's not good to tell anyone how they should do it as they can come up with an unbiased personally related decision.   It kinda reminds me of the amount of time people spend getting their golf swing looked at and assessed, yet really all that's important is they hit the ball with the right speed and direction.   taking the pic of the guy on the top here....I stand similarlly when going fast but have some hugely diffferent things going on, such as my hands are in front, elbows bent, and hands under the chin.   when leaning down low and going fast it's a more natural feeling as ...if anything goes wrong, which on an eboard seems only a mater of time, I have my hands in front of me for the superman slide on them as apposed to my face.  I also feel much more stable with the front foot positioned practically horizontal to the direction of travel, and it does all the turning really, and the rear foot is positioned in-line with travel direction.

ooo one thing I think has a lot of value if going high speed is a board with drop to it as it allows a lower center of gravity for more control and more importantly it will have surface on both the front and back of the board that has a concave that I can lean against when braking or accelerating quickly.   making an eboard with such a shape, and not bottoming out on the motor...I'd say hub motors are better for high speed!

Very well put.
That is why I opened by saying that I do not want to impose anything anyone. I got asked the same questions multiple times, so I thought I made a collection of things I am familiar with that could help someone. By no means was it intended to sound like a status quo or the best way. Just a potential guideline for people that are loocking for it. 
Tue golf swing was a perfect methaphor. I would like to think that it can help to know in wich general direction it should go but I would never get up on the high horse and proclaim anything more than that.
I hope I didnt come across as a jerk or anything, my only intention was to help and contribute.
Valid point though thank you.

Best way to stop speed wobbles is to ride with your knees bent, to the point it feels like a squat.
Lower your center of gravity.

So, I updated 3 more chapters. I am sorry that there is still no video. But saddly I had a stupid fall days ago, because a car drove like a retarded mongroll. A few stiches, bruises, cuts and some skin missing. Nothing major though. Up and shredding within the week. Just have to wait until my hips work the way I want them too. There is allways thos 2-3 sketchy rides after a fall in my case. So I will mayby need until the end of the month. :slight_smile:

Good healing to u. Don't wash!  Stay dry. 

I like this thread and keep thinking of things: even layers of seemingly non-protective clothing is very protective I find.  
Even thin cotton gloves serve me well when falling and allow great feel on the trigger.
Trying to "run off the board" when things go wrong always ends up causing much more damage to me than sliding out.

Well as a true beginner the best advice goes like this:Try it, eat shit, try it again - rinse and repeat." hope you enjoy your journey into esk8. I was actually part of somone first steps on a board recently. At first he was overwhelmed and doing it alone didn´t realy do much for him. He was actually ready to sell his board when he joined our group rides.Since we were very active during that time he kept the board and actually really enjoyed it by the end of summer.

Haha yeah my first day I did eat shit. Throttle is sensitive and my board ran out from under me and dumped me. Still have bruises. I wear a helmet and gloves and when we get into warmer weather I'll start wearing my pads again to protect exposed skin. Still hurts to fall but every fall is a learning experience. Right now 15 mph feels like warp speed I can't even imagine hitting my supposed top speed of 30 mph. I'll always wear the helmet and I push everybody I talk to - esk8 or not - to wear one too. I've had 2 concussions and they are not fun. One of them affected me for 6 months after the accident.

For those who don't think footbraking is a usuable technique for slowing down at higher speeds.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ar00KGOO8k

I footbrake all the time. There's not a lot of room for error in the city and with all the traffic, there's often not enough space to stop any other way. I don't go nearly as fast as Zak does. I typically keep my top speed under 25mph and while I usually use my board's brake, I also find footbraking to be useful. Usually I air brake to slow down to under 20 before I put my foot down, but there are times going down hill where I need a little extra resistance to slow down. 

Thanks michichopf for the read. A lot of good info and useful techniques. 

Esk8's have allowed people to skate well beyond their abilities with a false sense of security. Many often forget how dangerous going 20+mph on a wood plank can be. I see a lot of new skaters going 24mph on their new boards and you can tell by how they're riding that they're not entirely comfortable with what they're doing. There's so many things that years of skating on a regular board give you that help with balance, control, and getting out of sticky situations that you don't really get with an esk8.

Zak is awesome, huuge respect of his "work". 
I totally agree with everything you said especially the last part about years of learning vs. e-boarding. This is exactly why I started this whole thread. People spend 1000's of dollars on parts. Optimising every component, tinker around with Vesc settings, get the best wheels etc. But in the end they are building a tool (a dangerous one at that), which has to be used properly. Not only to ensure their safety and the poeple around them BUT most importantly to guarantee that those hard earned dollars and hours of work and research reech their full potential. There is so much awesome and fun things to do on an e-board wich cost zero cents. Just dexterity and will.

Footbraking is awesome if properly done. But I realised with multiple attempts teaching e-boarders (which were new to longboarding) how to footbrake and stay stable at the same time at 20mph+ was harder than expected. I myself got into a habbit to not use footbraking 90% of the time. If you ride daily you ruin an excessive amount of shoes :slight_smile:

Wow sick video this raw run, i love it!!
We all did it, footbrake was a way to brake, mostly when you cannot do speed checks or slide properly, if you go fast you will get all kind of woobles and weird reactions from the skate, to do it going fast at least your body should be strong enough to absurd this uncontrolled reactions. Not so safe remove one foot from the deck at 25+mph. But yes, is super cool! 
Electric brakes are by far a lot better, safer and it charges your battery!

Ha ha ha! yes, I definitely have gone through my share of shoes! I started using my board's brake more often because my messed up back forced me to upgrade from my $40 Vans to $110 Frye's. Also, being a life-long skater, I'm used to going through shoes like water. 

Gear Aid Freesole. It's a little messy, but will make your shoes go a lot farther. World's better than shoe-goo. You can also throw some rice on the surface when it's partially dry to create tread.

When you're pushing, you learn a lot about control and balance on one foot. It's probably one of the harder things to learn. With e-boards, you never have to put your foot on the ground.

good points.
If I have to stop or loose speed very suddenly I will mostly slide or speed check. When I can forsee the neded loss of speed I do a mixture of air breaking and foot braking. Hardly touch the remote over 50.

How much time it toock to learn? Well you are never done, there ar still speeds, corners and ways you are uncomfortable with so I would say something around 100-200 hours of practice for the basics.

Where are you from? It looks familiar. 

You should do at least one video from the viewpoint of someone following behind you, so you can really demonstrate what you are talking about with stances, and so you can show what you think right and wrong looks like on an esk8. You could also script out what you want to say and show what you want concisely, and edit out any info you didn't mean to include in the final cut of the video.

Nide video, keep up the good work!

I'm happy to see that someone is taking up the job of informing eskate users on downhill and free ride technique. It was strange not to see more discussions on turning your tucks with the proper bushing for your weight, wedging and dewedging your trucks to fool with your truck geometry. Downhill forums often have long threads about truck tuning. I haven't been on a eskate yet; I'm waiting on a battery pack,  and am interested to see if I can do a standing slide on it. Ive easily hit faster speeds on a regular skateboard downhill then I expect my eskate to be to be able to hit. Bellow are some links on wedging your tucks.

Since its apparently still of intrest to some and I have a couple boards running again I will pick up where I left it. Spring early summer is allways super busy since freeride/downhill season starts. And even though both sports have the board part in common, the communities hardly ever meet. So I wasn't esk8 that much, but will get a few sessions in hopefully with usable content this time. Had the pleasure of doing some technical training with Patrick Schwitzer even, so I got to know proper teaching methods.

I will mainly focus on stoping and movement in my first update if that allright with all of you.

I would suggest that learning how to fall is one of the most important skills you can have.  

When teaching my kid to skate, because he wants to go a 100 mph everywhere, I put him on a driveway that had grass at the end and had him run the board into the grass for experience.  We started out slow and then gradually went faster until he learned that holding your arms straight to brake your fall really frikkin hurts, keep those arms bent. 

When you're going to fall you are either going to be able to run it off or not, when NOT learn to roll.  If you are falling backwards, twist and roll, and tuck your head in.  

It takes practice just like anything else, being bad at something is the first step to being good at something.

Good point. That is actually an important skill. Falling will eventualy happen. Problem here is, if I fall which happens multiple times every week, I either slide it out on my pucks and shoes,  on my knee guards or roll over on my backprotector and slide on that. I would argue that rolling is super dangerous at certain speeds since you cannot controle the direction (and that is somewhat important on mountainpasses ;)). But I think that is something I should go over. But again I might not be the best reference since I am allways crazy overdressed when it comes to protectors and therefore I am used to take full advantage of them when falling.

This is one of the most useful things I have ever read on the forum. I am millimeters from impending injury every second I am on my board. The last time I was on a skateboard the Berlin Wall was still standing, gas was 88 cents/gal, and Madonna was considered to racy for TV (all 3 channels). Even then, it was a penny board and I just rode it hanging on to a rope tied to a bicycle seat (thanks, Michael J. Fox). So THANK YOU from both me and the other participants in my group health plan.

I can dig that, most people are a little more laid back in their skating style, meaning no pucks or knee guards or back protection.  We all prolly should, but most of us don't.  Knowing how to fall before you ARE going to fall keeps the fun going 😀.

You make a good point. Using the implementation you choose to wear is very important. Also, Low speed falls can be easier to tumble out of than high speed. You really need to try to maintain control in high speed falls.

I use a motorcycle jacket and a helmet  but when you fall you still feel it, you just don't end up as  bloody. I'm thinking of following your example, and get better downhill gear. Interested if you have any ideas about remote compatible puck gloves?

I've been trying to figure that out for a while now. I'd like to try and mount a puck on the bottom of the remote, but I'm not sure if it would create issues with the vibration. Basically, if you make a fist, the remote is inside your grip and the puck is at the bottom of your fist. It would take some getting used to, but I think it could work for right hand turns. 

In all honesty, if and when I take a spill, that remote is going to get used like a puck anyways. I ride with a puck on my left hand and then a slide glove with no puck and the thumb cut out on my right hand.

Mostly I wear both gloves but have only one puck. Allows me to emergency slide and to catch my falls. But when riding hard in the paint or during winter, I used the ticket holder from skiing on the remote, so when I fell I let go of the remote and it "zipped" to my waist. Also depends on the remote. With a nano it is absolutely possible to use it with a puck.

The thing I played around in my mind is 3d printing a different form for a g2b mod out of ABS and ataching a puck onto it. But so far nothing concrete.

I have to admit, I never played around much with angled risesr on my DH set up. I did put them on my E-board though. I have just been blessed with trucks. I run 45 / 30 degrees already so no need to ever use Wedges :) But also a valid addition I will add. I feel weird only doing small updates on this thread so I am waiting until its finally dry here to pile up some information.

I think CarvOn had some ideas about this, im not sure are they going to implement such a remote later on but you can check some of their vids where they should show the concept.. perhaps a few ideas might stuck with you for this option.

One thing that I think is often overlooked is HOW to fall, because it's not a matter of if you'll fall, but when you'll fall. The biggest thing (for me at least) is to stay as loose as possible, and also resist the urge to put your arms out in front of you. Putting your arms out will likely lead to you doing a scorpion, smashing your face, and probably broken bones in your upper extremities. I've never downhill long boarded, but I have snowboarded for 25 years, and I feel like that experience has been invaluable to me, because falling on snow and ice (while not as damaging as concrete) at upwards of 80 mph can still definitely fuck you up. When I ate shit going 20 mph on my board, the muscle memory kicked in and I rolled out of it with only a scraped elbow. Unfortunately, it's not practical to practice falling off your board at high speeds on, and it's not likely somebody will remember what to do when the time comes unless they have experience with it, but I still think it should be talked about more than it is.

That's actually incorrect for e skate. What you're describing, in terms of staying loose, is great for snowboard because you have two factor contributing to cushion, snow/ice and jackets. Road skate is different, you receive not only the impact but also road rash. Road rash is incredibly detrimental to the human skin, the only way to avoid that is to wear joint protective gears such as elbow guard (hard shell). When you fall, you will slide out all the momentum with protective gears. On top of that, there are other variables such as cars and debris and trash on the roads so loosening up your body might not be a good idea. 

But you are right, learning HOW to fall is very important. Just gotta have someone film themselves falling to show the community what responsible falling looks like. :sweat_smile:

Sadly it has been crazy lately, got injured, uni started, taking care of a foster puppy, founding a start up etc. I will get to it the next 2 weeks, Focusing mostly on Videos, won't have the time for beatiful action shots or whatever, will just be me and a gopro, since its already cold here and not much riders are joining.

TLDR: Had shit to do, sorry for the dealy, will be continued in 1-2 weeks.

Hello everyone. 
It has been a long time, too long since I updated this post but more than ever I want all of you to be safe and have fun. This year (spring/summer) I found a group of insanely ambitious and dedicated skaters (downhill) and had the opportunity to learn so much. Some of them are within the top 500 riders on our planet. So 3-4 sessions a week, countless bruises and road rash was constant. One day though we got reminded how lethal the combination of an open road, 50km/h and even a stellar rider can be. Sadly we lost a friend within our local downhill group, a rider, a true ball of humour and fun. He died doing what we all share a passion for, skating. It was a hard hit, not easy to digest. It made us rethink a lot of stuff about safety, rider's etiquette and how we organise our rides. We had meetings about safety, discussions with first aid specialists and  formulated a new rule book. More and more boards are coming to the market that exceed speeds of 45/km h/h, also more poeple are building faster and faster boards. So I think it is easier than ever to draw comparison between downhill and esk8 than ever. The closer you come to downhill the more problems you inherit from it.

I am neither the best skater nor the best teacher. I am not trying to impose anything on anyone. Happy to concede anything you deem false, but I want to try to give my best to share my experience and the things I learned. Even if it prevents only one serious accident I would be extremely happy.

Alright lets jump right back into it I still had 2 unfinished points, as well as suggestions from you guys.

**3.5.) how to handle loss of control**
**3.6.) general overview of your movement**
**3.7.) various tuning tips for your set up.**
**3.8.) falling**
**3.9.) stopping / sliding.**
**4.0.) presence of mind / thinking while riding.** 


**3.5.) How to handle loss of control**
No mater the speed you are going, what is key is being able to act, not only react. For that you need presence of mind. If you go into panic mode you can either be lucky, get hurt or make it a lot worse than it had to be. My idea here is, all of us go into panic mode if too many unfamiliar circumstances come together. E.g: A road you don't know, a speed you are not familiar with, weather conditions or stress factors such as vehicles, a lot of people looking, a free animal or a loss of connection to your remote (no brakes). So we have to get familiar and more experienced. Again stressing the importance of riding a normal skateboard once in a while, try stuff out. Run into a grass patch and try to catch your fall. Provoke wobbles at lower speeds and learn to ride them out. Fully gear up and go ride on wet ground or for true adrenalin seekers wet leaves. You can simulate the situation you are most uncomfortable with or are the most afraid of. It is so important to do it. It allows you to control the surroundings (have someone with you you). So fall, get back up rinse and repeat. In a safe and controlled environment ofc. You will learn your own recipe, your own series of motions to counter certain events. The more you educate yourself and the more you practice the better you will handle oh shit moments. (e.g.: a free-runner jumping 8-10 meters down, without being hurt due practice and technique versus us who would probably be banged up even at 3-5 meters).
Since your skate is the only thing allowing you to control your speed, direction and turning you should never part with your board during those moments. As soon as you let go or try to run off, you surrender every possibility of controlling the outcome. 
I could try to word out countering speed wobbles, catching yourself when your wheels block up etc. But if those things occur you have to react with your muscle memory, there is no way around it. You need to practice, practice, practice... I think you get my point. 

If you have an esk8 group for regular rides or friends that skate. Maybe get into the habit to go gravity skating every third group ride. Learn to carve at higher speeds, try to drift, slide and footbrake. It is so much fun and gives you so much safety and security. Also it is a good reality check for everyone. I imagine most of you are comfortable topping out your board, so 45km/h it is. Now go on a normal board and go 45km/h. Most of you will shit their pants and that is a GOOD thing. You just realised that you are way over your limits. The scenario has happened that your esk8 became a regular longboard due multiple failures. This is something I sometimes struggle to comprehend. Why would anyone go faster than he can reliably, safely and quickly stop his board on his own. When discussing this with freeriders/downhillers they made jokes about Darwin awards etc. Even though it is harsh it rings true somewhat...

**3.6.) general overview of your movement.**
As long as you are cruising along, having a chat with your squad, your movement in general doesn't mater much. Now lets say you are riding very aggressively. Fast acceleration and deceleration, now it is important to have a stable core. During acceleration it is even more important to not let the force move your whole body weight backwards. I would make the argument, that there is an ideal weight distribution for controlling your skateboard.  Of course that changes if you change up the task you and your body want to do together. Nonetheless think about it as preset settings your body can take on to best tackle the movement ahead. You want to go full throttle, then prepare your body for it. YOU dictate where your weight is and where your hips are facing. You cannot expect to plant yourself on your deck hit the throttle and hope for the best. The same goes for turns, de-acceleration and  carving. We don't have a steering wheel or a bicycle handlebar. So it is fairly obvious that your weight distribution aside from granting you stability is your tool of control when it is comes to skating. Allowing the board to influence you so much that it is basically taking over control is sketchy. Be aware of what is going to happen, where your journey is taking you. Since we are fairly slow compared to other disciplines you have so much time to adjust foot placement, centre of gravity, speed and weight distribution. Again you do you at 20km/h but don't fool yourself into thinking that the same effort should be made at 45+. 
At the beginning it will feel like work. The more you ride the board and not the other way around, you will realise that it is actually more relaxing for your muscles, your back and knees if you allow your body to prepare for any forces before he has to overcompensate. Also, this is more obvious if you go gravity skating. Different speeds, different tasks require other motions. (you wouldn't just put on foot on the street while riding and hope to footbrake and not face plant for example).
TLDR: Be active, you are riding a skateboard. You shouldn't be chauffeured around.


**3.7.) Tuning tips for your setup**.

If you made it this fare you seem generally interested in improving anything really. I said before that the rider is more important than the equipment, still there are a few things I haven't seen suggested yet on here.

- Get yourself a top hat washer. It is a washer that fits partially inside your bushing and around your kingpin. It limits slop. With precision trucks, this wouldn't be a concern but with cast trucks it makes a surprisingly big difference in my opinion. https://www.muirskate.com/longboard/products/54111/array-machined-barrel-cupped-barrel-sleeved-washer-combo-pack-four-pack

- Pivot cup, pivot cup, pivot cup. It is so cheap to upgrade and is indeed important. 10-15$ vs your 1k+ set up. Just do it :) http://www.riptidesports.com/pivot-cups-and-tubes-explored/

- Wedging. Was mentioned in the comments. I ride 45 /30 (25) so never used it in gravity skating but used angled risers on my esk8 set up. So posting it again for visibility (thx @Lawndart ) http://cdn6.bigcommerce.com/s-0hh7c41/product_images/uploaded_images/wedges.jpg?t=1421781518

- Foot stopper. I love em, and use em on every set up even electric ones. It make you so much more confident. You know where your front foot is at all times. Sort of feels like a hook and especially in turns lock you in even more. You can buy one, I allways did the "ghetto way". Longer screw at the forefront baseplate holes, take a long barrel bushing and a cupped washer. E.g: https://www.instagram.com/p/BbHLjDTjMms/?taken-by=janvonbergen

- Grip tape. Use some quality grip tape, if its old or worn out, change it. You don't need to go for extra coarse or something like vicious. It will mess up all your clothes super fast if you are not used to it.

-  Custom concave. It is alot easier than you may think. Create your own unique shape to your liking. E.g:
https://www.motionboardshop.com/pages/how-to-adding-w-concave-to-your-longboard-deck
https://stoked.la/blogs/how-tos/how-to-create-3d-concave#
https://www.muirskate.com/longboard/products/70919/rogers-bros-concave-implant

**3.8.) Falling**

Got asked to cover this multiple times. Well, going back to what I said above. You need muscle memory and practice. How do I get practice in falling you may ask ? Go gravity skating, get yourself a nice Longboard setup (A quality set up that I would comfortably take over 50+ km/h doesn't need to be expensive, feel free to ask if you need suggestions.) then put on your gear which should include helmet, sliding gloves, elbow- and knee-guards. If you have a bad back or don't mind trading being uncool for safety get a back protector. Nothing is steez or cool or wicked about pushing your limits without protection. Then hit your local hill, if you push yourself you will fall anyway. Soon you will realise that there isn't only riding or face planting. Remember though, trying out new stuff means to have a low centre of gravity, falls don't hurt as much, you can react faster and it is easier. Whatever you do, never try to run it of, never ever. Do not get separated from your board. 

Good tip, get some leather pieces and glue them on your ass. Yes you heard right glue leather on your behind (on the pants of course). So if you fall try to use your puck your feet on the board and your behind as your main things to counter the impact and limit road rash. Trust me having half of your ass covered in rash with gravel inside it makes for a terrible visit to the ER and a real joy sitting in your office chair at work. 

The faster you go the more falling looks sort of like breakdancing or push ups. You want to catch your fall with your gloves so your arms. Never with straight arms, catch your weight as you would from a push up with bent arms. If you can stay on the side of your shoes ( there needs to be a serious amount of friction to eat trough your shoes) and basically hold that push up until you stopped. If you are thinking well I don't ride with gloves, ehm this thread is about high speed skating or exercising your ability as a rider. So you either are near topping out your board 40-50km/h or you are conquering new territory and you don't wear gloves (preferentially with hard pucks) emmm whyyy man ? You wont find anyone beginners or skilled riders in any longboard subgenre that has to do with speed not wear pucks. It is just common sense really and also necessary for intermediate riding for corners added safety or stability and during hands down slides. 
Example from a fall of mine, had more "impressive" safes but this is clearly visible what I am doing and how fast your recovery is. And shows if you are riding stupid and your head is elsewhere and you are to fast for your wheels you end up falling.

**3.9.) stopping/sliding**

So this will definitely be a video, once it will be dry here. Do I need to learn to footbrake you may ask yourself ? Of course you do. I mean if it to steep for your brakes, they fail or you are  gravity skating. Nothing you learn should be done fast before you can reliably brake. Now do I need to be able to slide you may ask yourself. Well this is a jiffy. I would say yes and probably get ridiculed for saying this, so I will settle for the following. If you want to further explore skating, have fun doing it and want to broaden your horizon go for it brother. It is fun, super effective for an emergency stop and gives you so much security. Also in the process of learning to slide you will gain so much. 

I allways tried to get my fellow esk8ters here in Switzerland to join me for a slide session. So let me give you an example of what @Virginator benefited from it, since he was the most recent one. He came with his gravity set up, proper protective gear and we went up the hill with the funicular. We started with some starting exercises that are useful for the beginning of your slide, in which you learn to make a turn in the opposite direction of your slide to prep your body and make the centrifugal force help you in the following turn to release the slide. Sounds super technical but feels intuitive to almost anyone once tried. I realised that he only pushed mongo back up. So I immediately wanted to see his foot-braking. Well everyone who exclusively mongo pushes will have a harder time to footbrake as a beginner since your back foot instead of your front foot got 100ths of repetition in balancing on one foot. But with a few pointers and tips and some repetition he got the hang of it at a comfortable speed. Then we went onto bigger things, sliding. First turning around a fixed point circular in a pre learnt position we practised together while standing still. After 2 tries he was stopping by basically going in a super tight cycle coming to a full stop. Now we worked on weight distribution, actually putting weight on your puck on the street and the feeling of sitting down outside of your board ( we did Coleman first). I went for a ride down and came back, he was still at it, practising. Later in the evening more riders joined, one of which is one of the old brigade. With decades of experience, he is not the fastest or anything but one of the best teachers I have ever seen. So same evening, the dude was sliding. Making us and himself smile. What really hit me is that he would have never ever thought he would ever be comfortable to throw down the whole drop until the sliding spot in weeks. But he did it on the same day, no sweat. He was surprised how much more safe and in control he felt doing anything on a board after that. So all I am saying is that it will give you so much confidence, security and fun while learning. And as soon as you can reliably slide, you leap in progress. It opens up so many possibilities for you.

**4.) presence of mind / thinking.**

This is actually a big point in safety. Most of us do it instinctively but tend to get lazy with years of repetition. What do I mean with presence of mind. 
It is realising the conditions you are riding in :wet, leaves on the ground, crowded, near a park, speed limit etc.
Being aware of your skill and lack off: do not join busy morning streets for your commute as a beginner for example. Realising the driver has no idea is there and outs in the turn signal.Actively judge the surroundings around you, realise what is a risk to you and assume the worst of those risks. You have not a single inch of aluminium, airbags or anything alike around you. So your safety features aside from you skill is your "presence of mind" so think, actively don't go into autopilot on an esk8. You will learn that little kids, dogs and cars react in the most stupid and absurd way and can become dangerous if not paid attention to. 

This is so obvious that some actually manage to overlook this. We all get lazy, I mean a fell on my face going over wet leaves at 40+ on a turn. Of course I saw the leaves, new they were wet but I just wasn't thinking. 


PS: For videos, I got so many hours of footage but don't want to just spam it on here. So, I thought, that you guys decide what the videos will be about. Category's such as falling, emergency stop,foot braking, griping corners come to mind. Reader's choice so to say.

Ya, I've settled on a similar wedging setup as you on my electric. Fooled around with a few settings but ended back at wedged dewedged  front to back. 

In some configurations I got speed wobbles every time I ether applied the throttle hard or let of it at while at a high speed. I still feel the boards inclination to wobble under those same conditions but just a little. 
Seems like dewedging the back locks it up a bit and stabilizes the truck that's under power. 

This set up is supposed to have bad drift characteristics according to the image posted by me. I'm still breaking my wheels so I haven't done any drifting so time will tell. I imagine the back is going to drift slowly.

Playing around with wedges, bushings etc. only does so much try, if your board shape allows to stand over your front truck. Punch wour knee from your back leg into your front leg and move your hips forward so most of your weight is on your front foot. This should reduce wobbles immensly.

How not to fall. Examples

-dont run off
-dont bend your elbows in a fall, just cover your face, then press up after the fall.  your likely to jam your rotator cuffs if you catch yourself at speed on your hands in push up position.. as you'll catch hands, elbows will collapse, jam into pavement and shunt your humourous into your shoulder
-wearing knee pads and going knees first
-wearing hip pads/protection and coming out of a wobble and just leaning back into a Coleman setup to butt slide/reverse crab. 

I'm sure my words don't explain perfectly. But I'm sure a video of falling Technics in different situations would help a few... It helps to practice falling.

alright. Good suggestions.

Though I am not sure about the point of the push up position. Never had that problem, even at higher speeds than 60... To be fair though, since I practice Calestenics my upper body is farily prepared for that. Also I cannot allow to fall on my ribcage or frontside stomach dutue my implants and steel-implants, nnew stomach, fixed diaphragm etc :slight_smile:
But yeah, think a safety focused skill introduction sounds awesome.

Depends on how you get launched off the board...if you go up before you go down.. it's something I've only had happen on esk8...  As esk8s can abruptly stop and launch you up and off. Never had it happen to me on an analog board...Basically what I'm saying is if you have a random mechanical failure and you were carving and now your in the air just protect your face and catch yourself at head/shoulder level...don't stretch out like Superman and catch yourself with your hands above your head... Sorry push up position was the wrong term

Alright, weather has been better over here. No longer meters of snow. So this weekend will be a lot of skating. Will definitely record, so if you have any request for me to cover let me know.

What I want to go over is:

- How to get in to sliding: the 3 steps.
- upper and lower body stability
- how to take sharp turns
- balance
- falling
- safety gear

PS: Since I will be recording I will be doing all of that on a gravity skate. Since I don't want to film my own felony basically. Since its harshly fined over here. :slight_smile:
If I can outrun them I am all for it, but mostly for eas of mind for the rest of the group.

Hey there @michichopf mars from down under here. Just wanted to say thankyou for your safety advise. I had a bit of an off today not fast maybe 20-25 km faster than I can run lol

Not sure what happened it was gusting maybe 20 knots I was riding on a club bike track good surface, the next thing I know I'm stepping off the front. Luckily I went straight into a tuck and roll.


I was wearing my **Dragging Roo Hoodie** thanks to you.
It took all of the hit on my back and body a scrape or two on my helmet, took some bark of my hand.
I'm 59 so I did well. 


Thanks man I owe you some beers.

Since I had a malfunction with my receiver wire, it cause my to loose signal durring a full throttle launch and made me fall really bad. I have not been able to full throttle any board because of the fear it will happen again. 

Now I have a stupid powerful build 4wd 6374 and I found my self not being able to full throttle again. It feels like I regressed to when I first started riding Esk8 

I guess only time and reliable boards will fix this issue lol

Exway X1 Pro still broken?
I'm not gonna lie, after seeing several posts about people flying off boards I've been afraid to ride my X1 Pro. Does anyone know if Exway has been able to fix this bug or whatever it was? Has anyone gotten thrown off their board after the latest update? I'm just trying to get into the eskate life without dying. [Nox](https://downloadnox.com/) [VidMate](https://vidmate.onl/)
