Hey guys, just wondering if anyone has made an electric scooter before and could spare some knowledge. I've made a electric skateboard before so i have a little bit of knowledge of whats needed but for this school project its just im a bit lost. Im looking to get the following out of it; 35mph top speed, 20 miles range, 25% hill incline. I have some parts already should i use 12v batteries?? If someone could help list all the parts i might need that would be awesome!
Thanks Henza64

You could buy a petrol one and convert it to electric,I looked at doing it a while back but never got round to it.
I've had both petrol and electric ones,definitely go lithium ion or lipo,lead acid 12v batteries weigh a ton and your need at least 3 of them!  
I was looking at converting a desert storm as it's a beast,you don't want anything flimsy reaching over 30mph, here's a picture of it..

No doubt you can pick a used one up quit cheep now!

The desert storm actually runs off belt drive and the engine moves back and forth to adjust belt tension making it ideal for an electric conversion.
The chassy in the middle has a hollow compartment where your lithium/lipo pack can be stored as well!

Just the other day I was looking at this https://m.aliexpress.com/s/item/32693358462.html?spm=a2g0n.search-cache.0.0.25f6f20a9lxJbV

Hub motors seem to be standard, three phase wires and 5 for hall sensors so they could run on a Vesc. I have a micro scooter that might fit that wheel.

Scooters just have too many parts... I bought this one for $600 from Alibaba + $185 shipping Fedex. And unlike skateboards -- which I don't think are super popular in Asia (maybe Japan), scooters have steep competition and they are really good at scooters because that's like their car!

I don't think you can build something of this quality, with machining, etc that has the look and features as those produced in Shenzen.

Previously I had the tires under-inflated so was only getting 30-35mph.... now I am getting 45mph+ on straight away.

I bet if I replaced the battery pack with better 18650 cells I could get to 55-60mph. Single rear wheel hub motor...

Do you reckon if i bought a frame already premade for an electric scooter then all i would have to do is put in the electrical components??

@Henza64 I wouldn't use that motor unless you either build a second support bracket to support that shaft, or modify the motor so the shaft sticks out the other side. I'd look into a 80100 from alien power systems or similar, they're much better suited to the job without mods or extra work.

As noted previously you will need 80mm motor and not sure if measures have to be taken for the cooling of the esc. Hub motors will not be sufficient for sure.

Also, with that much power going to a single motor, you really need an upgraded vesc. Either AXLE, Ollin v1.1, vesc6, stewii's 6.4 based vesc, etc. A regular 4.xx vesc just won't handle it.

With some cooling even the 4.xx will be enough.

Maybe it is the speedometer but I go 25mph on my 12s4p dual motor Trampa carver and this feels significantly faster even just by my butt speedometer if you are saying my speedo is off ... i will shoot video of it.... once back from Thanksgiving.

How else can i measure the speed other than the devices speedometer? I am going to ask my friend  to drive my car and we will see if it's 45mph.

Use a Spedometer app on your phone.  They typically use GPS for speed averaging, but its still pretty accurate.

It depends, can you get one that does what you want, within the budget you set for it? If so, get a premade one. If not, I'd look around and see if you can find a frame with all the features you want, and mod it. Making your own frame would only be a last resort for me, since that's a whole nother level of engineering compared to skateboards.

The essentials are of course motor, batteries, controller. Both the motor and controller can be be beefier than on an esk8, since you have something to hold onto. Batteries can also be larger, which will allow more power and range.

You won't need a remote/radio/tx/rx, since the throttle can be hardwired and mounted to the handlebars.

Will one motor suffice? how big should i go and how much power should be nesscary to have a 20-25km range? and 50km top speed?
```

## \#25 Posted by: MysticalDork Posted at: 2017-11-28T05:46:04.802Z Reads: 158

```
With a big enough motor, one will be more than enough. I would go with a 6374 at minimum, and the sky is the limit from there depending on how much power you want/can handle. I think a 8080 or 80100 would give ample power (>5KW). Range and speed are all about batteries and gearing, not motor side (within reason.)

I assume a scooter will have lower efficiency than an esk8, just due to the (presumably) pneumatic tires having higher rolling resistance. ~500 watt hours should be enough for 25km, even assuming half the efficiency of a typical street esk8.

As for top speed, it all depends on your gearing. Yes, motor KV and battery voltage count too, but those usually get decided on early, so the only thing that's easy to change is the gear ratio.

@mmaner can you tell me the name of the app? This is for my scooter... so it doesn't have sort of UART bluetooth module to send data. I downloaded `Speed Box` for IPhone but it doesn't record top speed you have to be looking at the screen.  Know anyone that records?

I use an android phone, so I don't really know.  But there should be a lot of speedometer apps available in the apple app store that will use your phone's GPS to calculate speed.

Well it felt like i was going a lot faster... speedo said 42mph... reality... max was 27.2mph on the gps app.

So it was most probably giving you kmh and not mph then. In that case speedometer seems to be accurate

look up "servo tester" on ebay

it converts a potentiometer (throttle) signal to PWM signals (wireless remote transmitter for vesc)

You can hook it up directly using the ADC app

Thanks man but sorry for being nooby,so i dont need servo tester ?  And the « adc app » is a app on the store :stuck_out_tongue:  ? I saw few people mentioning «adc pinouts » is it the same as the receiver pinout on a vesc ?

@epss4 please do not necro a dozen threads asking a question that has already been answered.


The VESC supports throttle inputs as long as the throttle works at 3.3V. This is done in vesc tool by setting the app configuration to "adc" and connecting the throttle to the appropriate pins on the VESC, namely the ones labeled "ADC1" on the manual that I hope came with the VESC. Red goes to "3.3V", green goes to "ADC1", black goes to "Ground" or "-". The VESC should also have these labeled in silkscreen.

If not, or if you are not using a VESC, use an arduino nano to convert the throttle signal to PPM. There are numerous tutorials on the internet on how to do this. You can also do this with a VESC as well if setting up throttle input in the VESC is too cumbersome.
