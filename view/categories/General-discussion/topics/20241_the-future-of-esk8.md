Will esk8 take over regular skateboarding or longboarding? 


Go!

no way! but maybe they will eventually merge into something new.

its another discipline: street, vert, park, pools, downhill, dancing, cruising, esk8, (next thing)...

Well...for now esk8 is the next big thing....

So, do you suppose that after a while, because of esk8, skateboarding/longboarding will loose its appeal? People just skipping the basics and jumping  right into esk8?

this is already happening for sure, I always tell people that are interested to get a longboard and learn some balance for safety. 

But esk8 is weird because it can be used as an actual vehicle, a lot of people seem to see it as that, like a bike/car alternative. so in the end its bringing more people on boards.

its also a much different price range from a $100 longboard to a $600-2000 esk8, so not as much market overlap.

I think a huge factor will be battery tech and hub motor tech... as we have all seen. Things just seem to be getting smaller and smaller. Maybe soon you can't tell the difference between a normal penny board or an esk8 penny board. Maybe a stretch... who knows.

Also, I definitely do see a trend with the older guys (me included). I don't know abt you...but I sure see a lot of Middle Aged white guys on YouTube, riding on an electric skateboard, taking to themselves...So, not what you would picture as a skateboarder/longboarder type. 

So, who's getting into esk8 these days? I don't think most kids got a grand or two to blow on an esk8.

I'm one of these. Me and my two friends into this had zero experiense about skating or longboarding. But i've snowboarding since i was kid. 
We bought longboards first and while we waited esk8 parts (a month or something) we did practice basics of longboarding.

another decent jump in battery tech could change a lot of things!

One of my favorite things about esk8 is that there is no one type of rider.
but early on its a lot of older guys (ex skaters) and rich kids because of the price.
But so many options now....and prices are falling near the "nice" road bike range.

I really see esk8 as its own thing. You can try to do tricks with a smaller esk8, but it seems unwieldy. You can go fast like a downhill longboard, but not AS fast. Then again would you want to? I think of esk8 more in terms of, as much as I hate the term, "the last mile" of transportation. I want that to change. For example, I want to esk8 to work, which is 3 miles away from my home. At least 50% of the ride is uphill, and I am 205lbs/6ft tall. Cost increases dramatically for a functioning esk8 for larger people. which I see as a big barrier to esk8 becoming more mainstream and not seen as a toy. As battery tech improves, ESC/VESC/VESCX tech improves, and motor tech improves, I really think esk8 will bloom and become more of an "alternative energy vehicle" than a hobby or a toy. At least that's what I hope will happen.

sadly - government policy will play a huge role in the future of eskate. Poor li ion publicity will put pressure on governments to dictate terms to us, as will accidents. Always assume drivers can't see you.

Which ever way this mode of transport (which is how I see Esk8 growing) goes I just hope it is welcomed in the same way cycling is. If the positives can be sold in before too many negative stories happen then we could be all good. Not sure if segways have paved the way or the negative coverage around the batteries have hurt more.

@Norco I wanted a Segway when they first came out....till the one day I was driving on Houston St. in NYC, stopped at red light...and this dude came rolling by on a Segway. I went from...I want one!..... to looking at this "tool" riding a Segway and saying to myself..."Man I'll look like an asshole riding that thing." Lol üòÇ 

Sorry you made me think of that lol

It doesn't take too many of those sightings to put people off for life. 

Lover or a hater Casey Neistat put eSka8 firmly in the cool camp for many.

I am dad of 2 and in my 30s - I'm not building this to be cool but to have a more fun commute than everyone else.

Lol...I hope I didn't sound like an ass ...

But I get the appeal from a novice point of view...one thing anyone can't really deny that it's automatically DOPE the first time you see one. And great you have friends that are starting out with you as well...spreading the esk8 love ‚ù§Ô∏è 

The learning curve is not that steep in esk8 which is another reason people skip a step...because I doubt very much you went down a hill at 20mph when your were practicing the 'basics'. 

And so another question... is learning the "basics" even necessary? Is kicking the same as esk8.? Should there just be "basic esk8 101" for future Esk8ers?

@Wubbalubbadubdub I think it kinda started that way. Or I like to think of it as "the great excuse" to legitimize a motorized skateboard. But no doubt there are plenty of esk8 commuters out there...but I'm gonna bet that the weekend thrill seekers out number them.

What would rain on the esk8 parade? Is there something that we could do now to effect a positive esk8 future? 

So I hear regulations on our boards and how we ride them... 

Should we have our own standards? Should we have our own guidelines to govern ourselves?

  I honestly think as soon as someone can nail a modular approach that works well and isn't truckloads of money you will see a boom in esk8 and it will transform into a (more) mainstream mode of transportation. Unless you have disposable income or are a eski building enthusiast, it is difficult to break into the market without seeing good expensive products like the boosted, enertion, evolve, mellow etc, and then hope that questionable products like benchwheel, koowheel, genesis, landwheel (all the wheels really) will work well, and it is a mixed bag. The alternative being diy, which costs time.

  It is difficult for someone like me, with a more than full time job, a family and a dog to get into esk on a budget without sacrificing time with the fam (or more importantly, the dog) to try and figure out vescs and bmss and motors. 

  I think there are a lot of people out there like me; who either get burned once and say forget it, or just don't get past the "that looks cool, but impractical/not worth the money, time, etc."

That's fine. We just had almost same conversation with my friends. I have been always very interested about longboarding, but it's a bit boring at flat area with few short and narrow steep hills. 

In my opinion these "basics" are nessesary. It good to know how to handle wobbles and how to brake if you electrics fail. Or how to crash to the ground orthodoxly because i had no brakes at all in my first board.

When the my office board (Acton Blink HUB) broke last week, I was glad it was the hub board since I was able to kick it back to the office. I forgot how great skating manually was, it's been 15 years since I've really skated. I don't think eks8 would ever replace or take over skating and longboarding as they are a different kind of adrenaline rush.

I hear ya. I started this "hobby" only a year ago a little after my daughter turned ONE. I only worked on the boards at night after my wife and daughter falls asleep and have very little time for long rides with play time and play dates on weekends, I do love getting my haircuts though, My barber is 5 miles away, so that's a 10 mile trip every 2-3 weeks. With the CarvOn V3 coming soon, I'm looking forward to the next build in the middle of the night.

The future of ESK8 is a thumb remote with OLED display. *cough*

A deck that houses all the components. *cough*

Maybe a direct Drive System? *cough*

@Michaelinvegas I don't think the simplicity and appeal of regular skating will be *replaced*  by esk8, but there is definitely a complimentary market emerging. I see lots of folks that we wouldn't normal think of as "skaters" getting into esk8 for the fun of a surfy commute or a high-speed thrill they can't access on a normal board.

The future of e-skate..

4 hub motors with AWD, fully streamlined battery, waterproof, and shockproof

Imagine what happens when people starting taking electric boards off jumps. Think skateboarding + motocross.  It's only a matter of time until they are robust enough to handle it.    e-skate on a halfpipe?  

High speed track racing?  Speedboarding is a terrible spectator sport. So take away gravity, add powerful motors, and put us on a track. How awesome would that be?  I know plenty of speedboarders who'd race electric skateboards at 50mph+

We should defintely lead rather than follow on this. All boards sold with a helmet, a guide of how to ride amongst pedestrians and traffic maybe? A "don't be a dick" guide to eskate to minimise bad publicity and injury.
Also a good idea to familiarise yourself with your local laws.
[Queensland skateboard laws](https://www.qld.gov.au/transport/safety/rules/wheeled-devices/skateboards/index.html)
Definitely don't want to end up classified as [a personal mobility device](https://www.qld.gov.au/transport/safety/rules/wheeled-devices/personal-mobility-devices/index.html) 
Just reading this legislation hits home that we ride in a grey area and it's a privilege not a right to eskate.

Ahhh...but as you can see...regular skateboarding falling by the way side in favor of Esk8. More attractive to non-skaters. Why would they go back to kicking?

they haven't stopped kicking yet :slight_smile:

I think that for now cost is going to be the limiting factor, a decent complete park deck or longboard can be found cheaply. 

I agree, however, that if we see supply increase and cost decrease, eventually there will be a larger convergence!
