Basically every build ever, except mtbs
oh you were thinking of a skateboard deck, not longboard lol nvm

in my oppinion, too short, super small trucks, no option for big wheels

Yeah I did for my first Board. It sucked. Partially because it was my first board, but there’s also a lot of problems inherent with using a street deck. 
The trucks are not good for mounting a motor
There’s not space on the trucks for a motor mount and wheel pulley
There’s no space under the deck for electronics 
The board is heavy which defeats the purpose. Good luck doing an Ollie with a 10 pound board. 
Do 1 board slide and your electronics are ruined

Guess it's not a good idea with 7inch trucks on a street deck either... :laughing:

Time flies. Been quite a while since this was posted. Does anybody know what @RunPlayBack is up to nowadays? Seems like he's far from the activity level he once was on here :cry:

He's still active on IG and has been doing a lot of tech and video effects experimentation. I'm fairly certain that A2 esk8 doesn't formally gather any longer.

You will get jolted back every time you let go of the throttle, not worth it. :japanese_goblin:
Balancing was almost impossible for me.

Can you please elaborate? How is it worse than a penny?

I also had a nasty fall on a street deck in my younger days, but was really looking to get a short street deck cut to put some big Calibers on.worth it?

Reminds me of a deck made by I forgot the name brand (a known one) which is a weird hybrid.

Like you cross a street deck, cruiser deck, pool deck and you add extra length at the rear for rear truck, so the tail can't be Ollie (it serves as support for downhill). Short and fast deck, looked good in video. 

Rings a bell? Might be to your taste.

It's awesome, too

I think the [Genesis Stinger](https://ridegenesis.com/products/stinger-electric-skateboard-orange) is a cheap hub-motor version of a park deck as well.

I put this DIYeboard kit on a cruiser deck. I ended up removing the risers as they where not needed. Just have to be careful about foot placement when breaking. Board tends to want to push your weight forward when breaking and that causes the back wheels to rise up.

I built one with an 8.5" bamboo deck but mounted the trucks on the tails instead.

Meant to be my milk run deck so nothing overly fancy.

Guess it works, but it is harder? Maybe not for beginners with little to no experience in skating?

Its hard for me to say, I've used short decks since the 80s, you do have to tighten up the back truck to handle speeds but the wide makes this much better to control than you'd expect. 

I wouldn't let someone ride this if they had never tried skating before, but then again I'm way paranoid about unexpected people hurting themselves on my decks :)

I can corroborate that -- the instability caused by short wheelbase is mostly rectified by having a 10" or wider deck.  This is one reason I love the Powell-Peralta 1980s reissue decks for esk8.  And the shortness makes for SUPER-EASY carry if you put a handle on the front, under the nose.

So how fast can you ride with this deck?

I haven't had them over 22mph, but ride that fast on them all the time with no issues at all.

I made sure to use 44 degree calibers on mine so the steering angle is much less...this way it feels more like a longer wheelbase..depending on what trucks you use, you can make it much more stable by de-wedging the trucks to make them turn less...the short wheelbase is enough to make it very agile, but with lower angle trucks you can turn on a dime still and then go 20+ mph as well very stable...but as someone said above, this style of eskate isn't for beginner skaters, the feel of a short wheel base is that of responsive quick action and it will buck an unsuspecting kook in a heartbeat..while experienced skaters will love that you can both turn and go fast, and of course while powered this is even more enjoyable...

This is one I made awhile back, ended up giving it away to a kid who's dad I worked with.  Little bastard was doing manuels within minutes of getting on, figured he needed it more than me :slight_smile:.
