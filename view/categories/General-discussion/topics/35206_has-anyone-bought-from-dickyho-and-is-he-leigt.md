Hello

(sorry dickyho if your reading this I'm sure your legit and you seem like a nice guy)

Has anyone bought items from dick yo, If so is he legit? I'm sure he is I don't mean to offend anyone but before I buy expensive items I need to know if the seller is legit.

Sorry again dickyho i know you have great positivity on eBay.

Thanks, guys.

most of the ebay sellers do sell legit parts, but its more than obvious that they will be clones, other than the esc's

All you need to do is use Paypal goods and services and you will have buyer protection.
