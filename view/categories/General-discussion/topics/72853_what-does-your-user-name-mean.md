I didn't find a post on this. But I got to wondering after the Vegas event, what is the origin of your username? what does it mean? Obviously some are pretty self explanatory. Other's like @Psychotiller ...like WTH? Was he some sort of maniac gardener?

I'll start. Obviously my name is Michael, Mikenopolis was the name of my city in the SIM CITY games as a kid and it kinda stuck.

My original online names were SAPIPA, that came about when a friend in class asked me repeatedly what SAPIPA was, it turns out she was looking at my ADIDAS backpack upside down. Had to change it to Mikenopolis because people kept calling me Sap which was weird.

I've had this username for over twelve years in various places.
I used to listen to a a Finnish industrial metal band called [Turmion K√§til√∂t](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eN1Q6VbFLEk&list=PLwAFR6Sz0Sz4jtlg-TOD6JBkyVBUAodnu). I started using one of their albums title as my nick online for some reason. Apparently it's also an asylum where all the dangerous crazies get locked up. I was a teenager back then when I picked this.. :sweat_smile:

I've been trying to slowly "rebrand" myself online and move away from Niuva, but I've kinda stuck to it.
Most non-finnish-speaking also can't pronounce it.

Years ago, I had a few motorcycles. Favorite bikes were  Suzuki TL1000r's. ![Tiller%201|300x195](upload://zyp6OpzMf5lzoJ12pBGBS6zzybs.jpeg) ![tiller%203|477x500](upload://1dBsERYKGTS2rEl9W3avkd7fqaj.jpeg) ![tiller%202|546x366](upload://8BHINLexuXAjhVkAtUmIcje5SAJ.jpeg) 

We hit track days and rallied around the local canyons here. People called the tl1000r's Tillers. Eventually, while a song played in the background of a pub, somebody said "PsychoTiller Kiss Kissay"
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlWZFxCQ0uk

And my nickname was born. 
A couple of wrecks, near misses, and children and I decided to sell the bikes and start building something a little safer Bahahahaha. And Behold!  Here we are.

took a trip out to PNW and it...altered my perception.  as someone from the east coast first nations people dont really exist anymore.  we have statues of lenni-lenape but thats about it.  but to see the first nations people, meet them, changed my view or things.  did alot of reading about first nations myths and legends.  visited galleries and museums to see first nations art.  vancouver was awesome.  stanley park and the museum there (forget the name) was awesome.  drove the olympic peninsula and visited the temperate rain forests.  saw st helens and mt rainier.  my stepfather (a vermonter) refers to me as a 'flatlander' cause im from jersey.  but seeing the cascades, a landscape and ecosystem so completely different...it changed me.

lately i actually feel bad taking the name akhlut.  ive done nothing to earn it.  kinda like a rando white guy who likes polynesian culture using a handle like 'matau' or something.   but its kinda stuck, so i should own it.  i am the akhlut.

But I really prefer this meaning:
Ares and Mars were worshiped for their battle skills. The people of all beliefs including Norse, Greek, Roman and Australian had one god that was a ruthless killer. They were named gods of war but also some were named gods of battle strategy. Mars and Ares are both the gods of war.

mine is a rather lengthy story, but here goes nothin... 

So i went to catholic school up until HS, until then everyone called me demonboy because my eyes are ALWAYS dialated (side effect of being ADHD due to chemical imbalance) so my eyes always look black. cool right?

well since 5th grade i decided to follow Buddhism (because of a girl, naturally) and around 7th/8th grade when her family finally accepted me being around they started taking me to vietnam w/ them and i started to pretty much live at the temples there, learning a lot about the faith and meditation and what have you.

so this goes on well through hs and my best friend (We'll call him Dave) who i have known since i was in 2nd grade and first came back to the US, got it in his head that i needed a new nickname. w/e... so Halloween rolls around Sophmore year, i'm dressed as The Crow. Where i lived tho, we had a problem with juggaloes (ICP fans) and this group called JH (Juggalo Haters)

well i was walking to my girlfriends house (same one from 5th grade) and this group of 3 JH guys tried to jump me because they thought i was a juggalo due to the clownish paint that the crow wears, ima spare the fight details, but i managed to get away w/ 4 broken ribs and got to my girls house where dave, and our girls were waiting and he took me to the ER (how i know about the ribs) (dave had the vehicle since he was 16 and 1st to get his license)

so we get there i get told that i have 4 broken ribs and need 3 stitches on my eye brow (have bomb ass insurance from my dad at that time so i paid the 25$ co-pay and hounded the mail after school for a week to intercept the insurance letter) any who, they do the x-rays and all their stuff and we drop the girls off at their places and we go to davids. I start to meditate.

i meditate and fasted for 3 days and eventually lost consciousness because i wasn't eating and that was the longest i had meditated to do what i'm about to explain. So david upon coming home from school realizes he cant wake me up takes me to the ER and they put an IV in my arm and i eventually come to confused and the same dr from a few days ago comes in and has a look of shock on his face (like hes about to lay some heavy shit on you and doesnt know how to tell you) so he comes in holding xrays (apparently i was conscious once before then, idr it but w/e) and says idk how this happened, in all my time practicing medicine i've never seen deep tissue bruising heal in 3 days time, let alone broken ribs. these xrays show signs that your ribs WERE broken... but look like an old injury. 

so i'm leaving a lot of details out for the sake of the already long length, but since then Dave has called me Holyman and so has everyone else in this small ass town lol

**EDIT**: and 92 is just the year i was born

There's so much strength and energy to gather in faith and meditation, even if it sounds weird or stupid by occidental POV. Same with chi exercises in martial training, sounds like BS till you experience with your own body and open your mind enough to learn. 

Got happy reading your experience man. And those jerks from back then need to see what's coming to them.

I actually thought about my username way too much back when I made it in... 2004?

Obviously its a reference to making chainmail ( I hope its obvious ) But its not like chainmail was this huge hobby I was neck deep into or anything, but more than other hobbies it was a kinda unique-ish thing I did.

I wanted a name that was identifiable, recognizable, and unique. I even went to the trouble of googling to make sure "Chainmaillekid" didn't have any hits.

I went with "chainmaille" instead of just 'chainmail" to be less ambitious

I chose Kid as a suffix instead of Dude or Man or Master because I thought it sounded better, and I didn't want to seem authoritative.

And its always all caps as well. CHAINMAILLEKID

About 10 years ago I used to play GTA 4 (yes 4) online on the good old xbox 360. I was one of those kids who was running a modded copy so I was trolling around and I ran into @ThermalM16. He decided to freeze the lobby and the way mods worked you couldn't freeze out another player with mods if you both had them configured the same. We started trash talking and became friends. I eventually got my then account banned from xbox live for playing gta5 2 weeks before release. I decided at that point I was gonna troll Kevin and make my new tag Thermal something or another. I went with ThermalChild because child was one of our insult/greeting/ I don't respect you enough to call you by your name names. This tag has stuck with me for about 6 or 7 years now.

fun fact: I actually tried the chips fried in olestra, and the 'anal oil leakage' was much worse than it sounds. think of how much the smell of gear oil will permeate a place, and replace the scent with that of drunk street taco shits.

What am interesting thread, here is my small username story.

In 2005 I started a new chiptuning company which became pretty popular locally, the company was called Euroboost because the main cars I worked with were european domestic market ones, such a VW, Audi and Seat.

This was the logo I created:

![704518_442450115821674_624888120_o|690x235](upload://zSpaXUfbK2e6NVXBelyyz8l1A28.jpeg) 

@eBoosted is how people used to call the cars that have been tuned by Euroboost back in 2005.

The company still tune cars today but it was fusioned with my current carshop, we now work not only with chiptuning but everything mechanic, electric and electronic related to racing and street. The company is called Eurotek Motorsports.

![Eurotek%20Color|690x350](upload://sHDgrTBQGKK2bTSuSp3OklFNYu.jpeg) 

We kept the colors as distinctive and also the first part of the name because we still European brands oriented.

4 years ago, I fell in love with this hobby/addiction and after looking those awesome Boosted Boards, I signed up on the forum as "e = electric" and "boosted = powered". Later I created my first enclosure inspired on them with the help of @jackw the designer.

never held on to one nickname for very long on the internet, one day decided to just stick with one, so I found the word "Resonant" it is usually taken since its a plain one-word username but I usually vary it slightly one or few letters to maintain the word if you manage to fill the random letter blank. I thought it looked cool, simple and wasn't hard to say/read/type.
