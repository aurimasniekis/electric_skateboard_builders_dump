They sold 700k but actually they didn't Cash out all of it. They didn't tell about the investment. 
Sad anyway. Profit always outshines ecologism. 
Let's look at the bright side of life. They made a better world while getting rich. All those sk8 sold prevented a big bunch of car commutes.

This technically isn't possible without China producing cheap parts to fit a student demographic tight budget. Their boards are only $599. I think their profit is $200 to $300 per board if you were to base it on the cost of the Meepo board.

It's kinda weird... they sold 1500 units and I had never heard of them. Not that I know every board on the market, but at 1500 at least people would have mentioned their name once or twice.

I'm going to assume they sold that many at a small handful of universities or high schools, to a large number of students at each one.  Possibly just one high school and one university...  Just a guess anyway

I think FabTrav (YouTuber) might have made a video on a board by Lectric. I could be totally mistaken tho :joy:

They realistically made 40-50k each. Maybe. Then there's going to be warranty's and returns. Lectric? Personally, I haven't heard anything of them aside from this video which plays like campus propoganda.

@Martinsp I think you need to re-read the thread dude.
@NAF is not claiming to be _Lectric_
he said:

and you?

[quote="Martinsp, post:8, topic:35707"]
I think that what you say is not true, I highly doubt that you ordered parts for all of these 1.5k units at the same time, got a quantity discount  and therefore there is no way you could get to the 700k mark
[/quote]

@NAF is just sharing a video he found dude.
as for you, apart from being offensive:

Omg. This was the company I hated because their first board was a shitty board they were on instagram selling them to “kids” for $400. I kept warning those buyers that they were POS boards. lectric blocked me after a while because they advertised that they designed and engineered the whole board. 

I literally have the founder’s (Levi?) college business project plan that said they were getting the board cheap and reselling for profit. melon board was the exact same. Business class planning

sure seems like you are talking to NAF, and you didn't mention _"the company"_ but mentioned his post and tittle. Maybe you should edit you post if your meaning is not your written word?

Cool, thanks for sharing. I would also be interested to find out what their typical customer might be. 

At least looks like they are rolling grip tape themselves on the deck and checking that everything works.themselves, too.

It looked like they are using ebay esk8 substitute esc / the one that meepos.boards also tend to.use.

---

Would be cool to.find some.more media / info like this about other "esk8 producers", the only other one which comes.to mind are the inboard when they debuted.on.shark.tank,.maybe evolve shares some info too about their.inside.processes but.other than that not sure

[/quote]

I had a bunch of people messaging me with questions about the 1st gen boards when I was warning all his potential customers. I asked everyone of them their age when answering quesions (seems a bit creepy) but most were 13-15. 

I told them that Lectric was selling "Chinese Clones" that can be had from Alibaba for about $300, then I told them about all the rebands of that board like the Backfire Falcon, Melonboard, LecDec, Luoov, etc. There's a "Dr.Circuit" guy on YouTube that blew the ESCs of these boards quickly, but swapping to a VESC made it a good board. So I told all the kids about that extra $100 they will need to spend at some point.

Well, thanks for in-detail info. Was an interesting read. 

Well.. from business perspective, they sort of has 'beautiful vision''.. then again, im not sure how much power these little hubs motors have, so would be interesting to look into how many people have had problems with the motors/boards so far.

On a side note, found an interesting board  - STARK. Has it been featured on forum already?

https://youtu.be/TyRnUa7sgRk?t=3m37s

Looks like there might be some explosion of eboards soon.. already have seen endless varieties of boards on amazon..

(you can skip back in video, to see the wheel @ diyeboard is selling / using.

i've already built an endless variety of boards in my garage. 

All of these koowheel clone knockoffs from Shenzen are good for business. They get people interested then they get bored and come find me. Or they want to mod them. Or they have obvious flaws that can easily be fixed and resold *cough EXO cough*

I think what bugs me the most is that more and more i see things that are less and less skateboard and more concept or next gen or vehicle. 

i'd like to see more skateboards and less weird future shit. Shit with weird tires and handles every fucking where and covered in lights and made out of carbon and alien cunt hairs.. i want to see more maple and thane out there, maybe get back to some roots. idk just pondering the universe and shit.

I want to see a plethora of boards out there which is what we are starting to see now as it grows,some people want handles or bamboo flex like boosted boards,hub motors etc.
Personal I prefer no flex and belt drive but every one is different,most people dont want the same thing everybody else has.
Cheaper boards are a good way for some people that are starting out,personally I sat back and read up on this forum waiting for components to get better and made my purchase but I wanted two things,reliability and speed and that's what I got building my own!

we don't have the finger sensing controller anymore --> we have our own ring to control the board. Oh just wanted to say that we have maple decks.So, not everything is future shit but sometimes you have to think further.
