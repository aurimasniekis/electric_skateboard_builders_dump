I just got my New Older helmet in that I ordered!  I have to say I am very impressed with this company.  They offer a range of different helmets you can choose from. Once you decide on the style of helmet you want, you can customize the color and whether or not you want matte or gloss.  They will even print a custom picture on your helmet at an additional cost, you just upload the image to them.

Each helmet is made to order but it only took a few weeks to receive it. This is not a long wait considering it was also being shipped from Brazil and I am in the USA. 

Here are a couple pictures of the helmets my daughter and I picked out. Remember to always protect your head!

@topcloud I'm super stoked!  Thanks for adding the link to their website, I totally spaced that in my original thread.

@DilatedPupils I've only ever worn my husbands Vector helmet. The New Olders has better air circulation and hole vents for your ears so that you can hear better.

Any info about impact tests?  Downhill mountain bike ASTM F1952 like TSG Pass, Zero Gravity Vector, or Triple8 Racer?  CPSC?  I didn't see anything on their website and helmets.org doesn't list them.
