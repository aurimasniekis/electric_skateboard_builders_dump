Very durable-- its fibreglass.

**Interior** aprox: 61x15cm  | **Exterior** aprox: 66x20cm.

Its decently long, so you can comfortably fit a 12s4p, full size bms, and your focboxes.

Not sure if it's worth it to just make a kydex enclsure instead, the only cons of just using eboosted's would be fitting and customizeablity
