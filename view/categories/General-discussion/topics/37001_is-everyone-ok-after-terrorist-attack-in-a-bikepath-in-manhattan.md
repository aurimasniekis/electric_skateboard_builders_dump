Yeah, this happpened on a stretch of the Hudson River parkway that is a daily ride for many of the NYC esk8 crew. I was riding there just a few hours before this happened. Tragic, but do not know any victims and none were esk8 crew.

My friend was 4 hours away from this and he has a boosted board for his NY college campus. I asked him as soon as I heard this news, thankfully he was fine.
