Donâ€™t see them on their site anymore. Iâ€™d also be interested in bindings that are easy slip in and out style like the freebord

11/26.....just bought a set on their website

Freebord doesn't like us so won't well the bindings anymore. @okp  is working on an alternative.

Freeboard binding suck anyway.
My buddy accidentally launched his Trampa under a car with the bindings and bindings just bent and snapped off if it can't stop the small mass of the board how is it gonna stop a person lol

Lol I donâ€™t think they were intended to stop a board when colliding with an object though.

I had them for a while on my carver.. Honostly they were that bad, but standard trampa binders were better.  BTW if you think you are going to be able to bail out out easily with them... well that wasn't my experience.  The binding will press your foot down on the grip tape and lock you in.  You pretty much have to move your foot towards the center of the board to get out which is probably an action thats hard to pull off intentional when you are about to fall.  They do look cool though

I am surprise with so much hate about the Freebord binding.
I've been riding freebord for years now (shit, is it a decade already?), and I love them, at least on a freebord. It's easy to jump off, okay you first need to practice a bit, first back feet than front feet, but I never heard anyone in freebord that got stuck into them.
Also, you need to constantly put pressure on them to keep them on the right place. But freebord is definitely more of a sport than esk8, and it's actual effort to stay on it.

Anyway, to answer the question, where can you find them, look at the European shop for freebord
https://www.freebord.ch/product-page/s2-bindings
or
https://freebord-germany.de/index.php/produkt-kategorie/komplett-freebord-set/teile/bindungen/

Otherwise, Spin makes binding that grabs your feet a bit more, but I've seen accident in freebord with them where people couldn't jump out. I couldn't find the shop, but that's what you should look for that

I don't think anyone hates the freebord binding, but there was a fallout between freebord and Esk8.  Btw.. Spin Bindings looks great.  I can't find them on google do you have a link?

Yeah, I saw about the heated discussion. I was a bit sad to read that from the guys behind of my favorite board...
For the Spin binding, no idea. I knew some guys that had them years ago. But indeed, I can't find them online anymore...
The brand was called spin, which doesn't help to search!

Make the baseplate out of aluminum and Iâ€™ll buy another set. The steel baseplate are overkill and heavy.

My set came with all of the screw holes just wrong. I went to my local hardware store and they didn't have a single screw that fit. The screws that came with it were sized/threaded completely off. After fixing that the bindings have been great! Fallen a few times with bindings on and no problems, have just slipped out.
