Hello everyone,
I am having this annoying high pitch whine whenever I hit 20mph on my eMTB after I get to about 25mph it will stop and be smooth again but I ride a lot in this middle range. My setup is 12s with FOC boxes @CarlCollins . 190kv 6374 from @torqueboards and 1:5 helical drives from @Nowind. Can anyone shed some light on how to eliminate this? My switching frequency is 30khz but it wasn‚Äôt any better at 20

Edit: sometimes it is very smooth into and out of the whining but other times the sound hits a brick wall and just stops on a dime

I've had something like this with one of my APS motors, the outer ring and a couple of the magnets had partly come loose and were creating a fairly ugly whine in a certain RPM range. Maybe try figure out if the noise is coming from a specific motor and if so, pull the motor apart so you can inspect the magnets inside the can

Yep, loose magnets are most likely. Check the windings as well

Edit: loktite 648 should take care of it

Damn. Ok. Luckily I got some green loctite sitting around so I will try to fix this tonight. Just put some loctite on the magnet and then place it in the can?

Is there a quality motor that doesn‚Äôt have this issue? I have seen way too many cases of loose magnets recently

@torqueboards what is the problem/ solution here? I can‚Äôt see any obvious loose magnet but this wear is all the way around both the stator and can

@trdolan03 - You'll probably have to send that one in. Consistency on one of our latest batch hasn't been great on our 6380 Black. We have some new ones in production but won't be done until next month. Send us an email and let me know your @trdolan03 so I can remember this issue.

I still haven't isolated the actual high pitch noise specifically though.

100% not, they sound (I mean they don't sound :laughing:) equal no matter which speed.

This is for shure the motor. This whining sound reminds me on faulty APS 80mm motors which people posted. I know exactly how you feel now, chin up bro! I am also still searching for a reliable motor which holds longer than a few weeks, it's really frustrating.

These motors in general are made for hobby RC models and not for human transport I think this is the main problem regarding safety and reliability.

how about your sk8? still goes strong or already gave up?

@Ethel Yours could of been the same issue. I think you emailed us can you PM your email?

This 6374 motor cannot be service by you. I‚Äôve ran it over 100s of miles, used the shit out of it. It‚Äôs not fair. I am going To test my new still in box  black 6380 motors unless you think I should swap them? 

Edit: oddly it did start to make noise when I updated Vesc settings to new FW and increased my motor max for MORE POWER. Could be coincidence

@Ethel You can still send it in and we can try if you want that is.

When did you get your 6380s? You should PM me as we seem to be having an issue with the 6380 Black for our last batch (retainer rings loose). We have some new ones that are in production with the issue fixed. We should definitely get yours fixed. It can be fixed by resealing the retainer ring with epoxy.

@Trdolan03 @Sender @Skunk @Ethel Yeah, obstructed C-clip is an issue typically more so for TB Mounts. This is mostly for 6380. The cir-clip is meant to be flushed but I believe, we needed an extra 1mm for 6380s so the cir-clip sticks up a bit. Could be for other setups but I'm not 100% sure, you'll have to check. You just want the cir-clip to spin with the shaft and not cause any added friction if it's stuck on a mount or what not. This goes for all motors too and can cause the "noise" you are experiencing @Trdolan03 (one of the reasons).

The fix for this would be to add M4 washers on the motor mount to gap about 1mm so the cir-clip spins with the motor shaft. See video below. I believe, this is what's mainly causing the retainer ring to be pushed out.

Although, this isn't the fix for ALL "high pitch whining noises". This is a possible solution for one.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjuMGeQHeLg	6374 6380 Motor CirClip

@Trdolan03 - I'd gap it 1mm and try it. You should be good by then. If not, let us know.

@Sender - Mostly, on blacks it seems but make sure that your cir-clip isn't obstructed. But yeah, we got you covered just let me know and I'll take care of you either way. If you want to double safe, you can add epoxy on the retainer ring but I believe the issue is caused by this cir-clip issue.

We tested like 20+ motors and for 6380s they all had this high pitched noise/resistance and the cir-clip was the culprit. Once we added the M4 washers to gap it 1mm. Everything was good.

@Skunk - So far everything seems to point to the cir-clip. You can purchase now or you can wait for the next batch which has fixed this issue. Either way now or later we got you covered.

@torqueboards I'm having a high pitch issue as well on one of my two silver 6380s I just finished the build this morning running the motors on Kaly gear drives.  I have 3.5 miles on the motors.  First 2 miles were good.  Then high pitch noise at higher RPMs.  Lower seems fine.  There is a little bit of bell housing movement vertically compared to the other motor.  The high pitch begins when the RPMs cause the bell housing to move vertically.  Only moves maybe 2mm but just enough to so the sound is real bad.  It even sounds like the bearings are grinding.  Sent you a contact support request earlier today.

@torqueboards BTW I tried to install washers in between the motor and Kaly drive mount just in case and in my situation it didn't make a difference.  The sounds is sound bad that I am afraid to ride my board.  I sent an email response about the video link that Derek sent me explaining that the solution did not fix my problem.  This is a huge bummer since I only was able to ride the new build for 3.5 milles (2 miles were perfect).  It's killing me not to be able to ride my new build.  It's like Christmas morning but I'm being told i can't play with my new toy.  LOL

@Trdolan03 that's a loose magnets had been listening to this noise for like a month so I know for sure. If you remove can it looks everything fine as magnets sticks to the enclosure so it doesn't move but at higher speeds magnetics get bigger and magnet starts lifting up from the enclosure and it causes small vibrations. 

You can take a flat screw driver and try to push under magnets some of them will definitely will lift up :)

@Trdolan03 All the magnets you can actually remove. They aren't glued to the motor can. You can secure them to the motor can but make sure not to use too much that it adds to the thickness of the magnet otherwise it will rub against your stator.

Yeah, If you can wait. I'd suggest waiting for the new retainer ring. PM me your email so I can get those new retainer rings out to you. You can go ahead with the repair if you have issues afterwards just let me know and we'll take care of you.
