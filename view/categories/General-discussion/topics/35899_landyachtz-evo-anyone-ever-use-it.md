Im thinking of getting a Landyachtz Evo or an Landyachtz Switch 35.  I really like the Switch 35 better because of the size but the concave on that thing is insane.  The Evo is kind of big for what I like to ride but Im thinking the cutouts will make it feel smaller.  

Has anyone out there in the land of rocket powered murder boards ever ridden one of these?  Alos, are the cutouts large enough for 6in (6 shooters) numies?  Whats the deal with the weird ass angles on the cutouts?

I thought it looked familiar...  @chaka, any insights on whether 6in numies, AKA @psychotiller 6 shooters will fit on this deck without modification?  And what are the weird angles on the cutouts about?  I assume its a "more stable at speed" kind of thing, but would love some clarification.

Almost 98% positive my six shooters will fit this deck with 200mm+ trucks.

Im rethinking the spud 29.  I don't think I can make the surfrodz, even with 80mm axles, work.  The risers would need to be massive to avoid wheel bite.

Yeah the negative angle on the rear will make the trucks more stable. Where the positive angle up front adds a bit more turning ability to the front trucks.

If you go with the Evo, make sure you run a 40° baseplate up front, or something similar. If you run a stock 50° plate you are going to want to dewedge, or it will feel terrible. No lean and your bushings will feel super hard

Well that sucks, I already have the trucks :).  I guess I could use a flipped 10 degree riser and achieve the same geometry?  I'll admit, I had to lookup 'dewage' never heard it before, always called a reverse wedge in podunk Alabama :slight_smile:.

Years ago I bought an evo and enjoyed it a summer. I had 83 mm wheels and cast ronins on it. It was a speed machine with the turning radius of a bus. The steering is super indirect and the rear truck has a minimal steering angle. Quite cool going fast, but I didn’t like it for sliding. It makes similar sounds like an Evolve while sliding. Very unattractive imo.
Switched to an Topspeed with the same trucks top mounted. It was much sharper and more agile.
I haven’t used the evo since switching because the topspeed is more fun to me while doing downhill.
Imo the Evo could be a great eboard for commuting and ridicules speeds.

Ive got a top speed, love the deck.  I just want something that I can use with 6 shooters that will stand up to some punishment, but its gotta have a decent turn radius.  Did you change the geometry at all?

Yeah that will work!  Excessive wedge angles can be tricky but are totally doable.  About 10° on cast trucks shouldn't be a problem at all.  With precision baseplates, anything past 5° can be annoying to get mounted.  The key is getting your bolts to bend slightly, or modifying the deck a bit to accept the angle.  I'm actually running a -17.5° custom angled riser on my e-sk8 with precision plates; I had to put a drill bit in the truck holes and cock it back to give them an angle, so the bolt is perpendicular to the angled plate

The wedging up front on the Evo is +15°.  With 50° Calibers, that would put you at 65°  (gross!).  The deck was actually designed around the old Randal DH trucks (35° baseplates)

I prefer 50° up front, but 47~52° is a good angle in my experience

@mmaner
I have one. I'll be posting my build soon after I finish redoing the enclosure and battery. It's an excellent ride. Steers like a car (by that I mean front steering). Very stable at high speed. And with the perfect drop, you're nice and low to the ground. My enclosure is 3.5cm tall and there's still plenty of clearance. Was a little tricky fitting dual motors because of the deck/drop curve but it's worked in the end.

This is also an evo deck. I hit 49mph on it with stock 50 degree baseplates, still felt very stable compared to my other boards at high speed. I have 35 degree randle baseplates on it now and its a lot less turny but still more than agile enough for me and rock sokid at high speed even with the bushings pretty loose. Where did you find the deck for $100

I'll try it with 1/4 risers and then change out to wedges if I need too.  I've got a set or Paris 195s and a set of surfrodz 177 with 80mm axles, not sure which I'll use.

My Evo is on standard 50 degree baseplates. I was a little concerned because I bought the trucks first before I new I wanted an EVO. I'd also been reading about what is a good truck angle and thought 50 might be too much. Having said that, I think 50 degrees is perfect. You don't want to fiddle with it too much otherwise it defeats the purpose of having a wedged deck.

I ride all my boards over Street bumps everyday, there's no way I stop get off my board, lift it over it, drop it on the floor and continue riding.

I do it on my Vanguard, the Bintang and even the Evolve Bamboo GT with oversized battery pack, specifically with this Evo it would be almost impossible without scratching the enclosure

@pshaw Caliber 2 trucks with 50 degree baseplates plus 15mm riser pads. Although risers weren't necessary. I only had them to make room for the motor wiring. TB mounts too. Although I've changed the set up. I'm now using Evolve trucks and 107mm wheels. Still building it at the moment.

Still using risers although for different reasons. They're wedges.  When supercarve trucks are on an angle (ie. Because of the Evo deck) they effect the height of the deck. What was happening was the front was really low and the back was high. It looked cool and handled ok but I was sure how it would affect it long term. So I had to de-wedge the front and back.

 Built this for a local college kid.  It hauls ass and looks amazing. It’s just got that “step aside” attitude and the kid can’t stay off it.  I raised it an inch and wedged out the Torque 218’s to almost 0 (level) and it actually more or less carves pretty decent.  I’d say it’s a winner for building. ![image|666x500](upload://kJ0XNpQT23UuKNxA9wcXsCbr8pe.jpeg)

Hi Loppy,
Can you please list out how you made this! Are those 6374 motors? 

I'm planning on buying Torque Boards Pro3 Conversion kit. I want to know how to mount that under the deck? Would I just need risers?
