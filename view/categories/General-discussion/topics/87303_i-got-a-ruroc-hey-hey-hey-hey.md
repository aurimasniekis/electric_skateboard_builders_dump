As far as I have heard, you are completely correct...

Pretty sure the bottom shell is just plastic, so it won't protect your chin...

They do have a motorcycle range

But most people tend to be using the snow ones instead. Suppose how good it is depends on if your comparing to proper full face helmet or vs something like a skate helmet. I'd guess the snow ones are better than a full open face.

It may be a snowboarding helmet but it still offers protection. A few people have crashed with these on and been relatively fine in terms of head injury.

The chin guard is plastic but seems to be tested to pretty high stength. This is just a case of something is better than nothing. 

Tested (might be bias) Starts at 1:40
