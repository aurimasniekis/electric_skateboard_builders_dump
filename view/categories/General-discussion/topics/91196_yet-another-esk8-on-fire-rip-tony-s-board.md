Well thats terrifying. Was this board homemade? Or prebuilt? And what battery did it have?

Damn makes me so sick to watch. I wish we could see the battery to try to catch what went wrong. It‚Äôs always great to exploit potential issues that cause things like this. Shouldn‚Äôt have watched this right after eating.:face_vomiting:

It hurts,.. but made a mistake by added better Reinforcement inside CF  enclosure which left me a tight fit, casing one of the cell to vent ..

The negative casings of different series cells are self short circuiting as well, it's because the second negavtive is connected with the first's positive: so negative-positive short circuit

This is why everyone is insisting on fishpaper between p-groups.

^THIS. I recently had to rebuild my 10s4p pack because I didn't realise the importance at first. Did you have fishpaper between your p-groups @Touch415?

Everything was insulated inside, that tight fit once bolt down was the end of it üòîüòî rode it for 200 miles before with no issues the reinforcement inside didn‚Äôt go well for her at all ..
