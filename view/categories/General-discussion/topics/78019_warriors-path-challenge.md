@Arch @JohnnyMeduse Yo!!!!! HEY!!!!!! WTF!!!!!! I was the only LaCroix board to finish the Warriors Path Challenge this past weekend in NYC(57 miles).... I have a new understanding of Volt Sag now.... Please for the next iteration of the LaCroix Board take these things into consideration...

**1)** Charge time needs to be 2.5 hours (I had to wait 4.5-5 hours to get to 95% charge for the last leg of the ride which was 15 miles and I barely made it...
The last 2 miles was 10mph then 5mph then 1mph...

**2)** Battery has to be 12s - no more 10s 

**3)** Only 1st 40% of a fully charged battery is really usable then the next 40% goes into boosted board mode then might as well kick push... This needs to be remedied... I got passed by a boosted board and an evolve bamboo GT...  Totally embarassing..


**4)** The Lacroix board is now being called not LaKwa but LaSag...   
I had to get towed by other DIY boards (that were fine) on multiple legs of the 57 mile course. This board cost way too much to have such a shortfall/drop off in performance. The combination of the above issues makes the board only good for 10 miles or less IMO... I say this because if you do more than 10 miles then the volt sag will kick in and the required charge time to get back to usable power will be pushing over 2 hours.

**5)** And yeah put a battery/charge meter on this thing!!! 

All of the above has been learned from Real World testing not some guesstimation... Yes it was cold outside and yes I weigh 225lbs but on a bright warm sunny day I doubt if I can get a good 20 miles out of my DSS50+ and of course that's with a full charge and not speeding... and like I said who wants to wait another 4 hours to fully charge again?:unamused:


Peace...

Just wanted to point out that you can buy a faster charger if you want and use it right now. You can get an 42V charger(if its 10s) and charge 5-6A or even a little higher if you don't care about your cell life.

Also, If you switch over to some 100mm BOAS, or 107/97mm flywheels((like the boards that were passing you) you will get at least 40% more range and I promise they wont pass you... You will just pay for it in ride quality compared to the aired tires.

In an earlier post it was recommended to not use a higher amperage charger


1st board that passed me repeatedly was a Boosted V2 on 85mm Caguamas
the rider had two XR batteries and stopped to swap once one ran out...

2nd board was an evolve bamboo GT on evolve 80mm tires - every now and then 
I would see the rider kick pushing up a hill due to volt sag but he eventually would
pass me on the flats...

I know about the added benefits of switching to thane - However the DSS50+  
and DSS60 are suppose to get 
 
* **Longest range in class**  - up to 60km/37.5 miles (DSS50+) and 50 km/31 miles (DSS60)
 and approximately 33 km/20.5 miles (DSS60) or 40km/25 miles (DSS50+) in high speed, 
non-energy saving, steep uphill climb, fun riding, Ludicrous mode conditions.

* **Fastest e-board**  - recommended speed is 30km/h to 35km/h (18mph-22mph). But if you’re in a safe place (e.g. an empty parking lot or race track), bend your knees, get low into your big wave stance, engage your abs and prepare for 54km/h (33mph). Both DSS50+ and DSS60 have the same acceleration, same top speed and the same weight. Only the range is different.

* **Fast charge**  - approximately 3.5 hours for a full charge.


I've achieved none of the above...(except for 33mph) not even 3.5 hours for a full charge...
If it says 37.5 miles lets cut 10 miles off due to my weight... so 27.5 miles - mind you I'm
not a speed demon at all...so lets cut another 5 miles off so 20-22.5 miles not going fast.
But you're suppose to get 25 miles going all out...


As I've said before I'm lucky to get 17-18 miles in perfect sunny warm conditions...
17-18 miles is less than half of the advertised 37.5 miles 
17-18 miles is less than the all out ludicrious mode of 25 miles
17-18 miles also means 4.5 - 5 hours to a full charge again

To add insult to injury there was another 2 riders each with DSS60 models
both weigh around 125 pounds... both ran out of battery as did I on the same
stage of the ride. One decided to get a tow and ended up colliding with the 
person towing him. An Uber trip to the hospital for x-rays and a possible broken
hand ended his ride. The other DSS60 rider jumped in an Uber and went home
after eating... which left only myself to make it to the finish. And finish I did
moving at 1 mph for the last 8 blocks. 

- Peace

@BOOSTEDO YO! JEMAL! WTF! (this seems to be the common greet, I'm just trying it out). Glad you enjoyed the event!

So in a nutshell - you engaged in a 100km race in sub zero conditions and got lapped by unmodified Boosteds and Evolves? They had more range than you? dID tHeY LeGAliZe wEEd iN nYc aS wEll?

I kid man, not everything in there is utter nonsense so let me address some of what does make some.

- 12s battery; our engineers were and still are adamant that unless I wanted to pivot into being an ESC repair company, there's no way you can currently sell a production board on 12s. Half of them will come back with blown ESCs. They know because... they've repaired 1000s. On a production board (hundreds and then thousands of units), you can't max out the components - you'd be playing russian roulette and be swamped under warranty issues. I'm glad we listened - 9 months in, we spend our time building boards, not repairing them.

- As for your new understanding of voltage sag, with all due respect, I'd still keep digging my man. This is a good explanation (https://electricbike.com/forum/forum/knowledge-base/batteries-aa/48140-voltage-sag-explained). We're not using li-ion shit pouches that sag out the box like old donkey balls. The packs we use (60 cells of 30Q and 50 cells of 20700B) are legit the best packs out there to inherently minimise sag. 

This shouldn't be a surprise but... our boards are set up for _max battery pack life_ - _not max range per charge_. We set the soft cut off at 34V and a hard cutoff at 29V. It's the optimal setting not to have to dish out hundreds of $ every year to change your pack. Is this the optimal setting for winning a 100km race in the least time possible? Certainly not. 

My trampa urban carver diy built last year has a 12s4p (30Q) that would do 20 miles on pneumatics on a full charge after I built it. At the end of the season last year, I could hardly get 10 miles out of one charge. It was set for maximum range per charge, not max battery life. And it's been collecting dust for the past year.

If you don't care about voiding the warranty and optimising your pack's life, there is plenty of info to do that... wait for it... on this very forum. 

As for what we advertise, I'm very comfortable with it. Some guys have gotten 40 miles out of one charge on the DSS50+ and some guys reached 39mph with it. Our advertised numbers are below that - they are conservative. 

Finally, when you emailed me back in June, you seemed to be aware that your specific specs (weight and riding style) had an impact on the advertised range of the board as you wanted to make sure the board "can get you a good 20+ miles". I was comfortable when I said yes. Jemal, we don't sell fine wines. It doesn't get better with age. You can't expect it to have better range now than then. In freezing conditions. After riding it for 4 months. 

Until we grab a beer again, keep on (t)rollin' bud, 

A

PS; pretty sure you're packing more than 225lbs fully clothed with gear and a charger in your pack - closer to 250 IMO. Prove me wrong and I'll send you 4 tires :stuck_out_tongue:

This was the chuckle I needed to get my day going. Almost spit a little hot coffee out.

I personally am getting about 20 Miles per charge out of my new DSS50+.

Hard carving, full speed, at probably 165 with gear.

Nothing I have ridden can match the feel I get when I'm on this board. I have a SEG (shit eating grin) every time I step on this thing.

Couple that with the fact that I thought I screwed my board up completely and @JohnnyMeduse not only helped me out but literally took 30 minutes out of his day to connect with me and get everything sorted out. 

BEST DAMN INVESTMENT I HAVE MADE IN A LONG TIME!

LOL!!! You can keep those stroller tires and understand 1st and foremost that this wasn't a RACE!!! It was a RIDE!!! I have only ridden my LaKwa about 20 times in the past 4 months... and you totally forgot about the other two DSS60 riders who complained about volt sag and gave up. I SAY AGAIN NO ONE WAS RACING!!!!! It was about conserving and testing yourself against the elements... 

**FACT:** I have not been able to get 20 miles with this board from day one...


**FACT:** I still use my BOOSTED BOARD V2 as my everyday board and only ride the LaKwa on the weekends after realizing it can barely get me to and from work... (remember I had an issue with my remote)

**FACT:** I cannot Ride to a meetup from my house in the Bronx to Manhattan because I would be at your premature cutoff/Sag Zone and it would take another 2-3 hours+  to get back to a full charge... 

**FACT:** You need some new Engineers... IMO

**FACT:** I DON'T DRINK

**P.S.** Show me any non-child/non-midget human being that has gotten 40 miles out of a DSS50+ and I'll start DRINKING...:stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

**P.S.S.** No one is trolling you this is actual feedback from the field... If you can't take constructive criticism then you should go back to where that midget esk8 riding DSS50+ rider who achieved 40 miles stopped and ask him/her if they're done charging yet!!!:thinking:


Peace...:v:t6:

Hey @Arch, I’m the organizer for the event, I want to thank you for sponsoring us, it was really epic and the fact that you took a leap of faith on being our first sponsor speaks volume of your support for the community. Since i’m a DIYer I want to share my perspective and give some technical details that @BOOSTEDO don’t know much about. 

9 riders clear the 57 miles event. Surprisingly, all 9 boards are completely different in terms of specs. 3 urethane boards, 1 unicycle and 5 pneumatic boards.  For the sake of comparison let’s throw the urethane boards and unicycle out of the equation because it’s not fair to compared them. 

So here are the 5 pneumi boards with their respective gear ratio and battery set up;
6 inch pneumis 1:3 13S6P Flipsky 6
6.5 inch pneumis 1:4 12S10P FvT esc
7 inch pneumis 1:3 10S6P Focbox
8 inch pneumis 1:4 12S4P Vesc 6 iteration esc
8 inch pneumis 1:4 12S8P FvT esc

As you can see, there are a wide variety of pneumi boards that day that made it to the end but @boostedo LaCroix came last in the last 15 miles of the event. Please don’t misunderstand, I’m not saying that LaCroix batteries are made differently or that the packs are subpar, I’m merely telling you the fact that the other boards finished the event earlier than the LaCroix by a wide margin, at least 20 mins ahead. 

Obviously 12 or 13 s battery pack will always pack more punch than 10S, but @BOOSTEDO believe in the LaCroix brand and wanted to Share his experience with you so that you can make adjustment in the future. Let me know if you have any other questions. I’d be happy to share it with you. Again, I want to thank you for sponsoring us. I hope to see you in NYC soon!

Hey @Nate, thanks for your kind words - I had a great time in NYC a few weeks ago and the riders down there are really fun peeps. Seems like your event was a smash - congrats.

Good info about the finishers - none of which seem out of the box production boards, amirite? Taking for granted those are all top notch builds all using the best cells and dual 6374, then there are only a few true variables ; tire pressure (as @Mobutusan pointed out), ride style, voltage cutoff and rider weight. For this discussion's sake, let's assume the 2 first are identical for everyone. Leaves us with cutoff and weight. 

For voltage cutoff, i know understand @BOOSTEDO considers it "premature" - these can be changed at will. Will totally void the warranty but if you want to max out range, you can go right ahead. Will kill your pack way more quickly tho. Can't have it both ways.

I can most likely guarantee our cutoff settings are considerably more conservative than any DIY which, by very definition, generally want everything maxed out. When you have a spot welder and know how to use it, swapping packs every year isn't such a big deal. Vast majority of our clients don't own one and can't be bothered with building a flexible, reliable, safe, battery pack. We made the bet that they'll trade maxed out specs for longer ride life. We use the DIY mindset, but don't take the DIY risk.

For rider weight, I guess that's one **FACT** we won't be getting from our anti-midget engineer-bashing root-beer-sommelier :rofl: KIDDING MAN DON'T GET TRIGGERED AGAIN!

Point is, I'm still glad our out of the box board was able to compete with all these DIY. Just to be in there is a badge of honour for us with our 50 cell board amongst boards that all had more cells (some more than 2x the cells) except for one.

As for criticism, I'm the first who wants feedback. But constructive criticism (battery indicator was one) shouldn't be mistaken with accusations of false advertising. I welcome the former everyday of the week, the latter not at all. 

:v:

Voltage sag occurs when a battery is under load and the battery recovers from the voltage dip (hence sag rather than voltage drop or decline, it goes down then back up like a sagging line hung between poles).  The amount of sag that will occur in a given moment depends on how many amps are being drawn from a given cell and how quickly the chemistry in the cell can "balance back out" to the original voltage (ions have to flow from one side to the other).  When the voltage is sagging the max RPM is reduced because the RPM is determined by the voltage times the kv rating for the motor, so the long story short is the more you are on the throttle/more amps you are pulling the more the battery will voltage will sag while under load and the less punchy the board will feel.

Another kind of restriction that is set by the end user on the speed controller is a low voltage soft and hard cut off limits.  When the speed controller gets to the soft 'cut-off' it really just starts reducing the max amperage it will deliver so you get reduced torque/acceleration such that the battery can go a bit further, once you hit the hard cut-off then no more power is delivered to keep the cells from going over the 'voltage cliff'.  Different from voltage sag but partially related in that a cell could be pushed under the minimum voltage where it goes 'off the cliff' from 3V or so quickly down to 0V, if a cell goes 'over the cliff' it can never be charged again (or will be dramatically reduced in the number of times it can be recharged after that and runs a higher risk of fire).  Due to this 'over the cliff' and no return most of the builders who want their board to last more than one race (endurance or not) set the cut off pretty high so we aren't really using the full capacity of the cells.

One more thing to add about the whole voltage sag business, when you first get rolling on the board if you don't kick off at all or jump on and get it rolling with your momentum you are going to be pulling a lot of amps just to get moving from 0 to more than 0 static friction is always higher than the dynamic friction and the force required to accelerate something already moving in a given direction is therefore lower.  Once already moving the motors only have to overcome inertia and the dynamic friction between the bearings and the axle and drag from the air and your surface area.

Another thing you might be discounting is the effect of cold on the cells:

https://avidtp.com/what-is-the-best-cooling-system-for-electric-vehicle-battery-packs/

https://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/discharging_at_high_and_low_temperatures

The cells advertised for the DSS50+ are rated at 4Ah per cell and 50 cells which is 50cells x 4Ah = 200Ah and 200Ah x 3.6V nominal = 720Wh.  Someone my size (about 115lbs) can expect to get around 1km for every 10Wh, if it takes say twice as much energy to move someone twice the size then we can divide it in half and say 20Wh for 1km is a pretty safe bet on urethane, so if we take the 720Wh / 20Wh = 36km or roughly 22 miles.  That's assuming pretty ideal conditions and pretty much taking the battery from fully charged to 0 with nothing left in the tank (and a now dead tank).  If you are on and off the throttle constantly this is going to be wasted/depleted energy.

To wrap up there are lots of variables involved your story doesn't sound infeasible to me but at the same time the claims made by the board makers doesn't sounds out of line either assuming you adjust a few parameters of rider ride style (we didn't discuss altitude changes at all) etc. etc. and it could make sense from either perspective.  I understand the frustration with buying a thing that is expensive with certain specs and then not getting xyz that you paid for but at the same time there is a lot of variability here so can't say I clearly side one way or another.

---

PS some data to look at can see when amps are high the voltage line (blue goes lower) and recovers afterward would take this data with a grain of salt it's just some random record I had in browser history from the metr module but in some cases I didn't have all the params configured correctly in there so occasionally some bunk data:

https://metr.at/r/GLCvO

As a side note I think it would be good for mfgs to include this module on the board it isn't that expensive and adds a lot of value in terms of reconfiguring on the fly without a computer and getting data about what the heck is going on.

And I wasn't arguing with Alex I was just giving him some feedback... out of 8 or 9 LaCroix boards that started the ride - mine was the only one that finished...

Owning one doesn't inherently mean you know how it works... 

You are a big freggin dude.  Takes a lot of juice to make you go vroom vroom.

If you knew how it worked you would know that all of these things aren't really issues. 

You would know what a 10s6p can do.

You would know that it is smart to do 10s on a production board.


Though I am sorry you had such unrealistic expectations.  That must be frustrating.

Holy crap I wanted to stay out of this but its so difficult.

1. You had 50 cells, the other boards had an average of 85 cells. 
2. You have a production board set to conserve and preserve batteries for years to come, the other boards were going full throttle balls out proper DIY
2. You're a fat dude, they weren't.
3. Cold
4. They probably pushed off and conserved battery, you probably pushed a burger into your mouth
5. Charging is a simple calculation, want to charge faster? Buy a charger that feeds more amps. Rocket science.
6. You came onto a DIY forum and passive aggressively attacked a valued member and didn't expect this?
7. 90% of the users here know how absolutely stupid your statements are, don't argue until you have done some basic study.
8. You made me type this all out, mong.

I think the charging time discrepancy is due to cell balancing. Most people think that a 5AH charger can charge a 10AH battery in 2 hours, and that isn't always the case. BMS usually starts to balance around 4.00V, after that the last 0.2V takes significantly longer(as its balancing the cells)....

Dual 6374 190kv motors with a ~1:4 reduction on 200mm tires have plenty of juice!

You had to be there then... and as I stated before this was not a Race... It was a Ride... total course was only 57miles... if you can get 30 miles per full charge then that means you should only have to charge once fully during the ride... I made sure to charge at every oppourtunity I got and still had to get towed on two occasions. I even shared an Uber with another LaCroix rider (DSS60) for a stretch along the highway cause both of us was completely out of juice. While in the uber we passed another LaCroix (DSS60) that was being towed... (This was the rider that got into the accident and had to go to the hospital) To add insult to injury there was a guy who was kick pushing and he made it to a couple of checkpoints before me cause I couldn't go faster than him kick pushing.

The Ride was fun and challenging... instead of being in front and having to stop at each light on Prospect Ave I would hang back and coast to the light to conserve and try to time it so the light would turn green before I came to it. I did a lot of coasting trying to make it to the end... Being able to get 14-15 miles per charge is a no no because then you will have to wait 4-5 hours for a full charge again to get another 14-15 miles... we only had a limited amount of time between stops...  and that's if you made it there with the pack... so do the math yourself 

15 miles (5hours) 15miles (5hours) 15 miles(5 hours) (15 miles) = (60-57 miles) 15 hours charging!!!

Who in their right mind wants to spend 15 hours charging... hence I got towed twice and took an Uber once.
After the Ride I took a train uptown with two other riders and got towed to my friends car and driven home afterwards. Another rider on a DIY board got out the car at my house googled his location put on his helmet and rode another 15 minutes to his house... These are the FACTS!!!

**Note:** That soft cutoff seems to occur around the 60% mark (Battery) for me... This is boosted board speed 18-22mph max.(You'll know it when you want to go faster and realize you already have the throttle pinned) :hushed:  When the board is dead it shows 30-25% Battery Remaining. This was during August when I first received the board... These numbers are via the Xmatic app which was called TestFlight back in August... I think a lot of people believe they have 50% Battery left when in Reality they have already hit the soft cutoff and are only 20-25% away from being completely dead. Now if the board is dead at 25-30% battery then why does it take 5 hours to charge fully???:thinking:

Maybe my board is defective...:thinking:

This is all very simple. 

A 10s4p 30q pack has 430'ish WH at nominal voltage. At 30 WH per mile at 100% efficiency (I usually calculate at 85) you get something close to work.14.3 miles out of that pack. Remember, that's perfect conditions. 

If you want 30 miles you need a 860 WH pack. If you want to charge faster, get a 4 or 5 amp charger.

Honestly there's nothing to argue over. Either you change soft cutout limit yourself or you get a faster charger. I have mine set at 3V soft 2.8 abs cutoff to get the most of the capacity out of the cells. honesly tho. production board are not made to do 57 miles, and at no point LaCriox ever adviser for that amount of range. If you want that extreme range you should've done the math before entering the Ride. 

I'm running 13s4p 30qs, and gets about 17Wh/mile in BaeSk8 grouprides. so I get about 561.6* 85% (capacity under load) * 85% (efficiency) /17 = 24ish miles per full charge.

So Eric's board, your Bulldog, Boostedo's Lacroix, a Kaly and Edwin's board. Is that right? I'm willing to bet all these except boostedo's have Kaly 6 amp chargers. Well maybe not Eric cause he has a 13s. But like Alex said, boostedo's voltage cutoffs are probably too conservative and his charger slower so his battery pack would be less strained and would take a longer while before having to be replaced. Kinda like how boosted has a 199wh "effective" battery pack when it's actually 200+wh and has a 2a charger when I've seen SF people charge their boosteds with 4a just fine.

Not gonna lie this is a dumb thread. You’ve been told probably what... 8 times. The problem you haven’t isn’t the board you got. It’s YOU, you expected 25miles+ on a 50 cell board running pneumatics. 

This ain’t a great example but I’ve got a 10s5000mah board. It can get 20km if I’m conservative. Now your is what 10s15000mah? So let’s say you could get 60km range. Now I’m on urethane, it’s also known that pneumatic wheels decrease range by 40- 60% so let’s assume you could get 30km of moderate riding. Now my batteries are also set at the lowest cutoff, your are not.

Let’s just leave it there you should be getting anywhere between about 25 - 40km of range, lastly I weigh only 60kg. (Yes, I am one of those midget leprechaun 🍀) 

Basically what I’m trying to say is you should be getting 30km of range or 18ish miles, but you weight almost double what I do, and it was very cold. I think the way it performed is how I would expect

I already said 18mi is what you should be expecting, the other riders could maybe expect another 3-4mi due to being lighter but the main issue is the pneumatic wheels. 

Swap them to 100mm boas and 2.4:1 gearing and see your range increase significantly

LOL waited long enough for you to type. BTW charging half way doesnt necessarily mean half the range bruh. @Arch alreadt said the voltage cutoff is at 34v and 29v. 3.4v per cell is about 30-40% on battery meter so it's not surprised you will feel a lack of speed when you hit 30%.

that explains it. you are riding on the street with street light and you should already know acceleration drain more battery and it put a much larger load on the batteries and therefore more sag (and a big boi like you almost doubles that load). If you go on an open road and ride at top speed (or even anywhere close to that speed) non-stop, i'm not surprised you can get more range.

My biggest thing with this Lacroix is if you advertise 60km/37.5 miles DSS50+ and I say OK let me take 10 miles away due to my weight but actually in reality I have to take 20 miles away which leaves me with 17.5 miles straight outta the box brand spanking new then something is wrong here...

I said the cutoff is actually at 60% battery- Yes 60% and at 30-25% the battery(board) is just about dead... you will not be going anywhere faster than a NYC pigeon walking next to you...  You will feel a lack of speed at 60% battery... As for riding on the street that's not the issue either - I usually take the westside highway path into the city from Dyckman St. all the way down to 125th St... NO LIGHTS!!! Then from 125th to 55th St... NO LIGHTS!!! then from 55th St to 18th Street lights but mainly for pedestrians... and most of this is damn near flat... Believe you me I know the best route to take... 

You're damned if you do and damned if you don't...IMO
The board has the range but the charge time is 4-5 hours for both models (website says 3.5 hours)
Change the cutoff void the warranty: Change the charger void the warranty (and risk the internals) 


P.S. When I said charge halfway - I meant 20 miles worth... I didn't give percentages cause I know how that works... You really have to wait until that light turns green to get the full benefits out of the board.  90-95% isn't worth it... you had better wait for 100% or you will feel the difference in range/power... that might take another 45 min...:unamused:

P.S.S. If Neil wasn't away on vacation I would probably be making plans for the BAESK8 Trip...

The advertised specs are IMO not achievable in the real world. This is however to be expected as with all advertised specs they are up to values and not guaranteed.
The cut off is the standard 3.4V per cell used in the Vesc tool and is IMO the proper setting. If you want to change it you can do so but don't expect the manufacturer to honour the warranty as going lower will degrade the cells faster.
The 2A charger is too small for a battery this big. A bigger charger will cut charge times in half or more without causing any cell damage.
A battery voltage display is a valid request.
You guys are overreacting, most of @BOOSTEDO 's points are valid. That said he simply expected too much from his board.

It's just cells. The same cells everyone is using. Why do you keep saying "x person gets x range!!1!11" 

Every person you've compared to seems to be using 30Q's. It's a battery, they are all the same. It's simple mathematics, there's no voodoo magic in it. Want to ride 57 miles? Plug your stats into the calculator at 85% efficiency, see that you'll need a 4 hour charge half way and get on with it. Don't come here afterwards and ignorantly whinge that a guy riding a urethane board outperformed you after quite literally replacing his battery half way. That's incredibly silly.

Everything about your lack of understanding of simple math and simple production board limitations is hurting my brain. It's **simple**!

Just read through this thread. There seems to be a lot of misinformation regarding lithium cells in general, independent of whatever arguing that's going on.

Firstly, voltage sag is not black magic. It has nothing to do with lithium chemistry or the cells "refreshing" their voltage. Voltage sag comes from ONE specification and that is the cells internal resistance. It can range a lot depending on the cell package and overall capacity.

This is completely arbitrary, but the numbers make sense mathematically. If you are using cells with a .1 ohm internal resistance then pulling 10A then your circuit will lose 1V of "oomph" per series count during that current draw. That's all there is to it, V=IR.

Temperature will affect voltage sag, heavily. A warmer battery will have increased voltage (don't charge your cells while they're cold). If you charge at room temp then go outside to freezing temp, your normal voltage sag (which is linear with current draw) will stack onto the voltage loss from temperature.

Also, changing cutoff voltage will affect capacity. A 4000mah cell will ONLY be able to supply 4000mah if it is fully discharged from 4.2V down to 3V, as per the manufacturer spec. Having vesc settings limit discharge to 3.4 or whatever voltage is reasonable to increase cell life, but it WILL decrease capacity.

In my opinion advertising a pack as 20Ah is acceptable even if the vesc settings do not allow for that, solely because the pack is made of cells that would construct a 20Ah pack purely based on the specifications.

We also need to consider a few things. This range specification is NOT a guarantee. These specs are nothing like a car's gas milage guarantee.

If I'm riding a board, let's say I get 20 miles out of it. I am 150 lbs.

If you double my weight, you better expect to halve the milage. Is that unreasonable? Well, I argue that it is not. If your car was getting half the gas milage then that would be grounds to complain. But here's the thing, in no uncertain terms are you going to double your cars weight. Esk8's are small and relatively light and rider weight heavily affects range.

So a 300 lb rider will get half the range I would. But there's another detail being missed here. Increased weight translates to decreased range, which can be explained by INCREASED current draw. And increasing current draw WILL speed up cell degredation. So overall pack lifetime can be expect to decrease as well.

An increase of current draw will also lead to more severe voltage sag as well, which can heavily affects cell lifetime if it dips voltage low for sustained periods of time. There is a very good reason most mainstream boards have a maximum rider weight.

Just my two cents, take it or leave it. But I've presented everything I believe to be factual.

This thread is like a living, breathing, afterbirth of unmanaged expectations and being upset that physics is a thing.

This is why building completes is such a thankless risky game, in a nut shell.

I'm closing this until @treenutter, @Namasaki, @barajabali or @anorak234 can get involved. This is getting out of hand.
