Well I am not bashing them. 
Iâ€™m saying October 2018 because in good faith I am factoring in that they will encounter some delay but this time will come through and have that delay be very reasonable and commendable. 
Why does the order not match how I entered it?

Never mind. I refreshed and it displays it exactly how I wanted it.

Never mind again. The order is weird when I show results.

This moron is sleep deprived. I meant December 2018 and also meant to vote that. 
I love my 3 months old son.

I originally bought 2 focboxs, then the unity came out on pre-order so I returned the focboxs. It's the first thing I bought and will be the last thing to come :sweat_smile::disappointed_relieved:
