No Frankenboard until summer. Constant rain at lower elevations here, snow in the mountains. Not e-board friendly yet. How many winter climate people on here?

I am wondering how many esk8ers have a snowboard background? Used to ride, still do? Where? Any pics or video? 

I had my old gopro out yesterday, cut together some footage. This is my 5th time up this year, haven't been up as much as I would have liked.

Cool. I have only surfed once, so far. I mean to do more of it. Might do some down in Tofino when I get the chance. Cold though.
Where do you surf? Any footage?

No snowboarding yet but have surfed and longboarded. But it is my first winter in south dakota. Still trying to get used to it. Will be weather proofing my boards tho for the snow and water

Im totally jealous. I wish we had good slopes around here :( 

I grew up a beach boy surfing in the summer with good slopes in the winter up in the north east. But now I'm a few hours from the beach, and no where near slopes... It's how I ended up esk8ing. Started downhill, got tired of walking and pushing, so added power.

Last year was my first time longboard and snowboard. I'm planning to learn how to surf in the future. I live in Virginia so not a lot of good slopes around here.

Started skiing at the age of 3 and moved to snowboarding at the age of 16 when it first started becoming popular. Never switched back.


Only downside. I don't enjoy prepared slopes anymore and the snow conditions these days are rarely what they used to be...+ the prices went up big time.

There's one spot close by. Chance of good snow, maybe two weekends a year. Good for beginners/my wife.

Next hill i have is 45 min drive away - the "Erbeskopf" next to Idar-Oberstein.

I can relate, I was living in Toronto until a couple years ago. I got into esk8ing as a snowboarding substitute. 
Surfing is a pretty sweet substitute for snowboarding though...

I used to snowboard a lot when I was younger. Snow's been pretty shit here for a number of years though, plus my main buddy I used to go up with went full retard and tried to launch himself into orbit and blew his knee out. 

Eboarding's been a great substitute (no paying for a lift ticket anymore). I do miss it though.
