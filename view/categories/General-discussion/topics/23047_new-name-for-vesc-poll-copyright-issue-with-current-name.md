Benjamin Vedder has partnered with @trampa because of the large workload related to making the new VESC 6. Benjamin Vedder has the following trademarks (some are pending):

* Vedder™
* BLDC Tool™
* VESC™ countries outside European Union
* VESC registrations pending for a variety of countries outside the European Union

This unfortunately means that only @trampa can sell the VESC under its old name - it is ILLEGAL for other vendors to sell theirs under this name. So that it is easier for people to distinguish if a ESC is based/ uses the design of a VESC I advise that a new name for other vendors is agreed upon.

Please choose the name(s) you think are best/ suggest a better one below. I will add all suggestions to the poll.
[poll type=multiple min=1 max=2 public=true]
* NESC (New Electric Speed Controller)
* Other (please reply suggestions)

I cannot edit a poll - need administrator permission so will just list below what has come up with so far, then will put in a new poll tomorrow at 12:00 GB time with all the options everyone has suggested (and will have suggested by then).

So far:

* NESC (New Electric Speed Controller)
* VED-ESC (Vedder Electric Speed Controller)
* BESC (Boards Electric Speed Controller)
* ESK8 Controller (esk8.de's self explanatory suggestion ;))
* Open ESC or OP-ESC

       How pretentious are you guys? Do you honestly think that just because you have sole rights to distribute the new controllers that the guys here will be hurt without you? 

"If you wish to contribute to the project, just stick to what will be offered." 
       Are you suggesting that we wait for your instructions on how to better your business after you have stabbed everyone here in the back? My business will never be given to a Trampa product and will solely go to other members of this forum who are actually in it to help each other.

I sat on the sidelines because i am new to this community and believe this community is collaborative and awesome....but with the smoke and mirrors act going on here i could stay silent no longer....below are just my opinions based on my experiences as a former intellectual property attorney....changed practice many years ago because it was soooo boring writing patents all day....

Since VESC is protected by at least an EU registration...and the Registrant now seeks to enforce the rights there needs to be an alternative generic name.....you can not exclude the public from using descriptive or generic terms to describe a product...what would we use?..."the ESC that Benjamin Vedder and the community improved for electric skateboards"??....that's a mouthful......

Remember trademarks are for source identification....not for describing the product....

If trampa et al has a descriptive term they want the public to use instead of VESC then it should be shared before everyone else comes up with an alternative as they might not like what people come up with...because let's face it ESC is absolutely a generic and descriptive term for an electronic speed controller and that is what these are....and adding a V arguably doesn't make it distinctive....imho...all due respect to Vedder as he is a pioneer....

In fact, the almost universal use of VESC for the improved ESC by the esk8 community and the allowance of same until now may have already relegated the "mark" to arguably a genetic status...

Even though registered in the EU  I would suggest that VESC will have a hard time being registered in the US as it is arguably already generic...a trademark examiner at the USPTO will simply Google VESC and see how it is used to universally describe an ESC that is improved for esk8s....

Kimberly-clark had to spend millions to teach the public that it is a "facial tissue" not a kleenex ...it was the first account we had to read in TM class in law school....

Google ...genericized trademark....

I fully believe in protecting one's work efforts...but unless the TM owner either changes the narrative (ie give the public a generic term and encourage it's widespread use) or starts filing very expensive suits...that horse has left the barn.....

BTW I like O-ESC

AFAIK this is not true.
You will be able to get the reference design just like with the 4.12 and you can sell it.
They just want you to name it differently so that people can distinguish yours from a VESC that BV endorses.

It is listed on BV's website http://www.vesc-project.com/trademark_policies_page:
[quote]
 The following are examples of proper and improper usage of these trademarks of Mr. Vedder:

Correct: "your product name" compatible with "Mr.Vedder mark"

example: compatible with VESC® Software

Correct: "your product name" based upon "Mr.Vedder mark"

example: XYZ Controller based upon the VESC® Open Source Project

Correct: "your product name" for use with "Mr.Vedder mark"

example: xyz Controller for use with VESC® Software

Incorrect: "Mr.Vedder mark"-"your product name"

example: VESC® Your Brand

Incorrect: "your product name"- "Mr.Vedder mark"

example: Your Brand VESC®[/quote]

The reason why trampa told you to not use VESK8 is because it sounds very similar to VESC. If you call it "esk8 Controller based upon the VESC Open Source Project" everything will be fine

I think the problem is that for many companies (like esk8) they are selling a VESC, exactly the way Vedder designed and want their customers to know that. The fact that everyone says the VESCs from them are reliable just makes it even more odd that Vedder has not license it to them. 

So either BV will license other sellers (like he did with @trampa) or a new widely-used name must be found for VESCs using Vedder's exact pcb design, but that are not allowed to be called a VESC because of an issue with copyright.

Any business can make fair use of the TM! You can actually use the TM VESC! 

Just read the TM policies with a bit more care.

_My ESC, based upon the VESC(R)* Open Source Project._
_My controller, compatible with VESC(R)* Open Source Software._
_Open-ESC, ready for VESC(R)*-Tool._
_etc, etc, etc._

_*VESC(R) is a registered Trademark owned by Benjamin Vedder. This is his Website: www.vesc-project.com_


Private people can use the TM in conversations (e.g. Forums) anyway.
**Since nearly every OS-Projects has TMs in place, there is probably a very good reason for that.**

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_trademarked_open-source_software

Dig a bit deeper and google _Trademark Open Source_ etc. and you will see what sort of stuff is going on in this world. A TM is the only way to keep trouble away. There is no other way!
Law obligates trademark owners to police their marks and prevent the use of **confusingly similar names** by third parties. That is legislation you can't change, even if you would wish to handle things differently.
Because a TM serves the purpose allowing customers to identify the original source. Allowing an non controlled use, or confusing use would contradict the purpose of the TM. 

I think @esk8 we talked about the matter for more than an hour 6 weeks back and you got a deep insight why things need to be the way they are and why some things had to change, so that a fresh restart on solid legal foundations can happen. Its a really complex legal matter that needs to be dealt with. You can't set up a OS-project without caring about that sort of stuff. Your entire precious house will collapse because some bad minds will identify the weak spot and will pull out the critical brick at the bottom. Its almost certain that this would happen. Project Hijacking and TM hijacking is very common! Spreading malware through Zip files is common, bad code is reality... **A TM is the only way to assure a project can be identified as the original source.**
You can't deny that legislation is part of reality that needs to be addressed. I'm sorry for the mail, I think you just got me wrong. I wanted to prevent that you build up your marketing on a naming strategy that is not possible by law. Think of a wisely picked name and build up from there. Make fair use of the TM! If questions arise, they can be asked. It's in the very own interest and for the good of the Project. Help Benjamin to set up the project on a solid legal foundation by respecting **his** TM policies, stated on **his** website.

Has Vedder licensed the production of the VESC to you (under the name of his project) and will this be licensed to other RELIABLE sellers (suggested by community and approved by Vedder)? This requires a yes/ no answer for each part of the question. 

If the answer to the 2nd part is no, could you please go through all the suggestions for names on here and make a list of the ones you think are too close to VESC and will 'damage' the project. I fully respect legislation, but think that  it will make there be less questions on this forum about what is the difference between x seller's esc and x seller, when there is none. I will be posting in 20 minutes a new poll with the suggestions that you are fine with.

Study for finals for a week and then things like this happen... I think this is really strange, and not really needed at this time. The community know the reputable vendors that they can buy VESC's from, and we know the firmwares coming from vedder are legit, and the rest are use at your own risk. 

At the end of the day, 95% of VESC's sold will not come from trampa. So the community basically pays the price so that Trampa can secure the name and not have to deal with a few potential problems.

But heres the problem: a name isn't going to stop people from abusing the designs, spreading malware, ect. People can still put malware ect. into the firmware, and release it somewheres. You think criminals care about the copyright law?

If your worried about the malware issue for example, have vedder release all the software you need for the VESC through his website, and refer people to only download from him. This issue for example can be solved in better ways that aren't at the price of the community.

What changing the name will do is confuse the community, make it harder for us to talk about the VESC (since we need to refer to some other name that seems like it'll be way longer, based on your suggested use Trampa), and in general, inconvenience the community. I don't see, through your explanation trampa, how you'll secure the project like this. I think we're over that hump in this project to where someone could successfully hijack it. Too many people know the right people in the game to buy them from that aren't ripping offer vedder or the project.

The biggest gain is really Trampa's gain, which is now they have exclusivity to a name the community has used for almost 3 years now to refer to this project. All of the SEO gains of having thousands of pages talking about it, the familiarity to the name, ect, will benefit Trampa, at the cost of the community.

Unless you can show us direct proof that this project is in such grave danger, by showing us the bad actors that want to hurt it, and show that even a bad actor at this point could dismantle and tarnish the project, it seems this was done for monetary gain in Trampas interest. If you want to protect the project ect,, why not give it a new name and protect that? Why upend the community like this? You will piss off (and have pissed off) a lot of potential customers.

I;m no lawyer, but as a Software Engineer, Copyright laws are a pain in the butt, that stifle development and progress. I think if you really thought about this problem from a CS standpoint, you'd see how to secure the project without the need of getting Copyrights involved.

Very well said.  I'm so damned angry over this, I cant even think straight about it.  I'm verey happy that someone with your expertise was able to state in legal sense the happenings with this thing.

EMC = Electric Motor Controller. (Almost like E = mc² :) )

Keep it simple. Todays controllers regulate more than the speed so IMHO we're way past calling it a Speed Controller.

So "**[Brand] EMC based on VESC® Open source project**" or similar.

TEFRV - The ESC Formerly Referred to as VESC
FUKYEA - Fantastic Utopian Killer Yoddle Explosion Apparatus 
SAUCE - Sexy Ass Universal Cruising ESC
CARVE - Colossally Awesome Ride - Ved-dude ESC

And this is the masterpiece:

SEXMACHINE - Super EXtreme, Mad Ass Carving, High Ignition, New ESC - 
well shit now i need to get some stickers made!!:grin: I feel like @longhairedboy might dig on this

What about a recursive acronym [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursive_acronym](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursive_acronym) like "GNU is not UNIX"?

I may just start calling the VESC the FUCKYEA forever now.  I hope you know what you've done here :slight_smile:

i'm not a fan of this situation to be honest. 

They can call it the Holy Snatch Sniffer for all the fucks i give. I'm still calling them 4.12s, Xs a 6s. 

They should have stayed open source. This is bullshit. Somebody better fork it.

It technically is open source ... it is just that only the reference design will be published (like enertion with the vesc-x) and the source code. It happened because trampa is willing to produce low volume, super high quality VESCs (as Vedder wants) and Vedder is not happy with taking the blame for other websites that sound like his. The trademark now Vedder has got it has to be policed and tbh I am glad he got it and not anybody else in the world. I think forking would be a bad idea - the code seems to have been a good year of work and the reference design will be free to download and use.

I don't think it will turn into a MySQL as Vedder seems to be licensing production to Trampa - he can withdraw it when he wants if quality is not up to scratch (though I think it will be).

A major incumbent in the database industry (ORACLE, been around for decades) basically took over the open source MySQL database engine (which is serious shit btw and probably the most powerful relational database there is, and its free, and made Oracle's DB look like the idiot dirt eating kid in the sandbox) and started fucking with it causing the community to create a fork called MariaDB. Lots of people were pissed over the whole thing while it was happening because of the obvious conflict of interest. 

I just sense a bunch of red flags here, that's all. Maybe everything's fine.

otherwise, they are already at phoenix VESC

open-esc.com is already used by Benjamin / Trampa

You must be joking! The Software is Benjamin only and he is the owner of the TM. He is free to drop us at any time. No contract other than verbally expressed willingness for cooperation. HW is not what the project is about. Without the software the controllers will not spin any motor a quarter turn. 

With regards to Forks: Do you think anyone can keep up with Benjamin? He thinks there are only a very few people out there who understand the new code fully.
Do you think its fair to do that? Grab someone else's work and claim it for yourself.... Its one guy behind the software not a community of coders.

And what would the SW do without the HW ? 
This seems to me just a way to divert the fact that the open source of the HW is over. People will be allowed to modify the HW without publishing all the informations of the mods. There will be a reference design but one main article of open source licences is that any change made must be published.

True, but the HW license is not enforceable and not worth the paper its written on. We can't change legislation. So its up to you! 
Hardware is visible anyway and you can reverse engineer it if you wish so. Software is usually encrypted and can't be reverse engendered. That is the big difference between those two. HW can be designed in two days, software needs years.
Benjamin wants to see more variety in future. So the reference design will be a full scale design that you can adopt or change.
Its not "Only a reference design" thing.
Its a "yeah man" design.

(the following sentence is my opinion and it may be wrong)
Well, i can imagine that @Ackmaniac can understand the code completly! He has made so many changes to the Software (acceleration curve, watt control, ...)  which just get adopted in  the vesc tool without any mentions. So yes there are People who are improving the Software.

Wrong. ITs more difficult than hardware because hardware you can just shine over a light and see the traces and get the codes off the components. Software has to be run through a debugger and analyzed and decompiled but the same result can be had. 

Pardon me for having legitimate concerns. I've seen these kinds of deals go bad before.

Sure, but before you came in the game, people were implicitly respecting this rule (publish the changes in the HW). 
Now you basically arrive and say that you will not respect it, but it's no big deal since it is not possible to enforce it. 

You take things the wrong way around !
Open source is very much in the spirit. You may legally respect it (in the words). Whether you are respecting it in the spirit, this is much more questionable. And I have the impression that this is the heart of the problem. People feel (and regarding the HW, they have a point) that you are using the open source-ness for your interest and this is not what the open source has been designed for.
If you were really into the opensource, you would also release all plans of your Trampa-VESC design as this is the rule for an open source project. You say that it is not mandatory and that it could be done in two days ... but you still don't publish it. 
Having that in mind, your claims of beeing the white knight of the open-source and the savior of the opensource future of the VESC project are somewhat more difficult to swallow.

Here's to a brave new world, my friend. 

BTW when these things are finally available I'd like to make them an option for my boards. The idea of a super-hardened off-road ready VESC that can probably also handle the street with grace and attitude as well really makes me happy inside.

i'm going to make one in a mirror chrome finish with black symbols all over it and call it Skatan's Big Balls ESC and have a picture of big red balls on it too. And maybe they also come with some little rubber dangly balls you can hang from the back of your board like they do on pickup trucks.

Akira, we will publish 85% of the design. The 15% missing are the specific parts that need moulding tools, costing a fortune and might be outdated very soon. In the end our PCB layout is super specific to fit in a super specific casing, specific to the mounting patterns we designed for our boards, which are not OS. So maybe its better to publish a PCB that has slots for mounting a random heat sink and having holes to mount it to something. Its always hard to balance things out perfectly, so that everyone is happy in the end. As I told you already, you can share the spirit if you like but there is no obligation. The Open Hardware approach is highly debatable and some have other opinions than you. Benjamin for example has a quite relaxed opinion about Open Hardware. Like it or not. He doesn't give a lot about it as you can read in his statement. He doesn't believe in the "one shoe fits all", nor me. VESCs are found in machines that are not OS and there is a cover over the product development of the hardware. 
The world has maybe seen more than 100 different designs of VESCs and only a few are available under CC. 
So many special applications out there... Who could follow that up. We have seen HEX, round, triangle and double layer designs, with and without heat sink, simple versions and high spec versions, robot versions and skate versions and bike versions and dual versions and balance board versions.... endless. 

If you want to complain about that, you need to speak to Benjamin, who is of another opinion than you.

Hey Frank are you really the brother or sister .... Or friend ??? I think you're nothing of it.
And yet it seems to me as if you were this because you are talking about Vedder always thinks about how he acts and how he plans everything ....... I think you are somebody trying to get money out for yourself and still More advantages ..... And I can not imagine that your suffering is synonymous only to begin with what has to do with Longboard Montainboard or something else has POINT !!!!
