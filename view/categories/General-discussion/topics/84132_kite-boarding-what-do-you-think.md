I know it's not Esk8 related but I ordered a 6.5m kite with 30m lines to mess around with and I was thinking about getting a MBS or Trampa deck to ride beaches.

Does anyone else do this?

Either this or get a hydro foil board

Nope. Not me. I am a sea Rider. Also more experienced at windsurfing. I went snowkiting a couple times tho. Kickass time :metal:

6.5m is a bit small. You'll need a lot of wind... If you're new to kiting I recommend getting a single skin kite. They are safe, easy to fly, and the wind range is great.

I have the MBS Core 94 anf it works great for landkiting.

6.5m kite
[/quote]

Tube or softkite? Bar or handles?

I bought my first mountainboard in 2015 because of landkiting wth 5m² softkite and 9m² tube. For me the 5m² worked well (I'm 74kg) for riding, the 9m² would be good for jumping, too but I'm too scared :laughing:

Where I live (austria) it's hard to find public spots for kiting that's why every second ride someone came and told me to leave otherwise they call police. Almost every place is owned by a farmer or similar. I was tired to be an outlaw and decided to build an electric mountainboard so I can ride whenever I want.

I didn't landkite since 2 years because the wind range is now the throttle of my remote.

But beach riding sounds great, would like to join but I'm afraid it's too far away :wink:

I've got a kite, but I don't think I ever want to pair it up with a board.

If I were to board, I think I'd want to have more control than what a kite brings. If it came to that, I'd just invest into a eboard to ride the same terrain.

And for the kite, its huge. I'm content just flying a big kite with my feet on the ground.
Thats not what its for, but its exciting enough for me.

I have a lot of kite experience. 4m ozone access with a harness is what you want for parking lots. The kite is a 4 line depowerable kite that works the same way that the bigger kites do. In fact i used my 4m access to climb the side of mt hood on my skis when it was blowing 45mph. I also have a 6m access for light wind use with a longboard, or some kind of bigger wheeled board. On the water I use a 14m because I like to jump as high as i can. When you load the kite up and pull the trigger on a jump when you are fully powered up, it is like being strapped to a rocket, kind of takes your breath away. Once you learn the timing, you can do some things with the kite that takes 110% out of the downward force of the landing, and you set down like a feather. Snow kiting is the best form of kiting in my opinion. The feeling of being pulled up the mountain is awesome. When you are fully powered up and have some fresh snow it is so sweet! I use my 14m to cruise around, and my 21m when the wind is light. With the 21m it is so nice to get blown up a hill, turn around and paraglide down, floating around for a minute or two before landing so softly it is like i never left the ground. Kiting is highly addictive....

The 6.5m is the closed cell inflatable kite and I got it more for practice and playing around. I'm using handles not a bar at the moment but I know I have to transition to a bar once I go bigger.

I might end up kite boarding on water instead it's a bit more expensive but there is more open area to ride and the falls hurt less.

6.5m is good, but if you never have played with a power kite you will want something smaller to learn the basics afterwards you can move on to the 6.5m and the board.

I would do it, nothing wrong. as long as there are no power lines around. I've kiteboarded for about 9 years, and have gotten very good(in my mind xD). But since I have never rode a 4 wheel board with a kite it would be a HUGE learning curve, im so use to leaning and especially in light winds if you fall back a bit you just land on the water, no big deal (almost a habbit) but if I did that on a board it would be hitting the ground lol. Might be a painful re learning curve hahaha

But I know a lot of people that do it! man a 6m kite would turn like a speed demon!!

I don't think the water would damage the deck but the surface area is small compared to a water deck

I second this, you can get a trainer kite (usualy have 2 and 3m) they both will pull decent, but that 3m one would actually work with your board in heavy wind

Yeah 
A trainer is the way to go @Battosaii
On a grass field the surface is hard compared to the sand and you need to get experience reading the wind conditions. 

Otherwise It can be really dangerous, not only the hard surface but your reaction to the wind and not letting go, also the lines can present a hazard. 

Check around your area and get a 1 or 2 lessons, at least to know the risk involve.

I too bought handle kites at first. They do not have any depower function, they rapidly went into  the junk pile. A 4 line, depowerable foil kite is the only way to go.

Mine has 4 lines, and I have kite killers so if I can't handle it all I have to do it let go and the brakes go on automatically. I'm okay with the 6.5m I have a open park near by where I can Practice.

No, when the bar is pushed away the kite is powerless(ish), when you pull the bar in the kite powers up.

Oh nice I see on bar set ups with a harness. Yeah I have to get that. I think I'm gonna spend the money and take a lesson to see if actually like it enough to invest in my own equipment. I'll probably love it.

I never took a lesson... i knew i was a kiter the second i learned about it. With a small depowerable foil kite and some safety gear i taught myself to kite on this crazy contraption called a dirtsurfer.

I have an Ozone Manta 2 kite (10m) that I no longer use and would be happy to let go for a small price. PM me if you're interested. Probably only makes sense if you're in EU though.

Thanks for the offer but I live in the US.

I'll play around with my 6.5m trainer and I'll step up to a bigger set up later :slight_smile: from my research with my weight I'll need a 15-17m kite to have fun in light winds. Mostly light winds here in Florida.

Make sure you get lessons, or you will fall into the "Kook" category. Also its extremely important to try not to learn on your own, trust me. what part of fl? its usually light wind in summer, but depending on your weight a 12/14m kite is good nearly year round. 12 is one of the best sizes if you only have one kite, if not maybe a 14 and a 10 and a 8 would be good (3 kite quiver)

true! if you found a huge enough space (empy lot/field or somthing) you could maybe try the 6m kite with a mountain board. But anything bigger kite (where you have to hook to a harness) would def recommend lessons haha GL
