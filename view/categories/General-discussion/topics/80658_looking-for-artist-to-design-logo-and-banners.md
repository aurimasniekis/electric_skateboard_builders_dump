Hey guys!

I'm trying to put together some logo's for my local club and company "The Electric Boarder Colorado" that will be hosting the Thunder in the mountains event. I need to get some posters made and would like to work on a good logo as well. I am more than happy to pay for these commissions. If you guys could send some links to your work, send suggestions of artists you know, I would really appreciate the references. I would love something hand drawn or painted but am open as long as we can build something unique. Get back to me!

You might want to try Craigslist on gig section that’s how I did some graphic design work when I was in college and need some burner money.  I would be willing to help but I am definitely sure that there are far better designs than me on here as I haven’t really dealt with illustrator in a while. But I will help if no one else steps up

I've used [fiverr](https://www.fiverr.com/search/gigs?query=logo%20design&source=main_banner&search_in=everywhere&search-autocomplete-original-term=logo%20design) before and they're good for this kind of thing.

I'm not affiliated with them in any way except a prior customer.

@pixelsilva I could really use someone who could do some sick geometric morphs for animals or able to draw comic book characters would just need black and white for graphics on my decks
