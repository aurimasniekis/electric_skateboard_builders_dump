Best to wait a 6 to 9 months if you want that price to come down.

£11.99 here. Probably can go lower with bulk

Price is still bad though

why should i use them? if they'd have 4 Ah yes, but these are the exact same specs than 30Q beside 35A discharge, i i use 4P 30Q i have approx 80A continuous discharge, thats way enough!

They would be great in a 2p light config

Yes, these cells would be great for a short-range light and small board in very low 1P or 2P depths

Yes, for 2wd, it is. But for 4wd and off road builds, it's not. Which is why it's a game changer for us. But $18 is too much, I won't touch them at that price range right now. When the price gets to $12, I'll buy 48 and make my 12s4p 160 amp discharge pack. Till then, zippy lipos are the only cells that can pack the punch. I get way less performance from my 30q at 80 amp then I did running zippys at 120a.

More like $8 to $10 for the 40T.

The 40T seems like a good option for a longer range and higher powered board. But these prices have to drop... It's just too high to be practical.

well let me get this straight, if i am going for a 4WD build, i would never get a battery under 3P or even 2P like @b264 said.

If i am going for an offroad or 4WD build, normally the pack is 4P and more, which means with 30Q approx. 80A, with VTC6 **(Still much cheaper then 30T)** 120A.

So, no need for these batterys in my eyes.

PS: Why tf would you want 160A **continuous** discharge, thats whoppin 7kW continuous power with 12S not even fully charged. dude what are you riding? even with a 4WD offroad built you will never, never, never, never, never, never, never, EVER exceed these limits continuously. NEVER.

when you draw 100A continuously for over 1 Minute, dude i will lick your balls i swear!

Buy VTC6, that will do the trick.

what does 30T stands for? Because 3000 mAh is pretty bad for 21700.

high discharge current = low capaticity

high capaticity = low discharge current

Might as well go for the 20650s that are up on IMR yeesh.

dude what are you riding?
[/quote]

4wd of hummie hubs. Before, I was pulling about 1500w continuous per motor with a 120 amp limit, for 6000w con. These motors are capable of more. Not getting close to that with li-ion at 80a though, due their large sag. My only competition in Cali was Derek, since not many people got into this early enough to want this kind of power yet. Give it a year more, and lot of people will want to upgrade to higher power as it becomes more normal feeling at lower power.

1500W continuous per motor? so you would say 4*1500W **CONTINUOUSLY**?

Never ever, maybe uphill or accelerating, but not on normal street riding.

I believe you if you got me some telemetry datas.. you got metr?

Why would I use my competitors app? I have my own app, which I released before metr.

This was my last build, which I deconstructed for my latest build, which now uses a 12s4p 30q. Not enough juice to even get close to 6000w now due to the sag of 18650's. I stay mostly above 48v on lipos while 18650s sag to 4.6 off the bat. That, mixed with lower continuous rating ,kills my potential for high watt draws.

I will get another lipo board setup in the near future though to show you I can do it. Not on flat grounds, no. But I live in San Francisco, where you could be going up 15% grade hills for a mile or more at times.

The other issue is define continuous. Theres no universal definition. My view is anything that lasts for more than 5 seconds is continuous. Certainly 30 seconds - 2 minutes is continuous. And I've done that before.

Have you even tried a 4wd board? With large powerful motors, and a large powerful battery pack with high vesc settings?

sorry, i am not aware of every programmers app in this forum.

continuous power is continuous, all the time, meaning when you drive you constantly use 6 kilowatts of power. there is no "time". i'd say everything beyond 10s is peak power - accelerating e.g.

please, i want to get these things clear, if you could provide me some informations about your power consumption i would be really happy. because no one really seems to know how much amps these boards draw, even not me. i am trying to gather as much infos as possible to find a good medium.

Everything depends on your setup. For me, I run 4x 4.12 vescs with a 12s4p li-ion with a 80 bettery amp limit.

The issue I have with your definition of continuous is that at times, you will pull 0 amps or very low amps and at times much higher. When looking at battery ratings, the manufacturer gives a burst rating. They don’t give any definition of what this means, so many people have different definitions. In my opinion, anything more than a few seconds is not burst and is continuous. On long steep hills, With my old board, I would pull 1500 watts per motor on the entire hill. That could be 30 seconds to 3 minutes. At that point, I would argue that is continuous. Because it’s not just for a few seconds. It’s a sustained current. On the new board I listed above, it only pulling a bit over 1000 watts per motor.
