Why aren't there many singular rear enclosures on builds. Instead of having the batteries up from in one compartment and the esc in the back in the rear compartment, could you do a slightly larger rear compartment? On larger build you certainly see one single massive compartment, but on midsize ones i often see the dual action going on. This would make it so I wouldn't have to bore into the deck to hide cables, etc. Does it have to do with clearance when riding? Any thoughts?

Makes it very back heavy, hard to carry.  It's also nice to have the clearance in the middle
