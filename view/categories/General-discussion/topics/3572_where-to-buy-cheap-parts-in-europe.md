Hi everyone!

I'm about to order all the parts that I need for my first build, I live in Italy and here there are no esk8 forum/shop/anything so I have to buy everything from all over the world.
The only thing that bothers me is that we have crazy import duties for stuff coming from outside europe, for example if I order 200â‚¬ of stuff on enertion I may have to pay 100â‚¬ of taxes :/
The vesc on esk8.de is too damn expensive, I can buy it on enertion and adding import duties it's still cheaper.
Pulleys and belts are cheap on enertion but only if I get free shipping (need to spend 300+ aud) but then I will have to pay a lot of money of taxes so I don't know what to do :/

If you send something person to person...like a gift....is it like that? Let's say I get the stuff...and mail it out to you as a gift...will you be hit with taxes?

If you mark the package as a gift there are no taxes because they add them based on the declared value of the item

Not cheap at all, enertion+taxes is still cheaper

Bought some small stuff on https://www.modellhobby.fr / https://www.modellhobby.de and for sure you can get stuff from the European www.hobbyking.com warehouse.

Bought some stuff from China, like my BMS http://www.batterysupports.com/ and was lucky didn't have to pay anything extra and it even arrived quite fast. Batteries from www.b-volt.com and/or https://www.akkuteile.de

Besides I bought the VESC and motor mount from esk8.de, yes I think the prices are too high, but what can you do (have more patience and buy from overseas) ;)

Anyway, all the best luck and lots of patience :)

That 3dhubs thing is really amazing! The only cheap material is normal plastic, is it ok for a pulley?

What about this? http://www.batterysupports.com/24v-294v-1418650-5200mah-7s2p-lithium-ion-liion-battery-pack-p-147.html

the advantage of buying stuff in europe is that you have two years guarantee on all stuff.
i would think this might be nice especially with the vesc which seems to have the tendency of dying with newcomers,  so if you buy the stuff from esk8.de the stuff will be easily replaced and it seems that it might be mutch faster to get the stuff from them, it seems they are able to build their stuff within three days in opposition two other supplyers where you can easily wait longer than 3 month and do not offer any guarantee on their electric parts

You can get away with paying a lot less in duty/taxes if you ask the different resellers outside of EU to mark the package with a lower value - lets say $35. Problem solved!
I would suggest that you buy your stuff from [DIY](http://). Their parts is great!

It doesnt matter if the value is lower when there is the so called administration cost.

Its not bad ofc if you only need to pay once. Imagine if you order from US and Australia. And you broke one two parts and require reorders, thats alot of $25 usd.
