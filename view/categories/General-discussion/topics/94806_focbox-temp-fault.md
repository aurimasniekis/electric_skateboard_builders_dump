Using ackmaniac bldc tool version 3.103 and motor wonâ€™t run due to a temp fault read by the focbox although the motor is cold. What should I do, do I need to downgrade the version? @barajabali, @CarlCollins

might be your temp sensor is broken.
try to set up your motor without sensors and look if the fault still there. if no and you want to use your sensors non the less, just disconnect the temp sensor wire form the jst plug which goes to the focbox.

It stays after I take the motor off, it was working fine a few days ago. Also vesc tool says the firmware is too old but itâ€™s 3.103

check real time data. what is the value of the temp? If itÂ´s a fault you canÂ´t reset, try to flash the same FW once again and hope it delete the fault.

just to get it right, it says 400 with and without sensor cable plugged?

Iâ€™m running it in bldc at the moment as I donâ€™t want to run sensored for the time being

looks like there is something signal on your input port than. Unfortunately I have no idea how to check that or eliminate that.
Make sure all plins are clean (both sides of the pcb), maybe upload a not ack FW just as last try.

no, go in the firmware section and look in the down left corner. there should be written which firmware is loaded. make sure itÂ´s the one for HW4.12 and not 4.80

410,411,412 is the file you need.

In the red field you will see the actual version installed on the vesc if you connected.

Than you have the wrong fw installed properly.

If you have one vesc with the right fw you could use the newest vesc tool and flash the right fw via CAN.

If no than you will probably need an st v2 link.

Amazon 8$. Just search for stl v2.

Didnâ€™t you said it was working before when you got it from an other user? Maybe he knows how the wrong fw came on it?

Yeah, he told me it was working and when I came to do motor detection, it somehow downloaded the firmware unless I accidentally flashed it without knowing better. Itâ€™s all @Boardnamics fault, I asked him to run motor detection and he probably flashed 46 since he has the trampa vescðŸ˜­

ðŸ˜‚ but trampa is hw6 ðŸ˜‚ so it would be wrong either way.

You donâ€™t have a second vesc laying around you could use to flash the right fw?
