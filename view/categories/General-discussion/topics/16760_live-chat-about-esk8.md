Hi guys,
I have created a Slack channel for live chat about esk8 and all things related.
If you're not familiar with Slack, it's a service where you create channels and chat with fellow members. 
It's browser based but it also has apps for Mac/PC/Android/iOS.

You can read more about what Slack is and what features it has here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slack_(software)#Features

To be able to join the Esk8-Slack you need to use this link to create an invite. Then simply follow the instructions in the mail you'll receive. It takes less than a minute.

Cheers

i think its a great idea, but imo id prefer to use discord, its free and the same as slack but doesn't require signup and seems more used around the globe

Good point. I have never used discord before, but I use slack daily in my field of work and I really like it.

discord is nice but somewhat heavy on resources, even if it does integrate nicely on mobile.
IRC is super super light weight and can run on everything, including a postage stamp practically. in fact i was surprised to see there wasn't an esk8 IRC

I would have prefered IRC, but it seemed a bit old school and all irc-clients aren't free.
It also takes a bit of learning and it's harder to share pictures, code snippets etc.

Lol, not to be a downer, but good luck. I tried starting a discord channel a while ago and it flopped hard:

I know man, I've been using IRC since mid 90's and I'm still using it. But it requires a bnc to be able to keep a backlog and you can't share pictures and videos straight into IRC among other things.

@evilboarder: I've enabled IRC-support for our Slack now :slight_smile:
If you register an account via the invitation link in the first post and then go to http://my.slack.com/account/gateways you will get connection info to be able to connect via any irc client.

Cheers

bump
i feel like some kind of live chat is important for the community but it's always tough starting from scratch
if this thread could get pinned it would be much better off

Ok, it seems like the public invitation link has expired and it's not possible to generate a new. There are ways to fix this with Slackin from GitHub but it will take me a while to set up.

@Mark @Vieo: Pm me your email adresses and I'll send you an invite right away

**EDIT:** Use https://esk8.herokuapp.com/ to get an invite. Simpy enter your email and an invite will be mailed to you instantly.

seems to be gaining momentum, but that's how these sort of community chat rooms always start, kind of small then slowly growing

@onloop Why did you un pin it if I may ask? If you don't feel it is necessary no problem, but I think it is a great way for people to get quick answers to basic ESK8 questions. Which would enhance our community and lessen the amount of question threads.

My 2 cents
