Hello eskate community. The last couple of years have been a fun ride, and while I love skateboarding (electric skateboarding in particular), I need to divert my energy into finding a full time Software Development job to support myself. I can not invest into new designs when I don't have money to even pay the rent.

When I started working with hummie, I was in my 2nd semester sophomore year of undergrad. I was hoping that by the start of my senior year, we would be pushing new and improved motors out the door. Due to many reasons, this didn't happen. 2 weeks ago, I finish my Bachelors in Computer Science, and I'm not in a place where the hummie motor project can support me financially in any way (it's actually the exact opposite).

With all of my colleges and classmates finding jobs starting at 120k+, I have to make a decision about where my time is best spent. I have decided that the best choice is to study AI and Machine Learning algorithms, build a few personal projects with autonomous driving algorithms, and aim for a job developing self driving car algorithms and technology. I have an interview lined up with UBer next week, and with most of the self driving car companies around here (either in SF or the Bay Area), and the great experience I've had in this community build personal electric vehicles, and some research, I believe I can be a strong candidate to work on a self driving project.

Thank you everyone who has supported me, taught me, and helped me get to where I am today. I would be where I am today without this forum and community,

Anyone who has a pending order, your order will be shipped tomorrow morning. I will be closing down my shop in the coming days. This industry is a lot tougher than it looks like to make any profit. Appreciate the hard work everyone puts into products. In my case, everything just lead to lost time, lost money, with the only gain being knowledge (which is hard to put a price on).

I will be back one day in the future to build again, but for the time being, I need to focus on my career. Hummie will continue on building great hub motors. I have faith in him to get them together and shipped, though I have no idea when.

Thank you everyone again and best of luck in your new builds!

Thanks for ur services so far. I'm also gettin into different path, film production by next month.
So I feel ya, esk8 is still developing and has lots of hurdle to overcome. I thought about doing business here in toronto but there are little to no margin for me so I did not go that path.

I wish u a good luck!

I actually figured out that Iâ€™m living on 35k a year right now. And my quality of life is not bad. The problem is people in SF in my field usually spend 4K+ per month on housing and have kids. I chose not to and I cook most of my food, so I can live pretty cheaply, even buying organic food. i even spend $100+ on a dinner at least once a week. Having kids in SF is what breaks bank accounts. That and having a stay at home spouse. I look forward to having some extra spending money though. I will be back in eskate one day. It is the ultimate combination of skateboarding with practical long range transportation.

Itâ€™s a tough hobby to be in. Things break a lot and itâ€™s all trial and error. Just because one part works on build (a) doesnâ€™t mean another copy of that same part wonâ€™t fail on build (b).

I recently had this happen also. Around 3k gone like that. Derek had the life in eskate. No kids, ton of money, he could buy any part he wanted. All vendors know the other Derekâ€™s in this community and thank you to all the people here who support the eskate industry. Itâ€™s a hard environment and a few people can really make the difference between success and failure.

The 9th p in the 12s4p must have shorted. I had an experimental mehod of assembling the battery that would allow for higher amp discharge then possible with tradition spot welding with nickel strips, I made 2 mistakes. While the copper string one the + side had the cell insulation and a layer of quality electrical tape between it, I didnâ€™t consider how vibrations could eat through this and the balance wires also had a place where they could have made contact with the 9th p if it cut through the silicon wire (it was good quality silicon wire). One of those two cases had to occurred and 1 cell lead to the next cell and to the next cell. A chain thermal runaway. Lucky, I had time to stop and jump off before the flames started. About 6 seconds of venting (I heard a loud hissing sound) and I jumped off and flames went crazy. Had to have the fire department put it out cause it burned for over 30 minutes.

Moral of the story, be careful with batteries. Iâ€™ve built many boards for over 3 years now with no battery fires, but if you are not careful with an in proven assembly method, you need to be super careful and expect this kind of thing to happen so itâ€™s not a surprise if it does

This industry is a lot of fun to be a part of. Seeing the reactions and excitement the community over new developments is a priceless feeling. It's also a tough time to compete if you don't have a foot in the market and a lot of investment money. This is why so few vendors actually create anything themselves, and when they do, usually 1 or 2 things at best. Most go to the china market, find cheap suppliers of parts and resell State side or in Europe at much higher prices, for doing nothing but receiving and pushing back out the door.

In SF lately, we've seen an explosion of electric scooter sharing companies, like Lime or Bird. I believe the same can happen in the eskate world also and will happen. It's a great time to be in eskate, but you also need to be in it with the right people. Because it's hard to innovate a new product on your own.

Dude I have to live in Sac just to survive and I make a lot more than that, granted I have a kid too, but we are dual income...I would love love to live in the city, hell, or anywhere in the bay area, like my home town in Pleasanton where I can only dream of one day buying a house. the place is stupid expensive and anyone living in San Fran has made grave sacrifice to live there...or they are made of money...I know the opportunity is greater, but damn dude, make some money yo, come back to us...

I wish you the best of luck while Esk8 is fun I'm sure you'll enjoy software development as well. You'll get up there and will possibly be back (hopefully)!

Getting to that took me many years, not straight out of college! I've had job offers in SF that pays more but standard of living there is so high it's basically a low paying job after paying rent/mortgage.

The truth is that I eat about $200 per week ($10400 a year) in groceries, and Iâ€™ll eat maybe $100 a week out in food ($5000 per year). I pay $800 per month for my own room in a rent for a pretty nice setup $9600 per year). And then car insurance and car is about $450 per month $5400 per year. Gas is another $1900 per year. And then another $8000 per year in eskate.  And maybe another $2000 in miscellaneous stuff.

Ok, maybe more like 42k, but you get my point. And I still live a pretty good life style. The problem is, kids are at least 80k per year. So yes, 1 kid and 120k is shity. Heck private school is 30k per year. I always wanted to have kids when I was younger, itâ€™s just not possible unless you make 200k+ in SF. And even then, my gfs ex husband struggles to afford his kid and he makes over 250k.

Yeah, as a first job out of college in software dev, you can expect on the high end a job around $80k, Even PhD scientists make this amount in their first job. Of course in other job markets it may be higher but the cost of living as well as income taxes are playing a role as well.

I'm assuming this was in the tourist district, haha. The mission is the best late night place in the city IMO. Great bars that are packed every day if the week till 2 am and a lot of really good restaurants open till 10 or 11 pm. $60 parking is crazy. I never have paid for parking in a lot or garage in SF, haha. You'll learn how to find street parking if you live here ;)

All depends what your doing. If I do web dev or app dev, then 80k is a pretty normal starting salary. But a lot of good jobs start above 100k. The UBer recruiter told me 110k is around where I would start if they hire me.

Again, it all comes down to if you want a family. You will struggle to support people on 120k in SF, especially a kid. But if your gf/wife works, and you have no kids, and you choose NOT to live in the 4k - 6k a month apartments, then you can live quite comfortably. You just need to know people and take your time looking for places.

So what makes this hobby or not a hobby for you?

I see it as not a hobby if it's your MAIN source of transportation. For me it's 100% a hobby since it's only for joy riding

Right, I agree.

But even ***if*** it's a hobby for you, it's still not in your best interest to call it that publicly.  And it can definitely hurt folks who use them for transportation and in turn hurt the environment as well.

"hobbies" are "optional" and "bannable" and "outlawable"

"transportation" is a "necessary risk"

Do you think driving cars in public would be legal if the public perceived it as a "hobby"?  Heck no.  No way.  Too dangerous.

So what should I call/categorize this as? I was into mountain biking in my early twenties since my college was next to a mountain. Moved close to the beach after and got into road biking. All hobbies and fun and never as a transportation because I cannot arrive at work sweating and need to change into a suit.

I guess riding is the transportation part and building is the hobby part of it.

This is an industry. A very fresh industry thatâ€™s only 3, at most, 4 years old. I used my board as my main mode of trasportation to get to my university every day. I plan to also use it to get to work when I get my first programming job. Cars are great, and itâ€™s not a hobby either,  as i need it at least 5 days a week to be efficient. But if you want to get to work in downtown SF, a car is the worst way to get to work if you live in the city limits (like me).

But donâ€™t get too caught up in it either. Thanks to bird and lime and al of the electric scooter companies, people here are starting to see how personal electrical vehicles are the future of cities like SF. Going out on he town with your girl? Yea, you drive and deal with parking being a bitch. But I need to ship something 4 long blocks down the street? Iâ€™m using my board. Need to visit freinds 15 long blocks away? Iâ€™m taking my board. If I can, I will use my board over my car any day. And people will see, that this is the future of cities, especially small cities like SF.

It hasn't rained in SF in like, 2 months or so now. It maybe rains 30 days out of the year, so rain is not a big issue. It does create chaos though because so many people here don't know how to drive in the rain, so they end up going 20 in a 35 for light rain.

...and people wonder why California has the been the center of skateboard evolution for decades, the lack of water led to riding empty pools too, and we all know how that turned out.

My point is that your perspective, is extremely unique, your perfectly temperate weather, smooth cement, heritage in skateboarding all lend to making such conclusions, BUT...like I said it's unique, if and when you left California and traveled the world, you would see what I mean...but I hear you..just be more specific when you say "this is the travel device of the future for urban environments" because those cats in Seattle would beg to differ, greatly..
