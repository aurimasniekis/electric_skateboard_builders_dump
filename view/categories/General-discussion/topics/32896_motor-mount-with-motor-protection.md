Hi, 
I am riding my longboard now for 4 months but i see that motor take some times some damage. So I want to prevent this. 
I saw that @laikiux had made a good mount, sorry laikiux for take you design. I hope you can accept it ;) 
What do you think guys? Can i do something better? Or is it better to skip the project?

seems like a good idea, plastic or aluminium?

I guess you could use some kind of a aluminum tube and bend it a bit, and for the heat drill some holes at the top (i do not even have a skate im learning to build one) that should solve the possible heat problem

Fined vent slots will sort over heating you dont mind that casing getting dented you could have 10 mm slots for air vents
