For me, a helical gear drive RKP setup is the dream. The AWD Jed board is an option but I would rather build the board myself. Are there any helical gear drive options out there for RKP trucks?

Also waiting impatiently for JedBoards to start selling their helical gear drive to us DIY folk.

Just saying if you get desperate it's probably not a good idea to order from Jedboards
