If you look at the picture above with the giant ass that space is big enough for 2 cars. But there is area to the right side (tail) and left top (ears) that can be used... im not against the idea of knocking out that wall on the left of the bathroom either.  Points awarded for creativity.

Also you dont have to use my drawing.

Can you fine tune your brief and also some things about yourself that you like. I already see a wall area where you can keep your boards on display. One your add some workbench and rool storage theres still heaps of room to do stuff in that space. Isnt there a window tomthe left wall of the cr sotrage side.

Yeah there is one tiny window but its so small its hardly relevent.  I'll probably replace it with extraction fans or something anyway... incase I wanted to do some welding.. hint hint ;)

@lowGuido
 
https://youtu.be/Pa5pU_bRLPA

So we were thinking you should knock out the wall to the left hand side as you enter garage. Looks like a column needs to be kept there, but demo walls to allow more light into that back workshop area.

Build up a small ramp within that section between wet area, so you can skate up and back within the 2 spaces and as a transition break between the 2 areas.

Build a L or U shaped workbench running along that left wall and to the back. Build lots of storage shelves and peg boards for tools. If you build a small return bench this could be used as a welding areea.

Boards could be displayed on a rack between that column and wall where the walls was demolished.

Block off or just dont use that door to the right and put a couch along the wall of toilet. Some graphics on the wall above the couch. ok shelves for some nice spirits. Theres a fridge.

Then an entertainment system to the back right hand side. So you have work and play. PS4 or Xbox would be good in there

Can you like and subcribe to my Sons YouTube channel everyone. He wants to get to 100 subscribers by the end of year. He would also like to win the cam, so develop his gaming channel. He does everything himself, and he did the minecraft model himself. The first floor is what he thought you could do upstairs.

Anyway some ideas for your space.

Hes a bit of a piro.  The thing is if he didnt put it out it would have all gone up in smoke.   Hell explode it next if he doesnt win. üòâ

If you hang a tv on very back wall you can use the space under it.  I see that other  side as loungie area.  Maybe more comfy seating there.

The fish is for a gold fish or aquarium 
The hat and umbrella is for a hat/coat/umbrella stand...next to the slot machine
The beer is a mini bar and fridge  
 Edit: add an area rug to dampen the echo when your filming on the casting couch and of course the camera!üìπ

True story

Looked at my face page and one of my friends is looking for an X-pole

So, a friend of hers says she has one, but she waiting for her son to move out so she can put it in there when he clears his stuff out

An X-pole is a stripper pole that has its own stage affixed to the ceiling
