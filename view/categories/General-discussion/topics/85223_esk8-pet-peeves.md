Aloha all! Genuine questions with none of the restlessness from past posts. Inquiring minds (mostly mine) want to know, what are your eskate specific pet peeves? Not just for riding, but the whole culture to include builds, safety, electricty, advertising, forum decorum, et al. 

Not a an open call to rants. Give us your burning top five. Here’s mine:

1. Automobiles use your blinkers.
2. Riders in cities, pretend to follow some traffic rules.  Increasing likelyhood I will clothesline bird scooters riding against traffic.
3. Advertisers, don’t claim your board is the fastest, most powerful, most best at anything. likely false, also desperate, this is why I DIY.
4. Don’t ride like a dickhead at group rides, we get it, you are skilled AF.
5. Builders, commercial and DIY, use metric only (this means you, America).

Shits me when boards are advertised with a rider without a helmet. This makes the board an instant turn off. 

Also the whole "quArtEr iNcH rIseR" bullshit like no it's 6.35mm...

Oh and another thing... Boards advertising in general with complete rubbish and impossible specs. 

i could go on for weeks

I have quickly gone from no helmet ever, to helmets mostly, to helmets ‘eryday. 

Although my day job is nag people to not do the fun shit in life, IDFK if someone else doesn’t wear one.

I know folks have passed on this forum. Wear one bc science, or don’t. I’m not your mom or doctor, we all gonna die.

"Here's a list of the cheapest parts I could find, can you tell me if this will work and get me 30 miles of range up any hill?"

"Here's what I want, can you guys give me a parts list to make it happen under $300?

I'm sure I have a top five but this is what comes to mind. As far as most stuff having to do with vendors and customers in disagreement, I tend to think of it as a job and then it's less of an annoyance.

- People who REALLY likes to carve in GROUP rides. It's so hard to ride with people who does this excessively. Almost got hit a few times.It's a group ride keep an open lane for other people.

- Vendors/builders who bash on other vendors is slightly annoying since I see this forum as a group effort to improve our [spoiler]hobby[/spoiler]. I've been guilty of this, but then again he swears his Koowheel with a paint job is the best thing since sliced bread.

- Esk8ers who bash on helmet wearing on FB, Reddit, etc. I get it, you don't want to wear a helmet, that's fine, but let's promote safety rather than risky behavior. Less deaths and injuries might help to keep the law on our side. This should be a "do as I say not as I do" kinda thing.

- WTF is kilo meter is that a gauge of kills in a game? :grin:

1 Helmets are big for me. Like it's your choice and all but when I see youtubers (who people are as role models) running around at full speed with no helmet. To me that's encouraging risky behavior. 
2 I want board manufacturers to advertise watt hours kv gearing ratio voltage battery chemistry stator size etc (in addition to the meaningless top speed and range estimates they provide for other customers who don't know or care what those other number are/ mean.
3 I wish the US would stop using metric like I've been raised using imperial and that's what's natural to me but why do we use it? It's so dumb is over complicated and makes no sense to keep using a measurement system no other country uses.

I feel you, but being stupid American educated. I got used to the system. My office is exactly 10 miles from work, I know where the 5 mile mark is on my ride. Now imagine calling that 8.05km and 16.09km....that also seems weird. So in some ways the frustration goes both ways. 

I'm fine with imperial when it's stuff like distance (miles) and height (feet & inch) but for tools it's so stupid. why the hell are we using damn fractions ?!?!?!

I like this thread.

My personal biggest pet peeve is traffic lights that don’t give a walk signal if you hit the button a second after the light has turned. Traffic is still going the right way for me to cross, but no, no crossing for you. This is why people jaywalk, because traffic engineers don’t give them a second thought.

On the other hand, I love traffic lights without crosswalk buttons that automatically give the walk signal. Two seconds late to hit the button? No problem, the walk signal is already on, ride right across.

With regards to helmets:
This issue is actually nuanced. I personally always ride with a helmet and flatland gloves. 

The biggest danger to Esk8 and bicycling is collisions with cars. Second by a good margin is single bike/sk8 accidents. This means that any behavior that causes cars to behave more cautiously near you is good. Wearing a helmet has been proven (with bicycles) to cause drivers to be less cautious near you, increasing the chance of a collision.

So helmets are likely to decrease your chances of head injury in a fall or collision, but likely increase your chances of collision with a car.

Prejudice is one of the worst things about everything in life. Maybe some young people are guilty of what you meant but so are plenty of older people. But being open minded and helping others open their minds is better than judging them due to age, sex, race, etc. 

Yes, I was dumb as bricks in my teen and early twenties. Getting older definitely changed my maturity, but I'm still a douchebag to some, such as people who makes comments like this...I'm almost 40. Still too young to not be a douche?

Traded the 2week old GT for a set of hub motors and electronics out of a ownboard to combine them with his ae hubs and make a 4wd hub board. He then gave the hub board away because he bought a carbon and my metro that week. 

Constantly brags about how much faster all his boards are compared to me on my single motor metro. He always seems to forget that he weighs 115 and I’m 240. 
Breaks his 3 week old carbon gt so he buys another entire working carbon to fix the one he broke? His grandpa just keeps buying whatever he asks for.

And his amazing jokes. Like when I walk up to him and he looks at my stump of an arm and says “hey Ben, I think you’re missing something...” 
I didn’t laugh. Or when I was standing on his carbon to feel the deck and he gives it full throttle with no warning. Super funny. 


Woah. Didn’t realize I needed to vent that much. 

Fuck you, David.

I’m used to just swinging when someone talks shit, but I’m normally very easy to get along with. Hadn’t been in a fight for 8 or 9 years. With in 3 months of losing my arm I had 2 people punch me in the face. One was a tweaker that had been physically and sexually abusing my ex of 5 years because she got addicted to meth and he kept giving it to her. Took 2 punches in the face before I put my bench a half inch into his tummy. 
Other dude was mad his girl left him and moved in with me. I just took that one, was fully worth it.



In all reality everyone probably thinks I’m an annoying twat and he’s dope. FUCK EM, IM STILL RIDING

Society's always going to be messed up, and that influences people of all age groups. I like to think that I'm turning out ok, and the influence of kind people on this forum helps that. As for my parents, they're perfectly respectable people. My dad is a software engineer/salesman and my mother is an English professor. That's why I'm going to advise you that when you go around categorizing entire groups as "duchebags", it may be beneficial to spell it the right way: *d-o-u-c-h-e-b-a-g*

tbh, it probably doesn't make much difference if you stick from the start to the end with one set of units. Units are units, and I guess they all accurately define what they want to measure accurately enough for our needs.

What sucks is to have different suppliers using different systems. Trying to marry it all in a build can some times be a b#tch!

Also @DerelictRobot 
AC is always more dangerous for the same RMS voltage compared to a DC voltage.
**Extra-low voltage** or low risk limits are:
<120 VDC
<50 VAC

Generally in the esk8 circles we don't operate near these voltages, but due to witnessing couple of electrical close calls at work (blown equipment due to forgetting to use isolating equipment) I'm just leaving this factual statement here.

Just in general, be cautious with powered equipment.

The world is changing. 38 now and the values passed on to me are no longer valued. Basic things such as respect and humility. Couple that with the shitty influence of social media, the importance of followers, the belief you are entitled to any job regardless of your own capabilities and you've created a generation of little monsters. The self entitlement is also seen here in the form of short and stupid questions. Typical behavior of others will do the research for me, I am of the generation who gets stuff handed to them on a silver platter (or click of a button).

Luckily, there are exceptions.
