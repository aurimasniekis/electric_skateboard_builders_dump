Has anyone gotten them yet? they seem interesting. The new dual 6.6 and dual 4.2 also seem smaller?

I don't know. Since today I guess? We have already thoroughly discussed it [here](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/davega-battery-monitor-odometer-speedometer/71509/1334?u=janpom). :slight_smile:

I think @janpom deserves a title like "Flipsky Innovator" or "Influencer" :laughing:

Well done!

I saw them on the website yesterday. One question is why is the 6.6 plus single only like $30 bucks cheaper?

If you look at the dual it says the same cause I thought that too but it saws the same.

I received my Flipsky Dual FSESC6.6 Plus. Its a little guy compared to these Maytech 6369 motors. Hopefully it is reliable for me while I wait for the Focbox Unity to arrive.
