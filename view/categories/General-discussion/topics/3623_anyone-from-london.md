Hi, 
Anyone else is from London and is building an electric skateboard? It would be good to share tools, experience and even shipping cost.

Started from O2 - went around park, bus lanes, cycle paths etc then headed to river around Greenwich/royal naval college, under river and around Canary Wharf.
Anywhere along river was good.

@Sikkolo should be around your area, I'm on the other side but I will definitely come west if we organize a ride ;)

I'm in Wimbledon!!

I bought a build to get started and get my snow legs back, but already started on parts for my own build. I ride the back roads where I live, and the park nearby.

When you're ready, let's do it!

Thanks oneafrkan for sharing. Glad to be part of this community. I bought an singledrive two months ago and my commute is so smooth right now. I also ride in Hyde or Regends (even it's no skating rule I had no trouble yet) when it's not too crowded.

Welcome, looking forward for the first meetup! I tried skating in Hyde too, I didn't know you couldn't skate there... I guess at least where bikes can go that's skatable... Also I noticed that on the main bike path that crosses the park they put lines of stones/rocks to let bikes slow down, I passed with my belt drive and that was almost unridable, I guess that those rocks will kill hub motors after the third line of rocks (I think they are ~10...), that path should really be avoided with esk8s....

Hi @makevoid and others. I'm based in South Africa, but coming to London to visit some friends and family and thought it would be cool to meet up with some of you guys from the north. I'm not bringing my board with unfortunately, but would be cool to see what you guys have done and where you ride. Let me know!

Radu didn't want to organize it too far in advance because of the variability of the weather

We went few laps around the park and then to stratford, it was fun :D

Hey Guys,

I am just starting out building my board here in London.

Would be keen to catch up with some people to find out how they have gone. Also can use all the advice I can get. 

Quite a few of my parts are in the post/should be arriving this week.
Last weekend I cut and sanded my deck..
