I had to just get this out there. I had a ton of edits and there were/are constantly things I want to change, but it wasn't doing anyone any good just sitting in the lounge.


@Deckoz, glad you are still hanging out! I may or may not have been checking your profile to see if you logged in....:grinning::grinning::grinning::joy::joy::joy:

Great write up!

Another thing I thought was helpful getting started would be to get an idea of how much a DIY board costs.  Expect to spend near 700+ For something decent.

The other thing is don’t get stuck looking at the cheap china stuff at first to save the money.  And diyeboard.com sells garbage...the stuff works for a little bit but will probably fail.  I’ve had about 60% go bad.

Here is my build list if it helps.

Good job @Sender, probably took a long time to do this. 

It seems we try to put these all encompassing, monolithic posts but they inevitably go stale after a while. Also the system prevents you from editing the original post after some amount of time. Anyway, better to have this than not. 

Could also wiki the post so it can be community managed.

Absolutely.  I plan on making it a Wiki. It was like that in the lounge.

I agree that the do get lost in the shuffle pretty often.

But it leads to someone knew doing something similar, but maybe from a different perspective. And as times change and this industry matures, maybe the advice should change with it.

@Sender Fantastic job man. These are the things everyone needs to read, especially the safety section. With more prebuilt boards coming out every day, people are getting worse and worse about it. Death is always possible, and often probable, in downhill and electric skateboarding.

@Sender thank you so much for writing this. This was much much needed. Personally I started getting into diy for wanting a powerful machine and thinking I could do it cheap. Ended up spending an arm and a leg. If I had read this article last year , I would have just paid @Psychotiller or you to do my complete build. Now I have all these tools and shit lying around that I don’t even need.

Good post.

I feel like there are enough vendor products out there now that anyone with descent amount of research can buy everything and fit them together like legos. If you do your research, you shouldn't need anything more than a drill and soldering iron to build a complete DIY to your liking. 

Now if you wanna start building custom enclosures, decks or drive trains, thats a whole different story.

I am assuming you would buy a battery from a vendor here :slight_smile: For a one-off battery, IMO better to buy it premade. if you see yourself building a few, the spot welder will pay for itself rather quickly.

Yes and no...

prebuilt batteries don't always fit in the enclosure on the deck you may want to build. and shipping can be interesting. Guess it all depends

It is the most dangerous part of the build as well.  Even with a good base of research and knowledge you can get yourself in trouble pretty quick.

To most folks I would recommend getting one made by one of the pros: @psychotiller, @thisguyhere, or @barajabali.


But it is funny how quickly the spotwelder pays for itself if you keep building.


If my spot welder only lasted me my first battery, it saved me money.  But not when you add up all the other little things I had to buy as well.


But a lot of people already have a lot of these tools and equipment and come from a other DIY background.  


It is all so case by case, but hopefully this gets people to really think about which is worth it for them, DIY, prebuilt, or custom.

@Sender

Can I make a suggestion to add a "opportunity cost" section to the wiki? It takes a shit ton of reading and time looking for parts which could have been spent working on whatever your actual dayjob/business is. 

If someone truly enjoys tinkering/electronics and finds it a bit of escapism, then go ahead and DIY it but if they are more of a rider and have more money then time, it makes zero sense to DIY it and far better to commission a board.

@sender thanks for this awesome post, I start my research in December, was going to buy a prebuild, then found that non of the vendors send to my country, then find this forum and start the DIY research, and 4 months later I have almost every part I need, most of them from BKB, a unity awaiting to be send(2nd batch)and after that arrive I'll buy a battery, and hope it's not the only board I'll DIY, but as you say, there are a lot of info, and search it's the way, but regulars are awesome help too, when you don't find what you're looking for. 
Thanks for your time and effort

I'm probably over optimistic but it seems to me that the glorious DIY era (where people rewind motors, pimp batteries or transmission, and fried a large part of it..) is ,almost, over and we are now closer to "plug and play" era  as standard components (motor, esc, connectors, battery, ) are now available... 

Transmission seems to be the last missing link, after that, it will be "open design" (diy or plug and play) vs "proprietary system"(rtr, brand) and it will be a whole new game...

Things are evolving quite a bit, but on these top end builds, they still are quite far from plug and play.

Depends on how deep you go into the rabbit hole.  Some go deeper than others.
