So I'm always fully geared when I ride I wear a motorcycle jacket, RuRoc helmet and knee/shin pads. Last night I got a throttle cut out during a full throttle test as I was leaning forward and I came off bad slamming the side of my helmet on the ground like a whip.

My gear protected me I have no road rash at all but even though I was wearing a helmet I have had a massive head ache since last night when I fell. 

At what point should I say okay I should see a doctor now?

Usually immediately. The brain isn't anything to wait on. Even if it's just to be cautious.

I actually stayed up didn't go to bed at all cause I was worried about a concussion. Maybe that's contributing  to my feeling off right now.

I fell just as hard in my TSG pass and it didn't hurt like this maybe the RuRoc doesn't provide as much protection as the TSG. Well time to order a new helmet lol

Eh, depends. It still costs nearly 5K here in the states for a quick head scan after a concussion, I know first hand. A helmet definitely helps though.

I'd rather have expensive health care then none I do have insurance but deductibles have gone too crazy levels since Obamacare went into effect.

Glad you are ok man.  Definitely didn't want to read another type of story.

Any reason on why you had a throttle cut out?

Ive had over a dozen concussions.
Sometimes its obvious sometimes it's just a weird lingering feeling. Just go in.
Ive had falls where I thought i cracked my skull and no concussion, and ive had falls i laughed off and later forgot what day of the week it was and where i lived.  ( I actually skateboard all the way to my old apartment where my ex lived. We had been apart 9 months)
If you have to ask. Just go.

Derek went to the hospital and released n then died days later and improperly diagnosed.   Maybe u need an MRI or cat scan of the head to know for sure.

Regardless of helmets when you impact the brain moves inside your skull man.  This is what is dangerous.  Best be safe than sorry.  On topic for me right now as the idiot(my eldest boy) has just come out after fracturing his skull falling off my evo.  The cracked noggin was the least worrying aspect as far as the hospital was concerned.  The brain swelling due to movement was the concerning factor and he has to be monitored every 3 days at outpatients to be sure of no recurring issues.  Get in there sunshine and be sure!!  Stay safe Dude.

Yes waiting is one of the worst things you can do with concussions, so is screens so you might want to limit your forum time for a couple days :frowning_face:

get it checked out, bud.  I cracked a Bell, felt ok but just had a little brown-out.. the next weekend I had a brown out doing pull-ups, fell again.

hard thing to admit for any person, but no matter how I try today, I do not feel steady when the wind starts buffeting my torso, even on the new Evo.  Danielle says I look rock steady.

All this brain injury talk scares me silly, making me want to go slow everywhere :turtle: :sleepy: :sleeping: :turtle: 

I have not had a concussion for like 15 years back when I was into freestyle BMX. 

Maybe larger helmets would help. More padding for the brain. :laughing:

I had a mild concussion after my fall but didnt have any headache or any symptoms till later at night.  I went to bed and the next day my wife told me I should go to the doctor.  Turned out I did have a concussion and fractured of a rib on my left side.  Didn't know about the ribs until I sneezed and felt a pop a week later so definitly kept track of what hurts when you first fell and what hurts several days later.

wow, lets see some pics of that helmet.. also even though it's a snowboard helmet it still offered enough protection to save you from a worse brain injury. thank that helmet, it may have saved your life.. the reason why most deaths happen when talking about head trauma is that whiplash you mentioned. 

scary stuff.. 

but it's probably time to invest in a better helmet with jaw protection that won't break off on impact, and more curved edges for smoother impacts. (tsg pass)

Yeah you will be for close to a week. However since you had full armor on it may be quicker I didnâ€™t have any armor besides a brain bucket helmet. The road rash was probably the worst minus the ribs cause my shirts kept getting stuck in the scabs

I don't think its because of the helmet size or something. Itz just the way your head hits the road and you will be immediately dead even by the force against your head or you just fucking break your neck. There is no guarantee you will survive a crash just because of a helmet, it just minimizes injures but doesn't really save you when everything gets out of control.

Hey guys I've been feeling better I'm just always sleepy but I'm  doing well. So looking at my board I think I found the cuplrit 

![20181019_161305|666x500](upload://x7lpDvW9sCkqZW5F9qqV6YOOjlY.jpeg) 

Looks like the receiver plug is too long and has the wires rubbing on the deck. 

![20181019_161314|666x500](upload://gJB7FORidr2Dc17ABKXeNaNFJQk.jpeg) 

I think I will solder the receiver wires directly to the pins so that way there is no clearance issues.

If I was you I would check that's xt90 connector and the rest of the build..
Bare cables showing off ,:slight_smile: it's not a confidence builder :frowning:

Sorry if I sounded rude, but we all know that when we are near finishing the build we get a bit sloppy from the eagerness to try the board :)

That plug is nothing to worry about the insulation just moved back a bit when I moved the wire. When it's in place the insulation doesn't move but I'll put a drop of hot glue on it just in case.
