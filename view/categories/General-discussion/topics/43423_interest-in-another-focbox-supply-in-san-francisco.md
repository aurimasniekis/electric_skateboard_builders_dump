I am considering purchasing FOCBOXs in mass quantities from Enertion to sell in the San Francisco area since @evoheyax seems to have been out of stock for a while now. However, profits are low, and it is quite an investment which means I need at least 10 people that think they would purchase at least one. How many would be interested? This would make shipping in California extremely cheap for FOCBOXs, potentially saving a few $$$.

You can’t just buy in bulk from Enertion anymore, you need to be a part of the official supplier program

I'm aware - that's exactly what I would be doing. As I stated though, I calculated the profits and found that despite enertion's claim that profits are around 350$/month, max profits would be around 230$/month with 10 FOCBOXs. When I asked how they got to that number, I was replied with "Well, you sell it for a bit more and there are always shipping charges ;)". I don't intend to inflate shipping price...

Sorry, I wrongly understood 😅

@anorak234 I'm in the air about what to do with the focbox program. Profits are so low ($15 per focbox if you sell at $155) in them that it's more so eating up capital that could be used on more profitable things I'm working on, like hummies hubs and my hollow core decks.

On top of that, everyone interested refused to pay that price. I couldn't sell a single focbox at $155, because no one was willing to pay that. I didn't offer anything special other than the fact I'm here in the US and you would get quick shipping, but the convince was still not enough.

At the end of the day, I'm more focused right now on the hubs and decks, and will likely need to develop my own vesc version at some point to compete. If it's not original, good luck selling it in a way that will be worth your time.

At the end of the day, all that enertion does is have a factory make them and ship them to me. That's maybe 20% of the work, while they take 90% of the profits... It's not really a fair system.

The program makes absolutley no sense condidering the design hasnt changed and months before they sold them for $99. Its not fair to the customers either for a $35 charge increase per vesc. It just doesnt make sense at all for anyone except enertion who takes in all the profit making it completely unreasonable to sell their vesc considering few people want to buy at $150 each

I always had sell Vesc over 135USD... what wasn’t making sens where people buying them at low price and sell them back at a price way lower than Enertion.., basicly it is just killing a product, Enertion should have never sold them at that price range, but I think Jason did it so people could do group buy and get fairly great price, but it turn out that some people bought them to resell them instead, which in not bad, but they wheren’t alwayls doing it at a logic price, considering the product in relation of the market.

So... It is still more advance and reliable than other vesc available on the market.

I paid around $180 ea. for my Ollin Vescs which I guess are no longer available.
I feel the quality of the Focbox and the way it's packaged makes it a bargain for $155

This is the problem when you don't regulate your resellers prices. But jacking the price to almost $140 each for us to pay, to resell at $155, doesn't make much sense either.

The better option would have been to leave it at $100 per focbox for resellers, and refuse to sell to us again if we don't sell at a minimum price, say $150. Instead, now we can get blacklisted for selling too cheaply, on top of the fact that we pay crazy high prices for them.

For example, for hummies hubs, we did a bulk order from ABEC for front wheels. We have a contract that says we can't sell for something like less than 10% (+/- 5% for my bad memory) than ABECs price, so we can't undercut the market. This doesn't mean they still make 90% of the profit, and only give us a 10% profit margin if we were to resell them. It's more like 40% profit.

Mean while, I calculated how much I believe enertion makes every month selling the focbox alone baised on the information I have, and I came up to over 20k a month in profit alone. That's pretty nice profit for something like this. Mean while, us little guys can at best, make 1k a month if we manage to sell 1 focbox per day at full price, which in the month I tried, was basically impossible. At our current plans, it's more like $300 per month, if you can sell one every 3 days, which is still hard.

Now that enertion did the big cyber monday/black Friday deal, which is far better than the resellers deal, it will be even harder for us to resell at full retail price, since everyone who was waiting (including customers of mine who were going to buy focboxes from me) jumped on this deal. Why can enertion sell it at full price still? Because they put in more time in advertising and their name is on the product. Idk about you, but I fell better buying a product like this directly from the manufacturer rather than a reseller.  I've figured I would need to spend 20+ hours a week building content to be able to sell 1 focbox a day. At 1k per month in profit, that's $12.50 an hour. Minimum wage here in SF is $13.50. With my own product, I can make 100 times that, like enertion is. If I made even $30 per focbox, doubling my profit, this would be worth while for me. But at this time, it's simply not.

This is a very fair point. Focbox's are also open source so really anyone can make their own to compete. 

I was considering becoming a reseller in the USA, but it is 100 percent pointless once their is another US person who will sell and ship it at the same price as me. The profit margin is way to slim for me to deal with the 1 hour it would take me to mail it. 15 dollars an hour is not a lot of money. And it is not even consistent money.  At least as a jeweler I could get 12 an hour for 40 hours a week. Might be a little bit of hardwork but it was consistent.

And that the point if you’re not interested in putting down the money for coverring production cost (wich is around 20-30K) going the reselling route with a profits of around 10% per units sold, is not that bad.

And as @Namasaki had mentioned 150USD  for a good speed controller, is a fair price

Really don't want to fight or argue with you, I know we see things differently, so not trying to poke the bear or anything. But hummie has deals with paris and abec, and both give them to him with a 40% or more profit margin left.

I think 20-30k is a bit extreme for production costs. Maybe if you want to start out with 500 units, yes. But 5-10k investment on the start up should be enough to get a product like this going. Hummie built his hub motors on far less than 30k investment, it was more like 10k.

Have you tried reselling focbox's, with out the title of "DRV Wizard"? lol. They don't sell them selves. Even now, I calculated that just with shipping time and time advertising, even if I had sold the 10 I sold at full price, it would have made only $8 per hour. I settled for $4 to get them out the door.

Unless you invest a serious amount of time into reselling them (so you can sell 100+ per month), you won't make enough to make it worth it. Small time 10 - 30 per month focbox resellers like me are not going to see enough profit to make all of the work creating content and advertising worth it. I can go get a job doing software development and make $80 per hour, so why waste my time with peanuts?

Any one who buys into this program with the hopes of making their own products, are losing capital that could be spent on something where you can actually make a fair salary. I would be content If I could get my company to place where I could make $40 per hour.

I'm assuming enertion makes about 20k per month on the focbox, probably 10k on the nano-x and 20k on the raptor 2's. That's 50k per month in profit. Take out 20% to taxes, and your at 40k. He has a few employees. Lets say he pays them 4k per month, x 6 employees I believe. That leaves 16k per month for himself. Now yes, this math is all on what ifs. But I know my focbox estimate is not too far off. This would mean Jasons salary is $100 per hour.

Surely he could pass some of that onto his resellers. Making any product enertion sells is not that hard, just takes time, money, and connecting with the right people. The hardest work is on the selling aspect. If I could get people to do all of my selling and only give them 10% profit, I think EVERY company in the world would do that and no one would sell their own products.

Couldn't agree more, profit is one thing unreasonable pricing is another. $150 for a good componenet is fine by me however considering they sold them for 99 bucks a few months ago sort of eats at me and makes me want to find a new vesc

It's also fine by me. But when you consider the v4.12 being sold around $100, more people in this community turn to those than the focbox. Then look at universities, and legit researchers/hobbyists who use them for more than electric skateboards. I know if I were them, I'd be buying from the manufacturer themselves and not a third party. For resellers, it's tough if your not already known for your VESC knowledge.

I think taking the vesc 6.4 to production will be the cheapest solution, maybe allowing us to break the sub $100 barrier. I will be do some research, since I'm just waiting for my sample hollow core decks and motor parts at this point.

Reselling can not pay for all your months bills but it can help to get some extra money, to sell them here is not so hard, those resellers who bought it for 100$ will soon be out of stock and people will buy from normal resellers, shipping time is also not so time consuming or hard, on your way home stop by at the posts put them in a bag and ship 3 minutes per focbox 

If someone with some money comes in the vesc game enertion can be easily taken out for the vesc market assuming he makes a 30 or 50% profit and not 100% like enertion of course with proven reliability

I don't intend for it pay that much. But you have to do analysis on how much I'm actually making for my time. When you look at the discount we get as whole salers vs other company in the skateboard industry, they don't line up.

[quote="Acido, post:25, topic:43423"]
to sell them here is not so hard
[/quote]

The process if getting to a place where you can sell them is not. But selling is a different game.
First, there were the $140 vescs that everyone loved. People were used to that price. So when I tried to sell at $155, people were more interesting in waiting to see if they could get it cheaper again sometime in the coming months. Their prays were just answered with this $100 focbox. I commend Jason for doing this as it will greatly help the community, while sacrifice a lot of profits for himself. At the same time, we are paying $135 per focbox through our monthly plan.

It's hard to sell when everyone anticipates the price will dip again at some point.

Don't get me wrong, I had a lot of interest. But everyone wanted lower prices. And when I couldn't do it, they didn't buy.

haha, good stuff. You get more out though. I'm focused more on innovating from the ground up my own products though then getting my name out there through social media and the likes (not to say you don't innovate. I'm mostly interested in getting a vesc 6.4 version going. Trampa has a 200% markup on them right now. They only cost $30 more than the focbox to make. $150 vesc 6 is totally doable, espeically if you take out extra parts that don't effect performance.

True. Until i have the money, i can't bribe broke college kid engineers to debug and rework switches and motor controllers and BMSs. I already spent a bunch of my weed money bribing a fine Canadian to make my pulleys. For now i have to settle with using proven tech, my own flavors, friends in France who share my love of new part designs, friends in Canada who like to fix things, my other friends in Canada who like to break things, my other friends in Canada who like to design things, and my son who is both filled with ideas and some fresh new destructive force that results in good failure information on a regular basis.

but really, its my hair that gives me all my powers. Also, i'm still trying to build electric skateboards. I figure you and a lot of other guys are building some new kinds of vehicles. gear drives, all wheel drives, complex suspension, linkages, super wide stances... none of that is me. I'm deliberately retaining skateboard status and i have no intention of branching even an inch away from that. Even some of these precision trucks are too complex for my taste. 

That thing your doing, that's out of my scope. That's a whole other animal and you're good at it, so i'm going to stay over here and just watch with interest.

Not trying to bitch, just giving my 2 cents on my experience with the focbox program and with other reseller programs.

I just want a fair chance. I can't even discount the focbox to package with other items because theres basically no profit margin on my end already. And then the discounts way below our reseller price have lead people to expect cheap focbox's. If you really want one, just wait. So many people ordered them, they will pop up for $140 new from some one on here once they are shipped.

Give us the $100 focbox price and I'll sign a contract that I won't sell it alone for less than $155 so the price isn't soiled. Just a fair chance is all I ask...

The program doesn’t offer resellers the opportunity to make much money, as for exposure I would have no problem paying the upkeep of this forum. My issue isn’t with the vesc or it’s quality but rather that the program doesn’t offer the reseller much profit and that the product was originally priced at 99 bucks and was increased by a whole $50.

Obviously I bought 4 $100 FocBoxes because that’s essentially a $200 saving. I’m not complaining about getting a good deal, but Jason’s pricing made authorized seller lose business for a long time as no one will buy a FocBox at anything over $110 right now. I feel a partial refund needs to be made to these resellers to reflect that pricing as they paid a lot more that $100. 

Saying that they are not willing to work for success is an insult on this matter as no amount of “work” will make me choose to pay $150 when a $100 option is available. Unless it ships with a $50 bill that is.

In the glass blowing industry retailers get stuff at half price. In the jewelry business their is a 300-500 percent mark up for retailers. When my friend sells bead jewelry to me to resell I get a 200 percent mark up to retail it.  

When glass blowers sell to retailers they do not set up a stand out front and sell the same stuff at the same price. (Buying from your website is the same as buying from your retailers website, only difference is shipping time)

Retailers, especially ones like me who aspire to have an Esk8 shop in the future, can not afford to pay rent if they only get a 10 percent mark up. Especially when the supplier sells the same thing for the same price. 

I love your products Jason, that is why I order product from you. You are like the Porsche of the esk8 scene and I can afford the high prices. Most people can not. 

I want to see more people transitioning and using esk8 as a mode of transportation and even though your stuff is quality the only way to get people to ESK8 is a low barrier to entry. 

I admit that I am new to the scene and still learning, but what I do know is that Meepo's have gotten more people riding Esk8's in 4 months than Enertion ever has.

well this is neither the glass blowing nor the jewellery business so it is not a good comparison. Groceries are typically sold at 5-10% markup. I do understand your point however.

I think the main issue is the cyber Monday sale and that Jason likes selling stuff to the customer directly, cutting out the middle man. This way he also keeps the selling prices of his products low, gaining market share.
(he did however advise resellers to stock up on foxboxes on cyber Monday)

Sooner rather than later someone else will have to step up and also start mass-producing quality vescs at an affordable price. I just wish BV would do that...

what I do know is that Meepo’s have gotten more people riding Esk8’s in 4 months than Enertion ever has

Yeah not much interest as anyone who wereinterested have gotten a few during the Black Friday sale. Would be great to stock up and resell for like $130 but it’ll take a while to sell your stock.

Happy to do a deal with Resellers right now. $99. Moq. Cash upfront. PM me.

Otherwise when I'm funding your stock purchase and promoting your business for you, you will need to take less margin. 

The profit margin is still very good with this consignent offer, the problem is you guys are discounting it.

The FocBox is the hottest product on the market right now, you don't need to discount it. We sell over 200-300 every month at full price. Resellers should be leveraging the opportunity to add-on some of their other products and make some unique bundle deals with their FocBox stock...

Im also happy to help you all grow your business, I have over 15 years of experience in sales and running retail businesses. Free marketing and sales support.

The truth is, Nobody gave me anything, I worked hard for it, and I got where I am today without relying on help from others, if you are hungry for it you can make it big too. So I apologize I don't tend to listen much to people saying selling is hard and it can't work. Make it work.

Also. Happy to discontinue the program.

If that's directed to me, I can say 100% I'm not offended, I've seen this type of reaction a 1000 times. Some people get "it", some don't.

If folks don't want to work really hard to grow their business they just won't be successful & This doesn't bother me.... Not everyone is going to be successful in this game, but I sure want to know and work with those who are...

My primary objective (apart from building my own killer eboards) here is to educate and grow the industry and get everyone building really high end esk8's using FOCBOX (or any vesc based system) - I don't want shit china esc's to dominate - & I can't bring the industry forward on my own. I just want others to stand up and drive the esk8 builders movement with me, the more players in the high performance realm the better.. 

The best way to get everyone building high end esk8's with quality motor controller tech is;
1. Make sure stock is readily available globally.
2. Make sure that customers have support and service from industry experts in their local area.
3. Make sure that new start-ups and existing businesses can get a product that they might not be able to afford normally. I know first hand how hard it is to manage cash flow.
4. Make sure plenty of people are building Amazing high-end and reliable DIY esk8s


I'm sure when I have hundreds of resellers on the program I can start doing much better price's, but we must start somewhere. The economy's of scale will work their magic eventually, but like anything good in life it's going to take hard work and a bit of crazy.

If you keen for a ride step on board the crazy train... Otherwise get off and make room... We shooting for the Starz.

Thank you Jason for all the hard work you do for the Esk8 community. This forum is a gem and I am so grateful that you started this. I believe in what you are doing and I see the value in your products. That is why I give my money to Enertion and buy your products. 

I look at Enertion as the Porsche of Esk8 and I love it. Some people just want a Honda(meepo). I actually like the China ESC. I feel like it is easy to use, affordable, and programmed well. It is perfect for the NON-SKATEBOARD community. It is perfect for the beginner who does not skateboard or Esk8 but wishes to learn.

Thanks for the kind words.

The Chinese ESC actualy seem to work ok, and they will only get better...

But you cannot easily configure them to run various motors. You cannot do anything with the.. Most often they are hard coded to work with one motor.

Zero configuration, it's the opposite of what building esk8 is about.

Now I think about it, _Long Haired Boy_ sounds like an enticing hair conditioner brand.

@longhairedboy permission to use your likeness? I'm gonna start bottling some hair conditioner and sell them for like $40. I'll supply retailers like you at wholesale for $35. You don't get much profit, but you can always charge more for shipping and handling fees 😉

Read this entire thing and I see the same thing that I read with trampa about his prices shifting. Seems like just a systematic problem none of them can stay consistent because the market always shifts. So we r all stuck with these products untill we either step up and make our own style of FocBoxes or trampa style boards untill then we get shafted by those who do have these products.  My uncle told me once "either step up from others or stand behind them in line"  of course he was looking for his beer when he said it but it still applies. Just my opinion

Another thing is why cant the resellers in each country get together and do a type of group buy at that MOQ for that price then just send it to one person and divide and ship from that person it might save everyone some money who cant afford to do that moq on there own

i think with a reasonable $3.50 per sale licensing fee we can get this moving. It needs to be whatever is in TRESemme for Dry & Damaged because that shit is the absolute bomb.
