```
Was riding back from the gym yesterday around 6:30pm, with my headlights and underglow lights on.
Our new bike lanes are pretty ill-designed, since we have two lanes of opposing traffic, then two lanes of opposing bike lanes, then the sidewalk.
A car stopped at a stop sign trying to turn right into the road didn't see me coming from his right, and just as I was about to pass in front of him he accelerated to make the turn.
I saw him from the corner of my eye and jumped up.
I was wearing my slide gloves so thankfully I just slid on my left hand and butt across the hood and landed on both my feet, able to run it off.
I like to think I looked like Channing Tatum from 21 Jump Street sliding across the hood of a car, but I probably looked more like Jonah Hill. 
![PNG|690x353](upload://gn714KE6fh2Cc85vOLt8GYQqjIJ.jpeg) 

My board wasn't so lucky however, and got jammed right in the center under his front left tire.
I told the driver to try to reverse the car, but my board kept getting stuck under his bumper, so he got out of the car and we both lifted up the front end of the car a bit so that his passenger could pull out the board.
I should have gotten a photo of the accident, but I wasn't really thinking straight and wanted to move the board so we weren't blocking traffic.

I assured him I wasn't injured as far as I could tell, and we met up in a parking lot up the road so we weren't blocking traffic.
He was very nice and kept saying he was sorry. Since there was no real damage to his car (except for a small dent in his hood which he didn't mind since the car was old), we decided to not call the police to file an insurance claim and just settle between ourselves.
My deck snapped in the middle, led lights got torn off in the middle, and one of the rear tires got pushed off it's hub.

![IMG_20190208_192855|375x500](upload://rD1LLWGe5DXhxvVIDm0MDjNQJNs.jpeg) 

We've exchanged contact information, and he's offered to pay for all the damage to my board.
As far as I can tell, everything else on the board is fine.
I am wondering though if I need to get a new rear truck, since it did take a hit to it. 
The axles or motor mounts don't seem bent or anything.

Anyways, I'm glad I came out of that incident ok, and I'll be more careful from now on.
I almost always make sure there is eye contact between me and the driver of a car before I ride in front of them, but I was in a rush to get home since I had to get home and get my protein intake before I lost all of my gains (just kidding) and it was freezing outside.

Stay safe out there guys, and always ride like you're invisible.

Side note: I'm opened to deck suggestions to swap everything over to.
The driver is paying for it, but he's a grad student so I want to keep it cheap.
I paid $90 for the Ownboard deck that broke right now, so if I end up getting something cheaper I can save him the difference.

Theres definitely a few on there. 
Didn't see full picture of your deck so im unsure what you're trying to replace.
Im not really into decks with much flex so i can't recommend much.

Here's my build thread if you want to take a look.
I like the flex of bamboo/fiberglass decks, but unfortunately my school's workshop doesn't really like us drilling and otherwise working with fiberglass since everyone has to wear masks.
If that wasn't the case I would go for something like this.

Well, I was also hoping to route out a groove for the wires between the enclosures, and I also need to cut out a small pocket in the deck to make room for my battery's bms based on the size of my enclosure.

I have his license plate, and he goes to the same school as me, so don't think he'll try to scam me or anything. I wasn't sure what the extent of the damage to the board was, so I told him I'll let him know what the costs will be later.

Yeah had that happen.  Full acceleration while leaning forward like a ski jumper to full brakes.  Fly baby fly.

Go to the docs.  Get checked out.  If it hurts now tomorrow you won't be able to move.  Glad you're ok

Yah man a fair few people don't seem to look for cyclists or care about bike lanes when they drive. It's probably gonna happen if you ride on busy streets or with cars a lot for a long period of time.

I probably would have called the police about it just because no money exchanged hands so there is nothing saying he is at fault nor something that would help you build a case against him if he doesn’t pay. Just because you are an honest person doesn’t mean they are.

He did send me a text later saying "Sorry I ran over your board" so I think that counts as admission of guilt. I appreciate the concern, but I didn't want to complicate things, and he seemed like a honest guy, he didn't hesitate to give me any info or where I can find him on campus.

I hope that is true because I have seen it so many times where you think the person is being honest and truthful but they end up being the opposite. 

My wife was injured at our college during a college sponsored event at nightbecause the college neglected to put salt down on icy steps even after a delivery person fell earlier in the day. Broke her leg and then wouldn’t move her to a first floor room so she didn’t have to go up three flights of steps because the person in charge of the housing was a racist. My wife chose not to sue the college or anything because that wasn’t to type of person she is. Needless to say she still deals with leg pain and paying off the student loans from her 1.5 years at that college 12 years later.

Good luck with this I’m glad you are ok because a board can be rebuilt.

Wow that's a crazy coincidence, I follow all the projects you do and always thought you were cool. Yeah they redid State Street two years ago, and the new bike lanes are super dangerous. I've seen a Boosted mini rider run into the side of a van after it blindly turned into the bike lane, and I know three other guys that's gotten into accidents on their boards in that same spot.

Yeah, it really blew up in 2016 I would say. I see a ton of Meepo, Backfires, and Boosted Boards. Not many (maybe two or three) DIY builds, which is lower than I hoped for an engineering school with as much available resources as we have. 
Funny thing is, I mentioned my accident in the Boosted board Snapchat group, one kid said "time to get an actual Boosted board." If only I could open his eyes to the DIY world, he'd see that anything not a Boosted doesn't mean it's a cheap knockoff. I'd offer to let him try my board if it wasn't out of commission.

Yeah one of my good friends here is a marketing major who jumped into the world of DIY esk8 this past summer with zero experience. I've helped him a lot with problems that have come up since then, but it seems most college kids would rather buy something prebuilt. 

Boosted board owners can be like the Airpod owners of the audio world haha.

That would have been funny if your friend was my TA, since I always have my board, it's my means of getting to and from class everyday.

Yeah, thats weird. If the driver comes with his car out to the street, his normal instinct is to turn his head to the left, watching for the upcoming traffic (including any biker comming up), if nothing comes he then turns to his right to go up the street! He doesn't spect the weird situation of a pedestrian, biker, car, nun or squirrel also coming down on this unnatural way to direct traffic. C'monn! this is the city's traffic fault allowing such a weird double biker lane on the same side. It drives drivers nuts. Why they don't draw one single biker lane going down on the other side of the road and another single biker lane coming up on this side of the road. Like in the rest of the planet, like in a normal country. They tried to be creative and instead they came up with a mess. No wonder our fellow driver almost ate his teeth with this one. Nuts!

Yeah it's a clear problem, you summed it up pretty well. Perhaps it'll take time for people to adjust, but until then, there's going to be a lot of accidents. Like I said above, I personally know of 4 other esk8ers who got hit/ ran into a car doing just that, either turning right without looking right or turning left without looking behind them. They've recently put these neon green crosswalks next to the normal white crosswalks to signify a bike lane, but I guess it's still a problem.

Yeah, it will continue to be a problem. There are millions of 75 to 90 year olds that still drive the streets of Northamerica; they don't have the reflexes or presence of mind to be aware of this puzzle that cities are bringing to them. Poor guys are overwhelmed  by these weird traffic conditions which even fools younger people. Just think: you in the same situation will not turn your head to the right but instead to your natural left, where the driver's seat is also positioned! Your natural place inside a car in major western countries (except a handful british ones) is the left front seat, the driver's seat. This is the natural way in which such drivers behave daily with traffic challenges almost everywhere in the world. These cities are upping the complexity bar for drivers with this one. :face_with_head_bandage:

Speaking of old people, you just reminded me!
This is video from a couple days ago I took when I saw an older couple driving in the bike lane.
Now that I look at it, it's the exact spot I got hit :rofl:

Here's another example, filmed by someone else on campus.

A lot of people really underestimate how unaware and distracted drivers can be sometimes.

Just reading through all of this. I think it really depends on what you are used to, this type of situation is very common in the Netherlands and wouldn't be the slightest of problems as people are used to looking both ways. 

But if something is done a certain way all the time and then they change it problems arise. People take time to adjust, I'm guessing in 5 years it ain't a problem anymore. But yea, for now it sucks

I'll be purchasing the rear trucks from @dickyho again, and the mounts are suprisingly still good. Took them off today and they're straight as an arrow.

Do you think the core of the wheel that was on the truck that bent is still good as well?
I didn't notice what wheels you were using. 
I've got some abec clones that saw some abuse and now have the slightest wobble on one wheel.

The wheels are airless 6 inch wheels, also from dicky. 
I inspected the wheels and couldn't see any cracks or damage once I pushed the rubber back into place on its hub.

Don't get that one. The bamboo one has cracked on me. The thick maple one has been solid though.

Really? I've heard nothing but good things about them, so I already ordered. I am aware however that dropthrough decks will be more prone to snapping thus I've designed a backing frame like [this](http://www.riptidesports.com/backing-frames-104/) one to further support the area where the trucks are. I'll be cutting it using the waterjet out of 1/4 inch aluminum.
