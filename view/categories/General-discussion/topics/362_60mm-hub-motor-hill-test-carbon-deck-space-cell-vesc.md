I like it and they seem to be more powerful then the 50mm's.

Hub motors can be strong driving up hills.

Acceleration test on almost the same setup, some other 60mm hub motors (83mm wheels) with the Enertion cell and VESCs:

Hello every one, I wanted more hub motors for personal use so I have placed an order for 20x of my 63mm hub motors.
They are based on the 6355 motor that enertion sell and will have the same high quality stator and winding with my magnet upgrades.

The motors will also come with a 83mm wheel on the motor. 

The great thing is I will be selling them for $299 for a pair. They have great power and save you a lot on your build while looking so much better.<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/5/5ee2d8a0a4fb606287d0e4fe4c221c85607266dd.jpeg" width="666" height="500">

Please every one let me know your interest, there are only 8 sets up for grabs as I need to keep 2 for myself. If I need to order more I can do that.
