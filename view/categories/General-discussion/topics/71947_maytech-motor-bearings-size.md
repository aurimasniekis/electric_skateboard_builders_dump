Do any of you guys know the size the 6355 sealed maytech motors use?
I would hate to have to tear down the motor and then reassemble it just to find out the bearing size, so if anyone of you kind gentlemen know what bearings I should buy, I would really appreciate it.:grinning:

It is 698zz.
I sent an email to Maytech and got the answer 9 minutes later :open_mouth:

What's the ID (inner diam.), OD (outer diam.) and thickness? You can get the bearing model with those numbers.
