I mean unless the focboxes are fake, and it doesn't use genuine cells, only the physical parts can fail. They pitch commuting more than anything so if they've current limited the motors appropriately I reckon it would last a tad longer. But not a thousand dollars worth

This is not the first company from taiwan offering seemingly good products at a reasonable price.  I was recently in contact with a company called haggy and the guy said his stuff was manufactured locally.  Maybe we are just witnessing the exploration of a new market by another manufacturing hub. He did hint at a direct drive too.

I managed to get a hold of the owner.
Shops are only in Taiwan, that SF address was there because SF is likely where he would open up shop if theres enough interest. THERES no shop there

He is DIY turned vendor.

Here are specs:
Motor: 60kv, max amp 60 amps no sensor
ESC is chinese but is modified for the board with larger capacitors

The enclosure will comfortably hold 2 focboxes.

There are 2 options for the battery packs both running 13s1p
Samsung 25R (for ALMOST air travel safe)
Sanyo NCR 20700B 

Trucks are rated very conservatively for 200 KG.

Board is set up to run foc unsensored with 20 amps per motor.

Now here are the interesting part:
He has control over the production line (he isn't buying off the shelf parts)
He is willing to consider selling parts (I am probably picking up motors and enclosure with the BMS in it and adding batteries myself)
He is willing to consider putting out custom motors (60 kv 80 amps sensored drives anyone)
Please PM me if the above is of interest.  If there is enough interest I'll set up a poll to finalize spec and start shopping around for someone thats willing to organize a group buy.

I'm definitely interested. Just a question. Is FOC unsensored a thing? I thought FOC needs a sensor to work. And I assume we can't use just any truck right?

I'd guess trucks would need to be heavily modified or use the ones shown.

The guy you refer to is me Timo and I run www.haggyboard.com // meta surf is well known in the local community here. I have not tried their boards. Forging the hangers is absolutely legit and I would not be surprised if they do it within taiwan (as opposed to having them done in mainland China). We also do proper forged hangers made in taiwan.

@Tamatoa: hi there. They are marked “sold out” because I needed to ensure that the ball bearings sit perfectly in the rim. I habe a few sets of rims now for testing and I expect to have all of them  ready for purchase by mid-November. If some of you are interested to get your hands on some sets earlier, please let me know best by email: timo@wertrimo.com // regarding the cost I am still calculating as it will depend on the hard anodizing / and sandblasting process. Nevertheless, I aim to make it VERY price competitive .

About meta surf, they said they only sold complete set ... "The motor will not work without our esc and remote" ... ok but everybody could have a FockBox :smile: ... 
But love the design, motor price look good, like a motor without shaft, so it should equalize with the low kV of hub motor, so more wires...

To clarify....
I threw a random number to him.  If we get like 20 motors, can you make us a customized batch?
Reason (along with lots of assuming)
I am guessing most of us would like sensors
60 amps max is a little weak... (he mentioned this is like the absolute max and was sketchy then)
Of course you can get with or without trucks (he is going to send me more pictures about connection)  Pretty sure if you just get motor someone like @Kug3lis can figure out how to modify or fabricate something to fit it.
Trucks are rated for 200kg and that is conservative.

Again.. PM me.. only gauging interest right now :)

I'm a bit worried about their battery,

[quote="Ixf, post:62, topic:69910"]
There are 2 options for the battery packs both running 13s1p
Samsung 25R (for ALMOST air travel safe)
Sanyo NCR 20700B
[/quote]

13s1p would mean a max safe amp delivery of 10 amps per motor. with the 25r cells, or an even lower number for the sanyo's because they are only rated at 15 amps each. A 2p system would make so much more sense.

[quote="Ixf, post:62, topic:69910"]
Board is set up to run foc unsensored with 20 amps per motor.
[/quote]

This would be very unsafe/degrade your cells fast with a 1p system. are you sure they are running 1p and not 2p, can you maybe ask again?

I think the ESC is good for a cheap build but if it limits the motor current to 20A it's a pity to me. Better to by some small factor vesc and you are done. Even at 12s but with full current will perform better than 13s1p at 20A per motor.
You also have to see which remote it uses.

It depends on what diameter of wheels you use but you can use this calculator to calculate it (use 60kv and 16 teeth motor and wheel pulley so gearratio is 1)

I have found that on 10s with 100mm wheels the topspeed is only 36 km/h and 12s with 100mm is 46km/h
```

---
## \#126 Posted by: rey8801 Posted at: 2018-10-03T20:42:24.745Z Reads: 422

TO get similar top speed you need to use 100mm wheels, so since for the moment the core is ABEC you can go 97mm for 34kmh (I bit less usually then predicted one) or 107mm for about 37kmh. The bigger the wheel the less otrque and with ESC also less braking I believe,

@pixelsilva So basically, you want to promote the pre-orders, no testing, sell to us as soon as possible. I'm okay with waiting 1-2 years until I receive my product? Basically, what everyone already has issues with.

Definitely, not a missed opportunity. A direct drive motor for $90. That just doesn't make any sense. But sure if they are able to provide it.. more power to them.

At the end of the day. More options for the consumer. Better support and service for the consumer.

Just curious why is a direct drive has to be significantly more expensive than normal motor of the same size? Is it because it uses bigger bearings and has a whole lot of extra parts or is it because they haven't made enough of those yet and hence have to charge more to quickly recover the setup cost?

More customized more specific parts.
More parts are upgraded for durability since they aren't being ridden on compared to a regular belt driven motor.
Higher quality material for all parts.
All parts are made from billet aluminum.

You could always make them cheaper. But that always depends on the company providing the product.

I wanted something better. If people don't want it.. that's fine by me. :smile:

We can always buy $90 direct drive motors. I'm game too.

No point in everyone offering $90 direct drive motors (if it's even possible). More options across different price points is great for the community in my opinion.

So you are testing. When are you expecting your Direct Drive to hit the streets? $90 dollars is to cheap for such a motor? Whats the difference with other motors? I got my T-Max 5335 (unsensored) for $55 shipping included; not so long ago Ollin 5065 200Kv (sensored) were on sale for $47... what makes these good outrunner motors so cheap and Direct Drive more than twice as expensive?

Edit:

Oh, you just give the answer :ok_hand:...

looks like a square index, just like maytech/others do on their hub motors.
Thinking about this, it might not be to hard to build your own direct drives.

Take a motor like this: **https://alienpowersystem.com/shop/brushless-motors/aps-6355s-sensored-outrunner-brushless-motor-50kv-1700w/** or this **https://alienpowersystem.com/shop/brushless-motors/aps-6374s-sensored-outrunner-brushless-motor-60kv-2800w/**

Remove the shaft, CNC a part that bolts on the front with a square index, and a part that bolts on the back with either flywheel or kegel adapters. then use a lathe to turn down your trucks to 10mm and file a square index on it.

You could always make them cheaper. But that always depends on the company providing the product.

I wanted something better. If people don’t want it… that’s fine by me. :smile:

We can always buy $90 direct drive motors. I’m game too.

No point in everyone offering $90 direct drive motors (if it’s even possible). More options across different price points is great for the community in my opinion.

I agree with the man... Multiple price points is a good game, and quality control costs money. I've found that in this hobby, a lot of times, even when you buy quality parts there is still high failure rate, because esk8 is a grand abuse of hardware. But quality seems to last longer, so it is often worth the money.

I'm hopefull, but a bit sceptical. 200kg of static force is nothing, climbing carabiners are rated for 2000kg+ for a reason, in a fall you can generate 6-7kn (600-700 kgs) of force without doing anything crazy. I can only imagine going over bumps and down curbs can generate a lot of force

Yeah you guys remember how there were some enertion hub motors that snapped off because they just sit on an 8mm axle with this exact kind of square key?

And now the lever arm is like 3x that. These are doomed to fail with the current design. It makes zero sense to do something like this. If 8mm axles we're strong enough then you'd see ultra lightweight downhill trucks with less aluminum and plain thin 8mm axles to make up most of the hanger. I've seen trucks that have the extra aluminum start to bend with age. If you think these wont do the same, likely to a worse extent, then IDK what to say. I feel like this is completely untested by the manufacturer on anything but a motor Dynamo.

I'm really surprised you guys haven't had a field day on how poor of a design these have.

(actually it wasn't full 12 as it was threaded and long story short it WILL be a solid 12mm going forward starting today.)   but this is a long span for sure on these and likely hardened so more likely to snap than bend.  but at maybe only 300$ for a set that gives you a lot extra for possible medical work later.

its pretty new to me but speaking of hardened axles it seems you can get a hardened axle into a cast hanger or a forged (why forged is worth doing don't know as the aluminum isn't going to be the part that bends and I imagine that's the forged part).   so you can get a hardened axle in a cast hanger as the aluminum doesn't get to the critical temp of the steel to anneal it.  or you could press it.  maybe would anneal slightly

The new carvon torque drive axles are 12mm stepped down to 10mm. They never get to 8mm. Strong as fuck

8mm all the way is a bad idea and 200kg test are a joke. With bumps and cracks, you are going to put far far higher forces on the thin elongated axle and for sure I expect them to snap at some point.

Lets get these guys to go atleast 10mm. 12 stepped to 10 will be ever better.

Just thinking out aloud.

If they decide to make the axles thicker, then they have to modify the motors to have a thicker inner diameter too. 
Thats gonna add to the cost.

Quick update:
@jasonbhuynh
Managed to catch the owner before he went to bed regarding the axle design.
He mentioned that the material of the rod is 7075-T6 (aluminium alloy) and is confident in its strength.
He will look into potentially developing thicker rods in the future but that change is more involved then just modifying the motor and will not be included in the next batch.

@NAF I found some video on Taiwan esk8 facebook page, I'll repost when I get back home.  They aren't torture test though, just running it in front of the store.

Lastly I want to make absolutely clear that am NOT affiliated with them in anyway or form.  I saw the product, its cool, its from my home country, found the owner through a mutual friend and I'm bridging the language gap with information gathering and trying to organize a sale.  I am def getting one personally and will be paying out of pocket for it.

The main problem with aluminum is cyclic loading, that’s happens all the time on our boards

With steel, once you are below certain stress value you can consider that it has infinite life, with aluminum it doesn’t happen, it will fail eventually, the only question is after how long

That’s why you have steel equipment working for decades and the landing gear on a airplane is replace every 500 landings

I wouldn't say it's the main problem...
It's true the aluminum has no hard endurance limit, but it is still very high, like millions cycles high.

The main problem would be the stresses, very good aluminum is in par with shitty steel in terms of yield/failure stresses.
And good steel/alloy/tempered/whatever can be twice or more stronger than very good aluminum.

Sorry for cutting in on this tread... 
There are several replies which speculate on good/bad design or guesses whether this or that diameter is enough.. All have some merit but pointless without analysis and numbers.

Let the vendor present his design and judge on the results and field tests, which is what matters at the end.
I'm also curios to see what will happen with this product, just don't kill it before it had some chance...
I can help with the calculations.

I think 300USD for a set doesn't include international shipping since you're probably bringing them back to the US in your suitcase. Hence it's direct currency conversion like you said.

I tested the board! We went for a ride around the 101. Torque was good, trucks were a bit wide for my taste but responsive. He's very into downhill but also carving at slower speeds so trucks and setup were important to him. The boards are all 13s1p with hot swap battery packs. New controller is not ready yet but soon he says, so he's using the standard nano v2 for now. Here he is![image|666x500](upload://wzrLQr73QZ9hMm4R258my1efU99.jpeg)

Btw he is willing to sell basically any component to the DIY community since he is a DIYer himself. The case can fit 2 FOCboxes or 1 flipsky 6.6, and there is provisions for hot swapping via the xt60 holes on the battery and ESC case. It's pretty well done.

One last bump on polling for interest, I'll be closing poll eod today:

[Metasurf Direct Drive Gauge Interest for Potential Group Buy ](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/metasurf-direct-drive-gauge-interest-for-potential-group-buy/70064)

Ok, some more info from my discussion with him. As a side note, gonna try and meet up with Haggyboard (@riverside.rider) maybe tomorrow? I'll have to message him first though to see if he's available :stuck_out_tongue:

The specs of the direct drive is the following:
* Max continuous 60A, peak ?, but this seems to currently be limited by how much he's actually tested and the phase wires/connector he's using. 
* 60kv, recommends running on 12s or 13s (Metasurf completes are 13s1p)
* 6365 motors
* Unsensored
* He doesn't recommend going anywhere below 90mm, though 83mm is technically feasible. The only concern is motor clearance.

The specs of the esc enclosure and hot swap battery assembly is the following:
* esc enclosure comfortably fits dual focboxes with space to spare and it'll fit the flipsky 6.6 + antispark just fine
* Battery enclosure fits 13s1p + bms. There're a charge port on the battery enclosure so you can charge your battery separately
* 4 thumb screws secure the battery enclosure onto the rail
* battery enclosure -> esc enclosure connected by one xt60

He's willing to sell basically all his parts for DIY, so if you're looking at building a cruiser with swappable battery packs, this is basically your best bet at a nice injection molded/cnc'd enclosure. He's also considering the ability to chain multiple packs together for multiple p's though he said it won't happen for a little bit since he's busy. I also gave him feedback on the very... unconventional deck design. To be honest it wasn't too fun to ride, I had more fun on the boxy cruiser than I did the weird sword thingy. He said he'd change it and that it was really more for experimentation than anything.

Here're some more pics and a short bad video I managed to take of us riding around the 101. Sorry I was too excited and forgot to take a video of the drives up close... though they work about how you'd expect.

but throw someone 200lb+ doing stupid shit on craggly streets and we'll start seeing failures.  we've all seen it happen to enertion's, and they're doing 10mm steel, right?

Me: "How's the flex on that deck"

Other guy: "It's stiff, almost no flex"

_**I step on**_

Other guy: "wow! I've never seen that deck flex like that before"

There's a reason I'm a sucker for carbon fiber like the Raptor 1 and Hummie decks. His offer of $300 seems like a great deal, but aluminum axle is a no go... especially if he want to use this community as testers for improvement. Is he planning to replace these $300 units once flaws are found and he make the needed improvements?

Also @sofu were you guys conversing in Chinese/Taiwanese or English? Any chance of details lost in translation?

Besides knowing how to read menus and ordering at Cantonese restaurants and talking with my mother. I hardly use Chinese.

You should invite him on here so he can see what we have to say. There are plenty of bent and broken trucks here that I fear the use of aluminum on something that takes so much abuse. 

CarvOn uses and single piece of 12mm steel axle, it goes all the way through the CNCed hanger and is stepped down to 10mm. Haven't seen any issues so far, I think that would be the way to go.

Alright guys the poll to shape the next batch of DD motors have CLOOOOSED!

We'll be looking to see if we can get a batch of DD motors with the following specs:
Sensored! VS non sensored
80 AMPs vs 60 AMPs
70 KV vs 60 KV

Once confirmed (Current timeline 10/17) I'll try to work with the owner on getting us a way to reserve motors on the next batch potentially at a discount.  This will NOT be a pre order (I spoke to him he doesn't like the idea either)  Potentially reservation for a small refundable fee if it doesn't ship before christmas.  Unfortunately I highly doubt we will be able to take nuts as payment.. especially left nuts :smiley:  

Trucks and potentially other parts (I actually really like the enclosures.. surprised no one else is asking for them) will most likely be online this weekend.  Will let the group know when it happens unless someone else already noticed it going up.

Another quick note about the motor, it has 3 phase wires BUT it doesn't use bullet connectors.  If you get it now you'd have to make an adapter or split it up.  Next batch (if it does take off) should have separate beefier wires to make it easier to for us vesc users to deal with.

Yeah it does. To be honest I liked the short a whole lot better than the long even though it's the same hardware. It's probably because of the super weird deck shape on the long though...

He's got his vesc settings super low on everything because you don't need high or even moderate settings for city cruising in Taiwan and also because the phase wires can't handle too much, but I think they're capable of much more.

I double that. Even without considering the diameter and length, anyone having screwed a steel nut on an aluminium thread would anticipate the obvious consequences of the slightest user abuse... Sounds like a communication error rather than a design issue :upside_down_face:

Ok here's our latest conversation on that. We've had many conversations about it in person, but the one from chat I can actually show. Edited to take out excessive bantz. Jack is @Ixf. I'm not claiming to agree with his reasoning or deductions, just posting to explain where we're currently at.

Yes. I think I'm going to stay off being the middleman for the axle topic until we have the hardware. Then we can draw conclusions. He's already made it clear that he will fix and improve anything that breaks so nobody is SOL. Let's just wait and see...

@topcloud is looking into getting custom hangars with good steel axles machined. I have a set of Carvon's coming in and a set of these coming in for the sake of science :grinning:.

I'm not expecting much, but if they don't fail spectacularly, they would be a cheaper alternative for those who can't afford Carvon motors and/or who don't ride too hard.

i think many of the members might not be able to understand what the metadrive guy said.

"no problem. if there is any problem, we will help to resolve it.
as for the enertion axles snapping, we did consider it when we were designing the metadrive.

we think that the axle breaks easily is because the axle is too short.
he posted pics of jason with the enertion trucks and said that the axle didnt pass through the entirety of the hanger but only extending it out from the sides of the hanger

therefore their design made sure that the axle passes through the entire length of the hanger.

although the choice to make the axle pass through the hanger wasnt made just because of enertion's problem, but we did some tests at the factory which also prove that having the axle running the entire length of the hanger made it stronger.

as for the axles being aluminum, i will get an official report. as we had signed a contract with the factory that we want to use 7075 aluminium for the axle.

as for the tensile strength and impact force, i will have to see if next week i will be able to provide a detailed report about that"

that is what he said mainly in chinese.

> update: cost-prohibitive at a glance: I'd cover setup costs for a group buy (that someone else runs; I don't compete with or sell to my friends), however, the first shop guesstimates $135 per hanger 50 qty., and, after measuring way too many decks last night, we'd need SR TKP adjustable baseplates for clearance - adding another $150 in cost.  



* Custom aluminum Surf-Rodz TKP-compatible hanger - and (new) likely will require TKP adjustable base (for clearance):

![07111814_596496e77aa52|500x500](upload://1iQBjTuhDPfR2Guqjw3h9D8qFdV.png) 

* Straight-through hardened steel heat-treated axle, 9.525 mm through-body, graduating to 8mm just outside the hanger body

![P1050076|600x338](upload://w2YcAw7NCTDDTqLwSmuHsLwBzzt.jpeg) 


**We are optimistic that Metasurf will deliver**, yet we will always look to our community when we need something more.

If we must have custom hangers made, we'll source them from a forum member - exactly as we did for this custom Avenue hanger for 90mm hub motors, just a few weeks ago:

13S is what's next in PEV; pretty sure all the electric-unicycles, karts, etc. I saw were 13S.  

Metasurf seems on-point.  Do like. :)

smart question; depends on the materials and engineering of the part itself really but when it gets down to it, a floating axle is less expensive to manufacture and is harder to be precise.

@Frenchy

There wasn't any price hike.
The trucks and the drive combo wasn't even posted when the forum first picked it up, only completes and motors were available.  You can't hike the price of something that wasn't even for sale to begin with

The owner actually made an err with the pricing resulting in the individual parts being cheaper purchased separated then that pack and had decided to keep it as it is for the time being for early adopters that want to try it.  If you do the simple math of adding it up you'll notice its at 360 not 490.
Is it expensive? sure.  Is it worth the amount thats up to the individuals to make the call.  If the market doesn't feel the worth is there he will have to adjust.

@sofu got an extremely good price that I really suspect wasn't intended for public.  I won't use that as a baseline.

Again I don't work for those guys, I'm just trying to help here.  More vendors = options and competition which is only good for the consumers.  At the end of the day I echo @Benjamin899 if you think its worth it get it, if you don't think its worth it don't get it.

I'm just waiting for torque boards to come threw with something great to use with actual retail and stock to keep up ..I didn't mean to put anything down.. I'm interested but after trying to buy all morning today and frustrated now and thinking it's really not worth it yet..@lxf if you get the new 80 kv and sensored this will be a better option hopefully he doesn't jack them up even more

I personally will be waiting to see if he redesigns the axles. For carvon prices, i expect carvon quality. We as a community have shown that 8mm axles dont have a place in eskate, between them bending under light weight riders, snapping under heavier riders such as myself (i finally broke my TB trucks) i dont think 8mm's is sufficient for safety reasons

I understand this part I was just flustered by the price change..and shipping is out to lunch..but lxf explained..I seen prices and pics that was only on a website ad from another web site ad hole bunch of ad junk mail ..and the prices were alot more when I finally get to the site.. and reading breifly I seen sofu got them for 300 but now that I  have read it slower and let it sink I see what went on..and we're I failed to read more....so I hope it gos forward with a solid approach..and I think the design will need improvements and I'll be in the group buy if he does do something to improve.. yes i was wrong sorry for going off to fast ...sorry for ruffling you feathers @Benjamin899..but out of it all we found a shipping  flaw sorry again and cheers

So update on the few that have put in an order with me for a set: they arrived at the Taipei shop since yesterday, I'm picking them up today. For the people who are still messaging me for a set, unfortunately I'm at max allotment and max capacity for my free suitcase check-ins so it ain't gonna work out... Sorry 😓 I recommend waiting and seeing at this point anyways.

I'll post more pictures when I get the hardware in a few hours. 

Hey @jasonbhuynh you got a set and I got an Ollin recurve... Let's build a monster 😈

I’m curious how the axle is in that hanger. It’s said to be cast in there the complete length but how does it have those squares at the end?  Are they the axle or another part? How do they end up squared w the hanger and are they fixed/cast into the hanger?  Never seen that on an axle that’s cast all the way. They look like what is typically screwed into the hanger

I took these screenshots from the video. I can't tell, is this just weird camera perspective, or are these axles already bent? It definitely does not look straight to me, but again it may just be perspective.

I'm 99% sure its just the perspective, they filmed the video on a gopro. If you look at the 30 second mark its pretty clear the video is distorted.

Not to say that the axles won't bend. I agree with @lrdesigns, the motor should be flush against the hangar for max strength.  But the owner agreed to fix anything that breaks, and should my set break that'll be the first thing I bring up to him besides thicker axles lol.

Totally not hating btw. I've had 10mm/200mm downhill axles bend on me. These just need to be beefed up if he's going to keep them that wide... i'd say 12mm at least. Even then, maybe I just didn't measure the pixels right and these aren't bent.

Yes we were discussing this as he took me to the airport. He said around 1-2 months he will have a new deck design, and if you have any favorite shapes to let him know so he can incorporate elements. He's actively reading this thread.

He also said he's going to try to make the trucks narrower, something like 218mm. The main hang-up is motor placement but he will try.

If he's redesigning the motor truck, he should definitely have the motor flush against the hangar. I think that would ease up some of the concerns people on the forum have about the design. Also thicker axles but I imagine that requires a motor redesign as well.

Just so he knows, a narrower truck is going to result in more force applied to the wheel.

But that's only the case when you bottom out your turning, and one side of your wheels could begin to lift off the ground. In other scenarios it's the same forces for the most part.

I didn't mean to make a stink about the trucks but might have been better for everyone in the long run 13 inch is out of control..no need if the trucks are designed properly. Now we need him to fatten up those Axel's and I'll buy lots from him. Great job your a real champion to this fourm sofu cheers.I can vouch carvon are very tough I street skated it the shit out of my speeddrives this year he really just needs a 12mm feathered to a 8 mm would be optimal or at least a 10 mm to 8 mm axel minimal

Price went from $90>$99>$149. The main initial appeal of Metasurf was that the motor was considerably more affordable than their competition. That's why everyone got so excited about it. Now they're charging you almost as much as their competition to essentially "test" their unproven products. And you mean to tell me that those trucks are worth $199? But to each his own.

Single, white, fluffy ass female with temperamental mood swings, and alarmingly skiddish nature seeks dapper as fuck, multi color male wearing a bowtie, top hat, or Mickey Mouse ears. Enjoys chewing up only premium OEM phone charging cables, scratching and biting children, peeling out and power sliding on hardwood floors, and anything involving being a batshit crazy feline.

If this sounds like your cat, and you're interested, piss off. She's not interested anymore. 

Wait, yes she is. 

Err, no she's not. 

Damn it, I can't keep up. Why are the cute, fluffy indoor cats always the craziest?

Um Taiwan. It really is a different place even if China says its not. These motors may originate from mainland china so then my point is mute. Not trying to hate, sorry. 

Also many good China motor makers use NSK bearings as they last way longer than the local alternatives. 

I did a google. Turns our NSK has factories in China. Sooo the more you know. ["At present, NSK manufactures industrial machinery bearings, automotive products, precision machinery and parts, and other products at 11 plants in China."](http://www.nsk.com/company/news/2011/press110607.html)

i Wonder if bearings I get are real.  And then it doesn’t seem possible to figure what’s real as the end user or seller. . I wonder if bearings I buy are real. Labels are like money these days but once out of the box, switched possibly, I haven’t heard of a good way to tell.  There are many characteristics but I’d like even just one good test of something.  Shininess. Hardness somehow testable. Or noise. None I’ve seen.  So don’t mean to say these are fake just casting shadows on all bearings everywhere 


Sad to say if it’s cheap that seems the best indication of fake. The cost of a 6808 shielded https://www.qualitybearingsonline.com/6803-NSK-deep-groove-bearings-17x26x5/ is maybe 24$   Her I am again looking at the same bearing looking for a good deal and then deciding it’s too good to be true.  ![image|375x500](upload://jZSsWZJuXFX5XsF2vkBHDf335fV.jpeg) I think u have to go through nsk directly and go through the assured distributors even then not knowing for sure 
Boxes look like money. ![image|375x500](upload://bt5AuekOujeFlYq2VhRzZqkLyVh.jpeg)  https://www.stopfakebearings.com/#buysafely

Excuse me for coming and screaming fake it just goes off in my mind wondering every time I see a brand label bearing.  I bring it up because not long ago I didn’t realize costs and counterfeits were such a thing. So maybe it’s 30$ for this bearing and I challenge someone to find the best price on this Japanese bearing.  At least the louis voitton bags are easy to spot.

I was asking the same question a few days ago, but I don’t know enough about those motors and bearings to be sure if that is doable. Maybe now that we know the bearings number it is possible to find out if there is a suitable replacement. 

Looking at the picture it seems that there is a sleeve inside the bearing maybe we could change just that??

I don’t think you can just replace the bearings. The stator must be attached to something, either the axle directly or a bushing type piece. That bushing would need to be drilled out to 12mm and then the bearings swapped for 12mm Id ones. Then it would be usable on a 12mm shaft... maybe
```

## \#450 Posted by: TowerCrisis Posted at: 2018-10-15T06:19:55.473Z Reads: 326

This is correct, the core doesn't spin and the bearing sure doesn't have an 8mm ID... Bearing is not the bottleneck here, it's the entire assembly.
```

---
## \#451 Posted by: LukePL Posted at: 2018-10-15T07:25:04.221Z Reads: 326

So it can be drilled from 8mm to 12mm. The only problem would be this square part that locks motor to hanger. This whole design can be modified quite easy.
```

## \#452 Posted by: Hummie Posted at: 2018-10-15T14:58:27.677Z Reads: 335

Think it’s a 6803 bearing

If someone opens it and shows how thick the hub part is and at what diameter it’s stator maybe you could easily drill it out for 12mm but then you need a 12mm hanger with the square end and of a certain length and where to get one. You’ll likely need to get it made.  I happen to have a ton of 12mm hangers w 50mm long axles coming out either side. Not square on the end and you’d have to do modifications but could hold you over until some are cast.

Yes, test ride soon I guess !?

It's about 5 x less than the Maytech hub motor (Internal Resistance  0.557‐0.577)? Should be good and less heating. (a 130kv is about the alf, around 40/50mOmh for a 6374). Maybe I'm wrong...
For this low kV it sounds legit, but I absolutely not the one who should/could talk about that ... :sweat_smile:

100 mOhm is reasonable for a 63xx sized hub/direct motor.  It's consistent with the idea that winding resistance grows as (1/Kv)^2, since SK3 192 Kv motors are roughly 16 mOhm.  Unfortunately, it means that if a 6374 system is safe to run at 75 A (or 2775 W), then one of these is good to about 12 A (or 444 W), as they will both produce equivalent heat at those currents.

Hub motors have challenging thermals, and as far as I can tell, there are very few guys that are deep enough in product development to be coming up with solutions to those challenges.

All I'm saying is that none of us have even seen it be tested. Sure that axle has failed in Carvon drives before, but until it's tested than who knows. Wouldn't it be nice to have a new direct drive competitor for a good price? I'm just saying I'd like to be optimistic about it until it's proven. As per the deck.... Yeah the longboard design is shot. The shortboard is okay. It'd be nice to see the drive be decent, who knows though.

I believe everyone here are supporting new competitor on the direct drive category. ppl are just concern about the 8mm axle, which has been shown as problematic in the past. Yes this metasurf DD need to be tested but 
the concept of 8mm axle snappiong is deep in everyone's mind. So unless it has been tested and proven that it stayw together, everyone would prefer a thicker axle to get into the comfort zone. The possibility of the truck snapping at high speed is fearful enough for most of us not to endorse this new product immediately. Personally I am waiting for the test result and a new version with shorter axle before deciding if i wanted a pair. that axle is looooooooooooong man.

Also there was the misinformation about the axle made with aluminium alloy, which wouldnt have made sense at all.

Carvons are on what version now? Hummie hubs? How long has TB direct drives been in development.  None use 8mm at this point. There's good reason.

Initial observations:

They feel really nice and powerful but braking sucks for whatever reason. Motor max at 80, min at -60, battery max at 30, min at -12. I ran the same settings on the same testbench with the raptor 2 hubs and they felt equally powerful to be honest.

Here's some sample metr data for the short ride: https://metr.at/r/slgRf 

@Hummie the esc box is super jank and fell apart 🤣There's a piece of the cover on Market St. somewhere :stuck_out_tongue:

Nothing bent yet, though @Aeroquiv rode it for a bit and one of the motors started making a grinding sound. We figured out it was the axle nut being too tight and squishing the spacer into the motor bearing. I'm not sure if that spacer is required, but a word of warning to the other five who have them, don't tighten the axle nut too much...
```

## \#517 Posted by: Ixf Posted at: 2018-10-20T05:39:10.885Z Reads: 322

Couple of quick notes:

* The first set that went out are rated for 60 amps max.. please be careful with pushing the limits
* The spacer are probably too wide.  As @sofu mentioned, careful with tightening.  Alternatively you can also just drop a stack of speed rings\washers in there.  The spacer is there mostly to make sure the inner bearings of the wheels don't shift too much.  Metasurf has been informed and will be looking to "right size" the spacers

Again thanks @sofu for picking it up

Sorry, to clarify, I meant the following:

On the same settings under load, acceleration felt equally powerful from probably around ~2mph (can't start from standstill)
On the same settings under load, braking is not good on the direct drives. It barely brakes. I'm not sure why this is. Even when you short the three phase wires directly, you can still spin the motors by hand easier than you can spin say, SK8s or the Enertion hubs.

Besides the motors, the rest of the hardware is exactly the same. Same battery, fesc6.6 dual, switch, wiring gauge, nothing's changed. I even ran the same routes. I think that's as controlled as you can get...

Ok as promised, here's the Metr data @Aeroquiv collected today. It is quite powerful seemingly without using much current. Probably because of low kv...

https://metr.at/r/Q6XXR

https://metr.at/r/ZARIz

As mentioned above, braking at low speeds sucks. Braking at high speeds seems to be OK. Not sure why that is either. Torque starting from low speeds was also not great going up a hill. Not super sure why yet, we'll do more testing.

The right side motor on my setup ran very hot today, to the point of burning. The left side motor is fine. You can definitely feel a ton of resistance when you spin the right side compared to the left side. We think it might be a seized bearing because of the issue with the spacer before. Metasurf is sending me a new one right away. 

One thing is the trucks start out very slightly canted, making a sort of "v" shape. Metasurf tells me when you get on it, it should flex. If it was brittle, it would break. You can see a video of that here:

https://youtu.be/fKrphey6Be8

It's apparently normal but we'll see if it works out. 

There were otherwise no problems today on 20+ miles of rough SF roads and a 180lb rider. Everything held up fine except for the right motor which already had a problem. We need more time to see if it breaks though

This is not true.  Sensors just access where the rotor is at start up to enable the motor to spin in the right direction.  They have no bearing on braking power.  When you come to a stop the motor is already spinning so sensors have no influence.

a brushless motor needs to know his position, emf feedback does not work well at low rpm’s.
sensors are very accurate at low rpm. does not mean you get more force but you can brake till standstill and not till 1mph or so.

Chuck enough amps through a motor and sensors become unnecessary.  Mine start fine from a standstill not when rolling backwards though.  Then they need full wack.

These motors are pretty cool but I don’t understand why the trucks are so wide. 

Ideal would be shorter axles with offset core wheels. That would allow for a shorter axle but keep the wheel width wide.

Metasurf will make a "stronger truck" "as soon as possible" with either "high alloy steel or titanium alloy for the axle" and make it thicker in the process.

Be cool to see the inside of the motors and we could figure if they could be put on a wider axle  because the plan of going to a harder alloy or titanium I don’t think is a solution and they’re not going to get a strong enough 8mm axle that can survive all the leverage. Luckily it didn’t snap if it already is a hardened steel as they tend to snap not bend

So it only took 50 miles to bend these trucks. 

So far, I would say these motors are okay for what they are. Torque was as expected for 65 kV motors. They were not as strong as Raptor 2's, however. I reckon that they would be a bit better if only they were sensored. At 10s, 65 kV is just too damn slow. 12 or 13s suits these motors a lot better.

Speaking of sensors, I do not recommend riding these un-sensored, especially up hills. I'm not sure if it's a quirk with the Flipsky vesc, but they required a good amount of speed to detect rotor positioning, and if you were not careful and didn't push fast enough, they would cog and throw you off the board. This would also cause problems trying to climb hills, because once you hit under the 8 mph threshold, they would again, cog and come to a complete stop. 

Braking is pretty strong at speed, but low end is extremely lacking, but again, I suspect this is more of an issue with the fsesc and not the motor itself. I had the same problem using the Raptor 2 hubs on the fsesc.

Further testing would need to be required using more reliable motor controllers. I didn't realize this was more of a vesc issue and less of a motor issue, so I didn't prepare any focboxes before I bent the trucks and returned them back to Sofu. :rofl:

I just got my set to work tonight.  
Did a quick test on 10s lipos with focboxes running foc.  
I did have to push start to get it rolling.
It didn't feel different from the last time I ran an uncensored though, give it a little bump and it rolls fine but yes.. I really miss hall sensors.
Once it got rolling it was really smooth.
The brakes didn't feel too soft, I wonder if the softness was due to the focboxes vs flipsky 6.6 duals.

on topic of braking.  On focboxes, brake was smooth until the very last moment where it seems to completely cut out.  Guessing this is a function of sensorless as the motor looses track of positioning under certain speed threshhold.  Another thing to consider when on slope.

I'm really curious here.  Do your logs show you actually hitting the -60 motor -10 battery?  Trying to understanding why the F6.6 is being soft.  
Is it that its not pulling the amps from the motors that matches the setting
or is it just actually pulling the amps from the motor but just processing it differently.. (Is this even possible..?)

Hi! To unswer your question in my case. After increase the braking from - 50/-6 to - 60/-11, on each vesc, it does brake now. I think fsec 6.6 has some soft limits so you need to give it more room to work. By the telemetry o can say that mlst of the time it brakes generating - 5, - 6A each vesc for 80% of the medium strong brakes. Once I pushed harder and got - 17 total from 2 VESCs.

Well I am usogn a firefly which does have a lot of throttle so no needs of adjust the throttle curve. While I when I was using a nano-x I alway use the adjusted curves. Anyhow before to adjust you need to reach a setting that allow you to brake. Otherwise won't help anyway.

Meh, ideally you have just the right amount/size of spacers that you can torque it down as hard as you like and it will lock the wheel onto the hangar with just about zero play and free spin. It's never a good idea to run without the right size spacers and nuts tightened down all the way, because the small amount of play between the axle and bearings, side to side and all around forces on loose bearings in the wheel cores all cause additional wear and additional unnecessary unpredictability in grip breaking into slides. Even with a direct drive, I wouldn't feel comfortable with my wheel/bearings not able to be fully torqued down.

That's just my experience, and why I think a lot of people's bearings die out prematurely, why Abec11 came out with built-ins, and also why zealous bearings exist.

OK, so here's the latest deal from Metasurf.

@jasonbhuynh Can you remove the kingpin and see if it's actually bent? He strongly suspects it's actually not a bent kingpin, but a rushed mold that makes the kingpin sit sideways. If you can remove the kingpin and take a pic, we can be certain. 

That being said, he's redoing the trucks. The following is what he explained to me, translated to English:

In the interest of not leaving you with broken parts for a while, he's going to split updating the components to 3 stages
1. He will first order a new batch of trucks with fixed kingpin holes and titanium hardware. At this stage the axle will still be 8mm, just titanium. The kingpin hole is skewed because the factory rushed he says. Estimated time to shipping on this stage is 1 month.
2. He will redesign the truck with the most common requests thus far. 10mm titanium axle stepped down to 8mm titanium axle, and a reduced width aiming for 210mm. Estimated time to shipping on this stage is 2-ish months from now because new molds need to be opened.
3. If necessary due to truck changes, he will modify the motors to accept the new trucks. This would apparently happen along with the new trucks. These motors will be sensored.

There's no cost to the 6 people who paid to be guinea pigs :stuck_out_tongue:

8mm titanium? are you sure that will be enough? a few different direct drive makers have settled on 12mm.

[quote="skatardude10, post:1604, topic:25251"]
I got curious and did a little simulation between fully threaded, partially not-threaded and partially threaded, comparing between 12mm and 14mm axles for each, with 4142 steel under 500 lbs-force load. Here are the results… it looks to me like threading plays a large part in losing strength… for example the fully threaded 14mm axle is pretty much equal in strength to the 12mm partially threaded.

Keep in mind that the results shown are visually exaggerated for visibility, the max displacement on the weakest axle was ~1.5mm total for reference under the 500 lbs-force load

I have no idea. I'm only relaying what he said to me. Hopefully it'll work, but that's why the guinea pigs are testing :stuck_out_tongue:

@Frenchy I have no idea about pricing. He didn't mention anything. I imagine we'll have to wait and see...

We've strapped them onto a bustin maestro with a koowheel system and they're torquey as shit. Top end is mediocre at best obviously. Just waiting for the axles to break. I swear i can fell them flexing when i stand on the deck.

yea good torque, but max speed at 12s full charge was barely 25mph.

which makes sense at 60kv

That sucks about the damaged item, but I'm sure it'll be corrected. As far as next steps as far as I'm aware he's sticking to the plan I outlined here and doesn't expect too many complications: https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/metasurf-direct-drive/69910/621?u=sofu

Once I get more information about the new corrected trucks I'll let you guys know. My guess is this time it would be more cost effective to simply ship individually from his warehouse in Taiwan. Like I said I'll follow up with him 👍

Sorry about the late update guys, I got this information a bit ago but just forgot to post it. I'm sorry about that!

Basically what's going on is this:

New molds have been opened. However, he just went directly for the completely updated trucks to save cost. What that means is that he's skipping the inbetween 8mm stage and just going straight for 10mm. New hardware is expected in three months, at which time he will need everybody's address who wants the updated version so he can directly ship you the updated hardware, which is basically a new set of everything. As previously stated, there is no cost to the end buyer for these new hardwares. 

I'll make sure to keep y'all updated properly as things progress, though I expect to have no major news for around the next month which manufacturing progresses. I'm in constant contact with him and he's super nice and will answer just about anything, so HMU if y'all got any questions~

Edit: So strike what I said about the timeline, it was a misunderstanding on my part. The initial order of events remain, but timeline is extended.

- 3 months out from titanium 8mm axles with fixed molds
- ? months out from 10mm axles and sensored motors
- Timeline after titanium axles to be decided later

The rest of the above still applies of course, new hardware at no cost to original buyers, etc etc!

Hi, I am very interested in getting a board from him possibly soon. I am new to boarding, so I may be saying stuff wrong in this message (in case I do).

So, it sounds like if we buy a board from him now, will will get the upgrades you mention for free once they come out? AKA, it sounds like the trucks are an issue and too thin. So, they will be upgraded from aluminum to titanium in 3 months, then 10mm sometime later this year with sensored motors. Then some other update later. We will get all these upgrades shipped to us once they come out?

Also, is there a way to Private Message you about this board or to pass something along to him? Again, new to this community so not sure if this is possible on here (seems like not from looking around. Or it may be that my account is too new).

The free replacement parts thing is only for the people I picked up parts for when I was in Taiwan. They’re “testers” so to speak. If you buy viva his website I don’t think you will get any replacement parts unless you contact him via email directly.

@sofu , thanks for your reply. I think then I may hold off on buying from them then unfortunately until they make there forks (again possibly using wrong name) thicker. I guess people are saying the current measurements are too thin and can get bent. 

Has that been the general experience so far with testers? That it eventually bents and breaks? I mean, is there a simple alternative, such as just buying the motors and attaching them to something else instead? Again, new to this, so not sure if that is possible.
```

tl,dr. the axle currently is 13" (too long), only 8mm in diameter (too weak), made of ~~7075-T6 aluminium(too soft)~~ some steel, cant (V-shaped) and designed to flex under load.  They are fixing these issues and with 12mm axle made with titanium. Also the motors are only 65kv so a little be too slow.

To clear things up...

Axles are currently 8mm steel.
First step will be replacing them with new hangers with **8mm titanium axles.**
Thicker \ stepped axles will follow later.

As for their completes, their boards are running 13s which puts their completes at around 30mph which isn't breaking any record but plenty for most consumers especially on the short board.  Also take into consideration these will most likely have pneumatic adapters in the future.  

Early adopter will receive a set of **_replacement trucks._** as enhancements will be made on the baseplates as well.

## \#675 Posted by: LukePL Posted at: 2019-01-28T14:30:07.104Z Reads: 279

Once its ready and tested there will be an update.  
I don't have details at this point but the owners are determined to make it right. 
I asked him multiple time... over coffee and over beer.. you really replacing all the trucks?  He pretty much said ya, its the right thing to do but please be patient.
Of course if the testing goes poorly there may be a pivot which may translate into more waiting.
It would be pointless to provide everyone with a replacement that doesn't solve the problem.

Wanted to keep everyone up to date.
Unfortunately I still don’t have timeline for new trucks but I did receive news that they have engineering samples.

![](https://scontent-ort2-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.15752-9/s2048x2048/60422865_2069873969983811_6058099384447401984_n.jpg?_nc_cat=110&amp;_nc_ht=scontent-ort2-1.xx&amp;oh=ab30e932dc9929cf36548023ce438363&amp;oe=5D70F4C5)

These are 12mm step down to 10mm. 
The manufacturer threaded the whole length of the 10mm section in error.  The actual production trucks will only be threaded at the end.

No more mold changes are needed.  The sample will be tested for fit and strength.
Once that is done a small batch will be made for those that had previously purchased from metasurf.

Once I get timeline I’ll keep this group up to date.

Semi unrelated.

ABEC adapter compatible.

Again just engineering sample, no timeline yet for public availability.  Fit + Strength to be tested soon.

Paired with metadrive (60 kv) you'd probably hit ~40 with 12s.

The tires fit their DD which utilizes abec style adaptor.
In theory this should work on all abec style drive train.

This was a quick test on their existing board with their old truck.

I like em - despite the lack of sensors.  And...it's another thing taking up space in my closet so I'd like to put it to some use, or get rid of it.  But can't get rid of it with floppy trucks.

Either way, thanks for the update, looking forward to it!

Pretty sure next batch will be sensored.  I can double check but the engineering sample they were messing with were sensored.  

Thanks for being patient.

Is there any reason why the hangar must be that long?

Last time I checked they had QC issues with the production batch and are working on getting it resolved.
I will be heading back to Taiwan mid September and will probably be visiting them personally.  Sorry I don't have better news :frowning:

no worries, good or bad, sounds like stuff's still happening.

got to ride with MoeStooge and got some pointers on how to address it for the short term.
