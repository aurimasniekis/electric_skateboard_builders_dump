**"How lazy do you have to be to need an electric skateboard?  Can't you just push it?"**

You're right.  It is pretty lazy of me to design and build a custom electric vehicle from scratch; one that goes 30mph with a 20 mile range and weighs under 20 pounds.  Textbook lazy.

Needless to say... I don't think I will be seeing her again :sweat_smile:

Ive found my gf doesnt understand why i do half of my crazy ass projects! Or why i spend so much on them. I just tell her me spending on those is the same as her spending on shoes and clothes ... mutual agreement we'll never understand the others likes is the key ;-)
blindly calling it out like that is pretty closed minded imo. Each to their own! 
Number deleted?! ;-)

Lol. This coming from a girl who swipes at a phone to find a date. You don't even need to get off the toilet to do that. 

Keep fishin' bro. :punch:

Better to discover this utter incompatibility early on and be done with her. 

Oh, and I think it could have been even worse, like "Skateboard, in your age ...????"

well usually i don´t talk much on an tinder date :monkey:

last time a female friend of mine saw a board of mine and told me the same "haha lol you´re a lazy ass! Why would you go electric on a longboard?!"

i didn´t say something but took her out for a ride. 
she´s now saving money to build her own ;)

i would have thrown a drink in her face and walked out. Not a word, no warning, just drink in face and GTFO. 

I'm sorry, but the power of the vag just isn't that strong when you've got two hands and you know what makes you happy.

In all seriousness compare esk8 to makeup. 
Wow you're so lazy, so you have to paint your face everyday with chemicals to look good

This sounds familiar. I came with eskate ja my friend with car. He said that I'm lazy because I don't kick my board forward. I said to my friend why she doesn't push her car.

+1 on this. Classic "Anti-dating". She was trying to get you to react. She wants your D, bro...:thumbsup:
If you want to screw with a girl's head all you have to do is look at her in the eyes, pause, and with a slight smile just whisper the word, "fat".  Then say nothing more... LOL  Women are conditioned with a Pavlovian response to that word. Enjoy! :wink:

:joy::joy::joy::joy::joy:

She was upset because she wants you to spend your time and money on HER and ONLY HER not the board. I get this from my wife when I go to the range 2 x per month for IDPA. You'd figure after 17 years of marriage and 10 years shooting IDPA she wouldn't care...WRONG. "you don't spend enough time with me" she says. I say" you don't spend enough time with me NAKED!"!

Awesome dude that you go to the shooting range. I live in pussy ass libtard california so I have to go through the hoops to buy a gun or even shoot a semi-automatic and register it. Good thing I know some guys that help me out for free. Keep up the 2nd amendment m8

No one has ever taken me up on the offer.

That's why many of us here love our wives/girlfriends. One of my favorite quote from a radio host is "To love is to understand and accept one's passion and addictions without necessarily participating or being turned off by them"

Some women needs time to understand this. Asking why you can't just push is fine, it's what they say after you explain the awesomeness that matters. If people thought like her, cars would've never taken off as people would ask why we don't just walk...with that said, did you pay for the drinks or meal? Or did you take her route and ask why she didn't show up with a sandwich?

My sister-in-law makes a six figure income, 200k, and she's on all the a dating apps. Her expectation is that the man make at least 100k AND buys her the $3000 dresses, $1000 shoes, fancy restaurant meals....basically all the things she splurges her money on now, because she's a woman she shouldn't have to pay for anything she says. Classic case of "what's hers is hers and what mine is hers"

Are we creating another forum here.. I think it would take off. It should  be a gentlemen only forum. Let's call it "WTF WOMEN". Any other name suggestions?[quote="Mikenopolis, post:21, topic:12054"]

That's the type of woman you tell "you're not that good in bed babe". The sad thing is that they will find some needy guy to do exactly what they want. Then women like that loose all respect for the guys and dump them eventually. Classic narcissist.

Well it started off esk8 related. It does look slightly bad for me since I'm not exactly fit. REALLY should at least be biking instead.
