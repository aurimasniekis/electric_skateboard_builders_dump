Hi All,

Just thought I'd let you all know I was in Melb City for a conference. Each night I decided to hit the paths with the e-board and on Friday Night I was about to turn around and head back to the hotel when I saw what I thought was someone riding an electric skateboard. So naturally I followed with the curiosity of what track is he going to take? It was a reasonably good bike track that went for at least 2-3kilometers I think. We exchange looks of (you know what's up in todays world) as we passed each other. When the path came to an end at the river he went over the bridge as I turned around as to not get lost. On my way back what should happen? I pass another eboard heading in the opposite direction to me. Again that same look was exchanged.
Has this happened to anyonelse?
