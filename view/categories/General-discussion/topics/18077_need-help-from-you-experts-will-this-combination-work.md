I just want to make sure these things will all work together to make a decent E Board?

I have done a lot of reading and heard of a lot of different components IE Anti Spark, BMS, etc.. Does it look like I have everything I need or are there other components I am missing? 

Are these components plug and play or do I need additional cables/components to piece this together.

I know I have a lot of questions but I just want to do this right the first time, Thank You!!

Sounds like it would work, other than you need a switch

The space cell 4 has a built in switch, is there another switch I am missing?

The battery does have a switch. You do not need another one. 
I would not use a winning remote. Search around. I think they are well known to be unreliable

Could you give me a recommendation, looking for something smaller.  Doesnt matter if its trigger or thumb controlled.

This combination will work, so many build are based on this setup.

If youÂ´re looking for a similar, get a Benchwheel remote or the Enertion nano-x
