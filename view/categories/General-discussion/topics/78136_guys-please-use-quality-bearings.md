Hey guys, just a reminder to use quality bearings on all of your builds. While riding 20ish mph uphill this happened, luckily, I am safe and sound. 

If anyone got extra SINGLE 107mm wheel, I am happy to take it out of your hands. Or anyone wants three wheels, let me know, rode less than 30 miles.

The wheel didn't actually fell off the hanger before I stopped. Pulley and belt probably held it there for that couple seconds. I felt the rear is getting really bumpy, probably the feel of rolling on a square shaped wheel, then I looked back, the wheel is flopping around, first thought came to mind is I broke the axle out of the hanger. But it's the bearings. 

And thanks for your concern, I didn't fall.

I had this set of bearings on the shelf for a long time at least half a year, but I just put them on this morning before I went out for this ride, they are new, just been sitting there for a while. I am not sure if they are from China, but the bearings says "ABEC7 608RS" on it.

I wonder if these wheels could be modified to fit on a set of carvon 2.5? I can check the cores of mine to see the modification needed. It would be for a 4x4 build.
I'm in the UK and would be interested to see if it would work, for science of course.

Did you have the appropriate size spacer inside your wheel? The only times I've seen cores melt is when the bearings get seized from over-tightening them without a spacer. The spacer needs to be at least the same width as your core.

I just had the same thing happen to me yesterday. I was riding around 5mph and the wheel just kinda popped off. I was using some shit-tier bearings from some flywheel clones I bought a while back. When I inspected the 7 remaining bearings there was so much slop that you could wiggle the inner race 5 to 10 degrees. No signs of rust or wear, just all around terrible bearings. Will not be making the same mistake again!

@PXSS I definitely used the spacer between two bearings in the middle of the wheel. And when I tighten the axle nut, I usually go tight it up then back out 1/4 of rotation on my wrench. 

@kylepls Sorry to heat that happened to you too. mine is still pretty tight no wiggle on the remaining. They are on there less than 20 miles.

As for my bearings I cleaned them with 90% iso achocol and wiped them down with a rag to make sure they are dry. Then I spray all the bearing parts with oil and put the bearings back together. 

You need to remove at least the rubber seal to get the oil in there.

The deal is you got to use spacers because you really need to tighten your wheels down solid to help prevent speed wobbles. You can get spacers on eBay, Amazon or your local skate shop. Or, if you want really good heavy duty spacers you can get them from here:

That is why I bought custom spacers that fit Abec11 wheels and clones. .405" length is just right. Plus, the larger outside diameter and thicker wall makes them much more durable and stable.

I'm not sure how good it is for bearings specifically, but white lithium grease sticks and it will stay in your bearing. I would also suggest using something specially formulated for bearings such as Bone's Speed Cream, which is meant for skateboard applications.

Not a fan of ceramics. When they fail they fail catastrophically. 

Get zealous bearings it's $14 for a set and they come with built in spacers and a Nano ceramic grease that they claim will make the.bearing roll smooth even if it developes imperfections. 

They also have ceramics for $27 but I have not tried it. 

They are on sale on Miurskate  for 12.99

@Battosaii is right in my experience.  The speeds and start/stop stresses are too much for ceramics.  The shatter and cause the bearing to seize, which causes the wheel to seize which causes you too fly like a crazy person and land on you face...which is not a good day :slight_smile:

I've seen this happen before with those cores! In my years downhill skating, companies that use cheaper plastic cores can actually melt from overheating due to tons of resistance and friction in cheap or rusted bearings.

A buddy of mine actually fell really badly because his core melted and the wheel fell off while we were doing about 35mph.

Solution: maintain your bearings (don't buy cheap) or get wheels that have a heat resistant core!

I have lost a front wheel before due to my own failure to lube my bearings.  My experience is most bearings will come with very light lube. Best to pop the seals and grease those balls right out of the box. Since we are riding powered boards it is easy to overlook a bearing that needs some love.

I suppose that's true since e-board maintain a pretty constant speed. Doing downhill is pretty intense for a few minutes, but the ride back up to the top of the hill lets them cool down.

Either way, i've seen this happen several times to Abec and Sector 9 wheels, but not other wheels like Seismic who put tons of testing in their cores.

What are you doing to your bearings.. :O days. But very true ceramics will shatter with large impacts. But the impact would still deform a metal bearing either way you are replacing a bearing. Keep in mind i only way 60kg so i stress less.Though still bent two 8mm axles. :S

@Battosaii  I use to run Swiss Ceramic for years. Swapped last year to zealous ceramics when i replace mine i'm buying some more zealous ceramics. Its really hard to justify that extra cost of Swiss Ceramics now.

Seeing this post made me drop everything and go lube my bearings, so I did. I took my bearings, bearing covers, spacers, and shims, and I put them in a cup of acetone and shook them for a bit, After, I let the acetone dry while the clean parts rested on a paper towel. When dry, I put teflon silicone lubricant in the bearings and reassembled it. Works better than new.

I learned recently not to put grease in skate bearings because the ball bearings in the bearings have a very small contact area with the outer casing, so something thick like grease would actually slow it down. For skate bearings, thinner lubricants should be used (liquids). Remington gun oil sounds like it would work really well.

Careful with that, most silicone lubes aren't designed for high pressure.
Also, grease is usually fine, especially for Eskate.  Zealous are some fast bearings that lots of people ride for DH which are filled with grease. The limiting factor for speed becomes air drag pretty quickly.

What nitride coated bearings are available anyway? Is it just the bronson bearings?

On topic. You just need something slightly better than bottom of the barrel dirt cheap skate bearing. 

I found industrial bearings to be quite good and long life if packed with grease. And are so cheap as to be disposable. 

Any half decent branded skate bearing will be good. But there are skate bearings so cheap that they barely roll. Think kids walmart skateboard bearings. They are much lower quality than industrial bearings. :open_mouth: Probably similar to what OP got. 

Before I went to 10mm axles I used bones red (race) they include a spacer. They work perfect, quite durable and reasonably priced.

I would not use ceramic balls on the powered wheels, I have seen enough guys on this forum blow them up for it to not be worth the risk. Id rather buy a cheaper bearing and replace it once a year or when ever needed.

Iâ€™m in contact with a bearing company that does
Hybrid bearings that use silicon nitride. Currently @b264 is testing a set in his winter elements.

I felt this exact way and have blown them up myself.  We'll see how these hold up.  Unfortunately, the better they are, the longer it will be until we know the results....

Ceramics implode catastrophically.  No warning just disintegration.  All new bearings no matter the quality deserve your attention.  How many do you think they check at the factory QA process?  Pop those things open and grease them up.  As for regreasing I'm with @mmaner who has the time.  Change those suckers out.  I buy good quality scooter bearings because they are the strongest and use tap grease.  It has a high water resistant quality.  Less likely to wash out

I afraid of bending up the seals taking them apart, because the ones I have taken apart it's too easy to put dents in the seals so they don't fully seal anymore

With the boy and his antics I have become somewhat of an expert on bearing maintenance.  He goes through them like a champion.  Nothing puts more pressure on a bearing than a kid landing from 6 feet up sideways all day long.They take a lot of punishment and nothing we do compares tbh.  I use a scalpel or an old fashioned razor blade to prise the shield off and re pack.  The very best bearings I use for him come from a company called apex over here and they are a pro scooter firm.  They use true abec bearings not the chinese copies and they last.  Longer than any other I've tried.  The local scooter shop owner actually imports his own now and they are a great unit too.  I don't have the inclement weather you do so as for water and brine ingress no, but for sheer destruction the boy has no equal

Well then you're just going to have to ride them harder.

Get yourself some slide wheels and start power drifting.

The bearings Iâ€™m getting from the company that @b264 is testing use true abec ratings as well they have been doing bearings for bicycles and Iâ€™m the first person to come to them for bearings to be used in a skate application. Thus the reason I past along my discount to b264 so he can subject them to the toughest conditions and if they survive his daily use in tough conditions then they are the real deal. 

I talked to the company about the bearings exploding and they said they could see ceramics exploding because the Zirconia isnâ€™t a regulated item where silicon nitride is more regulated because it is used in medical applications. They also said that if there is a blow out if they can see some pictures of it they will send out replacements for the blown ones. So that isnâ€™t a bad deal.

I see the use of quality ceramics being a plus for us.  Especially the guys in snowy conditions.  Absolutely and Brian is your man for that test.  I think the issue with ceramics so far is the same old chinese bollocks.  We just don't know what we are getting most of the time but if high end car manufacturers can use it for brakes and guns can be made of it then surely if its quality we won't be able to kill it.  My only tester causes impact damage not general wear and tear via weather.  Oh and I have 100 scooter bearings sitting in my workshop lol

Damn it, I bought ceramic bearings a few months back for my build. I didn't see much information on bearings really when I was scouring for information on things. You guys got me all paranoid. I suppose that'll be one of the earlier things I update on my board.

All the other ceramics I had worked fine.  That is, until they didn't.  I'd rather a bearing get tighter and tighter and squeaky until I change it -- like steel ones -- as-opposed to the balls exploding abruptly.  Try riding home on that stuff, it sounds like a blender inside your wheel and it keeps grabbing then letting go, trying to knock you off

But hopefully these new ones won't do that and I will certainly find out.  No news for a long time is actually good news.  We should know by April or sooner...if they make it through a season and still roll nice, I'd consider that a win to be using winter bearings in the summer
