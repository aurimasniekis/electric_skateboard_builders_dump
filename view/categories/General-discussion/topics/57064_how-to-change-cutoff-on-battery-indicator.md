Anyone know how to change the cutoff in which the battery indicator will show zero?
Here's the one I bought:

I think the cutoff is preset at 3.6, how could I change that to something around 3.4 or 3.5?

Very simple - put those 2 wires to your battery pack pressing button on the left (function key) and then you will have some letters, first you will have to enter your battery pack type (Li-po, Li-ion, Ni-Mh ect.) by pressing  buttons, next you will have to enter how much batteries you have in series (i have 4p10s battery pack so i put in 10s). After you have set everything you have to cut off power so inputed settings save. Good luck. Sorry for bad English, im doing my best...
