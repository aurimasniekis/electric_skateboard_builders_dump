Has anyone tried wrapping a bike tire around a hub? Securing with some sort of epoxy? 

Not sure if it would work, is it worth a shot?

There was a guy that did it on reddit, secured it in with a screw.

Unless its glue directly to the wheel, i cant see how they are secured. If it requires gluing, then whats the point? just use propper AT wheels that arent going to catastrophically de-laminate at high speed and cost you some skin.
They look like it was applied with a caulking gun :joy:

But, but...

Hub wheels are already just tire skins over the hub.

Why put a skin over a skin over a hub, when you can just make an a hub wheel tire that's offroad from the get go.

Hey everyone.

I'm here to try to clear up some answers for you. The Tread Wraps have a lip that covers each side of the wheel which won't allow it to slide off. They have been tested and filmed (as you can see in some of the videos on the Kickstarter) to ensure they don't slide off. Of course, the image you see isn't the final version. We still need to make the molds for the final production run. This is why we're raising funding.

Not sure how I got the reputation here for being a scam artist, but that's not here nor there. I'm happy to answer any questions anyone has.

Do you have any videos demonstrating the complete board off-roading with the wraps? All your videos showing the off-road capabilities are framed to only show the back quarter of the board.

Definitely seems questionable...

Those misshapen treads, Can't take the product seriously looking like that

Seriously though....my four year old could of designed this

My biggest concern is that these will fly off your wheels when doing 40+ km/h. Speed or milage isn't mentioned anywhere. These coming fresh and untested from the factory will surely get people wrecked. Materials don't last forever. So even if they hold up well (which they won't), eventually they will break at the highest stress point during your cruise, which will be at your top speed making a turn. This is dangerous and all your alarm bells should be ringing here. CAUTION DO NOT BUY

These will either be impossible to put on or come off way to easy at high speeds.

Why back when you can just make them yourself out of anything.  It might take 3 years for you to get the one from the crowdfunding.

haha. You're not wrong there. The prototype was just to prove the concept. Naturally, the final product will look nothing like this and will be made in a factory with proper molding and materials.

This was just to prove the idea and ensure it will function without flying off, will actually get traction, etc. We just need funding in order to get a production ready, finalized product that can be sold.

I can't say I use these forums very often. I made this account to gauge interest in the product and get some useful feedback. Which I am getting plenty of.

Good finds. That is also accurate. I used to skate as a kid and a friend of mine let me ride their Boosted awhile back. Naturally, I thought it was awesome. So I decided to start my own brand and get involved in the community a bit. Of course the more comfortable I got riding, I wanted to be able to go off-roading. So I came up with the Tread Wraps concept and am here to see how feasible it was. My prototype worked much better than I expected so I figured I'd see what everyone else thought. I know not everyone will like them, but I appreciate all the feedback everyone here is giving.

I thought about this concept and bought these wheels: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07484JGBQ/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1

I planned to core them to 90mm and glue it to the diyeboard 90mm hub PU. Even found the the glue that could work. However, the difficulty of precisely coring and the questionable quality of the wheel material stopped me from following through. Plus, I didn't have confidence those hub motors can be pushed hard enough without overheating. 

Unless there is a powerful and resilient motors that can adapt to larger sizes, this concept won't work. Also what's necessary is the programmable ESC like VESC. 

BTW, those wheels turned out to be complete crap. When ridden at 20+ mph they heated up and disintegrated from the inside.

yeah I think he forgot to calculate the change in diameter of the wheel resulting in the KV of the motor now being very inefficient and at the same time insulated further from heat dissipation...the entire concept was obviously dreamed up by someone not harboring the experience or tools on the subject. If you wish to make wheel thane for hub motors that replace the crap on them, you would be better off and fill a niche by solving a problem....these things don't solve a problem that needs solving, nor do they add anything..in fact they hurt the situation, and considering they are marketed to people who purchased cheap hub motor eskates, it appears they are banking on their consumers being ignorant or foolish and to me, as an eskate consumer, that's insulting...insulting products are never gonna to far...while producing the things we are asking for is helpful...so start there, do your research...
