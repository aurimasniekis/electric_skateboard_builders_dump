Evolve is like an angel investor to me at this point.

They didn't even change the box. Can you imagine the range on flats with this thing with a decent pack? ITs only got one motor. Many efficiency. 

Maybe i should just add it to my list of evolve mod options now to troll them since its not even released yet.

its a comedy of errors! I wonder what they plugged the second phase lead port with. Or if they bothered.
