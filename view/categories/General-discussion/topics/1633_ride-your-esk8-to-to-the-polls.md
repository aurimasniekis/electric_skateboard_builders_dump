Here in the US it's election season for our new president. I made a point of riding my eskate to the polls, hoping it might remind us of the need for lower-impact transportation options. I believe that positive transitions begin with dedicated folks like us taking small steps to get the word out.

Anytime someone asks about my eskate, I take the time to explain that a part of the reason I use it is because I don't think I need a car for most of my short-distance travels. I try to spread the word.

There's my [build][1], created with the support of this community, outside after voting! @onloop @longhairedboy @chaka @psychotiller @lox897 @lowGuido @torqueboards @siggs3000 @trbt555 @RunPlayBack

you know it! Ride that shit every where! People always ask about my boards when i'm riding, and its a great chance to talk about PEVs and what they could mean for society. I make small grocery runs on mine all the time.

Awesome @longhairedboy! All the better that you're picking up diapers! As a Dad myself, it's good to challenge the expectation that longboards and skateboards are only "for kids."

Nice! I'll be sure to do the same once the circus makes it out to Cali. You really can't tread any lighter than an EV this small.

I ride mine to and from work every day as long as it isnt raining. I hang it off the side of my desk and people are always interested in it when they walk by.

I hope you both are riding tandem on one board. That would really send a message and solidify your unconventional "position" on eSk8's. Lol 

(My brain is still trying to formulate a visual for what that would look like. Processing.......)

It's performing extremely well so far @NNGG. I've got about 55 miles on at this point, no issues at all. It climbs hills like a champ, starts from a dead stop. I can't really imagine it being better, but time will tell.

I use a backpack, so small amounts of groceries only. But i can also carry 2 or 3 plastic bags while riding, so i can get quite a bit of stuff.

@locktight I'm the same as @longhairedboy; I use a backpack. I'm not talented enough to hold bags of groceries while riding, I find that they swing around and mess with my balance. I can manage shirts from the dry cleaners, but not groceries.

i once rode home from walmart with an entirely new bed set. I'm talking about that giant plastic zipper bag stuffed with a comforter, pillow cases, pillow covers, tiny throw pillows, sheets, and a bed skirt.  I also had a gallon of milk. 

I'm sure it was at least mildly entertaining to watch.

Who's gonna be the first to strap a wicker bike basket to their board? 

Or how about a second board hooked up like a trailer, but with a front caster wheel/truck setup like a Freebord, so it turns with you as you ride?

There is a skateboard that you can buy that has a craptastic electric setup and has a backpack permanently mounted to the deck. I think it's this:

@TF22 Hey friend, I don't mean to play moderator, but the term "chink" by most would be considered a slur that shouldn't be used in a civil discussion, if at all. I understand that you might not be aware, but in the U.S. it's an insult to our Chinese friends. Please consider editing. You'll find that the members on this board are a cheerful, helpful, positive group, but we take equality seriously.

Sorry for my lack if knowledge, I was not aware of the full meaning of what I said, but I had a close friend actually test the Eboard out. When he came back he, didn't say happy things about their product.

I bought mine at walmart, $4 each, collapsible. I ride with 50lbs of groceries sometimes and these bags have lasted over a year so far. 

I also use shower caps to cover my wheels when I need to take the bus. My locale requires that wheels be covered on boards for safety. 

Corona for scale, do NOT drink and skate!

Shower cap on the wheels? Safety? Skateboard Condom?

I could reason it if your board was like this one üëáüèº üòÇ

The requirement for bus transport in Las Vegas is that skateboard wheels be covered by bags so that if you drop it it can't roll around and bang into ankles. The shower caps are so that I'm not wasting plastic or keeping a wad of dirty grocery bags when I go somewhere, and the collapsible bags serve the same purpose. I actually was planning to build a second board into a trailer for pulling groceries but I don't want to carry two boards around while I'm shopping.

A trailer idea sounds a little scary .... How do you prevent the trailer oscillating/fishtailing if it should start....slow down? is it possible to jackknife if you slow too quickly? Humm curious myself abt the idea .... Not so much for towing food... But kids lol .... Everyone Get On the Skate Train!!! CHOO CHOO !
