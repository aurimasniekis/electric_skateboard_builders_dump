Hello, I want to do a group ride this Sunday the 18th. The plan is to meet up at DeForest Park at 10:00am and start the ride at 10:30am.

DeForest Park
https://goo.gl/maps/hN9Rh6css4Q2

The ride will be 12 miles down the  LA river bike trail to the Belmont brewing company for a bite to eat (or drink.)  Then ride back the 12 miles return trip for a total of ~24miles. 

Everyone welcome. There should be a charge spot at lunch location. Will have a tow rope just in case. Let me know if you'd like to go
