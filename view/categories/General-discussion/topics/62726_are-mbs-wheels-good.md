Hello! I was wondering what you guys think about the MBS all terrain wheels (100 mm).
I know some people had problems with them in the past and since here in EU they are like 80-90 euros, I wanted to hear an owners oppinion first before throwing my cash away

They're okay once u break them in... initial riding will feel bumpy

I use them on both my eskate and non-powered skate

Agree with @Holyman92, they are quite uncomfortable in the beginning. However when they are worn down they are really grippy and feel great.

I love them. I've had 6 pairs with little to no issues.

Thank you guys! I'll definitely buy a set (black). Since I live in a city with a bunch of cracks MBS wheels sounds awesome for me

I am not  a fan, they fell like crap when they are new.  Once they are broken in they ride pretty good but bu then they aren't great for dirt or gravel.

Mine are worn weird because I'm a fat ass and keep bending the axles on my TB trucks

I bought a set and returned them for abec 107s right away. They were so wobbly! I get it, they are for skateboards not high speed vehicles, but they felt a little toy-like in comparison to the abecs.

MBS on caliber II vs Abec 107mm on evolve trucks. No comparison. Abecs are amazing. I will try to shave down the MBS and see if that makes them feel better but I exclusively ride street. But huge price difference.

I don't have ABECs to compare them with but they are better than the clones I have.
I shaved mine but to tell you the truth did not see much of a difference ![20180724_200729|374x500](upload://oCA2hRkJNjYCjZgysxuSkVQFLwm.jpg)

....hummmm... @Holyman92, is probable you are not a goofy foot (you a regular)? If you are indeed a regular, you are riding with your left foot at front and that's causing your (rear-right) pulley wheel to wear down. Instead, you should ride with your right foot at front (and your back against the rear-right pulley wheel) to avoid wearing the MBS.

Aaaa OK. You a big dude. :smile: But regular foot also contribute to wear down that right pulley wheel.

That's one of the reasons (me goofy) for the rear-right position of the Tacon Bigfoot under my Pintail....

I think they're fantastic. I prefer them to ABEC11 because they track better at high speed on uneven road surfaces. Less tramlining.
