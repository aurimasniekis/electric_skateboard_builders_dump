Drove 6 hours to Austin TX to ride around for the weekend and broke my belt the first 10 min into the ride... if anyone has a spare in the area or knows where to get one that would be amazing! Ill obviously pay!

Is in Austin

The owners @hyperIon1 and 2  are members on the forum. They seem to have 325mm in 12 and 15 widths in stock. They might have a 315 as well. Would hurt to ask. 
Good Luck!
