So typically to use hubs you need to have special trucks or file down your hanger to have that square. 

What if we take @psychotiller's approach and make a press-fit adapter for hubs to be used on calibers, SR's, etc... we could essentially use hubs on ANY truck w/o hours of hand sanding/filing.

right... we could double drop boards using hubs for ultra stealth builds

I've been thinking about this with psychotillers press fit mounts alot. Especially since axle length can be changed so easily with SR trucks.

How does this press fit witchcraft work then?  Trying to get a close look at the mounts and the site is not a good pic.

so my idea would be, a square peg bored w/ an 8mm hole for the axle and basically have that attached to a sleeve that fits the profile of w/e truck you're using so when you screw ont he hub motor it locks into the square peg and the sleeve locks into the truck using the wheel nut to hold everything together

It would be cool! Except for the hubmotors part... And your setup would be like 1 1/2 feet wide.

An adaptor then. Male female thing?  Good idea.  The amount of material on the truck side will have to be quite considerable though, especially with surfrodz.

Maybe use smallest sr hanger available. 
I'm not crazy about hubs myself. Can't justify giving up all that urethane

Yeah, and note, SR supplies 80mm 10mm axles and spacers now.

@psychotiller this is my current setup no motors

330mm axle tip to tip

right! So to do hubs, have proper urethane and not have a board that looks like a waterbug, you'd need to use press fits on the smallest hanger they make. I think you'll still end up at around 380mm

You sir are a genius.  That press fit thingy is the bollocks.  Just tipped my hand towards surfrodz for definitely now.

@dareno tillers mounts are true "press fit"
You can see why I was getting irritated with other products that claim to be pressed fit.

why would it be so wide? the Maytech9055 motors are only 55mm wide and actually for SR's u wouldnt even need to make a press fit hub

You have the ability to take and make a modified axle using their 8mm axle conversions

Add the width of the hub adapters and wheels if you're going to use real wheels. 8mm axles are no bueno. They'll break and/or unscrew those axles when you brake or accelerate.

Im confused by the real wheels part.... i thought he wants to use his maytech hub motors on the SR. Dont those have the thane around the motor?

By adapter I meant something like this @psychotiller, it will fit like ur current press fits only instead of having a mounting wheel it will have a square peg for maytech hubs 

![15392090289821473582226|375x500](upload://hxKD3XA9e4ogzv9LnIPsjAJCmRl.jpeg) 

Like a sleeve with a hole for the axle to slide through

Oh okay, that can be for the 218mm TB trucks since they have strangely long axles lol 

As for SR u can make a shoulder bolt 10mm to 8mm and machine a square peg so the motor could slip in

Probably work out cheaper in the long run actually if you factor in the shipping.  Can't find a supplier here yet.

I bet if you were biting the bullet and buying tkp and rkp with mounts at the same time from tiller he'd make it worth it.
Its a big purchase but man do these trucks feel great.

2 dealers mentioned in the surfrodz find a dealer page and neither have them.  Awesome.  When I do go for it it will be for the complete set up so @psychotiller will be getting the order without a doubt.  Just can't justify it yet due to massive wallet bashing that has occurred lately.  :neutral_face:
