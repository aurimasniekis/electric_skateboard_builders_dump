The esk8 range calculator shown below:
http://esk8.today/2016/12/28/how-far-can-i-ride/#rc

Is wrong...it states that a lipo should have a charge of 4.2 volts, whereas it should say 3.7 (maybe 3.86). The site uses this as part of the calculation, so beware!

Lipo can be charged to 4.2, 3.7, or 3.86 volts.  Range calculations are always EXTREMELY rough guesses anyway.  They can vary by up to hundreds of percent by their nature, so that difference is negligible.  On the same esk8 I can go 30 miles or kill the battery in 5 miles depending on how I ride it....

4.2V is the max charge voltage. 3.7V-3.8V is the nominal voltage. The cell remains at 3.7-3.8 through most of its charged and used state. Look up “discharge curve” of the cell you’re curious about. Most lipo will only be at 4.2V for a fraction of the discharge cycle.

it is a reference to the nominal voltage, which gives an rough but somewhat reliable estimate.
@treenutter was faster and he explained it better^^

@b264 @treenutter @Benjamin899 my charger cuts charging at about 3.86 volts??? What should I do? The charger is:

Now that you've narrowed down the issue, maybe you wanna chat get the name if the thread so as not to confuse new builders?

I use some power supply i found laying around the house...I don't see how that would be the problem
