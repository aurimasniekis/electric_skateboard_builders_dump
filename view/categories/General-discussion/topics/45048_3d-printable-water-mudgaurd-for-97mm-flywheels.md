I made my own design in fusion360. My board features 90mm clones and caliber trucks.

you can get the files, but they tend to break quite easily when using PLA, just got ABS in the mail and I am going to try that out, see if it holds up longer.

are you using caliber trucks btw? then it is an easy fix, otherwise it will be hard for me.
