I've been riding on 83mm flywheel clones and ready to make the upgrade to Abec 11 wheels.
I thought I wanted to go with 97mm Abec 11 wheels but I read @sl33py post about the 107mm new Superfly wheels from Abec11, that seems amazing.  I am running dual 6374 motors with torqueboard extended 218mm trucks so it should be possible with a 12mm belt setup.

Both wheels are in stock on the french Evolves site and I can't decide what to go with. If I decide to go for the new Superfly I will have to get a 40T pulley.

Has anyone tried riding these new wheels?
What are your thoughts, 97mm Abec11 Flywheels vs 107mm Abec11 Superfly? 
I read about a potential group buy on the wheels, any updates on that?

you could even fit 15mm belts / pulleys.  i've got these 107mm superflys, 218mm TB trucks, dual 6374 TB motors and there is still ample space.

i've been going on and on about these wheels:

Nice! You are riding enertion motor mounts right? 
After seeing those monsters on, I am leaning towards the Superfly. Chrischaputt also said the riding feels on those are reallt good :) 
Seems like you got unbranded, where did you get them? :)

I put the 107mm superflys on my evolve Gt and met up with about 10 other evolve riders. Everyone who tried the superflys really liked them.

i contacted ChrisChaput directly, went to Abec headquarters here in southern california and picked them up directly.

i know you don't have that luxury so i'm afraid you'll just have to wait for them to become available in EU.

@ChrisChaput  You said this in another post:
http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/hub-motor-urethane-riding-qualities/27818/463?u=karma
regarding a possible group buy.
How many people would you need to make a group buy possible for the poeple on the forum?

I've been riding 97's genuines for a while and have tried evolves 83 mm flywheel clones, generic clones of all sizes, mbs wheels, and nothing compares to genuine 97's .  I imagine the 107's are even better, but haven't tried yet but i trust they are also superb.  No wheels are as smooth as genuine flywheels, and i say that without exaggeration.   You've got a hard choice to make but I don't think you can go wrong with either.

I would love to try the Superflys but I really don't want to go over 90mm.

Hill climbing torque. 
I'm already running 15/40 gears with 90s and I don't want to give up any Torque. 

Wheel bite. 
I like my downhill decks and I'm already running 1/2" risers to avoid wheel bite.

Both good points. 

But I bet you're a big guy, for those us that are sticks it works well. 

I run 107mm supaflys, 15/40 pulleys, dual 6374 and it bombs up hill no issues. 

Also no wheelbite on free ride decks:

195lbs
And I like the look and feel of down hill decks
Also I like the responsiveness of smaller wheels. 
I was running 83's for a while.

I might run into wheel bite problems on my deck with too large wheels now when I think about it. Going to 107 from 83 is huge I can assume. I will probably try 90mm Abec flywheels and see how they are :)

[/quote]
I have been waiting since before the 107's where released.
In fact, Ive been waiting since Chris and I first discussed the need for softer wheels for Eskates and the Superflys where still in planning stage.

Guys can anyone comment on difference between 97mm and 107mm ?? 107mm with 74a duro sounds god damn tempting.

Been using 97's on my CGT since I got it. Swapped to the 107's a few weeks ago. Rolling resistance, vibration dampening and shock absorption are all noticeably improved. It was an excellent upgrade imo.

@BigBoyToys Did you put those 107's on your v3's ?

Nope, i only have a dual V3 board running at the moment. Ill try them on the quad V3 build when its done in a few weeks. Its definitely too much wheel for just one pair of V3's. I had to increase the drive ratio on the Carbon GT to get it to move normally as well.

o shit, blast from the past.

deck's long been discontinued.

https://www.muirskate.com/longboard/completes/15381/landyachtz-tomahawk-freeride-skateboard-custom-complete

they've replaced it with other freeride decks.

i'm still a fan of hummie's decks:
