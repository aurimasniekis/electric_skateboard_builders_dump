Why do most drop through holes have a funny shape? They're not just a slot, but they have an wider spot in the center. I'd prefer the simple slot—leaving as much material as possible—rather than cutting that extra width out in the middle, if it's not necessary.

Thanks,

It’s to give the hanger clearance when pivoting. It all depends on the thickness of your deck and what trucks you’re using.

Great. I'll start out by cutting a simple slot, then widen it in the center if I need to.

Thanks!
