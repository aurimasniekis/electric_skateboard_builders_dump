Group buy going on right now. http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/europe-gb-wheels-trucks-motor-mounts-battery-pack-vesc-switch-controller/13419. They are not Abec 11, they are flywheels.

i wont believe it until you actually have them in your hands. ordered TWICE now from vendors who claimed to have 75A - one order got cancelled after 4 weeks, the other told me a few days after that they in fact didnt have 75A, but 78A!

Fair enough, but they went through all the hassle getting the exact shipping cost to Australia. But yeah who knows, could be a false stock in their system. Anyway, If they were a bit cheaper I would have ordered a set. Instead, I ordered 78a's from Evolve Australia. Bit worried about this one tbh since I have not received any shipping updates or tracking number ....

These are 78a ABEC's according to the product description? But better than nothing ... :wink:

Evolve USA do sell 97mm/75a, just saying:

Is there so much difference between 75 and 78? I would be happy if Evolve would ship me the wheelz. Have not heard a single peep since two weeks. Damn ...

Na these .... (can't say it) pretended to have them on their website (this is Evolve Australia btw.) but apparently they are out of stock!!!!! Now I will try to get the wheels from Canada (not that much more expensive tbh.).

Cheers
