Lol, search much?

It's like the #1 trusted go-to shop for batteries out there. 
If youre non EU, use https://ru.nkon.nl/ for prices excl VAT.

i second that, also one thing to note that they ship once a week only on monday so if you order on tuesday you will have to wait a week until your order is shipped.

If you're buying from outside EU you don't have to pay VAT, yes. So they made it simple and made a separate site instead of deducting it from the total of your order. Looks better that way I guess and less confusion. 

If buying from EU you have to pay VAT. 

That site is not a short cut for us that just want to pay less. ðŸ˜‚

Im with you on this. I think they only ship once a week. @koralle is it actually with a carrier or just a tracking number?

When you all say EU, are you talking about Europe, OR The European Union? 
There is so much confusion around this, and no one really seems to know the difference..

also the shipping cost is very low. if you choose the cheapest option they ship your order with bunch of other orders and then its handled to your domestic shipping company when it arrives. its abit strange but im glad they figured it out to make it cheaper.

Like I said, don't wanna buy don't buy... What's your problem ;) As our shop is official company it is required by government to pay taxes, the tax exemption requires specific form to be provided to tax administration which we do not provide as it has specific requirements which increase the prices and etc. Not every EU country handles the EU rules the same ;)

Thanks for clarifying @koralle @Acido . 
Many people around here just throw the word "EU" around, and have no idea of what they're talking about.

In my country Australia we pay import tax of 20% where applicable... but that is not the point, I'm not in the Eu so I don't need to pay Eu tax. I mean I buy from Jenso or LMT and get the tax removed... just looking for a even playing field. & it is not like I am cheap if I am buying from the aforementioned suppliers, it is just principle.

Yeah, you pay taxes while importing the goods (if you're unlucky) ðŸ™„ but not via the seller.
```

it depends on value of imported goods of course (sometimes sellers are giving fake value to avoid taxes)

when I got package with 2 focboxes they made me to pay over 20% of tax...so it depends :slight_smile:
