I really would like to see Enertion's new "Coming Soon" Board that looks like a mountain board (ATB??) that would be a All Terrain Board. I have been watching Jason's Youtube videos and really have been enjoying them. I am about 130kilos or 290lbs so I will need a lot of power or torque as I understand it all. I also wonder if Jason is working on a board similar to the "All Rover" but for us BIG boys. I would love to hear from you all,  as I am a newbie and have not be on any board. I live in Missouri and I swear skateboards no not exist, or maybe they are just hiding. :) PS would love to hear from Jason.~Andy

I don't think @onloop is going to release an ATP soon.  Its been awhile but the last I heard was that Enertion had a few more projects on the board before that happened.

If you want a good mid-level mountain board look at the MBS Comp 95, talk to @korryh about motor mounts, @torqueboards @JLabs & @oriol360  about motors & remotes and batteries.

There's really no such animal.  Lots of math and CAD work if you talking about fabricating a board.  If you want more info check out the [builds section](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/c/e-board-builds), tons of completed builds to look at and most contain a 'shopping list'.
