I know I haven’t been active for a while now but I still follow the hobbie. Socal Legend was in an accident on his way to work this morning. He was on the crosswalk and was hit by a car at 15mph according to his instagram story just published around 15 mins ago. So far he has 3 broken toes and was pretty banged up. Prayers for speedy recovery!

Dang well I'm glad he's okay for the most part. That really sucks. Imo if you can ride in the street and keep up with traffic it's much safer than sidewalks and crosswalks. When you see a driver that's about to f@!k you up I make eye contact with them to make sure they realize I am there. I don't ride on main roads with speeds above 30mph that way I know I can keep up or pass traffic. Even after every precuation anything can still happen.

This is sad to hear, hope for a speedy recovery. 

This is why I started wearing a helmet, not because I don’t crash (which I have), but because when you’re up against a car you’ll always lose.
