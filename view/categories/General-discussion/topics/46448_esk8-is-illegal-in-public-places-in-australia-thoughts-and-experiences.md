# Esk8 is illegal in public places in Australia. Thoughts and experiences?

So since I got into esk8 a few months ago I've been under the impression that electric skateboards fall into the "Wheeled Recreational Devices" category and were therefore legal on footpaths not specifically prohibiting skateboards/rollerblades/etc and roads with a speed limit of 50km/h or less, no centre markings and no median strip. I've ridden my board on footpaths and the road a number of times and so far no one has paid me much attention (though little kids like to point and yell "daddy! daddy! look!"). It's been fun and a great way for me to get at least a small amount of exercise in my lunch break without coming back horribly sweaty.

Just now I discovered (through my own research) that esk8s are actually specifically prohibited on all public footpaths and roads (at least in [NSW](http://www.rms.nsw.gov.au/roads/registration/unregistered.html), [QLD](https://www.qld.gov.au/transport/safety/rules/noncompliant) and [VIC](https://www.vicroads.vic.gov.au/safety-and-road-rules/road-rules/a-to-z-of-road-rules/scooters-and-wheeled-recreational-devices)). I believe this must have changed sometime in the last year or so. This obviously sucks because I now know that I'm technically breaking the law. NSW (my state) is of course the dumbest and most "nanny state" of them all, and even specifically prohibits segways on footpaths. That's insane. I think it goes without saying that people in suits that only drive BMWs and want the entire road to themselves are not the best people to be making these laws.

I know there's at least a few Aussie esk8rs on this forum. What are your thoughts on this? Do you specifically try to avoid being seen by police? What are your experiences? Have you ever been pulled over? Fined? Board confiscated? etc.

Right now I'm just trying to decide if I should keep spending money on my board (which I can't legally use anywhere except private property) or if I should not risk it and just part it out and sell it. Alternatively I could start working towards making it into a mountainboard, since I do actually live on 20 acres and have a bushland behind our property with some good fire trails. I'd appreciate any suggestions as well.

I have been skating in Sydney for almost two years now and have done almost 2000km I skate to work in the cbd each day. I skate past the police station every day. Never had any issues. Occasionally they will do a blitz. For example they had cops set up across the Anzac bridge and a couple of eskaters got caught. I think it was an 80 fine. 

Its all about approach. Dont act like an ass and no one will bother you. The cops have far more important things to do then fine you. So dont speed through darling harbour. Or skate on inappropriate roads. There will be others here that have had issues with cops in Sydney. But I think everyone would say it’s very rare. Wear a helmet. Skate sensibly and I also wear a bell (stupid Sydney cycling law) that way I feel far more comfortable.

I'm in northern NSW so not Sydney, but from doing some more googling it sounds like that's the experience most people have. As long as you're not a moron about it you should be fine. I also always wear a helmet, both for my own protection and to appear as though I'm being sensible (which I am).

Thanks for sharing :)

"Don't be an asshole" covers most situations, but it sure is annoying that sometimes the cleanest (and safest to everyone around you) non-animal-powered transportation ever invented is sometimes still prohibited.

I can't give you that. Despite some googling I have been unable to work out if it's possible to find specific bits of legislation without already knowing the name to search for. The best I can do is this, from the NSW RTA (or RMS, whatever it is now) page:

![image|690x459](upload://yxw8RVMARL3N7FwYFt4hVGYiwvo.png)

The [QLD page](https://www.qld.gov.au/transport/safety/rules/noncompliant) also specifically states motorised skateboards are prohibited, but in a decidedly less professional way. You do bring up a good point (that the RMS page might not be accurate, which is what I assume you're implying) but since I don't have any better way to find the current laws I tend to just assume the page is correct.

I've decided I'll continue esk8ing in the same fashion as before (especially considering how much money I've put into this so far), but being prepared for potentially being fined or having my board confisk8ted. I'll probably start working towards a mountainboard as well anyway because that sounds like a crap tonne of fun :P

Not providing people an option to use an excellent form of transportation is unrealistic.  Law makers need to realize taking people off the roads in cars makes life easier all around.  It seems the comprise would be either road or sidewalks but make limits to it. Like if you're on the road you follow bike rules. If on the sidewalk make it so pedestrians have the right away or set a speed limit to protect other people if someone riding an electric vehicle runs into them.  Just saying "no" is weak.

I completely agree with everything you said. Small electric personal transportation is a very realistic vision for the future. Not to replace cars, but to supplement them and reduce our reliance on them for short distance travel. Luckily, in a similar way to how the iPhone and subsequent explosion of mobile internet use through smartphones forced lazy software developers to once again start taking notice of the amount of data their software used, the slow but sure move towards more eco-friendly cities will force law-makers to begin to find ways to integrate alternate forms of transportation into the current system. It gives us a strong argument for the inclusion of electric skateboards and other very small electric vehicles as legitimate and legal methods of transportation.

New rider from Melbourne here, It was about a year ago when the legislation was amended here in Vic (Vicroads) to outlaw the use of said devices on public streets & roads, we can thank those shitty "Hover boards" for that and the issues that have caused for the esk8 image, Im hoping to ride my new Trampa emtb to work and back on nice days when my cars are in more pieces to care for, There is a large police presence near my workplace in Moorabbin, I guess ill have to see how it goes!

Ted from Trampa mentioned something yesterday when we were building my board about big legislative changes in the works, For the UK anyway.

Aus is pretty slow with the upkeep on this sort of stuff, itll be interesting to see how it all pans out

Never let the state stop you from doing what you want. If you are not affecting others, do you. You will be the one who risks getting hit by a car. I can't stand unnecessary government regulations. The thought of you selling your parts in fear of legal repercussions is silly. It means they're winning. If you get a ticket, fight it. Use it as a tool to enact change to the laws.

@Jedi Yeah I don't have the time nor the money to fight a ticket, especially if the law does indeed specifically prohibit esk8s. It's really not silly to fear legal repercussions. That's like saying "not counterfeiting money for fear of legal repercussions is silly". The point is, if you break the law there's the potential to be punished. I don't want to be punished and I don't want a record.

No, but it's supposed to be an accurate representation of the current legislation. Don't forget this "roads authority" is the government organisation that handles vehicle registration and driver licensing, among many other things. It's their job to provide up to date information about the current road rules.

Except that according to the website it would count as use of an unregistered vehicle on public roads, which is a lot more than a parking fine. It's worth mentioning that I've never had a ticket of any kind and I'd like to keep it that way.

That's incorrect and untrue. See legal facts below. I explain along the way.

Do you specifically try to avoid being seen by police? What are your experiences? Have you ever been pulled over? Fined? Board confiscated? etc.

Passed 3 or 4 police cars the one night, on the sidewalk, with my board _covered_ in LED lights (testing out light rigs) and LED strips. As some have said, people stare, so the police slowed down, stared, and drove off. Nothing happened.

Slippahodge is _mostly_ correct. 

**Always read the law** yourself on austlii.edu.au. **Print it out** and **carry a copy with you at all times** incase you're pulled over and need to argue your way out.

I have a bit of legal training and recent experience with various NSW courts (in Sydney) for personal car & motorcycle related offences (as they're called). I'm here on ESK8 having fun building alternative transport because I've had my drivers license suspended for ~9 months (3mo + 3mo + 3mo) and fined ~$2,000 + ~$500 in for lawyer fees per court day. I cannot drive my car on any "road related area" nor ride my motorcycle, without risk of being caught and jailed. It's horrible. I'm basically on home detention.

In each case I was partly right but mostly wrong. The first time I was summoned, via. police highway patrol. The next time I _voluntarily_ elected to take a fine to court to contest it and argue truth for the truth's sake, and ask for leniency for low income. In highsight, I regret both and regret ever going to court. The only person who wins is my lawyer, who is paid and has nothing to lose but his reputation.

Respect the law, and don't break it, but also don't be intimidated by courts if you have to go. If you've kept the law, you will be fine. The law and the courts are there for everyone.

Know that courts are basically a group of people making decisions on behalf of the government / monarch (who don't have time hear everyone's case personally). There's a judge, police prosecutor, the court officer, the typist, and your lawyer all in one room. They're all colleagues in that sense and they chat amongst themselves (sometimes sociably, sometimes aggressively), discussing possible solutions, and eventually arrive at a suitable decision / verdict / penalty / recommendation. They discuss the facts of your case, the law, and your circumstances. The police prosecutor presents an antagonising case against you, telling the judge how naughty you have been, while your lawyer basically grovels and presents a case to defend your actions, explaining your circumstances, what happened from your point-of-view and presents evidences you may have collated. However, they mainly make a very general summarised assessment of your 'character', with extreme prejudice. A good lawyer will communicate this better than a lazy one.

E.g. The magistrate at the first court was polite, courteous, understanding, and sympathetic, letting me off the hook without penalty. At the second court he was condescending, hot headed, hostile, snide, cynical, very smug, and penalised me harshly, even sending me a _second penalty_ in the mail, adding insult to injury. At the third, the magistrate was mature, wise, calm, intelligent, highly empathetic, compassionate, and just, absolutely by the book. He let me off with the minimum penalty and undid the multiple penalties the previous judge tried to pin me with.

_The law is discussed_, but not as much as you'd imagine. They focus on the important bits only. 

The judge, having the most power in the room, can act with discretion, meaning he can do whatever he wants, within certain limits. He can:

1. Make an example out of you and your case with a _harsh penalty_, 
2. Give you an average penalty, or 
3. Be lenient / sympathetic / kind / merciful / gracious and let you off with a light penalty, e.g. a minimum fine amount.

**About the RMS:** At each of the courts I attended, it seemed commonly understood that the RMS / RTA is infamously inconsistent / confusing / inept / has double standards / utterly unreliable. Does that mean they that cannot be trusted and have no authority and you can ignore their info? No. It's your reposnibility to check all the info and laws and rules, etc _before you skate_Then, if you're ever in trouble, you can truthfully explain to the policeman or magistrate what happened, and he may let you off.

E.g. You can explain how the RMS info does _contradict_ the legislation / road rules / understanding, and he may or may not accept your explanation.

Ignore jdnicholson. Ignore Jedi. -- The law is the law. Their opinions are subjective. The law is _objective_, either you are within the law, or you are outside the law.

Also, police are people too. They can be zealous die hard rogues, corrupt Dirty Harries, or friendly Mr. Local Policeman, sweet, soft, and gentle, smiley Mr. Policeman. But cops are cops. Some cops love their job, and remember every crime or potential crime they've spotted. This type will make it their life mission to catch everyone, _including_ _you_, at some point. Some cops dislike their job and slack off, but nowadays, cops have _quotas_ to meet! So they need to catch / fine _x_ number of people per day! Issue _x_ fines per day!

Rumour has it there's a zealous policeman in my local area who's reputed to fine 'everyone' and defect everyone's car, always going out of his way to catch someone. People talk about him like a great white shark. Apparently he fined his own wife! Apparently he sits and waits for people to pull out of their driveways! Surely there's _some_ truth there, but it's most likely an exaggeration. But I do know of policemen who have coordinated with other police cars to chase down motorcyclists (hoons), Pac-Man style, chasing them down, cornering them, and boxing them in. And they're almost always extremely aggressive, over the top, and sometimes violent. 

On the other hand, there's officers who are very gentle, very placid, and 'by the book', doing their shifts and clocking off at 5pm on the dot, but because they have no legal training, and maybe semi-illiterate, they tend to mistakenly give people misinformation, feeding them lies, and penalising them incorrectly. That would be injustice, so you'd want to contest that at court. Unfortunately the courts tend to side with policemen...

Police also record _everything_ nowadays. They wear cameras and voice recorders. Their cars have cameras. Their roof racks have cameras. So, it's very difficult to contest a policeman's accusations unless you can prove beyond reasonable doubt that you're right with the same kind of evidence (witnesses are useless in these cases).

That's right. Stay low key. Avoid the police. Avoid the courts. Keep your record clean.

Legal battles are way too expensive and waste A LOT of time, energy, and money. It's not worth it unless you really really really want to say something and have your case heard. 

[quote="Sippahodge, post:30, topic:46448, full:true"]
... its not a criminal act to ride a skateboard you won’t have a record if they fine you… it would be like a parking fine.
[/quote]

That's untrue. It depends on the circumstances of your case, i.e. whether you were caught on the road, on the bike path, on pavement, on the footpath, on public or private property, etc, how you were riding, whether of not you endangered somebody, etc. 

Also, it depends on your legal history, and _who_ finds out that you just got fined. If the info gets into the wrong hands (one day when all gov't databases are synchronised _and_ highly unregulated...)__ life will become a bit like Minority Report and you'll find that a small fine can trigger something much more serious.

E.g. If your drivers license is suspended, or you've been issued a CAN notice recently, and thus, you're not allowed onto a 'road or a road related area', all it takes is _one zealous policeman_ to make you're life into series of criminal court trials. Maximum penalty is something like one year in jail and $3,000 in fines.

Or, if you're on a good behaviour bond, or something like that, and one of the conditions of your bond has anything to do with roads, driving, walking, riding, skating, etc, and even if you _remotely_ breached the conditions, you'd risk getting into serious trouble.

Ignore Clonkex. That's untrue. As mentioned above, you cannot rely completely on the RMS. In this digital age, stuff gets easily outdated, updated, improperly uploaded from the database, etc. 

E.g. Whilst my drivers license was suspended _by the RMS_, the RMS website ('My Wallet') had no information on this, even though the My Wallet system is there to tell you whether or not you can drive, and what is on your account, etc. Also, the RMS database (at the RMS branch) had no information on this. Also, the police database had no information on this. _Only_ the RMS head office knew my license was suspended. In fact, when I went to the RMS and told them all these problems, they didn't care that much. One of the attendants at the branch even insisted that I was _not suspended_. I then asked for a written evidence which they refused to supply it. 

Also, I actually took a screenshot of my RMS Wallet and submitted it to one of my court cases and the magistrate dismissed it, invalidated it, smirked at me and laughed. He didn't care, nor did he acknowledge My Wallet (albeit from a 'government organisation'). All he cared about was the police evidence.

The point is, if you break the law there’s the potential to be punished. I don’t want to be punished and I don’t want a record.

That's right. 

**Warning to Australian esk8ers:** My lawyer, who is excellent, and is at court almost every day, firmly recommended that I 'do not ride a skateboard on the road because it is _illegal_'. That was his response to me asking him how do I get from my house to the bike path. Instead, he suggested that I ride an electric bicycle. 

I'll elaborate below, on how my lawyer is partly wrong, but his advice should still be taken because it's _current_ and he knows the vibe right now since he's in and out of courts everyday.

[n.b. Sydney is very bicycle friendly nowadays since parliament & Sydney City Council have pro-bike groups. Unfortunately, skateboards and esk8 are unfavoured. Since the 90's they're seen as a pest, while bicycles are seen as 'healthy'.]

[quote="septicdank, post:37, topic:46448"]
one of the cycle cops actually asked where he could get one, and I offered to build him a board.
[/quote]

Don't trust a policeman just because he's friendly. Their job requirements change day by day, case by case, and their job is to catch people. They do what their boss tells them to do. If you go to court and listen to the conversations the police have amongst each other you'd know what I mean. They swear, snicker, and cackle amongst themselves.They're police _before_ civilians. It's their life. Even the softest ones can and will turn on you. Remember Nazi Germany.

**I would print the following out:**

Highlight the part saying: "...skateboards... may be ridden on footpaths unless signs specifically prohibit them, however, riders must keep to the left and give way to other pedestrians"

Highlight this too: "On separated bicycle and pedestrian paths, foot scooter, skateboard and rollerblade riders must use the section designated for bicycles, but must keep out of the path of any bicycle"

And this: "skateboards and rollerblades can only be used on the road during daylight hours". 

* This section is your defence _against_ anyone who says 'skateboards are illegal on the road', including my lawyer, and probably any court in Sydney. But, this is defence none the less, and at the very least will make a judge compassionate and understanding. It may even save you from getting fined by a zealous policeman! 

And this: "They cannot be used on roads with a dividing line or median strip or a speed limit greater than 50km/h, or a one-way road with more than one marked lane"

* As long as you are going under 50km/h you'll be fine. Also, make sure  the policeman does _not _have a LIDAR reading of you doing 50kms. If he does, don't even bother arguing. There's no point. At that point, SAY NOTHING. NO COMMENT. Take the penalty notice and call your lawyer asap.

As you can see, it's very much a 90's law, worded very generally and subjectively to describe anti-social skater behaviour... Do not "obstruct, annoy, inconvenience, cause danger to any person". If a zealous policeman wants to penalise you, he can. The burden of proof is too difficult to prove if you were'nt endangering anyone. Basically the court would take the policeman's word against yours because it would sound like he's protecting society from wreckless anti-social skaters ollying off stairs beside grannies, nose sliding beside workers eating their lunch, bombing hills while old ladies are crossing the road, etc.

**However, this is the bad news. The Road Rules 2014 under the Road Transport Act 2013:**

- esk8ers are classed as 'pedestrians' (on wheeled recreational devices), not riders (like cyclists)

![35 AM|592x175](upload://o4g9SB47HoOT61YSWxxcJNPbleV.png)

- esk8ers (carrying their boards)_can_ be travelling on roads by foot, but when there are foot paths, and bike paths they can't be on the road; and they must travel single file.

![53 AM|586x356](upload://akwMVOx6OBwEee4l0F5XzdrlOh0.png)

- esk8s are not mentioned to be allowed on bike paths...
- BUT if an esk8er is on his esk8 (a wheeled recreational device), then he's allowed on a bike path!

I once saw a walking pedestrian _fined _ whilst walking along the Harbour Bridge bike path...

![41 AM|589x432](upload://nwNktVsWHPJG6U3P2cVZpgbZvcl.png)

- esk8ers on esk8s cannot legally ride on the road... not _unless_ the road has no marked lines... and the road is less than 50kph (i.e. quiet suburban streets), meaning that you _can_ ride on the road, but only on typically very quiet roads.

![23 AM|599x280](upload://1IdbYM0yGHpACcxwIY03DV0m5r2.png)

- esk8ers cannot ride an esk8 on the road at night... i.e. The earlier RMS rule, "skateboards and rollerblades can only be used on the road during daylight hours". "

![50 AM|569x500](upload://7Q0vmF6dphGo7RbLWCnEebVLvMb.png)

- When an esk8er is riding an esk8 on the road (during day time), he must keep to the far left and ride double file (and no more). Basically the opposite of New York esk8 meets!

That’s incorrect and untrue. See legal facts below. I explain along the way.
[/quote]

I haven't seen any evidence that it's not true, actually. All you did is show the "wheeled recreational devices" laws, which I'm already extremely familiar with due to also being an avid rollerblader. Just because those laws say that a skateboard is a "wheeled recreational device" _**does not**_ mean that there won't be another law classifying it as an unregistered motor vehicle, which _is_ illegal to use in public places. That may be contradictory but guess which one they're going to use in court.

No, don't ignore me. The key word was "should". Based on a now large number of reports from riders in Australia, most cops won't care as long as you're not being an idiot. The goal is to avoid having cops want to stop you skating. If a cop decides you shouldn't be esk8ing, you're no longer "fine" and it's now time to enter law territory.

It's not untrue at all. It _absolutely is_ supposed to be an accurate representation of the law. It _absolutely is_ the RMS' job to up to date information on the current laws. I never claimed they did their job well, or that you should rely on the RMS website's information completely.

You then quote a heap of the "wheeled recreational devices" laws. I definitely ride as though those laws apply to me (exactly as I do when on rollerblades) because they're the closest laws I know of to suiting my situation, and I would use them as my main defence in case someone questioned me, but I don't believe they actually apply to me.

1. The statement "Esk8 is illegal in public places in Australia" is broad and could mean anything, however, in the context of 'thoughts and experiences' for this post and purpose of this forum (to educate amongst other things), I've assumed you meant, "**_Riding_** an esk8 in public places is illegal in Australia" (not 'registering an esk8 as a motor vehicle'). 

To have an absolute answer, like "An esk8 is absolutely _illegal_ in all cases in Aus" is untrue, as explained, as referenced. Read my post properly and you'll see. Likewise, the converse "An esk8 is absolutely _legal_ in all cases in Aus" is equally untrue and impossible, because new cases come up all the time, and people do strange things. 

You're paranoid and little misinformed. It's good to err on safe side, within the law, but you don't seem to understand what the law is for, and it sounds like you might be wanting to push the boundaries.

OK, clearly, skateboards _are_ legal (as toys, recreational devices, etc), but the _electric_ part is now the issue for esk8ers, relating to speed, dangerous batteries, and possible injury to yourself and others (this is the main focus of the law). This is the part that is a concern to others and the legal system. It's also a concern for your wellbeing as well as your neighbour. E.g. If you're running a chain drive without a chain guard (which mandatory for  registered motorcycles) and you wear loose clothing, like jeans with ripped seams, it could easily get sucked into the sprocket and rip your pants, and possibly pull your leg in, pull your shoes in, and fracture or break your foot / ankle / leg. 

To explain, I'll focus on legislation vs case law. (The governor general hardly does anything.)

**Legislation:** Know that Australia is a not a police state, not an authoritarian dictatorship, or under martial law (although it may feel like a 'nanny state' at times). We're under a _parliamentary_ system (where MPs have the power to pass new law / legislation / acts if they see reason to), that is, a _**parliamentary democracy**_ (not communism, not a dictatorship, etc). When new issues arise, e.g. politicians feel that Sydney needs bike paths everywhere, because people are fat, stressed, unfit, and petrol is too expensive, etc, then they'll pass motions to discuss these matters in parliament. These motions are eventually passed into _acts of parliament_ which are "laws". So, yes, it's not absolutely guaranteed that esk8s won't be ruled out and made illegal, categorically, and finally. But this is highly highly unlikely. Also, when you go to court, it's usually for _one reason__ e.g. 'Riding a skateboard on a main road with marked lines', or 'Riding a skateboard going 50kph on a bike path with a 20kph speed limit'. You're not there to debate various laws for a  plethora of possible breaches. This is where you're paranoid and a bit silly.

[quote="Clonkex, post:45, topic:46448"]
... (it) does not mean that there won’t be **another law**...
[/quote]

Even if there are complaints / concerns about esk8s, you need to be faithful in the parliamentary process, that MPs are somewhat intelligent, with a conscience, and qualified with the ability to make decisions for your benefit and good. 

E.g. Our new luxuriously wide and smooth bike paths and cyclist privileges, with equal rights as drivers, are mostly due to system in The Netherlands where cyclists out rank drivers and the whole city rides bikes. Likewise, much of the new infrastructure in Sydney and Australia-wide is directly copied from Hong Kong, Tokyo, Singapore, Taiwan, Shanghai, Beijing, London, Berlin, etc, and it's usually really really good stuff. Without it, Australia would still be really backward, remote, and bumpkin place, living in dust and the sticks.

Dutch point-of-view of Sydney bike paths: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibNNdMgHmHs. 

Bourke Street is a good example (see 3:13). But out in the suburbs, particularly in the new development areas in North West, paths are even twice as wide, perfect for carving. Notice the Bondi Beach part about no helmets and police don't care (see 1:01), so things like the helmet law varies with the policeman on duty, as does the bell rule, and even the signage rules. 

E.g. I took a friend visiting Sydney for a cycling tour in the city, and we asked the police a few questions about where we could or could not ride, and they honesty replied "I have no idea" and had to go check the signs themselves. But they didn't seem to care too either way. It was a beautiful day and we're sensible adults not hurting or being a nuisance to anyone. 

**Map of cycle paths in Sydney:**

http://theprotocity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/cycle_map.png
(http://theprotocity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/cycle_map.png)

So esk8s have been allowed to follow some bike rules, like cyclists (but not as 'cyclists' per se) whilst they are classed as 'pedestrians' on WRDs otherwise. (They are definitely not 'registered motor vehicles', so let's be clear about that.) Neither of which is "illegal". So, yes, **"Esk8s are legal in public places in Aus."** as long as you abide by the rules where you are riding.

**A summary for those confused:** Esk8s _are_ legal and they _can_ be legally riden on _certain roads_ but at _certain speeds_ and at _certain light conditions_ (in daylight). However, when there is footpath / bikepath, then it's only legally allowed on the footpath or bikepath, making the road _illegal_. That is unless there's a reason for you to use the road, like an obstacle / council works on the footpath / bikepath and you must detour via. the road... but that would be a rare exception to the rule.

**Judges and case law:** This is usually the main focus. That's why I've shared a bit about my case and what I've seen at court. While each court and judge is slightly different, of course, they're also somewhat the same, a bit like Mr. Anderson from the Matrix (i.e. they're under the same bar, same high court, same law society for solicitors, etc). Also, they all are (supposed to be somewhat) up to date on _case law_  and what serious cases have happened across the state / country / world__E.g. Rider _X_ got caught doing _XYZ_ in Sydney and was penalised _X amount._ and the court is concerned that in future _XYZ_ will happen. Thus, as a group, we can learn from that case, and not do what he did in the way he did it. These case are all recorded. Some of it is public info, that you can look up yourself. But these cases, determine what a judge will do.

On that note, it's worth pointing out that Judges have metrics to meet too. They have to consider that gov't bills must be paid, to cover court costs, to pay all the people working that day, all the lawyers involved, the judges wage, and the gov't coffers, etc. So when they see esk8ers and esk8s, I don't think they see it as a way to may money. In comparison to cars, with import fees, trade agreements, engineering and design rules, engineering certificates, compliance plates, etc, etc, that come way before 'registering' the vehicle. Basically, there's big money in cars, and easkers are like peasants, not even on the Richter scale! Esk8s are essentially "toys" but because they're now faster and can reach commuting distances, you may _feel_ they're more significant, but I don't think they are, not yet.

[**Attention moderators:** Someone should start an 'Esk8 Case Law' topic, perhaps an rss feed, to record this as news for everyone's benefit. So instead of saying, I heard so and so got so and so, it can be recorded properly for everyone's benefit.

E.g. 
Case name: Damyon Wiese hospitalised
Date: 31 Dec 2017
Location: Perth, WA
Facts: Fell off while riding. Hospitalised with brain injury.

OK, now, both of these pillars of the law fall under the _**Australian Constitution**_. That is, the structure of this country, the states, federation, parliament, house of representatives, etc.

See this overview of the Australian legal system:

![51 PM|690x466](upload://taGojg7ENMR1sNLBmZEafSfXtPA.png)
(http://libguides.anu.edu.au/c.php?g=634887&p=4547083)

In 99% of cases, esk8ers will go to local court (in yellow) and progress upwards from there as it gets more serious. 

(It won't fall under a Commonwealth Court, unless you don't hurt someone up with an esk8, perhaps using an esk8 to injure someone like a family member or colleague deliberately, etc.)

(https://andrewharvey4.wordpress.com/2009/09/19/genl2021-introduction-to-the-australian-legal-system-my-lecture-notes/)

2. Registration of vehicles is not the topic. However, I have also answered that because if you read carefully you will see that a wheeled recreational devices (WRD) is defined in the **The Road Rules 2014 under the Road Transport Act 2013**, which is under the "Government Departments" section above. 

An esk8 is _not_ a registerable vehicle. Currently, it does not meet the minimum weight, speed / power, or Australian Design Rule Standards. But, as quoted, the moment you brake the speed the limit, you will be at risk of being penalised by a policeman.

But as mentioned, it's rare and unlikely that you will take the RMS to court and challenge them. Usually people are contesting fines, or warnings, or prohibitions to drive, or similar penalties given by the policeman on duty / police prosecutor at court / allowed by the judge at court.

There is no other relevant Australian law to my knowledge. Did you have something in mind?

In summary, respect the law, and keep it, but also don't abuse the freedom you've been given by acting selfishly and negatively affecting others. That's when the law typically takes effect and reprimands you. Do unto others as you would have done unto you. That is, the 2nd part of the royal law: "**Thou shalt love thy neighbour _as thyself_.**" (Matthew 22:39, King James Version)

It's illegal in Victoria, but so is riding an unregistered dirt bike down the street and hooning round the local park like my neighbours do 😂

Everything still falls under the [Road Safety Act 1986](http://www.legislation.vic.gov.au/Domino/Web_Notes/LDMS/LTObject_Store/LTObjSt3.nsf/DDE300B846EED9C7CA257616000A3571/4FBD7416245B23A4CA257761002C2446/$FILE/86-127a113.pdf). It's definition of a motor vehicle is as follows (pg 23).

> **motor vehicle** means a vehicle that is used or intended to be used on a highway and that is built to be propelled by a motor that forms part of the vehicle but does not include—
 (a) a vehicle intended to be used on a railway or tramway; or
 (b) a motorised wheel-chair capable of a speed of not more than 10 kilometres per hour which is used solely for the conveyance of an injured or disabled person; or
 ( c) a vehicle that is not a motor vehicle by virtue of a declaration under subsection (2)(b); 

Highway definition (pg 18)

> **highway** means road or road related area;

Road related area can be found on pg 34, I won't copy/paste, but it covers pretty much everything (footpaths, bike paths, car parks, nature strips, etc, etc).

There's some exemption I can't find for electric bicycles. In short _you put a motor on something and it probably meets the definition of a motor vehicle_ and you fall under this act. Skateboard is a 'wheeled recreational device', skateboard with a motor attached is a 'motor vehicle'.

[quote="solideogloria, post:46, topic:46448"]
An esk8 is not a registerable vehicle.
[/quote]

If I put wheels and a motor on my couch, and can satisfy ADRs/roadworthy I'd be allowed to register it. Same goes for an esk8. The problem is it'd be pretty much impossible, so you're therefore using an unregistered and unroadworthy vehicle (hefty fines).

Esk8s need an exemption in this act, till then they're illegal (to use on road or road related area).

Thank you, @lock. I was going to spend ages replying but you've just summed up everything I was going to say.

@solideogloria Most of what you're saying is irrelevant. Your entire argument relies on electric skateboard being classified as wheeled recreational devices, yet it's significantly more likely that they would be classified as unregistered motor vehicles. If they fall into the latter group, riding them in any public place is illegal and potentially carries hefty fines. You also seem to think I don't understand how our parliamentary government works but at no point have I indicated that. 

I'm not debating whether it's possible or likely for the police or the judge to be lenient or very strict, or whether they will know about or care about the laws. That's entirely down to the particular person you are forced to deal with and is not something we can predict. I'm not sure why you keep bringing this up.

Both statements are misinformation, and highly speculative guesswork.

@Clonkex You don't understand. It's not "entirely down to a particular person", or policeman, as you aforementioned. That's untrue. As you claim to know, then you would have known that a court is _a group_ of people, and parliament, is another _group(/s) of people_ . Neither are "a particular person". 

You've asked about legality, but you seem to have no interest in the law itself. "leniency or strictness" is not what the law is exists for. It's not a slapstick. What you have written is an extremely self-centred and childish point of view. You sound like a child talking about the "leniency or strictness" of a disciplinarian school teacher. As said above, the legal system is for your benefit, and the benefit of others. You, _and_ your neighbour.

[quote="Clonkex, post:48, topic:46448"]
... or whether they will know about or care about the laws.
[/quote]

No. That's an unfair low blow. Law enforcement, courts, and politicians DO CARE. Even if they are extremely inept / corrupt, they have sworn oaths and are under the scrutiny of their peers to perform according to their job description, _legally._ Things like the ICAC, Royal Commissions, etc, exist to investigate rotten apples. But for you to imply that Australian law enforcement 'do not know or care about the law' is a cheap shot, and an un-Australian thing to write.

Yes, the judge has the final say, but he cannot make things up as you're implying. That would be carte blanch. A totally corrupt lawless society. If you understood the law, you would know understand the role of _case law_ , i.e. past cases are considered by courts when passing a verdict; as do metrics. However, currently, I don't believe there are many esk8 cases (as opposed to cyclist cases) on record.

Your reasoning is flawed. Having a motor doesn't mean anything. Plenty of things in this world have motors: Fans, drones, toy boats, computers, printers... 

If you had blue slipped and had registered a vehicle before, or bothered to read for yourself before posting your trollish nonsense, you would know that, _an ADR checklist must be fully satisfied_ in order to register a vehicle. that includes meeting basic safety requirements like having the right ADR seat belts, ADR indicators, an ADR horn, and ADR head light, an ADR brake light, wheel guards, airbags, windows, a roof, etc. Does your esk8 have any of those??? Do your rollerblades??? If not, then your vehicle is a WRD, just a skateboard. 

And even if you had those items on your hypothetical "couch" @lock, it must fall into an approved 'vehicle category'. Perhaps you could elaborate, _what category_ would that be what exactly?

Open your eyes and look at the 'Applicability Table' section and the listed 'Vehicle Categories' in the Vehicle Standard (Australian Design Rule 42/04 – General Safety Requirements) 2005.

Ok. This is going to be difficult since you seem to either take what I say too literally or not literally enough. I'll try.

You said this:

[quote="solideogloria, post:42, topic:46448"]
Know that courts are basically a group of people making decisions on behalf of the government / monarch (who don’t have time hear everyone’s case personally). There’s a judge, police prosecutor, the court officer, the typist, and your lawyer all in one room. They’re all colleagues in that sense and they chat amongst themselves (sometimes sociably, sometimes aggressively), discussing possible solutions, and eventually arrive at a suitable decision / verdict / penalty / recommendation. They discuss the facts of your case, the law, and your circumstances. The police prosecutor presents an antagonising case against you, telling the judge how naughty you have been, while your lawyer basically grovels and presents a case to defend your actions, explaining your circumstances, what happened from your point-of-view and presents evidences you may have collated. However, they mainly make a very general summarised assessment of your ‘character’, with extreme prejudice. A good lawyer will communicate this better than a lazy one.

E.g. The magistrate at the first court was polite, courteous, understanding, and sympathetic, letting me off the hook without penalty. At the second court he was condescending, hot headed, hostile, snide, cynical, very smug, and penalised me harshly, even sending me a second penalty in the mail, adding insult to injury. At the third, the magistrate was mature, wise, calm, intelligent, highly empathetic, compassionate, and just, absolutely by the book. He let me off with the minimum penalty and undid the multiple penalties the previous judge tried to pin me with.
[/quote]

What I get from that is that you're saying it's up to the people involved, not the laws directly. They can choose to ignore the laws or enforce them very strictly. That's true. You continued that sentiment in your next post, as far as I could tell (you go off on a lot of tangents). However that was irrelevant to my original reason for posting, so I said this:

[quote="Clonkex, post:48, topic:46448"]
I’m not debating whether it’s possible or likely for the police or the judge to be lenient or very strict, or whether they will know about or care about the laws. That’s entirely down to the particular person you are forced to deal with and is not something we can predict. I’m not sure why you keep bringing this up.
[/quote]

But you took that too literally. The point of the OP was this:

I recently discovered that the RMS website claims that electric skateboards are illegal to ride in public places (including roads and road-related areas). I was surprised to find this out and wanted to know if anyone else knew, and also find out what everyone else's experiences were. Previously I was under the impression that electric skateboards unequivocally fell into the "Wheeled Recreational Devices" category, for which there are sensible, easy-to-follow laws that would allow me to ride outside private property. If I had been pulled over by police, I would have used that as my argument. Then I found out that the RMS website prohibits the use of electric skateboard in public places, which made me worry that I was actually in the wrong. If I was pulled over, would I be unable to say I was in the right? So I made my post.

Then some people replied, and I did some googling and I came to the conclusion that it was likely I would be ok as long as I rode sensibly and didn't make a nuisance of myself. I may still be pulled over, I may still be fined, I may even have my board confiscated, but I can't say one way or another whether police would or even could do that because so far no one has been able to source actual legislation that backs up the RMS website's claims.

[quote="solideogloria, post:49, topic:46448"]
You’ve asked about legality, but you seem to have no interest in the law itself. “leniency or strictness” is not what the law is exists for. It’s not a slapstick. What you have written is an extremely self-centred and childish point of view. You sound like a child talking about the “leniency or strictness” of a disciplinarian school teacher. As said above, the legal system is for your benefit, and the benefit of others. You, and your neighbour.
[/quote]

Excuse me? I'm not the one that started going on about the parliamentary system. I started out _only_ talking about laws, but you went on and on about how police are people too, how some judges are calm and intelligent but some are hot-headed and hostile, how courts tend to side with the police. If the courts can "side" with police, then the law or the evidence is not clear. The problem is, I'm discussing whether it's illegal to ride my esk8 on the road. Either I'm breaking the law or I'm not. That's what my OP was about. However my comment on "leniency or strictness" was because there _is_ varying levels of leniency or strictness depending on who you're dealing with. Some police might pull you over and fine you for riding and unregistered vehicle on a public road. Some might ask you to make a board for them. If you take it to court, some judges might be lenient, some might be harsh and strict. I don't see how that's "childish".

[quote="solideogloria, post:49, topic:46448"]
No. That’s an unfair low blow. Law enforcement, courts, and politicians DO CARE. Even if they are extremely inept / corrupt, they have sworn oaths and are under the scrutiny of their peers to perform according to their job description, legally. Things like the ICAC, Royal Commissions, etc, exist to investigate rotten apples. But for you to imply that Australian law enforcement ‘do not know or care about the law’ is a cheap shot, and an un-Australian thing to write.
[/quote]

Please don't put words in my mouth. That's not what I said nor was it what I was implying. I said I'm not debating whether they care about the laws. That's all I said. F me you really took that one bit and ran with it, didn't you?

[quote="solideogloria, post:49, topic:46448"]
Yes, the judge has the final say, but he cannot make things up as you’re implying.
[/quote]

I'm not implying that.

[quote="solideogloria, post:49, topic:46448"]
That would be carte blanch. A totally corrupt lawless society.

Well duh.

You can't ride a toy boat or a printer, can you? Therefore they are not vehicles.

[quote="solideogloria, post:49, topic:46448"]
If you had blue slipped and had registered a vehicle before, or bothered to read for yourself before posting your trollish nonsense, you would know that, an ADR checklist must be fully satisfied in order to register a vehicle. that includes meeting basic safety requirements like having the right ADR seat belts, ADR indicators, an ADR horn, and ADR head light, an ADR brake light, wheel guards, airbags, windows, a roof, etc. Does your esk8 have any of those??? Do your rollerblades??? If not, then your vehicle is a WRD, just a skateboard.
[/quote]

I'm sorry, but you entirely missed the point. Let me spell this out.

According to the RMS website (and since we have no reference to legislation proving otherwise, we'll assume the website is correct) if a vehicle has a motor is must be registered to use on public roads. Ok. Got that bit? So:

1. A skateboard is a vehicle
2. If you put an electric motor on it, it must be registered

...with me so far?

3. You can't register a skateboard because it doesn't meet any safety regulations required for registering a vehicle

...therefore....

_It's illegal to use it on public roads._

Do you get what I'm saying now? That's my reasoning.

And yes, that was intended to be insulting because you repeatedly imply (or directly state) I have no idea what I'm talking about when you, quite simply, missed the point every time.

[quote="solideogloria, post:49, topic:46448"]

[/quote]

Aha... ahahahaha... this is priceless. And you say _my_ reasoning is flawed? So if I built a fully functioning car, but neglected to put seatbelts in, that makes it a WRD? Cool, I'll do that and avoid all the registration fees. Smh...

Actually if @moderators feel like they want to close this thread, I'd be ok with that. I don't believe it is serving any useful purpose at this point. It's very nearly pointless arguing. You could also allow @solideogloria a chance to reply if you feel it unfair to close right now, I don't mind.

Or you can leave it open, up to you :slight_smile:

You'll note he lost his car license for driving his motorised esky drunk as it's classified a motor vehicle. No mention of being done for unregistered/unroadworthy vehicle, maybe they figured the drink driving was enough to teach him a lesson.

hey guys...
i know things can get heated over points of view or interpretation of laws..  
Couple of points;
- I like this thread  (i might now know more about aus law than my own pertaining to subject).

-it seems as though there is a difference in opinion of what your actually riding. (a motor vehicle or skateboard or electric skateboard or electric motorized skateboard).  if the same rider under the same instance took a defense stance under each of the 4 provided "rides" in "()".  what type of outcome... same or 4 different.  might be the angle of defense you take rather than what it is your actually riding.

-i would suggest moving more toward the "amending of the law".  The fact that "no skateboarding" has its own official sign and roller bladders can pretty much go anywhere and even add xc-ski poles that could easily take someone out while trying to pass in either direction, seems a bit unfair.

-amending could also bring stricter laws, leaving no "grey zone"


-power in numbers (ie petitions)   

for esk8'ing longevity in AUS... keep it fella's

In QLD, I believe yes. Read up on the rules though. Elsewhere has yet to implement any specific laws about esk8, so they simply count as unregistered motor vehicles which makes them illegal. That said most people ride in most states without issue.

Generally if you follow the "don't be a dick" rule you should be alright.
