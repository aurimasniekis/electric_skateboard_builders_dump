holy crap i'm on the lam now! The Evolve Riders Group on facebook just removed a post i made about my evolve mods. Then they chastised me! Oh the humanity! Warranties! Safeties! They used all of the words against me. I was shocked and dismayed. SHOCKED. 

I gotta tell you, I'm feeling the burn. Headed off to the burn ward for some intense burn therapy. Don't know how i'm going to break this to my wife, she'll probably leave me now for a better man still able to post to the group. My son won't be able to look me in the eyes anymore. My penis probably won't let me touch it anymore. 

I'm sure at this point people are gathering and talking about me behind my back, whispering things i would find amusing and sinister. Probably shouldn't show up to the bake sale sunday with all this shame. 

How do you move on from something like this? Should I just set my board on fire and ride off into the sunset of infernal oblivion?

well.. jake already puffed half of them. the other half is fuill of sag. Sag is literally dripping everywhere and i keep having to mop it up. 

So i called Orange County Solid Waste and said "Hey, i have all this lithium i need to properly dispose of. I build electric boards and need to get rid of my old cells safely." they said "Sure bring them by!" So i was like Oh that's a relife because ihave about a dozen evolve packs and... " "OH hold the fuck up there captain jackass" they interrupted. "None of that Evolve bullshit in our landfill. You go bury that trash lithium somewhere else you filthy animal!" so now i have to hang on to them or crush them into pills for stabilizing my mood or something.

ahh just keep in mind that these die hard fanboys end up riding their boards and we are riding way better boards. I see more and more people that are now afraid of feel unsafe to ride an Evolve board. Quality as drastically change and by listening their CEO... he's just a clown making business.

In France, Evolve is having its own local event and does not share any of my weekly, daily ESK8 events and I'm one of the biggest ESK8 (if not the biggest) French community. Mellow, Acton all did it. But for some reasons, these die hard fans prefer to have their own ride as a family.

hahaha  you think Jeff might find me to be a good case for this? I'm pretty sure Evolve has already modified their own warranty policies because of me. They quit selling BMSs a couple months ago and started telling people to stop fucking with their batteries. 

Naturally that's when i started advertising a little harder over the socials. And by advertising a little harder i mean i posted one thing in one place and let it start some shit that seems to have escalated to about 3 evolve mod orders over the past 4 days. I all but declared war on them by taunting them severely over the past couple months. I think i'm up to about two dozen mods now and still have orders coming and several inquiries per day.

To be honest mate, we are riding our boards. Evolve riders are becoming more knowledgeable thanks to our communities and will progressively be able to make more informed decision and get rid of these voltage sag ... by buying quality products. It's not how hard you fail, but how good you get up and move forward.

In that case, it's definitely time to solve the stuck-in-ECO-without-their-BMS problem...
Someone needs to reverse-engineer how to fudge a battery level.

Do they really think we're just going to stop modding the battery if they don't want to take our BMS money?  I mean, seriously, is that what they really believe?

I vote that you make stickers of that ElectRodent and slap one on each modded battery that you sell. And throw 1 or 2 extra stickers in the box, so your "Evole" customers can stick one on their boards and represent at their group rides. Evolve wouldn't ban their own riders for going rogue, would they?

To be honest this isn't a new thing.
Evolve wouldn't sell me a Bms exactly 1 year ago when I made a 15.8ah Maple GT. 
I don't think they've really ever sold them without you buying the whole board. And why would they?
It's not a DIY board part supplier brand. They took the route that suits most consumers of selling a complete board. Most people don't have the smarts to DIY and wouldn't even have thought of building a better board before Jeff got his company pumping and set the threshold.
If they sold parts they certainly would be doing themselves a disservice by allowing people to make a better product more easily.
At least by restricting sales of BMS they have slowed the inevitable. 
By the way my 50km AT Maple GT is kicking arse with no voltage sag. No regrets throwing out that BGT battery. Just glad my bms hasn't failed.

I get the same feeling from boosted board. It's weird to me how some companies want to be a part of the larger eskate scene, talk DIY, respect what others in the community are doing and take part in local activities with other boards/groups. Others want nothing to do with any other board, have their own board specific group rides and delete any post that doesn't relate 100% to their product. I'm all about the community, I don't like any of this "my board is the best" bullshit. All the boards have different inherent qualities and each one is suited for different people and different environments. I'm still fascinated how Evolve has a World Cup every year where they don't invite any other companies. xD loved seeing you riding with moja in Atlanta @longhairedboy he was the same way in Colorado when he visited us, he tried all our boards and had mad respect for everyone else! Boosted board came a week later and they refused to ride any of our boards because they "weren't allowed." :-/ the group ride with them was truly lame in comparison to the Enertion ride with 1/3 the people. The boosted rep didn't even know how many cells were in the new extended range battery or what a VESC was... he literally told me "I just ride them, I don't know how they're built"

Thanks all for the kind words ! I love riding with people, whatever the brand of their board. On an individual standpoint, I just hate these little die hard fanboys and also brands attitude. Brands can direct a lot of things, which includes their rider/fanboy/friends (not these who like the brand for few free hats or free stuff to be part of their "family"). Buying sympathy is just idiot. Controlling people is failing game. Today our societies are open, information flows becoming more and more agile. Putting firewalls, barriers will fail and hit them back. 

To me, the only smart way to do business when you are such a big brand like Evolve, Boosted is to join global ESK8 movements like some of us created. Everyone is happy and customers/upcoming riders can make their own choice, be more knowledgeable. I see a lot of arrogance from Evolve. Few of the riders have asked (one of them being an ambassador but not only a great/skilled rider/person too) to promote ESK8FR events and they didn't answer back. Brands like Mellow, Acton shared the events and join us on a regular basis. I think that's a shame. There is no battle and will never be battles between riders, most of them don't even know what is a battery or voltage sag (although some of them have few teeth missing!). It's just about the brand and the leadership style they are adopting. Arrogance and Isolation has never been a good one.

Here's the youtube video. I'm definitely going to love this sweat!
