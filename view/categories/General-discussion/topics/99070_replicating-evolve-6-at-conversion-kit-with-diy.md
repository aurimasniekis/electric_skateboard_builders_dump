I want this:

https://evolveskateboardsusa.com/collections/wheels/products/all-terrain-conversion-kit-6

But it is perpetually out of stock. I even called Evolve in CA and asked when it will be available and if, by chance, they have any lying around.

I'm tired of waiting; is it possible to replicate this via DIY?

Essentially I need these parts:
* 47T Drive belts x2
* 47T Drive gear x2
* Wheel hub
* 6" tires that fit hub

And I guess the wheel hub and/or drive gear needs to fit the Evolve axles... ?

Thanks for the help!

We should have our 6.3" AT Tires soon. Will be about 30-40 days waiting on the shipment.

62T Drive and 15mm wide belts fits our 218s.

and did i read somewhere @torqueboards that the 6.3" rim was a better option cuz it would fit larger tires? or was I dreaming that??

@accrobrandon It should.. I'll have to double check to see if I can fit it w/ others but the entire goal was to have a 7 or 8" option down the road also w/ the same rims. Pretty sure it does. Was trying to make it more universal too.

What kind of belt length would you be looking at with the mounts as illustrated in the picture?  Something like 405mm or something?

That's going to be a lot more torque-y than the Evolve kit, right?

@ShutterShock Yeah, I think it was 410mm.

@cjbottaro Yeah, I think they use 47T. We also have 18T if you wanted less torque.

@murdomeek - Yeah got the first wheel adapters on their way so should test soon which should be a ton of fun. If all goes well will have the adapters same time as when the tires arrive.
