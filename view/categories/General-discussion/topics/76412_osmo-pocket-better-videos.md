Hmm, I have access to these through a supplier. Don't buy anything yet gents, let me check trade price.

Edit: it's not listed yet, I've asked via email, they usually get back to me at about 9am gmt

Unfortunately the price on a group buy on tech items would be identical to single purchase as they come from a supplier and not direct. Dji have pretty high standards for trade partners and I don't meet them.

They'd probably do a group buy direct in the US though.

Dude that's an amazing little piece of technology. So many applications around the home.

I like to send my wife "sexy" videos while she's out. These include washing the dishes, cleaning the cars, jetwashing the garage door, changing nappies and so on. Gets her worked up.

I could put this bad boy in the top pocket of the checked lumberjack shirts she keeps fucking buying for me even though I said I don't want them but I wear them because I'm kept and film flawless dish washing action that almost guarantees me a willy touch in that seven minute window between the kids going to bed and being too tired to breathe.

Excellent!

Just get the new GoPro hero 7 black, such good electronic stabilization you don't really need the gimbal

I have the Gopro7 it's amazing but gimbals are always better, the FPV mode is crazy and videos will come up pretty nice. 

The size factor of this gimbal is appealing, but at USD 400 I'm not too sure.

I was thinking about this one and the Insta360 one X where you can do shit like this :scream:

I dont understand why people like those 360 cams.....They just make everything looks so unnaturally wrong. Wide angle or superview on my Gopro 7 black is stretching the picture, but those 360`s is pushing that distortion to a hole new level. At least now i know that the world IS round :-P
Osmo is doing something really nice, with its linear footage and mechanic gimball :-)

What I like about the 360 came is that you don't need to aim it. Everything is captured. It's a novelty, but putting your phone in a VR glasses gadget you can pretty much look all around without distortion

You guys missing the point about the 360 cameras... it's not the crazy wide angle that's the thing, yes that's a novelty but it's exactly that you never need to aim the camera, just put it in front of your subject and you would have gotten the shot.

This is great when you are skating and prefer to keep your eyes on the road than on the direction your gimbal is facing...

No doubt the Osmo or other cameras can give better image quality, but they all still need to be "aimed" at your subject. There's a place for each type of camera.

Sounds good -particularly if there is a bonus 'willy touch' thrown into the deal for free.........

I got the Rigiet gimball on.Kickstarter last year. It's been in my desk drawer ever since it's (6 months late) arrival. Too much hassle to set up and use. I'll probably go for the Insta One X and it's digital stabilisation as I more convenient solution. Plus quite like the finite dronie effect it gives.
