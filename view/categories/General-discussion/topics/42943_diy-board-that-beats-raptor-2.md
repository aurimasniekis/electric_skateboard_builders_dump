Hey guys! So I been planning to build a beast this spring or getting the raptor 2 but with all these delays on the raptor 2 I decided to build my own. 
The raptor 2 seems to leave everything in the dust...
So I want to build a diy that can beat the raptor.2 in performance, but I would need some help on what to buy to make this possible. 
My budget is 1200-1800$. 

Made list myself but dont know if its a good one...
- Dual Motor Mechanical Kit 14t/36
 Motor Mount Size: 63mm Motors 
 Wheel Color: 90mm Black 
- 6355 x2 motors 
- 2x Foc boxes + Bluetooth UART 
- Diyeboard.com remote (3 speed modes)
- 12s5p  samsung 30q Eskating.com with enclosure
- Jet vulcan kick 37.7 


Is it worth going 12S? Then i need to buy another deck and use a enclosure underneat but thats not a biggie.
appricate the help :)

If you are going for crazy performance, Go with 12s! You will have more power "available", and your focbox will run cooler as you will pull less current compared to 10s.

I think your gear system will be your down fall, part of the reason why the raptor has such good acceleration is because of its sensored hubs

190kv will work with 12s also? 
Max erpm will be 59.000.

If its below 60.000 is ok if i understand correctly?

Yea the Max erpm will be 59 976, but in real Word you will never reach this number (unless you Go full throttle down a steep hill) because of efficiency and such.
So it is fully possible, but with a 170kv motor you will have increased torque and you will have more "head room" for the focbox.

As willpark mentioned, Raptor 2 uses hubs. To have similar performance, you should go for Carvon XL drives with dual FOCBOX's and 12s. If you want a total beast which beats the Raptor 2 big time, go with 2 Carvon XL drives, 4 FOCBOX's, 12s and Superfly's : )

Oh and the remote from DIYeboard only works with their ESC!

EDIT: nevermund, 2 drives will cost more than your budget. Try and find 1 XL drive (or maybe wait for the new Hummie hubs).

- XL drive ($499)
- 2 FOCBOX'S ($300)
- mini Remote ($30)
- deck (~$100)
- superfly's ($150)
- 12s3p VTC6 ($400)
- enclosure ($50)
- HM-10 ($20)

Total ~$1550

If only the raptor 2 could get their production up to speed... 

Enertion told me that orders placed today of the raptor 2 would be delivered in May...
Maybe it is like everyone says, its worth the wait. 

Seems like its hard to build a board that is 1500$ and comparable to raptor 2, so maybe i have to rethink and just wait for the R2.

Thanks for all the input guys!

Your definition of  '> raptor 2' may be different than mine. For example my 'Babayaga' runs on 10S and is faster than the Raptor 2 in terms of top speed. However it doesn't have the same level of torque (still climbs all the hills in SF without hesitation).

You want 15T, not 14T. If you want to beat the R2's torque, I suggest a dual 6374 config. Your top speed at 10S should be somewhere around 30mph. You'll need to step up to 12S if you want higher top speed.

No. The FOCBOX has gone far past the  60,000 ERPM limit. You should be getting 190KV-230KV at 12S

There is a lot of different opinions about the max erpm on the focbox. Some people have done 80.000 no problems, while other have blown their drv`s just past 60.000. 
I didn't say it wouldn't work with higher kv than 170-190, but i suggested him to go with 170-190, because not all focboxes can handle more than 60.000 erpm.

Bare in mind that Raptor 2 has really impressive torque, and if you could run it at 12s it would probably match top speed of Carvon's. My advice is ...wait for @Hummie and his new hubs.

I've talked to @JohnnyMeduse about this specific topic. In his testing, the FOCBOX has gone far past 80,000 ERPM threshold  thanks to the direct fets and higher quality components. Most DRV failures have been due to user error, in my experience.

I ride my DIY board every single day for commuting now. I tried with the R2 but my city streets hate anything less than 100mm wheels. I ride my R2 when I want to look cool on the weekends. Don't get me wrong. The Raptor 2 is fucking awesome! I love it! But there are a shitload more options when building your own. I'm actually going for an R2 ride today! Can't wait!

you want a R2 killer, but in what aspects?  acceleration?  hill climbing?  range?

i'd say, at the moment, the R2 is by far the best prebuilt board on the market.  the acceleration on the thing is incredible.

having said that, it's still a preconfigured board.  you may need a board to out perform in certain aspects, while not needing others.

with a diy board, you will still get to tune up whatever aspect you need to.  so, need more torque?  change the gearing.  need more range?  build a larger pack.

 people are attributing torque to the motor when it's really decided by the esc and how many amps are put out.   a bigger motor can put out more torque only when the stator steel of a smaller motor will become magnetically saturated and cant get any more magnetic pull.      a tiny 90kv motor will put out more torque than a giant 100kv motor, per amp, only exception is when so many amps are put in the motor the relationship between amps and magnetic strength in no longer linear and the steel hits its magnetic limit of about 1.7 tesla and the little motor is then more so making heat and not magnetism.

 especially if youre using a pulley system you have access to a gear ratio which makes torque no problem.   you can get to any speed with pulleys and whatever kv as well.  the contestable aspect is the CONTINUOUS power output.  you could do 4000 watts with either setup if you feed the amps but how long can you do it before it gets too hot to continue and youre sinking into greater inefficiency, less range, and ultimately damaging the magnets.

 Last video I saw the raptor was doing 150 motor amps..   I don't know what motor amps it is capable of putting out but if you want huge low speed torque that's where it comes from

i built a 12s dual 6374 board waiting on my Raptor 2 im not sure which board will accelerate  faster but i do know my DIY board can do 40+mph and i used to think the raptor 30mph top speed was too fast lol. 

Ill let you know whats faster once my Raptor 2 magically appears at my home but i cant see the Raptor being faster then my current set up.

I would be satisfied with A topspeed of  30mph. 
It's the acceleration of the raptor 2 that impresses me :) 
If the same acceleration can be achieved with a diy build for the same money I would go for that since the raptor is not available until May...maybe even later. 

But it seems like the best choice is to wait for the raptor 2... Hate waiting but maybe it's worth the wait. 

Thanks for all the input guys, highly appreciate it!

Well it depends on how you want to beat the raptor 2 speed or acceleration. If you want both I would suggests using 12s lipo battaries with at least a 60c rating this will reduce your sag to the point where the raptor 2 cannot compete. Also go with a gear ratio of 2 and a 50amp battery draw.

if you want a crazy performance longboard, i would suggest no to go with belt-driven
i own 12s 192kv one motor board, and i have some issues with belt-pulley system when i "floor" it. because im using almost full potential of motor, belt system struggles to handle that power. yes, it possible that you could find a way to improve belt driven system. but it would still louse power on friction/noise and so on

hub motors would rule them all. just wait for your raptor 2. you would never make your first build  as good as raptor 2

nevertheless, if you still thinking about making it by your own, find motors with  less kv. 192 is too much. with 14/40 gear ratio, 97mm wheels, 47km/h top speed, i have issues with pulleys. 14 not enough for belt to handle power. 
for single motor i would suggest 125kv from hobbyking, but its too big for 2xmotors

once again. hub motors.

I tested this with the diy hubs ran them at 6s at 50amps maxed out speed were burning hot, did the same at 12s matched the speed significantly cooler. The vesc on the other hand was allot hotter. They were 130kv 83mm hubs with a 12s lipo set up 120c average draw on it. On flat of course uphill would be a different case.

U can run a simulation on the grin motor simulator.  Higher voltage does not make the motor run cooler. The comparison of 6s vs 12s full speed isn't a revealing comparison as ud be putting out a lot more power at full speed on 12s. How that would be cooler doesn't make sense.  If anything comparing 12s vs 6s at the top speed of the 6s will be revealing that the 6s is a bit more efficient, in that scenario

I was talking about the 6s max speed so they are both going at the same speed. 12s max speed at 130kv would be 55mph I don't think I can handle that. Hmm I'm not exactly sure how it was cooler but I ran this test 12 times on different days. Did the 6s test then the 12s test matched the speeds 12s was always cooler. I think it might have something to do with the extra electrical torque I was getting with the 12s im 250lb.

At same speed 6s should be bit more efficient than 12s.  The esc will be changing the voltage applied to the motor so in both motors ud be giving an effective voltage of maybe 22v to the motor even if pack is 12s.  The esc will be less efficient doing half duty cycle at 12s though. So for the same amps out of the esc at the same speed the esc would get hotter on 12s. But that's just what I hear n read n never tested. Be great if u did a video test we could see

Lol im talking about using 130kv hubs those are totally unusable at 10s maxx speeds which is why I used 6s as the base speed. Also math is allot easier at 1/2 rather then 5/6.

Usable yes, efficiency is probably not the same compared to a 75kv or 80kv, I would assume u encounter a bit of heat with those hubs, ride lots of flats, or weigh about as much as a feather

Yeah those hubs would roast in the heat and in the hills with a more than moderate sized human. I had a set of 200kv hummies at 10s for a while and the kack of low end torque ended up always getting them hot after a single hill

[/quote] 

@PredatorBoards Yes for general use they are I'm talking about using them at maxx speed I'm assuming your using 18650's I was using a lipo set up which can output a 50amps constant with no sag what so ever in that case I would reach a speed of 50mph and most likely cause the hubs to fail which would lead to the test being invalid and my self being quite injured after. You are most likely going at speeds way under 50mph for that they are fine I was specifically speaking for this test. For reference these hubs are stable at 30mph no problem and uphill at 18mph for a 20%grade drawing 50 amps average any faster up hill will blow the vesc. I went threw 3 vesc's to get these numbers. And yes the results are the same for FOC at 18mph but under 8mph foc is quite a bit better at climbing hill.

Hi Again guys!
So I decided to do a DIYbuild instead of waiting for the raptor.

Just need some help with the final parts.
At the moment I have :
- 1x Vesc 4.12
- Battery 10s4p 30q cells (eskating) 
- Rear pulleys 36T.
- Caliper 2.
- remote
-deck
-enclosure with room for battery + 2x vesc. 

Now for the final parts im thinking of 
2x 6355 190kv Torquemotors
2x Torque mounts
2x Vesc Sensor cables (for smooth start?)
1x canbuss connector
1x Antispark? Is it needed? I have a powerswitch on the battery from eskating already.


Gearing, this is where Im unsure, Im going to use 83mm wheels and I already have dual 36T wheel pulleys.
Im looking for great acceleration ( would like it to beat evolve gt in gt mode if possible).
What gearing should I go for on the motor pulley?
16/36 would this achieve the acceleration im looking for or should I go with 15, 14?
```

Why one sensor cable? get 2
Antispark switch you mean?  If your battery pack already have a switch you don't need one.
Not sure if you are doing a full parts list but some of the stuff thats missing
>Decks
>Remote
>BT module if you want that
>Enclosure (this one can be a pita)

Evolve GT is easy to beat in terms of top speed.
Also if its your first build there are Kits out there with everything already picked out.
Heres one that had been pretty popular 
products/pro2-electric-skateboard-conversion-kit

You don't need to buy the kit but its great as a starting point of reference.
If you have a strict budget def list everything out, odds and ends adds up pretty quickly
Also if theres one thing you don't want to skimp on its probably going to be the VESC, this can come back to haunt you

So i orderd the parts from diyeeletricskateboard.
![order 6355|504x500](upload://iInfBXkwFb15ltaX8q2TaSjnFyo.jpg)

As i said earlier i already have a vesc from a previous build so that why i only orderd one from diye.
And i also have caliper 2 trucks and 36t wheel pulleys with 83mm wheels.

**Second order will be from eskating where i will order the following:**

1x Sensors adapter to JST 2.0mm 6 pins 	(With my previous vesc this cable came with it, this is a sensor cable right?)![sensorcable|375x500](upload://jDaSoBn7A62Ml1UH4wnROTqnd4s.jpg)
1x Bluetooth UART module for electric skateboards (IOs/Android Metr App Ackmaniac)
1x CAN bus Connector for Electric skateboard Speed controllers 	
1x 12 AWG Parallel Adapters
XT60
Application:
I WILL USE IT FOR DUAL VESC SO DUAL FEMALE FOR OUT VESCS AND ONE MALE CONNECTOR FOR BATTERY  (My battery has a Female xt60)

Is there anything thats been missed?
Cant wait to test the performance! 
The fastest board i rode to this day is dual 5055 from diyeboard.com, lets hope i dont get dissapointed :)

That's gonna be fast but let me be clear it's not gona be Raptor 2 fast. You need to at least run 12s to maybe be slightly faster. The Raptor 2 is tuned very well and has bigger motors then 99% of the Diy market has. Just think about it Dual 6355 vs dual 7080 motors with the Same battery there is no contest.

Funny enough I did blow through 2 torqueboard vesc and one focbox running hybrid bldc on the default FW

Now I have running 12s on Ack's firmware on FOC with focboxes without any issue (the motor crapped out before the vesc did)
Also running 10s on Ack's firmware on FOC with TorqueVescs without any issues.

Got no complaints what so ever :slight_smile:

Not a very fun reading regarding the vesc from torqueboards.... I really hope it works out for me. 
Torque boards seems to be a big player here in the diy community and it seems odd too me that they would sell bad quality vesc and get away with it? 

I will use bldc with hybrid mode since the motors have sensors and all. 
Would you say it's better to run the metr firmware? What causes them to blow? I always thought it was the foc or 12s killing those Vesc.

TBH  vesc is brittle. Even VESC 6 are known for puffing magic smoke.  TB is a big player and he moves a lot of vescs.  The more you sell the more issues you are going to get and people usually get chatty when there are issues. 

Here are the lessons I learnt. 
Read the forums. There are small stupid things like how to prevent shorts.  Vesc limits. (The damn thing is so configurable that if u programmed it to cook itself it will ask you how would you like it done)

Use well tested firmwares with wizards.  Ackmanic is a good one

Buy insurance and use a trusted vendor.  People will disagree with me but I had good interaction with @torqueboards and def trust them to have my back when shit breaks. 

Lastly have patience.  Shit will break. Shit will not work.  It takes time to work out.

Also I fried 3 vesc on bldc hybrid. Zero on foc :wink:

I do agree on the support from diyelectricskateboard, they been very responsive!

2x 6355 motors 190KV
10s4p 30Q cells with inbuilt bms. (40A continous and 80A burst according to eskating)


So what do you guys think of the Vesc setup? 
This is the value of each Vesc.

- Motor max 80A
- Motor min regen -50A
- Battery max 40A
- Battery min regen -8A

Min ERPM = -60000
Max ERPM = 60000

Cutoff start 3.4
Cutoff end 3.0   
Bms is inbuilt on the 10s4p 30q.

Startup boost - .06

Max current ramp step (at 1kHz) = .04

Hybrid mode sensorless erpm 2000

Maybe that will change after some riding experience.
Ive always been impressed with the accleration of the Raptor 2 and Evolve Gt when in GT mode so that to big reason for my build.
Im hoping that the acceleration will be good with those 83mm wheels, hopefully that good that i could keep up with the raptor 2 acceleration wise and beat the Evolve gt.

You are running dual right?
I don't know what BMS you are using but some BMS react to too much amp pull by shutting off.
The packs from diyelectricskateboard does that so I capped by battery setting accordingly to their continuous   rating. (BMS was rated for 60 so I had 30 for each vesc)

I don't need the BMS to shut off when I am trying to climb a hill :stuck_out_tongue:

Yes dual 6355 190kv.
According to Alberto at Eskating the bms is 40A continuous and 80A max.
I guess I have to try to see what works. 
But I will try 40A battery max on each vesc first and if it has any problems I might need to go down to 30 or 20A?

It should allow for burst up to 80A so I hope I will be fine. 
All the parts was shipped today so it should arrive next week :slight_smile:

External can measurements do not really mean much, stator measurements and on the other hand and weight to a certain degree mean more.

I would summarize "technically" to mean it measures out to 70mm max diameter. 

If we subtract the wheel diameter from 70mm it doesn't leave much thane?

Now if we take the claimed max thane depth and subtract that we get another answer prob. closer to reality.

External diameter of the rotor is proportional to stator diameter, air gap and magnet thickness. If Anyone of these has an increase in OD the rotor OD scales with it.

When you increase the stator size, assuming the magnet and rotor thickness remains the same, inevitably the motor diameter increases. Also the weight increases. It's all related.

In summary, larger stator diameter (among other things) means more torque. Faster acceleration.

Currently nothing on the market compares to the R2 motors, when something better does come along I'll build a bigger and better propulsion system.

If there was a fixed formula for design, but there isn't. Some motors are more... some are less...

& Every manufacturer uses slight variations in specs. for gaps, material, material thickness...
otherwise every motor would be identical.

When a stator size is claimed though I have found it measures up. There are no variables between the measurement and the size of the stator so it is correct and there is nothing to fudge. It is a bit like fuel efficiency ratings for a car.

Can/bell size tends to be marketing to people who do not understand brushless motors, where as the internal technical measurement of the stator tends to be for people who understand how the motor works and the relationship they have.

Believe it or not. The stator diameter, air gap, magnet thickness and rotor thickness are all related.... It's like a magic ratio for torque output. 

Assuming you simply go with the standards set by most china factories (all of the existing outrunner motors on the market) then you are better off measuring stator diameter as a Benchmark. 

Just remember, these common motors are not designed for maximum torque outout, they are designed for maximum Power to (motor/vehicle) weight ratio. This is great for airbourne vehicles. However completely wrong use case for esk8. 

If you ain't designing your own esk8 motor you are already 2yrs behind...

**110% refund if unsatisfied with Raptor 2 performance is not a marketing strategy, it's a performance promise.**

I'm 120% happy with my Raptor 2 after 500km, still insane power, even only with 30 amps batt max.

That raptor seems to be the best of the best, if they are available for immediate shipment in the summer I probably won't be able to resist the urge...😂👌

on the one hand I agree loopy, on the other hand I don't. You just said every thing is the same, then said it would be different. Even if we take that all the china factories are different, your different and a single other different nobody is different too. Lets now imagine the China factories make things that look similar but have little differences. Now everything is different.

As I said the can/bell measure is extrapolated from the stator using a bunch of variables, so it varies. 
As you agreed, there are differences in motor performance so where does that come from if not the stator measurement and the weight (of copper wound)?

As for raptor performance you are the only one discussing that.

I do believe My Raptor 2 will be fast when ever they decide to ship mine and I'll probably be satisfied with it as a second board but I don't think it will have the power to compete with serious DIY builds especially if it's 12-13s set ups.

Its a marketing hype. You forgot to place the *** with hidden text that says that you have to pay restocking fees which mean that you don't even see 100% back. Lol

Why make such a specific comment when you obviously didn't even read the terms yourself..... 


Let me help you.... Regarding the 110% performance promise It says:

_A service & handling fee up to 20% may be deducted from final refund amount if there are missing parts, damaged parts or damaged packaging._

Pretty reasonable I think...

Did you mean “refund?” I honestly think it’s really subjective if 20% off service and handling counts towards the extra 10% refund
