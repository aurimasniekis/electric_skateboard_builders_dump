I wonder if there are any meetups and cool places to ride, if so I'll fly with my Raptor 2 since I have an extra battery in USA.

i see no reason not to somehow creatively combine those issues into a single super issue that rocks really hard. 

@eboosted I'm in Orlando. Ocoee, actually. I'm working my way through my notifications now, i was offline most of the weekend fucking up a couple more decks and finally getting two cut right, and getting more evolve mods knocked out. I'm about to build the most beautiful deck ever for a guy who like guitar sunburst finishes.

very similar! but a red stain sunburst fading to black matte paint then glossed. IT should look killer though.

It would both feel and sound amazing, mixed in with your usual glass maybe even just around the feet positions

 but hey don't fret it...I'm here all day ü§°

Ok, I'm packing my Raptor 2 without battery in my backpack, the battery will come from Texas via ground, hope I could find forum members in downtown Orlando, otherwise I'll go to shred downtown on my own, I'm taking my DJI Mavic, GoPro and Osmo Mobile with me for a killer esk8 trip video.

So the battery arrived to my GF friend's house but the guy went out if the country and wasn't able to pick it up.

I'm in Fort Lauderdale ATM with a Raptor 2 with no battery.
