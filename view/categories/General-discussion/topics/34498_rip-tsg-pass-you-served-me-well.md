Took a fall due to FOC at 35mph. Lost my helmet but didn't lose my life. Though I'm paying for it with a concussion as well.

Sucks to read that! Hope you're OK and you have visited medical center. It's good to get checked after that kind of nasty fall.

Were you running FOC on F**Kbox or VESC 4.12?

FOC with these motors was always a bit quirky. I got them stable for every situation besides full speed which, when tested, locked up one of my motors to brake and caused the fall. I'll be switching out to bldc for any vesc4's from now on.

Do you mean at high duty cycle? And is that issue easily reproducible? Please give as much details as you can. Also about the behavior of the motors when the accident happened.
And which motors do you use and maybe post your settings.

so earlier in the day, Eric from riptide went full speed and caused one of the motors to stop working and perma brake. This happened before (same motor i think) and i suspect it might've drv faulted. I restarted it and it was fine, but did it again when he tested again. 

Later in the day i went full speed and i think the same thing happened again with caused me to eat it. The difference this time was that the board worked fine after the accident without the unresponsive, perma braking motor.

This seems to only happen at full speed.. I'veer had any of these issues (including over current) on bldc.

As for the earlier over current issue from before i changed the observer gain, it would over current when applying to much throttle at a medium to medium high duty cycle. Never happened again after changing the observer gain

So is this a vesc problem? Are these things just prone to shorting out, or something to that effect? 

Daughter just turned 15 and wants me to setup her emtb so she can ride to school (though we're currently using max6 ESCs which seem to be pretty reliable). Starting to have second thoughts on whether I want her to ride this thing at all.

Doesn't matter how comfortable she is on a board, there's no way one can prepare for instant brakes like this (other than dressing up like a fkn ninja turtle). Even then, a helmet only does so much. That Pass looks hammered. She's already had one concussion from getting thrown off a donkey. The last thing I want is for her to get another. Broken limbs and so forth suck, obviously, but this head injury shit is terrifying!

@Jinra
Apologies if this was covered in your last post. You guys kill me with all these FOCing abbreviations. Feel like I'm reading a different language half the time.

There are some combinations of vescs, Motors, and firmware that work reliably and other combinations that don't. unfortunately it's hard to tell which will work without actually trying it.

Wow I feel lucky. My first fall was at 34+ going down a hill. I didn't have anything but my skate helmet, shorts and a t-shirt. Little road rash everywhere and cut palm. If anyones' board randomly breaks launching you forward, I recommend falling on your hand first and get into a roll. 

WEAR GLOVES PEOPLE. Best way to stop if something happens at speed.

Hope you heal up well. Hate to see someone who helped me with my first board get hurt. Concussions really stink :disappointed_relieved:

I had two TB vescs die in foc using 12s. Until someone can build a reliable 4.12 vesc pushing 12s in foc, I'm sticking with bldc. I loved how quiet and smooth it was but not enough to always be worried about when it's going to die.

one of my Vesc-X/FocBox failed on FOC. I assume it was my setting error that did something, hard to tell if it's hardware issues since only one failed and the other still works in FOC, it's still on its way to @JohnnyMeduse. This is scary as hell since I've been using bldc for well over a year with no issues.
Most likely going to stick with BLDC, don't want to buy more vesc just to fry them or get injured.

Rest up @jinra. This is why we push to protect our melons

## \#56 Posted by: Jinra Posted at: 2017-10-03T21:25:42.333Z Reads: 130

In this case I do believe it's a hardware issue as I was able to get DRV fault to trigger once on the bench, but it runs normally most of the time. I might be toasting my DRV so I'll leave it on bldc for now. 

There is also the case of the perma braking FOC mode, which may or may not be related to the DRV issue.

And lastly, there is one more issue wither other people who use 3.27+ f/w and have perma braking FOC without ever even running the motors.

When your focbox was failing in FOC mode. Did the motor just brake ? Or did the VESC simply just power down, and leave the board Rolling ?

It was working fine after a few initial tests when I was building, then the last run I did had weak brakes so I was rolling to a stop. It turns out only one motor was working. Plugged the FocBox to the computer and got no fault, inspected everything and it seemed fine. I reset the FB in question and ran fault again, it gave the dreaded DRV failure but nothing else, wasn't able to get it up and running again.

Motors are new and nothing was shorted...the other FB works fine and turns both motors so off to the DRV wizard it went.

Not sure what your wheel size and gear ratios are but 35mph seems awfully close to hitting the vesc's know ERPM limit of 60,000. I've gotten it to give me a drv fault on the bench but never had the balls to go that fast on the road.
So glad your ok!
