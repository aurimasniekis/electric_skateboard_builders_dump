I'm not sure if that's what they're called. I torqued mine down to the point where it bent inward because I didn't know any better at the time. I tried bending it back, but it just broke into pieces. Are they really necessary. Maybe @onloop is nice enough to send me a replacement along with my order when he comes back from Hawaii perhaps? Lol

Technically not necessary.

I can send you more.

@onloop If you slipped in an extra one with my order, that'd be awesome.

Mines torqued in. I just left it. Looks firm to me. My screw is all the way into the 36t pulley (wheel pulley) Therefore my belt is almost touching the wheel. I will probably just leave it.
