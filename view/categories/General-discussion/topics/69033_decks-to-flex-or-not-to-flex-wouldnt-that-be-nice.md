Imagine having an way to stiffen the deck for fast riding or more flex for carving.

A device that mounts to the underside of your rails, turning the adjuster to suit each different section of the ride. 
To be able to adjust on the fly so to speak.  Able to fit any style of deck.

If you have a deck you think is to stiff could it be deflexed then fitted with the Flexomaster. 

When you hold a plastic ruler..if its flat it flexes easily..turn it 90 degrees and you can't bend it.
In cars we mount chassis rails to stiffen for racing or enhancing for resto mod builds.
 
I'm no engineer is it feasible... possible?


Does it fall into either To Hard...To Expensive...Why Bother?

Sounds interesting. But IMO why can't you just have a second deck? It sounds like an awesome engineering challenge but easily solve by non engineering related solution.

What if you just bolt on some flat aluminium bar on the underside of a flexible deck?

Second deck or second complete board.
If it was easy to change everything over.


Flat bar would work but it bends easily, non adjustable.

Would be rather difficult to achieve. The reason why the ruler is harder to flex at the 90 point is possibly because of the width being narrower than the length. When u have an object that is lengthy, the easier it flexes.

Hey there @AreaKruzer...just trying to think of a design or concept that is easily or even could be made.

Something that is adjustable....variable

If we could put electrical current through a liquid or element some kind of matter to create rigidity that would be a winner lol


Unfortunately I wouldn't have a clue if it was possible

having a material that switches it's state would probably be a little too expensive.

i think having a board with changeable beams of varied flexibility will be the easier way out.

as far as i know, i have yet to see any boards with variable flex.

if one were to try and make it, probably will have to go through quite a substantial amount of testing. the only material i think that is plausible for making the beams with varied stiffness is probably making polyurethane of varied hardness.

I was thinking of this the other day. My idea was to have a square tube that runs between the length of the two trucks. This tube is self collapsing though, so that it can be full length and provide a completely flex free board or it can be slid down to the ends of the trucks so that it allows the board to flex through the middle portion.

The look would be kinda like the benchwheel enclosure but cut in the middle so that it can slide back and forth.

The tube could also double as an enclosure for the electronics

Afaik torsional flex is one of the big reasons for instability so a deck that only flexes on one axis is what youâ€™re looking for. Unfortunately most flexy decks will twist and turn when flexing but Iâ€™ve read that buddy buddyâ€™s decks uses some weird string tech to try and make it flex in only one axis, up and down without any torsional flex

I remember when I was looking for subframe connectors for my Unibody 66.

Somebody told me it was much stronger to have round or tubular subframe connectors as apposed to square to stop the body twisting under heavy load...acceleration

another neat idea (one i have often pondered because we use electric decks) is to use "muscle wire" (Nitinol) infused into a deck w/ a separate battery pack (or a buck converter) and using either a Pot or some kind of current limiting circuit.

it's a type of metal that bend when current is applied. with enough experimentation we could use that contracting force to stiffen the deck up or allow it to bend, depending on the amount of current allowed to flow through the wire.

When the Muscle WireÂ® is in its martensitic form, it can be formed and bent into different shapes. However, when an electrical current of ~1.5A is applied to the wire, or is heated to ~100C it reverts to austenite form and recovers its previous shape with great force. $1.95

In our search to own the ultimate deck aka @Hummie group buy 3... or the renowned Red Ember Boards ect...cavities running  the length of the deck could be incorporated into making?.
Torsion rods either inserted or not would provide the adjustment capability.

Probably split the deck?

Aesthetically pleasing... functional... more cost for sure but less than having another deck.


But something that could be used for all existing decks...much more saleable...trying to  cover design production costs...the profits obviously going to worthy charities like our Christmas party or something..lol

Well coming back to it, it wouldnâ€™t matter the wheel bas as it is a two piece system. One on each truck, that way it can just extend as much as it needs to until reaching the other piece which it becomes coupled to. 

That would allow various wheel bases.

Before trying all the futuristic solutions, why don't you run with the proven formula.
Put a string (or bunch) under the deck at an offset. 
Pretension.
Go ride.
(need to figure out the details: go around the enclosure, how to pretension, small stuff...)

Works for bridges and guitars, no reason not to work here.

Hi there @danile..my first thoughts..it would be a hell of a lot going on under the deck.

Lots of bits to connect and stay connected. Don't want anything getting loose and caught.

The concept is good I think.

his idea isnt very costly, but if you have a broken wire in midst of a ride, you wouldnt be able to replace the wire unless you have a spare always with you. and wire will definitely either snap or stretch in the long run, i dont suggest going that way also.

if there is multiple wires to tune, you probably need to use a guitar tuner to "tune" your wire's tension for a more uniform tension on each of the wires.

How about another deck basically...split into two halves.

Complete with grip tape and a fastening devices or clips.

It slides on from the sides...overlapping underneath down the rails.
it's not adjustable but it allows you to go a none or little flex deck.

More complex more expense... To Hardâ€¦To Expensiveâ€¦Why Bother when we have...

I like this idea and got one in return : what about a stack of electro magnets in rails?

String 2 or 3 rails (carbon or alu) accross the deck, cut in small pieces as to allow full flex of the deck. Each separate piece brings its own electro magnet. Current OFF, no stiffness and full flex. Current ON, full stiffness and no flex. 

Add a controller able to read VESC motor speed, so it manages current Flux accordingly and you obtain progressive OTG flex / stiffen directly based on your speed without needing to manually adjust. Of course you can program it so it stiffens early or late based on your choice.

How's that?

Edit : one downside is added weight though.

Hey there @Vanarian how much weight are we talking about?

I like your idea.. concept... simply for its creativity an innovation to know how... or WTF lol
There is the cost of the solution as apposed to one like... 
"having a board with changeable beams of varied flexibility" 

To have the ability to vary the flex would ideally be built into a production board.
How I don't know or with what... lol

If you had say a GTX then you would want to mod it for stability at higher speeds.

Well (I'd need prÃ©cise numbers) we're talking about magnets strong enough to fight against lateral force (body weight) minus deck resistance + either a sorta buck converter from main battery or a separate battery with enough punch to power the rails for the whole ride :thinking:

With a dedicated deck and inserts in the wood (kinda like a squeleton) one can use more magnets of smaller size and discard the rails, so you save weight. 

You can also use the rail with small pieces of enclosure so it serves both for stiffening and electronics, it helps somehow. 

But As is I'd say ballpark 2kg more minimum for everything, excluding the extra battery pack.

It can definitely be shaved down but that's kinda a safe estimation I think.

2kg..a significant amount... but if it became necessary I dare say a few of us could do
 with loosing that amount...lol

What about funding? How much would it cost for 2 prototypes...
Just in case one went boom.... so to speak..
Insurance... incase we knock out any essential services on test runs..... EMF's yes...no?

We could donate our boards for the greater good.

Could we run the magnets in say a 1 inch band down the rails underneath the deck?

Run several loops nylon cable lengthwise on the bottom of the deck, taught but under no tension. This is your flex mode. To increase tension and stiffness, tighten the cables in a tourniquet like fashion, stick the rod between the cable loops and twist. 

https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d8/Tourniquet_%28PSF%29.png/1920px-Tourniquet_%28PSF%29.png

Well I have no idea how much is needed (didn't dig too much yet), but after more thought it might be doable at under 1kg + battery and not much expensive :wink: 

either use big magnets and long rails (like 5 segments) = super strong, easy to build and mount but heavier

Or use many small magnets and small rails (like 20-30 segments) = still super strong, more compact and lighter but a pain to assemble!

Edit : I'd do it for the sake of science but lack the time to test it right now.

Here is an article on a newish metamaterial tech.

The University of Michigan team says its new metamaterial specializes in switching its surface between hard and soft states. Applying a small amount of strain allows that stiffness to be changed by several orders of magnitude, without damaging or weakening the material itself. 
"The novel aspect of this metamaterial is that its surface can change between hard and soft," says Xiaoming Mao, lead author of the study. "Usually, it's hard to change the stiffness of a traditional material. It's either hard or soft after the material is made."

http://www.trampaboards.com/11ply-flex-bridge--stiffen-your-deck-by-adding-a-flex-bridge-to-your-deck-p-10364.html
So when installed it would look like this (minus the handle)
![Image result for trampa flex bridge](https://www.trampaboards.com/images/products/thumbs/10148.jpg)
they suggest that you can use an adhesive if you want the absloute best results, but i see no issue in using only the four bolts so secure it to your deck. The addition of it to your deck would stiffen it (by how much would depend on the ply you chose) and the removal of it would return your deck to its previous (flexible) state. 

If not this exact product im sure something like it could be used to achieve the desired results

That's liquid metal, basically water or oil poured with iron powder particles!

With magnetic fields you can give it very interesting shapes. Still you need a super strong field to obtain a resistive shape able to stiffen a deck (it is still "liquid to touch" IIRC)

Anyone tried the rope actuator with 3d printed arms for science? I still find it lightweight and can be pretty flat shape and solid :beers:

Maybe with an X shape across the deck of braid cable?
