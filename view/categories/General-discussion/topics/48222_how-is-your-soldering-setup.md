Hi guys! 

Just wanted to share my soldering setup with you. It is nothing fancy, but it gets the job done. The one thing I like about it, is that it is mobile. Everything is glued to a peace of MDF which makes it possible to put the whole setup on a shelf and free up the work bench in 5 seconds!
   If you are like me, and tend to leave a big mess on your work surface - and thereafter forgetting to clean it up afterwards. Therefore I was imagining that this setup might make the cleaning process a bit less of a struggle... I guess I will have to see if I succeeded...

I was thinking that it would be nice to see each others setup to get some inspiration. I imagine that some of you have some tricks up your sleeve you could be sharing?
Any ways, I have now shown me mine - now I would like you to show me yours!

That‚Äôs a great setup. Better then my cheap soldering iron and asking my brother to be the helping hands.

Good soldering equipment is a must in this hobby.

I use this for the heavy stuff:![52 PM|690x482](upload://znfMlvAwkbN1k7Lr2AUdIGVmbo5.jpg)



And this for the small stuff: I've had this one for many years. It's an oldie but a goodie.![11 PM|376x500](upload://5wgrmCiniZP7Bmzo90GIH6zcIs1.png)

So I still haven't figured out why I ruin solder tips.  Granted usually the cheap ones. But even this Weller tip I have right now shows signs of wear even after cleaning.

That is some nice equipment you've got! 200/300a seems a bit overkill no? 
I am using a 100w iron for my XT90 connectors and big gauge wires, and it seems to be too powerful at times... 
You must be in and out in a milisecond? :D

Hmm, what do you mean by ruining? If you have problems with the solder tip not sticking to the solder, you need to clean the tip. Sometimes a sponge is not enough. You also have to grind of old debris with some "solder wire",

I haven't, it's still in the post. I ordered from Amazon US and I live in the UK so it takes 2 weeks to be shipped but I know it's from a genuine dealer. And it's also cheaper since it costs me ¬£98 inc shipping and taxes (prepaid) 

It's meant to be the best iron in its price bracket

@moon @oskarCastrone I've had one of these for about seven months and it is excellent! Definitely powerful enough to handle xt90 and lots more! If you can't afford a Weller rig, this is the way to go.

I looked at reviews, people were saying the Weller brand is going downhill. And the reviews for the hakko is godlike on amazon

Small tip, the most probably already know, when soldering XT90 connectors always put the other connector in the one you're soldering so the heat can be better distributed, and the connectors wont melt in their housing :)

I didn't know that. Everyone at my work uses wellers, older ones granted. In any case they were way too expensive for me and then I found hakko. 
It's a good simple one that should cover pretty much everything you need.

I must've gotten lucky, that's never happened to me. Not saying it couldn't, I just try to keep the tip only on the wire I'm soldering without it touching the connector itself.

It should not take that much heat to solder a wire to the xt90 connector.  If your melting the connector you may have to much heat in the pen. I would try putting a little solder on the top of the pen and then tin the tip of the wire that should eliminate the amount of heat it take to make a good solder joint.

It‚Äôs not that fast but 300w is fairly quick. 
I believe the faster you can solder a joint the better. 
Keeping the heat effected zone as small as possible.

I don‚Äôt use XT connectors. 
I only use 5.5 bullets on my builds.
Less bulk and I like to keep pos and neg wires separated as much as possible

50000 solders if used below 400c.

Always leave solder on the tip when you turn it off as it prevents the iron coating on the tip from oxidizing. Use tip tinner after you clean with a sponge or mesh. Don't use abrasives.

I've had tips last 10+ years...

I bought a cheaper one, it broke, then I still bought a Weller.  Just get a Weller from the beginning and save yourself the money.

A straight up 40w soldering pencil will always burn tips up because they have no temp control and they just keep heating the tip hotter and hotter. 

You need a soldering station that maintains tip temperature and keeps it from overheating.

@squishy654 Beer is often needed! :D To keep us from swearing, and numb the pain from burns!

@ThermalM16 what kind of fume extractors are these? :) 

@Cobber That tool looks interesting, could you please explain how it woorks?

@E1Allen I do that sometimes as well. I am the only one that thinks it is a good idea though :sweat_smile: My garage can also only just barely fit my old FIAT 850 Coupe - I get nervous every time I park it :neutral_face: 

It's good to get some inspiration from all your pictures, thanks!! :D

10 ton hydraulic crimp tool. Creates cold welds through pressure.
more reliable than solder for high current connections, to the point where is Au soldered terminals do not make code.

all comes down to how much current you are handling...

So I have two. I wanted to buy a real fume extractor to minimize the amount of death I breathe in, but I don't have the money for that yet. 

The one on the left is 

https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001RLZGKK/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1


And the one on the right is 

https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007ZLH4Q/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1

Honestly, these things aren't the greatest and they only claim to filter like 80% ish of the chemicals going in the air. I have an air purifier I run for several hours after soldering to try and minimize the amount of chemicals floating around in my apartment. 

Between the two of them, I like the Xytronic one more, but you'd be better off buying 2 or 3 of the cheap aoyue one since using only one doesn't pull any smoke away unless it's on top of what you're soldering.
