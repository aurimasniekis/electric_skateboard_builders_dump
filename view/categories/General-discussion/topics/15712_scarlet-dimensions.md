Hi!

I am in the process of planning my new build and I am thinking about going with the [scarlet](https://www.instagram.com/p/BN3DJw9gKT7/?taken-by=longhairedboy) or [witchblade](https://www.instagram.com/p/BOnD3vcAmYB/) board from @longhairedboy. I can't seem to find any measurements on these boards for planning a battery pack, etc. Does someone know anything about the dimensions?
