You only have the basic electronics here. You will probably not be able to make a build with a Focbox for 420$. You will also need a deck, trucks, wheels, motor mount. These parts alone are atleast 130$.

If your planning on doing a 10s system, then 245kv is too high. What you need for 10s is 200kv or less.

The C rating on those batteries is low and you will experience voltage sag and batteries getting warm and swelling.
I would recommend you get higher C rating. I use 60C Lipos and they work very well.

Be careful being that particular remote on eBay. It might be the first generation nano remote which where terrible for loosing connection with the receiver.

As far as a Vesc goes. The Focbox by Enertion is probably the best deal going right now.
Enertion is in Aus.

I tried it to see if it could be done. This is what I come up with. You even have $40 to spare for your VESC. I added 2 batteries so you could put them in parallel. and get more range. If you remove one of them you would be in your budget. Also I think you could do more optimization here. The trucks and motor mounts are a bit expensive, maybe you can find cheaper versions somewhere else.

This Is only a couple of the parts he will need. Wheels for example? They can be expensive AS hell if He wants something good. Also the FOCbox? You could probably Get it pretty cheap from the cyber sale, but it is atleast 100$. And He will need a remote, 30$, and an enclosure... As said earlier, you wont be able to do a build with a Focbox for 420$

Yes, i did not include the price of focbox. I don't think it can be done with focbox in the price. Assuming he goes for 97mm clones wheels from ebay for $30. He now has a pretty good build at less than $400. Excluding focbox. With focbox he'll be able to do this for less than $500. Still pretty good price if you ask me.

I have no idea if shipping to Australia is expensive or not, as i live on the other side of the world. :sweat_smile: But maybe some of the other guys on the forum knows. 
Good luck!
