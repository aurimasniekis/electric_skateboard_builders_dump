Today my 9 month old son took my longboard and I was like what what what...? He really learned longboarding before walking😁

He filled our souls with positive emotions. Just wanted to share with this with you too..

All these e-longboarding videos I see of these riders in bare feet! Makes me cringe... :confounded:
