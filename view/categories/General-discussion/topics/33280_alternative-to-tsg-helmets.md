Hello, atm I'm using a regular skateboard but would like an alternative fullface helmet like TSG.
Reason I'd like something else than TSG is the pricetag. Motorcycle helmets are way to heavy.

So do you have any recommendations for me? 

PS .
I live in Sweden, so prefer something from EU.
DS.
Thanks!

not sure if its available in the eu, but in the U.S. one of the most popular budget full face helmets is the bell drop. its a mountain bike helmet and weighs about the same as the tsg I think. Visor kits are available or u can make your own.

Have you looked for tsg on snowbitch? They were heavily discounting some helmets.

Suomy Jumper is a super light downhill helmet
690g

Don't dismiss a MX style helmet with goggles and a visor untill trying one out. 

The peak blocks the evil orb late in the day, allowing you to ride into the sunset.

More ventilation, and goggles don't really fog up like face shields do.

[AOB Full Face](https://aob-boards.de/en-216-Helmet), another EU alternative. [Gravity House](http://gravityhouse.co.uk) sells them for a good price I feel like.

Dont buymotorcylce helmets. Even the lightest one is heavier than regular fullface. Good helmet should weight around 900g. And there are even few lighter options.

I had one of these and the fit for me wasn't great. But for someone with a large head there is more room than the largest of the tsg helmets.

Are you sure that website is legit? 70% off is insane. Also their checkout page isn't https secured.

Take a look if you can find any nice mountainbike like helmets, they're great for longboarding too. Light but strong.

Seems like it might be... Have you ordered from them before?

I found this page that lists it as a scam https://www.complaintsboard.com/complaints/helmetindustrycom-helmet-industry-helmetindustry-south-el-monte-california-c568227.html

No but I was going to.

I've tried on a couple of Suomy helmets over the years, one new MX one at a shop, and a friends road racing one.
They seem very well made and were noticiably lighter than an Arai or Shoei etc.

**Going to edit/delete my above posts.
