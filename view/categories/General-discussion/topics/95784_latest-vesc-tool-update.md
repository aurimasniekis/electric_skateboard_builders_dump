I updated the vesc tool software and i noticed that when i was setting up the motor, i seen images of all different kinds of motors. The outrunner motor icons had this ( ~2000g) next to them. When i clicked on one of them, a pop up said that if i picked the wrong motor that it can damage the motor.
 I'm a little confused, by any chance you know which motor icon i should click, im using (6374 149kv SK3) motors.

How did you get the tool to update? I see that there is a newer version but I can't find the link to DL it...
