Here we have another rider who did not wear a helmet. Please wear your helmets guys! I know us DIYers know the importance of helmets but how do we spread the word to the people with prebuilt boards? We need to find a way to spread the word and remind everyone about helmet safety over and over again. I think Casey Neistat has been making electric longboards popular but he doesn't wear a helmet when he rides. We must find a way to spread the word somehow.

If this keeps on happening the government will regulate us sooner or later!

Also, summer is coming which means there's going to be a lot more eskaters on the streets. If you see someone without a helmet make sure to scold the fuck out of them!

uh oh, is he not from the forum?

anyways I agree. helmet sucks but it is must in summer becausr nobody including you won't slow down in summer.

scold them and do not let them rush the ride,most dangerous thing. people always try to chase other board, beyond their skill. That's stupid.

and do not let them ride yours, especially without helmet on. you can kill someone.

Can't warn enough around this time. people all get excited.

I think that’s exactly what needs to occur. At least from the sense of any road using HAVING to wear a helmet or they get a massive fine and their electric board (or any portable road vehicle) impounded! 

The laws need to change and safety needs to be the key priority.

Well it seems it is needed to force people. A Facebook group I am in is deleting videos of people when they don’t wear a helmet

It's an unfortunate part of life, and people in general.
Many years ago, when UAV's (drones) were not common, there were no issues and those who built and operated them had their ethics. As things got more popular, and more people started to get into them, then of course, the higher the chances were of someone doing the 'wrong' thing and then things get regulated. Usually, the ones regulating, don't have any real knowledge of the activity, so it gets over regulated.
I am pretty sure that most members here have safety as a high priority, particularly when it comes to things like helmets. Heck, I even had my helmet purchased before I even had my motors ordered. 
Its a sad fact that not everyone thinks the same way and they also have the attitude that "it won't happen to me".
It's only a matter of time before things like battery capacity and helmets come into regulation, along with other aspects.

Wow 😮 ok.  We’re all entitled to our own view.  

By my comment I meant that making it mandatory to wear a helmet for road use ‘could’ and likely ‘will’ save lives. It shouldn’t be a choice it should be a given.  Laws will be written with respect to the proliferation of portable electric transportation devices entering the market and I think if this is to be governed safety has to be the key consideration. With regards to restricting the power of these devices that’s bullshit and will not make people safer especially if they cannot keep up with traffic.  

You might be grown up and not a child, but there are those that will follow the poor examples being set in mass media and shitty advertising and it’s those people that such regulation would protect.

Tats where we differ.  I'm not gonna argue this, not gonna get in another philosophical discussion on the merits of peer pressure and if the ends justify the means.  All I'm gonna say is that you have no right to enforce your opinion as law on me and I will fight you every step of the way to make sure you never have the right to enforce your opinion as law on me.  It amazes me that so many people think they know more than everybody else to the point that they wanna pass laws to make them do shit...stupid.

Hey, I'm not here to start an argument with anyone - I love this forum and respect others opinions.  This isn't an opinion I'm trying to force on anyone, simply a view that I hold.  I'm certainly not one to get into heated philosphical or political debates either - I hate that shit, and I'm certainly not here to piss people off.  I suppose that because it's mandatory in Australia on public roads that all cyclists have to wear helmets it seems right that other road users should also observe this law.

In the states it isn't mandatory to wear a helmet.  the majority of states in the US have a partial law that requires you to wear a helmet.  That is all comprised of an age limit, and we have I think 2 or 3 states that have no helmet law. 

I just bought a full helmet, although there has been times on my slower board I didn't wear any helmet.  I am not a hypocrite to tell others to wear anything.  I hope we all take in consideration the risks of what we are doing, and take whatever precautions we should choose to do.  

I highly doubt we will have politicians take notice enough to force a helmet restrictions.  I have seen more cyclist being hit by cars and still we don't have strict helmet laws for them.  They have requirements for teens and maybe 18 and under.  Although, for my state you aren't required as an adult or over the age of 15 to wear a helmet when riding a bike.

All it takes is one instance in the right place at the right time.  Politicians like to appear as though they are doing something, and since we are a minority with zero political influence is is trivial to get a 'public safety bill' passed.  NJ loves regulations.  I can totally see this happening.

They have said that about bikes for YEARS now.  But you are right, it only takes one go getter politician to do so.  I live in the backyard of political non sense, and at the moment I am very skeptical to hear a law that would actually cause concern.  If anything it would be a bike requirement of those under a certain age must wear a helmet.

Freedom is neither better nor worse than regulation, you need both. A completely free society would be awful. Humans are evil.

As for enforced helmet wear, its probably not needed, as you only harm yourself and you're dependents. Its a question of priorities and risk assessment. I wear a helmet for esk8, but not cycling, because I deem esk8 far more risky. However, if i had children or other dependents, id probably wear a helmet cycling too.

Why do we need a law to enforce common sense? Frivolous laws like helmet and seatbelt laws are designed as a revenue source for municipalities. 

If enough people slip and fall while walking, should we enforce everyone to wear a helmet while walking?

Laws that enforce things like helmets and seat belts always stir this type of conversation.
On one hand hand if one does not take these safety measures he only harms himself (and his family and friends).
On the other hand in a society where he has free health care the rest of us will have to pay for his treatment from injuries that could have been avoided had he worn his helmet.
I have yet to decide which is the correct approach.
Example: If someone is stupid enough to risk his health/life just because he does not like to wear a seat belt then it is his problem not mine. But his child seating in the back will likely grow up to do the same if someone does not intervene.

Yes, yes we should. I have no self control and need laws to force me into a diet, gym membership and trainers cost too much and why would I jog or bike when I have esk8s?! :joy: 

If the only law enforcement turns out to be helmets usage, it really wouldn't hurt most of us since majority of us wear them and already see the importance. BUT I think if the law actually comes into play we would have more things to deal with than helmets

It depends on where you live.
There are countries where free health care exists. Granted it is financed by the tax payers but even people with no income (therefore people that do not contribute to it) are entitled to health care.
Laws against overeating are a little extreme, however I am sure it has crossed the mind of the powers that be. Proper education on the dangers of excessive food consumption is something that should be done though.
As I said arguments can be made for both sides.

True. But it's a broken system where the healthy person is supporting the unhealthy person. 

As extreme as it sounds, there are laws against overeating. Like NYC's soda ban that limits the size of sugary drinks you can buy.

There is not a single person in the world that after a severe head injury while not wearing a helmet, wouldn't wish he could go back and simply put one on if it would have saved him from that injury. Not one. Including every badass mofo here who doesn't need no govmint telling him what to do. When you're sitting in a wheel chair and paralyzed for life, I guarantee your attitude will change completely.

Safety laws help:

1) the noobs     --> don't realize how dangerous it can be
2) the ignorant  --> see 1)
3) the young and invincible  --> don't think it can happen to them
4) the badass mofos  --> don't think they need one...until they do
5) the lazy  --> it won't hurt this one time if I don't use it

Everyone has been 1) -> 4) at some point in their lives. And frankly, most people are 5), lazy. Bike helmets, for example, are optional for me. I wear it...most of the time while biking. But I admit there have been short rides to the store where I haven't. That short ride could just as easily hurt me as the long one. But because its not mandatory, out of laziness, sometimes I don't wear it.

Hell, even when mandatory, when I was younger I was stupid (aka invincible). My friend wanted a ride on my motorcycle, but I only had 1 helmet, so I gave him mine. As I was leaving the neighborhood, a cop saw me, blipped his siren, made eye contact and made a circling motion with his finger to signal I needed to turn around and go home since I had no helmet.

I personally don't see the problem regulating in this case. Even those against regulation claim they always wear a helmet. So why not just make it official and save lives. Nobody goes to jail for not wearing a helmet. You get a ticket. In California, its just $25 for the 1st offense.

I feel like the same people are having the same arguments about helmets.  How many people are dying or getting hurt from distracted driving? An overwhelming amount.  But wait I thought it's illegal to drive and text?  Doesn't stop it from happening.  Now you want police running around giving helmet tickets instead of doing real work.  Helmet laws aren't going to fix the problem either.  People are going to wear helmets while ESkating and still die. Although helmets are great and I am 100% for people wearing them, making laws isn't the right answer.  Because of all these accidents I'm for sure looking for a full face MTB style helmet that's light.  Any recommendations?

I don't know if you meant it this way, but that reads like if I believe in personal freedom I don't wear a helmet.  Let me be clear, I WEAR A HELMET EVERYTIME!!!!!!!  Be careful of assumptions.  I just don't want someone making a law about it.  

When someone says there should be a law its never to keep themselves from doing something dumb, its always to help some other guy, ridiculous.  Either wear a helmet because your not a dumbass, or don't because you are.  No law necessary.

The laws reduce incidents, but obviously aren't going to eliminate them completely, any more than laws against murder or theft doesn't stop theft and murder from happening. So should we make murder legal since regulation doesn't stop it from happening?

It should be mandatory to wear a helmet above 20kph, do you guys really know what happens with a 50kph crash without any protection.

> The energy of a crash is related to the square of the velocity, so small increases in speed produce major increases in the risk of injury. The human tolerance to injury of a pedestrian hit by even the best-designed car will be exceeded if the vehicle is travelling at over 30km/h [145]. Studies show that pedestrians have a 90% chance of surviving a car crash at 30km/h or below, but less than a 50% chance of surviving an impact at 45 km/h [120]. Research shows that the probability of a pedestrian being killed rises by a factor of 8 as the impact speed of the car rises from 30km/h to 50km/h [5]. The best-designed vehicle on the road today provides crash protection currently up to 70km/h for car occupants wearing seat belts in frontal impacts and 50 km/h in side impacts [145].
It has been estimated that the Swedish traffic system as a whole probably tolerates speeds of between 30 and 60 km/h, allows use on most roads between 50 and 100km/h (through road speed limits) and possibilities of use (by engine capability) to more than 200 km/h [147] Against this background, in the Swedish Vision Zero strategy, the amount of biomechanical energy to which people can be exposed without sustaining serious injury is now promoted as the basic road and vehicle design parameter. Sweden is re-shaping its road infrastructure and encouraging appropriate vehicle crash protection accordingly. A similar process is also underway in the Netherlands within the Dutch Sustainable Safety policy.

Yes, very light regulation (requiring a helmet) is the same as an outright ban. Anybody who is in favor of some safety laws also really just want to secretly ban the activity altogether. No middle ground, all or nothing.

The simple fact is that by proposing laws you don't get to decide where they stop, starting a campfire that may very well burn down the forest.  This is something you, and everyone else, should think long and hard about.

I understand the need to balance personal freedoms vs the safety of society as a whole. It just seems to me that a helmet is a pretty simple, yet highly effective means to reduce injury, that has very little actual, real world cost to your personal freedom, other than the ideological concept you can choose NOT wear one if you don't want to, but will always wear one anyways.

My apologies. The quote went to E1Allen but the reply went to you, but I was really replying to E1Allen, who _was_ being sarcastic.

You have been respectful, so I apologize. I don't think that once regulation starts, it creates a slippery slope of more regulations. I think it appears that way because at first there is no regulation and then in time, regulations follow. So it appears that the 1st regulation somehow chain-reactions more regulations. I think what really happens is that an activity is under the radar for a while, so no regulations exist. Then as it gets more popular, if dangerous, it inevitably draws regulations.

There is not a single established dangerous sport or hobby that doesn't have a ton of safety laws associated with it. Essential scuba equipment, by law, must be certified, tested. There safety laws/rules for rock climbing, football, hockey, boxing, mma...

When UFC first started, did you know everything was legal? You could punch/kick to the balls, pull hair, kick a guy in the head when he was down, no rounds, just fight without time limit until somebody tapped or was unconscious. The ref was literally just there to stop the fight in case of a tap-out or a knock out. That's it. Then it became popular and people started getting really f-ed up. So they regulated it. 

I'm saying the outrage over a little helmet that you're going to wear anyways is a little melodramatic and its going to get regulated anyways. What I'm really afraid of is wattage limits like they have for e-bikes, because unlike helmets, THAT will actually negatively impact a lot of us.

If we can all agree that wearing a helmet is smart, I don't understand the need for a law.  A law that is not enforced is worse than no law and this is a law that will be used to harass skaters, I bet you money. It won't be wearing a helmet, it'll be wearing the correct helmet and if the sticker is worn you get a ticket anyways.

At any moment anyone could become unhealthy for a miriad of reasons. Thats what insurance is all about, you pay now for what might happen to you in the future, and in that respect a helmet is also a type of insurance. You wear it now because of what might happen in the future.

It's kinda understandable because being banned out of a chatting group is a bit over the top. I you don't want to wear a helmet so be it. We are here to suggest the educate that if and when something happens, it's best to have ALL the protection, but most importantly, take care of the head because there's no turning back. But there's no need to kick someone out of a chat, maybe a group ride, but not keyboard warroring. Hope is that these members stay safe and don't PROMOTE not wearing a helmet and go with the "Do as I say, not as I do" and not get anyone killed. At the end of the day we are responsible for our own safety. Educate, suggest then move on.

I admit, I never wear helmets anymore when I take the manual icarus out. I usually don't ride faster than ~17mph because I spend too much time carving and shit. I do a lot of dangerous shit outside of skating already and I fall more, and dangerously doing side flip jumps than I do skating my icarus. Every fall I've had on my icarus I've been able to run it off or dive roll it. 
But every single damn time I step on the esk8, It's always a tsg pass that goes on my head. No way I would've dive rolled either of my 2 crashes riding it.

People out there will always think helmets are for pussies or whatever. Back when I rode, my friend said I looked retarded in my lame bike helmet. Not gonna lie he was right, and it did get to me a little. Normally I would wear it but during a small test in front of  my house I had the big accident. Thats when I fell and broke my jaw in November last year. I looked like an idiot when I said, "no I didn't have it on". 

Moral of the story, wear it even if u get called a pussy or some shit because not wearing one is stupid.

I don't get the idea that helmets are for pussies or why you wouldn't wear one.

First ill say, why not a helmet law? Like someone said before me, it will save those ignorant people who don't realize at least. If it led to no more laws at least and we could at least save a life, why not. _if it led to no more laws_.

Regardless  I've always worn a helmet. I never understood why shortboarders mostly don't. Maybe it's the pervasive you are a pussy if you do. What, are you not confident in your abilities? Well fuck! As a human being who would rather be alive, I cannot account for all the unknown or unconsidered variables when it comes to riding fast, carving a blind corner, or manuvering a flailing flipping board down a flight of stairs thanks to muscle memory and what might happen out of my sphere of influence/accountability that might happen to go wrong.

Sure. In almost 23 years skating I've hit my head 3 times.

But those three times would have been the end of me. Paralyzed. Dead. Retarded. Whatever. 

Each time though, I got back up and pushed harder. Tried again, went faster, farther.

Call me a pussy, no-helmet wearing bitch. 

Want to fight about it? I'll swing for your head.

p.s. ... I really feel sorry about the guys that have died recently not wearing helmets, especially their families. Truely tagic, can be prevented. wear a helmet guys. like op said.

I probably should just make it known too, from my previous comment about fighting people who don't wear helmets... I don't care if you don't wear a helmet obviously. Maybe you spent too much money on your board, have nothing to live for, just don't care, are lazy, haven't thought about it, or just don't find it comfortable or want to get a good cruise and wind in your hair... that's great! Like that tom petty song :-P

This is an age-old argument. There is no one-solution-to-be-all for this problem, because there is more than one factor that account for the lack of any kind of safety for any sport.

1. Creating a law that requires everyone to wear a helmet means nothing if it isn't enforced. And cops are far more focused on serious crimes or at least ones with more monetary value to the force/city (traffic violations, for example). My city has a law that requires anyone under the age of 18 to wear a helmet while riding a bike, skateboarding, roller-blading, or riding a scooter but no cop enforces it because they have more serious problems to deal with. So plenty of kids riding around on busy city streets with no helmet and nobody stopping them, and if something happens to them, the parents just blame the other person for the situation even if the kid is the one to blame.

2. This leads to another point : responsibility and accountability. This is a problem...The media and too many people will place blame on the electric skateboard instead of the person itself when an incident occurs. An electric skateboard is, in the end, a tool and it IS susceptible to failures beyond it's control just like any other tool. But human judgement shouldn't be dismissed.
Who decided to step onto the skateboard? The person. Who decided to skate beyond their means because they didn't take the time to learn their limits? The person. Who decided to not get a helmet because they believe they won't get hurt, won't lose control of their board, or just don't want to look goofy? The person. Who decided they needn't bother to learn proper bailing techniques because they believed they didn't need it? The person. The list goes on and on.

4. Being informed.
Safety information. This is something that seems to STILL be missing from most if not all skateboard and electric skateboard company websites. Safety equipment reduces bodily damage, but doesn't prevent it (ask any hockey player if their safety equipment prevents bodily harm :slight_smile:). However, most people don't realize what exactly the pads and helmet do to reduce that damage...and I think it'd be a good thing to have that kind of information available easily. Information on what happens to the human body upon impact, etc and allow people to make informed decisions on whether or not to don safety gear. And a pretty good disclaimer that it isn't just about them, but about being a role model for others, especially minors, and to think about what being injured, crippled, dead etc would do to those close to them.
As a community, so far we have been pretty adamant about helmet safety gear. But a lot of it can be laid at the feet of the skateboard companies that seem to dismiss safety as a priority and only have it on their website in an inadequate form just to protect their asses from a lawsuit.

7. And, for me....call me cold-blooded for all I care, but those that don't wear a helmet AT ALL out of sheer arrogance don't deserve any condolences or grievances when someone happens to them while on their electric skateboard. You reap what you sow.
One brief lapse of judgement. Circumstances out of one's control. Those deserve condolences and grievances. Arrogance, heck no. I repeat : you reap what you sow.

It's hard to determine if someone's lack of wearing a helmet leading to their death was because of arrogance or breif lack of judgement though, since you can't ask them why, because they are dead.

So, condolences in almost all cases, unless the guy is a known helmet rejector, is probably warranted... And either way at least for the famz and friends. They didn't make those choices and lives affect more than just those that lived and died.

So, condolences in almost all cases, unless the guy is a known helmet rejector, is probably warranted.

This is what I meant. This community is pretty small but with technology, facebook ,etc it can be obvious if someone is a known helmet rejector.
Anyone else, condolences and grievances.

Took a spill today. Landed on my back with my head making that snap back contact with the cement. I instantly applauded my helmet. I only received a couple of scrapes on my hand, but without my helmet, my fluids would still be on the sidewalk.

From your brief report it sounds like you just took a few moments to collect yourself and then rode home.

That's a hard hit. Glad you're ok!



That was almost exactly the same way I crashed April 20.


The timeframe especially, from peas and carrots to splat so fast.. I've never hit the ground so fast in my life.


No wobbles, no warning, the rear of my board dipped out to the right as I was carving left then a fast trip to the ground.

I broke a hip and shit, I will have plenty of time to work on balancing the wheelchair.

Brian Knudsen-  "I sit back and sarcastically wonder "why do the downhill and longboard skate pages have next to no head injuries and the at the push of a button I can be a skater pages have so many?" 

Please clean your scene up. 

The DH scene religiously fights to be allowed to ride at ridiculous actual skull splitting speeds on public roads. (And have been slowly gaining in our efforts) and we didn't reach those speeds overnight. If you think helmet laws are all that will created by your scooter kid mentality... Please grow the hell up and quit ruining it for everyone else!

I know you think your special and your genre of "skateboards" is different. When it comes down to the odds (what insurance company lobbyists and legislators look at). Unfortunately hospital reports only call it a skateboard injury. Not specifying "skateboard type". There's no E- skate differentiation. Ask any ER nurse about the rise in "skateboard" injuries. There was once a day when the scooter kids were incurring far more injuries... that margin is quickly diminishing. 

Historically speaking, the skate park is much like the native American's reservation. The ignorant to the different needs, of different varieties of skateboards mind set of lawmakers, is such.... "why do you need to skate public roads? We built you a skate park over there." 

Ask yourself this... "Does a skatepark come close to meeting your needs?" "Can i survive as "the new scooter kid on the block?" (Because that's how you'll be treated).

I hope this post pissed you off. Please quit being kooks, wear a lid, and do something about it. Something that positively affects your local crews' appearances. Especially, on public roads and in your local communities. "

Thank you, 
The DH community

This kinda reminds me of the other thread "Why so much hate"

Mostly the "do something about it piece". Here in North Carolina, we don't see alot of hate, because people, business, and communities, have put forth effort, which has turned into local taxation or municipality funds. Those taxes and funds, because of the efforts of communities, has granted us one of the largest greenway systems in the US. Pedestrian, cycling, skateboarding, roller skating, forward thinking safety planning and design of the city, with local events(like beer festivals etc) donating to the city for provisioning access and safety for alternative transportation. 

I said it in the other thread, but I'll say it here too. If you have alot of hate in your city. Do something about it, your crew, and friends all wearing helmets, whether on boards, one wheels, uniscoots etc, will show your city you are serious. Network with people and businesses,and pitch your ideas to the city council or other local governing bodies. If you want to see a change, do something about it. People will start paying attention when they realize thier tax dollars are going towards provisioning safeways for alternative transportation.

Your grandparents(maybe?) fought wars, while fighting this cannot be similar to that of war, it's your duty to fight infringements of your freedoms locally, to extend the freedom to kin after you, just as those freedoms we're extended to you by the forefathers before you. 

Go do something about it. :)

I had a similar wreck, too. Had my helmet and slide gloves on but no elbow or knee pads. Messed up my elbows and knee, but my full face helmet saved me from some stitches and possible dental work. Ended up adding some 187 pro knee pads (like that they strap on over my pants without taking off my shoes) and an armored jacket with built in elbow, shoulder, and back armor. It looks pretty much like a normal jacket.

Ouch

Sadly, the percentage of skateboarder that would wear a helmet on these kind of runs would be like 1%, maybe little kids will. Skate parks are usually better.

Yesterday. I almost ran over a teenager who didn't land his trick and fell into the street. I hate skaters that do tricks next to busy/main streets. Years ago, some kid did the same thing and his board shot off from under him right in front of my car tire....I ran it over....on purpose.

Obviously, our esk8 is a definite helmet activity.

Ditto! Only full body armour for me too after falling on my electric mountainboard just before Xmas! I was wearing a helmet, elbow, knee and ass pads. Spot the bits which weren’t protected!!

![image|281x499](upload://aagWCe81y2qHeoXC3Tz33I2nvb9.jpeg)

My ass pads didn’t do a thing on tarmac either as I fractured my pelvis too 😫

It’s hard too fall ‘well’ when you’re strapped in.  I think the added protection of my body armour would have made me more confident to slide out of it more on my back though rather than trying to minise skin loss by landing on my ass/hip and rolling on to my elbow.

Still need to invest in some Hillbilly ass pads!

Super important, unless you want to run the risk of getting a necrotic wound... Like me.

Got it checked out two hours after the crash at the IR. Got sent home. 3 days later the fun started. Thick arm, surgery and a bigger hole in my arm/dead tissue removed/one week in the hospital, still weeks to go until full recovery. I had elbow protection, but they slid up. Investing in more expensive gear now. 

Super glad I had a full face helmet, otherwise my face would have looked like that of Freddy Krueger.

So I fell on last Tuesdays night ride... I rode my friends DIY penny board at the end of the ride in the parking lot. I went to grab my helmet before getting on and I got a comment why a helmet just for a short ride and I responded I always wear one. It was quite difficult to get going from a stop but once you were going it was quite alot of fun to ride. I hopped off with no issues, others in the group rode the penny board and I really wanted to ride it again. So right before I go for my second ride I actually thought about not wearing my helmet but I wore it anyway. I hop on the penny board and hit the throttle and i start to lose my balance so i let go of the throttle and the thing shoots out from under me. I fell straight back and the back of my helmet slammed on the ground hard like my head was the tip of a whip. I got straight back up and yelled I love helmets! It was the only thing I could think of saying at that moment. People were quite shaken cause that simple fall could had been devastating  with out my helmet on. I actually woke up this morning with some major whip lash my neck and abs are sore but I'm okay and I need a new Helmet.

I don't know much about skate truck dynamics, but it seems like if you're getting speed wobbles at 15mph something isn't setup right? 

In my blissful ignorance I routinely ride 20 and occasionally burst to 25 and have never even had a hint of a speed wobble.

Any experts here care to comment?

Experience, bushings, Rider position, truck angles, experience, deck type, experience.ect...

When I first started even at slower speeds I would wobble some.  Now I carve at those speeds with really soft bushings.  I don't consider myself a pro rider, but compared to two years ago I've learned quite a bit and gained experience which improves your ride.

I have been skating and building my own boards for about 5 years this was my first electric board. I have gone down the the side of a small local bridge and never got speed wobble.
This was my first real fall I have had skating. I have had some minor falls from some cracks in the streets that are to big for the wheels but nothing where I got all scrapped up and whiplash

Try changing your pivot cup to riptide it will get some of the slop out if the truck, and if you start to wobble lean forward and stay loose stay calm and ride it out dont try to counter the wobble it will just make it worse.

Anyone knows if this helmet from Voltaboards is any good: https://www.voltaboards.nl/en/skate-helmet.html (it seems a bit cheap)

Thanks

It seems like a evolve and boosted are dealers but it doesn’t say it is certified so I’m not sure I would get it but a helmet is better then no helmet

Friend just took a hit at 30 due to wobbles. Hard hit cracked the helmet, may have saved his life. 

I'll add to the PSA about helmets.... get yourself some proper bushings.

Wow. Glad he is okay. If you are going 30 you definitely not want to use the stock bushings.

Make sure he gets checked for a concussion.  Damn, he's lucky.

It was a very hard hit. But this just shows how much a helmet makes a difference, his head is totally fine! His skin on the other hand (or both).... not so much.

I took a fall back in June and I had a mild concussion and had no symptoms besides a headache. A week later I was laying in bed and sneezed and felt a pop in my ribs and knew I had a broken rib so it may be a bit for the full extent of the accident to set in.

Stock Caliber 50 Degree Trucks, Safe for 40 mph?

Or 44 degree trucks?

I'd say no. You want bushings suited for your weight for stability. The stock bushings aren't bad but they're 89a hardness which is kinda soft.

Great source for the tsg pass. Satin black shipped to Los Angeles for $300. Got it in two business days.
