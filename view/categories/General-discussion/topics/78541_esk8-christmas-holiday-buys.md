Only thing Esk8 related I know that I am getting is Popoca.  I gifted myself a psychotiller enclosure and a facemask which I'm still waiting on a replacement one those bastards.

My ideas for gifts are too expensive for other people to buy them for me. I just ask for gift cards!

I didn't really ask for anything Esk8 related. I bought myself a Landyachtz mystery box which was great. Im hoping to get some more filament for my 3D printer because I need to design an enclosure to fit this Eagle Switch 35 that I got in my mystery box üòÅ
