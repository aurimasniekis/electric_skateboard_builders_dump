So I offered to help non-EU members benefit from a sale of TSG Pass helmets recently and shipped them out but the last one (mine) got lost. I'm trying to open up a group buy for these helmets as they're expensive and I wanted to acquire them.

I came home today to find this... 
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/1/c/1cea192cf193f24b26f91119b72eec0ed8d8d429.jpg" width="690" height="388">

I've given my address to a fair few people on this forum (sounds dodgy now that I think about it) from buying things from others so I can't go around asking each of them but clearly someone has given me an early Christmas present so I want to thank them and share yet another story about this incredible community.

From this, I was wondering if anyone would be interested in taking part in a global Secret Santa. They do this on Reddit and I was thinking it would be amazing to get a gift sent over. This could be anything from stickers and decals to spice up the tuppaware box under your board to belts, a motor or even a complete should anyone have deep enough and generous enough pockets.

## Important Information

**I've had quite a few people join in so far (33 as of 8th Dec) and to save me time answering FAQs I'll use this space to explain how this works.**

**1. Complete the survey while its still open (till 11th Dec, 20:00 GMT...ish)**

**2. If you'd like to, share your gift and wishlist, they will be taken into consideration when matching you. If you'd rather leave it all as a surprise, feel free to leave the 'special request' box blank.**

**3. After matching has been done in the background, you'll be PM'd with details of your receiver and any preferences they have (no chopped up hookers like in Narcos included, though I worry about the climate you live in @PredatorBoards).** 

**4. Considering the Christmas period for deliveries is pretty much in full swing, posting your gift ASAP is best. Otherwise the deadline for posting your gifts is Sunday 17th, if you can't meet this deadline, let me know and I'll inform your receiver of the delay.**

Have fun! This has been really exciting and I'm keen to see pictures of what people receive in due time.

That's a great idea!  One I've actually been toying with myself.  I was thinking a form where whoever wants to participate signs up and the the participants are randomly assigned?

Shipping costs might mess it up.  Maybe give people an option for local or international?

Just tried the survey and it seemed perfect! I would say to just match people by regions (North America, Europe etc.) I think it‚Äôs a good idea to limit it to people that have a few days read time or are regulars. Maybe do a price minimum and maximum for the gifts? So you can‚Äôt send a single daddy‚Äôs boards shop sticker and hope to receive a focbox lol

Another idea: 
White elephant gift exchange with used ‚Äúback of drawer‚Äù parts, valued in at $5-30 dollars. Open to everyone with over one day read time.

Secret Santa used and new parts valued $60-300 open to only regulars or people with x days read time.

I‚Äôm just thinking run two separate events

Great idea @Youssless. Looks like the karma police found you.

Not to sound like a grinch.. But sending random spare parts to others may not be very beneficial. What good is sending someone a spare 50mm motor, if they run dual 63's? Or sending an enclosure to someone who already has one, and only needs one? 

What if we made a wish list, and if you see that someone wants something you have, you can check their name (anonymously) and gift it to them. Just an idea.

I agree. I have a mount, dual hub motors and remote to potentially give away, but someone might get it and just end up tossing it aside/away. I'm all for giving for need and cause, but would hate to see stuff wasted.

Perhaps I could rejig the form so that people can put a wishlist together then? I'll see if others can submit that question without having to redo their survey.
**Edit: I forgot I added a special request section, perhaps people can use this for items on their wishlist**

@L3chef, as it stands, I'm the only one with access to information shared on the survey I'll only pass on your information to someone with a certain amount of likes received and read time to hopefully weed out the weirdos. If you're not happy/feel its too risky then I'd recommend you not take part as I wouldn't want anything bad to happen to anyone here. There is always some risk with this I suppose and I won't guarantee anything, I just hope to minimise it as best I can.

I'm not sure if I've understood your suggestion. Currently what is happening is that people send their information to myself through the survey and after matching them I'll send their information to one other person involved. So at most, your information should be shared with two people. You'll know I have it (and I'm happy to share my information if people would like it) and I'll know who else has it along with their information so unless a fairly trusted member lies on the form everyone but me is showing their cards.

Considering my involvement (and the fact I've already received a gift), I've been thinking that I shouldn't get involved but I will probably be someone's seceet santa.

Where does your suggestion fit/what does it change? If it gives people peace of mind I'm all for it!

I appreciate that with every opportunity for honest folk to do something good, there exists an opportunity for exploitation. I'm trying to minimise this but I cannot prevent it.

It would be amazing if you could take part, if you're hesitant then I can understand why. 

Let's all hope for great fun and potential for a tradition to start.

A good guide for this process would be the Imgur Secret Santa, check out the FAQ sectin at https://giftagiraffe.com/.  

A couple of useful highlights...

**What happens if I sign up, but I don‚Äôt get a gift?**
This really sucks, but it‚Äôs possible. We hope that everyone who enters is serious about exchanging gifts, but we cannot guarantee that you will receive one. If you don‚Äôt receive a gift, contact MartynMage. We‚Äôll try to get you in the backup gifters program. Please remember that giving a gift can be just as fun as getting one!

**Backup gifters, and getting a backup gift**
Once the deadline to receive gifts has passed, if you have not gotten a gift please email Martynmage at contact@giftagiraffe.com with the subject line "No Gift" and include your username. In order to qualify for a backup gifter you must email within 7 days of the gift deadline passing, for example: domestic Secret Santa entrants must email on or before Jan 6th.

I did this last year on another forum for another hobby I have and it was fun. However I am new to the esk8 so I don‚Äôt have any spare parts yet. Next year I will be in it if this happens again as I‚Äôm looking at doing high performance bearings that have labyrinth seals grease like what is used in zealous bearings and German manufactured. 

I do have a suggestion though if someone puts an enclosure on there wish list maybe put the dimensions of everything you would put in there so if they are sent a enclosure they can use it. Or if you ask for motors or mounts put 50xx or 63xx and what trucks you have. This way every gift can be used by the recipient

That pulley is for the Dankster GTX model i'm working on. It features not only 18K gold pulleys but also platinum stranded belts, iridescent green paint with 18K gold flake, titanium motor housings and an enclosure hand sanded by only the most desirable young women in Spain who coo your name softly the entire time they seductively prepare your components. Other features include a retractable hooka and peizo-cooled beer holder.

I always thought the zorlac decks were the coolest. Didn't have many my way. Most decks were powells  and Santa Cruz. Some visions. And then for those like me who had parents who wouldn't buy things with skulls and monsters,  the veriflex decks. I always wanted me a vision gator. I still think that is a badass deck.

My first board was a Vision Punkskulls. Indie trucks, Vision Shredders. Only reason i got the punkskulls deck was because the shop was out of Gator decks. I wanted that gator so bad. This is the one right here, in yellow, though i don't recall it having that concave.. i was 10 or so at the time.

I don't have that board any longer. However, i do have the very next deck i ever bought. Mom got it for me a couple years later out of a catalog: A Ray Underhill, 1991 Power Peralta

I still have that deck and i want to do a build on it with 70mm wheels. I'll more than likely use some Arcboard wheels since they already have 10mm wheel pulleys bolted in and they're a deliciously smooth durometer for crappy roads, even at that size.

For anyone counting that's 47 of you, 48 Santas if you include meself.

Over the next hour or so, I'll be matching you all up and PMing you all with your receivers. Most people haven't expressed what they'd like to receive so surprise 'em. If you're unable to send something by this Sunday please let me know and I'll let your receiver know what to expect. Excited for people to post their presents!

Oh and excuse the crude address and email format, it should make sense, I couldn't be bothered to sort through and format them nicely as I've got actual work to do before bed.

Let me know if you have any questions!

not sure if range was mentioned, but I would say be reasonable and give something of value either in $ or in use. Nothing tiny like just a receiver or heavily used wheels

Well crap, I forgot that I can't send out 47 PMs lol. Got stopped after 17.

@onloop, @barajabali, @longhairedboy or any leader. Could I have this 19 hour restriction taken off on this one occasion? Just until I send people their recipient details.

Thanks!

I've got a spreadsheet setup with a mailing list. Happy to split the load but will still need two others to complete the PMs.

I'll wait, especially since its 11pm here and I need to be up by 5. 

I may well have to call it a night for now and see what I can do in the morning on my way to work and during breaks.

You guys really went to town lol. My inbox got demolished. 

I've been up but have to go and then settle into work and preparing my classes (I'm a science teacher of all things) and getting stuff out of the way for a breather before my kids come into school. I'm almost finished and will send out the other half in the next hour.

Thanks for your patience :slight_smile:

EDIT: So I done messed up and the files didn't sync from my PC to my Dropbox account. Waiting for my wife to wake up and sync it at home before I can begin PMing out details. Sorry guys :sob:

EDIT 2: So there's issues with syncing the files over and my wife had to go to work. I'm sorry but the other half will have to wait till I get back home from work...

I agree. *I have a mount, dual hub motors and remote to potentially give away,* but someone might get it and just end up tossing it aside/away. I'm all for giving for need and cause, but would hate to see stuff wasted.




*I have a few hubs from Landwheel drives.* Not sure what to do with them at the moment as I‚Äôm waiting for them to send their next revision. I‚Äôll probaby see what they can do with a 10s pack and FocBoxes. Their ESC and battery were iffy which lead to replacements and redesign. The motors were actually ‚Ä¶

Btw, already have a build set up for these landwheels :)

**So we've had our first pullout I'm afraid and I'm trying to close the gap by pulling them out of the equation (effectively their santa is now their recipient's santa).**

**Hopefully this will work out fine, but if it doesn't I have myself and one other backup santa just in case. So the pullout's recipient should still get something in the post.**

**As a precaution, could anyone feeling super generous PM me if they're interested in being a backup santa too (I hope we don't get anymore dropouts but you never know!)**

Hey @scepterr and @stormboard1,  

Thanks for letting me know, does stormboards want to be a backup santa or want to be entered to a second round of SS?

The community really stepped up and I've quite a few backup santas at the ready (hopefully won't be needing them) but the more the merrier.

Most people are connected in a chain (so your secret santa is not your recipient in all but 2 cases) and I can't slip someone in since people have already been shipping gifts.

What I can do is see if there is other interest and start a secondary list/round 2. Stormboards, would you like to be added to that?

put em on wide trucks and carve the hell out of them.  just be ready for blow outs and the tires wear down quicker than you would expect.  tons of fun to ride though.  talk to @treenutter, I think he is still running some.

Thats what ive heard, though Im not sure if its factual though.  I've run 10, 12 & 15in with the same wheels and cant see a difference.  But wide trucks make wheel bite less likely, with 5in wheels that's a consideration.

@PredatorBoards they don‚Äôt. At all. They rely on a lot of small screws to hold the urethane in place, that I have found fall out unless you use maximum loctite which means it‚Äôs hard to replace the urethane. Also, the epoxy holding the magnets inside is applied very conservatively - I‚Äôve had to go in several times and fix them. After a few months of testing and fiddling with these hubs, I got them running smoothly (finally). I‚Äôd say they‚Äôre good - but only if you‚Äôre on a budget and have lots of time for fixing. I made a review thread detailing the problems quite a while ago:

Would it be possible to build an enclosure underneath the built in one? sort of like a double deck enclosure? could drill a hole for battery connections. I'd imagine you could fit a beast of a battery pack then, no?

@Blasto managed to make that deck fit 10s4p with some Tetris moves. The original 10s3p battery used a huge BMS, the LCD and charge port cutouts also added restriction to battery build. @onloop mentioned that "something" will be available to the Raptor 1 owners in terms of batteries since our cells are getting old at this point. I'm hoping for 10s4p 30Q since smaller BMS are out there. I'll definitely pick up two. These decks are awesome even though CF vibrations are a bitch

The problem I see would be structural integrity if you remove the existing enclosure and replace it with another. This deck rides pretty high when I use 97mm with 3/4" of risers to prevent wheelbite. I think @Youssless idea of tacking on a second battery under would be awesome. make three of them, I have two of these decks

@anorak234 and @DEEIF perhaps so, it's a good idea. 

I've been the middle man for conversions and notifying people if their packages are delayed/letting santas know that their recipients are away and will check their gift when they're back home after the holidays. Obviously people can't see these PMs but they have been numerous. No one has messaged me to say they haven't received their gift, its usially been the other way around (santas checking the gifts have arrived safely).

**If you haven't received your gift yet and I haven't relayed you a message about a delay please PM me ASAP.**
```

## \#652 Posted by: Youssless Posted at: 2017-12-27T10:36:14.049Z Reads: 169

@DEEIF, I've messaged your santa again to check up on your gift. I'll let you know as soon as I hear back. 

Delays are always unwanted but a reality, we have a generous cohort of backup Santas who are at the ready and if I don't hear back from anyone's santa after reasonable time for communication and response, then I'll send out a gift (if you're in the EU) or send your info to another backup santa (if you're further away). In the unlikely event a santa is greedy and doesn't send anything out, I can only reprimand them by publicly naming them and making a blacklist for future reference. Obviously this will be resolved on a case-by-case basis. 

The PMs I've been getting over the last two weeks have been quite promising, with Santas concerned about the recipients receiving their gifts rather than recipients complaining and me being unable to relay information. In a situation when there are delays, I believe this one to be more favourable. 

I hope that helps clear things up a bit for everyone. Thank you all for being patient.

Youssless

An improvement I'll definitely be implementing next year is having the Secret Santa event occur earlier, like maybe in the last week of Nov.

I'll reveal that the vast majority of delays (about a dozen or so by my guesstimate from the PMs I send) are due to couriers being busy and/or recipients being away for Christmas.

Let me know your thoughts

I started my life knowing Celsius because I was born in Hong Kong. When we moved to the US it confused me for a while I knew the numbers but forget which is C and which is F. My dad told me ‚ÄúAmerican gets an F because they failed at math‚Äù never forgot after that

Fun fact 1: Hershey‚Äôs is not real chocolate... :chocolate_bar: 

Fun fact 2: Mars Chocolate (M&M‚Äôs, Dove, etc) owns a pet food company. They bid on the same meat for the dog food as Taco Bell does for their tacos :taco: 

Fun fact 3: the two main ingredients of chocolate are f*cking disgusting by them selves. If you get the chance to ever taste chocolate liquor or cocoa butter please do. You will appreciate the fact that some random guy put them together to make chocolate. Cocoa butter is extremely bitter (and I mean extremely) but when combined with chocolate liquor and sugar they make Dove/Lindor chocolate. 

P.S. - I may or may not be extremely biased and have multiple family members who work in the chocolate industry (ahhemm not at Hershey‚Äôs).

i've heard "hershey's isn't real chocolate" a few times before. Is that like a technical thing or is it in the sense of "hershey's is terrible, so i'm not gonna disrespect other chocolate by calling it chocolate."

No it really isint real chocolate. My father has worked for both Hershey‚Äôs and Mars (we live near what used to be chocolate town) and if i remember right he said they don‚Äôt even use cocoa butter in the ‚Äòchocolate‚Äô (worked for them a long time ago). They also add other ingredients to it that shouldn‚Äôt be in something labeled as chocolate.

So got my new board all set up and finished yesterday,sensored motors/foc mode and I knew I would have clearance issues with the new mounts and my 83mm clones so rode slowly,sure enough came to a little bump on the pavement and the mounts scrapped and stopped the board and I carried on!!
So took it home and hung it up back on the wall till I can sort the clearance issue......woke up this morning to find this in the mail from my secret santa!

Really happy thank you secret santa!! 
As a suggestion I mentioned maybe 97mm clones as that's all I really needed but for someone to send me original abec 11 has put a really big smile on my face,being 33 I don't normally get excited about xmas just like to spend time with the fam but when it comes to esk8ing I feel like a teenager again lol you all know the feeling,I'm about to hook these wheels up and go out for a carve,thanks again secret santa made my day/xmas üòÉ

I'll put the badies to good use :sunglasses:

BTW big kudos to @Youssless for organizing everything and giving updates regularly, making sure nobody got forgotten by Santa. You rock !

Hey guys,

I wanted to give this topic one final bump to ensure everyone has received their gifts. Just in case there is something still hanging with some issues please do PM me immediately and I'll do what I can to help (though I think I got everyone sorted now).

Its been a fair bit of to and fro but I think everyone has given and received a little bit of Christmas (even if some did get there's in January).

I'm so grateful for all of you who joined in, thank you for being such an amazing community.

Speak soon, ride safe,

Youssef
