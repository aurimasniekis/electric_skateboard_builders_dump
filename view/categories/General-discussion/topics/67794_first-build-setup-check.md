Okay, so I'm building my first electric skateboard.
 Sorted my parts, just need someone to check that this is safe and nothing will mess up provided parts aren't faulty. My main concern is a 270kv motor with a FOCBOX, would it be possible to configure the FOCBOX to a safe setting where that wont matter? Because im very very keen on the motor I've selected.

Single belt motor kit (MBoards)↓

Personally I would keep the focbox and start looking for another motor and battery

I wouldn't really recommend that kit or the seller for the motors.

I wouldn't recommend diyeboard, for the simple case of low quality parts. And probably the worst display of professionalism I have seen on this forum

And I think your in the UK, add 20% to the final value

Buy some

Original calibers
A good motor mount
Sk3 6374 from @brenternet I think he is selling one for £50
He is also selling orangatangs for £50
The focbox is great

(Ok he might have sold a few things since it has been a couple days)

Pretty much I've watched the owner of the company on YouTube for a while and he's pretty into eboards and he recently set up a company. There arent many reviews on it at all but the motor kit seemed like a pretty good option price and time wise.

Yeah but you wouldn't want your public information inc. credit cards here if something happened (diyeboards have done this before)

Ah probably not a good website to buy front then. I wasn't sure about it as it seems too good to be true, but I've heard widespread use of the website.

Get these wheels if you want.

https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/wts-eu-6355-motors-pulleys-kegels-and-more/66834/4

I've got a motor mount for sale if you need one. It's for caliber trucks

Get some caliber trucks

Try and get a 6374 motor

I'd say that's a healthy budget for a single motor build

I don’t know about the battery. It seems fine. I would get a different motor kit/ parts. You should snipe deals on this forum while gathering information. That’s what I did.
