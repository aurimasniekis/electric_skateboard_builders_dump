For me it looks like a spark between belt and motor mount, maybe static energy? That's weird!

@rich

Just put it back on the bench, spark is definitely coming from the wheel pulley not the belt.

That's what I think as well. Maybe it gets build up because of the idler which causes extra friction in the belt itself?

I can hear it snap with every spark fwiw, and there's a little bit of electrical smell too.

wow.  wish someone could explain the details more.  it looks just like a van de graaff generator and maybe it's the dissimilar material in the pulleys that are the cause.

What is your idler made out of?
Nylon? Rubber belt? I think you might have a little van de graff generator on your board there.

Not doing a lot of off road, but some. Definitely very dry here.

Thanks I'll pick some up.

So what is it about my belt drive that's making it spark like this? Just out of curiosity.

Something....lol. The kapton tape will insulate the mount so it shouldn't spark, but the spark might move somewhere else

bet if you use kapton tape and further isolate things you will end up with a stronger spark somewhere as the voltage will build.    soon you will have a respectable van de graff generator worthy of demonstrations.  
maybe make a connection between points so it releases the energy and it doesn't have time to build

@Hummie

 Not sure how I would connect considering the wheel pulley needs to spin freely, and the mount is stationary.  I see what you're saying though. 

 Seems strange to me that no one else has encountered this with all the different belt drives on here.

Possible nobody noticed, you can't be the only with this setup. I would definitely make sure all your electronics, any wiring extensions are well insulated. Maybe this is what kills vescs on first run.....

## \#24 Posted by: flywithgriff Posted at: 2017-08-23T19:45:27.607Z Reads: 149

I'm pretty positive this is caused by the friction between the rubber belt and plastic tension pulley. I don't see any way of fixing this other than changing the idler material or making a ground wire that attaches to the mounting plate and then rubs along the inside of the wheel pulley. Even so, you will be feeding that static energy into the motor via the mount.

So this is just from static buildup though right, it's not actually drawing any voltage from my batteries? I have a very limited understanding of electronics.

hehe I hope you wrap it in kapton tape and then it builds such a high voltage that it fucking blows up!!!  and hope everything and you are ok but get it on film. 

I think with the static charge it could discharge to many places and it need not be a circuit.   I doubt it would mess up the esc but maybe it could.

You can run a wire that is constantly brushing on the wheel pulley, into your truck, that would ground it to the truck. Just be careful with what may get shocked c:

 assuming it doesn't damage thing, which maybe it would I don't know, but assuming it doesn't it's pretty awesome.  a feature that hasn't reached it's full potential.  If you could further isolate things and get that spark bigger that could be an awesome show shooting sparks.  maybe if you had the pulley further to the ground than the mount you could leave a trail of sparks in the night.  safety feature.

maybe that makes me an asshole because riding around at night shooting sparks to the ground the faster you go sounds damn awesome.  it's so quiet I cant see the neighbors complaining.  if you fully insulate the whole mount and hanger so the closest place for the pulley to discharge is the ground I wonder if it would work.

@Hummie

It's not the sound I would be concerned about, it's the fire hazard. We've had tons of fires all through this area recently. 

It would look pretty cool with sparks flying out the bottom of this thing at night though.  Seen some kids do this with slide gloves.

I don't think the spark would have nearly enough energy to start a fire with anything that wasn't extremely flammable.

@Hummie

Agreed that it would be highly unlikely to cause a fire as is (perhaps impossible idk), but I thought we were talking about modifying it to leave a trail of sparks? Not saying it wouldn't look cool, it just wouldn't be a very smart move in a dry location like this.

Cool vid btw

   I was imagining it in use on a road though instead of through dry tinder in the woods but you have an offroad board.    its not like a flying ember spark which has a lot of heat, the energy in static like this is so little you probably couldn't start a fire in paper or dry grass with even a giant van de graff if you were trying.  I think!

@Hummie

I think you're probably right. I doubt a static spark could light anything on fire without some type of accelerant. I still don't think I'd want to take my chances in dry grass though.  

If you do rig something up like this though, I'd certainly like to see it 😀

This is happened me on one of the new motor.
It fried 2 of my vesc when I tried to bench test FOC with sensors on my desk.
I have contact with the vender where I have purchased motors from.
The only clue they have is tried to change the mounting bolts from M4x10 to M4x8.
the bolts might have been contacted with the motor coils and wirings.

so now I have to wait for a new DRV8302 chips to replace and test them again. I will be on my feet for a few weeks.

What kind of motor mount are you using? Are you sure it's static spark that you're getting? 

Definitely not the mounting bolts in my case. I can see the ends, and they're nowhere near the coils or any of the wires, and I have two identical beltdrives, (or had, only have one now) but both get the same spark. Didn't bother with the kapton tape because it didn't seem to be causing any problems.

Sorry your ESCs got fried though. Lots of vesc related problems on here it seems.
