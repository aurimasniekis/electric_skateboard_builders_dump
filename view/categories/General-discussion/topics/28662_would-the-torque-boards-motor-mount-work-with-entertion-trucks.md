I am currently building my first eboard and was wondering if the enertion trucks would work with the torque boards motor mount from diyelectricskateboards.com 
Any help is greatly appreciated!

I read that the enertion trucks have a slightly longer axle and I thought that may pose a problem with the fitting.
Thanks for the response!

```
worst case scenario you need to put some spacers on the axle
