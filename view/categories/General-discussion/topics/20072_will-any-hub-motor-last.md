If you can take your hub motor apart it means the interfaces between bearings and their shafts and housing are slide fitted. I've found even with all steel parts, both 1020 and even 1144 steel, the shaft and housing will deteriorate due to the shock loading of a skate wheel.  In the past I've use the best high heat retaining fluid available, loctite 620, this stuff is bearing glue and stops "creep" within the housing and on the shaft, which slowly eats away at them as the bearing bangs around, it's an epoxy, but it can't handle the loads and heat and deteriorates and you're back to loose metal on loose metal and the creep continues.  Simply put loose keeps getting looser and any machinist can look at these slide fitted motors and tell you it won't last

 
http://www.nmbtc.com/bearings/engineering/fitting/

If, worse, the motor uses an aluminum bearing housing or shaft, the deformation values of even 7000 series aluminum are way under even the softest steel, and they also have huge thermal expansion.    if anything rattles it'll keep rattling and get worse till the motor is done. 
After selling 140 motors and them being out there for a long time I can tell you this from my own experience and feedback.  I wouldn't sell a hub motor anywhere there's a mandatory guarantee on products because if someone actually rides a decent amount of time on a slide fitted motor it's likely to be a paperweight before the year is over.
This goes for what I sold, Jacobs, raptor2, Carvon, and everything I've ever seen.  
Even hardened steel skate axles deteriorate and they aren't subject to the loading of a hub motor.  
Loose always gets looser was obvious but  also galvanic corrosion between the shaft and bearings was an interesting surprise.  Just like a battery the slightly disimmilar metals touching produces an electrical reaction which also eats away at the metal.  When ur playing with an airgap between rotor and stator that's .4mm things must be precision and slide fittings ain't it

It likely is subject to less shock loading with the motors out of the wheel and that's a big plus.  I imagine it would do much better but don't know for sure of course and we will have to see.   It'd be nice to hear feedback from people who've had hub motors for a long time and get their experience with the mechanical side of things.

I see a lot of promise in direct drive motors, (outside the wheel). This also allows you to use your own choice of wheels with plenty of urethane for dampening and riding comfort, never having to worry about finding replacement urethane for your hubmotor. This would probably help in solving some issues with the slide fit you mentioned.

Ti alloy can be better than steel at avoiding creep with slide fittings but expensive and much harder to machine.  Steel is good though and the  easier solution is a motor with interference fittings. I think the scorpion shaft is much more so there for weight savings.

I think so too, but it will take so many Amps to drive a direct drive pneumatic tire. I'm interested to see how their V3 motors with pneumatics will perform. I'm have an EVO2 and an extra pair of V3's on preorder and will be testing out their pnuematics as soon as they are available :).

I'd love to see someone apply a downsized full floating rear axle design. This would have to be a departure from traditional skateboard designs but would allow for 2wd boards with a single more powerful motor. There are already people exploring the use of helical gearing in direct drive satellite motors. This is great because it takes the motor away from direct road vibration like in hub motors. I also had a thought about a hub motor design where the wheels were much larger and there is an air gap between the motor and outer urethane. This would require some kind of suspension that would essentially "float" the motor in the wheel and limiting road vibration. The motor shaft would still be under the same loads but vibration to the motor would at least be eased.

Have you seen the rear drive on the CARVON REV EVO? is a rear single motor dual belt drive with freewheel to allow the rear motors to spin at lower speed when the front hub motors pass the max speed of the belt drive rear.

With a floating axle that axle still experiences the same loads and would need to be an interference fit or the same issues.  Two wheels on one axle and one wheel floats and the other is driven would be nice and work but then it's an inrunner and hard to get the torque. All those gearing methods take up space that could be motor and are all noise making parts that will wear down as well. The easy solution, which is the typical way shock loaded shafts and housings are dealt with... Interference fittings on steel

As just said I guess u could use a single motor to drive two wheels just can't brake

Amp control via the vesc is essential, that's what you can't use a regular 12s esc with his system. 

It will be interesting to see. Hopefully a combination of vesc settings and sensored set up will help.

@BigBoyToys

This? Yep. Low torque helper motor. Def will defeat the low torque issue. But in my opinion, the dual doesn't suffer from low torque...at 10s the dual hauls ass and fast, can't even imagine what it would be at 12s. Prob pretty insane. But that motor will help lessen the start up stress and low speed stress.

https://instagram.com/p/BGgRAwhI7vr/







But at discussion here is abt the longevity of hub motors...and based on @Hummie real world experience, hubs will eventually fail because of the vibrations. But is there an ideal design to combat issue? Is it an issue with the hubs out now and coming out soon?

The solution is the same the world round for heavily shock-loaded shafts and it's steel shafts and interference fittings.  dont know about ti but from what I read it doesn't do well with interference fittings but maybe could be kept as a slide fitting if it had high deformation number


I didn't just come to say everything sucks without saying I have something better!  I'll be shrink fitting and winding the new motors, which will match the abec11 centrax wheel size/shape  at 83x78.  loooong wheel with a long motor over double the size of the old stuff I sold.   Interference fitted steel housings AND shaft, as appropriate for heavy shock loads.  also nice as there's no rattling noise.   The sound of a motor deteriorating.

Which brings up all these hub motor put a lot more leverage on an axle to say nothing of torque.  a typical axle has (2) 7mm bearings and an 8mm gap between so there is ..22mm of lever possible.  Hub motors on the other hand, all of them, are going way beyond that and still staying with an 8mm axle.  I've heard of them bending and I've heard of them breaking

@Hummie it just makes sense to over engineer it so that we can't break it. But cost comes into factor. Is it possible to basically build an indestructible hub at a reasonable price? Is such a motor possible? 

I definitely think there is a market for a durable hub that is easily fixable. I think people will extra pay for that.

carvon has been selling slide fitted motors for a long time. A hardened axle/shaft will take a lot before it wears enough to allow the stator to hit magnets if there's a big airgap especially, and maybe even slide fitted aluminum housings for the bearings will last a long time too due to the large surface area loads can be distributed through, but if you want things to last years and you don't want to hear it rattling more and more, and you want the small airgap precision that allows a stronger motor I doubt there's another way than pressed steel. (Going with ti and slide fittings maybe but that has other obstacles in the making and cost)  If it's pressed steel I believe it could last forever because the shafts and housings don't suffer in use when they are pressed.  If they aren't then they're always deteriorating.

IMO is not about loser and winners at all, but a way to start a discussion on a topic that as a community **we all have failed miserably** to properly address it, in some instances some design have succeeded in tackling the problem but not to the extend to declare victory. 

The points here are all valid and at the minimum will steer the conversation in a way that can change the design philosophy, which can benefit the community as a whole.

This entire thread is a very bizarre attempt to launch a new product design that is somehow superior to all other existing designs.

The best way of doing this would be simply to admit that the first iterations had some issues but the New design is improved / better because of XYZ changes.

Then provide some details or data to prove that the changes are likely to be beneficial.

Claiming that everything on the market "sucks" and is doomed to fail, without having any first hand experience of each product, is a hard pill swallow.

Well, yes we all know your new RSpec Ghost motors are awesome. We all know they will be the best hub motors ever seen on any planet. We all take it for granted that they wil hold up forever.

Oh wait, it is 1st of april.

We can talk again about the durability of your oh so awesome stuff when it is out and has actually been used in many different situations and environments. 

But for now this Statement seems to fit.
Maybe Mellow will have better ones, but tthey are not on the market yet.

Comeing to delivery of proof.
We have a proverb here in germany: "Don't throw stones when you live in a glass house."
BTW: You are also very good at admitting issues.

I think this thread will be mostly about technical limitations and discussion on how to migitate them and just a little bit of sales by @Hummie and now also by you, who would have expected that.

More or less I also agree with hub motor disadvantages. They are not mean to last the longest due to size, precision and direct hit to the ground. Non hub direct drive is a nice approach to go, this I agree. Nevertheless I still love those big right off the shelf urethane that fits right into the board without modufication. They are known, rounder, easy to replace.

In general, if hub motors are so bad,  please show me all the evidence?

If it is true, there must be hundreds of cases of reported failures?

So. Some evidence is all I ask....

It wouldn't be fair to ask how long the ghost motor will last as they haven't been around for more than a couple months to test, but there's no magic in the new enertion logo and they're subject to the same laws of physics as everything.  If it's a slide fit, and if it's aluminum especially, it's loose on its way to looser. Thats the laws of physics that is unavoidable and any and every machinist who knows anything will agree. Maybe just increase the airgap

But a reliable hub motor is possible. As I keep saying all it needs is interference fittings and the material that can do that..steel



pointing to Jacobs design as a stepping stone isn't reassuring onloop.  I bought them too years ago and there's a thread on endless sphere showing how all of us were fed a lot of bull and got crap that was not even rideable and a lot of people didn't get their money back.

Well hummie. Your marketing strategy is really strange. So more or less you are saying all you sold in the last years is crap and everybody who knows something about materials should have always known. That means you sold crap to your costumers and you knew it. And now the 12 mm axle changes everything, bla bla bla. 
Your just trying to seed the idea in people's heads that hubs don't work. As well as all the other stuff where you tried that people start to doubt about enertion products and especially the Raptor 2.

I made already about 400 km on the first  prototype of the Raptor 2 hubs. No issues so far. And this prototype works awesome in FOC and is also more efficient then my 6355 R-SPEC in BLDC. And they have a 14 teeth motor pulley instead of the standard 15 mm pulley the Raptor comes with. (the 15mm would make it less efficient). And the acceleration is stronger then I ever could do on my R-SPEC. Not that the R-SPEC dont have the power. But the belt would start to slip. Had a peak of 3800 watts with the hubs so far but you don't need that power honestly. Hard to not fall of the board when doing full acceleration and for carving it is too much.
And brake performance is much stronger. No chance to achieve that with my 9mm belt system because of belt slip. 
And also the temperature was never an issue for me. One time I drove them a lot uphill at full speed for hill climb tests. I could still touch them and measured 55 degrees at the hottest position. Of course I have not the steepest hills and I am not the  heaviest guy. But when you think about it that the motors will be also fine with more than 100 degrees then it should be OK. I am like 80 kilos with clothes so I think I am very close to the average rider.

These are only my experiences and no marketing.

300 miles of testing!! Not even an appetizer. 
Let's hear from you in a year or maybe even two at the rate you seem to ride.

I'm not trying to market so much as revealing the details of what I learned over the last year.  If u want to talk about mechanical obstacles of a hub motor that's what this is about. 

 I'm a hobbyist with a passion for this stuff and not a business man.  But what I made, even the first all aluminum version, would still outlast the ghost because the design allowed the motor interfaces to be  held with retaining fluid effectively making it an interference fitting and that lasts till it gets cooked out.
I'm done repeating the same info. If anyone doubts what I'm saying ask a machine shop.  I've sold over 140 motors and it's been a long time they've been out there.  I told every detail of their material and construction.  no secrets here.  they were all prototypes to be learned from.  Mechanically they're ALL STILL WORKING but people who've ridden a lot, including myself, tell the same story of things loosening.   I'm telling how to avoid this problem with hub motors.

This is ridiculous....

From what i have read above, he is saying that his design is bad, his tolerances are bad and his motors didn't last because it was a bad design.

He follows from that with a conclusion that due to his bad results everyone must have bad results because "physics" ?

The so called "physics" he refers to is all based around the argument of **Slide fit VS Interference fit?** 

I'm sorry but that's not "physics" it's machine engineering and it's not so simple that you can simply treat it as "black and white" there are many levels of fitment and it involves very precise tolerance control.

Of course based on your hubs...the size of your hubs caused the axel failure...you just gave it more leverage by extending it. Basically, running over a rock near the center puts less force than a rock ran over by the end of your wheel....... 
The hubs out now are close to spec...at least enough as not to need a 12mm axel.  In the case of your hubs, who's to say 12mm is enough? When does it become a ridiculous size? Most of the hubs out are trying to look like regular wheels as opposed to yours.  
So, to defeat the strain we need to put the esk8 stuff on steroids? Bigger wheel, axle, bearings etc...it's not looking like a longboard wheel to me

If it was impossible to hold a bearing in place, planes would to fall, cara would drive on each other and so on

The truth is, pure interference fit is not always enough. Is it enough for a hub motor? I don't know, it requires a complex analysis of the problem and measurement and determination of all loading scenarios and lots of data capture

What's is done on most machines and equipments is even with interference fit you have a secondary locking method, a lid, a cir clip, counter nut and so on

In my machine element class if you submit one of the projects and it has a bearing being fixed only by interference consider yourself reproved, but this is kind of extreme case, but good practice, hub motors don't have lots of free space, is all about compromises

The best way for us to determine that is to watch what's is happening with everyone's hub's and take action from there

Just for the sake of expanding the field. 

We Don't want a satellite system or want an alternative to a satellite system. 
So why revolve the conversation around hub motors ? 

When all we want is an alternative to satellite systems and the whole shit to be attach on the same axel as the motors. 
For  this we can be discussing straight up direct drives, direct drives with planetary gearing and so much more but instead we are having a conversation among peacocks.

Nice !

I'm sorry but that's not "physics" it's machine engineering and it's not so simple that you can simply treat it as "black and white" there are many levels of fitment and it involves very precise tolerance control.
[/quote]

regardless if you want to call it machine engineering or physics, your picture with the different fits...are you anywhere on it other than in the "loose" area?  it seems that's all anyone does and in which case things don't have to be very precise.   Wondering if you think it would be possible to do interference fittings anywhere on that motor or if you had plans to.  Maybe it's not possible.    How about looking into the thermal expansion, and deformation values, and surface area, of the aluminum housings and figure out if it's possible.   some machine engineering.  interference fitting heavily loaded aluminum housings...maybe it would work.  Then you'd at least have half interference fittings on the softer metal side

@Trillium
do you have anything made yet?  can you elaborating on what you're talking about.  Are you doing intereference fittings on aluminum?  That seems more complicated but maybe it could be done and last

@Kaly don't know why peacocks but those other drive methods..as long as they aren't heavily loaded, like a hub motor is, then they shouldn't need the interference fitting.  Probably better to have the slightest interference fit anyway
@Michaelinvegas
U ask a lot of questions that I forget but The 12mm axle is for the greater leverage and torque. All motors are putting double if not triple the leverage in the axle. Axles need steroids yes.  The bearing interfaces being interference fits is so the shafts and housings the bearings are on don't get deformed by shock loads that the motors experience.

Working with hummie, I have been testing his small motors for about a year now. I have put somewhere in the ball park of 1500 miles on them in that time. Over time, I have noticed that the bearings start to wobble a bit (not enough to make them unusable, but enough that I can notice it). When you look at where the bearing sits, you'll see some very slight wearing away of metal. I experience this same thing on my regular skateboard after some time. At some point, with the tight airgap of these motors, the stator will start rubbing on the magnets. Then the motor will short, and it will be dead.

Unless the raptor 2 is doing a pressed fit bearing, than you can expect to see the same deterioration. The rate will depend on the materials used and the loads on the bearings. It's possible they could last long enough to at least get out of the warranty phase, but unless you press fit them, you'll see wear over time.

300 miles is nothing in hindsight. This is why you can't rush the release of a product @onloop. You love to talk shit about how long we are taking to build a complete. But do we just overlook the minor details and assume that the problems of others can't also be our problem, or do we test long enough to find those problems? 3 months for a new motor, new board, ect. is not enough time to test. Look at Mellow. They could have been one of the first hubs on the market, but they didn't want a crappy product. They wanted a flawless product. They cost a fortune, but I bet they won't fall apart on anyone. What do you think makes you so different that you can skip the long term testing phase? Short term tests showed me some of the flaws of these motors as they are now, but it didn't show me the biggest flaw of them. This is why we're sitting and not just releasing a product.

@Hummie and @evoheyax reasonable observations indeed. 

Maybe we should just make call this thread, Why all bearings will fail. Lol

It's interesting to hear abt the failures and how they are over come. As @Mikenopolis mentioned it would be interesting to see mellow pipe in on this from their experience. Myknowledge is limited to carvons at the most basic level. 

But it all makes sense, what everyone says. But there can't be only one way to resolve the issue...is there? There can't be one issue with hubs that kills them? Are all hub motor designs the same? Will making stronger parts make it last longer? Will making it bigger make it last longer? 

Hubs are new territory for esk8 ... I guess will shall all see

Steel,... aluminum maybe in the future.. requires a lot of care to do aluminum.. would need thick cross section at least 5mm so takes a lot of space

I have had 3 prototypes spinning. All 28 pole in 75mm wheel. It's sort of silly how I did it but I wanted to push the limits of smaller diameter motors because that's the only way to get the weight and form factor down to a normal place.

Interesting.  Hope u don't mind the detailed questions, it's an info forum and I'd like to think we can all share our info.  So ur using steel shafts and housings. What type? I'm doing 1144 for the shafts and 1020 for the rotor. And how much interference did u put and is it on both sides of both bearings?  Getting parts cut to such a detail was hard to find. I'm doing just .005mm on all surfaces. Not much but recommended.  With the shrink fit it holds better than a press fitting and will see

U have any pics or 3D drawings of the design
@onloop nothing redicilous about it.  I'm not saying my design sucks...I'm saying anything with slide fittings does.  What's your tolerances and what material they sitting on.  The fact that you say u tried lots of stuff and they're all mechanically fine makes me think you're in the dark
@Michaelinvegas the bearings might be fine with use as they're the hardest material and it's the shafts and housings that rattle their way down

You sound envious and it seems like you're trying to pick a fight with Onloop arround every corner. It looks kinda silly.


Ontopic:
How many miles should a hub motor last? If the hub motors break down after 3000 miles because of mentioned problems, for how much people would that be a problem? And 5000/10000/etc?

Heavy usage scenario:
Work - home commute (10 km + 10 km) when the following criteria are met:
- above 10 degrees
- not raining

That might be 200 days per year in some scenerio's. So thats 200 traveldays x 20 km per year. = 4000 km
On top of that the board is used for fun an extra 40 km per week. 40 x 52 = 2080 km

So 6080 km per year sounds reasonable for a heavy user. So thats 12160 km for two years.

Could Raptor 2/Enertion/Mellow hub motors avarage 12160 km's before breaking? What do you guys think? I don't think a high % of people would come close to that many km's per year though.

If 10% of users make enough km's per year to wear the motors out in two years. The company providing warrenty should't have a hard time keeping everyone happy.

Is a much higher percentage breaks down the situation could get ugly I assume.

I am sure @Mellow will do that without problems, they beat the shit out of their products in testing and i am sure they have some prototypes that already have done more and they have done over 2 years of R&D in Hub motors so i am sure they have come across these difficulties as well.

If the Raptor 2 will do it? (Based on my experience with them:)
Maybe. I doubt that the first 200 will hold up based on previous experiences with enertion, even if it is just "the Manufacturers fault". In the past, their ideas, their innovation and their marketing always were miles ahead of the Processes and the Products.
Until i get some unbiased review, i dont believe that the Raptor 2 will be as good or as long lasting as onloop tells. Which does not mean it is a bad product.

If the loads that make it to the shafts and housings can be quantified I'm sure you could figure exactly  how long till the play formed on them will be enough to make stator and rotor rub. At that point it won't short but the motor will get hot from both frictions and the stator laminations get smudged together and greater heat due to eddy currents.  Luckily the magnet plating has shown super durable.  But before the motor gets to this state, which is almost worthless, it'll rattle. I hate rattling wheels.

I love the work you've done, and I'm glad to hear the great results you've had so far testing them.

I just think that, like you said, this is new territory. I would be amazed if anyone in the this industry makes a motor that is flawless on the first go. It sounds like Jason has learned a lot from watching the problems others have had with these. But like you said, this is new territory. Extensive testing is needed, because me and others testing hubs haven't listed out everything we've learned from working with hub motors. This is a problem we have been worried about for a few months, since we started seeing it for our selfs. I ride a min of 10 miles a day. And doing that, it took 8 months before I started noticing this. I don't think 3 months of testing before shipping will show this problem, which is why I say test it more before shipping.

@jadatmag I don't want to fight with anyone. I would rather have a discussion about pros and cons of certain techniques, and for everyone to share information freely (since this is an education forum after all). But the second I mention something, Jason attacks me with the classic "show me what you have thats better" argument. There's never any good discussion that leads to determining if the suggested problem is really a problem or not, and if so, the fix, which is what I'm after, not a fight. We see things differently clearly. I want him to see my point of view, which is that his experience with hub motors has been limited, and making a new type of product you've never made before requires extensive testing. He wants to only do short term testing. I believe long term testing (1 year+ of heavy usage) is reuired to know theirs no flaws in your design. Jason has been working hard to paint that image in your head that I'm jealous or something of what he's managed to do. Everytime I bring up a possible flaw, he paints that image again, instead of having an educated discussion that leads to him building an even better product. I am not jealous though. I am inspired by his relentless determination, and I would love for his products to live up to the hype he creates for them. What I am is annoyed when people make absurd claims and refuse to back them up. Then I'm told to prove him wrong. The burden of proof is on the seller, not the buyer.

If I claim to have a board that flys, and then tell you to prove it doesn't, you now have to buy my board. Of course it doesn't fly, so you wasted your money, but who cares, I already have your money. That seems to be the logic here behind enertion. And when people complain, they don't get a refund without making a fuss and a scene on the forum, and he just keeps getting new customers, so it's not about keeping a loyal base, it's about finding new customers who don't know the last thing you sold failed for a lot of people and you failed to hold your warranty for them because you came up with an excuse not to. That was my experience multiple times over with enertion, which is why I'm so critical of the claims Jason makes. I feel for the hype at one point, and was left feeling scammed with a product that did not do what it was advertised to do.

Material with Higher deformation numbers for the shaft and housing. An interference fitting is a necessity though if u really want it to last.  Even hardened steel skate axles wear down.  The motor airgap is so small and any loss in the material or deformation of the material on the shaft and housing and it shows up in the airgap and eventually rubs
But everything else, the magnets, stator, wire,...it all holds well if the motor leads are solidly connected. Could last forever it seems. U could even pot all that stuff in resin and then it'll never vibrate wires creating a short

I know personal stuff comes in play but, Good to focus on issues on possible weak points and how to make things better, than to talk abt what hub motor is better ... I think that will help keep arguments to a low...

We talk abt distances, air gaps, resin etc...how abt materials and design? Are the suggestions you are making real improvements or are they just bandaids because there is a design issue? 

I'm no expert, but in my mind...I can only see a few ways to build a hub motor.... the only thing that changes is the quality of the materials used.  Is that the defining answer? A magic combination of both?

hits to the motor can and overheating are the two main reasons of hub motors failing from what I'm guessing from my experience of "user" (I don't know anything about mech. engineering, just guessing)

imho it would be good to make extreme stress tests of motor temperature (high power, high resistance for a long time)  which could be done on a test bench and mechanical stress test like riding (heavy rider) on cobblestone (a lot of vibrations) or going down hard 1 step (big hit on the motor can) repeadetly.  
Do you guys think that the lateral forces too would affect more than heavvy vibrations - like when carving at high speed? 

With my belt drive I usually go on top of anything, the most that can happen is that the belt loosens a bit (or breaks) if I take a lot of vibrations or a big hit

With hubs I try to not go over bumps/cracks as much as I can because I don't want to damage the motor. I tried [smts](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/Electric-skateboard-longboard-hub-motor-kit-for-DIY/32564618716.html?ws_ab_test=searchweb0_0,searchweb201602_2_10065_10130_10068_10136_10137_10138_10060_10062_10141_10056_10055_10054_10059_10099_10103_10102_10096_10148_10052_10053_10050_10107_10142_10051_10143_10084_10083_10080_10082_10081_10110_10111_9979_10112_10113_10114_130_10037_10032_10078_10079_10077_10073_10070_10123_10124-9979,searchweb201603_6,afswitch_1,ppcSwitch_5,single_sort_0_default&btsid=4d5faf33-aad4-4508-a781-2ce9e67ac02c&algo_expid=a284ea17-19cd-4bde-9f35-4bcaeeced3db-9&algo_pvid=a284ea17-19cd-4bde-9f35-4bcaeeced3db) and the version I had last 1y ago [failed](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/the-mkv-1-sensored-6374-vesc-koston-deck-lipo-6s-10a-psychotillers-enclosure/2298/7?u=makevoid) in the first weeks, Carvons v.2.5 (at least for now) are holding up very well - unfortunately here in london uk around where I live the roads are not very good and on bike paths and in parks there are a lot of bumps made for bikes but not for skates lol  - I haven't tried jacob hubs enough time to tell but they seemed to accumulate more heat than the carvons. Also probably for all the light riders / riders that have the luxury of going on perfect asphalt hubs will be fine.

I can ramble on an on but people will be annoyed soon. U need interference fitted bearings and the materials that can stand the loads that will be transmitted through them. Steel is an easy choice.   If u can open the motor up without a press then it's slide fitted and will not last nearly as long.   If it's slide fitted aluminum good luck and best to ride it maybe once a month and then it might last

Nothing last forever...they can last for a long time....
So...what is a reasonable life of a hub motor? Are hub motors designed to be fixed down the road? Or are they one use items, but can be fixed like vacuum cleaners? We've seen Carvon give people the option to upgrade their older sets to lower kv. Will hubs be like that? How user fixable are they? Easy enough to slap together an esk8 but add tearing into a motor to service could be a big stretch for some.

A hub motor can last forever!  Magnets don't lose their strength for a very long time as long as they don't get too hot and they make high heat magnets (which is definately worth getting in a hub motor and should be asked by a buyer what magnets are in it as it defines the continuous power before the motor gets damaged) and all the other parts other than the bearings in there... if you get good high temp wire,...forever 

Pressed bearings u have to press the motor apart with a press to service and if it's slide fit it's much easier to service as it'll fall apart and no pressing necessary, but if it's all slide fittings on aluminum especially you might not have a shaft or housing that's any good anymore and not worth servicing.  You can't fix a ruined shaft or housing but u can add retaining fluid on a damaged shaft or any fitting that isn't too loose and that can be really good until it deteriorates from the heat and shock loads and that could be a couple months

just a couple posts back you said you've tested lots of hub motors and they were all mechanically fine and now "they were all pretty shit"?    I think you'll say anything.
That video you posted of you riding on those motors is a blast from the past!   you are proud to be involved in those Jacob motors, version 6 supposedly, that many of us bought and showed to be totally unridable and lots of us lost our money.  Infact you can hear the rubbing of those crap motors in that video you just posted above!!! click click click.   They all went out to us with so much confirmation of legitimacy.  They were the reason I started making motors!  

The saddest thing is how people eat it up.  just browsing your site trying to find out the mysteries of the raptor, pushing on info links for the separate parts it's all empty info.  the magnets optimized for torque, and the special steel, and super bearings or whatever you're calling them.  the empty wording goes on and on but people dont know and you're not going to say.    
Youre the big winner in a risky game with your year warranty.   With what must certainly be an aluminum housing for that big bearing, and what must all be slide fittings ..I dont think the patent pending heat removal is going to mater.   

are you going to tell us if its aluminum or if it's slide fitting or just keep posting allusions to higher science? you dont need high science.  slide or press?  aluminum or not?  its really that simple

im curious how the tire stays on too.  there are all those little screws for it in the exploded view but not on real pics.

AND WE AREN'T TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW LONG BEARINGS WILL LAST.  THAT IS NOT THE ISSUE.  HOW LONG WILL THE SHAFT AND HOUSING LAST

You are still stuck in 2015 because you have zero budget for R&D, that's because you sold your products at near cost price... which was a really bad idea which ultimately cost both you & Jacob the chance to have a very viable business. Developing new products is very expensive!

So please, don't try to drag legitimate businesses down with you because you haven't made any progress.... 

Go back to the drawing board, make a proper business plan, rethink your tolerance stack-up's, work closer with your manufacturing partners & stop making up excuses.

I dont have any problems though.   You dont even have something out and it has all the problems i found last year!  It's your forum and of course you would love to control the perception of what you sell, but it's ,,,somewhat..a public forum (pour a drip for Devin) and I spent a year figuring out why I wouldn't want to do what you're selling and I've explained why.

and I've been put in a holding pattern on the site for a bit.  I guess trying to simmer me down.  To me this is what I spent a year figuring out, that a hub motor needs a better mechanical design.  I tell the world openly, but onloop you've seemed to go "all in" on your hub motors and now it must succeed.  I'll wait to see if this is an information forum so we can all learn and get better stuff or a marketing platform.    I'm obviously not very money driven and in my mind just told everyone the most important detail on making a hub motor.  I'm a forum junky.  I like to tell my stuff.  I like to work with others with the same interests.  I like to write.  You should've listened to me all along as I told of this problem long ago.

When is it a 'problem' ?

How many KM should the hub last?

Before this is answered who cares about how many KM it actually lasts?

If the hub dies after 20 000 km the design might be flawed for other purposes, but not for skateboarding.

In my opinion if the hubs survive over 10 000 km they're good enough. If people make more KM's in one/two years the seller should help out and there isn't any problem.

IMO, 10,000 KM is good enough for a motor also for my purposes. But as I said, it only took 1/5th of that to start noticing the issues this thread is all about. I know I won't get to 10,000 KM with these motors due to the fact they are slide fit and not press fit. The fit when they where new was very tight, so tight that it was hard to get the bearings on. When I take the motors apart now, they have a hair size of play. Not an insane amount, but enough that I bet 1 more year of use like this is all they will last. That's less than 5000 km of use.

Design of the motor will obviously have an effect on the rate of decay. But without pressed fit bearings, you can't escape this decaying... It will happen. Really, vibrations will do this, no matter the design of the motor.

@onloop I will tip my hat to your work, You seem to have spent more time researching hub motors than I give you credit for. The thing is, it goes back to what hummie said, about whether this is a marketing platform or an informational forum. In all manners of R & D besides these motors, you make sure the world sees all of the work you've put into R & D. 2 years back when I got my first pairs of carvons, you said you didn't understand how a 149kv hub motor could even work with the vesc, and the impression your remarks about my use of them seemed to imply you didn't see a future in hub motors (especially because you followed up by saying something about satellite config motors being better). I knew of your work with Jacob in his motor quest, but I guess I assumed you stopped that after his work fell apart, since you seemed determined to stick with the satellite config biased on the comments you had made and what you were promoting publicly. I never saw you saw one good thing about hub motors up until recently, and you always said satellite was better. I'm sorry if I offended you by accusing you of not having much experience with hubs.

However, these last iteration of your hub motors seem to be the first real modify you've done to the motors, since the videos you posted in the past while you where waiting for your prototypes where Jacobs old motors. With the mods you made from the old design to this new design, it has only been a few months of testing, which I think is still too short of a test a modified design. Changing one little thing in a motor can drastically change the way the motors wear and tear. And it seems like you changed quite a bit from the old motors. I just don't see how you can test for such a short of a time and feel confident that nothing will go wrong in the long term, even if this was your 10th iteration. The fact that most of this board was sold with CAD drawings and shipped 6 months later speaks that there will be limited real world testing. You do you, but like I've said before, I want you to be successful. I'm looking at a different customer base. In order to ride the boards I'm making, you will need experience riding a weaker board, but still very powerful board, such as the raptor 2. I'm not trying to brag, this is why I hate text like this. You can't tell my actual emotions behind what I'm saying. Your success is paramount to any success I could have. It builds the industry, and builds a potential customer base for me, when people want even more. So everything I've said, is not from a point of jealously like you think it is. I'm thinking the bigger picture here. It's not about bashing your product. It's about offering my opinions of areas of improvement, based on all of the experience I've had testing many different hub motors over the past 2 years and different battery technologies, so it can help grow the industry. We both want the same outcome for the community, so why do we have to fight about it? I don't want to fight. But I can't even mention a potential flaw with out being accused of having an alternative motive.

I go over cracks, rough streets, cobblestones, expansion joints, off curbs, and over rocks on a regular basis with my Carvon hubs. So far, no issues. Been riding for 6 months now on my Carvon V2.5 and it's still rock solid. 

I do realize that it will fail at some point. Practically all my skate gear that I haven't replaced because I simply wanted an upgrade has failed or been replaced because it was getting too that point. I don't know how many sets of bearings I've purchased, but I do know that I generally keep 3 or 4 extra new sets on hand. Bushings have gone bad, decks have cracked, Trucks have bent, hardware has broken, wheels have coned... 

Every hub will fail at some point, but I seriously doubt my Carvon will only last a year or so. It may not last 5, but I wouldn't expect any board to go that long without needing repairs.

Also, 10,000km would be a pretty damn good run for any hub motor or any esk8 for that matter. Most will never go nearly that far before they replace their board simply because they want something new. For someone with a 10k commute, that's 2 years if you did that every work day. Out of all the esk8ers on the planet, that's only a handful of people.  Even 5,000km would be a good run.

Neat. I wonder how efficient it Is. It's relying on eddy currents to keep the  shaft centered and also the design is trying to reduce eddy currents it says, as the eddy currents I think would be the only drag.

This last video looks like the best thing in a hubmotor since forever. And simple. The only obstacle in making it into a hub motor would be the same old extreme loading.  Unlike the first link u put up, which would replace a bearing, this thing needs a couple bearings between the different rings.  they could be super thin though, as the design needs them to be, and the radial an axial load from riding on the road could be transmitted through just the outer bearing That sits on the shaft and housed in the case structure.  Maybe.  It's the best thing I've seen. And the windings on the outside allows it to cool better (well maybe not in a hub motor so much).   So simple in a way yet so foreign.  damn making me want to change everything .  I bet it pops on the market in a hub motor.  It's not proprietary tech I don't think. Anyone could build and sell it.

I've had three differen pairs of hub motors now. Bent axles on Carvon's, slipped urathane and spun the stator on the press fit axle sleeve on Jacobs and have a problems with the urathane retaining ring loosening on Dexters hubs. All the hubs I've tried have developed freeplay(slop) pretty quickly. I'll admit that I ride hard and fast I'm basically a Samoan Gorilla so these hubs might not have had problems for lighter riders at 20mph.
I'd love to see press fit bearings and larger axles on future iterations of hub motors but will take what ever you guys have to offer in the meantime :smile:

You are the leading expert in motor design and engineering? Are you not? The answer should be obvious to you.

The stainless steel axle is not being subjected to shearing loads or rotational forces. The internal shaft of the motor is seated on a fixed 12mm wide square boss that is bearing all of the shearing and rotational loads. The stainless steel axle is primarily exposed to tensile loads.

An 8mm 304 stainless steel axle can bear around 145000 pounds per square inch of force before elongation.

That aluminum square your saying is going to take all the load, it's a slide fit into another aluminum part.  From what I can tell you have to tighten re two parts together using the outer nut. That also requires compressing the bearings. You can't tighten it more than a certain amount.  Yea I'm feeling like an expert on hub motors these days seeing what I've seen come out and how they've lasted compared to what I had made.

Looking at this maybe we can disect where the weakest links will be when loaded 

  The small bearing sits on the steel shaft and It will transfer THE MAJORITY of the load on the wheel to the steel axle it sits on which is maybe a 4 inch span.  The support for the axle is not enough with maybe an inch of its end sscrewed and pinned into an aluminum housing.   there will be huge leverage there
The other bigger bearing will transfer load to the aluminum blue shaft and from there the load is transferred again to the aluminum black square at the end of the hanger. I see doom written all over these aluminum slide fittings from axial loading and the torque of the motor.  But first before it has time to deteriorate it'll just snap.

Hope everyone is considering the added leverage a hub motor places on the system. It's a whole new realm when compared to traditional non-motor core wheels.

Not an engineer, just someone who knows ride-quality logic and has been riding and selling longboards and skateboards for a very long time. Including threaded axle precision trucks like: Aera, Rogue, Ronin, Surf Rodz etc...

Think about how much compliance is at the outer lip of any wider traction shaped wheel without a motor in it. Even race wheels with supportive cores have a ton of compliance when compared to a hub motor. It's why wheels cone - the outer lips flex, while the more supported inner lips and center of the wheel flex less.

Wide hub motors with a steel-can core, and just a few millimeters of thane depth at the very outer lip???

Next level leverage in a scary way...

I do agree it looks to thin. I can bend 8mm hardened stainless steel axle by hand and probably permanently if i tried. There is no way onloop is going to change his design so close to release though he has something that should last for majority of people and probably most important for him it will likely make it past warranty period. We will see soon enough. For now hummie I would suggest just do you and design your next hub motor.

Should not have included precision Rogues, as they're a through axle truck... Which brings me to where I feel the concern should be:

Most hub motors till now have been mounted to through-axle cast trucks, which can handle leverage better than a threaded in axle. How much the axle is supported by the hanger before the treads determines how much the axle wants to rip out the threaded ALUMINUM hanger (insert, or not).

IMO rotational and shear forces are not that concerning. The leveraging forces on the threads in the ALUMINUM hanger, and the face of the ALUMINUM hanger are.

I think it depends on how you ride. If you don't carve hard a lot, you're not going to stress the outer lip of your wheel as much. With Esk8, carving hard is not necessary. If you're going down a hill or your at high speed and need to turn, you can hit the brakes.

I know you've got lenghty conversion here.. but the thing that would trouble me would be hitting curbs / gaps with these axles (and hub motors, itself)

Combined with speed and rider's weight I think the impacts can sometimes be pretty bad..especially if urethane  is not that thick or the motor is not mounted in ''direct drive''.

Of course, this should not be a problem if the places u tend to ride your board on are perfectly smooth and flat :)

Also unlike other hub, these are design as a complete assembly with a second internal shaft at 12mm as @onloop explain before. Don't forget these hub aren't design to fit on any trucks wich make the assemble solid as a rock. Unlike @Hummie who try to fit a motor on a trucks that a no purpose to fiting a motor.... and Btw on @hummie experiment the axle wan't going all the way throught the motor, and the axle was damage by human manipulation 😉

Somewhat true, and in all fairness, I like to surf and snowboard on pavement in a way the wears wheels very quickly.

If you're just standing there pressing a button on a smooth surface it's a little different, but not entirely...

Even going straight, any debris experienced by the outer lips of a hub motor will transmit to the hanger in a much harsher way.

I look at it this way. After hundreds of miles on a set of wheels on my esk8, my wheels are barely coning. My drive wheel is wearing down faster than my other wheels, but the wear is fairly even. Nothing like what I would see on my regular boards with much much fewer miles. If your wheels are not coning after a few hundred miles, it's pretty safe to say that you're not spending a lot of time riding your outer edges. 

I do carve quite a bit when going down hills or just for fun (since you can), but not nearly as much or in the same way, mile per mile, as I do when riding my regular board. For many who never skated much or at all before they started with Esk8, I don't think having less thane on the outer wheel edge is that much of a problem. 

Personally, I prefer more thane on my outer edge because I like the additional grip I get from the deformed wheel. One of the reasons I went with a Carvon hub, but that's only because of the way I skate. Most of the people I see on their esk8's don't carve much.

There isn't another internal shaft for the outer bearing.  It was not explained.  The pics I see have the bearing on the 8mm shaft.   If u have a pic showing it please show it.  Even if there were another shaft..what do you think would support it..the same 8mm shaft. Another 12mm shaft on top of the 8...why bother as all the force on the far end of the motor is still going on the 8mm.
The idea that you could just slow down before turning is hardly a solution. And if u hit a rock going straight the load on the axle is still there
An accurate representation of the loads is as @SolidSurfer shows with ur red circle but the green would be on top of the end of the hanger aluminum.  The black square

I get that's where the load ends up. 

I was just suggesting how much more potential load / force there is at the hanger face by showing where the outermost wheel bearings are located of a hub motor versus a non hub motor wheel. It's a lot easier to create loads at the red point than the green from a leverage standpoint, isn't it?

@JohnnyMeduse. rock solid doesn't come with slide fitting anything. Maybe retaining fluid will keep it feeling solid till it cooks out and then not solid.  A shaft is a shaft regardless of any marketing hype and it's subject to all the normal laws of physics.

I have this chinese hub motor earlier. In overal its nice, but at one point I really hate the downside.

I believe the urethane is just too thin to protect the motor from scratches as well as from impact.

Replacing urethane is almost a no go, especially if you like certain brand like orangatang.

The mounting with the little square is great solution compared to gluing with small bolt to retain them. However since the acle is a bolt indtead of one long solid axle,the probability of bending is significantly higher. My hub motor mount always felt abit tilted which create large vibration due to the wheels not spinning properly.

Not saying that hub is not an option, but Id rather have a standard one solid thicker caliber trucks with 12mm solid single axle. Added with the small square to solve torque issue. Thick urethane would be a solid option with 100mm++ wheel size as its more stable and safe for higher speed which we have on an eboard.

This makes more sense.

It looks to me as though the "Staticool System" [blue] slides on and supports the axle.  The actual exposed axle appears to be not much longer than your standard truck.  Therefore I don't think the axle is nearly as unsupported as the screenshot above would indicate

I agree @onloop - it's logical that there's a cantilever effect transfeing loads, on a non hub motor wheel, through the length of the wheel (all that urethane), and in a worse case scenario, ending up at the Green spot in the above (where the outermost bearing of a non hub motor is).

Not how I see it for a hub motor, though - There's a much more direct and linear transfer of the load taken from outer lip straight to the Red spot in the above (where the outermost bearing of a hub motor is). Way less mitigating happening, no?

@PXSS

As an engineer, you might be able to give @Hummie some free technical advice.

**Below is the problem that he is getting so worked up over.**


**PROBLEM**

Determine the correct shaft tolerance for bearing fitment, onto aluminum shaft (or whatever alloy you desire), whilst factoring in thermal expansion of shaft.


**OBJECTIVE**

Design for maximum durability, shaft & bearing lifespan should exceed consumer expectations in normal skateboarding use case.





_I have paid well over $10,000USD dollars to machine/mech engineers for design consultation on this matter, so I am also very interested in your how your findings compare with my own research._

I wouldn't sell a hub motor anywhere there's a mandatory guarantee on products because if someone actually rides a decent amount of time on a slide fitted motor it's likely to be a paperweight before the year is over.This goes for what I sold, Jacobs, raptor2, Carvon, and everything I've ever seen.

It's evidently strong enough for approximately 1000lbs or so of static loading, and a cool marketing video indeed, but to me it's not really a useful test for most of the issues discussed in this thread.

I mean it's a skateboard, not a display stand for trucks right?

The issues so crassly brought up by @Hummie are that of dynamic wear of the assembly which would lead to its failure. I'm not taking sides with any of you, and as I've only been lurking around here for a couple of months I'm still a bit confused if this is a forum for open technical discussion or a marketing platform.

I think time will tell with real world use if this is a hub motor here to stay or just another maketing tool to get people to buy boards. I wish you all the luck.

Onloop shows the joints, bearing and mounting strength lol. That after the weight theres no wiggle, bend or weird vibrations on the raptor.

Well idk. Before raptor2 is out its hard to say anything. What I do know for sure is that for people who just get started with DIY eboard, the price worth it. Everything you can imagine on an eboard its there. I am no mean on sponsoring raptor2, but I was trying to make the same high quality eboard with all the budget i've spent its worth it.

I'm still DIY'er on this side, so buying raptor in not an option for me. The fun is building / assembly the board, not riding it.

It's both a forum for technical discussion and marketing. We can learn how to build our boards and we have a bunch of people selling the parts we need to build them along with some selling pre-build boards. 

Onloop's vid of his truck riding over his board shows an impressive level of strength. Sure, I can do that with regular skate trucks and they won't brake. But it does show that his hub motors are able to hold that kind of weight. The stronger it is, the less prone it is to deforming thus less prone to wear from vibration. It also shows that it won't bend or break if you're 200lbs and go off a curb.

The weight that those hubs and truck can handle is no more then an average longboard in my opinion.
When a bearing gets a little bit free play and you're driving on a bad road, the bearing gets smashed against the hub and the axle, this is what causes damage.
So if there is no clearance between the bearing and the hub, even on high temps, there is almost nothing that can go wrong.
only if the aluminium used is to soft to handle those impacts it can come loose.
On my own hubs the bearings are sliding in with a little bit of force with my hands. 
To secure them i used Loctite to be sure they can not move. 
So if  i get the same problems of loose bearings and such, the aluminium used for the truck isn't hard enough to withstand the impacts.

That's a pretty troll thing to say, quite fucked up and personal don't you think? I don't think @onloop would change his design or do anything you ask, in the vein of the greater good, with accusations and combative rhetoric. 

TBH your theory holds weight, but at this point its a theory and like you said, we need to see evidence of real world testing. I for one haven't seen your prototypes or really researched your new designs either. I just know that your first and second products were quality but still had issues of which you claim to have solved.

Either way, we all know there are a thousand ways to skin a cat, it's best if we all keep pursuing the perfect design and if yours proves to be better, you will reap the rewards. Though i believe that you shouldn't be accusing people of inferior design based on your hypothesis when there isn't any solid evidence to prove your point.

Beyond hub motor durability, both @Hummie and @onloop have leverage issues right here:

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/3/d/3dd37fc2b55daa2fe470bf185ce6fc44343f5e66.jpg" width="690" height="391">

Hummies super wide hub motor snapped an axle because it was through axle truck.

Lucky for Onloop, and his customers, his axle isn't supported enough to snap IMO - it's just going to get wobbly in the hanger over time (as it currently is). Even within this thread a hub motor user eludes to this issue.

There's already Chinese hub motors with Onloops interface out there, but who wants to trust that? Plus Onloops motor is a wider lever than those are. @Hummie has proven wide hub motors will never work on 8mm axles. Larger axles might be fine, but only if they're supported enough. 

Why is there even an axle on a truck with hub motors, aren't you just fixing a non rotating stator to it? ...and therein lies your solution.

Hopefully I'm wrong, and part of the 10K Onloop says he spent with engineers and designers already went towards dismissing what I'm suggesting is a problem.

I hinted above at pretty easy solution, but why solve a problem that doesn't exist?

Good luck with that!

to keep it clear the axle that broke on me was maybe even a bigger lever and I'd have to measure and I had slightly touched it with the dremel getting the aluminum around it off.   And the helpful structure of a "boss" was ruined by using the dremel and changing it from a nice smooth aluminum hanger face against the motor.  I think the "boss" is a great thing and could be useful but I dont think much of that effect or whatever the hell you want to call it, is happening with the ghost.  a boss being a flat surface against another flat on the axle or something and I'll have to look it up.  It's effective in not having the axle bend or break at the junction between those surfaces.
if you had two of these things with the axle bolted between them, them being side by side along the axle, if you try to bend the axle the wall of these parts press against each other and stop the bending. src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/c/4/c4891b635a655c3c868a6342a07666c9ee9fb0ab.jpg" width="666" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/c/4/c4891b635a655c3c868a6342a07666c9ee9fb0ab.jpg" width="666" height="500">

Of course there's nuance to your axle failure, and how some of those specifics contributed. Just keeping comunication simple

In a perfect world with a pristine skate truck with 8mm axles, you're super wide hub motor is going to cause problems IMO. Whether that be a snapped axles, or a bent hanger over time.

On a nice flat surface, the load where the axle and hanger face intersect, is more in shear (think BIG TRUCK tires sitting on a hub motor board) than when debris, a curb, whatever contacts the wheel further out towards the lip.

The square boss does very little IMO. And if you're dead set on axles for hub motors, having more hanger face surface area would make it easier for the aluminum part of the hanger to handle.
 
If wide hub motors and axles are your future, IMO you should be using as close to the full ID of the stator as you can and a one piece axle.

If the root of the tooth isn't of value for further building the field on the end of the tooth it's wasted space and weight. A super thick hollow shaft/axle going to the Id of a largely hollow stator would allow the strength of steel with a great weight reduction and maybe, if there is a magnetic field built in the center of the stator and it isn't of use, removing it would also make the motor more efficient with less iron losses.
In the picture above there isn't any field in the stator just after the very base of the tooth.   maybe it's there only to make production easier and use a standard stator size or something.   It's structurally important but could be replaced in that purpose
And could much more easily give the stator a way to pass off its heat with some ...ice..in the center of the axle or something

Just saying but Jason has got a couple more inches on you. Also I think we might have another Devin on our hands!

Anyways I don't see why everyone doubts Jason so much especially after the truck video. That completely debunked all these disputes. Personally I think Jason has the best hub out by a long shot. I just love how big it is! Carvon v3 hubs are pretty cool also. Hubs are the future guys... My first though on my build was how strange my board felt when coasting. I cant see myself bombing a hill on my skateboard with a belt/chain drive cause of how differently it would feel. It just is not the same.

Putting a truck on a hub motor has nothing to do with the kind of problem that Hummie described at the beginning of this thread. It is not debunking this very specific issue raised here. A static load test does not say anything on the behavior with time, the degradation of the performances, etc ... 
The ceramic tiles on the space shuttle can handle more that 2000K temperature but they can break when you hit it with a small hammer. You can make a super impressive test ... but if the test does not aim at the correct issue, it does not answer the question.

Hummie is making a mountain out of molehill. If you are in the motor manufacturing game and you don't know how to tolerance a shaft for bearing fitment you are in trouble. At worst case scenario, if you have no idea about shaft tolerances and fitment, any experienced machinist should be able to help you achieve a suitable fitment.... 

This is a basic process performed routinely in machine engineering shops in countless different industries across the globe. In fact, these days most modern mills are controlled by software that automates the process.

Of course you can also choose from various materials. Steel & alloys, each have there own advantage and have different thermal properties, weight and cost variables.

The reality is that hub motors are proving to be a very viable option and will most likely be the standard in esk8 in the near future.

What was it? And did they get their million-mile part?

I once watched one of the guys in the motor pool take a brand new, sealed-in-its-box, Humvee tail light assembly, open it up to take one small part out of it, and throw the rest away. They could get all of the tail light assemblies that they wanted, but they could not get any of the smaller parts inside.

It was an exhaust brake.  And yes - they are using an iteration of our design (to the best of my knowledge). Basically they wanted it to last the entire lifetime of the engine, since it was a real PITA to replace when it's buried under layers of armor

Talk about a good investment though.  I think our budget was $5k, yet they got the equivalent of 2 engineer-years worth of work.  Haha, maybe Enertion should sponsor a senior project at an Australian university. I would have loved to work on a project like this during college

The reason this topic turned toxic was because the original poster mixed a little bit of truth with a bunch of marketing rubbish designed to refloat his own business. He has gone from 'glueing hubs to trucks is a great idea' to 'its all bad except my next idea'. 

It was a disgraceful post and I'm really surprised he is being defended just because another business chooses to take on the claims because they are invested in the same space. 

All e-skateboard designs I've seen have pros and cons. The life of each product varies depending on what performance, quality or cost design spec the designer has prioritized. 

If you are shallow enough, you can find an argument against every builders design in this forum. 

For once I don't see enertion attacking potential customers. Not at all. I see someone working harder than a number of competitors. Further, he is addressing far more facets of the business than most (carvon probably being the other exception, except he chose to not engage in this forum with his customers at all). 

Saying hub motors will fail is like saying car engines with fail. No shit. The question is- are you satisfied with the up time. Enertion is actually posting some vids to help people make a semi-informed decision, unlike a bunch of 'all-care no responsibility' contributors to this thread who take offence to being challenged in the real world. 

If this thread was started in an honest and transparent manner, there probably wouldn't be so many pitch forks in action. 

Hummie is reaping the rewards of shitpost of the year.

And just wanted to add it in now, before someone else realizes and calls me on it, even my old maxhinist advisor missed it, my bearing housings and shafts for what I sold have a finish,  hummm.. Chrome then a layer of copper and then finally the steel. No one called me on this and only now did I realize.  
Anyway tooting my own horn, regardless of whether a slide fit steel or maybe even possibly a better aluminum could be capable of standing the abuse for a long enough time.  Maybe 7000 series or similar aluminum on a big surface area would be good. Interference fitted though produces a mechanically silent wheel, no rattle.  That's all it could come down to

Sorry man, I honestly don't think potential customers are retarded. It's that a lot of people in the complete buying world don't have a lot of experience with other boards to compare with. I've said it before in the raptor 2 thread that for the price, it's a steal. But the reality is that a lot of, if not most of, his customers eat it up and believe it. Just look through the threads. It does not make them retarded. When the market is saturated with weak boards, it's likely they've ridden something weak before. And that leads them to believe these marketing claims are more or less true. I could point to at least a dozen members on this forum that seem to fall into this category. I know this because I was one of those people at one point when I didn't know better.

If you look back, I did call bs on evolve. I did attack their product because I knew before hand the claims were bs, based on the battery alone. In the end though, nobodies winning from either side here, so it's really just a waste of time.

eliminating the axle makes a huge amount of sense and I'm very surprised onloop hasn't done this given that he has custom trucks made already.. iYou might as as well go for it at that point and get a nice big boss and thread the motor onto the truck with a good size M6 or M8 and let the interface/boss take the load.

The Trillium motor will be configured this way for anyone who wants it that way. Otherwise, I'm trying to make it work on any truck and have about 20 different trucks I can verify it works on. Getting closer!

I like hollow and am getting a hollow/axle at 20mm done but while it'll be slick and I like the idea for different reasons, one being that it'll be lighter, it's likely to be a less powerful motor as all the aluminum and even the steel surely act as a good heatsink giving a good thermal path. A hollow tube the stator sits on could be cooled through the hollow tube in theory but if it's just relying on air cooling going up a steep hill any sort of air scoops and heat sink inside the tube aren't going to do much.  Ir will be lighter to carry it up!  But I like the idea anyway and want to do it. It's a trade off for safety I think because hollow structures are relying on stiffness and stiffness and toughness seem opposite, with stiff structures shearing and tough yielding and just bending.  We'drather a bent axle than a snapped one of course. a going more hollow is more stiff and more stiff means less tough. I think they're in a way opposites and one will bend and one will snap.    But surely it can be done and done well.  
The heat has to go somewhere and sucking it right from the inside of the stator, what is the best metal for this shaft/axle?  If it's designed by some oldster with 50,000 hours of cad production for 75$ an hour or you bend hollow rods, and now you know how hollow it can be,  will that hollow rod be able to jam enough thin heatsink ribs down it and with an air scoop at the center of the hanger, will it door no point other than just lighter.  Which is something.

I think they probably use a slightly longer bare 8mm axle than standard so as to fit the pulley.  Ive seen other huge spans on hub motors like double the length of whats standard with the final bearing outer edge 23mm from the start.

"Was riding on pro mode at about 15 mph, very lucky to be heading straight and not turning when it happened. If I had been turning or in traffic I could have been seriously hurt. All of a sudden I thought something got caught in the wheels, and started fish tailing immediately pretty bad. Had to run off, it was a bit of an impact but I didn't fall. Returned to see what got caught and lo and behold the right rear wheel has sheared right off. Was riding on sidewalk but no large crack or anything near by. My thoughts are this had been developing for a while. Stay safe, already emailed boosted for a replacement. This was on a V2 dual plus with 300 miles, so pretty surprised. I've put in quite a bit more miles on non powered skateboards and never had this happen."

Are they using caliber clones?  I expect the aluminum outer to be somewhat stiff and brittle, and have a failure just like that, but the inner steel rod should be somewhat ductle and bend rather than snap.  It's why flexy rebar is put into brittle concrete.

It bothers me that such an expensive board isn't using a name brand tried and tested truck, but decided to save a few bucks and get a cheap under-engineered knock-off.

These are what I'd expect in a failure.

I've found interesting review of RAPTOR 2 hub motors.Seems like RAPTOR 2 also has issues with the motors.  Something for @Hummie to look at. 

https://www.electric-skateboard.club/t/raptor-2-the-100km-review-part-1/415


"The problems were focused around the rear wheels. Both the hub motors and the urethane.

The hub motors motors were not running particularly smoothly and they got worse as time went on. They exhibited some clicking noises, particularly at low speed. I contacted Enertion about this and they informed me that they were having some issues with the quality of the motor bearings in some of their earliest motors and have changed their supplier. They immediately sent me out two new motors which arrived 5 days later. I have just installed them and they seem perfect. PROBLEM SOLVED!

The second issue I have is that this urethane skin of the rear wheels is simply too flexible. The urethane is fixed to the hub motor by 10 little hex bolts on the outside edge, but on the inside edge there is nothing fixing the urethane skin it to the motor at all. What this means that when all that centrifugal force turning the motors, the inside edge of the urethane can warp, flare and twist a little on the inside edge. This in turn and creates a gap between the motor and the urethane skin on the inside edge of the wheel and allows dirt and debris to get in between the hub motor and the urethane, resulting in a less than perfect roll. 

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/0/e/0ebbfc9f760f81a7ff7d0a2b2a3d69760e91c1ee.JPG" width="666" height="500">
A picture of the hub motor from the outside with the urethane removed. 10 hex bolts hold the urethane skin in place on the outside edge...

Clearly the urethane of the rear wheels is too flexible and warps pretty noticeably under load. This is clearly a design fault, the inside edge should definitely be rigid.

Note the gunk build-up around the hub motor. This is only after a few days use and happens because of the flexible rear urethane.
GOOD NEWS! This issue is being rectified by Enertion as we speak! They are currently developing and soon to manufacture a new urethane skin for the hub motors. This will be a slightly harder formula but most importantly it will have a rigid inner ring, preventing it from warping. As soon as these are available they will be shipped out to all R2 owners for free. Problem solved!"

i thought so. The second i saw one torn down on my bench i thought that would be a problem. IF that's the only problem though, congrats to jason. He's going to be selling extra thane i'm sure because "thane wears out anyway", i can hear it now. Especially after just having read this entire thread. 

@JohnnyMeduse Didn't i fucking say that? Tell them i said it would do that. I don't care how many beers were involved.  They must twist, and when you slide an older urethane tire off you can see the thane dust falling out where it wore against the textured edge of the motor can. 

I can even imagine a level of compression on the thane, a lateral compression caused by the grip on the road vs the loosening of the thane due to centrifugal forces in conjunction with the lateral forces present when carving hard. On the same thane, the street side would compress toward the outer edge of the wheel while topside the thane would want to follow due to it losing its connection with the motor can, resulting in lost friction between the thane and motor can on a textured motor can creating a cheese grator effect. Not to mention the deformation that occurs diagonally bewtten the street and the top side as the creep from the bottom tries to drag the thane across the top with it. 

But that's not really a problem when you're selling tires too. Business is good!

Im sure you will find the best solution

My guess is maybe the axle is made from a hard steel so the heat change the molecular structure and leave it fragile because is too much high carbon grade, then a cheaper steel (tool steel medium grade carbon) could be a better option, anyway Im not sure, metals are not my strongest area.

Clearly not many, since the raptor 2s started shipping pretty recently. You would hope to expect this to never happen, 100 miles or 5000 miles... Scary stuff.

I don't want to toot my horn, but I warned about this back when I saw the first picture of that truck. 8mm is simply weak, especially super long 8mm like that. You have to go bigger, but then, they need to redesign everything again. Unless they go to a titanium maybe... But thats expensive and a design change would be better for the long term costs.

We have changed a lot to help with long term production costs on hummies hubs. It's constant battle to produce high quality, durable, yet affordable motors. We have conceded to overkills on things like the trucks, because a failure like this surely can mean a serious injury.

removing 18mm of aluminum to use Evolve pulleys made me nervous. This much bare steel is just silly. 

Redesigning the motors for 10 or 12mm axles probably won't happen unless they can just do a bearing swap, and i think there's more to it than that. They may be better off sourcing better steel or other alloy for the axles depending on what's going on with the motors.

Looks like the 8mm axle is threaded, leaving a core of only 6.x mm. Also looks like stainless steel.
If you choose the correct steel alloy, the axle should bend before it brakes, giving you time to realize there is a problem.
Titanium would not resolve the matter BTW! 
10mm is the bare minimum for such long, extended axle shafts, using high grade super tough steel alloys.
Those alloys will always rust and need surface treatment (e.g. phosphate conversion coating). There is no stainless steel available that can take such loads. Phosphated axles are black, just like any skate truck axle you find out there.

[/quote]

Let me explain what they need to do if they want to go up to a thicker axle. I thought they would of learned from hummies mistake over a year ago now. But they went for it anyways.


They need to first change the stator. Needs a bigger center hole, which is going to mean a less space for copper.
That will mean they likely new to figure out a new wind, since if they are doing a full copper fill, it will no longer fit.
Then, they need to change their hub design/the way it mounts onto the truck to fit a 10mm or 12mm axle instead of 8mm. (we call the piece between the truck and stator the hub. The whole thing assembled is a hub motor)
Then they need to change the bearings to fit the larger truck.
Then they need to change their truck design to a 10mm or 12mm truck. (going to cost a fortune. All the old molds are trash basically, could be another 10k or more in mold costs, depending on how many molds they have)
Then, they are going to need to make a change or two to the can, so the new larger bearings fit.
This is going to do a few undesirable things, such as the bolt on the end now will be a 12mm or 10mm bolt, so a skate tool can no longer help you there (minor, but slightly annoying if you want to take the motor apart for any reason)

Basically, they need to go back to the drawing board and start from the ground up again, if they want to fix this problem permanently.

As trampa said, you have to remember they have 6mm really of un-threaded rod, 8mm with the threads. That's really thin, and no matter what material they use, I don't think the problem will go away with out a redesign. And a redesign means a complete haul on the current design. Almost every piece in the motor needs some form of modification.

I hope they do address it by doing this, because axles snapping on you is scary shit.

Believe it or not, I want enertion to fix this. They have a good motor otherwise. We can't possibly fill the demand for hub motors alone, so we need others in the market to help fill the demand.

The question on my mind though, is will they recall all of the boards out with a known design flaw?

We debunked that theory as a gimick. It shows nothing. It's the long wear and tear that causes this. fatigue cracks do to stress over time. Ploping a 4000 lb truck on to a turck like this will not make it istantly fail (although at some weight, it will). This is why I warned you need to test your motors for more than 6 months before shipping them.

It's like pulling the 4000 lb car. It really doesn't show much. There's guys on boosted boards that did the same...

if youre not alive to enjoy your motors anymore then it doesn't matter as we're all selfish fucks.  anyone who was planning to give them to their next of kin I respect that and would honor that warranty. . .  these motors are all just 1020 mildest steel now,  more likely to deform than snap in that but a large tube so maybe more liable to snap in that way. (trust me in that I've looked into it more than just this summation) but  guess what i'm saying is you get what happens to come out of whatever place you bought a hub motor these days and its all an experiment.   even the things I see with big names like mellow they are doing experimental designs.  


 Even excluding the belt and pulleys of a pulley set-up I would argue the motor is more liable to damage from flying stuff or a hard bang especially since it's an outrunner with a bearing only on one side and the bell with magnets is awesome looking but not for smacking into curbs.   

 And assuming they are hobbyking or almost any other motor they will be using very thin multistrand wire this is tacon 160 wire that comes from the teeth all the way out leads vs 16 awg and a much lower kv.  What gauge the tacon is don't trust my tool and fingers to figure out it's exactness, it's thin.  no one...no one does 16 awg and it's not burning out without a huge amperage.  IN a short straight to battery id like to see how long it would last.  <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/4/d/4d3dc7a28124d569cde1caeaa30ea80c9f58ce81.jpg" width="375" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/1/1/11b265dc92d9539ac16e82a15ed7ad58e0f0e0bd.jpg" width="375" height="500">
These are also very rare in their being terminated wye instead of delta.  Why does it mater and kv is kv?. unless the teeth are wound poorly or even windings are skipped, which happens, and the inductance of the two different pathways for the current in the delta termination will have imbalanced voltages, fighting against each other,  I've seen it estimated at up to 3-5 percent loss of efficiency with this delta imbalance that happens.  the two circuits do not produce the same voltage because the winding inductances are not the same perfectly.  wye is one circuit.  and allows much fatter wires.

will the magnets get damaged eventually? I haven't seen it happen yet.

 huge bearings.  we could do hub motor to pulley motor throwing contests.  


tires I'm  looking forward to trying this 75 duro super high rebound stuff this week.   its not as strong but have to see how it feels.  one day soon things will go faster.

My apologies for the lateness of reply, but here's what we know thus far:

One incident related to Moja, our content creator, on a pre-production board extensively used for demo purposes, that had an early version of the shaft. This was well before production boards began shipping, so we used this information in order to modify the materials used in making the shaft to provide it extra strength on production models.

The latest incident did occur on a customer's production board that featured this strengthened axle - and it is important to note that all boards that have been sent out have this axle. Safety of our riders is always a primary concern of ours, and management have spoken extensively to the production team regarding if this warrants a recall or not.

As this is a sole incident out of 130 received boards (representing 0.38% axle failure rate), we believe at this stage that this was an isolated incident, so will not be instigating a worldwide recall.

We are currently working urgently with production to delve deeper into this issue and establish if there is cause for concern for our current Raptor riders. Rest assured that if a redesign is called for, we'll do it, and we'll also ensure that no early adopters are disadvantaged by this process.  Jason will be doing a live update later this week to explain the situation in further detail and to inform you guys about what is happening on the production side of things. 

We know it's been super frustrating to not have any word or update from us in the past few weeks - this has mainly been owing to us being hamstringed by manufacturers, and us rejecting a lot of products that they have sent us that were meant to have been made weeks ago.

As always, we thank you for your patience and understanding while we work things out.

Look at boosted. This is happening to their boards, not just 1 person, and no response from ceo. This happens 1 time to Enertion, we get a response quick and they give us info about further efforts to fix the problem if it persists. 

When you pro-order and kickstart something, kinda a given a few kinks are going to get worked out. That is kinda the deal, cheaper board for dealing with stuff like this. It has up to a 2 year warranty which is amazing for esk8. 

Love what Enertion is doing. Love the modular system, love the transparency, love the product.

This isn't an issue isolated to the R2 (or hubs for that matter) either. Boostedboards have shown multiple occurrences of a similar failure and have been completely silent in response.

What would happen if you went with your problems request to a serious competitor on the top end market of trucks. Trucks that survive many years of daily riding, insane forces during slides, especially in the professional downhill scene.  An other example would be people jumping insane drops, lika actually insane (https://youtu.be/4GFIXrybfKg).

Could be that this can be dismissed, I am no expert nor an engineer, but why try to reinvent something, when others have painfully gathered that information. In years of events, races and within the whole community, I heard of 2 trucks failures in the gravity skate world. Both widely discussed, since at 60mph thats your life. And that is from a lot bigger number of riders, many many more miles, alot more speed and force than put on any raptor truck.(not your typical 20-50$truck, most spend an average of 180-240 for a SINGEL truck, but again, safety is no place to save money ever). Why not work with a company together who specialices in exactly what you are after, a truckt hat is precise, survives almost anything and offers all the ride quality you could wish for.(#smallermargins / #moresafety)?

IMO you can tell a lot about how strong a manufacturer thinks there product is by the maximum weight limits they will guarantee under warranty.

Raptor 2 = 100kg
boosted = 113 kg

As a larger rider (145kg) i haven't found a single hub motor board that is acceptable. If it wont support a user like me then what hope does it have of standing up to long term abuse of a standard user for daily commuting.

If there was a hub motor that would survive a few months of abuse from me then i would say its unlikely to break for any regular user. But i cant see that happening any time soon, even if you can park a 4000lbs truck on top of it.

don't know if you were quoting me with the "everyone else's stuff is trash but the super stuff I have coming that isn't available yet", but fair enough to some degree and I say stuff like that.   I do think every hub motor on the market is subpar, including what i've had made over the last 2 years including maybe 2 grand in parts sitting at home that Im not interested in finishing and bothering to send to people and am content to trash them.  They work fine and  I ride them daily and feel very safe knowing they won't break but I don't care about making a buck and more interested in getting the best design I can made for me and others.

Man, this so so scary. 90% of the time you ride in your comfort zone during downhill runs. You are having fun ennjoying yourself. But then you get those 10% where you know you are on top of your game, the street is perfect, every corner is spotted and you go balls to the wall. I cannot imagine how much confidence I would loose if that would ever happen to me. That's why I trust my trucks with my life (have to) but they better be worth it for the ca. 700$ I dumped into them...

@Hummie . Will be getting a 4wd from you guys, have to try them!! Anyway, if you are sitting on old motors, mayby take a set of your hands as well, wanna try some stuff out on them for science :)

I don't understand how Carvon hub motors work. It is essentially a Gen 2 Koowheel with some modifications so the wheel is mounted on the end of the motor instead of the urethane being wrapped around the motor? Won't this allow for more leverage on the axle/motor connection, causing the motor to break more easily? It also says they machine the diameter of the axle down.... Why doesn't someone do a second bearing support on the outside of the wheel instead of relying on the single connection point at the truck? Or just make the axle insanely thick? Don't all hub motors have hollow axles to allow for the wires to go through? Why not just overkill it with the axle and bearing size?

https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/raptor-2-the-100km-review-part-1/31721/81

 it's too stunning to ignore.  the one guy in san fran i contacted on this site that had a Raptor asking him if he wanted to meet up and do stuff ... he told me he couldnt because his second set was bending after the first had already snapped.  someone will be dead soon.  Ive never heard of a skate product sold that is obviously shown to be so unreliable and dangerous .

After more research I think it happens when the motor isn't able to push the stator the amount needed to get the whole thing going, right? In that case it can overheat since it stays more or less in position and gets no cooling from turning? Please, I spend a lot of time now on this question :D and I came to the conclusion that it must be a really trivial question because there isn't even a single Youtube video about it :smile: @Hummie at least you should know it (in case it isn't trivial at all)...

It happens from standstill in a steep passage or when you loose speed because of steepness. It won't move at all but makes rattling noises. Increasing amps work but only limited (depending of the grade of steepness). 
@Vanarian The hubs I sold you make it up these passages where it happened but the new ones don't. But both will do the rattling when its too steep. I know it can't be good but I just want to know what happens and why :D (Sometimes I'm a 38yrs old child, I know :D)

ive never hit a hill I couldn't go up and don't slow down honestly.  theres some steeper hills around I haven't tried but maybe the motors are too small and they have a limit of 50a based on the amount of steel and it will saturate and cant get anymore torque.   a guess.

Maybe sensor mode only can be choosen but ive heard speed is reduced and possibly efficiency too

Sensors only help with starting, but are much needed. I think that should be a goal for you hummie with the next round of motors. It really does make a night and day difference.

True plus compare all the rest of the work it's really about place the 3 hall sensor and if you want go fancy the temp one as well between the stator. There is also a thread on the forum I think

sensors will make you even fatter..as if you cant push to 1.5mph.  come on luke youre always looking for the too easy way.

If only someone would find some small sensors n put them in these hubs then I’d be inspired to do it. 
We have to hook up to ur trucks and see what happens. I remember must have been years ago now we talked about it and I think I assumed it would be problematic w the axl being torqued but those trucks are looking really nice.

looks small but have you seen how little room I have to work with?  got crazy with trying to make things as tight as possible.   if it wasn't for that pcb being so wide and the sensors would need to fit between the teeth and be thinner   slots are 1.5mm only and the back side literally will be touching the windings sometimes.  the whole pcb (or something) and the sensors would have to fit between the teeth or within the thin area just wider than the windings that's like 2mm thick and a diameter between 45 and 47mm, at least it's 4mm wide between the stator and wall.  so 2mm thick and 4mm wide.  not much room.![9EFA229D-1BF0-441C-85F0-CD852CD002AA|375x500](upload://nvIKVqd4jZp8S9DsdBIjoZ6CLyg.jpeg) 

I cant fit the wye bundle anywhere but in the hole coming out of the motor you can see, so it's tight.   but if you have an idea im all ears these days.  gotta beat luke and the guy who came first in that race next time

You don’t need the PCB, if you make 3 of the stator slots a little wider with a dremel you can fit them there and do all conections directly with wire, no extra space used

I’ve heard of it done like that but was a lot of work and even dremel if the stator seems risky n maybe would be as exact as need be.  If I was to do them for people I’m not going to do that but if maybe a very thin PCs or cast plastic holder fit and I could do it more easily.

_(edited: previously made a mistake converting radians to degrees which resulted in over-estimation of the power requirement)_

@Hummie i wanted predict how efficient 2 of your hubs are at the same constant speed (25mph) on flat ground vs climbing a 5% slope with a rider + vehicle mass of 200 pounds--
results:

25mph constant speed flat ground = **9.70 watt hours per km**
25mph constant speed up 5% (2.86 degree) slope w/ 200lbs - **36.26 watt hours per km**

https://image.ibb.co/f2XK3p/25mph_flat_vs_5pct_slope_2.gif

**25mph** constant speed **flat ground**:
**9.70 watt hours per km**
**5.55a** motor current per motor
390.68w electrical watts (combined)
386.39w mechanical watts (combined)
**4.3w** ohmic heating watts (combined)
98.9% electrical to mechanical efficiency

**25mph** constant speed **up 5% slope w/ 200 pounds**:
**36.26 watt hours per km**
**12.7a** motor current per motor
906.71w electrical watts (combined)
884.18w mechanical watts (combined)
**22.58w** ohmic heating watts (combined)
97.51% electrical to mechanical efficiency

@Riako ...Maytech 9055 vs Hummie V4 comparison part 2....

this chart shows that if we want to compare the Hummie V4 and Maytech 9055 at steady 25mph up a 5% slope.... we can't... because unlike the Hummie V4, the Maytech 9055 doesn't appear to be capable of maintaining 25mph up a 5% slope w/ 46v battery & 200lbs (red line, bottom left chart, vehicle thrust pounds -- 2 motors)... the top speed of the maytech 9055 on a 5% slope w/ 46v battery & 200lbs appears to be about 22-23mph.

Figuring what the continuous sustainable power output is maybe isn’t applicable in the real world as it takes a while just to bring the hanger temp up and soon after the battery is likely to die.   I think high heat failure would likely show as the esc loosing synch and maybe that’s a good benchmark...unless the motor is using low temp magnets or crappy insulation on the windings.  The motors I make use N48SH good to 300f and wire with insulation rates to 200c but I wouldn’t want to go anywhere near those temps and wouldn’t want to base the wattage potential based on them.  It would make sense that these motors could put out a lot more power before failure based on these ingredients but if the heat rises to the point the esc has trouble it won’t matter.  Not that I’ve had esc trouble ever and I’ve geen to 230f but I expect it would happen before 300f and heard of it happening

in this comparison the maytech 9055 is adding 6.1x as many joules of heat per second to the hanger, while both are climbing the same 5% slope with the same 200lb mass at the same 20mph speed...

even if the maytech hanger were 6 times better at dissipating heat than the hummie v4 hanger, it wouldn't change the fact that the hummie v4 would still get ~13.2% longer range if the same battery is used...

consequently, lowering the initial heat production is a far better option in my opinion than improving the heat dissipation, because lowering initial heat production increases the range whereas improving the heat dissipation does not.

Wow it’s hard to tell how steep but pretty awesome looking but they didn’t check motor temps at the end!
I think ur right n want to have as much bare axle in the hub as possible, as long as possible.  I just had one pinned spinning on the lathe n am holding off till I figure it. .  So just cones down to a question of how much thread do u need.  And then math. Or possibly finding good representation already out there.  But I don’t even know the lbs pounds torque I put on it assembling or the motor does.
