What exactly are you looking for?
We even donâ€™t know for which voltage...

@Kingdom421 Give us more info. BMS or balance charger? Voltage? Current? Battery chemistry?

The voltage, your desired charge current and the adapter plug type we need to know as min.

You can use this one for 10s to 12s up to 7,5 amps charge
Meanwell hlg-320h-48b
Is cc-cv, the best thing is no noisy fan.
Also not the cheapest.

@Surfer Yeah, no. That's a LED driver, not a battery charger. It's not designed to charge batteries, and it has no current ramp-down or charge termination. It'll charge your battery all the way to 4.2v/cell at maximum current and continue to trickle charge it indefinitely once it's there. That's a **PERFECT** recipe for a battery fire. Do NOT use that thing to charge your batteries.

You can make your own with a boost converter, spare Lipo and watt meter

Have a look at this one

Is it the same charge plug than you have?

I have that already I'm looking for something portable I can plug it into so o don't have to find an outlet. I guess it's call a power bank.

Please enlighten me, then. How am I wrong? Got a graph of voltage and current over time? I'd love to see one.

@MysticalDork  Cc and cv regime is over-rated.  As long as itâ€™s a regulated current and under the max charge rate itâ€™s good (although the charge rate is also likely conservative n you could probably put more than rated at low soc) 

 These supplies do a constant voltage and the current follows ohms law and the pack voltage. If u graph it itâ€™ll be a constant voltage and the current will be at likely the peak output and then decrease as getting closer to charged. It doesnâ€™t trickle charge 

The led drivers are supposedly more robust but I like the golden knob

Alright, I concede that point. What about charge termination?
```

## \#25 Posted by: Hummie Posted at: 2019-01-31T17:51:20.208Z Reads: 55

```
With charge termination happening at maybe 4.2 and then recharging happening if the cell were to sink to maybe 4.1, and that being a continuous cycle, cell charge termination doesnâ€™t do anything except keep the cell from sitting on a constant 4.2v, where it will suffer most deterioration.  If u were to set a bulk charger to 4.1 and leave it there for years maybe it would fare better as it never has to get to 4.2.  If u did set the bulk supply to 4.2 the cell will sit there constantly and not go over, but not nice to the cell to sit so high
```

```
You can choose the voltage termination, it has 2 pot to adjust current and voltage.
Anyway your point was good because not all led drivers are the same, with meanwell the appropriate for our use is HLG series.

Thanks @hummie, I couldn't explain as good as you :)
