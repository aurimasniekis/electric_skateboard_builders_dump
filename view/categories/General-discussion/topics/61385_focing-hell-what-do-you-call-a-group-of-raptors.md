This is what one of the floors at Street Wing HQ currently looks like:

![raptors|690x283](upload://5esLVvDsP0eIyFXeOF55W1m9Tdo.jpg)
 which leads me to the question - what is the correct term for a group of Raptors?
Is it a flock of Raptors? Possibly a Murder?

A murder is for crows I believe. A "Drive by" would be cool. There aren't many group nouns for dinosaurs in general and none specifically of the velociraptor sooo... make one up?

I believe the correct term would be clusterFOC. As in "I found myself surrounded by a clusterFOC of Raptors."

A raptor is a bird of prey like a falcon. The plural is just raptors.
