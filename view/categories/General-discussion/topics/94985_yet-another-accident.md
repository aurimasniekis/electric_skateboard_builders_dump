Well if breaking my jaw 2 years ago wasen't bad enough, here we are again lol

Was riding around the neighborhood when all of a sudden a car that looked like it was parked peeled out to do a u turn. 

I slammed on my brakes but wasen't fast enough to avoid the collision. I practically flew over his hood and hit another parked car with my body.

Result is scrapped knee and dislocated shoulder. Wearing my helmet probably saved me from a concussion as my head did hit the car. 

Stay safe out there fellas. I am done riding for good. I can't keep putting myself at risk like this.

Seriously let your shoulder rest for some time and keep up with treatment of it. Once it dislocates once, the muscles are never the same and more prone to dislocating, and it increases at a near exponential rate. As someone with Ehlers Danlos, shit sucks. If this it your first time dislocating, you need to let it heal as much as it can before you really use it again.

jeez that sounds bad!

I'm even more scared of a big crash now. I had an annoying neck shoulder and upper arm pain for over a week. I went to my wife's chiropractor, they got an x-ray of my neck before they did any work on it. Turns out be slipped discs/"pinched nerves". Can't even imagine what a crash would do to me. If you see a guy riding around in a neck brace, it's me

I am the worst at wearing helmets (as in I have like once even though I own several). I think it stems from my biker bar Harley riding Dad that would always answer helmets were for pussies which I can admit none of the other riders were wearing helmets. One night a drunk driver tried to back down a freeway entrance. Hit my Dad and his best friend died in is arms.......still rides obsessively, still not wearing a helmet. Not an idiot but he‚Äôs part of a group and....

But our gang is all for safety so lately posts like this have been sticking with me. Not to mention the evolve bmx track event where I whiplashed my required full helmet into the ground damn near knocking me out. I need more than just a nice helmet and knee/elbow pads. My first thought is how the hell are you staying cool enough to sport a full @Deckoz setup?

I have bilateral thoracic outlet syndrome... Very severely. A crazy crash straight to the shoulder might actually fix my problem :P

I broke my collarbone about 6 months ago but I got back on and I am slowly getting my confidence back.   Now whenever I hit a rock or a bump or hit speed over 20mph I get flash backs.   Pls recover and keep riding.

i feel you on that.![hand|375x500](upload://4f6rOHFttXLgdbM8fT7zYLSiB1h.jpeg)  i have 3 boards and am building my 4th. went  to dinner the other night and wasnt planning on doing anything fancy so left my body armor at home. i now have 3  four inch titanium pins sticking through multiple bones in my right hand. Even with insurance, i am out over 3k so far not to mention 1 handed for over 2 months now and counting. Worst part is, i was stupid and didnt wear protection, all my fault. as a multi degree electronics engineer, my hands are my living ...PLEASE REMEMBER TO WEAR SAFETY GEAR EVERY TIME YOU RIDE!!! If you see someone without, show them this... :slight_smile:

hope you heal up quick dude.  I think I'm going to start carrying either my knife with a carbide window breaker or leathermen so I can slam the car that causes me to go flying so they have some damage for causing me damage.

After my third fall, I said fuck it and got 6" penumatics with drop down deck. I am 900kms in and haven't had the slightest problem.

I would be furious and bit scared after every fall. It passes. @Boardnamics, get better and slowly get back. Ride slow(<15mph) whenever there is a car nearby. If you have access to a isolated bike lane, they are the best.

Falling is pretty normal for me, I‚Äôve fell hundreds of times since I started riding. Hasn‚Äôt stopped me from riding urethane as I‚Äôve been riding for 6 years back to my pushing days.

We love a dangerous and potentially deadly pastime here chaps and chapesses.  Lets not keep posting about injuries.  Post about your great rides, about the freedom you feel when riding.  Be like the 2nd world war fighter pilots.  No casual talk of the ones who fall, but accolades for the experience when you don't.

Sorry to hear about the wipeout @Boardnamics get well soon man. 

From my experience riding this beast for about 2 years most acidents happen from stupid pedestrians walking with thier eyes closed and drivers i dunno probably medetating while driving or something . So just be careful out there , u might not be an idiot but alot of others are ;).

Get well soon man and stay safe es8ters :)
