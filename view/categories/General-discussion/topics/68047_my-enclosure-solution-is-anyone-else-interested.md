So it's been a while since I had finally come up with a solution for my electronics enclosure that would suit all my needs. :slight_smile: 
[Here](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/my-final-enclosure-solution/45476) is the original post I did about it when it was brand new on the board.

I didn't know it then, but I know now. The material is very high quality industrial grade fibreglass netting with a silicon layer, which gives it it's water, dirt and what not repellent properties.

![IMG_20180914_132657|375x500](upload://iN10RPe7Mtlr5d3BIHQRClVdEDD.jpg). 
The Black side of the Material has the silicon layer and the white one does not.

Yesterday I had to open it up, because I forgot to make a VESC Connection available through the cover and I needed to change some settings. When I opened it up I was actually quite surprised. Here is why:
It's been a few month now with this enclosure. Add first I was very carefull, because I didnt know how it would put up with wet roads, dust, stones flying arround and such.
The truth is I wasnt really careful for a long time. I started to drive in nasty weather situations with wet and dirty roads (sometimes during the rain).
So yesterday when I opened it up there was simply nothing at all. No dust. No residue. No signs that water had come in.
Here is how it looks like after all this use:

Just like it did when it was brand new on the board.The way I mounted it could be improved though. I got some ideas there.

I understand this solution might not be for everyone. But for me as a beginner it was perfect. You adjust it easily into whatever size you need. It's flexible and thin. You don't have to worry about what the ultimate height of your batteries with cables is going to be and so on.
And making an enclosure from scratch by myself was not an option for me either really.
Of course its a soft and thin cover that lies close to your components, but to this day it does not have any scratches or signs that would suggest something touched the cover other than dirt and water. Also a box might get scratched way easier. 
If the material is strapped tightly enough over the components with a little space in between it will keep your electronics very safe. But in the end that depends on the way it's mounted and ultimately on how and where you drive :smile: .
For me the **biggest selling point** though was that I was able to keep the flex in my board without worrying about the enclosure breaking or having to split up my electronics in two sections.

So I was wondering if anyone would be interested in trying this out or if anyone could use some of the material. I have already sent @dg798 a piece and he seemed to be very happy about it.

Just make it clear. I am not looking to make profits here. dg798 simply just had to pay for shipping and thats it. I had this material lying arround and didnt know what to do with it, but since its also the perfect cover for keeping wood dry outside, I got more recently . I have not done the math yet as to how much it would be per m^2, but not expensive at all. So if you guys are interested just let me know below and we will see.
Ultimately this forum has done a lot for me and I would like to give something back!

That's a cool idea! Unfortunately my battery isn't flexy at all :/

Considering people are using velcro bands to store massive lipo's under the deck with no covering I think your solution is excellent. Not my style but plus one for thinking outside the box (literally).

What a great concept.  The obvious downside would be impact damage but still novel idea.

I probably won't use this under my boards. But for a top mount eMTB this might be better than a box in between your legs.

@dareno True, but that always depends on how and where you ride. I have never been in any situation with my board where that would have been a problem. It's true though I could imagine scenarios where that could turn out to be a problem. I am currently thinking about how to fortify it, without compromising the flexibilty. I got some ideas there

I mean blunt force vs acute pressure

Like if I ride off a sidewalk and the part of the enclosure that holds my vescs hits a rock on the ground, would it take the damage sort of like a fiberglass enclosure? Or would it just" transfer all energy " to the vesc

Pardon my phrase choice, I'm not the best with physics :p

The easiest way around that to give you some piece of mind would be to sandwich a .5 inch thick foam mat between two layers of this stuff. So pebbles and the like shouldn't cause any issue. It's a soft sack.

it's pretty strapped down though. So its more like a strong leather belt strapped tightly arround the electronics, with a little space inbetween.

This is a great idea.  What could be done now is to build a removable “shell” over this that you wouldn’t have to worry about waterproofing or even sealing at all.  Hoyt (new company) does a bamboo shell like this:

https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0077/0673/8747/products/Jupiter_bottom_small_900x.jpg?v=1534346973

This would also “beautify” this.  I can see a pretty amazing enclosure for Loaded Vanguards and other flexy decks with a nice shell to make it look clean and protected.

Well you could be more creative about mounting it, or create like 2-3 different shells they would move independently of each other.

This is where I’m no good, lol.  I’m sure someone here can come up with a badass method.  Like an amadillo shell or something like that.

Even a nice box that you wouldn’t have to worry about weatherproofing to go over this.

What a good idea!  see this is what its all about.  The flex is intact.  Attach the components to the deck with a velcro type solution, use a soft inner layer and this material for the security.  @thiswasandy and the shell covering is inspired.  Love this forum for free thinking.  This is how simple ideas become the norm.  Vibration is the main killer of esk8's and you lot may have just hit on a great solution.   work it baby work it!

Ok guys I have made some progress. I get the material with a width of 1.7m. Length can be varied. It would be great if we could all agree on one or two uniform sizes so I don't have to cut each an everyone of you guys an individual piece. I can imagine 1.7m in width is quite big for you guys so what about if we take half (0.85) or a third (0.56). And for the length maybe 30 or 40 inches? Just tell me what you would prefer. And calculate a little bit more material then you would actually need so you can do the very precise cutting yourself.
I'm gonna be honest with you guys. I personally pay for the material 7€ only per 1.7m^2, which is about 8.2$ US. I'm gonna make it simple any size below 1.7m^2 is gonna be just 7€ or 8$. Since I have to go get it and cut it up and put it up for shipping it's just fair I think. Also safes me the trouble of calculating each price individually and I think its not gonna bust anyones wallet either :smiley:.
Shipping to the US is going to be within 10,15 or 19€ depending on the package size. Within europe is a lot cheaper.

This Idea sounds pretty amazing, if we manage to keep the flex somehow. I'm sure that would totally be possible. 
The material I presented here is already waterproof. I once poored lots of water on it under the sink. Wasn't a problem at all. I'm sure it would be possible to make a great combination out of these two products. 
I find the idea of mounting the electronics with velcro and then putting a layer of this material over them very nice. And then just like @dareno said a shell over it. An Armadillo inspired shell  :D 
I was thinking curved little plates with a bendable connector would probably be enough. More like a few connected knee protectors adjusted to fit more or less arround the electronics. 
I think it does not even have to cover the whole bottom area to achieve good impact proofing. Just like the plstic plates on a back protector.

But it's definitly worth a shot

Hey all, long time lurker, first time poster here - hard not to get hopeless gear-lust while lost down the rabbit hole of this place (in the best possible way :) ).

I've come across protective foam with plastic backed and aluminium backed versions - specifically for impact protection, can't remember what they were for (maybe custom motorbike gear?), but thinking that having this stuff under this cloth would provide solid protection, and very easy to work with. Both were flexible, plastic obv moreso.

i have thought a little bit about this armadilo concept. One way would be to rivet smaller and maybe overlapping hard sections to the fiber. The other way could be to only use the flexible fiber inbetween hard section to provide the needed flex. 
What do you guys think would work better.
