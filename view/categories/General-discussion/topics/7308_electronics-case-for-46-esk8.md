As title says.  Any suggestions?  I have been toying with the idea of sculpting spray foam insulation for it's ability to maintain flex.  Then add 1/8" ABS plastic as the covers.  Maybe rough up the bottom of the board and spray right on or add anchors to board and spray over like in concrete.  Anyway, thoughts, ideas?

There are a couple merchants that sell enclosures for esk8.

I can vouch for the Enertion one and find it almost perfect! You can also try your hand at vacuum forming ABS.
