If this is in the wrong place pls move it. I’ve wired in the above switch however I have as an option the side that goes to the load can be unplugged. However I need somewhere to plug it back in when not in use. Is it ok for it to go to the positive wire that is also connected to its other terminal? See below diagram![image|690x406](upload://m0NBG32OeXegg61nZaioHAjNvBW.jpeg)

I don't think anyone quite follows, you'll have to be more specific. Are you talking about bypassing the electronic switch?

Yes. Whilst the lights are unplugged

Honestly, none of this makes sense.

How about you explain your overall goal (what you want to turn on and off and how. Not specific to this circuit, just in general) and we can help explain what the right way to do that is

Ive just hard wired the lights to the board so it’s no longer an issue.
