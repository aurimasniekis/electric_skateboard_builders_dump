On a mountain board. My wheel nut tightened down so hard during a ride that it crushed my bearings. Anyone ever had that happen? Is it from breaking?

Pictures of your setup of bearings and spacers on the axle without the wheel.. like this will help determine your issue

What exactly does "crush" mean? The axle nut's force should go from the nut to speed rings to spacers to the hanger are you missing those?

It sounds like the nut is far to tight or that speed rings were not used.

Jumping in here as I am looking for a source for 12mm speed rings. Would appreciate any suggestions.... Mikenoplois living in Golden Valley and hooked up with Scoo_B_Sk8 however he is in recovery from a recent fall on his board.

Most MBS setups don't use spacers, iddly enough. I actually called MBS once to ask about it and they said it wasn't needed. To tighten the nut until the axle was flush and no more.

Lol... Uh huh. There's no way I'd do that lol... That's just crazy talk. I'm surprised they would say that... But I've never interacted with them or purchased thier hub/trucks.

Yeah, I thought it was weird too. But I've been getting some weird behavior out if MBS lately. Anyways, use spacers no matter what anyone tells you ðŸ˜€.

Bearings crushed inside wheel. Just 2 bearings and the wheel with nut. I have no other parts. 

Thanks all for responding.

I have never used MBS so, but.

You should have a speed ring, the bearing, a spacer, the second bearing, the second speed ring, the nut.
The speed rings help stop everything binding, but importantly the speed ring-bearing-spacer assembly as a whole means there is no lateral load on the bearings as all force is only applied to the inner race and it is supported.
Read the above looking at Deckoz picture, he has some extra stuff in his pic but you should be able to wrap your head around what you need.

Where do I buy speed rings? Should they be on all 4 wheels?

I think they are 9.5mm. You need a spacer between the beatings and a speed rings on both sides if the wheel on all 4 wheels.

So. What exactly is a speed ring? Is it another bearing?  Where do I get them?

this second pic uses different names, the spacers are the speed rings, the sleeve is the spacer...

Hm.. I am running MBS Matrix II trucks and hubs, they didn't come with speed rings or spacers.

The axle is larger than a regular truck so regular spacers and speed rings won't fit.

They're wrong.

Bearings need spacers, especially if you're getting side loads torquing the bearings like a big tall 8" MBS wheel certainly will.

You probably talked to a Grom who 's just there to answer the phone or something.
Either that or they have some dumb business reason why they don't want to do spacers and are trying to push that as acceptable.

Insane that a company selling $600 completes wouldn't be using bearing spacers.

go to Aluminumspacers.com
You should be able to find a the size of spacer you need there.

Tip: I use the thick wall spacers and they work much better than thin wall.

Anyone know what size spacers to run on MBS hubs? Not sure how to measure it since it's an internal measurement

Get a bunch of washers and stack them between the bearings then take them out and measure them with caliper or a mic. 
Start with too many and remove them one by one until they allow the bearings to seat fully.

You didn't just happen to have your wheels off your bearing setup?

It's really nice that you take good pics of things people ask, I know a lot of work goes into that so yeah Cool dude thanks for being helpful.

I actually had a picture saved from doing the Fatboy 3:1 installation write up. It sufficed for the purpose :)

I'm sure the Rockstar have the same width as superstars

Could probably just order a Trampa axle refresh kit...

If you have a caliper just measure between the outer races of the bearings, hold something against the bottom bearing, then subtract the width of the bearings and voila, that's your length of the spacer.

![20180601_143410|690x388](upload://x3xsdkLL8DEj1xuhzFynozmHXR9.jpg)

I have a question for spacer experts, on my trampa hubs there are shorter spacers (16.5mm) with 2mm rubber o-rings between the bearings. Then I filed down custom spacers (about 17.5mm) so I could crank down the axle nut with free spinning bearings and rattle-free. But I think this was not good for the bearings, they sound awful and crushed now after a short time, need to replace them.

So my question is, is it better to have a tiny gap between spacer and inner races of the bearing? It seemed the tight fit is a bearing killer at least in my case.

Hey Rich, are the bearings seated all the way? So when you move the hub you don't hear the outer races clanking back and forth? If you have any play from the outer race not fully seated on both sides they may clank...

Yes they are seated all the way, bearings and spacer are like one unity, absolutely no play at all, but some wheels still wiggle because the bearings have play inside the spokes :rofl: I'm thinking about using o-rings again because I can't fix the rattling anyway.

You need to seat the bearings in the "spokes" so they have no play. This could be part of your cause Bro :thinking:
You can use glue/loctite, I cowboy'd my superstars up with some plumbers teflon tape to make them friction fit.
Another solution might be to use C3 bearings, but that is just a guess...
