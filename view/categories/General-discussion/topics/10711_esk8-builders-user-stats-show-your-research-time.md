I hope there''s a not a similar topic as this one.. There seems to be polls on how many times a day you check the forum and from what device but I thought it would be interesting to compare the read / post time.

So here are my stats:

Dont know how the timer is set (for counting read time, although 125 days translate to around 4 months, which is quite correct for the overall time spent here.

Bump! I think this was a nice idea to post stats.. but it just missed some sort of ''progress'' or ending to this :slight_smile:

Perhaps - who can tell that he is on the forum since its beginning?

I know ''Onloop'' could definately apply for this one.. as he was the one who made this forum!

Hah I think you are really one of the ''longest'' members. Nobody on this thread has beaten you, yet! :D

Though @willpark16 is / was somewhat close with 370 days vs yours of 420 (when posted)

Days should be updated by now probably but it still seems that you might have started when the @onloop created this forum.. was it so?

Oh ok I see.. so are you ''really'' one of the youngest esk8? haha?

Btw, here is a ''sneak peek'' of onloop's stats:

[Edit] Oh well.. now I see that both of your ''days visited'' does not differ much! :D 
So that confirms you were here already quite a while back! :)

Good for u.. at least somewhat productive side time use..

I wish I had some more computer time when at work..

Mostly it has to be just browsing, due to forum access from phone and troublesome quick writing or image editing / upload hassle, which is a lot harder to do on phone than on pc :/
