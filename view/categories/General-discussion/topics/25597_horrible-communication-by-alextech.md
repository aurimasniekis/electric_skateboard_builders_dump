On June 1st I paid @Alextech $160 through his AA torque systems paypal for a 6374 motor, motor mount, and a pulley system. I sent him my information through text and he said that he would send me tracking information and  it would be shipped by the end of last week so June 8,9. 
On June 8th I texted him if there were any updates on the package and he told me that he's been busy and that he would check his interns for shipping. Understandable.
I didnt't get a reply so i texted him on June 10th, no reply...
Texted him again on the 12th and got a reply saying that he'll find the tracking for me. 

Since then he hasn't responded to any of my texts and I haven't received any package yet.

Has anyone had any experience with @Alextech? Is he legit? I'm giving it until Monday and if I don't hear anything from him then I might call my bank to issue a dispute.

If you want to file a claim, you should contact Paypal first and file it through them. If you go straight to your bank first, Paypal will be angry.

@treenutter  @mccloed still hasn't received his promised refund either.

I vote for no more business related posts by @alextech until he can square up with everyone.

In fact here's a good spot to add your name to a list if you are owed product or money. 
The names will be deleted as they are provided refunds or proper tracking info.

1. @mccloed
2. @sukurity

4. @willpark16
5. @Wubbalubbadubdub
7. @Sander
8. localredhead
9. @MakeStuff

Unfortunately I don't spend as much time as I do on the forms as I used too so my apologies from there. 

To clear the water with @sukurity I was hit by a car while enjoying my esk8 Tuesday afternoon around 4. I backed out and even the more marrier had no ID on me so the hospital had a wonderful time identify me. Regardless of the fact that's on me. I have gotten back in contact with him. 

@mccloed I do owe you a refund send me a text to get that squared away with you since I can't find our messages here. 
My # is on my website www.aatorquesystems.com 

@treenutter I sold you something? Please do get in contact with me if so! 

  I just stopped using this platform because it's has been super buggy for me for whatever reason. 

But like @psychotiller said, please do get in contact with me via cell, instead of creating a post about it, makes for much cleaner communication.

Here's the deal. You use this forum with ease every time you have something to sell. People respond, you respond back and take their money.

Then you disappear. It's like the forum only works well for you when you're collecting money.
Just like now. It only took a moment for you to respond to my post. So we know it's working just fine.
Do everyone a solid and just take care of your loose ends. Right now while the forum is working. You have their info. Now's the time to handle it. On the forum.

I payed @Alextech 190$ on May 15 for a spotwelder and VESC. Still has not been shipped, even though I needed the items before June 7. Communication has been spotty. Sometimes there's a response, sometimes I have to send a few messages to get his attention. Not the end of the world though, he offered to throw in an on/off switch as compensation. I will update as this pans out - I'm pretty open minded with this thing in general as vendors pull some pretty long hours and work hard. Patience for me runs out at about 5 weeks so I hope it will be sent soon. Either way as a fellow human being I wish him a quick recovery from the car accident as business does not wait for the unfortunate.

Cleaner communication? How many times has @mccloed contacted you? Just go to paypal, click on your summary, click on their name and refund the amount they sent you. Or explain why you don't have the money. Believe me I personally understand that things happen.

All in all though, If you use the forum to make/take money, it should also be able to be used to keep things honest.

Truely sorry to hear of anyone getting hurt in anyway from esk8ing. I'm hopeful for a speedy recovery.
I had some issues with communication as well. It all ended up with the original sale post being deleted because I inquired and voiced my concerns in the public forum after no response from PM. Shortly after I was contacted via pm by another member with a warning of the same issue. It was too late by then. Admittedly I sent money as friends and family and couldn't afford to lose the money. In the end after much discussion I received my batteries. There are no refunds for friends and family purchases because they are gifts. IMO it's best to pay any seller the 3% and PayPal will protect your purchase.

And that's why we're here. Out in the open. Friends and family should never even be suggested. Either eat the 3% fee or price your things accordingly. I actually do consider all of you family haha, That said, Family's air their grievances in the open too. No accountability otherwise right?

@alextech I didn't buy anything from you. @psychotiller tagged me because we've had some complaints about your group buys and it initiated a discussion amongst the mods about how we handle group buys that don't deliver. Generally we discourage order-resolution happening on the public forum. However, group buys have always been the exception because they start here. So there's a grey area in how we all agree to handle problems with group buys.

@sukurity would it be fair to move this discussion to the original group-buy thread? Just tell me which thread your problem is related to and we can move this discussion there.

@Alextech would you agree that it is fair to resolve all of these outstanding problems before you initiate any additional group buys on the forum?

@psychotiller Cleaner as in faster, more efficient for me. I usually want to make sure I send the refund to the buyer as efficiently as possible, wether it's though PayPal or Western Union for a faster Cash Out. Just trying to make it so I don't waste anymore of there time. @mccloed I can't find the transaction in my PayPal log hence no refund, that's my fault entirely and that's due for me making stupid mistakes. Im Learning to be a better seller slowly but making progress. Your also dead right about being honest, I'm still making mistakes and learning along the way, im working around my issues as I grow and in a sense glad these issues are getting addressed with me now rather than later. 

@treenutter You can bet that im already getting in contact with those who I have issues with and working to resolve then as soon as possible. In total agreement that these issues be resolved before anything else before anymore sales are done on my end.

Well since everyone else is chiming in, i'll leave my experience here that I posted on another forum..I'm sure Alex will report my post but here it goes....

Be careful! And I'm not even trying to be a di** about this. I took the chance and ordered this back in March...fast forward to June and I still had no board. The guy (teenager in high school) was really nice and I can tell he's a good kid, but he just doesn't understand proper communication with customers. I paid him $630 for the Mach 1, everything was going great at first but as each week went by, communication and status updates became less frequent and I felt like a lot of explanations were in fact white lies since he was probably waiting on parts to arrive (originally told it would be a 2 week turnaround). But even after all of this, I'm not knocking the kid as I do believe he has something good going for him...just make sure that you realize that you most likely won't get anything for a few months. I only know one other person on Electric Skateboard Forum that actually has one---he had a list of problems but "AA Torque Systems" actually stepped up and helped the guy out with a few things. Lastly, when I asked for a refund on multiple occasions, he went completely ghost...thank god for Paypal claims!

A few things I forgot to mention. For one, I originally went with this board because I wanted a DIY board but didn't have the patience or tools to do so (I didn't want to deal with a bunch of trial and error). A board like this would have allowed me to customize and repair as necessary since parts are pretty easy to get...and for $630 with those specs...why not! Secondly, the Mach 1 pictured is not the same deck you'll actually get..he sent me a pic of the new deck that didn't have clearance issues like the one pictured. I wasn't a fan but it still seemed like a solid product. So I get why you're tempted as I was just there but I think you should seriously think about it before sending money. I just got me a V1 boosted board for $800...and when you think about the difference between $630 and $800..it almost makes no logical sense to take such a huge risk with a DIY board (at least one that you didn't build yourself). Hope this helps and feel free to PM any questions about the entire ordeal.

Hate to say it buy you have to get Paypal involved. They handled my case within a week. Same story..received a tracking number but never shipped. I'm sure he has a negative balance on his Paypal account now and is on the verge of having his account shut down from Paypal.

@psychotiller thanks for bringing light to this issue, I have been been unable to get the product I paid for or a refund from @Alextech for three months now. So add my name to the sad list here.   Mods please keep this thread open, it clearly a systemic issue at this point and should be highlighted to the forum community until resolved so that others do not get in same situation meantime.  Perhaps a topic for the Lounge.

I'll say this again..I think you all need to file PayPal claims and then escalate it if you seriously want your money back. He already has a ding against his account with my case. Paypal specifically told me that they will look to shut down accounts with too many claims. Been there and done that with Alex and I'm pretty certain he's not giving you any money back if he can help it (Paypal told me that he didn't have my funds is his Paypal account). I tried giving him the benefit of the doubt too, because I still felt like he was not intentionally being a "scammer"...just a case of biting off way more than he can chew. 

I see common behaviors based on everyone's complaints. Poor communication after receiving funds, frequent excuses, and broken promises. Stop holding out guys, you've all given him far too many chances.

There's very little honest feedback in here regarding suppliers.  In fact, there are several very unreliable and unscrupulous vendors in here
[/quote]

This is 100% I bit way to much then i could chew and had to order parts based on the word of manufactures, due to me being new at this its very easily seen that it has proved to have backfired at me. @eddiekphoto Part of the reason you board wasn't delivered to you was because of the remotes, then speed controllers we got were unreliable and faulty. unfortunately during that time i had to deal with personal matters and failed to relay that information to you. Im sorry for that, and you can bet i have made improvements so this doesn't happen.

I bought a Nano Remote v2 from @AlexTech and at first the communication was great and I had no problems paying for remote without thinking twice. Then communication stopped for a while but I did hear from him during the last weekend and he clearly explained reasons and current situation. He said he would ship this week and today I got the tracking number. So in my experience, other than the few week comm blackout (which was reasonably explained), I have had a good experience buying from @AlexTech so far. Just posting here because many of us are quick to post when experiences are bad but not so much about good ones :)

Okay @Alextech.... you take the time to finally respond to me now after all of the failed attempts last month now that you're put on blast. Interesting. The last excuse you gave me was that you couldn't find a suitable box to ship my board in so no reason to make up lies now in front of everyone. How about you focus on getting parts out or refunding the other members on this thread. Im not out to get you in any way but im also not going to hold back my experience when other people are having similar issues. I truly hope that you're able to resolve all of these issues and not be labeled a scammer. Your responses to me are not helping your case...

@caustin Discussions about group buys, whether they are going great, or failing, are allowed on the forum. Since group buys start here publicly, challenges and disputes can be made publicly. Ideally the issues would be hashed out in the original group buy thread  but obviously the problems with this one are major, and warrant a unique thread.

Good point. I guess everyone starts somewhere in any business. Hopefully he learns a valuable lesson and makes better business decisions later in life. :) Def, not trying to stone the guy but dang looks like the list is growing of bad service. Best of luck to everyone.

Ok. Jan I paid him $799 for the "Mach 1 Elite". After requesting a refund in March I finally received the board a couple weeks later. Problem is, 1 of the 2 VESCs didn't work, and the board and enclosure were both visibly cracked up. He told me I could ride it with one hub motor... so I did and promptly burned out that motor. Another month went by before he sent a replacement VESC. On the test run one of the VESCs burned out, along with another one of the hub motors. 

  I filed a claim with PayPal. Alex begged me to take it down and he would send a replacement setup with one satellite motor setup and refund me the difference of the regular mach 1 vs elite. He did send the replacement satellite setup and it worked great.. Until the deck cracked in half a couple days after I got it running. I knew this would happen and had another deck on order. 

Finally got everything up and running but never received a replacement enclosure, a refund for the deck (or a replacement deck) or the refund of the difference which he promised he would do. I told him early June that if he didn't provide the refund as promised by 1 July that I would put the working parts from the first build up for sale on the forum (2x working VESCs, 1x working hub motor, and 1x set of caliber clone trucks). He kept asking for these parts back. The way I see it, the parts are worth more than the refund, so I'm just going to sell them and put the cost toward a VESC 6.0.

I don't think this guy means to rip people off... But he makes a lot of promises he can't/won't keep and can't do QC for crap. He also lies A LOT about shipping dates. More than once he told me the shipped something... I would ask him for a tracking number and he would send it to me days later; the number reflected a ship date of that day and not the date originally stated.

In a way, I'm glad his product has been so screwed up because it forced me to learn more about esk8 electronics and now I feel like I'm almost ready to make my own original build. But yeah... Can't recommend him to anyone.

With all that said, anyone need a working VESC or two? Caliber clone trucks with one working hub? Lol.

I don't know dude. PayPal couldn't help me because I opened and closed a claim once already and now I can't open a new one or reopen the old one. I originally paid for the board on Jan. Even if I got a working board in April it was already too late to start a new claim. You could ask for a refund... Report him to the BBB?

add me on the list... 
I have paid him $685 for dual hubs and custom 12s4p...
Refund not possible because it was transfer for goods or family, I have tried.

Well here is my experience, I have the most of the conversation/messages:

I have ordered dual hubs motors and custom 12s4p pack from the guy @Alextech on the ESK8 fourm:

Jan 28 Me:
So are you selling the EMF trucks?
------

Alextech:
No longer called EMF Hubs but the Mach 1 Hubs! Haha
Long story short they are the same electrical composition but they have a redesigned can that better handles heat and urethane slippage!
Yes I sell the Hubs along with the Vesc's
------

Alextech:
Oh sorry read this to fast, your looking for just the trucks?
------

Me:
I dont need the vesc I only need the motors with the trucks ￼
So can I get some specs of it example:
Max ampere, voltage, top speed, recommended setup & price
------

Alextech:
max battery amp cont. Is 40a  Voltage: Tested up to 50.4v (No Problem)  Top speed: 28mph on 67KV
Recommend set up. 10s4p (Can pull it's of amps)  12s3p (Higher top speed)
Price on just hubs would be $245 Shipped on the Hubs and 2x extra Urethane (86a)

-----

*Discussing colours for the wheels on the hubs*
 ------

Me:
Blue then. Its Midnight Blue right? And the truck silver if possible.
Okey, I want the dual hub motor with the midnight blue color and silver truck.
And how is the braking on those?
So where do I order? ￼
-----

Alextech:
It is midnight blue! Lol
Silver trucks by default ￼
My website is not up yet for parts order but just go ahead and pay 245USD +3% to Aatorquesystems@gmail.com
-------

*Discussing about how strong the brake is, and what to pay*
 ----

Alextech:
So payment will 295. That's priority Shipping from states to Norway. I will ship after February 9th that's when I get the new Hubs!
-------

Me:
Done, I have ordered it!
------

Alextech:
Okay cool! I'll shall put your order along with my shipment for the 5th! I'll keep in touch. ￼
---

Feb 4 Alextech:
Tomorrow the parts get ordered, (Due to Chinese New Year), then 2 days later it get programmed to me, then Shipment YAY! the would shipped by 8th of February.
-----


Feb 10 On Mail Me:
How far in progress have you come, may I ask?
With the hub motors.

Thanks, Sander.
 --------

Alex: 
Hey Zander, Quick update. The factory I get my motors from told me that there was a QC issue when making them motors and it's going to be a week delay till I can get them in my hands. In terribly sorry about this, they usually never do this to me and it's a first for them having a delay. I'm sorry and if you want i can refund you some of the shipping as an apology.
--------

Feb 11 on Forum Me:
So you make custom battery pack too? If so I wanna order.
—————

Alextech:
Yeah of course I do lol. 
What do you want? ( Cell count)

Me:
12s4p.
Diagram(not quite correct, but an idea how you mount them):

Alextech:
$390 will be the total.

 -------

May 13 Alex:
Hey Sander! 

I've gotten on the fourm for a brief moment with the help of some other mods, Im going to be more active on there now, as For the packages they did me a fast one, or did something and tried to deliver but Couldn't, I have the packages right now state sides, I'm going to have to ship Agian. I'm putting some other Esk8 items as apologies. My recovery is coming along well I only have one more surgery to go and I should be back in action. From now on my responses should be much more frequent. I appreciate your patience, and give me a couple weeks I'll refund you a portion of what you paid for the hubs 
 -------

Me:
Can you send it with a faster shipment? 
Like 1 week? Thanks :)
And good luck with the surgery!
-------

Me:
The refund is not necessary if you ship it with DHL or any other faster shipment.
I think DHL allows battery shipments.
-------

May 18 Me:
Hi! 
When are the packages shipping?
I need my board done before summer.

Refund is not needed if you choose a fast/faster shipment ;)
 -------

Me:
And if you are wondering I have waited over ~100 days.
-------

Alex:
Hey Sander! Do not worry, I have contacted DHL and I had to setup and account and get verified but It looks like I will be able to ship with them now! Mind send your adress to me one more time? Thanks!

I made sure to toss in extras urethanes in there free of charge that what you don't need to pay ridiculous shipping prices.

And when you are gonna give me the tracking you don't response on weeks and month! Im going insane.
 -------

Alex:
Hey Sander! No, I haven't received it yet, my assistant didn't feel confident doing the international shipping so I told him not to touch it till I got back home, I'm home now. I'll be shipping it today 5/3/17 and I shall be getting you a tracking# with it :) I didn't feel like making him send it, then messing it up and loosing another $300 package. Hope you understand!

Much thanks, Sander

Jun 12 Me:
Hey Alex, where are my package with the hub motor and battery in it?
I have waited for it over 130 Days and im getting sick and tired of you stoping to answer for weeks!

ITS ALL THE SAME OVER AND OVER, When you say "I have shipped it" you go silence for weeks, when I ask for the tracking number over and over again you say, I forgot to write it down etc. The same OVER and OVER again!

I used alot of my money I have saved for years, and now I now its gone. 

Thanks alot for nothing, im not mad at you, just really really dissapointed...
 ------

And then suddenly he replies:

Jun 3 Alex:
Hey Sander, 

Let me explain a bit here, see a few days or a week ago we got the package shipped but DHL and they just bill us directly, when they picked up the package we assumed it was going to be around $70USD to $100USD but ig was going to run us about $220USD which is about half of the cost of the Hubs, we know you would like the hubs then a refund and makes sense, so I had to brainstorm on how to get you a pair without spending $400 to get them to you haha, meanwhile my trips to China have made it so I can get you the hubs but actually better news with it, we have been making upgrades to the design to compete with the Raptor 2, what we are going to do is we are going to send you the new HUB motors straight from the Factory since they are geographically closer to you and won't cost us a arm and a leg to you, now, also for your inconvenience I'm going to send you a 90mm selve for the motors for a smoother ride, I hope this gives you a bit of insight on to our operations, I can totally get the whole situation your in, I know I'm fully invested in this as well . Im making mistakes but I'm always trying to rectify them, with that I'm going to make this right by you and ensure you that your going to get a quality product and not something dead cheap. The production of the HuBs will be done later this week, they will be shipping DHL if not FED EX Express international. I'm sorry for the inconvenience but I can only hope you see where I'm coming from and my good intentions. 

Thank you Sander, 
 ------

*SPOILERS: FALSE HOPE AGAIN!*

Me:
Awesome! Thats really cool! Thank you for explaining.
I do not want refund.

What about the 12s4p battery?

Thanks, Sander
 ------

Me:
The new hubs got me VERY interested! I really want to see how they look like, do you have any pictures of them?

Thanks, Sander.
 ------

Jun 15 Alex:
I'll get you some sample pictures if course! Also they will provide me with a tracking number for sure. 
 ------

Me:
Awesome! You are the best :)
 ------

Jun 16 Me:

and, what about my batteries?

Thanks, Sander.
 ------

Jun 18 Me:
So how is it going? Is it shipped?
And when do  you ship the batteries?

Thanks, Sander.
 ------

Jun 19 Alex:
Hey Sander, 

Going Great! Manufacture Said there was a bit of a Delay for the Hubs, New Date they gave me was the 22nd. 

The battery i have to check on due to WH Restrictions but let me double check! 
 ------

Me:
Ahh, keep me updated!

Thanks, Sander.

Jun 22 Me:

And please give me the tracking number.

Thanks, Sander.

Yes this is my experience with the guy known as Alex Arreguin.
He says he went on a business trip to china while he goes at high school? 
«I have classes everyday from 8 to 3:35. I don't always have acess to this forum but on my website is all my extra contact info like email and phone number which I can acess on my phone I can in my class.»

Well in total I used
440 Dollars for the Battery 
245 Dollars for the hub motors.
In total 685 Dollars.

My feelings right now:
Im angry, I don’t have much money, I am sad.
and I’m 16 years old..

I also had a bad experience with Alex. He sold me a "modified" version of the mach 1 (it was just an older one put together on a different deck and stuff. Thankfully I seem to be one of few that actually received my product. However, his communication skills are terrible. I had to basically keep nagging him to actually send the board after him telling me that he would send it over the course of a week of so. All I can say is DO NOT deal with him anymore. I feel bad for all the people that have not gotten their things or refunds. I am also 16 and the whole experience was frustrating.

I'm pretty sure internet scams are illegal. Also, running scams internationally is maybe frowned upon a little. At this point, you guys have a long list of proof and monetary totals. You have proof over and over again that he's lying. 

My advice, take all of this with your paypal or transfer receipts and first call his local police dept. (internet crime division) Then, call his bank and ask for the dept. that handles fraud. File a complaint and get whatever you need from them to forward to the police dept.

Then look up international laws with the postal service. 

Start filing complaints and then take action. It's starting to sound like his totals are not so much misdemeanor but felony.

Time is not going to be your friend here and Alex knows it. Nothing is going to happen if you guys wait.

100% agree with all of this! If I wasn't lucky enough to get my money back from Paypal, my plan was to definitely look into other options whether that was sending a legal notice by mail to his house or seeing if I could get police involved. If any of you pursue this or need additional receipts for proof then let me know! :neutral_face:

Stay away from ad hominem attacks or things that can be construed as slander or threats of physical harm (IANAL but my brother is and this is probably a good idea, plus just be a decent human on the forum). 

The facts and evidence seem to be strongly on your side (buyers) so stick with that and get it resolved.  Good luck! Hope you're all able to work things out.

I have been following this thread and I must say it really saddens me to see a situation like this on a forum where being trustworthy and having a good reputation is so valuable.

Here is my 2 cents for what it's worth.
In reality, you could possibly go to civil court and get a judgement. That doesn't necessarily  mean that you will be able to collect. 
I mean really, your talking about a kid with no money or real property. Do you think you can "squeeze blood out of a turnip"? Ya that's a really old saying. 
And good luck getting the local police to do anything about it. 

You will probably have better results if you just contact your bank and file for a charge back if you used a credit card on the website.
if you used Paypal "goods and services" then file a claim through PayPal first.
If you used Paypal "friends and family" you could still try to get your money back through your bank although PayPal will not be happy with you.
I did get a refund on a PayPal payment once through my bank without first contacting PayPal and they got mad and gave me a stern rebuke but they did not cancel my account. Not for the first offense.

If none of these options help you, Then your probably gonna have to suffer the loss and learn from it.
Sometime life lessons are expensive. I personally threw away $8000 on a bad deal and have nothing to show for it now.
Lesson learned and I will never make that mistake again! I am much older and hopefully a lot wiser now.
There is another old saying "Buyer Beware"
Don't make large purchases without buyer protection.
Don't buy anything online especially from people you don't know without buyer protection.
If your buying used gear, pay the extra for buyer protection, It's well worth it.
Thats all I have to say.

Try this, and if that dosnt work try small claims court I guess. You would technically be suing his parents as you can't sue a minor and he would of had to operate a PayPal in his parents name or make a fictitious one. 

Here is some more info about that:

I'd like to propose a different kind of solution, if you all are willing to trust me to give it a try:

Let me take a week to communicate with the school that @Alextech received his initial seed funding from, and I'll diplomatically explain the issue to see if we can come to a resolution. I think I can explain the situation without condemnation of anyone, and perhaps help them to see how @Alextech is at the point where he needs the responsible adults in his life to step in and assist. I'm a professor so maybe that will help in the communication.

It's worth noting that it is a private school that appears to have quite a lot of financial resource. I'd think that the relatively small loss to pay out everyone here would not overwhelm them. At the very least, they could get @Alextech's advisors and parents involved to clean up this situation. 

As a youth, he is in way over his head at this point. Contacting the BBB isn't going to resolve anything. He's got no legal business structure (not an LLC or Corporation), no liability insurance, and no legal adult to recognize as a legal entity. There's no one to seek legal recourse from besides his guardians, and that would require legal processing that would cost more time and money for everyone.

I'd need a comprehensive list of each person that paid him, how much they paid, how long they've waited, and one-sentence statement about the state of communication i.e. "I've been promised a refund but I've waited for 2 months with no further communication." Can someone compile this as a google doc for me?

If you like this approach, I'll put time into doing my best to get it resolved. I can't promise a quick resolution but I believe it's the best shot at getting everyone reimbursed. I'll post updates here, or in a new thread so we can all following along.

BTW - I didn't buy anything from @Alextech but as a mod on the forum I think I should step in to help.

Thank you so much @treenutter ! That is some sound thinking and I am defenitely on board. For whoever decides to make the google doc (I am on my phone and computer is dead atm):

I sent @Alextech 190$USD via PayPal Business in March in exchange for 1x VESC and 1x Spotwelder. His communication has been spotty at best, and when I last heard from him in early May he promised to send me the package with a free on/off switch to make up for the inconvenience.

@SirDiff Unfortunately one if things my lawyers advised me is that no matter if you sign a release of liability, you can still be sued, also should be mentioned we have the insurance to cover us in the case of any legal matters.

Since the seller is unresponsive, and likely a teenager with no legal obligation to you, we will reach out to the adults/educators in his life to promote a resolution. The expectation is that they are unaware of the situation and will want to help. Keep in mind that he was able to sell to you because they funded him in the first place, so they should have an interest in finding a solution.

Here's what's right the battery began to ignite for no reason while I was in a car with my family, at the time the only thing I cared about was the safety of my family I managed to salvage a few parts but had to disassemble cell groups for safety concerns. Which I think u would understand with your young children. <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/9/a/9a605120b6bec00c2123c4262e98466ec7e8642b.JPG" width="666" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/6/1/617647fcd150150b917c0cec271e2a6aaf4cbda7.JPG" width="666" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/e/c/ec214a3d286e3c7dead282d6bcef2ca7489160bb.JPG" width="666" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/4/7/475f22911f487556bba1aa54cdfcbd873ba9902b.JPG" width="666" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/d/e/de4b5d645c807a10f239cc651ebe9e27777983a3.JPG" width="666" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/b/9/b98f05a2fe2aed78508d20cb357a4c169bb4e457.JPG" width="666" height="500">

Proof of in spot welded joints damages to personal belongings and the car is currently parked so I will have to inspect it majority of damages besides the battery were absorbed by the jacket

Edit: if this is not enough for you I have 5 witnesses that were in the vehicle at the time and one roadside serviceman who pulled over thinking we had car troubles to find a battery smoking next to our car as I tried to remove a smoldering smoking cell group to Toss it.

I purchased a mach 1 elite on 3/1/2017 w/ 12s4p and dual hubs for 1,150.00 and this is what I was led to believe - that I'd have a board within a week:
> Now your in luck because i have the parts to start building a "Mach 1 Elite" in either configuration (hubs or Belt) Which speeds up the delivery time by 3 days. If you paid today i would be less than a week for it to be done and ready for all the hell you can throw at it.

My last communication was in May.  I have not asked for a refund yet, but that seems unlikely to happen... I've been waiting for my shipment.

The worse part of this is the opportunity lost with all the time I missed *not* enjoying my board.  I'm really frustrated because I could have used that money to build it myself.  I was trying to purchase this board to learn from.

I feel like an idiot now.

TBH with most this would be obvious... I'm not sure but I seemed to be able to justify everything that raised eyebrows initially.  There were a few things that I think caused me to look passed this:

* he used broken english in his sentences
* he strung sentences together like he didn't care about punctuation, sentences, grammar, or english
* he didn't answer questions directly/head on, or seemed to not quite understand different parts of the conversation.

The only thing he did clearly write and communicate to me in that interaction was what I posted, which was the bit about payment and delivery.

In hindsight you may read the above and be like "Dude, WTF.... ?"

I'm used to dealing with foreigners and foreign business people whom don't quite understand the conversation at the edges but understand the gist of it.  It seemed reasonable to me that the friction in doing business and communicating would be because he's not from the U.S.

In addition to all of that, he seemed to have a heavy presence on these forums, and interactions with people on these forums who seem very knowledgable and respected in the community which squashed my concerns.

* I can't begin to elaborate how much this swayed my judgement.  
* There was nothing but positive interaction with him on the forums by others until 1.5 months in
* It really is what provided the confidence that he was on the up and up.

I honestly thought that I was dealing with someone who was an adult and not from this country, 
 whom was trying to bootstrap a business.  I thought he had challenges learning the language but was not too concerned.  It also seemed easy for me to justify his lack of business acumen and customer service which I chalked up to a lack of experience here in the U.S. and dealing with other businesses and vendors.  

I thought he had a lot of challenges in his business but to be 100% honest I felt good in supporting him.  I liked his message and his goal about making an affordable e-skate for the mid-quality market.  I wanted to support that and "vote with my dollars" a little bit.

Seriously.  I feel like a complete idiot.  He's a little boy.

It was the opposite for me. I noticed he stepped into the sales arena immediately. Then he presented himself as knowledgeable. In like a weeks time he was coming at people as if he was the go-to for everything! 2 times he got called out on stealing proprietary slogans or names. 
Absolutely nothing he had was original. His pictures, branding, specs, products. Info-All copy and pasted. 

I pointed out to buddy's how bad it was. It frustrated me instantly that anyone could come onto this forum and act like they were running the show. In fact, it's discouraging for me to personally work so hard on my own products, to see how easily duped this community can be! Constantly!!!

I hope you guys get your money back. And I hope that you'll do some proper research and build your own boards. I hope that you'll stop overlooking the vendors that are here helping you whether you give them money or not just so you can save $3 on a groupbuy but spend $20 more on shipping/waiting and not get what you paid for anyway...

I'd have agree with Dave, and the noobs especially should be sticking with reputable vendors for the time being. You guys are gonna see more and more people offer goods and services at good price, but with a dark cloud of uncertainty if you will get the product or if it's even worth buying.  For the noobs, work with established vendors. They will be able to help you with the products they sell. It's worth paying an perceived premium, than going cheap. Especially in the DIY arena. This is especially true for the noobs. 

 As you learn abt esk8 and the community, you'll be able to make an educated decision on weather to deal or take a chance on someone selling in the esk8 arena ....of course there are examples of established people/vendors where people did not get the products as promised or specified (not gonna name who) so it's not 100%.

Were there red flags on this? Yeah for me...but as mentioned @Alextech was engaging. So, that is that. As a senior member here I saw the red flags too, but I didn't say anything because I didn't have any business dealings with him.  Not sure if that the correct tact to take, but i don't want to be the esk8 vendor police. So, what do we do in the future to reduce the risk? Think it may be time to reign this in before things become a real problem in the community.

Alright - you all can stop assuming that we did no research.  Its insulting enough already - don't insult me by thinking I did no due diligence before making the purchase.  

I sat and observed his actions on the forums for a week or two before I made the decision.  I had been researching for months what I wanted/needed up to that point.

I also PM'd a handful of members on this forum inquiring about him and they vouched for his credibility.  Unfortunately I was not witness to the times he was called out - perhaps that was before my time.

He was doing several business deals with several other creditable members of the forum.  I can go back and start cut and pasting names and convos - you don't think that adds to his credibility when someone is dealing with him to purchase a board?  I mean seriously don't be so insulting - telling everyone to work with creditable people and at the same time saying you saw all the signs but didn't say anything.

Who the fuck do you think I thought I was working with?

I was not purchasing this in a vacuum.

You asked what he had to offer?  He was building me a custom board that checked all my boxes and it was $300 cheaper than anywhere else I could find for similar specs?

Seriously all of you can stop rubbing our noses in it now.

Some possible routes to take, 

**Have, some sort of proof for ability to deliver.** If its being something that your making, **show proof** that you have all the materials in stock.

**Of course this may be difficult to show if its a group buy.** But I had to put forth a lot of money on my first GB. For those that sent money via Service, I asked for them to pay the fee, which they did, for those that sent via Fri&Fam they saved money, in my case, I had no intent to steal, as I am really loving the esk8. So they had nothing to lose.
**For me, I showed everything relating to the GB, all pictures and proof, I even gave contacts.** Personally, it was difficult to make any money at all on it, and that's why I ordered motors for myself because at-least it saved me some money as-well, in customization and final cost vs HobbyKing.

This.  

Dealing in this community already feels largely unprofessional and loosely gathered to begin with.  So when looking for someone to purchase services from around here - even the lack of a website isn't that much a of a red flag.

All we have to go off of is the digital trail left behind in the interactions on this forum and the information people choose to provide for transparency.

The only information I found on on these forums actually resolved my reservations because it was all positive.  I searched... I did not find negative interactions at the time.

A spot welder. There's my answer. He said that he had a used spot welder that was ready to go, and I need one to build my 12s battery. Looking at @willpark16's battery though, I don't think it would even have enough power to make a single weld. I payed 190USD for that + a VESC which he also claimed was more resilient than the typical 4.12 VESCs. Whatever - at this point I am hoping for Paypal to just issue my refund quickly. The only thing I seem to have done right with this transaction was insisting on paying him through business and not friends and family. Definitely worth the 3% fee or whatever it was

Perhaps the mods should look into creating a vendor section on this site? A place that lists all known vendors, whether amateurs, group buys, or professional companies, and members can post reviews and the results they've had with each specific vendor.

I know there have been objections to dealing with customer complaints on this forum, but if it was contained to one section of this site, I think it wouldn't be a problem.

That way, new builders could see which vendors are reputable and which are not, as well as see all available vendors so that they could comparison shop and not miss out on vendors like you described above.

The VESC was 90$. The Spotwelder he said was 100. It looked like a great deal to me. You are correct about another thing as well - people (including myself) should have done more research on this kid. I have bought from experience sellers many times on this forum (including you) and I have bought from less experienced sellers twice. Both of those two times I ended up having to go through PayPal to deal with the problem. 

FOR ANYONE WHO READS THIS ENTIRE THREAD:

Don't just do research to find out what parts you need - figure out the right places to get them as well. Use reputable sources, and find good people. Here is my personal list of good vendors (from experience):

@psychotiller
@treenutter
@barajabali
@oriol360
@JLabs

_I don't think you should be saying blanket statements like this to try and prove points_  

This is your opinion 100% and you are also assuming far too much.  If you read what I wrote previously (it's ok I wrote a lot) you would see that I was getting a **custom build**.  So how do you know yours were better at all?  You are presuming so.  

How can you say better attention to detail when your site looks like it does?  Your site isn't more confidence inspiring than his was at the time... I am being brutally honest with you right now. I'm comparing https://psychotiller.com/product/custom-build-1 with https://www.aatorquesystems.com/product-page/mach-1-elite as a consumer and a web-developer.

His blows yours out of the water.  He has more attention to detail just comparing these two pages.  I would trust his before yours - and my 15 years of experience building websites and doing customer usability research informs me that any consumer with $1300 to spend would agree with me.  You obviously do not weight they same things I do as a consumer - instead you say we are 'noobs' and just don't know.

The custom build you offer right now for $1300 does not stack up to the spec's I was purchasing at $1150 and would perform like crap where I live in S.F.  I need more battery and more low-end torque and I need a shit ton more than you're offering at 1300 because every hill where I live is between 15-23 degrees and I live at the top of a 2-mile long hill climb.

* Nope - again I PM'd other people on these forums and did lots of research.  You didn't read what I wrote.  He was not the first person I reached out to.  

I actually tried to reach out to 4 or 5 other reputable members to purchase boards or inquire about a custom for my needs and never got responses from quite a few and the 2 that did respond to me referred me to others who did not respond to my PM's.

I wanted to find someone local - in my area to work with.  I wanted to support a local e-skate company that was offering completes (he's local to me, within an hour).

Anytime, and I mean anytime you want to meet up and compare boards let me know. Actually there are plenty of other members closer to you than me that have purchased from me. I'm sure they'll set you straight.

I just got parts and this and that so another week but I'd rather sell to local people than anywhere else. 
These are motors based off the old I used to sell at Steelhubs.com with a bunch of upgrades. 
Depending how much of a hobbyist u are,  or how cheap, you could wind these yourself

I bet any board could get up ur driveway if u up'd the amps to the motor. All these vehicles w out runner motors have a peak power / torque that can do it just a question of how much power from the esc to motor u set it to and how efficient u want to be or how long the road is
@localredhead what's ur hill/driveway?  I'll come over and do it at 25mph

I just received the spot welder but not VESC... he did include a message and money to compensate for the VESC but as I stated before, at this point I am simply waiting for a refund. He also said that there would be a manual IN ENGLISH so that I could use the spot welder. There wasn't. The package was beat up and the welder sounded like it had multiple items rattling inside. I am sending it back. Here's a few quick pictures:<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/7/d/7d37f521b3316001e287d7908e5714e528be2c38.JPG" width="375" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/4/c/4c9b5d11f60bae1688a9a6cb683428d5f6c8cd63.JPG" width="375" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/d/1/d15dddd8769739096e3a56386d194e881e1d06d0.JPG" width="375" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/7/f/7f15c9e611ceea5f28ce2ad1f1021abb1c5d0a40.JPG" width="375" height="500">

Man, you really got me thinking about my site, so I checked his site out just to see where I was lacking.

His "our story" section really hit home!

"I was tired of seeing everyone getting ripped off with these cheap Chinese clones from kickstarters and getting empty promises " -Alex 

"What originally started as simply building my own Electric Longboard  (or more commonly known as a Esk8)  became much more. The inception of the company started by just being sick of hearing about all the people who were getting ripped off by the many failed kickstarter projects, the amount of unsafe and untested Esk8 out there, and finally about just the amount of people who were becoming a victim of this. So I began to sell these boards to my friends who then told they're friends, and so on. With the Help of the DIY community we have brought the quality and value to these boards to everyone, No more thousand dollar boards that can even climb the smallest of hills. Even if you are a power hungry user, or hill climber, here at AATS we can do it all and best part of it, it's all tailored to you. Try to do that Esk8 Giants."

Questions...
How many of his boards are out being ridden right now?
How many boards total do you think were bought and resold?
What is the actual timeline that he did all of this testing?

Did he ever find the mythical beast called "low end torque" with his chinese hub motors?
Isn't it ironic that all of these said victims are mostly here in this thread? Dontcha think?

May have missed your point (was there one?) but, I think I could do a hell of a lot worse with my site now...

Guys, stop it now. @psychotiller, while we all know your products are excellent, your site does look less professional, from a noob's point of view. A graphic restyle would be enough to solve it. 
@localredhead it happens. It didn't look right, the price was just too low and he hadn't been around for long enough. But it wasn't actually that fishy, cause with a couple of group buys you can get those parts and sell the build for that price, but with very little profit. He could have looked legit, also cause he delivered a couple of boards, but  seeing the results, this is scary.

[/quote]

I have no doubt your motors can do it!  I've seen videos of the older ones and I've been dreaming about a 4wd version of something like that :)

I am more DIY than anything.  I like building/tinkering more than riding.  I want to learn to build these... But I'll be honest - I don't like the idea of winding the motors myself yet.  I'd rather focus my craftsmanship elsewhere but if I had the guidance of someone more experienced I'd do it.

@Hummie https://www.google.com/maps/dir/37.7460798,-122.4473135/135+Red+Rock+Way,+San+Francisco,+CA+94131/@37.7463356,-122.4470701,17z/am=t/data=!3m1!4b1!4m8!4m7!1m0!1m5!1m1!1s0x808f7e0b4cfc0f79:0x909f12f397bae02d!2m2!1d-122.4419974!2d37.7462028  This is the pathway up from the school nearby my apartment up to my apartment.  I need something that bombs UP this hill and has enough juice to get me around for 12+ miles of terrain sprinkled with hills like this.  This hill is mild compared to many around here and if I was coming home from bart it would be much much steeper at parts and sustained for 1+ miles.  If I was riding the board all the way home from the finance district it gets even worse and 5 times longer.

@psychotiller send someone with your product over here to show me a build that checks my boxes and I'll buy it.  I have no doubt you *can* build a board that gets me there

How many of his boards are out being ridden right now?
How many boards total do you think were bought and resold?
[/quote]
I don't know if it was his friends, or actual people who purchased boards at this point but there were a few.  I recall at least 2-3 instances of other users who commented purchasing his boards or previously owning one.  

I can say the same about other reputable board builders based on my limited interaction here.  Its not my life I am just a consumer.  I only have a limited amount of time in my life fixing screwed up websites to focus on things I want to... its not who is the best builder on these forums... I see a lot of people disagree about what seem to be fundamental things and yet they are both revered and respected as builder in their own right.  Its really not as binary as you try to make it seem.

[quote="psychotiller, post:204, topic:25597, full:true"]

I don't know - Do you?  It seemed to go back far enough to be as credible as anything else at the time the video's for these motors aren't even that old...

At least it loads fast.

You're the one that brought your site into this and made it about how much better your shit was and finger wagging my choice because you, for instance, are one example of exemplar quality.  Do I need to circle back that far? I poked holes in what you said and here we are 2 pages later.  Its not that far to scroll.

You like to generalize.  I don't have to generalize I can be very specific and targeted to respond.  I'll fix your site for a board that can make it up my hill.

This is exactly what he said when I asked about the price and how he was able to do it.  I reasoned that this is why he was more aggressive about timing and getting payment sooner because he had the parts in stock supposedly to build a board that week.

When I finally received my complete from Alex, it came in a flimsy cardboard box with absolutely no packing material.

Hey ! (Gøy å se flere nordmen her)

I found a post on the market by AlexTech in May and contacted him 14th of May to buy a Vesc and a 12mm belt. I transfered 115USD to him and he told me it would arrive at my place in two weeks.
Nothing ever came so I have contacted him again and again and it's essentialy the same story as every one else. He had a tracking number for me, then he didn't because "something big was going on at AA" and then he wanted to wait for a new vesc batch witch shoud be less prone to faliure, etc. 

So you can definitely write me on that list although I consider my money lost.

Here's a link to the listing, if anyone is interested :)

Just don't contact anyone until @treenutter solved the problem.

Thanks for your confidence in me @Sander. I'll do my best to assist, but of course I cannot promise that I will be able to bring about a change. I'll try my best, but it will be up to @Alextech to make everything right.

But I believe in the good in @Alextech that he wanted to send it and all that. Maybe this is just a big miss understanding. If he knew he couldn't ship/send with no confirmation of the product exist, he should not have taken any orders tho, especially with no good communication,..

Hi All, I spoke w @Alextech this afternoon. The call went well. We arranged to have a conference call later this week, or early next, with @Alextech's business mentor. I'll be on the call to represent the forum folks, and we'll collaborate to figure out a strategy to get each person's outstanding issue resolved. 

I think this is good progress, mainly in that we're giving @Alextech some structure to address the issues he's facing. I'll report back again after our call with his mentor. In the meantime, please keep communication civil and solution-oriented. Let's not focus too much on the past mistakes, however troublesome. What matters now is that everyone ends up with either a sufficient refund or a quality product. We'll work towards that.

how often do we have to post an easy fix for the slipping issue until people realize there never was an actual issue?
I am riding my hubs since the beginning and never had my urethane slip. 
With minimal effort (duct tape and some rods) you can fix this in minutes (if it occurs at all).
That whole problem got blown way out of proportion.
If you take pictures with the urethane off I can tell you if they actually improved anything besides harder urethane (which will make your ride worse as the wheels are already letting through all the vibrations due to the thin urethane) - somehow I doubt it.

voltage is never an issue (in the limits we typically use - it will be if you go ridiculously high with 100s of Volt) but only current matters for our motors.

The business mentor has not responded to the invitation for a conference call after his first message, and @Alextech hasn't made progress on scheduling the call. I've reminded @Alextech several times to move on this.

I've independently written to the mentor w no response yet. I told @Alextech that if the mentor seems unavailable, we should discuss togehter with his parents or legal guardians. The deadline I set for @Alextech to have a call scheduled was today,

The next step, if @Alextech is unresponsive,  is for me to contact with his school or family independently. I had hoped to make progress together. My goal is to work with @Alextech to get this solved, but if he is too nervous to take action, I'll make an attempt to contact others that could help.

I received this message from Alex.

"Brandon Looking at the spread sheet, a little hard to follow what exactly you wanted? we offered to send you the refund for the difference a while ago, you then still haven't sent the parts out, acting like a hostage situation lol. We Just assume your busy, but we can and will send you that refund if you are to send back the extra parts you have to us. If not we really cant do much man, we have sent you little over $1,000 Of parts well over the amount you paid. We did this to hope to make it right by you as our first customer. But despite this it seems we didn't come to the same consensus. Like above, we can most definitely work to get you the $150 difference if you send the parts if not, like stated we can not do much."

Thank you 
-Alex

I'll make it clear what I want right here in the public forum. I want a refund for the difference between the "Mach 1" and the "Mach 1 Elite". I want a refund for the deck I had to replace and the enclosure which was destroyed when the shitty, broken deck he originally sent cracked in half once I was finally able to get it to work.  I don't want to front the money for returning his crappy Maytech components (half of which I should just throw away because they are toast). I want to receive the money it will take to ship this stuff back to him up front, because I trust him to not do good on his word to send me the refund once I've done my part of the deal. There is no reason to hold onto his garbage hubs and bootloader-less maytech vescs.

I also want him to stop lying to me and everyone else about the steps he's going to take to make things right. For... 4 months now he's been promising me the refund, a new enclosure, a replacement for the charging port which broke, and new belts. Before this thread, he would claim he shipped this stuff, but obviously he never did because he refused to provide a tracking number and it never showed up. 

So I'm being as fair as possible, I will take the shit I'm going to return to him and get a quote for the shipping cost. Then it's very simple. $100 for the difference between the two models, $50 for the replacement deck, $50 for the replacement enclosure, plus whatever cost it is for me to ship his crap back to him.

Alex also keeps lying to me about being his first customer. However, when I originally talked to him about buying his complete, he told me I wasn't the first, that he had shipped a complete to another customer in Turkey.

All, @Alextech's business mentor has been unresponsive so we are no longer pursuing communication with that person. My goal has been to get a responsible legal adult to work with @Alextech to resolve the issues. 

I've asked @Alextech if he and I could have a discussion with his family to make a plan, then a series of responsible adults would be looking after him to get the refunds and orders processed. He declined my initial offer and I've written to him again with further explanation and asked him to reconsider.

I've asked him to make a call by the end of today about whether he might reconsider, so I'm waiting on that response. Please keep all posts and communications civil :)

I agree. He is obviously old enough to know between right and wrong, and what he did to others here is wrong. Just because he's young is no excuse for him NOT to take responsibility for his actions (or in this case, inaction) and mistakes.

Now i personally want to still build you your board that was promised to you. This is the easiest and fastest solution at the moment, but we can take a look at other options if you'd like but currently a refund might take a while as its a bugger amount.

I've stated my desire is only for a refund.

All, When @Alextech's business manager did not respond to our outreach, I suggested that he and I have a discussion with his parents. @Alextech is legally a minor, and my goal has been to get a legal adult involved in resolving all of the outstanding debt. He has declined my offer, despite my insistence, to have a call with his parents about the outstanding debts he has.

I've explained to him that if forum members organize and seek claims against him, his family could be responsible for that debt.

At this point, I have not heard from @Alextech in a week and I have decided to stop sending him daily reminders via text and email about the need to make progress.

I believe that he has the intention of refunding those that he can. However, I don't think that he has the financial resources to achieve this quickly, especially for the higher-cost refunds.

Has anyone on the list below *received* a payment or satisfactory product? Please note that a declaration from @Alextech that a refund/product is coming shouldn't be considered a resolution.

Let's be honest, he's a kid and scared of getting in trouble. He will not be resolving these problems as he does not have the money to make it right. If anyone still has a package from him I suggest using the return address in your favor. If you have an address finding out which school he attends it shouldn't be hard to deduce.

Its either that or he is still selling to get the money to use to fix things with old customers he wronged, but then that leaves him in the same or similar hole he was in before...but with the new customers he took money from. It's like he believes it'll magically fix itself but anyone who knows business knows that it doesn't work.

An endless, vicious cycle.

All his decisions are just escalating the problem...and it almost sounds like he doesn't care. I feel really bad for everyone who gave this guy a chance and got nothing but headaches in return...

For the future use builtwith.com to check what technologies were used to build a site:

https://builtwith.com/?https%3a%2f%2fwww.aatorquesystems.com%2f

If it is built with wix or godaddy website builder you know the person/company spent probably an hour working on the site another dead giveaway is the FAQ on the contact page:

"What makes you the best "value"?
Simple, we use Authentic LG HG2 18650, Samsung 25R that have" (sentence randomly ends here)

"How do I edit or remove the "FAQ title"?
The FAQ title can be adjusted in the settings tab of the App Settings. You can also remove the title by unchecking its checkbox in the settings tab."

Clearly didn't even remove the default FAQ entry that tells them how to remove FAQ entries, not a great sign.  I'll admit for a wix site it's pretty well done and I wouldn't have guessed wix on this one usually they look terrible.

The blog also has all default posts nothing actually updated except titles:

"To create your first blog post, click here and select 'Manage Posts' > New Post. Blogs are a great way to connect with your audience and keep them coming back. To really engage your site visitors we suggest you blog about subjects that are related to your site or business. Blogging is also really good for SEO, so we recommend including keywords that related to your site within your posts.
 
Good Luck!"

Not to say this gives anyone the right to rip people off but need to check into this stuff a little bit before throwing $1k at the monitor :)  Plus if people are willing to accept this level of quality (garbage) for a website how am I going to get paid for developing ones for real companies :)

>Isn't he 14 yrs old or something?

Kind of curious how this would play out in the courts... Cause on one hand Minors cannot enter into contracts so if you knew that and still bought things from him the contract is void.  
  
But on the other he's aggressively marketing his products, not meeting deadlines, etc. and appears to be fraudulent. If anyone has any evidence strong enough for a criminal fraud case you could go this way and then depending on the outcome of that could have a strong civil case. But expensive and time consuming.

@Alextech your profile shows you still visit this site. I strongly suggest you do something to make these guys believe you plan to do right by them or you will very soon be in a very bad situation. You are a minor which means this will all fall on your parents. When these guys have finally had enough you will be spending time in front of a judge with your parents to figure out how you will be paying these guys back.

All, Everyone who is owed something from @Alextech is now a part of a private discussion we are having about the next steps. We made an initial attempt to identify and hand-off responsibility for the debts to a legal adult on @Alextech's side.

The first attempt didn't work, so we are now taking additional steps to make sure everyone gets a refund. For that to work I need to ask everyone hold off on taking action without checking in with us. Let us do it together in a unified manner. This problem is complicated by several factors; the seller is a legal minor, some transactions were conducted as "friends and family," there is no business structure to sue, and communication from @Alextech is, as you all know, not adequate.  

Our community is a close-knit group of enthusiasts; **we trust each other** with advice, sales, and our successes and failures in building and design. I consider most of the regulars here personal friends that I would go out on a limb for. Like all of you, I really care about the community. So when someone comes into the group and rips people off, it really stings! How did we let a wolf into the den?!

Please know that we won't let the community become saturated with con-artists. We'll deal with it intelligently. We are far smarter than a 17-year-old that has learned to manipulate trust. We can handle it. I'll report back here once we've made progress.

I've used the supper/battery supports and bestech BMS's and I like the built in E-Switch on the bestech. Saves money on adding an external switch.  FYI, the supower BMS's support an E-Switch as well, you have to order them custom though.

@blasto that's just the beginning. Below are what i have found in this pack:

* Shitty no-flux no-flow low wattage solder welds
* solder where there should be tack welds
* solder where there were tack welds but they were maybe not good enough so they got solder also
* solder in places it shouldn't be, like maybe it dripped or was flung there
* tape holding broken welds together
* nickel that is too thin and too narrow for anything skateboard related. good for vaping packs or RC cars maybe. Looks like 6 mm width at much less than 15 mil. you need 10mm 15 mil strips minimum and when the cells aren't stacked in a triangular or trapezoidal pattern and are only directly in parrallel such as in a flat pack like this, you really should have two layers, but that's probably considered optional.
* apparently genuine LG HG2 cells, surprisingly. Was expecting who-knows clones from ebay
* no spacers or adhesives (i use hot glue) between cells to reduce axial or radial stress on the nickel strips during riding stressses, just packaging tape which doesn't do that job very well at all
* the black electrical tape used to hold the balance leads down and also apparent;y hold the broken welds together was wound in a hurry, you can see signs of seriously unpracticed rushing all throughout this pack. 
* the BMS is decent from what i can tell

on a lighter note, it does have red balance leads which i believe are the only things that allowed this pack to even register a voltage. The high performance red on the balance leads most likely created a power vacuum forcing  electron holes to open up in the power stream which allowed more electrons to flow from hole to hole, creating a false potential which drained immediately upon load. I'm pretty sure the red balance leads and red cells were also responsible for the inexplicable amount of power that we found in the raptor cells last year but that's only a theory. This does back some of that up though.

its worth mentioning that this pack was sent to me to fix. And i will be fixing it. ITs sad though because the owner already paid for a pack, and now he's got to pay another guy to clean up the first guy's mess. 

My plan is to tear this thing down completely, reinforce it, tear out the old nickel and polish the old welds down on the cell caps, re-tack it with decent nickel, and heat shrink it properly. 

My hope is that the cells aren't damaged and this 10S3P can actually put some juice out again.

At this point I feel bad for the kid. In highschool I was filled to the brim with stupid decisions. I tried many stupid things; made stupid movies, wrote and drew bad comic books, made shitty models and wood crafts, and was overly confident in my adolescent "genius" when I shouldn't have been. I'm glad the work I did then was and will never publicly scrutinized like his is now.

I think getting the message out regarding this vendor was important. Alex needs to fix what he did and make right with everyone who bought from him. He needs to own up to everything he's done. There is enough information to do that now. 

This begins to make me uncomfortable when the point of a post isn't about protecting members or about making things right and becomes about embarassing someone or using an unfortunate situation as fodder. This  is heightened by the fact that Alex is not yet an adult. I keep thinking of Catcher in the Rye and the scene where Holden's professor reads aloud his shitty essay to him. I also have kids and I can see my son getting in way over his head one day. If that ever happens you can be damn sure I'll be there to make sure he makes it right with anyone harmed and owns up to consequences. What I hope for though is that he doesn't get publicly shamed by a community of people he looks up to and the community he's in shows a little empathy.

True.

My opinion though, and I'm just throwing this out there, is that so far he's shown a lack of empathy and any semblance of a conscience regarding what's his done to others so far. And it's ticking people off, to the point where things got heated and emotional. 

@treenutter did his best to cool everyone down and to handle this situation quietly, so hopefully it's a lesson learned for this guy.

We're still working on it BTW... We're just doing so in a private discussion so as not to exacerbate the damages or threaten the process of getting good result. 

I agree with you, @guyguy, that when we're dealing with minors there is some additional tact that the grown-ups have to display. While not excusing excuse the unfair treatment that many members have received (nor the life-threatening battery packs that were sold) we're still dealing with a kid who needs the responsible adults in his life to step in. 

I tried working directly with said kid at the beginning of this process. We had phone calls, and  lots of email. I asked him to let me help make everything right. I tried to help him bring in assistance, recognizing that he is clearly over his head. He rejected the offer.

So now we're approaching the problem through other channels to help get everyone reimbursed. When it's over, we'll update publicly about what we did and the result.

While I agree wholeheartedly with your sentiment. I don't think it applies to Alex. He has shown no empathy. No remorse. No will to make things right. It could be said that he made attempts, but his payments didn't clear. His products were not good or incomplete, or just never sent. His site is still up falsely giving the impression his "company" can deliver something. 

Ever heard of Bernie Madoff? What do you think people think of that guy? 
He's not part of this community. He certainly doesn't respect or look up to anyone here. If you bought anything from him. You got scammed.

The boy needs a spanking. This is what a spanking looks like in 2017 now that corporal punishment is off the table and communities are electronically connected instead of physically. 

If i had done this shit at his age my neighbors would have yelled at me until my memomma got there, who would have yelled at me and then whipped me and then held me till my parents got there who would have both yelled at me then whipped me again. Then they would have made me eat something because i haven't eaten all day because i've been out doing this stupid shit. 

It used to take a village to raise a kid. 

it STILL takes a village but everyone is connected to those outside their area and not connected to their immediate communities anymore so what we end up with is this: A global fucking spanking on a severely public scale in a detached society of low empathy participants who act like they have no idea the person on the other side of the screen is real.

The village has changed, but the raising still needs to happen. 

Reach out and touch someone.

@treenutter I appreciate the steps taken so far by you and the other admins on this forum. All of you are what makes this community what it is. Thanks. 

As this forum grows there may need to be a verification is needed before posting as a merchant -- at minimum the vendor needs to be 18. 

@psychotiller I don't think empathy is something that's deserved or earned (it rarely is either). Empathy is something that's given. 

Everything you've said is right - his site should be taken down, people should know not to buy from him et cetera. I would even go as far as saying law enforcement should be involved. It's when this conversation veered into embarassing him that I think it starts to get shaky - then it's not about justice or making things right - it turns into us making ourselves feel superior and having a laugh at a child's expense. The fact that he's an unrepentant scammer does not excuse all other behavior toward him, especially since he's a kid. I'll be honest though, if he were an adult all my high-horse talk of empathy would probably go out the window.

I think the lesson he'll receive will be real-life consequences from the responsible parties (parents/guardians/school/creditors). Thanks to @longhairedboy and @psychotiller for making sure that useful information is being shared to alert everyone about this "seller."  

@guyguy I've shown him a LOT of empathy. I've put a lot of time into trying to address the situation, as have others. Despite the many angry posts we've seen about this, many people have tried to help/nudge the kid into action, and he squirmed away every time. 

Using mod superpowers, I've deleted a lot of inappropriate threats to the kid... people are outraged, and rightfully so, but the threats of violence and personal injury are where we draw a line on the forum (unless they are jokes, and these weren't!)

We've changed the way we monitor group buys now, and of course we'll work toward even better assurance of legit sellers.

I don't understand why some of the people who were scammed don't go to his house and have sit down with him? I'm not saying be threatening, but go talk to him AND his parents in person to make them aware of the situation and let AlexTech know that you're not just going to drop the issue, and if he keeps ignoring it, he's potentially in for a lawsuit. I think an in person conversation might get through to him better than online communication.

Yeah, the problem comes if you don't get off his property when asked. Or if you get violent or abusive (verbal threats or something). Just don't do that, it won't help this.

A good point was made. If he has boards in stock. Or other parts in stock that he owes people. Call the Local Sheriffs dept. Show them what is going on. And go to his house with the sheriff to pick up what you've paid for. A couple of you are close enough to pull that off.

Outside of that, which would be a legit way to deal with this little shit, The local news loves scammers too!

All, we've been working on resolving this issue in a private thread. It is time consuming to track down information, coordinate a response, and bring it to the right authority.

We are keeping the process private because we don't want to threaten the outcome by making it public. The goals are to get everyone refunded, and to make sure AA does not scam anyone again.

I appreciate that everyone is frustrated, but those financially impacted are a part of the response.

I'm seeing jokes here about prison rape, and other direct actions that could perceived as threatening. **_We are dealing with a legal minor._**  Please keep that in mind. In the eyes of the law, he's the same a twelve year old (no offense to any 12-year-olds).

At some point legal authorities might come and look through the forum. Do you know what will happen in court when they find threats of violence or assault here?... They'll impart empathy toward the minor being threatened by a bunch of grown men. 

Please act like the stellar grown men that you are and go delete anything that could be perceived as a threat to a legal minor. Otherwise, you're just making more work for us as we try to resolve it.

@treenutter I applaud your efforts to find a reasonable solution to this problem, but also find it appalling and utterly ridiculous that Alex still has his website up and is actively telling other members that he can or will sell them product. I'm not sure how far your talks have progressed with him or the adults representing him, but is it too much to ask that he take down his website and stop responding to people as if he is still running a legitimate business? As we've seen so far, even if he does deliver, it almost certainly will be a subpar, faulty or downright dangerous product, which will only result in more scammed victim's and more issues for you to help resolve. His lack of respect and obvious morals, and his intent to continue to scam and deceive people infuriates me and I haven't even purchased anything from him. :rage:

It is a joke but not a joke, stuff like that happens in Juvi as well. We don’t put people like that in jail. It’s the system puts people like this is jail due to their own doing. 

Much respect @treenutter for trying to work on this for the people here...but when is enough, ENOUGH? You guys have been working on this since June.  Site is still up and he’s still obviously willing to take orders as they come through.  I don’t know about you but looks like to me he’s giving the big “FUCK YOU” middle finger by still having an active site and zero response. 

IMO you have been more than fair with him, including all the jokes and hate. Both ways to deal with a crappy situation weather involved or not. Although there are people here that have not purchased anything from him, he still affects us....it puts doubt in our head abt new vendors selling items, he conned our friends and still out to con more people....when and who is gonna stop him?  

As a group you have had the proof of what this person is doing.  You’ve had it. It’s OCTOBER and it’s not looking better. 

Unless legal action is taken, I guarantee he hides out hoping you all go away.

Thx @Michaelinvegas  and @Mobutusan I understand (and share) your frustrations... but I have to reiterate that we are working on the problem and progress is being made. If it feels like it is taking a long time, it's most likely because we are not yet sharing our course of action publicly. If it's not looking better, it's because we aren't posting the incremental steps we've taken. 

This isn't to be secretive or withholding from the community here; it's to prevent any subversive actions AA or involved parties might take. It makes no sense to share or discuss the approach publicly.

Please everyone be patient. The problem is not being ignored. It takes time to properly prepare a defensible response and we are doing as well as we can.

Do you think _I'm_ gonna "let it slide?" No way. We'll have a good result eventually.

Hi All, 

It's time to put a period at the end of this crappy chapter of diyesk8 history. 

You can read above to learn all about how a person ripped off a bunch of forum members by promising to sell them parts or a complete board, taking their money, but then never sending product or issuing a refund.

I tried help those impacted (i.e. those that ordered parts or a complete that they never received) organize and plan to take action. The goal was to get everyone refunded in the most "painless" way possible. We stopped posting publicly about our actions because there was a risk of diminishing the effectiveness of our plan if shared publicly.

Important detail:  the "seller" was a legal minor. This limits what is legally possible in follow-up. The seller also received many payments via Paypal "friends and family" which we no longer allow in group buys on the forum because there is little recourse available to the buyer if things don't work out.

Here are the steps we took and how they failed:

1. I contacted the seller and had a handful of discussions with him on the phone about how to proceed. I believe he wanted to rectify all the outstanding debt, but he was in more debt than he could pay for. There was no way he could do this on his own, so we tried to involve a business mentor he met through his school.

2. the business mentor responded twice but then disappeared, likely to avoid getting involved in the mess

3. with the business mentor out of the picture, we appealed to the seller to get his parents\guardians involved... noting that they will eventually be notified and it will be worse for them to deal with this through the police or a lawyer. Seller refused

4. @longhairedboy  did an excellent teardown of a battery from the seller and explained all of laughably terrible quality issues it had. This was used throughout our communications to demonstrate the seriousness of the problem.

5. I contacted the high school where the seller attended and spoke with a guidance counselor, noting that the student started the esk8 "business" through a sharktank-esque competition at the school. I sent them all of the documentation we had. This seemed very promising at first, the GC seemed to want to help the student out of this difficult position without legal trouble. However, a week later the school and the GC notified me that it wasn't a "school-related issue" and they refused to discuss it further. They met with the seller but could not catalyze action. This was a major disappointment.

6. I wrote and sent a letter to people I believed to be the seller's guardians, but it is unclear whether it reached them or whether they were the correct party/correct address.

7. With all of those options exhausted, it seemed appropriate to take legal steps. The first step is\was to file a police report in the county where the seller resides. This is where the story ends. Unfortunately, none of the folks in the impacted group were willing to file the police report needed to make progress. Some have legit reasons why they can't (live in another country) and others are taking the loss and moving on. 

The total "damage" to the community was around $4,000 in unfulfilled sales. 

As a result, we implemented some new forum policies:

* group buys must be executed by legal adults (18+)
* group buys are not allowed to use PayPal Friends and Family payments
* group buys must be completed by a Level 3 member
* mods and forum members are now more mindful and watching out for potentially risky sellers

I think everyone here is now on the "lookout" for sellers that won't be able to fulfill their promises, and we're all a bit more skeptical of those boasting about products and services without tangible evidence of being able to follow through.

The bright side is that the seller is no longer taking part in esk8, their reputation being diminished beyond repair.

All, do not flood the forum with threats of violence. We will not enable that kind of solution. 

We tried our best to catalyze action, but nobody wanted to go through process of filing a police report. If someone wants to take a new step to legally pursue justice, please feel free to do so. 

Today is Martin Luther King Day in the United States. He was an advocate for non-violence in some of the most challenging times in our country’s history. Let that message resonate here too...

@treenutter  I don't think anyone deserves a 1000 year suspension.  Don't you think ten years is more reasonable?  The adult Alex might not be so foolish or conniving.

What?! No. And if you're friends with his punk ass your walking a thin line. If you screw over the community or think it should be taken lightly when someone does you need to go. I don't care where.

And frankly speaking, With all the time that was put into rectifying the situation by Jamie, all of you guys should have taken the time to file the police reports.

what a friggen waste of time...

There was a suggestion in your post revolving around an act of intimidation, which in some cases may infer violent intent.

Basically, please keep everything here as legal as possible guys. Anything else is only going to hinder any legal action someone else MAY wish to take against this guy.

There is no way I am friends with him.  I'm an older guy first of all, and second I don't condone theft or thieves and I hope @Alextech sits in a prison cell.

I'm just saying that a thousand years is too much punishment for anything.  Even capital murder.  Just putting it out there.

I agree with you on most of your points. Quite frankly, I find it ridiculous people use age as a viable excuse for every bad decision made. Stealing and conning people is absolutely wrong and inexcusable and people who continue doing it repeatedly will not change 10 years or even 30 years from now.

This situation is a little unique though...and maybe Jamie could do a PSA, detailing what went down with an essay and what not...
I knew of a story where someone got screwed over and something was stolen from him, and there was no legal action he could take because the crook who scammed him covered his tracks well. Instead, he posted the entirety of the story on the internet. The history of the situation is now passed around through word of mouth as well as on the internet. And quite a group of people refused to do business with the crook because of it.

[quote="treenutter, post:527, topic:25597"]
The total “damage” to the community was around $4,000 in unfulfilled sales.

As a result, we implemented some new forum policies:

group buys must be executed by legal adults (18+)
group buys are not allowed to use PayPal Friends and Family payments
group buys must be completed by a Level 3 member
mods and forum members are now more mindful and watching out for potentially risky sellers

It took so many months just to implement something very basic about selling...being at least 18 years of age. How is this going to be verified?

My question to you would be: Why would Jamie waste anymore time on it with an essay? Alextech never had anything good to offer the community anyway that they cant get themselves from Alibaba.

The people who lost money, didn't want to waste their time filing a police report or visiting him with a sheriff. So all in all, it's a loss from start to finish.

What did he personally contribute though? Nothing.

It really doesn't have to be Jamie, to be honest.

It'll be more effective if the essay/collection of posts were put and pinned on Reddit, since that has a whole lot more traffic than here.

It's only a suggestion. If anyone who is willing to do it, may do so if they wish.
Only thing is, it can't be some sort of smear-campaign-esque write up. That's going to be a legal crapstorm in and of itself.

Maybe if you manage an internet business selling 200+ items a month through either Amazon, Etsy, or Ebay. Maybe the mods can get you a pass, but you gotta have some internet representation. 


Since I'm one of the moderators on the r/esk8builders subreddit. I'm not going to be allowing the option of selling items cause each subreddit needs to have a self-policing community to protect against scams.

The tone of your comment suggests that you are unhappy with the speed of the response. However, we implemented this change months ago and posted about it. I don't think it's anyone's place to complain about speed of response here, especially if you haven't also attempted to contribute to the solution.

The mods here on the forum are volunteers and we do our best to help members make good choices with their purchasing. Despite that, we cannot arbitrate every sales interation that happens here, and we are not claiming to. We try to help, I actually care a lot about the community and I want everyone to have a good experience, but there's not "verification process" in place... If someone starts a group buy we try to review it and make sure it's legitimate. But like many things online: buyer beware. Do not send money to sources you do not trust.

My apologies, I had only read from the flagged posts down. I appreciate your efforts, however I still believe that we need someone who was personally ripped off by him to take it to the police (or something along those lines) so that he has some form of writing on his record to let people know what he's done. I'm aware that there are people here who live near his house, and although I think threatening him is a bad idea, I am not opposed to someone going over there and having a serious discussion with his parents. Would this be possible?

-I'll add, for some reason I was the only one who managed to get a full refund from this kid for a shitty spot welder that he sent me.

You can ;) . Do what I did. Graduate high school at 16 (legal age for emancipation in my state), get a job (that actually pays decent),  and ask your parents to kindly emancipate you. If they don't want to, it's not a requirement to have their permission. But if I were you, I would stay a kid for as LOOOOOOOOOONG as possible son!!! Get that allowance and build esk8 stuffz. :slight_smile:

I wouldn’t say there are no repercussions, he lost all of the money earned through sales by making poor choices and tanking his “business.” He doesn’t have a single penny of that $4000. He also burned a lot of people he once looked up to, and has no chance of reviving himself in the industry again.

But I know what you mean... it’s unfair that he was able to luck out. BTW, at any point one of his past customers could decide to report him.

Yeah that' sad. I don't understand why the mentors wouldn't want to be part of this. Didn't investors give him money for part of the "company" unless he paid them back, they are still part of the company? Unless they also gave up on getting their money back?
