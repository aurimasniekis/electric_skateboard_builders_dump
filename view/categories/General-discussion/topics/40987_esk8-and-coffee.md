So, what do guys  you do when you stop?
Like a snack break in the middle of the ride?

Why not have a fresh, perfect cup of coffee?

I made [this pot](https://www.instructables.com/id/Outdoor-3D-Printed-Coffee-Pot/) a while ago.
It is actually a more refined and repeatable version of [the original design](https://www.instructables.com/id/Espresso-on-the-Go-Perfect-Battery-Powered-Makinet/), 
which is my daily office coffee maker.

Now, the bigger version requires more power
And it’s kind of useless, 
I mean who would want to carry a large, heavy battery along with it?

Unless, you are already carrying one…or, riding one

Just plug it in to the esk8! :slight_smile: 

And enjoy a fresh, perfect cup of coffee at any stop, anywhere.

If I made that (Which is now considering it) I would use it to make ramen.:smiley:<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/6/8/68cd900ad20a0ca6e2951ae42120dc209adbcd1a.jpeg" width="225" height="225">
And maybe coffee if I run out of ramen.:wink:
This would be perfect for those people going on 100-mile rides.

@Hummie here you go: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUHVNc1hJkM
No snapping :slight_smile:
The width is close to regular boards, no discomfort.
