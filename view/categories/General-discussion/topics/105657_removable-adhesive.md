```
I have a Meepo V3 board that I have been working on for some time. I recently got my hands on some Poron XRD for free and I want to put it under my grip tape as a layer of cushion. Frankly though I am at a loss as to what I should use to affix it to the board such that I could remove it later. Ideally I would want it to work like normal grip tape, but I am open to anything at this point.
