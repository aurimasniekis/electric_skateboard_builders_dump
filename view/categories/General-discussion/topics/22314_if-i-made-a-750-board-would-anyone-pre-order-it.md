i've been pricing parts with the idea of making maybe 40-60 boards at once and doing preorders for them. 

do you think anyone would be interested in a $750 dual drive longboard? Obviously i'd have to use more "cost effective" parts and buy them in volume to get this price, and it wouldn't be the "brand-x" killer the custom builds are but people keep asking me for a more budget board and i just can't build boards in that price range that are completely custom. 

So i thought maybe i could bring my styling to some kind of short run preorder lower-price lower-performance slurpee run type board that could be built using parts from some of these vendors that have popped up recently. I could probably get boosted type polish/performance out of it with better range. 

Opinions? Thoughts? Recommendations?

Jesus 40-60 boards? That's insane. $750 sounds like a great deal considering it's an LHB and dual drive. Maybe you should start up a crowd funding campaign for this. It's sure more attractive than the dozens of Chinese rebrand kick starters out there.

I think that number of boards it pretty much the only way we can get the cost that low and still deliver something that isn't crap, yet still be able to deliver all of them within a reasonable window. 

i think it can be done with the cells i typically use with just pure VESCs ordered in bulk from macrofab, some 5055s, bestech BMSs, slower chargers, and generic chinese mounts and trucks and clone wheels on blank decks that we stylize and modify on the xcarve. I won't be pressing decks for these, it will actually be more cost effective to get a bunch of blanks. 

we're still sourcing possible parts suppliers and asking questions at this point, but if assembly and paint is the only thing we're really doing, i think we can do it and maybe even turn a profit. 

my custom boards take approximately 25 hours to build. If we can nail down a solid assembly routine, i think we can do these lower cost boards in maybe 4-6 hours total time each while building them in parrallel. 

the devil is going to be testing them. Defining tests that can be done without riding all of them will be a challenge, and of course supporting that many boards will be a challenge. 

but i'm determined to get somewhere with this esk8 business and this seems like a viable path.

I think if you're going to do it go all in.
You would need minions to assemble the boards and you just do the business stuff. plaster the net with ads and video clips. It's own website SEO fb that stuff. You can't hire your friends! You would have to fire them if they can't assemble 3 boards a day. You need people with assembly line experience.
Batches of 100 sounds more realistic to me as you really need to beat down the parts price from your suppliers to make a real business out of it.

I agree 100%. Hiring friends will be a problem unless they are as passionate about this project as you are. I would NOT pre-order it only because I have too many boards $750 seems like a great deal for a dual with the LHB slapped on it as long as you personally oversee the quality control aspect of it.

I know I would definitely buy one, and I know a lot of other people that would too. Personally I haven't managed to design a decent single drive build for under $500 (and this is with clone trucks and wheels, lipos with no BMS, etc.).   So I know for me at least, and many other local e-skaters, that a dual board finished and with laptop style charging for $750 would be a great deal

Good idea, I think it would be popular offering a start out budget board.
People want different things from a board some wana cruise along,others tear down the road at 30+mph "me" 
I think 20+mph is still plenty for beginners.
The beauty of these boards though is they can always upgrade parts the more experienced they get or when they have the cash.

ok we were spitballing and we came up with 9Ballers. 9S4P sammy 30Qs pushing twin vesc 4.12s though a bestech 9S 60amp BMS. 

probably a standard bottle nose type dh slide deck with 11 ply and an ABS box. i'd likely use black woodstain, bare edges, and have a screen burned for top side graphics. standard black grip in a cut that compliments the artwork. 

83mm wheels, 15/35 ratio, 220kv 5055 motors with some added startup boost. I think i can still get it to start from a stand still. Hell why not run it in FOC mode while we're at it. Here's what esk8 calc had to say about it:
http://calc.esk8.it/#{%22batt-type-lipo%22:0,%22batt-cells%22:9,%22motor-kv%22:220,%22system-efficiency%22:80,%22motor-pulley-teeth%22:15,%22wheel-pulley-teeth%22:35,%22wheel-size%22:83}|

i'm thinking of a flaming 9 ball on top. 

we're probably looking at a 320 watt hour pack which would give you more range than the gen 1 space cell and enough power to get you up some hills. 
 
not sure which drive train we're using yet or if we'll be fabbing our own.

that's why i have to do so many of them. There's no way in hell you could do a one off for that price. I mean that's probably a $1500 build in the garage using premium diy parts. 

all i build are one offs. That's why they're so expensive. But i'd like to bring their costs down too and this might help me do that in some way.

if i can get a large enough pre-order base, yes. i can get crazy low prices at volume. In fact a very helpful forum member just sent me some priceless info on who to get what from. Thank you, you know who you are. 

i think this industry needs to learn some shit from us. i want to bitch slap it with a flavor stick.

its already a struggle keeping up with the flood of crap out there. We need to step up our games and guid this industry like the leaders we are. we're the ones on the bleeding edge. Us. Not them. Me and you ass hats with your grossly over powered rocket sticks. They watch us and take our ideas to thier factories. That means we have all the power but they get the money.

11 ounce cans of Stella?  I think your wife is stepping on your shit bro... sounds like its cut by an ounce haha.

On a serious note, would like to see you go for this and share your story throughout.  The first step should be building one of these units and testing it to see if its actually fun or fills a hole in the market.  If there is nothing unique about it and it is more expensive than the clones, I don't *think* people are going to want to buy it just based on who's building it.  With cheaper boards, you may also be signing yourself up for a pain of supporting a high volume of newbie customers ;-)  Something to keep in mind.

Also thats going to be FUCKING expensive and if there is one mis-step (supplier of cheap shit sends you... cheap shit that doesn't work) what are your options?  Do you have to cover the build costs out of pocket (out of house?) potentially there is a huge risk here and the chinese mfg may just shrug and say "whatever, you're out 20K... what are you going to do about it"

YOLO though, so go for it man

I think they're metric ounces which must hold more alcohol because five of those and it was bed time.

You are correct about the demographics. That's one part i'm not looking forward to. 

I already have access to most of what i need to build a prototype, the trick is going to be getting motor or drive train samples.

not sure if you do yourself a favour with cheap mass market compared to exquisite high priced custom boards.

my idols are 1166 longboards in germany https://www.1166longboards.com who focus on premium decks with over the top finish, incredible veneers and perfect performance in the ldp longboarding niche!

i drool over every boards of theirs cause each one is a work of art.

then again, becoming more premium than chakas cutting edge boards, an evolve gt or the biggest dual+ boosted with extralarge battery? pretty hard I guess! if i werent so picky about so many small details id probably run any of the 3 mentioned boards. :thinking:

Since you might not be able to warranty these quite you like you can with your custom boards would you at least provide a replacement part list and useful assembly notes?

Also, that makes me think that you could add value to a collection of parts by testing them and giving your seal of approval to them in a certain configuration. That is, how do you feel about making a kit version with instructions?

that seems like a reasonable solution if the target market is diyers and tinkerers who maybe just want to start with a working unit they can mess with later. I'll hang on to that idea, thanks. 

i'd like to put a complete kit together at some point. That was one of my original goals. A 12S kit that was basically a blank dissasembled esk8 like i typically sell would be amazing. you could paint it and mod the deck and run the wires however you want.  I think the only thing holding me back there is getting it down to a decent price point using volume pricing. It would still be expensive, but not as much as one of my completes for sure because the hours involved would be a whole lot less. 

hmmm. Maybe that's the direction this should really be going. I sort of have most of what i need to do it already.

As the kit price increases so does my wariness of my own assembly abilities. If you did sell a kit for $1000, say, I'd almost rather try to talk you into building me your 10S 360Wh single for $1500 with no customization (that is, I'd tell you to just do a quality build but don't worry much about appearance and skip the high end flourishes if necessary).

But if you did a $600ish kit then I could slightly roll the dice with my own assembly abilities.

Also, if you felt really confident about this hypothetical $600 kit and you demonstrated it well with videos, photos, write-ups, maybe got a neighborhood kid to build one following your instructions (to show you don't need LHB abilities to assemble it well enough) then I'd order 2. 
One for me and the other just to help you do a bulk part order but then I'd just have you hold onto it and when it sold through your website (because many more dudes like me, just getting into this, with sufficient mechanical abilities will see, after hours of reading, this is the way to go) you could send me $600.

Both have pros and cons.

A pre built board is attractiv to more people. Esk8ters are quite a few, but builders not so much.

And also I fear that you would get swamped in a flood of emails asking for support if you go the kit route. And those countless hours will also play a role.

While I am a fan of large batteries, have you considered offering a dual drive without a battery pack?  I am sure this would reduce your costs/price further, and it would make it easier to ship to your new customers in Europe and Asia. Perhaps include an enclosure with instructions/schematics or recommendations for a lipo battery?  

It would also give you some flexibility to get creative with deck shapes, maybe offer a flexible deck? :wink:

Just some suggestions...

that's true. I would get swamped with orders. That's something i keep thinking about, and something a few people have kindly reminded me of. 

Several people have raised the point that doing a budget board could literally destroy my business if anything went wrong on a number of levels. That's true. Not being able to deliver, not being able to support, and not being able to make money on them are serious probabilities. 

Also i fear providing a quality, unassembled board as a kit would probably only be $1000 cheaper than buying one i put together. $1000 is a lot of money, but when you consider you can get a functioning board, and not a crappy one, for $1500, it makes it hard to justify a kit for people who haven't done a build before. It would be more of an advanced kit for people with skills and talent, so that wouldn't be a high volume product, would be subject to the same filters and throttles my current business benefits from,  and could potentially be doable provided i'm not building every single one of those battery pack and i can get some vendors to give me discounts in the spirit of DIYing. 

I'm setting the budget board idea aside for now. Obviously there's demand for a $750 9S dual drive but until i can get the parts cost down to less than half of that i think its dead in the water. And at that point we're talking volumes i probably can't handle. In fact i know i can't handle them now for sure. Basically if we wanted it to happen we'd have to find a manufacturer to build the whole board, fly over there so we can test their products, and by test i mean me and Jake break them all by doing what we do, slap our name on them and hope they don't catch fire. None of that sounds appealing to me. 

maybe when my shop is a little bigger and we have more access to more resources we can revisit this possibility. Right now we're in a sweet spot of low volume high margin take-my-time-and-do-them-right custom builds and i'm kind of enjoying it because its not only paying for itself but also slowly paying down the monstrous debt i incurred by starting this ridiculous hobby 3 years ago. who knows, i might actually go into the black next year. Provided i can stop constantly buying shit on amazon.

That's an idea. I've been trying to simplify the build inside the box as much as possible and wrap up the BMS, eswitch, fuse, and volt meter into the same shrinked pack, but I suppose its entirely possible though with some re-arranging of components to ship literally everything but the cells themselves and provide a spec sheet, recoomendations for securing, (silicone is amazing stuff and its cheap) and extra charge/discharge connectors for overseas orders. 

It would certainly be more cost effective than the $400 i spent shipping that red white and blue monstrocity of a crossover to the UK.

oh that can be done. I could open source my boards. I doubt i would lose any money. People come to me because they want me to build them, not because they just want a board. 

I would be willing to host an open source board project on one of my domains fi there is serious interest in that. And provide some of the content as well.

@longhairedboy  Yeh... with this I meant that perhaps more people can ''hop in'' and develop this idea further..

Heck.. if Enertion has managed to pull off a big bulk of parts from manufacturers.. why some esk8 build enthusiasts couldnt pool their resources together and also make something similar..

Though, this probably makes it clear that there needs to be some sort of community with its roles, to develeop these ideas in the proper direction.. Otherwise I might foresee nothing much will come out of it.. and it will be just way more chaotic than it should be..

Even though I think it might be hard to come to the right choices in what parts should be selected and what not.. after that someone would need to take up the role of organising all the ordering process and also manage finances.. which we still need to find the source for.. similar like you had an idea about ''pre-orders''

---
To be honest.. my vision is for a somewhat ''customizable'' board.. Where it can work similar like evolve does now, where you can switch out the tires and ''styles''

Maybe.. in the future, a more prospective idea will be to develop ''booster pack''.. so everyone can just buy the booster pack and put their own deck.. might save us at least 50usd or so on the deck alone I think :D

For an open source eboard, we have a lot of the parts already:
ESC: VESC
Motor Mounts: We could use one of the community designs, I'm also working on a spur gear direct drive.
Deck: Integrated deck I'm working on? Or maybe different options?
Battery: Open source BMS and modular packs?
Enclosure: Well yeah
Wheels & Trucks: Deal with Labeda for some custom kegel style wheels and caliber II (maybe clones or sort out deal with Caliber)

It can all be done, but it would take lots of time.

@lox897 yeh, this is what Im talking about! So far I think I have seen almost every part available on the forum or specially made by someone to make it work!

I even forgot about the @raphaelchang BMS and the further direction @JTAG took with finding manufacturers for his(?) design..

If I got something wrong, someone can correct me.. but yeah, we already have 2 BMS ''designs'' (products) which need to be further implemented.. right?

And a lot of problems seem to happen with diy / chinese bms'es these days, so using a custom made one looks like a good choice for me.. at least 'quality wise'.

We could always, maybe, ''split the final product'' and offer BMS and no BMS options, to reduce the cost, for these who choose to go without one.

---

@lox897 Idea about integrated deck does not sound bad :) im not sure who is going to lead the operation but perhaps those who have tried their luck in making one, could figure this one out too.. on how to ''expand it'' and make some sort of manufacturing batch, to make at least a dozen of them or so.

Yeh and the pulleys and mounts, like you said, we also do have.. and they have been made with different iterations over all this time..

Then it is just the battery.. motor.. remote controller we still need to decide on :D

Motor doesn't have to be anything special. Brotherhobby or Maytech or FRCH could do it. Remote would be the Arduino remote.

Integrated deck has 3 layers. The core with cutout for components (multiple veneers together. And a bottom and top of aluminium with something underneath or on top to make sure it doesn't short with components inside.

Dont know about the deck.. but yeh, anyways you got to finish that remote.. 

Then we would be a bit closer to somewhat ''finalizing'' all the details and parts.. and a further operation would be needed to put everything together etc..

I did like @JLabs motors but maybe @wmj259 could also chime in, if he still has ties to the factory where he ordered his motors..

Though.. they need to be the ''strong type'' like Turnigy's.. since Ive seen some of these poorer design motors disintegrate, like recently on picture thread, this one:

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/2/5/252d3998618f80552285f26b92131ba2810cdb37.png" width="424" height="353">

Havent seen turnigy motor witness such fate.. the only bad thing about turnigy stock motors from hobbyking, in my opinion, is their inflexible wires and general setup without hall sensors, as halls can be quite useful, I think, especially for hill and smooth acc/decc setups.

--

And yeh.. complecting parts wouldnt be the only trouble, someone would need to tune in the software side of things, for the remote, for the vesc and perhaps also for the bms system.

I am having a stab at making an integrated deck design currently but "real" (boring) work is getting in the way. My idea is a fibreglass moulded design with a core material And woven fibreglass in key areas. If it works it could be a part of the plan.<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/c/3/c353a68a0fb2a0946ba03f46ec88070ee17edfb1.JPG" width="375" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/9/9/995d3110376f61fd49dc702b52a71e9aac178446.JPG" width="375" height="500">

All the details for ordering a quantity of motors are available in the group buy I hosted. Prices are very good especially for the work and customizations they did. The shipping may look expensive but divided across all the Motors it comes out about the same price to hobbyking.com. 
If anyone's going to buy motors just give me a message so I can let them know.

I know it took quite some time to dial in all the required parameters and u had to make lots of changes on the way.. but let''s say.. if we ordered 20motors now, would that be even possible?

Minimum would be 5 for each type of motor. 
For example I would need to get 
5 Sensored 192s. I can't do 3 Sensored and 2 unsensored. 
As for build time it was around 20-30 days(my memory is little rusty on these dates, but around that time line I believe) with shipping being at most 1 week.

Yeh, if 5 is the smallest batch no problem.. sounds super good, actually..

Do you remember how they charged for shipping? I know it must be on the thread somewhere.. but im not really feeling like searching through all the posts for that..

So yeh, if 10-20motors at a time can be ordered.. that sounds good.

We would just need to count how many people would be interested, to determine the batch's size

If going for the 5065 or similar size, then yes, these can be considered. 

Though I wouldnt be as focused on motors right now.. as the rest of the electronics might bring more discussion to the table..

Remote still needs to be refined, then assembled and put inside of nice 3d printed enclosure.

Deck choices are also still plenty.. maybe @longhairedboy should lead this ''step'' as to figure out whenever it is worth it for someone to fabricate deck with integrated battery enclosures or not.. of course, some compromsies can probably be found in china and the deck's being ordered from there to bring the cost down a bit.

--

I think this is the point now when 'we' - as collective force should decide on whenever the first ''open source'' esk8 should be a budget or premium model..

If we follow what tesla is doing.. then it might as well be that first it is better to produce higher cost model, then gain some momentum (possibly some cash flow, too?) and after the first succesful batches are made, some further progress and thought can be spent on discussing the details about ''budget build''

It probably wont be a budget model also because of the dual drive, which im now seeing as mandatory if someone wants better brakes or just better performance in general..

I honestly think slow and steady is the way to go instead of going all in.

First define the system ( dual drive?  Battery?  Holow deck or enclosure etc.)

Then as a second step check the sourcing for the parts in bulk. ( inhouse on the forum, talk with manufacturers etc) 

Third, once we decided on a "shopping list" get the smalles amount of batches ASAP. Send those parts out to 5-10 trusted individuals with different skillsets and viewpoints. (experienced builders, relaxed carvers, speed demons, vecs settings tinkerers etc.) So eatch will document how they set it up. Shows the reality of it, provides all the information needed and also many conversations and you automatically build the best help desk possible. So we would have 5-10 reviews to help market the idea, meanwhile we have 5-10 beta units which help us to improve the final one, catch any errors or bad ideas and most importantly make it a reality people can check, with ride vlogs, video footage, range test etc. 

Just my few cents on it. Show them whats up. Convice them with reality and dont try to sell them a thought/idea.

[/quote]

@lox897 I also think that the first batch should be relatively small, like @Michael319 said. Though it depends on whenever it is possible to make it that small or not.

After everything has been worked out and we would know that it is possible to ''manufacture'' = assemble boards this way, then someone could take the lead and progress it further.

--

Im not sure about the kickstarter as of yet.. then the size of this whole thing would increase tremendously and the pressure to succeed would probably be a lot higher which might cause some extra stress and tension to make everything done.. dunno if that is indeed what would be needed or not.

I'm pretty sure that for 5-20 boards, the sourcing could be done only using this forum alone. If the cost would be too high to produce boards in such quantities, then other options (kickstarter / indieGoGo) might be considered..

----
Though, I think that for the first batch the main operation would still need to happen inside of usa, partly because of shipping expenses and the difficulties for a single person to ship completed battery pack overseas.. (not to mention the weight of the package and added cost of shipping once again).

Thinking from another side about this - If we can make / produce boards for ourselves in decent quality for relatively little cost compared to some higher priced commercial eboards out there.. then why it shouldnt be possible to do this in quanity of 5-10, at least for the beginning.

This probably would come to the factor of man hours spent into the process.. but this is why it would be important to cooperate and perhaps lay some of the operations in the hands of others, similar like you are now making the remote @lox897 

--

Im not really saying this will be easy as there is a lot of room for miscommunication and some errors.. but I think with a strong lead, strong center and clear idea of what needs to be achieved, this could be feasible.

just my 5-10 cents also :D

mh I was also thinking about this and im not sure what the future scenario would be like..

If @lox897 can manage to finish up his remote in the coming 2-3 months, then maybe some other 'volunteers'' can come up where to find the rest of the parts..

Then once the parts are found and some 'willing to buy participants'' are also found.. the process could begin, where someone would maybe take up the role to install the parts n such..

Though this still requires mutual trust and collaboration, communication and some sort of hierarchy I think.. so im not sure how easly it can be pulled of from 'management perspective'

It basically means we need to source internationally the people / talent, just like MiamiBoards has with their team, chaka and his people and other 'communes' who are interested in esk8.

If someone knows 3 other people in his area who are willing to take part in this, I think it can work but there still needs to be some plan and of course, willing to pay customers at the end, unless someone has large enough budget for at least 5 pre made boards.

Well true. Also it would consume alot of time.
The 5 boards are no problem in my opinion. Could easily get "rid" of them.

So basically it would end along the lines of :esk8 forum part list, sourced by members, with an installment guide. I mean if the value is great I see no point of it not workingt out.
Most builds use the same/similar motors. Battery wise 25r/30q cells are more frequent than ever. The thing that mayby got lost on me is who runs a business off that? Or did we completely go from LHB buildung boards for a great price, to essentially a "group buy price" for a complete parts list?

mh im not sure where LHB stands now.. but I think he was okay and liked the idea about organising 'budget build'' group buy or something, so there is less work on his hands.

Yeh, batteries might be the biggest and most intensive part of the build.

Kit idea is nice, actually a few people have already mentioned it.

I dunno, we would also need to make some sort of 'poll' to decide what range / power / voltage and what remotes to use for the builds... but then again we would need the 'paying parties' here, who could 'dictate' what would they like to use and for how much money.

We could, of course, make a few batches of a design we have choosen (like 25r / 30q cells) for this distance and that power and then look at how it goes (especially if you know you can easily sell a few boards just right to your friends or someone nearby)

--

Ok, to organise it in a more 'simpler terms', here is the rough setup:

**Super budget build**

Lipo batteries (6s?)
B6 50W charger
Car Esc ? (maybe better Vesc for brakes..)
Motor mount welded?
Clone flywheels
Mini remote

**Cons**: Slow charging, possibly limited speed and power, fixed trucks, hard wheels
**Pros:** Cheap, working good enough for not advanced builds

---

**Medium Grade build:**

Lipo or Li-ion
100-150W charger
Vesc
Caliber II trucks + adjustable mount
Mini remote or 3d printed sparkle / buffalo / mad monkey / wolf remote
Same or Abec wheels

**Cons:** More expensive but better performance
**Pros:** More extras

**Advanced build:**
Dual motor
Possibly with high power/ high range (18650 cells recommended)
Open choice for trucks
Dual Vesc or Vesc -X (FocBox now :D )
Good wheels
Vesc Oled remote + telemetry

**Cons:** Harder to build / complect
**Pros:** Got everything one can imagine

--

**Areas of 'hardship':**

* **Truck choice** -  mounting of motor plate, motor plate's choice

* **Programming vesc** -  acquiring Vesc, setting it up

* **Battery building** -  Cell sourcing, cell spotwelding, Soldering balance and main wires, balance / charge port installation, additional Bms / monitoring circuits, Battery status indicator hookup and installation

* **Enclosure building** - Making / ordering the box, drilling holes, fitting components, gluing components

* **Testing procedure** - Remote connected with vesc, vesc working reliably, battery connections good, battery charging normally etc

----

I would say there is a lot of human effort involved if we were to make custom 18650 batteries and then.. selling them officially would be on question mark as that is not probably going to be a certified workshop whatsoever but for 'forum use'' this might be okay, if end users know who built it and the quality and work is good.

So, at beginning to make things easier, it would probably be wise to cut all the areas where human effort and work is required.

As about motor controllers choice, then I think we need to stick with vesc to make it reliable and not cause unnecessary accidents to 1st timers because of faulty car esc brakes.

Then again, vescs need to be configured and made somewhat bulletproof, so they dont fail easily.

--

2nd opinion - someone has to develop a seperate module for car escs to modulate the brake signal.. maybe then we can save up to 40-50 eur by not going the vesc route at the beginning, since car escs work reasonably well as long as brakes are not concerned in high detail :D

originally i thought i was on to a way to bring a sub $800 board to market. I thought i had found some decent parts that would fit the bill but afte crunching the numbers more and being inundated with everything from advice to warnings to flat out "you really don't want to do that" by other people who have been in this business longer than I have and know what's realy going on, I have decided not to try to build this board. 

However.. for this open source board cause I'm willing to donate  free web hosting and pay for domain registration, and possibly some parts if I can figure out a way to not burn myself while doing it. 

I've already registered a few domains for use by the community for various things in a defensive measure against malign squatters. 

I own the esk8.build domain  and i think if somebody wanted to take it over and build something there for this project, i'd be willing to hand over the sFTP creds to it. 

I'm terrible at organizing and planning, however, so i can't take a leadership role in this. It deserves better project management than i would be able to give. But i would be willing to host it, promote it, and do write ups on it on my blog occasionally. It needs to be independant of my brand so that it doesn't look like i'm dictating what's happening, which i will not be doing.

@longhairedboy  Cool, thanks for the support!

Yeh, I think it all comes to the cost, if this matter is more carefully looked upon, peps like us who live either in US or EU cannot really bring down the wage costs either unless these are some super easy simple things to work on and which might not require lots of time or concentration to do (and which are not boring also)

So yeh, I think this is why we cannot go with car escs at all, since there are quite a few problems that might happen but then again, vesc might not be no different from config perspective but at least it wont have terrible or dangerous brakes to start with and power output can be easily modulated for the users needs.

--

@longhairedboy writing blog posts n such sounds like a very nice idea! Though, we still need to manage a 'team' for this .. and it is hard to say now whenever this is going to move in the right direction or not,.. maybe a new thread about this wouldnt bite, as not everyone is looking in this thread to find out about 'open source'' esk8 idea.

I will wait till @michichopf chops in about this one.. and then maybe create a new topic, since he seems to be the one who is also digging this idea and see that it might actually work and happen.

--

So yes, at beginning we would need:

**Mechanical part installer** (trucks, motor, wiring)

**Controller Settings specialist** (more vesc related) - (Programming, setting up vesc, checking for faults/errors in config)

**Enclosure maker / builder** (getting right dimensions, fitting components etc)

Will leave BMS / spotwelding part out of this now, it takes too much resources I think and at first it might as well be outsourced or lipos might be used to bring the cost and time spent on it down.

-----
**Then comes the 'management / organization ''part:**

.
**Product development / Finance** -  (Managing sources / parts / costs / money)

**Marketing / Customer service** - (Informing people / marketing / answering to questions )

**Logistics** - (Shipping out boards and parts )

Hey.
I completely agree with everything you said. And yes I am intrested in such an idea as this. I am a sucker for team projects.

I think that building a team who can work together in this for a few months is the biggest issue.
Getting Decks, caliber 2 trucks, motor mounts etc. for cheap should be alot simpler. Especially with the decks and trucks where we can tag along a huge buy from a longboard dealership or a group buy.
Battery packs will definetly be a headache.

But I think we can keep speculating forever. What we need is people willing to follow up on those ideas and check if they are possible and calculate cost for the first 5-10 prototypes. 
Also I think bringing as much attention as possible to this is the right way. So we should open a new Thread I think.

Mayby its a little early to get hyped up, but lets do this!  :slight_smile:

Thanks for the ideas! Honestly, there have been a few people who have been interested in ''KITS'

This way we could 'modify''the level of 'īnvolvement''they want to make an electric skateboard..

**For example, there are people who have some mechanical skills, but lack electronics skills:**

* We offer, ready made esc / battery package.

**Then, there are people who lack mechanical skills or cannot access tools:**

* We offer ready made truck + mount combination and other parts already installed.

These are the 2 most viable categories im seeing now but there might be a bit more of them.

--

Maybe, if we 'differentiate'' the product assembly this way, then it might be possible to drive the cost down or dont sell 'time' which the end user might do himself.

Some 'works'' repair just 2-3h, but when multiplied by 5x (for 5x boards, for example), it comes down to 10-15h of man hours.

I hope everyone gets my idea onto how this might follow also.

--

@michichopf Well, if it does not happen this way im pretty sure some more people will group up in real life and just launch a kickstarted.. lets hope they have enough knowledge and willingness to offer a good quality, reliable board but still decently cheap (affordable)!

===

I couldnt really start anything since im a bit far from the 'centers' of active eskating.

For europe, this might be a wider region - Uk, France, Germany or maybe Netherlands.

While For Usa, it is probably West and East coast.

Not sure about Asia, as they have plenty of products themselves and not a lot of users of our forum at least, are from there.

--

What else to add.. in the end I think it will come to finances and the interested parties..

Heck, if I had money for 2 prototype boards I would probably build them straight away..

The only problem with me is im more inclined in mountainboards :D but wouldnt mind getting involved in a small commuter build anyways and if we develop a 'box-kit'' then it wouldnt even matter as much how small or long is the deck.

--

To be honest, I heard IKEA in a similar way cut the costs down by making the end user assemble his furniture with given instructions..

Im pretty sure a lot of other companies do that now but for example I think it works quite okay (IKEA way).

How should we call the new thread?

**Build your esk8 in 3days?** :D

**Partly open source, partly forum member esk8 build project**

**Electronic Diy Kit vs Mechanical Diy Kit? Which you gonna choose?**

--

Ok jokes aside.. but I think we should focus on these 3 and see what happens...

Good news everyone! I have made zero progress on this! Isn't that exciting?

Actually I am working on this in the low priority zone, I'm trying to come up with a 12S single drive on Akashas but i need an enclosure for it. I may have to resort to sending it to our friend in peru once i get it ironed out. 

So i'm thinking a more premium last mile mall grabbing single drive: 12S3P 30Q pack, maytech Super Foc, flipsky remote, 6374 on 12mm belt, 16/32 ratio on Ahmyo Akashas all on a landyachts Dingy. 

Not for $750 though, i'm going to try and do it for just under $1000 if at all possible, hopefully right around $900

A $750 board would be essentially impossible unless i used ebay parts and I'm not doing that. 

Still working on the prototype and then i can add up the final cost of parts then check into volume discounts. It's basically going to take me forever to get this happening but its happening. 

It would look something like this, except 3P not 4P and not that motor and not that motor mount, but definitely that deck and those trucks and wheels.

Brother I think you are doing a great thing, and I am all down for this....but have you seen the specs on the new meepo 4wd pro? 850$ gets you 4wd with hill climb of 35% and speed of 30-35mph...how is anyone supposed to compete with that.... granted the battery is probbaly crap...but you will likely still get 10ish miles out of it. 
What do you think about flipsky 4.20 dual, 10s2p 30q maybe 10s3p and using hub motors? This would give you a good set up and the hub motors alone would save on parts that you would need in a belt drive...I havnt read the whole post so not sure if anyone had brought up hub motors yet.

This looks like the perfect backup to keep strapped to your backpack for those long runs or when you just don't wanna drag your monster around. Or when you've had to leave your main board at work due to rain or something. Definitely interested if this goes international! What type of wheels are we talking, 97s?

BKB is selling a dual 10S3P 30Q FSESC 4.12 for $749 though, what's the plan to beat them out?

Not saying you'd be directly competing with, I'd bet yours would be higher quality, but it would be silly not to mention it because the tayto felt pretty good when I rode on it and I can imagine it being quite a good setup as it is.

- Saw the thread title, came in here expecting some noob wanting to rebrand chinese crap.  Had the popcorns ready for the hate fest.
- OMG! Its LHB!  This is going to be amazing!
- See date: 2017...

What a wild 5 second roller coaster ride :'(

New mini board looks great though :)

Very lacking information on their site as far as I could see. No info on motor size,kv, if the mount is adjustable or charger. Couldn't find any info on their site about their company either. It looks great but the lack of info makes it a total dealbreaker for me.

Im sure they are, I just don't see how you as a company don't wanna provide your customers with the spec info. I mean, if I'm comparing different products I'll simply leave out the options without sufficient information

Or you could just ask. Boosted doesn't give you what type of battery, if motor mounts is adjustable or not.  Marketing just doesn't allot  space for specs specs. Half of the time its just for glashy flashy.
