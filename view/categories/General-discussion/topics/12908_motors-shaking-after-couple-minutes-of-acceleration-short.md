Ok, so ive been tearing apart my board all day looking for a short. i found some things that i thought could have been the problem but it didn't fix it. i cant find a short anywhere. What else should i look into. Every time i take it out it works perfect for the first little bit then starts to shutter? any ideas?

spacecell pro 4 
2x r spec
2 vesc
