```
I decided to restore my eboard and I found some problems:
one motor is spinning faster than the other one
my esc (labeled as 12s) is recognized as 8s by my computer
I can't program esc to achieve soft acceleration (alienpowersystem software)
and thread on one of my trucks disappeared 
I'll be thankful for any help <3

this one, when I bought it, it wasn't labeled as car esc (and it's in "Ev esc" category one the website)

i have not used that esc, but from the website, i think you should try to update firmware/configure it/ etc.

I did all of that but nothing helps. APS agreed to exchange my used esc for this one:
http://alienpowersystem.com/shop/esc/alien-120a-2-12s-v4-factory-esc-hv-twin/
and I think I'm gonna do that, this esc is recommended for EV systems so it should be better than previous one
