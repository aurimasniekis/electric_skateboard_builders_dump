I was wondering if it's recommended to use locktite to keep the screws into my eclosure. Can locktite screws be unscrewed later on for access? I've had to fall out from vibrations.

Blue loctite is what are you looking for
Red loctite you will need heat to unscrew later on

Yes always use loctite. 243 loctite is a medium hold loctite that allows bolts and screws to be removed with just hand tools and without heat.

I use a small dab of blue loctite. 
Just stops them vibrating out.
