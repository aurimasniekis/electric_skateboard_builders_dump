G'day all,
Pretty much, here's the situation. I live in sydney Australia and i have a diy board which i love. Its got 4 turnigy nano tech batteries on board which are each ~84wh.
Sometime this year i wanna take my board to Germany. now the thing is that my batteries can be removed from my enclosure so that they are all separate. So i should be able to travel with these....right?

My question here is, has anyone travelled internationally with their builds and if so did you need to sign any prior forms or what was the process to get your board on the plane? (Also which route and what airline). Do you box up the board, check it in and take the batteries on board with you or whats the go? 
Ik ik long ass question but any helps appreciated

you should be all good. 

pack the batts as per regs and carry in your hand luggage and put the board in checked in baggage

but rules change regularly and quickly hence the "should"

it might be worth printing that out to take with you in case you encounter a difficult person at security, the level of competency and fuckery vary widely from country to country and various airports

The only thing I can recommend you, pack your motors in your hand luggage too.
I was flying once with two outrunner in my checked in bag and I had to come to the luggage after check (donâ€™t know how itâ€™s called ðŸ˜…)
I needed to unpack everything and show what it is. I had enough time and it was just a small airport, so no issues after, but if you check in motors, be prepared that they will call you out because of it.

Letâ€™s say if itâ€™s a good security control I would also look a bit closer if I see a big round thing with massive copper windings on the x-ray ðŸ˜‚
Itâ€™s totally fine to fly with, they just want to know what it is.
If you fly from Germany keep your ears open for:
Herr Mathias bitte zur GepÃ¤cknachkontrolle kommen!

I didn't fly with batteries but I took my non powered board. I just wrapped it in ton on bubble wrap and checked it in sports baggage. Arrived without problems. I took 2x 3a5s lipos in hand luggage and no problem. But I recommend discharging them to store levels and shrink wrap the connectors individually

should be pretty easy, will use balance connectors going to the BMS so it's nice and easy to pull out the packs. Should also save a little bit of weight compared with li-ion cells

What about bigger battery packs like 500Wh and let it go in non-hand luggage?

Or what if I take only battery pack into hand luggage and put on it a professional looking label saying 50Wh? xD

those packs or cells that took down that aircraft were professionally built

are your packs certified? i.e. had drop and pressure testing done?

Also Iâ€™m not retarded, would only bring pack that I know is safely build.

There's no 100% security when dealing with batterys.. If you are on an airplane you are not only risking your live but the lives of hundres of people  :slight_smile:

If itâ€™s discharged then it doesnâ€™t even matter if pro or noob built

In my opinion, they still have enough energy to blow up an airplane.. You know pressure loss and so on :slight_smile:

oh and BTW the UK CAA are getting really heavy, the penalty for not working within the rules:
 The penalties for non-compliance can be severe â€“  an unlimited fine, sentenced to two years in prison, or both

I can only assume other countries civil aviation authorities are doing the same

Regulations are never enough anyway, some dude can just bring a faulty e-cig and burn entire plane.
[/quote]
I think you are missing the whole point of the regs.

The idea is to keep the amount of lithium small enough to be able to deal with in flight and in a place where the fire can be dealt with, i.e. in the cabin not the hold

Ok so not a plane, then just courier?

you can get a big pack on a plane, just not a passenger plane. needs to cargo only aircraft, declared, packed to UN standards and shipped and signed off by someone with a hazardous goods certificate

If itâ€™s discharged itâ€™s just like carrying a bottle of vodka, nothing will hapen without the lighter.

I don't think that is the case. just do a quick google search of lipo fires and a lot of people are reporting fires due to under-discharging packs

It's against the law, end of discussion. Do it and get fined/imprisoned if you wish but Luke is 100% correct.

One big thing you miss.
Not only the fire is dangerous, also the smoke which comes out of the cells when they short.
Even if you discharge them to 3v.
I had a LiIon fire in my flat and i can say you it takes exactly 30sec till a 35sqm room is filled with smoke. 
If thatâ€™s happening in a plane where you have very restricted ventilation I donâ€™t want to imagine how it would end.

mate chill tf out. it wasn't your English. its your persistence that doing something illegal will be all fine and dandy. Discharging to 3vpc doesn't magically reduce the amount of lithium in a battery. all you need is a small indent in the cell or a tiny short and it'll go up in flames.

on this forum, don't try to start shit. thank you

I've read in places it's a good practice to call up your airline and see how they handle dangerous goods, as each airline has certain internal procedures and guidelines that can be followed to make things easier and safer @mynamesmatt
