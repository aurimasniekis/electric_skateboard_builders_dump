I have here a CAD design made by Dominic Nocon. 

I have measured the mount in CAD and found that the bracket measures 31mm for the screw holes near the motor to the center of each slot. The mount was originally designed for a 25mm bolt measurement (SK3 280kv 5055). I am certain this mount works for a 25mm motor because the builder of the mount said so. So my question is.... Will this mount work for a 32mm SK3 190kv motor without being altered???
