I have a 10s5p battery with a 6374 192kv motor. I took it out last night and it went plenty fast. Took it inside and looked at the vesc software and I am guessing it somehow reset everything. My motor settings are max: 70A, min: -60A, Battery max is 40A and min is -12A. The voltages are 34, and 31. Ive spent all day trying to figure this out and can't.

This is the remote settings: ![2019-03-06|690x387](upload://wc5VJLaUaxvElpeM3eDSkzl0jtv.jpeg)

Is your battery charged? You can check the voltage in Vesc tool:

Well if your cutoff voltage is 31V, and you're getting 30.9V from your battery, then it seems like you're out of power :smiley:

Charge up your battery, it should be 42.0V when fully charged :slight_smile:

Oh maybe thats why, I charged it for about half an hour just to test if it was the charger and it didn't do anything. But this brings me to another conclusion, my LED always states that my battery is at 100%

Yeah you have the same issue I did. You got the wrong lcd display / you have it programmed wrong

Not sure which one you have, and if I did, I wouldn't be much help anyways. What I did was swap the reader over to volts and then just got used to reading it as 42v is topped off, and 30 is lowest I would ever go

Make sure the charger isnt covered, they get kinda hot

On the back is a micro switch.  Press it and it will allow you to set the series count of your battery.  ie 10s.  Then you can see where you are.

Thanks a ton man! It showed 2%, then 100% and then 99% and now it still says 100% but i'll keep on fiddling with it to try and figure it out. I really appreciate it though. I hope my battery was just out and that is why I was having a really weak motor originally

At 30v it should be reading the 2% mark which is why the board was not moving.  Get it set and hopefully everything is hunky dory.  Remember the 10s should read 42v on max charge.
Don't let the battery get that low again either.  If it gets too low you will struggle to charge it with a 2a charger and it can get damaged.  Good luck!

Adding to this. When I let my battery get that low, my BMS decided it's not worth charging. So I would plug my charger in, it turns green instantly, and the pack stayed "dead".

Ended up having to bypass the bms and charge direct into the discharge lead for an hour before swapping back to using the bms to balance out and finish the charge. Checked the specsheet for my bms and sure enough, this cheap chinese bit of junk won't charge my battery if the cells drop below 3.3v (was at 3v, yea I know but I wasn't about to push home)

Everything is fine now, but if your charger light isn't turning red, try bypassing the bms for a bit.

What do you guys recommend then for complete cutoff voltage? Looking at graphs of 30Q discharge it would seem that 3.1V would be a good point to stop. (Many on this forum use 3.2V)

Thats a preference thing.  the higher the safer and better for the battery but how often do you run your board till it stops?  I don't personally.  Battery anxiety is a real thing. lol

So I run charge only bms. (Hence the 2 output options) Since you have charge/discharge on the same connector I would just unplug the battery to bms connection and send the charger power direct into the battery. Bms would be disconnected at this time.

Looks like the red (assuming positive) wire of the battery is connected directly to the cells, so it's the thick black wire (assuming negative) that is going through the BMS. You'd have to solder the 2 thick black wires together temporarily to charge your battery, but I'm not sure if it's safe to leave everything else in place while you do that. Someone more experienced with BMSs and this scenario should step in and guide you. (i.e., don't take my word for it, wait for someone else to chime in as well.)

So in that last picture it is actually after I have soldered the thick wire. The thick wire is the boards power, where the thin wire is the charging cable. I disconnected both of those from the bms and connected them directly to the other side and it seemed to work but now the charger is showing green as if it is fully charged again

So when I get on the board and try it, it says 100% before I accelerate, but once I begin the battery percentage continuously goes down to ~5% within about 5-10 seconds. Does this sound like the same battery problem to you?

I'm doing my best here my friend.  You could have some out of whack cells.  I would leave it on charge for a few more hours or overnight.  Do this outside of your house.  Can't be too careful but with a 2a charger when you leave it on it will slowly balance the cells via the bms even if its green.
I think you over discharged it.  What is the battery?  25r 30q?

@buildityourself Do you have a voltage meter? If yes can you check the voltage of the battery leads going to the bms. The the lead from the bms to the discharge plug. Also check each cell voltage.

More or less there then.  You could check the p groups but thats not enough of a drop to really worry.   Put it back together and have a ride.  Check the voltage against the meter when you get back.  Did you get the meter working?

I know flipsky VESCs have had issues with reading voltages, what brand of VESC do you have?

I think i remember you talking about having a TB VESC, which of the (probably) hundreds if not thousand units sold, hasnt had a track record of reading voltages incorrectly... :thinking:

You can extremely carefully check the voltage with a meter at the xt connector. 
 
_Disclaimer_
I have killed 2 multi meters doing this so now I do this.

Best to have a male pigtail connected to a meter and then plug it in. I have a set of leads with crocodile clips soldered on and after I clip them to the pigtail I insulate with electrical tape to be safe.

@dareno @Sn4pz Sorry to waste everybody's time and energy but I found the solution... and it was a really stupid mistake. I think the biggest factor was the fact that my enclosure did not allow the XT90 loop key to fit all the way together. After a long test the loopkey smoked and smelled so I looked it up and it just needed to be fully inserted to get the full power going. I feel dumb. But happy. But dumb.
