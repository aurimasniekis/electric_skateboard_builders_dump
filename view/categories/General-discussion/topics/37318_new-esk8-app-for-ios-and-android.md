I work as a software/app developer and commute to work everyday on my electric skateboard. So I decided I would make my own app that connects using the HM-10 bluetooth module. I'm almost ready to release it on Android and IOS, but before I do, I would like some feedback on the design and what features anyone else would like.

Currently Features:

- Bluetooth Connectivity
- Spotify Integration
- Trip Tracker
- Statistics
- Real Time Data

nice, geotracking is nice. when u say stats, does that include metrics coming off the vesc? imnusing @Ackmaniac's android app, it's awesome with the video overlay but it would be nice to have stats over time like metr.at

I'd be happy to test it for you, I'm in software too

Yes, the metrics are coming from the vesc, but also logging that data and providing historical stats as well. Ill for sure look into the video overlay.

That seems a cool app !
But it's a shame that developpers work on their own side instead of putting effort together.
"If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together"

I can't imagine all these talents pushing in the same way and offering (even selling) a amazing freaky crazy app ! :slight_smile:
The dream would be to have a social network connected to this app for sharing ride data, pictures, and so on. :heart_eyes:

Apple watch/smart watch support at some point? These apps for our phones are really awesome. The only problem I see is that our always bigger and bigger phones are a bit inconvenient to hold while riding. This is where the smart watches come in imho.

A screen with enough info like battery % or voltage, VESC temp, speed and distance would totally suffice. No more like 3 or 4 data so it stays simple yet informative.

A cool watch app would intrigue me to gladly pay for the app/work or even donate. ;)

Brad, that looks next level, man!
So sick!

In general, please make sure that the app "always" stays connected to the gps. So we can easily turn off the screen, put the phone in our jackets and not have to worry about if it tracks properly.

That map underlay will be dynamic as you ride? Very nice!

Metric/imperial option?

Keep up the good work, man! Really loving it so far. 
If you need a beta tester for the iWatch app, let me know! I'll gladly test the stuff out. :thumbsup:

I have some bluetooth modules on all my board and ride 20 km a day. I can be in the beta test if u like. 

How works the odometer ? Do u have to record to add ? Or it does it by itself ?

If there are hall sensors it can be calculated and if no hall sensors GPS will be used. Odometer will be editable if using an existing board or if you rode without tracking. Odometer essentially adds every tracked ride into one metric. I believe the RPM can also be estimated using the Vesc data, I will look into this.

I can definitely understand that point of view. I'm 100% for opensource projects. It's the main reason I got into programming. Sometimes it's smart choice to get the initial kinks worked out before opening up to the public though. Guess we'll see which way this project goes in time. :)

Im assuming future esk8 companies will use this app code for their own branded app. If I use the AGPL license then they would be required to also open source. Although I would like them to do that, I don't think they would. My goal here is to create a powerful and sleek app for the DIY community, but if it can also benefit new esk8 startups and esk8ers that purchase ready to ride boards then I would prefer that. It comes down to which license puts this app in the most hands?

Essentially you will just purchase the HM-10 Bluetooth module, connect it to your VESC or FOCBOX and the app will show a list of available devices, you select the device and voila the app pulls the realtime data and displays it.

There are others, but I will make a video on where to buy the module, how to solder the connection, how to plug into ESC, what settings you will need to change in BLDC app, and setting up in app.

Referencing this to show the various libraries: https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=vesc

I have written a few apps in Ionic and also used their web service. It's a very nice codebase and service, but I find the React Native performance slightly ahead for more complicated apps. Most of the projects I work on request React Native so I'm proficient and have modules already written. Either way I like both because its all javascript.

not sure if this has been covered...I'm using two HM10s one on each FocBox due to split PPM vs CANBUS. The app I'm using now doesn't seem to play nicely, I'm only able to connect to one module and unable to switch to the other. might be an app issue since there are no other HM10 to select. hopefully this is something your app would accommodate.

I have to run split ppm, I've had one vesc fail on me twice having master and slave would be problematic if it happens again

There is a command for the HM-10 module that allows for name change. If you have an Arduino you can mess around with it, explained here http://www.martyncurrey.com/hm-10-bluetooth-4ble-modules/ 

> Change the name using AT+NAME. Later I will be using 2 HM-10s and changing the names will help identify which is which. As you can see from the below I have changed the name to HMsoft-38A3. The “38A3″ are the last 4 digits of the mac address.

I will see if I can work in the name change within the app.

Please see if you can connect to two HM-10s each with it's own vesc using split ppm. I got the problem again where only one module can be seen and the other doesn't connect. I think both connected only once or twice during my test. I've close up my enclosure for now, I just have one module to the new replacement vesc since I want to make sure it has no faults (trying to determine if it was a faulty focbox or motor problem.) Thanks for your effort in an awesome app!

So from what I'm reading it seems that developers want to get in on the development and the community wants it to be community built which I'm all for. So what I'm going to do is put up a portion of my codebase up in Github and see what happens. I also secured esk8app.com for information pertaining to the app as well as links to each app store. Ill put up the basic framework with some tasks I haven't had time to work on. 

I'll put some paint on the canvas and we will see if the community can create a masterpiece. Ill have it up by Sunday.

I had severe issues because React is actually nonfunctional if you don't have WiFi at home.  I have no need for it, I use Gigabit Fiber w/ Ethernet and also Cellular.  So until I get a wireless router or they fix React, I haven't been allowed to work on it apparently.  It was a rude surprise, and fixing React isn't high on my priority list.  Typically, I use Ionic, which is the same thing, except Google brand instead of Facebook brand.  React would be fine though.  If it was functional.  It's not.

Xcode is not even an option that I would consider.

There is another framework called Xamarin as well.  It's Microsoft brand.  Apple doesn't have one.

I don't really understand how can React be an issue here. React is a framework, it does what you tell it to do. In React Native, all the resources are embedded within the app. I don't get why you would absolutely need a fast wifi connection to make it work properly ?

@ZackoryCramer I believe @b264 is talking about React Native, a way to make multi-os apps (iOS and Android) using React.

Being native, you have to test it on a handset.  It communicates to the handset over the local network only and can't be coerced to just use the internet or IP addresses or DNS.  So you can't run the application on your phone to test it without being on the same router as your computer.  Which I don't have my house set up that way.  And frankly, it shouldn't matter because, you know, they way the internet works and stuff...

So, it's a flaw in the framework.  If you fix the framework, I will gladly help with this.  Or if you want to come rewire my house and put a router in.  I just use gigabit Ethernet and Cellular.  Which means my phone and my computer are on two different sub-networks, but both are connected to the internet.

No other frameworks have this problem except React Native, which is the one Brad chose to use.

Got it, that makes sense. This is only for testing or debugging though, that's why I didn't understand.
How does Xamarin or Ionic handles that then ? Plug your phone in via USB ?

They use the internet and IP addresses / DNS lookups..

instead of, for example, [http://localhost:5600](http://localhost:5600) or [ws://192.168.1.6:80](ws://192.168.1.6:80) or something like that

So some big news coming!!! Finally got some time to work on the app and major progress has been made. Will update soon! ;)

Essentially the main portion of sending and receiving data from the vesc to the app via an hm-10 ble module is complete. Im getting the full set of data and have displayed it on the app in real time. Majority of the design to screens is complete. 

I am now testing the conversion functions to make sure when its say "20mph", it really is. Anyway just wanted to let everyone know things are going well and hope to have some screenshots available soon.

Plans for a Test Flight Beta?

I remember getting pretty excited when I saw this thread pop up. particularly for the UX deign which isn't the forte' of the DIY community. Unfortunately, 'Xmatic' stole that first to market thunder from you a little. 
What will differentiate your application now? 
I suppose 'free' is a big attractor.

Can you speak to Apple Watch compatibility/function? 
I suppose this is going to be the next point of differentiation between these apps.
I would pay handsomely for any good app, but particularly an app that runs directly off the watch independent of phone

## \#213 Posted by: bradrisse Posted at: 2018-09-08T03:33:05.337Z Reads: 251

One of the top factors is UI/UX, yes an app may look similar but how does it feel and how do you interact with it. Are the animations smooth? Does it work flawlessly? Is it intuitive? These are the things I keep in mind while developing. Second it will be free and always free without ads of any sort. Third it will be available simultaneously on IOS and Android with the exact same experience. This is a big one for me because an overwhelming majority of mobile phones around the world use Android and it simply isn't fair to create an app exclusively to IOS.

There will be a private and public beta. It is currently in alpha getting all the kinks knocked out. 

An app the runs on the watch independently of the phone might be problematic. I won't know what the hurdles may be for that yet as I'm concentrating on the mobile phone currently. 

Anyway competition is great, it pushes new and exciting features and gives users to pick the app they enjoy the most. Obviously I hope to give a great experience that is better than others.

Like the many that came before me I'm eager to see this come to fruition. I saw a lot of requests to make this a community driving project which sounded awesome, I kept waiting to read the next post saying it was open to all devs but never happened. I can only speculate as to why it was kept closed which is 100% ok but as someone who is now beyond excited to see this available to everyone its hard not to wish it was made open source to expedite the completion of work. I'm sure @bradrisse has invested a considerable amount of time and money into developing this with his express desire to make it free to all is incredible. At this time all I can do is say thank you for your work and dedication the the community. I look forward to seeing this become available for testing. If there is room for additional beta testers please keep me in mind :)
