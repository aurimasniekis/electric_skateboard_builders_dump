It seems like lots of forum members have store fronts as well on the internet. I frequently find a site (or see someone else link to one) and then see a comment that "Oh yeah, that's @xxxx's store...) but wanted to suggest a post (maybe a sticky) that compiles and lists them all so a new member knows who on the forum is a seller and what site belongs to whom. 

- just a .02 idea

For example I know that 
DyIElectricSkateboard = @torqueboards
And
Enertion = @onloop

Maybe include if they are US/UK as well?

It would even give those members who frequently sell components but don't have a site to list themselves somewhere.

Off the top of my head
http://www.ollinboardcompany.com is @chaka 
https://longhairedboy.com is @longhairedboy 
 https://goaxle.com is @zmoney
https://psychotiller.com is @psychotiller
http://www.trampaboards.com is @trampa
 
And there's a few users who represent "larger" businesses (like from some of the prebuilt boards, Chinese manufacturers like Maytech, etc). I'd have search around a bit more cause I don't remember who they are.

It's a decent start.
I have seen posts from commercial builders like @Landwheel as well and I think those should be included. Kind of a single-post virtual mall that only sells esk8's and related parts.
