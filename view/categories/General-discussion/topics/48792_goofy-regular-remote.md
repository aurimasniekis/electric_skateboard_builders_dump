I've been watching some electric skateboard videos recently and noticed that riders usually hold their remote with the hand opposite their lead foot -  goofy holds remote with left hand, regular holds remote with right hand, but I ride goofy and hold the remote with my right hand. Does it make a difference? Are there any disadvantages to doing this? Anybody else ride like this?

I had an accident a few couple weeks back and had a hairline fracture on my left wrist. I know safety gears have the most impact when it comes to outcomes of accidents (yes, I was wearing a helmet, knee pads, and elbow pads) but I just can't help and wonder whether where I held the remote could also have had any effect on the outcome of the accident.

Just feels more natural in my opinion.

But it might, but i hold the remote in my stronger hand so it would only be a downside for me when it comes to a crash.

Iâ€™m goofy, hold the remote in my right hand, wear a watch in my right hand and fire a bow left handed but am right handed. 
So there.

I ride like you too. Goofy + right hand remote.

I think it comes from using an ultra sensitive trigger remote in my first build and not being able to be so accurate and tentative with my left hand.... ðŸ˜•

I was thinking the same thing. When I crashed, if I've used my right arm first to support the tuck & roll, I might not have had an injury on my left wrist (given my right hand is stronger and more developed for having had had a lot of uhmm... training and uhm... exercise since I discovered wiggly lines from scrambled cable tv signals).

I think people use that hand which feels natural. I ride goofy and hold remote in my right hand because I'm right-handed. I would probably kill myself with the left hand because it's so retarded what comes to precise movements.

I used to ride with the remote in my back hand, then I broke my wrist and while the cast was still on I was forced to switch hand. It didn't take more than 2 minutes to feel natural again. Now I'm pretty much ambidextrous.

I ride goofy and use right hand for remote, I had a 16mph fall about 2 months ago I was using meepo style remote and holding it fist like when i landed, my pinky finger took a fair impact along with the size of that hand I def. think this would have been less if I was using my trailing hand for remote.

I wear gloves with puck now all the time and that dam remote is getting treated like a puck in future :)

I get the throttle where i want it, engage cruise control, then go into a tuck and just clench the remote between my buttocks. That way i have both hands free to make very rude gestures to everyone around me.

 i'm about to sell a book full of jokes, but i was sitting the entire time i wrote them so i don't know if any of them count. 

Maybe my next book will be filled with banter written from a more vertical position.

My kid rides both ways, when he rides goofy I tease him about which personality is riding today :slight_smile:.

I ride goofy with the remote in my left hand. I write, paint and eat with my left hand. Sports etc are right-handed. I blame a freak accident on the monkey bars when I was really young for the mutation :rofl:

Isn't riding goofy the best?  In America, riding on the streets, you ride on the right side of the road, close to the curb.  Goofy allows you to face the road, and pay attention to traffic and stuff.  Regular-footed folks have their backs towards the road, how do they even see anything at all?

Not if the bike lane is on the left like what we have in NYC.
