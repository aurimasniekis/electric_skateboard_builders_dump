Well that time isn't here yet, but it will be in a few hours! Unfortunately I'm busy tomorrow and won't get a chance to ride, but I am starting this topic in hopes that others can post pics and videos of what they did with their boards! Have fun, post away, and happy go-skateboarding day!!! :grinning:
