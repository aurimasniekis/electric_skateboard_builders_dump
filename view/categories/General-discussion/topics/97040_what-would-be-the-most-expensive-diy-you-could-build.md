man i don't know. i think i would make multiple builds instead of one thiccc board.
i'd make a trampa with quad geardrive and give it some of those steering dampeners. i'd also make a few overpowered streetboards bioboars style, and a very slick stealthy streetboard. with like an integrated carbonfiber enclosure and quad directdrive.

basically, if money isn't an issue... 4-wheel drive

You need 4 wheels hub drive or high gearing pneumatic wheels with massive battery discharge. That alone will give you massive boost in speed.

I want a 4wd 80100 motor board. 14s16p battery. Dualy tires front and back for traction, they need to be 12in. Custom built carbon deck, milled aluminum battery and esc enclosures, gear drive. All metal would be red anodized. I think 24kw should be enough for small hills..,.

A trampa holypro deck and full sized trampa trucks
9 inch wheels
2x 80100 motors
E-Toxx helical gear drive
Bottom mounted 12S6P 20700 pack

Would definitely not make just one board tho, would also build a street board with direct drives and 110mm wheels and a 12s4p battery.

Are you really the one to be calling other people's questions stupid?

You could easily eliminate at least 60% of your questions by simply searching.

First I would have several board for different occasions 

But the star of the show would be a 4WD, probably with a Trampa deck, custom made direct drive for dead silent cruising through the woods using these monster but not insanely huge tire Iâ€™ve found on Ali and battery for long journeys, 100+km of heavy ridding, maybe part of that on a trailer or battery backpack

Nope kiddo.

I see you responding in so much topics. And most off the time I just scroll over your stupid questions or messages...

Not each topic has to be serious. otherwise this forum would be very boring.

Please put it in your build :grin:

For me the tire size doesn't make sense, 9-4.00-4 should be 9" diameter no? 228mm, but them there is a picture of the guy measuring it as 190mm

It looks like it would fit extended mountainboard hubs for 8" tires, as internal diameter is about 94mm.
Unfortunately my hubs fit tires with 100-102mm internal diameter(real 4") .However for this price those shoes are a blast, especially for sand or snow.
