Just curious, I've been having a long back and forth discussion on Facebook about kicktails. I didn't think it was a big deal but someone mentioned me having wheelbite since my wheels are so big. I've never had that issue so I mentioned that it may have something to do with me riding my trucks kind of tight and using the kick tail to turn.

Basically he's been trying to suggest I widen my wheel base, install the trucks closer to the edge of the board and start carving... And that there's no point in having a kicktail because turning on a longboard is so easy. I'm used to having kicktails, never was a long boarder so that's what I'm used to. People are still commenting on the post going back and forth lol. All I did was post my pony rainbow esk8

Just do you, some folks will argue a topic because they know one thing and act like they know everything.  I personally don't use a kicktail, but I know a lot of people that do.

Kicktails are purely a personal choice. I prefer a deck with no kicktail though the option to do wheelies is an option.

Since I grew up skateboarding kicktail is a must or it's not a skateboard. :wink:

Going round real tight corners, going down curbs, picking up your board etc, wouldn't be the same without the tail.

I ride 99% with my S2 bindings (i.e no kicktails) so I just use kicktails on one of my builds to do some little tricks for the fun of it. So I would say that it really depends on your riding style. There's no good or bad choice. One of the main functionality (added to the quick turn) of a tail in skateboarding it popping ollies... which is not really something people do with average 6kg esk8 boards.

You're a skater, and your taking to an audience that traditionally does not relate to being skaters. So we are trying to bridge these exact divides. To you or I a kicktail is necessary because we actually use them, when they are gone we feel naked and alone...but to a longboarder or eskater they are foreign, like those giant tires to us...explain to them how you use it and how you feel about them and why...and they can learn to use one too, or choose not too, but putting people down, from either side is ignorant and we need to come to an understanding based on things better than ignorance and preference and opinion..there's function here, it can be talked about and measured...without a kicktail I cannot make the skateboard do certain things and it frustrates me to no end, while someone who has never learned to use one would never notice any difference..these are interesting times we live in when an feature invented in the 1960's comes back under review after being adopted and integrated for so long...

this is pretty much skateboard vs longboard.

skateboarders use the kicktail for tricks and sharp turns.
long boarders just turn...and use slides instead...
but some longboards have tails and double tails now too.

its riding style.

I grew up steet skating so a kick tail is a must for me. Cant imagine not having one, makes me feel out of place. Thats just my style. 

You can always use a deck like a bustin maestro. Has small kicktails with carving possibilities.

I belive "longboarding" doesn't exist, because its all "skateboarding" some are just longer than others. the longboarding you knew of has changed into a hybrid, embracing everything in every form before it in order to save itself from a dying market. I personally love studying all the different forms of skating and why things are the way they are, and longboarding is a fiction, unless you call it a group of skateboarding forms/genres which includes DH, FR, LDP, Dancing, tech sliding, skogging and many others, and then you can see how the term loses all meaning...so let's stop with the camps, there is no longboarders and shortboarders, there's actually about 40 different forms of skating all with specifically different names and setups and styles, they each have a name, call them that instead of longboard or skateboard..don't overly simplify it that way, or if you do, call it ALL skateboarding including electrics, cus that's what they are..I have more longboards with a kicktail than not and the last time I raced DH, the kid who won had a chopped tiny penny board with trucks from 1979...so all bets are off..a kicktail is a worthy and functional addition to any skateboard and not knowing how to use one is never an excuse. Why do tech slide skateboard all have kicktails if the form of skating "tech sliding" doesn't involve ollies, kick turns, or anything that uses them?

I agree longboarding is skateboarding. but skateboarding can be longboarding too.
yes its the same. but its not! and calling everything skateboarding makes more confusion.

Longboards have become a more general group than skateboards. 
where as skateboarding has become a crazy narrow park/trick thing.

and as for tech slides, thats more of a hybrid practice trick thing. the short wheelbase on a popsicle makes slides and spins easier...

boards > (surf, skate, push, esk8, snow, snowskate, skiboard... etc )

But actually, when longboarding grew big, it got a whole new audience, ie a totally new type of people that were riding those boards. The skateboarding culture was different (at least the one I grew up in around the mid 80s) than what came with longboarding. This latter was more a (hipster) transportation device and many of those that used longboards had never skated before and were not even familiar with the culture, all the (iconic) riders aso. To many ppl the longboard became somewhat of an accessory, something I never experienced with skateboarding.

Im not saying that's bad, but to me that was very weird at the time. I couldn't grasp the fact that people used these silly looking boards but were so unfamiliar with skateboarding. 

And never would have have thought that I too would one day get my own longboard... (although I believe my board would be considered a hybrid?)

I thought this was a pretty cool trick/longboard video. Like the ultimate hybrid between longboarding and skateboarding. Same brand deck I have but mine is smaller. It'd crazy that he can do those tricks with such a large board. I'm assuming not too many people do it though.

See there you go trying to call what you have a longboard and confusing yourself, lol. I would just use a more specific name, I prefer hybrid for my 34-36inch double or single kick tail hybrid longboards..I can ollie them, I can ride a bowl on them and then take the same board and bomb a hill at 40mph, so yeah, they are truly hybrids now if you can set one up just right for all occasions, and that's exactly why I think "longboard" is a useless word now, when you tell me you longboard, what am I suppose to picture or assume you actually do? bomb hills? tech slide? LDP? surfskate? well let's take a look at surfskating because it lives in the "longboarding genre right? I mean Carver is a longboarder company in all the longborder mags right, not the skate rags? So why is it that they all are shorter and have even smaller wheel bases than a normal park skateboard? they also all have kicktails, lol, and yet their not made for ollies or kick turns, what gives? Because they use a softer and larger longaboard wheel they are now longboards? NO dude, we had giant soft wheels before "longboarding" was even an industry coming to being in the 1990's, it makes no sense to someone my age who has been watching it all for so long. Oh and that's another thing, we never use to call it park skating, it was just skating cus that's all there was..but I'm cool with calling it park skating now that there's so many other kinds it stands next too, but I'll be damned if I sit here and let skateboarders and longboarders square off like they are in some sort of gang or camp when they are not, they are just ignorant to all the things..lol


"Hey those are those stupid reverse longboarding trucks dude, you should get some real trucks.."

Reply: "No actually they are a reverse kingpin truck, yes commonly used on what you may call a longboard but in reality they are downhill skateboards and the trucks are to avoid speed wobbles. Traditionally a "longboard would have a traditional kingpin truck as it's long wheel base does the same thing, and they have been around since the 1950's"

"All those guys do is roll around the skatepark and do flippy ollie tricks and smoke weed all day"

Reply: "Well actually doing a kickflip or even just an ollie is very hard, they are actually practicing or drilling their muscle memory in order to do stunts or tricks in the name of showing off and being cool, skateboarding is about style and chicks dig stunts dude, duh!"

"Longboarders are just commuters who like to look pretty while mall grabbing their matching longboard and walking though the food court"

Reply: "Well actually longboarding includes downhill which is just about the scariest and craziest thing you can do on a skateboard so I wouldn't put them all down when their balls are big enough to crush your car"

"Skateboarders are haters, just because they can do an ollie they think they can hate on electrics and call us cheaters for not pushing"

Reply: "Well yes, we are cheaters, so embrace it and be proud of it, like a skater who can do an ollie, stand up for yourself and your passion like a skater. And frankly, doing an ollie or 360 flip is no easy task, how about giving them some props for their time and effort to be good at what they love the way you work hard at what you do too? now shake hands, shut up and let's go shred@!!!"



If the subject of kicktails brings about divide, then we have more serious issues than I thought..

This one was more my style. Downhill is insane. It reminds me of my first time trying to bomb a hill. It was super steep and I was  of course on a regular skateboard. I fell so hard and just rolled lol. I'll never forget that. Maybe that's when I shouldve taken up longboarding about 20 years ago lol

They do take something away though. If you have a kicktail, you can't tow your board by the front truck suitcase style. 

Most of my other (non-powered) boards have a kicktail. But you lose a lot of functionality once your board starts getting so heavy. Kickturns and wheelies, sure. But it's not like you're going to be ollieing a 20lb+ board. And slamming the nose down is bad for the electronics

I'd rather lose the kicktail than have to carry around my electric skateboard by some awkward handle

I carry my board into the office or into the garage and that's about it, otherwise I'm standing on it and riding it. 

There was this one random time though when I went for a long ride, ended up in downtown Sacramento and they had the streets closed off and beer being sold everywhere. 

Needless to say I rolled my board straight to the nearest booth to get some beer, had to drag it throughout the whole area while I was there hitting on chicks.

Some things you just cannot help, accidents happen and I had to have a few unplanned beers before heading home, but such is life, right? 

Carrying it around just makes me feel funny..

Cool story; whilst getting my board from the anonymous gifter on here, I went into the city by greyhound with my sax on my back and a backpack. Intentions were to make some money busking with my sax while I was there. 

After getting said board, I had to take a couple trains to get back to my greyhound. I got pretty lost and wound up lugging the board around for so long. Getting on wrong trains in the process. I finally realized I wouldn't be able to catch my greyhound, as I had missed it (poor planning and too much excitement). I tried to book a later one but they were all full.

I sat in the subway on the board, played my sax, and wound up meeting a Broadway musician who invited me to an extremely popular show that was going on backstage. We wound up navigating through a super congested city where I still couldn't actually ride the board and was still stuck carrying it with all my stuff.

Even if I wanted to ride and knew where I was going, I don't think I could've rode the esk8 with all the foot traffic. Ruined my jacket some from the griptape, was very sore the next day, but it was a great day lol.

Moral of the story is, sometimes you do, indeed, have to carry your board around lol

I usually enjoy your enthusiasm a lot. Sometimes you just go with it and go a little overboard. No hate or anything, just correcting things that are not true or rather opinion than fact but stated as such.

[/quote]

I am not going to argue about that because it is silly rather I just state what is standard knowledge. Not everything is about "embracing everything", longboarding is definitely not a fiction. It is not for the consumer the hobbyist or an enthusiast to decide what form factor is given what name and function. It is the competition of the sport itself and it's regulations that define that. A skateboard is universally clear what it is. Check out the close to 950'000 registered riders. Not  a single one of them doesn't ride a board that doesn't fit the text box definition of a skateboard. A double kick skateboard, with non-reverse trucks. To clearly distinguish conversations, online stores and retail chains, it is obvious what one understands under a skateboard- (insert any part e.g: truck, deck etc.) That is why every online store or conversations use skateboard the way they do, since it is a clear distinction from a longboard. It is not up to oneself to redefine definitions to their liking's. The word skateboard is an industry standard with a clear descriptive category of what it entails. For that mater Longoard as well. (won't continue this cuz it follows the same explanation).

[quote="squishy654, post:21, topic:42787"]
don't overly simplify it that way, or if you do, call it ALL skateboarding including electrics, cus that's what they are
[/quote]

Well nope. There a categories and sub-category's in everything for a reason. But for general use and practicality you do not include the odd man out, rarities or persist on minuscule differences for the sake of definition. (otherwise categorizing cars, food would be absolutely impossible).

Again, your opinion isn't fact. So having had that experience doesn't meen al bets are off. It means that dude was way out of your league and trashed the whole field. Also every Dh race has clear rules and regulations regarding every part of your longboard, from deck size to wheelbase, to weight etc.[quote="squishy654, post:21, topic:42787"]

Again just nope. Not a worthy addition to every deck, nor discipline. Neither is there a mandatory skill one needs to have iusing a kicktail and certainly there is no right to ridicule anyone's inability to use one.[quote="squishy654, post:21, topic:42787"]

Ehh well they have them since it is absolutely necessary fur a huge variety of elements, tricks and motion sequences within the sport. "doesn't involve (...)anything that uses them ?

Lol. I'm a musician. The main reason I wanted an esk8 was for gigs where parking sucks. So I do have to be able to carry that. But walking around aimlessly not knowing where to go somewhere I've never been in subways where you aren't supposed to ride skateboards caused me to have to carry the board.

All this longboard talk is making me actually want one though. Those trick videos are rad

My latest creation for carrying my board. I made a grip tape cover and strap. Part of my weekly routine is going to the VA hospital where there are 9 floors worth of nonskateable space. Carrying has seriously been a dilemma for me.

It is a fun deep hole on YouTube they made there :) Definitely entertaining and they've been giving away the first part of their series and doing some more beginner tutorial videos it seems like now (thank god the fidget spinner thing is over)

I dunno

Lol skateboarding to me is just...not my thing all around. Whether it be park, street, trick etc... requires concentration, the opposite of what my soul desires

Longboards, have alot similarities to surfing.. fast, carvy, pumpy, flowy, variable stance, mind clearing.  There is a clear difference to me.


But that has nothing to do with the convo... I like kicktails but boards without them are just fine too.

Commuter?
[/quote]

Yes, commuter and also grocery runner.  Because the board I take to work has different uses than the board I take to the grocery store.  Grocery store board needs to be small and nimble and fit in the cart, commuter board should be fast and super dependable.  Like a 7.5" park/trick deck versus a loaded Tesseract or something.

I would go with "23 Beer Getter, cityslasher" for that one...Although we most likely commute more miles on electric..Electric hasn't really been broken down yet into any standards, now has it?

Here's a great example, although I would lean more toward an old school ditch cruiser this is a great beer getter...
Cheap small cruiser deck, 9 ply for a sturdy ride in case you have beer drinkin, Bennett Vector 5.0 front truck on a wedge with Riptide Krankz for pump rebound, and a very dead 125mm 35degree Randal rkp rear truck spinning some Volante Checkers in 64mm with reds..

That's similar to what I had in mind

It's a 7.5" park/trick deck but the front and back trucks are both forward of their normal position a little bit and a handle on the front

... Why do tech slide skateboard all have kicktails if the form of skating "tech sliding" doesn't involve ollies, kick turns, or anything that uses them?
[/quote]

Blunt slides, tail slides, 1-foots, surrender slides... to name a few 

and they lock you in on big rotations

23 x 8.5 inches. Handle that can probably double as a psuedo-kicktail.

I dunno kicktails. I know how to use them, but as the board gets longer/heavier, I'm usually up on the front trucks, can't really get to the tail without a big shuffle. Have not found the movement to be worth it. Riding on the back half of the board can be fun, but not done much of that.

And if the board is shorter, the tail eats up precious wheelbase.

It's all preference for sure, but I'm leaning heavily toward flowy surfy flexy, RKP trucks, long wheelbase, big soft wheels, for distance covering types of skateboarding.

Now on eboards somehow it's been all about stability and speed so far. Everything all stiff and tight.

But I got ahold of some Ronin based mounts/motors. I think the flow's coming back this season.
