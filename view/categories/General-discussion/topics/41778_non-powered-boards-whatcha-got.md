Over I the secret santa thread @Lionpuncher and I were talking about our regular decks, non-electric. 


I have a Juker Hawaii Woody that I've been riding for a couple of years and a Santa Cruz fishtail laying around somewhere.

I'm curious what you guys ride when batteries are dead or to keep in shape for the zombie apocalypse üòÄ.

I have a couple i go to. 
1. PP Cabellaro version 1 (Reprint) -  pool deck and goofin' around. 
2. Comet Ethos 37  - commuter. Such a rad deck.
3. Comet Voodoo Twin - cruiser. Probs selling in the spring. 
4. Loaded Bhangra - Dancin and LDP. Might even sell this one. Such a nice deck it's hard to decide, but i love the vanguard for the same stuff.

But my main non electric whip is powered by my pup. His name is Scoops (Cooper). I'd say he's equivalent to a 8s3p. We reach speeds of up to 37 km/hr and can sprint for about 5 to 6 km's. He's a bit older now so i decided he shouldn't have to pull me any more. Now he just runs with me...
We's as thick as thieves.

I was wrong. I thought I became a grown up after college and was commuting an hour away for work. Sold the two skateboards I used after buying my first home 15 years or so ago. Last thing I did with them was sat on it to paint the baseboard. 

The one "board" I kept is this Stowboard becuase it's so weird. Never used it much becuase my size 12 shoes barely fits into that cage

I have my Landyachz Bamboo totem pintail board. I wanted to make this board electric in the beggining but I decided not to since this deck has more flex than a boosted it's a good cruising board and rolls way better with the Orangatang in heat wheels I have on mine.

Yeah, the Battle Axe deck's sick! Sits nice and low. Good for riding around town if I have to do a lot of pushing. First board I got was the Lookout though, and it's still my favorite out of the bunch.

Since freeride/downhill has been my main time consumer I got quite the archive. In total mayby 30 decks?! Truck wise, there are some bear kodiaks, cronins, prolights, vortex and rogue. 
No up to date picture of the space...

Moat used liked decks: Bombsquad pocket Ace, rayne deep / fortune, gravity 60, original beetle.

My favorite downhill deck was an Arbor Vugenhausen, but I electrified it for 2 different builds then started refinishing it and sold it. I'm.thinking about getting another but I might get an Arbor Highground instead. 

My kid stole the Santa Cruzfushtail which is a great short distance push deck, I may get another one of those as well.

Because I want to show off mine and see some others. Weirdly enough, after riding esk8 for the past year or so (most of the time malfunctioning) I felt the urge to kick again and carry around a super light board that I don't have to worry about charging. I used to use a penny board. I found out after riding the nickel esk8, I could no longer balance on the penny, so it's no longer my always in the trunk board. (I'm in the city very often and parking sucks). So now that I've again upgraded to longboard esk8s, I even look at nickels as being a bit on the small side. Also more heavy than they need to be. Please follow suite if you'd like to strut your stuff on here.

Deck: Loaded Poke
Griptape: stock
Wheels: 76mm zombie hawgs
Trucks: thunder hollow lights 147mm
Bearings: Heady Shake (figured I'd try them out)

Another one in my quiver Rayne Dark Skull with Rogue cast trucks, needs some risers with the current wheels I've had to cup the RS bushings to stop wheel bite. It is less than ideal.
&
I also don't like the lack of leverage I have from the rockered deck. I like to feel a little on top of the board/pivot point not under it. Call me strange, you get used to it after a while and then prefer the responsive nature :skull_and_crossbones:

I feel like I was just looking at buying that deck recently. There's always a plethora of boards for sale with it being a college town. So I'm constantly looking at used boards and low-balling people.  Got a practically new Arbor complete deck for under $10 the other day lolololol

$10... I buying online... delivery...

The rocker and flares create awesome pockets and the center is really flat. I'm considering turning it "e" along with the Rogue trucks, 186mm wide so I should be able to get a pair of 6355 on there...
It doesn't have the best clearance. @michichopf rates them, I think he is running one with Ronins in Europe (well it was the last deck he hyped to me, so I could be wrong, but it is my guess).

Shout out to you MichiBro hope you're killing it :dark_sunglasses:

I have several boards this was the first board I made. ![image|375x500](upload://2NozN486zxMJCScKoNx2KnCgnf6.jpeg)
My other boards are a drop through, a smaller double kick and a Alva dagger board
