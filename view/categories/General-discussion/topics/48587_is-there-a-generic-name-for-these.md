The rubber kind are often called **Drop Through Rubber Riser Pads**. Mines were the 2 mm type....

If I understand correctly you are not looking for rubber shock pads...try searching "drop through risers" 

Also [sicklongboard.nl ](https://www.sickboards.nl/en/603-risers) have some similar in their risers section :)

Yeah. basically the Steel covers that go on top to stop the screws pulling into your deck.

I dont think it would be a problem if you would use them on top as risers :)
