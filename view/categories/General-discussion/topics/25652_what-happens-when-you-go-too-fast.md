what about going too fast for the vesc based on your kv and cell number as far as effecting brakes and throttle?

You'll just get alot of heat, too much heat and it will all start to fail.

If exceeding the erpm limit of the vesc, it could loose the speed and with it the connection to the motor and start stuttering or throwing drv errors and shut down in the worst case. So no brakes or throttle anymore.

Ok there's that limit and someone please tell me if I'm right in that if going over the no-load speed and accelerating it would actually brake?  And what happens when braking once past the no-load?
(No-load = kv x voltage)
