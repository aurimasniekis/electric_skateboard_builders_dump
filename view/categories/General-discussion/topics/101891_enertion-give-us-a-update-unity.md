Welcome to business with Enertion.  2 years ago this black friday they sold the focboxes before they had them in stock but it seems like they had a bunch 6 months later people were just getting there order.

I'm pretty sure you can buy Unitys in bulk (like, 100+ quantities) from the factory in China ([via Alibaba](https://au111401407.fm.alibaba.com/product/62007371043-0/Enertion_FocBox_Dual_FOC_Motor_Controller.html?spm=a2700.icbuShop.89.2.275c73af3joDRj)) and they ship before the ones that Enertion is selling.

I annoyed the crap out of them for a long while. Ordered in May received in in September. I made a point to badger the forums and email support weekly. I have a feeling they dont go in order of purchase date, but based on who is the most vocal.

But if you're not squeaky, you don't need oil.

The business has no cash so they have to build up pre-orders to fund their builds. Very high chance of going bust IMO.

same here, unfortunately. I got my Unity now, but it was painful to have to wait for so long after all the broken promises of delivery.

my thought exactly....Enertion should scrap everything and put all available resources into Unity production and fixing their reputation. I think this will save them. NO ONE....NO ONE wants lawyers poking their noses into the esk8 community. no "disrespek" to any lawyers in the group.

Got my first response from @CarlCollins on email for the forst time in probably 3 weeks.  He said their still following this [Scheduele](https://enertionboards.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001123596-When-is-my-FOCBOX-Unity-shipping-) so ill guess well see if that holds up. Placed my order the 1 june.

@Chaki I'm sorry but EnertionboardsUSA is a separate entity to Enertion Boards and we aren't able help with this. We are now selling Unitys on Amazon and ship on the same day though

I have a couple of questions, 

Why would Jason give up distribution to the US, probably his largest market? I think I read that they were looking to start selling via Amazon.

Why has enertion/Jason allowed you to use his company name and logo. What agreement has been made, did you buy the rights from him? 

Why would you want to be associated with enertion, why not just be a reseller of the unity under your own brand and provide quality support. Enertion's brand has a terrible reputation and is clearly in financial difficulty. (Reason why I haven't purchased another unity, as I unsure if I would ever receive it)

I am a little sceptical, and part of me thinks this is Jason selling stock under an alias to get some cash flow, letting other legitimate DIYers wait even longer for their orders to be fulfilled.

This has to be a Troll!
