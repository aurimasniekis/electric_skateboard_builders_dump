Hi guys,

I just wanted to put a little idea out there for a build I am planning on starting mid-summer. I go to school at Worcester Polytechnic Institute, and there are quite a few E-Sk8s popping up all around campus, most are DIY. I saw a video of an 8 wheel skateboard, and instantaneously knew what I wanted to make. An 8 wheel 4WD E-Sk8!

Now, I know what some of you are thinking.

"It's not cost effective."
"It won't be efficient."
"It's too complicated!"

But that's not the point. The point is to make something truly unique! I want to make a board that a bystander will do a double take and say "wait... that is an 8 wheel longboard... and he's not even pushing!"

I have already been tossing around ideas on paper. Here is one belt layout I've been thinking about. It's by no means my final design, but is merely a schematic to show what it might look like.

There may be some issues with the motor pulley skipping, I'll look into it.

There is still so much left to do. Lots of modeling in CAD, lots of machining (my specialty at WPI :wink: ), and lots of trial and error. And most of all, I have to finish my current E-Sk8 project before I head off for a project term in Copenhagen, Denmark (Really looking forward to E-Sk8ing there! Most bike friendly city in the world!).

What do you guys think? Please give me all your thoughts!

You've just split the majority of your torque between two wheels on this setup with one getting more than the other wheel. I might be wrong on that thought. Would be better if each wheel was a hub motor, but I know you have budget limits...

```
The torque should be evenly split, not that it really matters. In fact, if one wheel loses traction, the other wheel will absorb most of the torque. I think it's more of a situational thing.

Could you explain your uneven torque theory a bit more? I don't quite follow.

 I was assuming that thought based off driving a four wheel drive car with the transfer case because power splits between the front and rear wheels depending on road condition but what you said is correct after consulting the internet about the distribution of forces between multiple pulleys assuming each pulley as the same number of teeth.

nice to see another pic of those crazy double truck things.   they're so rare even on the internet.  Have you seen or ridden them in person?  I imagine they handle fine.  how about just getting one 63mm motor on it, especially on that little board, or any board, unless you plan to do a lot of long sustained hills or you're heavy the extra motors are likely overkill.  And you dont care.  maybe get some miniature motors.  i can't imagine any benefits of having 4 motors and pulleys vs just one motor especially with the ability to drive two wheels with the one motor using that weird double truck thing...I imagine it wouldn't effect the turning
i see you have 63mm motors already planned.  4 of those you could make four boards.  at least try the one maybe before going through the time screwing them all down.  there are children starving in africa and you want four motors on a penny board.  yuk yuk

I have not seen or ridden any, but I think I'll machine some tandem mounts for a push rider I have, just to test it out. It may turn out that I hate it, would be valuable to know before building a whole E-Sk8 around it!

the tandem mount could be a platform on which you could put all the electronics and even the battery, and of course the motor and drive system.  all on that one screw on part.  that would be some cool engineering and bet people who could only turn one screw would turn that one needed screw to be turned.  not your idea but I love those crazy tandem things.  never even seen them in real life

This is one reason I got so excited about making a tandem mount. It would be a universal solution that could be used on any truck! Not only that, but it also widens the wheelbase, something I understand is sought after among E-Sk8ers.

```
this is a cool idea. My eyes widened as soon as I saw it!

however I see a few issues. first is that one of your wheels doesn't have more than a third of the teeth in mesh. also the RPM of the wheels are locked together and that will make turning corners difficult as there is no differential.

i think the motor with its fewer teeth is more in question and in this instance it's good.  the other pulleys look like lots of teeth and will get enough engagement.  
turning, I think since both wheels will be traveling on the same path they will turn the same speed.

think so.  given that these two powered wheels would travel the same path they will be traveling the same distance when turning unlike a single axle where the inner wheel has a shorter distance to travel while turning.

I have to say that I agree with @Hummie. For a 4wd car, with ackermann steering, this is probably true. However, these wheels are always aligned. Any difference in speed should be negligible.

I'm probably not going to mount anything but the motor to the tandem truck, in the interest of keeping it light and responsive to the road (needs to pivot). Also, I would be afraid of the vibrations transmitted to the battery and VESC if they were directly mounted to the tandem mount.

there was a time jacob, of jacob's hub motors, or emf, was trying to make a vesc that went in the hub motor or at least right beside it.  a lot of vibrations.  I'm still obsessed with potting one or at least doing a large conformial coating.  I think the vibrations could be made not a problem.  the battery and vibrations shouldnt be a problem I wouldnt think.  not your plan though.  maybe the extra weight on the truck would help keep it stable or at least the weight would resist speed wobbles

it's not arguing just talking about how it would work.  look at you now?  

 in my mind since the two powered wheels are both the same distance and angle from the center of the truck they will have very similar revolutions from a turn.  I'm still voting it'll work without any downsides in handling until someone gives a good reason it wont work well.

I'm not looking to argue either. I should have clarified in the beginning of the post, each tandem mount will have its own motor. So the inside and outside wheels will be able to turn at independent RPMs. It's the front/back that will be turning at the same RPM (forced by the belt). Since each front/back wheel should follow roughly the same path, I believe it would be a fair assumption to say the RPMs would be the same.

As an engineering student, I am always looking to learn more. I think a fun test would be to make an 8 wheel pusher board, and put some form of paint or powder on the wheels so it draws a line. If they trace the same line, it is fair to say the wheel RPM will be the same, since they follow the same path. If not, then your hypothesis will be proven correct.

The tandem truck design (non-motorized) is a pretty non-ideal design in it of itself (as is the regular 2 wheel truck, since it is not ackerman), since the angle between the group of 4 wheels is fixed. Ideally, they should be able to turn to different angles, like this lego model below. However, that hasn't stopped anyone from making them. I'm excited to test out the 8 wheel setup on a non-powered board to see how it handles.

  Good luck making this work man.  It will be cool if you pull it off.  Maybe it will be cool even if you dont.  
The problem I see is that as the two wheels pivot around the main axle the geometry of the pulleys changes so the belt length changes.  Also idle pulleys aren't really meant to go on the drive side of a belt or chain which since you've shown it between the two wheels it would have to be.  The pulley would need to be as solidly mounted and have the same quality bushings as the wheels themselves since it would be under the same strain.
  A solution to both these problems would be if you could somehow put the driving pulley on the same axis as the main axle.  That way the geometry stays the same the wheels pivot.  If you had a jackshaft extending out from the end of the axle with a drive pulley on it, you could drive the jack shafts with your motor.  If the top of the drive pulley were below a line tangent to the top of the driven pulleys (which it would not be unless the wheel geometry was changed from your drawing) then you could route the chain/belt around the top of your drive pulley like the idle pulley in your drawing and have tons of belt engagement on all three pulleys.  Of course, this will only work with chain, unless they make belts that are toothed on both sides.  Sheesh, it's starting to seem kinda complicated!
  Btw, I do think the tires would scrub a tiny bit on the turns but not enough to even notice.
  Anyway, good luck dude.  I'll check in tomorrow and see what's up.

@Pstrap Thanks for the kind words. I don't really see how the geometry of the pulleys would change relative to each other, however. I didn't draw the actual plate that they would both be mounted to, so I can see the confusion with that. 

The wheels and motor would all be fixed in position to the same plate that pivots around the main axle. So, the geometry between them should be fixed. 

I am also a bit confused about what you said about idler pulleys. In this design the idler (or tensioner) is on the non-toothed side of the belt, which I think is a pretty normal configuration, at least with car engines. Could you clarify a bit?

Oh you are going to mount the motor off the yoke piece that joins the wheels to the axle.  Well, that makes sense.  I thought the motor would be mounted the the axle.  Yeah, I get it now.
  Yeah, the back of the belt can wrap around the idle pulley.  That's fine.
My point about the idle pulley was this:  When one pulley drives another via belt or chain, the length of belt transmitting the force is under great tension, while the other length of belt that returns to the drive pulley from the driven pulleys is more or less slack.  This allows you to use a very light weight bearing for an idle pulley on the slack side.  That is how bicycle derailleurs work.  You can put an idle pulley on the drive side, it just has to be much more sturdy, as study as the wheel and motor in your case.  Also, since the belt transmits force in the opposite direction when braking or in reverse, there is no part of your belt that will always be "slack".
  Anyway, to sum up, just make your idle pulley sturdy enough to take the strain.  But you probably already knew that.
 I hope you do make this.  Good luck mate.

@Pstrap Your tension/slack concept is something that I have not considered until now, but it totally makes sense now that I think of it. Thanks for the useful information. From that, I think I'll place it somewhere that will have equal stress between throttle/braking.

The position you showed in your drawing might be good.  You could fabricate a yoke piece that had a stub shafts coming off it to mount the idle pulley.  You need to look for an appropriately sized pulley with a bearing inside it, I guess.
Your design is good.  Build it!!!

I just tried out my new electric build using some tandem mounts just in the front. The board is definitely slightly heavier. The handling seems a little less snappy, which I think is a good thing, since it felt a little too snappy for my liking. It's mellowed out the board in all the best ways without sacrificing overall hadling ability. 

The biggest difference I see with the 6 wheel board vs a regular 4 wheel board is a remarkable increase in ride quality. Every bump I go over feels less pronounced, even though the wheels are smaller (70s in the front 83s in the back).

At this point I am sold an 8 wheeler is going to make an awesome project, and have full intentions of moving forward with coming up with a viable design.

Will post a picture of the current setup soon.

You could also put pulleys around Carvon motors and spin those motors with another motor and achieve 8 motor drive but only 4 wheel drive

This design is how you kill your motors from road vibration... It is going to shake the motor to pieces when the wheel/motor mount pivots

...and it has no upside.  It adds tons if drag, doesn't make it any more stable.  Just, why?

There is one upside to having the pivot 8 wheel design, it handles big bumps very well. When my 8 wheel was working, I went over a massive dip at 20MPH and barely felt it. A 4 wheel would have made me eat it for sure. That being said, the downsides of the 8 wheel setup far outweigh the benefits, as I have learned, and have been trying to convey to others on this forum that want to try it

I'll have to take your word for it.  I don't see it.  I rode a push one once and it was like trying to talk a nun out of her panties...not gonna happen 😀
