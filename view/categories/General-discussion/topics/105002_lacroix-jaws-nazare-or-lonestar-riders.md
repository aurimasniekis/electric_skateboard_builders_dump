Hi all and Happy new year and rides.

As a new owner of a LaCroix Nazaré since September, I am looking for riders that own such a board to share experiences, rides and have a beer discussing of tips...

I am localized in France and Switzerland.

PS: I do not have FB account and do not plan to get one.
