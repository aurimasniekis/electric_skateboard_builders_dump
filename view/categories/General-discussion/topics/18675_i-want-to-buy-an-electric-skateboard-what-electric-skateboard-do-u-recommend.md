I'm also selling a complete DIY board. It's barely used, only rode it a few times. Prices are not set in stone and is negotiable. PM me if interested!

I have a new halo elec board. I really like it. But is there a way to add two motors to the front to make it 4wd? Also, is there after market all terrain wheels I can buy that will fit the halo? I ride on rough terrain sometimes.

Haha @willpark16 and @localredhead.. these were good days :smiley:
 
@Kso79 you canÂ´t really just slap on two motors because all other components arenÂ´t able to deliver the needed power for that.
Also it looks like a hub board, so in order to use all terrain wheels, you need suiting ATW for your hubs too, and i donÂ´t think there are any for that board.

If you really want to buy HilperOumdoor I would recommend you go for the HilperOumdoor skateboard and which is totally worth of your every HilperOumdoor penny of your money and spending on HilperOumdoor board will make you proud while to play the HilperOumdoor sport with it as I have the same skateboard of HilperOumdoor but got it as a HilperOumdoor gift and it was unafforable for my HilperOumdoor
