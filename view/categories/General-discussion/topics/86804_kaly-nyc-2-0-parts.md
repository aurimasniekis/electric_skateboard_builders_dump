**What's up! Yesterday we took a trip out to @Kaly (Ernesto's Shop) to go hang out with the crew. I decided I would take some behind the scene photos of the parts for the New 2.0 Kaly that will soon be shipped out to all customers. Ernesto in one of our main guys in the group and we will always support local builders before a commercial brand. Here I showcase the deck, trucks, trucks with complete set up, and wheel hub set up. Next week I will add on the complete board for those who want different views of it.**![IMG_0328|690x460](upload://mNEXpxATFpIbKD2tTaGTkbnWRx8.jpeg) ![IMG_0331|690x460](upload://uewBAVQGFrLk86CSy3fPMj0ANX8.jpeg) ![IMG_0332|690x460](upload://36qBHxb3nqknJczQNogCuJtq0Lm.jpeg) ![IMG_0339|690x460](upload://4DLdsILT45idJYZLs25DWctEUTn.jpeg) ![IMG_0340|690x460](upload://q4Y0jWLz82UlL2wXDQIbQ0KRcMk.jpeg) ![IMG_0341|690x460](upload://ikDu4jMzpzPPs5mxcGKz3mL8u2E.jpeg) ![IMG_0342|690x460](upload://C2sO3xrqUALR41IjsDNGj76bKk.jpeg) ![IMG_0346|690x460](upload://nTaxAuTR5G59DJTbgsr0dDpzic4.jpeg) ![IMG_0347|690x460](upload://rEzHoJKCFdyZRf9yWeotCM78cjw.jpeg) ![IMG_0351|690x460](upload://60hEuUA8OmzYdTftmQTIOpGGgKq.jpeg) ![IMG_0353|690x460](upload://8miUQjTrbYB701KRZR9YrZeyUc.jpeg) ![IMG_0355|690x460](upload://r7VhmADInlW1gF0B7OE9b6lMfWy.jpeg)

Anytime! Thank you for the kind words. I definitely won't. Soon I will feature the current board I ride that is made by another local builder Xavier (The X Board).

I'll use this line for the second time:

What's it like knowing you've given another man an erection?

I really need to get to the city again. I’m only like a hour and a half by train but I just hate going to the city.

This year will be more insane. Lots of Kaly boards in the streets of NYC with a few new builds that are all fast.

Yeah I actually talked to him not that long ago we might do a collab in the future since we are so close.

@DeadShutterNYC your pictures are amazing. Every time that my wife and I get to the city we always try to find a new place like high line park and the sea port district.

Don’t forget about me if your going up the parkway exit 98 summer time it will be busy but exit 100 will be less traffic and almost a straight shot to Asbury

Asbury has 2 breweries and a distillery I would recommend doing the pub crawl during the week as you know how the beach towns get in the summer during the weekends. We get the Bennys up here and you get the shoebees down there.
