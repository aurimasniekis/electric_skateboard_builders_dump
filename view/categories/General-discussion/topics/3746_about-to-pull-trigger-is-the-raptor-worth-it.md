I'm on the brink of pulling the trigger on a board.

I've been weighing up options of building, having one built or buying. With the release of new boards recently, I think I'm going to buy a production board to start and hopefully build one along the way.
Which brings me to my next problem.
I'm really liking the Evolve GT. Versatile, good range, good power.
The biggest thing for me in looking around has been finding that Evolve has a pretty decent rap. They have a decent history behind them.
I lost interest pretty quickly in the Boosted Board due to a very vague 'upgrade' v2.

Enertion Raptor was the next option. However the board is pretty limited in my opinion.
However for me, the biggest thing that turned me off Enertion has been his attitude I've found in posts and videos.
Honestly, I understand this forum is run by Enertion, however I don't think that makes it OK to be hypocritical.
After following some VLOGS and watching his latest, I'm very turned off Enertion.
He attacks larger companies for over charging for products which they can supposedly build for half the cost, yet he is trying to provide a product in the same market, at a higher cost.
He is saying pre-built/production boards are pushing people to DIY, yet he claims to have the "best" board available???
A board which can't even be tested as a complete unit prior to sale as the battery is **_DROP SHIPPED_** to the customer separate to the board?
Attacking the GT saying it's not the most versatile board? He offers his board as one set up and that's how it is...
I'm sorry, but I don't feel like spending over 2g for a board that isn't tested as a unit, aggression from the builder when people don't agree with him and criticism of other companies when he's doing the same thing. 
There's claims for the raptor saying it's the leader, and I've been searching for video tests and all and found nothing?
I even asked for videos and no response.
It makes me wonder if the Raptor is really worth it if there's no evidence and he is bagging out other companies.

I know this seems aggressive and I apologise, but it's frustrating trying weigh up options when everyone is claiming something, but with little to nothing to back it up. 
It's a big call to claim quality when there's no proof behind it. Additionally with a seemingly scared response when a competitor comes along.
If the Raptor is worth the consideration as people say, then I want to see.

Thoughts?

I searched "enertion raptor test" and found [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JgKPCrG5Nyc)... It's a comparison of the boosted board dual plus vs the enertion raptor mono drive. Evolve's new board is looking to be a monster imo. I would say go the DIY route, you will learn a lot and get more bang for your buck.

isn't it a bit of a philosophical question too? 

- With the raptor you quite know what you get, even the ESC / VESC is opensource
- With the evolve GT you for sure will get a awesome board too (when you got it, please take it apart and let us know whats inside)

I'll give my thoughts. 

First some background.  I used to street skate in my middle school days.  In the last few years I picked up longboarding again.  My first electric board was a boosted dual plus, and I was quickly bored with it.  The speed is meh, specially after you have bombed some hills on a longboard.  The max continuous speed of 20mph feels like nothing.  The range was horrible and that was the main reason I decided to look at other options.  The customer service, smoothness, and acceleration curves were great though.  

I sold my boosted and ordered the enertion raptor based on the specs and after doing a lot of back and forth with enertion/Jason and many other members on the forum.  There is a serious lack of customer review videos, so it was scary to drop nearly $2k USD but I trusted the forum members here and I am putting my faith in Jason from Enertion to deliver.  I informed enertion that as soon as I get mine I will make an unboxing video, do a quick test ride.  Then I'll update and do a detailed review after a week or two of riding.  It will be a quality video, not like a cell phone or gopro video.  I am planning on doing objective tests such as speed, range, hill climbing etc as well as give my subjective opinion on the feel of the board, build quality, reliability etc etc.  

I ordered at the beginning of April, and when I ordered the shipping estimate stated "next batch will be shipped late April".  Enertion confirmed I would get my board in 30 days, which later got changed to 30-60 days, and I am sill waiting for any signs of a board shipping.  Apparently there is a wait for a VESCs, which are just now being delivered so I'm hoping I will get mine by end of June per most recent info by enertion.  So best case scenario I would get my board 3 months after ordering. 

My honest advice to you would be just to wait until all the customers who have ordered in February get their boards.  Those should be in the midst of shipping I hope.  There will be a lot more video reviews coming soon.  I know I will do one, but it may be overshadowed by others who get their boards before me and do video reviews.

This is my other concerns.  Supply has been so inconsistent as well as parts sourcing. 
I was reading a page the other day where people were still waiting from February?? And we're just about in June. 
Each batch he seems to be getting different parts? Is there consistency between batches?

Doesn't seem like there is consistency, that's just how it is.  I think per Enertion in a few months things will smooth out and the raptor will be delivered as soon as it is ordered.  

You can get the evolve GT if you just want a board by a big company that looks awesome, has the performance, and is more versatile.  Again delivery times for those are still to be determined.  Based on pure specs the raptor is still better performance wise.

Then there is the DIY route.  This is the most rewarding as you can get exactly what you want, but it will be a hassle and a lot of trial and error.  Do this only if you enjoy building these boards.  

If you want an almost complete board that is insane, @chaka  from Ollinboards sells a deck with a complete electronics package.  http://www.ollinboardcompany.com/product/dual-esc-integrated-power-system-longboard-deck
This looks like a beast, you would just have to buy wheels, bearings, motors, trucks, and motor mounts.   

AND last but not least, there is one other secret place where you can get a killer board from.  If you prefer a custom wood deck with the same enertion motors as the raptor... @longhairedboy builds some sick stuff.  Check out his build threads, specially that black metal scarlet 12s monster he is making for some lucky dude!  If you want more info about longhairedboy boards, PM me and I'll give you all the details.  http://longhairedboy.com/longboards/

No consistency isn't how it is. Or at least shouldn't be. 
It basically means a review on a board from batch 2, could be completely redundant for a board from batch 3

You expect a bit much from a small company. This is not Apple selling millions of units but a dude in his garage. Every single raptor will be different because it is hand made and not on a production line by robots. 
Also you are complaining that a raptor would take long to ship but forget that with an evolve it is not like they send one out immediately after you order. It will also take months if you order now.

These are not products you just go and buy in a store (yet) as soon as you decide you want one. Problem is that people (me included) are so used to having everything delivered the next day once you decide to buy something, that we forget how small companies have to work.
The raptor seems like a good product and you know all the parts that are included and can order them separately if something breaks - evolve you basically have to buy a new one or rely on their customer service if anything goes wrong.

Your call... just don't be unfair to small companies that are not Apple, Amazon or Samsung.

Not trying to be unfair mate. Quite the opposite.  He's an Australian business. I support Australian. So is Evolve. 

You say evolve don't ship out the next day? Talk to their customers (I have). I understand presale is different to a standard sale, but you go in to that knowing.
I know enertion is small business and I'm all about promoting small business. 
But when someone bags out companies selling complete boards, then does the same for more $$ that's when I question them. 

I come from bikes and rarely order anything online. I'm used to speaking one on one with small one off shop owners, who generally do what they can. And I've never once been sworn at

The Tesla Model 3 will deliver in 2018 if you order now.

Custom built things take time - we are just not used to it anymore because we basically can get everything we want shipped across the globe in 24h. But that only works with mass produced goods. This is not. Instead you should enjoy knowing that you will be part of a small circle of raptor riders...

Comparing it to a Tesla is a big step. 
You're missing my point. Set times are one thing. But from what I'm reading are most people wait unknowing of build or delivery status? No communication etc. 
Further these aren't special order vehicles. They're (apparently) built all the same. I understand he builds them to order and stock can run out. But continuous supply issues/changes and delivery changes is my concern. I get it's not mass produced and there can be individualities. However batch to batch having different components??

No it's not - it is an electric vehicle. Just because it requires more parts and is bigger does not make the fundamental process any different. You order - they produce (as fast as they can).
There is more communication on here about delays, progress and whatever than you will find for other products. Tesla will not give you any information, Apple will not, Evolve will not.

And do you really think there are no changes made to other products? If a manufacturer sees a way to save money they will change it as soon as they can. So yeah - as long as the outside performance stays the same companies will change components even mid-batch if it is economical. But with enertion you will probably not only get the cheaper parts but maybe also added features or increased performance or better quality - so no reason to not like them making changes. At the time of order you agree to the deal they offer - the product will not be made worse so you get exactly what you ordered - or a little better.

--> nothing to complain about

Hi loose_nickers

First - change that nick name please.   :slight_smile:

Joking aside:
I do see your point, absolutely. If you state them though there are always going to be the people that jump blindly to support the "garage business". (Not saying they do  not have a point but I think you all get my drift.)
As you say "I think I'm going to buy a production board to start and hopefully build one along the way." I personally would advise to buy the Evolve and if you like it and think that there may be a way to improve then you can always build one as well. If you wish to use Enertion products then you always can, hey you can build your own Raptor then.
I have not ridden the Evolve but they have a decent enough rap and the new board does look good so I think it would be a pretty safe bet.
As you are an experienced skater though maybe it is performance that is the key and then sure, building it yourself is the only way as you an build it to your liking. 
Decisions decisions...
Whichever way you go I hope you get the ride you are looking for.

I've read all of the posts previously and will offer just an opinion. I can understand the frustration with not being able to get your product "immediately". We all live in a "fast-food" world where immediate gratification is the rule these days. I actually do have the raptor, having just received it about a week ago. I've been dealing with Jason for almost a year and a half now and find him to be courteous, helpful, giving and level headed. I disagree with the statement that he would ever try purposely to be biased concerning his boards vs others. In fact, I feel he's gone out of his way to try and give all manufacturers equal scrutiny. He's always inviting anyone with any other manufacturer board to post their thoughts and opinions. As far as the raptor is concerned I couldn't be anything but impressed. This board is a monster. It handles great, has tremendous battery life and the new handheld remote is superb. I was lucky enough to receive (I think) the new battery compartment lid so I have not had ANY issues with connectivity. I really love the board and was able to ride the boosted board previously. I actually think there's no comparison. The raptor is wonderful. Look, let's face it, there's going to be improvements and "new" boards hitting the market every few months. We all have to understand that these things are going to be like the computer market. No sooner will you buy one when something new will appear. Jason is an innovator. He's what industry needs to move forward. For that very reason I love supporting him and his goals.

I'd really like to throw my two cents in on this one... But I'm caught by a rather curious note...

It seems with the raptor, as many are continually stating, the final product is not really final yet.. and that it is changing and upgrading as it goes...

You could really say that Jason's product is still evolving...

Ironic, isnt it..?

i'd say Raptor Dual !

because you said it . you want to buy one & later build one . so here is my suggestion ~

get a Dual Raptor !
at least if you want to make a new DIY eboard , after you've purchased the Dual Raptor ?
you can just take one set of motor + esc + belt + motor mount .......
and transfer all of those to a brand new board of your choosing : )
oh yes , not to forget though .
just need to get a remote GT2B (or others) & 1 more (probably 24V Li Ion)  battery
 
now you have TWO ELECTRIC LONGBOARD ! ! ! ! ! YaaaaaaY !
you can ride alongside your friend , girlfriend , boyfriend or siblings : )


when you buy other makes , you CANNOT strip them down to your liking .
UN STRIP ABLE . is my english correct ? i'm not caucasian . i am malay asian from singapore .
but with the Dual Raptor ?
you CERTAINLY can .
thats my point !
am i correct on this one ?
somebody back me up please .

I bought my raptor for the reason that if anthing brakes it can easily be repaired and i am not dependent on a single vendor if he is willing to repair my board or if he thinks it is to old i need to buy his new board.
if you are in europe you could also buy a complete from esk8.de than you would have to pay the import taxes into the eu.
and i do think you could get this boards build to your custom specs since every board is build on order. And if you buy in europe you get 2 years warranty what i would personaly like with the vesc since they seem to brake quite often

Here's my 2 cents (in 2324 lines of text):

Looking at the Raptor you see a "bleeding edge" product that simply offers everything regular non-diy boards just don't offer, from specs to customization. Someone once mentioned that the Raptor is really just a pre-assembled DIY board (minus the battery) rather than something just off the shelf and that is exactly it. It is raw, not beginner friendly, and is to be taken seriously. The Boosted board is easy, simple, and isn't even intimidating enough to make stupid NYC riders wear a fucking helmet. From the experiences I've heard from owners with their Raptor, if you were to ride it at full speed with no gear you will likely kys lol. 

As far as liking Jason goes, I really only value these two things: that he fixes my board if its a manufacturer defect or helps me fix it if its my fault. I just need customer service. I don't give two fucks about how much he talks about competitors, won't even go into that, if he delivers a great product I am happy! Rather than scrutinize him all the time I'd rather just ride my board. The wait time @Photorph and others have experienced was (imo) due to Jason not realizing how much demand there would be and the difficulties that come with getting shit from manufacturers. Lots of the issues with delays have been to him dealing with manufacturers getting shit wrong (like the replacement lids, and new decks), customs hold ups (like the battery and wheels),  or not anticipating demand and ordering enough (like the VESCs). All of those problems are being solved or have already been. In my opinion, for a single man op he has done quite well considering the limitations he has as a small business.

Looking at the Evolve, you see a promising board that looks well polished and all around great. If I were just looking for a nice commuting/recreational vehicle I'd only get the GT. BUT what the GT doesn't have that the Raptor does is customizable power and endless torque. The GT can climb hills and stuff and thats great, but from what I've seen/heard its nothing compared to the power of the Raptor. And takes twice as long to hit the top speeds it claims. Basically, it is not the best option if you are a speed demon and want the best. The Raptor goes 0-45km in 3 seconds. The GT goes 0-40kmh in about 5-6 seconds (according to beta testers) and some don't even hit that top speed.

**TLDR;** If you want to just have some good ol' fun tearing it up in the dirt for hours on end and cruising around town get the GT. If you want to mind-fuck the masses, shit your pants at the idea of going full throttle, and generally just get to places faster, then go with the Raptor. I personally will get both :)

I own the dual plus and the raptor dual and I just sold the old carbon. I have to say that nothing can be compared to the speed and torque of the raptor. But if you want something that works out of the box go with the gt. The raptor has some "bugs" like connecting problems and from my opinion riding the board is more different from riding a longboard than the other boards. But if you want the best power, speed and the advantage of customization the the raptor.

@loose_nickers Jason will back his Raptor if you put faith in a purchase. He wants it to be the best product and hence why he has gone out of his way to  replace the lids at no cost to Raptor 0.1 buyers. 

Understand your concerns on the man himself.  Hes too passonate on the forurm hence why hes takem himself off the forum. Hes praised evolve on the GT in his last vid.  Its going to be a biased opinion and definately he comes off the wrong way in how he responds to comnents. Text never comes out as well as words face to face. 

All I say is just be patient which ever way you go.  These eboards take forever.  Well you can get the current evolve and street off the self.  If its the latest new release youll have to wait.  I ordered my Raptor presale in Nov and it didnt arrive till late Feb.  Get over the wait.  Most of Enertions issue is parts supply.  I dont understand what all the fuss is over Enertion.  Do you understand. 

Make your own descision based on what your comfortable with and paying. You wont lose. All these boards are good.  You cam always sell it if you dont like it.

electronics are under the carbon fiber, so you should be safe from water. you can also seal the hole where the motor wires go into the deck for additional water proofing. You don't have much to worry about with water, just make sure you clean your bearings if they get wet.

The Raptor motors arent waterproof. You need to get some cooling in there. As a rule I dont go over even small wet paths,  but you can do that as only the wheels will get wet. Water and motors dont mix.  Electronics are sealed on Raptor. 

Theres also the issue of slippery conditions anyway like what Evolve have advised. You lot want this thing to be everything.  Its an expensive product and should be used in an appropriate manor. Common sense.  Ive gone over like a wetted path becuase garden tap left on,  but didn't realise till after going through it.  Raptor was fine, wet wheels.. Just dont use it in wet is my advice. Im sure evem BB2 wont handle ploughing through a puddle,  even if they say so. IMO

Hi Chris, thanks for your honest feedback,

let me clear a few things up.


1. the handle is included but we stopped installing it as some people didn't want it installed, but you should have received one in the box. ill send you one.

2. the missing screws, this is not the first instance of this... I asked my guys how many they are putting in each board, they answered correctly, but maybe you got shortchanged... will send you more. The newer batches of CF decks only have 8 screws.

3. instructions for the remote are online in various places, but we definitely need to do better documentation with our products, we are working on that. We haven't spent much money or time working on our packaging & booklets.

4. You are a Raptor VIP customer and have a solid warranty to back up this product. I will replace any faulty part related to manufacturing faults for FREE in the first 12 months. (that's twice as long as boosted boards warranty).... However, it does require you to send it somewhere unless you want to do the repair yourself with parts we send you.... ALSO NOTE: If you purchase a boosted board you would need to send it in for repairs too... If you don't want to send to East side of US, I Now have a West Coast agent who can help resolve these few issues.

5. If you feel like your emails are not getting responded to adequately I apologise, I have three new staff (before them it was just me) and they are all trying hard to answer with meaningful content in a timely manner... ASLO, Feel free to discuss your concerns in the forum, this is a place i frequently visit & i actually like all information to be discussed openly in the public forums, I believe this is the best way to offer service as it also helps other raptor owners if they can read & learn from the experiences of others.

6. I am sorry you feel like you got mislead &/or purchased something that is not as _"good"_ as the mainstream brands.... YES, I work out of my garage and build RAPTORS one-by-one-by-hand.... This is fairly common knowledge & not a fact I actively try to hide from my customers. I suppose if you only look at my website and none of my other online resources this fact might not be obvious.... I suggest watching my [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFugBVZgaQ5fCp-kLmyWq1A) & reading the [raptor build thread](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/behind-the-scenes-raptor-electric-skateboard-production-process/619) to see who I am and what i do.


If you are truly disappointed in the raptor and don't want the hassle of getting repairs done we can discuss the option of trading-in the Raptor to someone else who is waiting. You get your money back & someone can get your second-hand raptor for a discounted price.

I am open to suggestions, Let me know what you want to do.

Thanks for posting, too bad about your unfortunate experience so far. I hope you get your board back soon and some more miles on it. Would you please keep us informed about what the problem with your board turns out to be? Do you suspect bad VESC's caused by the short?

Besides your board malfunction, It seems from your vid there are a few items that you would like to see improved. -Softer, more durable wheels? Better mounting of the electronics?, instructions? A guard over the battery switch or a system to prevent accidental turnoff?

I have read here a few raptor owners have swapped their wheels out for a softer compound. There should also be detailed info on the remote and reciever here somewhere. 

Best of luck getting it back out rolling under electric power, BTW, how was it pushing? Much more resistance than a regular long board?

@sandBound Sorry to hear about your initial experience abour the Raptor. It does pay do some research on these items outside of the website. When I was looking the thing that caught my eye was that it was an Aus company and if I had any issues I could return it easily as I was looking at the Boosted. All in hindside for you though.

Enertion have taken the VESC issue and acted quickly to notify others. However I thought they advised it didnt affect Raptors which ouconcerns me about my board. Mine did have issues initially as well which was fixed. So know how your feeling at the moment,

Enertion will fix the board as its all under warranty.

Decide on whether you want to take up the return offer.

 I will say that when the Raptor works theres nothing reallly like it. Im sure you felt that for the first 20miles at least, just try and keep that in mind.

All the things can be fixed and Enertion have noted as much.

The corner guards can be removed for better aesthetics, but less protection. Batch 1 never had those. 

Not happy with the wheel issues either. Must be due to the last batch. Mine are handling surfaces well. Most are looking at Abec 11 83mm 75as as alternatives for softer ride.

Remote. To bind to board. Turn on board. Press and hold A till red light on left turns soild. Now connected.

Push throttle up to accelerate and pull back to brake. Press down for cruise, but this is not like s car cruise as the speed just adjust to riding condititions,not locked speed. Pull down to brake.

Theres also a channel change function, but you can search for that in threads if you need that.

@sandbound 

Thanks for sharing.  A few things.

1) the wheels are 80a durometer however you can swap them out for softer flywheels.  Keep in mind though that soft wheels loose chunks even easier, I see how already lost a chunk in one of your wheels.  

2) I was missing two screws as well.  Asides from just looking like it is missing two screws, it doesn't really effect much else.  I didn't bother to ask for more screws.  I could have went to Home Depot and just bought two of the same sizes screws as well.  But I didn't think it was needed.

3) the shutting down issue is unfortunate.  I haven't had yet.  All I can say and I'm sure you will agree is when this board works it's amazing.  Electrical problems can arise with any electric skateboard.  I hope you get your problem fixed soon by their repair agent and make a video again about how the raptor is doing.  

4) I had a handle with mine, i like it.  Some people won't like it.  


@furryfrog all belt drive systems I've had have resistance from their drive train.  So it won't be like a normal longboard to kick push.  However the raptor has the least resistance out of the 3 belt drive system boards I've had.  I have a video on my enertion raptor review thread showing it how works as a normal longboard.  I wouldn't use any electric skateboard as a normal longboard though, but if I had to do it I would rather do it with the raptor than other belt drive boards.

Since I emailed direct and got no response in 4 days I'll post my reply here. 

Jason I wanted to address your points one by one. First I want to say that when I was initially looking at electric skateboards boosted was never an option. It doesn't compare to yours.

1. I have an email from your people that states the handle was included at one point but no longer. It was not in my box and is why I emailed about it. (Screen shot below)

2. The missing screws did not matter to me at all. I brought it to your people's attention so people that it would matter too would have them.

3. I didn't expect to have to hunt around for directions for the remote and would have assumed at least a simple printout would have been included. That would have been fine.

4. Your warranty is great and I have no complaints about that.  I didn't expect mine to have problems the first weekend though.

5.  I have only been to your forums a couple of time mostly just trying to research skateboards. I didn't feel 5 days is fast enough when I'm sitting around with a new broken board.

6. I don't have a problem with you building these in your garage or an overpriced warehouse, it is still going to be people at a workbench doing it by hand. I have watched some of your videos but that's all besides your website.

Final.

     I would prefer a refund.  If I bought a board from Walmart for 100.00 and it broke after 20 miles I would not be surprised.  A 1500.00 hi performance board I waited 3 months for not expected.

I appreciate your time.

What does the bottom button on the remote do?
If it does indeed cause the brake to come on fully then that would be a bad thing - curious about that part.
And wow, those wheels look pretty bad for 20 miles. I have done hundreds on mine and sure, a few small cuts - but no chunks have come off yet.
I do feel for the guy, we may mostly be DIY board builders and take a lot in our stride and be prepared to fix a lot of the issues without a hassle. If someone who wanted to buy a complete E-board and looked on the internet, found Jason's site, bought the board and then had the problems mentioned I can well expect them to be pretty unhappy. I definitely do not always look on DIY forums to see if what I am buying is properly documented or how to fix it if it immediately breaks.
Personally I think he was very fair and understanding. A lot of people who buy something for that sort of money and find it breaks within an hour would not be so understanding. So kudos to him for that.

Great looking board and I can imagine it must be the dogs bollocks when it is working well. I hope sandbound gets it fixed and can enjoy the board but can also understand if he decides on the refund.

good points, I think Jason should have a disclaimer that the raptor is not really just a buy it and forget it board.  It's for people who are willing to do things like adjust belt tensions and motor alignments and some very basic work.  I'm sure many people who are not into fixing things at all will find his board and just order it, these are the same people who ship their boosted board back to them for things like swapping a belt.  That's not who the raptor is for.

I beg to argue on the maintenance issue.  He sells the board as a complete and thus it should go out in the best quality that he can produce.  Sure there can be faults which in actual fact are probably a small number,  but we arent really talking about lots of raptors out there anyway which makes it more of an issue. Tweeking things is only a given.  I check my bike all the time its no different there. If I cant fix it then its the sellers responsibility especially if its a fault. 

In hindsight he probably should have held release back with more user testing base.  All the early tests prior to release was mostly based on his riding fron past posts. 

Its lucky he has mostly understanding customers and also for him he is trying to make good his claim of trying to make the best board. And backing warranty.  No issues there. Hes a big part of the movement he is building.  This forum wouldnt exist. 

For $2200 odd dollars incl tax AUS if not more for others it is disappointing to have such issues,  and sandbound isnt the first.  The thing he has created is amazing when it works. Its the issues that just dont help the cause, especially when it fails after 20 miles for 1 example. 

I havent checked my Raptor 1.0 B1 yet,  but if you have one I would check that vesc pin,  vesc battery limit settings,  and motor coils.  These issues worry me the most.  IMO.

When I fell off after hitting the emergency brake button that really pissed me off especially going down hit with the throttle off coasting (that's only when that brake seems to work)  The board worked after that.  I have no doubt that one of the vescs is the issue (probably) since it stopped working 100% until I put the plastic between the board and the wires. Now it stutters or jitters?  A refund was offered as well as repairs and that is very fair. I asked for a refund because I don't have confidence in it anymore.  I think it was rushed to get orders out but I didn't really comes to this forum before hand before I bought it.  Adjusting belts/motors is something I have no problem in doing just like brakes on a car they will need maintenance at some point. The car broken after 20 miles I don't expect. Not what I'll get. Boosted is not an option. I don't think it's the best at anything but marketing.

I agree. The raptor complete is being sold to a market segment that is expecting a complete board. The price point reflects that. The word complete reflects that. There is confusion that 'adjustable' equals 'prepare for faults'. All boards need maintenance, but belt adjustments and bearing replacements are not the issue here. All boards are exposed to manufacturing faults- the question in buyers minds is what's the realistic the reliability? Sure, only VESC boards are adjustable in terms of settings (without hacking) because they are open source, and thus can be tweaked. But the expectation is 'working' regardless and adjustability shouldn't be confused with reliability. Even using the term DIY on a complete is confused and seems to be an easy out if things don't work as they should. Early adopters in batch one would expect some teething issues and perhaps take it in their stride. The people committing now are probably going to be a little less forgiving, because no matter how you spin it, they are paying for a working board. I'm not saying the raptor isn't reliable- only the manufacturer knows the reported failure rate, and happy riders are too busy riding to post, but I don't think we should use DIY as a term to explain failures or to explain away people's dissatisfaction (the guys review was very balanced even though he was frustrated).

Also, this is why these small outfits deserve to make profit (if you recall that thread). Profit = investment back into reliability/ QC/ pre-sales testing/ service. Raptor gen 4 or 5 will be a vastly superior beast, mark my words, because enertion will reinvest.

Heres my opinion to it:
My initial thoughts when buying the raptor where:
Ill spend my money so I get a complete Board and can then learn about what parts there are and so on. I didnt have any experiences and I am not too skilled at handworking around mechanics.
I had to learn everything by videos and reading, trying out myself and this because the wheels where starting to crack on the sides. I wrote Jason and he instantly offered me another set of wheels for free.
I got convinced to buy the Abec 11 flywheels (83mm 75a) from other experiences and then did so.
I was concerned about whether Ill manage to get everything right without literally screwing things up lol.
So I sat down and did everything step by step and I really think everyone can do this if I can.
The wheels are already changed. This is so easy and it only takes a few steps to do (thinking about doing a video on it) but what really bugged me and what I was unprepared for is the belt tension and the motor positioning.
It is actually quite simple to adjust and with a little bit of practice it should also be doable for every "noob".
I had no tools whatshowever. I am 20 and moved out over a year ago and since then I always borrowed any tool needed but now that I really wanted to drive I tried fixing it with a Leatherman, working in stupid angles, needing too much pressure and so on.
So my recommendation for any future eskate and raptor owner, get the tools you need. 
I just bought em and it is 100000% easier to adjust things (10mm wrench especially for motor adjustment).
If you are hyped while waiting, read up on the raptor first impression thread. There are surely interesting videos about to come!

So when is the right time to release a product? some of the issues might never be found until you have customer feedback.

Here are some reassuring facts.

1. The raptor is the fastest production board available in the world.
2. The raptor is cheaper than boosted boards & has nearly 3 times the range.
3. The raptor has the best warranty of any currently available electric skateboard in the entire world, 12 months replacement on **any** parts. (evolve & boosted boards is 6 months)
4. The raptor is the only truly modular design with many spare parts available for much lower cost than any mainstream alternative, in fact, you can buy spare parts for the raptor from multiple alternative retailers! you don't have to deal with enertion if it is not practical. Every single part is swappable. You could also get your own custom spare battery made by any number of custom battery makers. All at much lower prices than the mainstream brands.
5. There are currently two US based (west & east coast) repair agents & One EU (Belgium) repair agent for raptors (more coming soon)
6. The Raptor is made available for people to purchase world wide.
7. There is a huge online community of people who are available 24/7 who can help with any questions relating to maintenance & repair, this is unparalleled by any other mainstream competitors because they all use proprietary hardware.
8. The Raptor has an open source motor controller that is completely customizable by the user, to meet their exact needs.
9. The CEO of the company is at hand to discuss most issues when they arise.


I am a 2-year-old business running out of my garage, Yes I have lots to learn & many more mistakes to make before I will claim to be perfect... However, I will not stop selling my creations, My products will continue to be improved & reiterated, I will continue to reinvest every cent of profit back into these products until I have the world's best electric skateboard platform. 


So people can choose to buy my products or they can choose another product...... our boards will always be sent out tested and working to our best ability, however sometimes shit happens.... and if it does we will not hide from you, we will offer resonable options and work with you to fix any issues....Once you are my customer you will never be left out of pocket for issues...

[/quote]

Most likely your slave vesc is shot. The jittering is caused by the traction control being enabled. To proove this you can do a quick test, give the board a push start and you will see you can get rolling. Actually, the slave MCU may be shot. You will need to disable the traction control in the BLDC tool.

But you will be running off a single motor. Get that slave vesc replaced

Id just like to keep putting my hand up as a beta tester for the next gen Enertion product once again.  Raptor 2.0  Glad you chimmed in with such precise points.  I was never in doubt about your commitment and motivation about esk8 or your product. You have come to the party when Ive  needed it.   Everytime you have stepped up and backed Raptor owners.  As sandbound was saying he just felt he lost faith in the safety of the product so early. Sure you can fix it,  but in the mind of the customer they need to build their own confidence back and sometimes they cant at all after an initial bad experience.   All you can do is keep doing what your doing.  Just copy your last post points anytine a Raptor owner has an issue.  That will reassure them.

Sorry for the delay, what email did you send to? support@enertionboards.com


if you are wondering what your options are you can read the terms & conditions:

http://www.enertionboards.com/shipping-returns/
http://www.enertionboards.com/pages/enertion-boards-terms-conditions.html


In summary, if you return the goods (at your own expense) to Australia in unused & original condition we will refund you, however we don't offer refunds on used items so this will likely limit your options. 

We are happy to help you find a buyer though and serve as an intermediary. 

You got the raptor for a heavily discounted price, according to your order you only paid approx $1460 USD (current retail price is approx $1600usd) 

Basically, we will process your refund once the new buyer has paid us the agreed amount & you have confirmed shipment to our us based repair agent. We will clean up the board & test it, then forward to the new owner.

you won't lose any money... we will find a buyer and you can get a refund.... technically I am the guy that loses the money.

ALSO, your board was not "rushed out" it has a manufacturing fault that is covered under the comprehensive 12 months warranty. However, you are not willing to have it repaired so we must look at alternative options.

Fact of the matter is this could've happened to a Boosted Board, GT, or any board you could think of... I've seen Boosted's that came in the mail with battery DOA and they had to send it back. I've seen GT's come with all sorts of issues on arrival or after limited use, most fixable by user, very few needed to be sent in.

With the Raptor I'm not too surprised there are issues due to the bleeding edge tech that's in it and the fact that Jason doesn't have a warehouse full of QC people with experience that aren't rushing to get boards out the door. Every esk8 company has had a board go out that's flawed and had to be sent back for service. Unless you plan to drop esk8 altogether, just know theres always that risk. 

I totally understand what you mean it sucks to have issues out of the box, but sometimes you're just the unlucky egg. Your board could get repaired and work flawlessly, but you'd never know unless you gave it a shot. Just my .02

Yes you are 100% right.  Any board could but I got an email with a video sent to me after mine had already stopped working about a short where the wire gets punched through the shielding and arched our on other pins on the circuit board. If I knew how to post a photo I would. It will happen to every board released until that point. 20 or 30? Don't know. Seems kind of obvious even before it's ridden

I honestly think you just bought the raptor as an impulse buy and your heart really isn't into E-sk8.  If it was you would have at least taken the option to get it repaired.  I have been board-less for weeks at a time waiting for repairs, but because I'm actually into E-sk8 I was willing to wait and get my board adjusted rather than just saying I want a refund.  In your situation I would not demand a refund... I spent nearly 2 grand and waited 3 months, I would not mind getting it fixed and actually using the product I ordered and waited so long for.  Demanding a refund just shows you really weren't that committed when you bought the raptor.  Also 3 out of the 4 e-boards I've had needed to be sent in to get repaired or something adjusted (including the main stream and most reliable boosted board), surprisingly the raptor is the only one that has had no issues yet.  .

I don't think shaming the guy is the answer @Photorph. I wasn't into esk8 until I started riding...hard to be into something you've never tried. Thankfully my first board lasted a long time no problems, I could understand the frustration if it stopped working just as I was having fun. That being said I'm still curious as to what @sandbound plans to do if he goes through with the refund. Dropping esk8 altogether because the experience wasn't so great the first time around would be a shame. The only somewhat quick alternative is Boosted if you get a used board or refurbished

@sandbound did they say they can't fix that at all? I'm sure LHB could work up a fix for that. As far as other boards being affected everyone is aware now of the issue so can't they prevent it? Don't see what other boards being affected has to do with you being able to get yours fixed

Didn't mean to shame him.  I guess I should say just say that in his position I would definitely get the repair done to get the issue resolved after waiting all that time for a raptor.  Going to another esk8 would seem kind of pointless.  I suppose my next best option would the evolve GT if I just wanted something from a big company.  

But yes I'm interested in knowing if he is dropping esk8 all together or picking another option.

I agree. Personally I just wanted to wait things out a bit longer and see when the Raptors would become more available and stable. We forget this industry changes really quick so Enertion, Evolve, Boosted are all going to keep innovating. If I were you, depending on which board you keep, I'd just get an inboard if you're looking for something portable and less hardcore. For me, I'm fine with my bbv1 and GT. The inboard looks awesome but I live in such a hilly area with rough roads it'd be pretty lame. Even with 97mm wheels I still get jolted but every crack. Actually bailed today because I came up on one too fast and couldn't dodge. Think I'll be going AT for a while. You have a lot of flats and decent pavement so inboard would work out I'm sure.

I will email him asking for parts to be sent to me.   Missing handle and one vesc at least.  It's not that I can't fix it its just the point.  I have some interest from Craigslist ad so we will see. There are other boards besides boosted.  If they had longer range that may be an option.  Evolves new gt looks good. U.S. distributer in southern California so that is a big plus. Boosted is 1 hour away also. The 20 miles I got to ride was great,  maybe I could buy 2 e-go's and connect everything together? Just kidding

Raptor to (carbon?) GT is definitely not a down grade. From a technical standpoint though the Raptor is faster and more powerful, however the difference shouldn't be that big. If you are a speed demon like me, I'd keep the Raptor and get it fixed. If you go with the carbon GT it will be quite the wait. The bamboo is shipping not too long from now  but it is less powerful than the carbon...

Boosted is great if you're a commuter in the city, but if you ride these things for recreation I'd stick with the Aussies. I only mention Boosted because they are the most reliable and will pretty much never break down unless you treat it like shit and ride it in the rain. Whatever you do, hope you definitely keep skating. It's an irreplaceable experience :)

Sandbound has lost faith in the product. He doesnt have to say anymore.  Sure it can be fixed,  but then there is always that doubt.  Its not like hes paying a few hundred for it. Theres an expectation rather than having it also to go back and forth all the time. When does it become a faulty product.  

Sounds like theres options to get funds back.  I hope he has a better time next time,  but the wait for these things are painfull which also doesnt help when things go wrong.

Im like @photorph.  Taken so long to get willing to try letting them fix it.  Now if you then have other issues well then further consideration may be needed if you want to keep it. 

A guy has used one for 4hrs in total and now wants to sell it.  Works.  Just hasn't used it.

Hey dude, I've been reading your posts and totally understand how you're feeling. I had wanted to talk to you earlier but went on a business trip and vacation hoping your problem will get resolved. I think it's only fair I chime in now because you're feeling incredibly frustrated. 

A little background; I had only ridden my Raptor for 30 mins before the battery's on/off button was broken due to the battery manufacturer fault. I was beyond pissed. Took about 5-6 days to get the whole issue resolved, but I was practically bombarding @onloop to get this issue rectified immediately. To his credit, Jason was incredibly helpful, although I must say that his inexperience with shipping and business dealing does show but I'm digressing. 

Here's what I want to say to you, KEEP the board. I promise you, it is worth it. There is no board on the market that can currently compete with the Raptor. It's confusing dealing with a new business owner but you and I can see @onloop is really working his ass off to satisfied our needs. 

No one in this forum has yet to address to you how the warranty repair is done so I'll explain how it would go down if you should decide to keep it. You'll send the board to @longhairedboy in Florida on your cc. Then you'll send the receipt to @EnertionSupport email. They'll reimburse you the cost. How the reimbursement is done will be between you and the company. (I sent mine in overnight shipping ~$50 but that's on my dime. I never asked for reimbursement because I know overnight is not part of the warranty, but maybe you can work something out with Jason.) 

After that, Damon will fix your board, usually within a day or two if time permitted. But he's always reachable on email so message on this forum for his email and he should update you on the status and what the issues are. After all the known issues is fixed, he'll ship it to you via 2 day shipping if you request it. 

When all is said and done, you'll only lose out ~$30? on shipping should @enertionsupoort not reply your email. But you'll get a complete and fixed board in 7-9 days if there is no big issues with stocks. 

My advice to keep it is a practical one because the time it takes to go the other routes, you'll be able to get this entire mess fixed. It really is a hell of a board. Sleep on it, think it through. Whatever you decide at the end of the day, it should be on how happy you'll be. This hobby is an expensive one, but so is other hobbies, don't give up so quickly and you will be rewarded :wink:

Edit: I'm also missing my handle too, not a big deal but I do want to have it ship to me down the line when @onloop is not as busy anymore.

These Esk8 are incredibly addictive whether DIY or completes.  I keep going on about it,  but what other piece of kit can get you powering up a hill at pace.  The Raptor is a beast when  its workiing.

Glad @Nate that your enjoying the ride.

Cant agree more. 
@photorph I too didnt know if my heart were with esk8 before I didnt try it, I just bought it by "impulse" but enjoyed it ever since.
I understand @sandbound to the fullest because I had some issues to, which where easily fixable and I didnt expect any of it. Kind of ruined it in the beginning but at the moment where you took it apart a few times and put it back together the way you like it, especially when testing out and stuff, it grew personal very fast.
Now I hope everything stays in place and works flawless as it used to til now after fixing everything.
I am still scared of falling at 40kmh+

Nice explanation.  So is your raptor all set and working good?  Good think Jason found LHB in the US, otherwise the repairs would have been a pain!  

P.S. I saw that green and yellow AT build on LHB's instagram, that thing looks sick! Not sure if it's yours though.  With those motors and that gear ratio on 12s it might do 90% inclines lol.

Ya it is. I was not able to take it with me on my flights due to its battery limitation but I can't wait to be back New York in a few hours and take it out for a spin.

I've always try to avoid the debates between DIY and completes because I don't think it's a fair comparison. One can build a DIY to specialize in tackling problems, a complete board basically has to be a jack of all trades. The fact that the Raptor is able to meet most of my needs so far is a testament to its creator @onloop (quality control notwithstanding). Let's see if he can surprise us more with future iteration of the Raptor. :relaxed:

Ya my Raptor has been working pretty well since the battery issue was resolved. I tighten the belts but I haven't had the chance to max out the speed yet, maybe I'll try it later today :grin: I'm gonna keep everything stock until I finish my evaluation of the board. 

And no, that's the Hornet. I ain't the lucky bastard to own that board but it looks awesome. It definitely looks unique enough to turn head I'm sure lol, looks kinda like Ninja turtle to me :turtle:

Nate's is up next along with another guy who has a very similar build that's covered in EL wire.  I've got a Jame's Kelly pro model build that's happening right this minute as it has a deadline and needed more attention (ITS THE LAST ONE I'M DOING ON THIRD PARTY DECKS), the green hornet build is for another customer. It's pretty insane. All of them are basically waiting on parts. Decks and boxes are no longer a hold up, I have deck pressing and sculpting down to a science, channeling is being handled by a FREAKING ROBOT on my back porch and boxes are being fabbed by a third party, so my biggest time sink now is detailing and waiting on parts.  I'm still working on my "ticketing system" so to speak so occasionally i forget to order or forget i already ordered something and have to dig through emails which is a pain but its getting there, and dealing with RMAs on bad parts can be a pain. 

but to stay inline with this thread, The raptor is definitely worth the price tag. In my opinion its the best off-the-shelf board there is. @onloop  has done a wonderful job with his business model and i'm glad i get to help him out and bring the future to the people while still carving out my boutique custom niche using his drive train components.
