Ive been skating for years.  I bought a chinese AT board about 4 months ago . i use it to commute to work occassionaly. The majority of  the time I ride it aggressively after work to let the stress of the day go. So today I get off work and its finally not raining in Texas . I grab my board and proceed to surf it on the normal path that loops around a decent sized park. On the return trip i see a grassy jump just off the path but their are a few obsticles to dodge so i dont hit it sideways and case the landing. I hit it I was going faster then I realized and upon landing stayed on the throttle and slid out.  The whole time i was falling I kept thing tuck and hit the brakes . It worked. Boards fine I'm fine. Just make sure to wear your helmets and protective gear . and always remember to engage your brakes so your board doesnt run away after a whiskey throttle situation.  Cheers ðŸ¤™

Edit: grammatical errors as always woth my posts

Glad youre ok man. 

cant wait till the e-stop featre from the feather remote is standard amongst all the remotes (0-ing ppm value if a significant distance from the board is recorded)

I could be wrong about that being the e-stop feature, thats just what I remembered it to be :thinking:

Those are good and fine Ive had many falls like that but the most scary falls are the ones that don't even give you time to think. I fell at 30mphish so fast that I really had no time to react my helmet hit the ground hard like it was the end of a whip. Broken Board, Broken Ruroc and a lot of bruises but I'm alive to ride again.

Thats sounds amazing . I've seen something similar with jet skis. They slow and turn around .

Yeah I'm okay, I never ride with out a helmet, a good friend passed away from a head injury in 2017 and ever since then I take safety very seriously. His memory has saved my life more than once now.

Update.  My airless wheels lost traction on a corner going 20mph.

Glad it wasnâ€™t worse, hereâ€™s what a high 20mph wreck in shorts looks like.

Maybe I've been lucky. 

Not to one up or anything, but my board just came out from under me at 49mph. One second I'm enjoying the rush of wind the next the stars and pavement stars pavement stars pavement stars.

Hurt for a bit but nothing strong ibuprofen and a couple weeks couldn't help me cope with. 

I've since decided 35mph, 40 max is probably sufficient. 

Safety gear? Glad I had it on.

Jesus Christ! You guys totally need to up your protection. Everything you've scraped up I'm padded up on. I'm scared of shoulder/collarbone injury. Got no protection there, seen a lot of broken bones in that area

Im too broke to buy that gear, but everytime I do decide to go out for a ride, I wear 2 sweaters, wear some tsg knee pads, some sector nine leather gloves, and a helmet. To my luck, @Bobby gave me a full face helmet that was given to him by @topcloud, and now I donâ€™t have to worry about eating it, after the numerous times I ran into guard rails and pot holes. Canâ€™t wait to go back to riding!!

At first, I rarely wore any gear, learned my lesson going almost 50mph on my downhill board and breaking my leg. As much as I do want to buy all this gear and stuff, itâ€™s so expensive! Iâ€™ve been using my downhill division stuff I had from the past that Iâ€™ve collected over the years and itâ€™s done me fine.

Both, slightly downhill and board geared for 45mph weighted. I didn't take into account that going downhill I may hit beyond the weighted speed, got going faster and faster, but having not dewedged the rear or tuned my bushings, I was in a bad spot riding 50degree front and rear in terms of inherent stability. I've since either de-wedged, ran 35 degree rears, or not geared above 35mph weighted.

Let it serve you well!!! Just be sure to pass it on IF you ever decide an upgrade. I kind of like the idea of a traveling helmet helping keep people safe until they can afford a new one

Dude, this helmet is amazing, going to buy a tsg as soon as I buy new furniture for my room, and itâ€™ll be heading to a new home.

95% of the time I go out fully padded up.
This means full face helmet (TSG Pass), motorcycle jacket with integrated elbow, shoulder and back pads (Dainese Air Flux D1), slide gloves (TSG stelvio)  and knee pads (TSG sk8 DHP).

The thing is as the weather gets hotter wearing all that stuff starts to become uncomfortable especially for shorter runs. When I keep moving it is not so much of a problem but if I stop at a traffic light for more than 30sec in the sun at 35degrees I start sweating like a pig.

I have been thinking about using a half shell and slide gloves during the summer but I am having second thoughts.

The more I ride the more comfortable I get and my boards get more reliable so the chances of falling are less. 

On the other hand I have started to ride a lot faster which means that when the inevitable does happen the consequences are likely to be bigger.
