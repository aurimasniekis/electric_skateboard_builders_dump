This is so sad to see.....

First boosted boards get directly copied, now mellow...

Please support the original designers or build your own eboard!, boycott this ripoff company!

Thats really sad!
On the other hand it's impressive/scary to see how fast the Chinese industry can develop/copy products.

Don't be. I backed Mellow because of the innovations (e.g. rheostatic secondary brake) and high-end quality that they've invested in the product. They've undergone multiple iterations to perfect the product, and i know that 100% of dev and manufacturing is done in Munich. 

The Chinese will surely reverse engineer Mellow Drive, but they have to wait in line behind the backers to buy their own first. Whatever is in Alibaba, other than similarly colored wheels, has absolutely nothing from Mellow. You might notice the hub wheels on the front trucks, instead of on the one with the battery/ESC. 

On the hand, now that Hydroflex has dropped out, every single component of Inboard's M1 is made in China. Harder for them to control quality, and easier to pirate. Moral of the story: don't be surprised if the M1 is the next on Alibaba - and not just am empty look-alike, but an actual 1 to 1 copy with cloned tech.

Edit: changed "rheumatic" to "rheostatic". Damn you autocorrect.

Wow that was a fast rip-off.  I haven't even seen the real one yet.  The manufacturing might be good though.  Might not be. 
The original was very expensive. 
How's the rheumatic brake work and is it worth it?  What is high-end quality about the mellow board?  I hear them say "made in Germany" but that's pretty empty. 

I see the motor's on the other wheel. China seems to do goofs like that often in advertisements. The hub motor company on alibaba has their trucks backwards

[/quote]

I don't think rheumatic brake is the correct term. It's called a rheostatic brake and it it functions by sending the current generated by the BEMF through a large resistor which is able to dissipate the power into heat rather than sending the current back to the battery. Unless you live on top of a large hill it seems to be nothing more than a nice marketing gimmick.

It's always a risk to design a new product and put it online before you are ready to deliver. I think Mellow have a good quality product but the prize is too high for most people. So now they have to decide if the are going to outsoarce their production to china as well or focus on quality...

The problem is most people are uneducated about the technology, especially if they have just decided to buy an electric skateboard. They will naturally look for things that are cheaper... They will see that this looks the same as mellow on the aesthetic level...so it must be the same, they think they have found a bargain.... 

it's going to be extremely difficult for mellow to counter this. in my opinion they have a few options.

1. lower their price - they probably can't if they want to produce in Germany
2. educate the market - costly and not effective in the short term
3. change their design and continually innovate - which I doubt will happen due to extremely expensive mold costs.
4. prove their kit is better - has anyone seen a video of it going up a hill?


People will always buy the cheap option first! It's an undeniable human characteristic. The false economy exists because of this, it's in our DNA.

The only way we can counter the recent & relentless china manufacturing hunger for developing cheap eboards is growing the self-built eboard movement.... educating the masses about building awesome **custom** rides! We must focus on exceptional quality, unmatched product performance, amazing service and constant innovation.

China will never understand the intricacy of what makes a really good eboard... they are exceptional at copying but they just don't really know what they are making and why/how it is better.... they don't really get the "cool" factor... masters at the art of copy... not much innovation.

Well, Mellow say that their Product is 8kmh faster than this copy, so it must have either more power or less torq. Besides the high prize of Mellow I see another problem: if you preorder now you will get their product in a year. I doubt that many sk8ters will be that patient, even if the quality is much better...

E-skates is a new market, appealing to the masses, many of whom have never set foot on a board. Boosted must have decided to go without the "marketing gimmick" because their boards shut off in the situation you describe. 

Not good for a newb on a downhill who can't footbrake. 

Oddly enough, Boosted HQ isn't far from San Francisco, where there are quite  a few hills, with people living atop them. C'mon, when you advertise uphill torque, shouldn't you plan for the downhill on the other side? 

Aside from capacity, there's rate of charge: even if your cells have room to take a charge, hard braking might send too much, too fast. Rheostatic brakes will dissipate the excess, so braking will always be strong.

You and Mellow agree: quality and features. There's no better advertisement for the original than buying a cheap crap copy and realizing that you just threw your money away. 

Mellow could have just opted to be the first powered truck and slammed it out in one iteration, but instead, they deliberately aimed to be the *best*. First... best....at the end of the day, which would you rather have under your feet? 

Hub motors' are already at a relative disadvantage to indirect transmission in terms of torque . Onloop, I you said that Chinese ESC development isn't quite there yet. Now add to this a swappable battery clattering about underneath with dubious dust/water ingress protection? The general public might be fooled into buying, but will have a bad time afterwards. 

... 

One of the first videos showed the uphill, not very quantifiable, but they also said they've increased total torque from 3 to 3.4Nm. With sealed motors and a 2 years, I'm betting they know a thing or two about managing excess heat system wide.

My next video will be how to make your own electric skateboard motors. 

step 1) buy an R-SPEC or Tacon or NTM
step 2) use chemicals found at Lowes to strip off the anodize and branding
step 3) stamp your own brand on the can
step 4) sell them for $300 each and say they're the world's first something or other and talk about how they're better than the original motors because reasons you make up.  Its not criminal fraud, its just good marketing.

I don't know, isn't this is the sort of system we have all bought into. At least here in the U.S.  Many would say this is capitalism at it's best (worst?)... Maybe for the electric skateboards industry at this point and time this is a huge bummer, but if China wasn't mass producing nearly everything we use in a much more efficient, and cost effective manner the cost for everyday goods would be through the roof or we would have to find a much better way to do things. This leads to cheap garbage products sometimes, and they often utilize unethical labor practices as well, so I am not saying that I personally support these ideals or practices, but it seems this is what its come to unfortunately. 

Don't a great majority of the sellers even on this forum look to factories in china for mass producing their products? Are not many of them fairly close representatives of the competition with only mild changes or innovations? I'm not saying this is right, but this is what ultimately drives prices down and brings products into the mass market nowadays. Unless you're in an industry like pharmaceuticals with insane trade protections ( and even they are far from immune to this effect) you are highly subject to this type of market behavior, and most people won't even bat an eye.

I bought cheap Chinese products through manufacturers on alubaba a couple years ago when buying carbon bike frames.  I've now bought 3 carbon frames directly from China manufacturers.  The story is long but the point is China makes some great stuff as well.  These are not copies but better designs with better engineering not even available here. No joke.  Carbon dropout all aero tube shapes compact frame set with the huge bearings for 350$. As stiff as a board and light as a feather. Insane. This would be 3500$ if it was even for sale here.  

   You can't talk about what China produces as if they're all the same.   China just like alibaba, u can get scammed in a moment or find a great manufacturer.  Direct to manufacturer.  

What the hell is the magic of German engineering.  I don't trust anyone's claims to anything.  A 2 year warranty is legit thought but shippiing.

I am not so sure about that, but if it is true mellow has no one else to blame! they have fucked up hard!...

IMO My gut feeling is that these Chinese-based electric veichile companies do market research constantly to see what is the next "big" thing they can mass produce, I would imagine they are keeping a close eye on all the successful Kickstarter campaigns. They see something they like & because they are experts at manufacturing they can go from concept stage, tooling, to production very rapidly. So they simply copy the aesthetic design, make some molds & install the stuff that is available in the market. Bang! you now have a product ready for mass market.

I am actually very impressed & amazed, the product looks good, So not to take away anything from the Chinese at all!

Also, I do think in many cases some of the Chinese factories are actually developing much of their stuff from the ground up to make it as good as they can. They are just really quick at it & Mellow are not as quick! But mellow are probably doing more proper testing and china are maybe guess-testing.

Mellow has zero, zip, nada outsourced to China. All development is in-house, and thanks to Germany's plentiful lodes, even the magnesium is mined in Germany. Painfully aware of what China can do, they took the high road form the beginning, not just for quality, but to avoid piracy. 

If you think Mellow is what it is simply because they had the stupidly obvious idea to attach the battery pack to the truck you've missed the point. 

So here's the point in two steps:
1. Integrating battery to the drive is a no-brainer, so let's do it.
2. Because it's a no-brainer and because we as German surfers/boarders love high performance, long-lasting mechanics, we are not only going to over-engineer it, but future-proof and China-proof it.

Boom.

So here's China's reasoning:
1. Looks good, copy/paste that .jpg and make it a CAD, let some cheap molten aluminum flow, and squeeze components from other e-skate builds inside.
2. Sell sell sell

Btw, the Chinese factories that make Boosted's parts are indeed re-selling the tech. I think the only reason that Inboard's not being copied is because they either (1) aren't as far along as they say they are or (2) they are bringing nothing new to the table.

According to Inboard's Facebook, their CTO should be in China around this time to bring back the first batch of motors. Apparently the sensors where all attached in the wrong place on the last prototypes. Not convincing.

But magnesium may not be as good as aluminum.  Yea it's light and strong but corrodes very quickly and in the bike world isn't used anymore for this reason. Once the paint is scratched and it's exposed it's on it's way. 
Any assumption about superior engineering or materials in Germany vs China is just dare I say racist if not a huge assumption.  If someone could at least point to a concrete example of the smooth board's great engineering then we would be talking about something real.  What are the batteries and esc and motors? From the video they do it doesn't look like they're up to rocket science.  "German Engineering" is a statement that means nothing other than you're probably having to pay a lot and it's probably due to their socialistic high taxes. 

I think copying smooth board was an obvious move, the cost is way more than what it could cost to make and still they did really well on Kickstarter.

Engineering is a big name for a not-too-complicated piece of machinery.  If they'd explained how or why their product is better then they'd have something.  But in the eskate world it's all claims and no numbers

before I comment in *extreme* detail i think i need more clarification from you... but obviously there are some things that are not feasible to produce in-house. bearings, bushings, wheels, grip tape, battery cells, wire... 

At the end of the day the enertion business for me is about creative thought process, awesome design & grouping things *(off the shelf & custom made parts)* together in a way that is unique to my brand! **Gathering of things** together that would be otherwise extremely difficult for the individual to achieve on their own & leveraging suppliers to scale with growth & satisfy demand. I don't do any manufacturing in house.

There will always be a procurement role in any business. Whether it's the raw material or a finished product.. You can't make everything!

Do I only use suppliers that manufacture every single part themselves? NO... does that matter? of course it doesn't! For me it's about the lead times, finished result quality. I dare say if any factory tried to **make everything themselves** the quality would probably decline, if not the service would.

The trick is creating a really awesome product that no one else has & also being able to scale up and produce at a rate to meet demand whilst trying to protect your IP... to do this requires outside supply and lots of strategy & time.

If you got 100 orders of your unique hollow-core eboard design today, Can you do the work yourself in your shop in a timely manner?... Maybe you have to spread the production out over 4-6 months or more, this could result in people going elsewhere & loss of a sale which will ultimately stop your business growing. NOW, if you only outsourced some production you could satisfy demand and hopefully bank some profit that could be reinvested in tooling or HR to allow you to grow bigger & meet the demand better in the future.

**I do respect your ethos...** But somethings are just not feasible for small business. If you can't quickly scale to meet demand you will always be chasing your tail. That is why many businesses, in your words, are; *"merely moving product"*

I don't manufacture anything in my 6m x 8m garage! **Does that mean my business doesn't have heart & soul?**

Haha, Don't worry man I wasn't trying to call you out. You are upfront with what you do and I respect that. I see you as a distributor similar to a premium bike shop vs a bicycle manufacturer. The problem for you is there is not a diverse market full of components that you can stock and make a business off of so you need to rebrand  or have someone manufacture custom designs in order to create your own market. These other companies put up a front when in reality they don't actually make anything. Eventually I think you will grow to accept your role in the scene and who knows, maybe we can mend fences and you will be stocking parts made in New Mexico someday ;)

Hummie, you seem to know about materials, but paradoxically neglect an important aspect: neither magnesium or aluminum are used in pure form, but as alloys. The alloys are there to impart other charateristics to shore up inherent weaknesses, for example, to increase magnesium's self-healing capacities. Also, both materials are subject to corrosion...the self-healing I'm referring to is how each develops an oxide layer or coating that protects the metal underneath.

http://www.aluminiumdesign.net/design-support/aluminium-corrosion-resistance/

Yes, it's a bit generalist to say, but you have the countries first and foremost to blame for that: "Made in Germany" was actually an international campaign to make German engineering (not really a big word) and product synonymous with quality. It worked, mostly due, simply, to the well-engineered products and standards of the internal market. China is now trying to the same thing, and their fight has to start, just like Germany, internally, where lack of quality and cheap products is done by design.

http://thediplomat.com/2015/07/how-made-in-china-became-a-stigma/

You can call it racist, but just think of burning "hoverboards" when you feel you are getting oversensitive.

Batteries are Samsung or Panasonic cells, ESC and motors are custom made in house, because nothing that existed met their specifications, not even the vaunted VESC. Don't feel insulted, just get off that high horse and say, yay, someone's making new stuff.

"Really well on Kickstarter"...creating a product and brand from the ground up in Germany for 370K? In my opinion, they're eating a lot of ramen noodles and bootstrapping it like it was out of style. Their updates said they had additional investments of over a million and a half euros; this was badly needed, I'm sure.

Onloop, aren't you a one-man company? When you say "able to scale up" does that means you are expanding your business to meet a higher demand? 

It's financially impossible for a small business to NOT outsource manufacturing, but for me, the difference is that Onloop is designing his own key components, then assembling, instead of just putting something together from standard and widely available parts.

I'm confused.  I'm not insulted by new products. I have no beef with hoverboards and I don't feel I'm on a high horse and I'm not really complaining of racism, more so just calling it idiocy for people to claim one country's products are better than another.  That's a huge generalization which follows political and racial lines. 

I don't know much about the different alloys but do have experience with what is sold as magnesium.  It corrodes much faster than aluminum typically. Just needs to have a layer of paint that stays on I guess though.  While both will oxidize the aluminum seems to build a protective layer while the magnesium just keeps corroding
And I would say smooth board did really well on Kickstarter.  They succeeded right? Any success is success.  I'm saying from the perspective of a manufacturer in China that can do things cheaply, smooth board is an obvious thing to rip off. I was syched for the thing and then saw the price.

Right now i press my own decks and do my own wire channeling and make my own grip. I'm about to make my own battery packs, and i'm already fabbing my own enclosures. 

But if i got a 100 orders for my Scarlet decks i'd be on the phone with a plant in Atlanta, and if i got an order for 100 completes i'd be on the phone with the bank and just about everyone in Shenzen along with a few local machine shops as well as some people with CAD experience, because at that scale its time to have my own branded parts and it would be more feasible to do so. 

Then after everything was made and delivered, I would assemble everything myself over the course of a couple of weeks because i would immediately take all of my vacation from my job to do it. 

If i got a second order after that i'd probably quit my job and use all of this experience to start using somebody else's money instead of my own and keep the momentum going.

I'm just a guy who's always wanted an e-skate since forever, moreso now that my knees are messed up. I love science and mechanics (not an engineer) but never went down the DIY path because my number one criteria is it has to be under 5 kg. Okay, 6 max. Its urban transportation for me, so I have to be able to carry it around like the skate it is when I do errands. 

I was seduced by the latest crop of Kickstarters: Inboard, Mellow and Stary. Luckily not Marbel (had money problems at the time). I've talked to people in each team since a year and have been most convinced by the responses and mentality of the Mellow guys. 

They've driven through my city in France twice and let me ride. Being able to demo and chat with them has only made me more convinced it's gonna be a great product. 

I'm sort of apprehensive about Inboard, which seems to be 90% marketing and blabla. Concerning Stary, I have a sort of restrained optimism...at 450 USD each (I got two) I should be okay. 

@Chaka and @longhairedboy, Nice to meetcha Mr Impossibles! I'd love to check out your stuff, got a website?

I can't get too upset because I'm not Asian. But it's funny you bring up the hover board.  I have a guess that there's more burnt up evolve boards percentage-wise than hover boards.   Maybe I'm wrong.  

Im still wondering what ur talking about saying that i am insulted and not happy some one is making new stuff and I'm on a high horse.  What horse?  Maybe u thought I'm in the racism horse. I'm not in China but if I worked there and made something pretty decent, which a lot of them do, I'd be annoyed hearing about China as if it was just one unscrupulous sloppy guy.

More so relevant I had motors made in China and I'll bet u the German engineering smooth motors don't have as good components and possibly workmanship as these.  Germany is one place u can get really nice motors and they cost a fortune.

Just some raw footage from the test runs I did a few months ago. Sorry, I wasn't able to do any uphills that night. Check the video's description for timepoints to look at if you skip through it (don't blame you, they are quite uneventful) 

I don't know what ESC was used, but I can ask. The published an update showing the electronics only a month or so ago.  https://m.imgur.com/pRVQjIy

It was a prototype of the new frame design, which has slimmed down in the meantime. The hot swappable battery was cool.

The Mellow guys were on their way to Barcelona to film that 7 Chapters of Awesomeness video.

Lyon. 

The rattling is because I put it on my crappy Sector 9 without bracing it. In the third video I moved the drive to a Chubby Unicorn; no more rattling.

Similar to the rest (except inrunners) I'd say, more than a single motor, but no transmission/belt noise. I'll let you judge for yourself:

Id rather build my own eboard pick my own deck and ask some members here for better parts or some custom work on the deck, etc. Then some of the left over money just buy batteries and more batteries.

this is an interesting topic.

we're right at the beginning of this niche's growth, hopefully it will continue to grow.  what you see today, won't be what's around in 18 months.

the guys here who are making now, will unlikely be the guys making at the end - that's how markets work. there will be many casualties along the way, probably most of all in China. 

the Chinese (generally) don't know how to market (culture, language, skillset), and then they are not great at being close to customers and innovating from feedback - this is where anyone else can win.

the key to survival for anyone is: 
attract enough people who like your UNIQUE product, brand and proposition, to make enough gross margin.
keep your overheads low.
scale with demand at the same gross profit, with maybe a 5% band of change.

most people will fail at the margin part, and then the scale part.
the ones that don't will survive.

it's as simple as that.

Hopefully marketing ends up falling on it's head when tons of stuff is sold that breaks.  Stuff sold in Germany must last 2 years legally I think and for electric board stuff that's a longer time than a lot of stuff lasts..  stuff out of china or america can legally fall apart in moments.  The diy eskate sellers more so get away with selling stuff that falls apart as customers assume or are told it was their fault.
im offering lifetime warranty on the steel hub motors I sell.  If you break a magnet or burn the motor out or need a new bearing youre not covered but otherwise I feel comfortable offering that.

Think marketing + quality trumps. 
Eventually poor quality will burn out.

But most of all, it's hard to make something that appeals to everyone. 

Boosted picked a larger segment than everyone else and made it easy. Mellow haven't done a great job at communicating their proposition, whilst maintaining a price point that will automatically segment them for higher income earners. Which is fine, and in some cases is better than being mass market. 

It's gonna be interesting to watch.

Since I speak german I had a back and forth email argument with the guys from Mellow. I think their pricing is ridiculous to be honest. This industry is taking off and you'll see new products almost every day. And what was special on one day will become the usual on the next. Western companies always seem to go for the exclusive branding and to some degree that pisses me off. Obviously the Chinese couldn't care less about exclusiveness, but that doesnt say that they don't innovate. Even if they just make a good copy for half the price, I call that innovation on my end as a consumer. B/c I personally want the price to go down and E-skateboarding to become a common trend and an affordable consumer product.

So I know you guys claim DIY, but except a couple of guys who actually build their own motors (and eventually sell them)  you can't do nothing by yourself. You buy ready components and put them together. And in terms of Mellow, considering something DIY b/c you still have to screw it on to some deck is pure hypocrisy.

I am looking forward to see a bigger selection of complete boards that are cheaply manufactured by machines and still (or therefor) of good qualiy. Why would I want to spend my time "building" something that a factory does 10 times faster and better? You know that is the idea of a modern industry, you don't have to do it yourself, like the lonely trapper in the woods. And in some sense you guys are stalling the industry with your backward nostalgia and "feeling good about ourselves, b/c DIY". You are not better than anyone who just wants to buy a nice E-board and ride it, so don't pretend to be, it's vain.

DIY allows us to have machines that can do that.  I think many of us would get readymade boards if they could perform as well as DIY and the prices were good.

The guys at mellow have high prices because they are
1) in debt. No company that has 2 years of research, prototyping, and advertising without sales is in a good place financially
2) making high quality products. 2 year warranty is pretty goddamn generous!! They back what they sell, and that's honorable in itself


Innovation is doing something that has never been done before. Calling ripping someone's hard work off and selling it for half the price is not innovation - it's being a greedy asshole.


Finally, this is a DIY forum. We are here not because we think that our boards are better than mass production (a decent amount are though and this has been proven a multitude of times) but because we love to do things! Yea sure a machine can do it 10 times faster but the work is half of the fun! There's no doubt that in building a board you will feel much prouder of your work than clicking a few buttons and dropping a thousand dollars on a production item.

[/quote]


I can't speak for everyone, but for me - this defeats the point.  I like to do it myself - even if someone else can do it cheaper/faster - i get pride from doing it myself.  I learn how it's done, and i feel confident re-doing it (repairing, replacing, upgrading) those components when i did it from the ground up in the first place.  I almost never save $ vs a pre-made, but i get a ton of enjoyment out of doing it myself.  And any actual $ saved is usually put into another thing i want to learn (like vacuum forming or Carbon Fiber/epoxy).

As a consumer i get what you are saying, but as someone who has taken apart fully functional devices - breaking tamper labels and voiding the warranty - to upgrade or just poke around - _before even powering them on the first time..._ it's something you either like or don't.  No shame in buying a polished product like Boosted or Marbel (i have a Marbel, buddy has boosted - both are great), but _so much fun to build your own._  

**You don't have to build your own motor to be DIY**.  That's silly.  Next you'll want me to sift the sand/silica to melt down and make my own PCB's for an ESC - because i'm not doing it myself if i buy one and configure it...

I also am able to build a esk8 on a deck of my choosing - not like many others (not necessarily unique - we copy what we like and others have made).  With the motors i want, with the batteries/range i want, the wheels i want, the trucks i want... A real drop deck setup is pretty rare, and i want to re-create my own e-GBomb (just better).  Custom foam core Subsonic deck made to my specs... not something many (if any) will have besides me.  But folks are welcome to call Scott and have him make them one too!

Different strokes for different folks - not sure we'll see eye to eye on this one.  Off to modify a perfectly good skateboard w/ a router and carbon fiber... which isn't DIY i guess.  :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

wow, miss your meds today or someone piss in your cereal?

I get your passion, just feel it's a bit misdirected.  DIY is not *only* making everything from scratch.  It's building it and learning how to build it better.  How to fix it, how to upgrade it.  Sometimes this is breaking apart a lipo to repack slimmer, or improving on a Boosted board design to make it your own (maybe with thinner enclosures, or more range, or better motors/power).  You are doing it yourself - with your own hands.  And having fun (i hope) learning as you go.

You don't get it.  That's cool.  But you don't show respect for the folks who have pride doing it themselves.  I don't need to know the physics and have an electrical engineering degree to utilize the VESC.  I've repaired, programmed, and supported Vedder from some of the earliest boards he released (my first two were from him).  This is a cutting edge (FOC!) ESC that was built with esk8 in mind!  How cool is it to talk with the guy who built it and send him some $ to help keep him innovating.  Even if i don't understand it at the EE or programming level - i've helped!

This forum is to help eachother.  I've written multiple guides and tutorials, plus countless "here's what i'd do" suggestions to folks with questions.  That's part of the community that doesn't require you to know the difference in ripple current using triple 680uF caps vs a single 2200uF cap!

I'm not sure if you're familiar with "trolling" but coming on a "DIY" (your interpretation or mine) forum and knocking what folks are doing is pretty much a definition of it.

Don't like what folks here do since they are part of "consumer noob club" - help educate some folks and help or go somewhere else.

If you are a true innovator in this community, when you see others innovate, you respect that. I think 1600 euro is too high of a price considering all the knowledge I have now. There's 2 reason I got into diy, other than I like to build things. Because I can choose my deck (didn't like the shape of any of the decks of the premades out there) and I wanted more power and range. If I went back 2 years ago and could have bought a mellow instead of going diy, I probably would have. I'm glad it wasn't an option and I got into diy, and I would never go back now. But you have to respect what they did. These Chinese ripoffs are likely made from mellows designs, with minor tweeks. That is not innovation, that is theft. You don't see them 2 years of research, because they don't care about the quality of their product. 

At the end of the day, you have to respect what other innovators are doing. You can come on here and call us a bunch of n00bs, but you just appear ignorant, because you don't know any of us. I think we were all at that point at some time when we were putting parts together that didn't work out, and broke. And we learned from them, and made better boards the next time. Many of us are on our second or third or higher board. Our boards perform better than any main stream product.

If you want cheap boards, go buy a cheap chinese board, ride it every day and tell us when it breaks. I bet it will be in the first 2 months. Then let us know when you get it fixed by the cheap Chinese manufacture (which will probably be never) or when you fix it yourself (which won't happen if you don't get diy).

You can't just demand everything cheaper. This community did that with vesc's, and see how that turned out? They lasted not even 2 fucking days. Now I buy quality vescs from chaka, and they don't break. Yes, they cost a fortune, but the parts for him to build them are more than the shitty quality vescs were at it's cheapest with markup. If something is cheap, it's because they are building them sloppy, with counterfeit components, and bad engineering and little real world durability tests.

From looking at that product as an example..the market says "we will sell way underpowered but sleek looking pictures of stuff with claims that are largely bunk and we don't actually have anything for sale yet and you might get it in a year" 

 They make claim to be the only motor that goes on an unmodified truck.  But they don't actually sell it and thats what I sell at a fraction of their cost and with lifetime warranty. Yet they will get tons of bucks from people who don't know better.  And then hopefully when they get the board a year from now and find that I blast past them and then go on for another 20 miles silently on FOC, hopefully they will look at diy again.   
It's not me just trying to sell motors  but that the  diy stuff blows all this stuff away.  I crush gts on any terrain.   How much power can you put in any of these Kickstarter hubmotors?  The escs and kv are so geared down its riding on a toy. They're all slow and weak.

The dude trolling is a troll. Leave him be and his trolling will have no audience.

I think Mellow have raised money with VC's - at least that what the picture and google translate told me. That's how they did the 2 yrs or some of it, and it also means thy aren't technically in debt but have sold equity, which is not the same thing. I don't know their term sheet but most deals are equity so don't assume they have big debt. 

Lastly, any market has many players with many consumers - there is never (can you think of an example?) a "one size fits all" product. So most arguments are moot - Mellow are going after a market segment that want German engineering without the putting together part. So what? There are 15 other market segments.

Bottom line: for there to be real consumer benefit, everyone needs to benefit from greater awareness & cheaper parts. Even Audi is trying to make their parts cheaper to produce!

Trolling!?  Do you know the Eon board has 12 cells?  How fast, far, or powerful do you think that will be? 

You may be really into the business aspect of electric skateboards I'm into performance.  it's like the difference between a farrarri and a Honda Accord from 1990 these things verse diy

"German engineering" from smooth board or the rest of the marketing hype...put my or most any diy board against it or any of the commercial boards and they don't perform as well. They don't have the power.    What criteria can you judge with as nothing is even available and you're judging on a fantasy. Behind the show is weak stuff. I'm not trolling but making sure it's put in perspective.  Maybe you're happy going 20mph and slowly up hills and a tiny range for lots of bucks. Maybe all the money goes to the big promotion because the motor materials aren't made of anything special no matter what country it's made in.  With the cost of smoothboard I feel your paying into the socialist system. Cost to imagined performance does it really stack up?
I sell stuff with a lifetime warranty, now, for a board that will crush this stuff, and for cheaper, and you're calling me a troll for bringing attention to it

Your "bottom line" being greater awareness and cheaper parts, that's not smooth board or Eon.  Expensive and at least one of them really misrepresents.  Even smooth boards flaming wheels seem empty hype once u compare it's performance.   When something comes out that's a decent price and has power I endorse it.  Raptor sounds like the best thing out there if it's prebuilt.  It has the most power and runs on vescs.  Gt I've ridden and it's pretty good too.  Boosted I've also ridden a couple times.  Performance counts when you're into riding and I'd rather pay half for so much more by plugging a couple plugs in.

performance is nice if you are able to scale it well. I think the perfect board is something that you may ride as a beginner aswell as a pro. And with the DIY stuff the performance often does seem to come as a raw and brutal force. Maybe you laugh about that, but I want ride modes fE. Even if I get the hang, I don't want someone to break their neck if they try it out the 1st time. So ride modes and smooth acceleration and breaking. I don't want breaks that kick like a horse and throw me off the board. Maybe, just maybe you have the skill to program these Vescs together with the remote so you will find a decent setup, but that may take alot of time and you might still get some bad feedback at times. And bad feedback at high speed is... bad. I'd rather have a professional company behind it that does all the testing and adjustment to make it a save and smooth ride. Even if I had to sacrifice some performance, the savety and overall riding experience is more important to me than the highest top speed and hill climbing ability.

Oo sorry guys.  Peace all.  Got me worked up.  

Different strokes for different folks as was said.
I do get a bit bent when people say how great these well marketed products are as our diy stuff goes under the radar.  The greatest plus of the diy stuff is related to it greater power which is sadly illegal.  If we let our much greater power get too well known we'd get reeled back by the law.

LEGIT concern.  And here's how you do it.  First get a VESC - best and smoothest acceleration and braking i've found (plus regen).

Second - don't set someone on top of your 12s "beast" board setup...  BUT if you must, there's a couple things you can do - lower voltage.  I like 3s batteries (thinner lighter and modular) since i can use 2,3,or 4 for 6/9/12s.  If i'm going to let someone ride my setup i'll remove a pack or two to get 6s - much less "punch" and safer for a newbie.

One of the Tx/Rx's now has two modes - i think it's the benchwheel one.  A selectable button that limits it to go slower.  Not sure - but might be worth testing.

It's a concern of mine too.  When i want someone new to try esk8 i hand them my Marbel in Mode 1 (about 6-8mph tops).  But on DIY (my definition of it likely not yours) - i lower voltage.  My GF who has never skated before, rides a simple 8s single motor setup and loves it.  (200kv 6355, VESC, 8s, Kama).  It'll do much faster than she ever rides (i ride it when other friends ride my Marbel) and it can do 18+ i'd guess, but is very smooth.  If you mash the power - bad stuff can happen regardless of DIY or Boosted/Marbel/etc.  Helmet + wrist guards at a minimum.

recommendations for wrist guards?
i've got some snowboarding ones, but they are huge and don't fit under boarding gloves...

I've tried the triple 8 and pro-tec wrist guards.  They definitely don't fit under gloves, but i've also seen some gloves w/ guards built in - i'll look for a set to link.

I broke my wrist years back (motorcycle accident) so know how much it sucks to have a broken wrist.  And being a big guy (height and weight - 6'8"/2m 265/120kg) - it hurts falling from my height!

hummie, when i said the market spoke i was responding to the previous post prior about pricing/affordability. the buttomline is as you said, different strokes for different folks. i have been getting a headache with deciding which way to go to get an esk8 and i have no prior electrical engineering experience and even though i can piece together the hardest ikea furniture, esk8 based on what preferences i'd rather, stresses me.
Eon solved that in my case(given they deliver whats promised) i have 2 Aileron CF boards one that had for just kicking and another that i bought specifically for eon.
I prolly would DIY at some point(you know i hype hummies on reddit too) when i have time but 3 kids and NYC life makes no time for too much pondering if theres already a readymade that suits my needs.

I thought I sold you a set?!  maybe your pic is similar to someone I met here in sf.    tell us how it goes with the prebuilt but especially if you're a bigger guy keep in mind that since there are only 12 cells in the board so you will have none in parallel to boost the amp ability so you're looking at maybe a max of ..30 amps without destroying the cells quickly.  I could be wrong but I doubt it.  30 amps...especially with hub motors...I run 70 TO EACH MOTOR and I'm happy.   So I have access to like 5 times the power and it's appreciated.

Onloop, glad to see someone understands how supply chains, vendor partnerships, and manufacturing value streams work. No major brand makes all of their own parts - not Boeing, not Apple, not Tesla. That'd be business-stupid.

People should be careful of patronizing China's technological capabilities.  They have incredibly capable engineering and manufacturing organizations there.  It's just that the small esk8 start-ups may be going to the shady ones, many of which use agents and middlemen to draw business.

I am german. The last time i got tricked out by a german company with this "made in germany" thingy was when i bought a 2500 Euro digital LEICA camera. I bought it because the CEO sent out a mailing and told we should support german stuff and german quality. I did. 2 years later the auto focus motor broke. Leica cameras wanted 1400! Euros for the repair. I was Like LOL and put it in the trashcan. Now i use a japanese cam that can do the same and cost 1/3. I do not need a red point on any camera and also no top notch design on a skateboard. The Mellow Board really is very nice and well done but it's too nice and too good imo. And it's no Porsche or a Swiss Watch that can rise it's price over the years. If the Mellow is unboxed and used once the price will be 1/3 less. After 2 years it's trash like every other motor skateboard because the technic goes forward in turbo speed. There are already trucks with build in energy pack. No power-box needed anymore.

@office totally get where you are coming from. The Esk8 market is tough one... Mellow took a longtime to get to market, and mean while other brands came out, the Chinese came out with their own stuff. 

Flash forward to now...more Esk8 options, faster speeds, bigger distance and lower price. A really hard market.

I do talk some of the mellow team. They are trying. The current pay as you play option we met with harsh criticism, but seemed a way to offer the system at a lower price. They offered a free battery as well. It’s not working.

Now what? Pressreset’s latest video about mellow was painful to watch. Definitely not something they wanted on YouTube. 

If they want to be competitive, they just need to lower the price. We all know that’s the problem.

 Slow down there cowboy, We only know of one company that does that and they haven't proven that its a safe or viable method in real world testing. Can't be counting eggs now. 

and I agree with what Michael above said.
