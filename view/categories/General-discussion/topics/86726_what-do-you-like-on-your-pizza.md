Hey peeps,

If you are from the Portland area, please be on a lookout for this Trampa EMTB that was stolen from this guy's storage....clearly an inside job since it was a very specific unit. Was told there was no security cameras. He was totally being watched putting that thing in!

That sucks I don‚Äôt think I would ever people something that I valued in a storage unit. I would only put clothes and furniture. You always hear of people finding expensive things in storage units when they sell off the the units that have defaulted.

I hope they get it back as that is a nice looking board.

I had over 3,000 comic books stolen from a storage lot a few years back.
I hate to even think what some of those are worth I've been collecting regularly since I was a child. Lots of first editions in first appearances.

I think forum engineers should come up with idea of engineering a low power open source gps module which can be integrated into our boards. Tagging @Deodand @rpasichnyk @trampa @torqueboards @JTAG @Ackmaniac @twan @Mich21050 @3DServisas  for opinion on this matter.

The biggest issue with this is that GPS receivers  are passive. So even adding a GPS receiver to the board won't do you much good unless you also have a bidirectional cellular comms of some sort. There are low-bandwidth newer standards like NB-IoT and CAT-M that are just now entering the market though, so I feel like this sorta tech is quite a bit more feasible.

I'm tinkering with a NavCom embedded computer in one of my carvers right now that has a cellular modem integrated, still need to get robust mounting for the GPS module/antenna figured out. This was mostly for some advanced telemetry and logging I'm playing around with, but a 'Lojack' style system could definitely be implemented.

I spoke with Jason D today on this, unfortunately it was more than just his board that got stolen. I think he might actually be covered under the insurance of the storage facility so it's not a complete loss. It didn't have the battery in it either. We're on the lookout for anything getting posted on local OfferUp/Let go/CL.

He will ride again, regardless. But man people suck.

So I may be wrong and don't want to start a witch hunt but I'm in the Portland area and am seeing this board on OfferUp that looks mighty similar. Maybe someone could point out a difference between them if I'm wrong. https://offerup.co/YGxdmaiBCW![Screenshot_20190511-222301|281x500](upload://nirdFQVlvDPN1fStECBGgWDoKKa.jpeg)

Some people man........ absolutely sickening, and from a storage unit even? I really hope some people get out some GPS/tracking stuff developed to keep our boards safe, and if stolen, more chance of recovery. We need some sort of system like phones s/ns and such for esk8s to prevent the sale of stolen boards.

Warring chit advice incoming.

If you're 100% it's your board send someone the remote in poland and have him just drive off with it.
but let's just hope the boards going to be charged.

because once an item is stolen and shipped over seas the whole i bought it off someone else drama applies. So don't ask if you don't wanna take no for an answer sometimes you gotta shoot first talk later. but yet again this probs chiet advice that could get people hurt.

I am in 100% agreement sometimes you just do whatever you need to do to rectify the situation.  If it's yours, take it back.  It can be proven later that it's yours.

Make sure the transfer is in a place with video surveillance and that someone else knows where you are going and have copies of all relevant contact information and follow you (a few blocks away).

And always know they might not be trying to sell you a stolen skate, they might want you to show up with cash so they can rob you.  Without even a skate there, because they left it at home.

Also, I hope whomever stole this gets hit by a bus and doesn't die, but is in excruciating pain the rest of their life, without health insurance.

Honestly my favorite pizza is plain cheese and I believe it's the ultimate test of all pizza places.
If you can't make a slice of cheese pizza damn good, there's no point in putting anything on top of it.....

I‚Äôve always like thin crust, there was a small pizza place I use to always visit for Neapolitan, the owner was a Mexican guy who went to culinary school in Italy and came to the US to open a restaurant. It was absolutely great but he closed down. I had my first real Italian Neapolitan pizza in Italy a few months ago and it was just as good. Sucks I can‚Äôt find another place near me

The only way I think ranch would be good with pizza is if you roll it up, batter it and deep fried it. I love ranch with onion rings, that's about it.

@Bobby That's what I like about those DIY/custom pizza places, pretty hard to eff up those, just gotta make sure to request for them to be well done.

Its just a hobby, but we all know how hobbies can get out of hand. :joy::rofl: 

The fridge full of dough was for a pizza party but I did make way too much, the next day it doubled in size from that photo and was oozing out of the vegetable draw and containers. :scream:

Having extra dough around is not bad, you can make bagels, flatbreads etc. Or freeze it for later.

Pineapples actually grow out of the ground on relatively small plants (which surprised the hell out of me) and have no place on a pizza.

You know they don't call it that?  Canadian bacon is an American thing lol. It's just deli ham.

Try some back bacon.  Now that they actually eat and its damn good.

Oh it's this post. Dont know how it spun into a pizza thread. 

Pinapple jokes aside, Hawaiian pizza was my fav until I went to college and got quality pizza.

Deep Dish is the best. Creamy Artichoke pizza second. Then there's a variety of veggies pizza from Sliver and Cheeseboard (in Berkeley, CA) that I really like.
