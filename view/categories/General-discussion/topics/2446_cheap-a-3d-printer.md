Any recommendations for a Cheap ass 3D printer? I dont want to spend more than like 300 bucks lol  Not terribly concerned with print quality and accuracy.  Does anyone have any experience with cheap printers?

Don't buy cheap printers.. it's just like buying cheap e board parts, you will regret it later. And waste all of your money. If u get that one on kickstarter it may take a year to arrive, I am still waiting on mine from 7 months ago.. I recommend shop.prusa3d.com great customer support! I bought the kit and shipping was ~80usd.. it's a quality printer. And the support is worth more than u could imagine.. let me know if u have any more questions (sorry if the link didn't work, I'm on mobile)

No all in kit with detailed instructions. And if u have any questions u can live chat them.. make sure to get the 1.75mm version

http://shop.prusa3d.com/en/3d-printers/59-original-prusa-i3-kit-with-lcd.html

The prints are great and I am currently printing an envlclosure for my electronics.. the kit even comes with a huge roll of filament

Edit: the prints are great! I have a friend who has an $899 printer that only prints pla and mine is way way way better.. if u get it, when assembeling make sure EVERYTHING is square. It will save u time later

May be a good printer, a few things.. it has no heated bed, so u can't print with ABS plastic, which is essential for 3d printing eso8 parts (anything u will use outside).. 2.. don't expect the prints to look like the pictures, that is after at least 2hours by hand to do that.. 3. The price is a little to low, 3d printing technology Isint there yet to be that cheap 4.. beware of the assembly instruction, they may not be that good, and if it's ur first printer that may not work well.. If u decide to get it let me know how it is!

@chaka - saw your post in the mad monkey gt2b enclosure thread.  Looking at that printer (TEVO Tarantula I3).  Had a couple questions on it and figured you might respond here to help others out looking for a cheap 3d printer?

Can it print Nylon?  Any of the wood filaments?

How is it going - any issue setting up?  Software to run, or other problems?

Thx!!

I should have it on Monday. It takes about 8 days before it ships from the distributor in HK but it only takes a few days for delivery from there. I'll definitely let you know how it goes when it arrives.

Thx!  I have been on the fence for a while.  Thanks for your link!!  I pulled the trigger after seeing several really great reviews...  I'm going to go watch the setup videos next and check out their FB group.

Next i'm really curious what software to use...  I got the "upgraded" all metal "pro" extruder and hope it will work with Nylon well.

For the $ - it does way more (claimed) types of plastic/filament.  Higher strength ones like Nylon are really what i'm hoping for - enclosures and other misc parts - cannot wait!!!

That guy in that video I posted is what sold me. He explained my situation perfectly. If it works well I may build a couple of them.

You can upgrade these units infinity since they are built on slotted aluminum extrusion. New hot end, better extruder etc... I think my next unit will be a little more structurally robust so I can use a hotend/direct extruder, that seems to be the "best" setup right now. This little slimbot needs to use the bowden style extruder due to weight limitations on the z-axis.

Qidi
[/quote]

I was going to get the Qidi as well.  The deciding factor for me was the additional materials the Tarantula will do  (Qidi does ABS/PLA, Tarantula says it will do PLA, ABS,Flexible PLA, HIPS,WOOD,PVA, Nylon).

I splurged on the larger print model (200x280x200mm) and dual extruders (hopefully both are the all metal "pro" for flex PLA).

Stoked!  Thanks @Chaka!!

I went on the cheap, no extras. I wanted to do a little more research on possible upgrades first. Let me know how it works.

I have been ordering v-slot extrusion accessories from smw3d, if you need any extra hardware they should have what you need. http://www.smw3d.com/aluminum-extruded-v-slot-from-openbuilds/

Sounds good. For the Qidi if I want to print exotic materials all you need is a nozzle that can handle greater temp. However, I think the biggest upside to your choice is the larger print area. I'm hitting the limits of mine... good luck!

@sl33py

The tarantula is up and running! Its busy printing a few parts for itself at the moment. A cooling shroud, rigid z-axis motor mount and a few other items. It took about 6 hours to assemble and another 3 hours setting up a clean install of ubuntu, Slic3r and printrun. I am pretty busy this coming week but if you run int a wall let me know and I may be able to save you some time ;)

Super cool!  Mine is supposed to arrive Wed/Thu but doubt i'll be able to assemble it until i get back from a weekend trip.

Would love to hear how it goes and any issues?  I got the large dual, so i've been trying to read up a bunch and see what the process is.

Can't wait to print up some ABS and Nylon!  Just saw another cool filament - polymaker PC (polycarbonate).  So many cool options!  Between enclosures and wheel gears i think i'm going to be busy!

Will ping you for sure if i get stuck.    The hardware seems pretty straightforward - i'm most hesitant about which firmware, how to configure it for dual and large bed, and software to run it all...

@Chaka - what's the latest with your T1 (Tevo Tarantula)?  

I've got mine about half complete, and just taking a break for some extra parts to arrive Friday (also my day off) and finish it.  I figure it will be about 8 hours build time going slow and trying to get it 100% right.

Getting the frame perfectly square is a PITA right now.  i need to loosen - adjust - tighten it again after trying to move it and it moved a bit out of whack.  I've ordered some additional support "L"s to reinforce it, but need some more t nuts as well!  They send a few extra, but not quite enough.

I have bits and parts to enclose the power supply and give it a standard 3 prong C13 plug w/ on/off switch using this:
[img]http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61IvuGVmEJL._SX522_.jpg[/img]
Also waiting on the assortment of crimp connectors so i can connect all 3 voltage outputs.  Heard some scary stories from folks burning single contacts on their power supply as it tries to provide the full amperage through just one small connector so i'll be connecting all 3 to distribute the load.  Plus some upgraded heavier wire to carry it.  Only takes a few minutes to address some shortcomings of their kit.

I'm hoping to try some of the carbon PLA and the stronger materials besides ABS/PLA most can do.

What's your plans next Chaka?

If you want a cheap 3d printer,the monoprice maker selecy Is your best in the US option. Usually it can be had for 350 shipped. At this point 90% of all kickstarter 3d printers have failed to deliver. Serious, I can name 10 off the top of my head, don't kick start one. It's a terrible, terrible idea.

Hobbyking is charging 71 dollars shipping on that, which is a clone of a better printer (dont do clones in 3d printing, they really, really, suck.) Its cloning the wanhao duplicator i3, which is the same as the monoprice maker select.

If you REALLY want to stick to a tight budget on a 3d printer, and want something proven.Get a folgertech prusa i3, the aluminum one. It is a kit, so it has to be assembled but it can be done in a day if you are decent with tools.

https://folgertech.com/collections/3d-printer-full-kits/products/folger-tech-reprap-2020-prusa-i3-full-aluminum-3d-printer-kit
its 269.99 plus 25 dollar shipping so 295.00 shipped. 
Its not as pretty as other ones, but works very well. I have their kossel printer (but that takes a lot of tinkering to get right, I don't recommend unless you really want a challenge.)

IF you have a bigger budget, say 500, get their ft5 printer. Its brand new but has a huge print area, (12x12x~16inches. Its gigantic in 3d printer terms. most are 8x8x8)
https://folgertech.com/collections/3d-printer-full-kits/products/folger-tech-ft-5-large-scale-3d-printer-kit


But overall, I'd still recommend the monoprice maker select, they come on sale a lot, and you only have to do 2 bolts to get started on printing. Wanhao duplicator i3 is the same printer btw if you can catch one of those. Don't buy from wanhao usa though, they have been having issues as of late.

I'm going to print the stiffening brackets w/ the gift PLA.  Corner braces and bottom brackets for sure.  If i have Z banding i will start with the oldham coupler to help and go from there.  I'm going super slow on my build - re-doing the wiring on the power supply (pulling from all 3 + and - contacts), fused c13 power plug added into a job box, so all contacts/wires will be inside box (need to add an exhaust fan - just open currently).  

While i've been slacking on getting it running i've already done some upgrades:
I insulated my bed with some DEI high temp insulation i had from reflow oven project.  
Going to upgrade power wires from PSU to 10 or 12g (if you look at the thick insulation and thin wires inside of the supplied wires from China - yikes!).  
And thinking i will direct solder with some xt60 connectors for the power to MKS board and output to heated bed.  

I've seen quite a few "scorched" power connection examples for both i want to avoid.  I need to find my bigger solder wick...  

I have just been fiddling with this an hour or two an evening while watching TV.  No rush and want to make it work as best as possible.  Need to get it off the living room table soon though as GF wants to eat on it or something silly like that...  ;)

I'd say get one with the enclosure and a heated bed. Most people want to use ABS. I am using PETG which requires only a heated bed and a fan blowing on the print. I regret having bought a printer that has too small of a printing volume (250x150x150mm). If you're thinking of printing enclosures and the like, get something that can print larger stuff.

I use the tevo tarantula every day! It has a heated bed and can print just as well or better than some printers that cost 10 times as much. The caveat is the fact that you need to assemble it but it does have a huge user group on facebook so there are people who are willing to help and share their experience. 

They also have a larger model being released soon, I will probably get that model too since I find myself needing a second unit from time to time.

I have the tevo Tarantula as well.  It's great, but does need care and time spent building and getting it setup right.  The facebook group is awesome for help and advice. 

Mine looks very different due to the upgrades I've done so far.  More are planned and on their way.

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/a/ae14fd2b39318474fdbaf8dce3598acdf128a8d1.jpg" width="666" height="500">

I would recommend going for the standard model with the larger bed.  All the other choices are overpriced and the parts can be picked up cheaper yourself at a later date.  I got the auto leveling model and gave up on it as it's hard to get setup right.  Manual levelling is so much easier and quicker.  I would also recommend getting a piece of borosilicate glass for the bed.  It will make things a lot easier to get level and adhering.

I have printed in PLA, ABS and lately PETG. PETG to me is the best of both worlds. The issue with ABS is that it curls, so you need to be careful. PETG has no shrinkage, but it has some stringing that you need to look out for and tune the temperatures. Also, you will need a fan to blow on your print, it's critical otherwise it will just not work well.

Thanks,  it's still a work in progress.  I'm designing a cover for the psu and some way of mounting that to the rear of the printer.  That will clear up much cabling.  Then I'm mid way through redesigning the controller board box so that the cables from that are less of a nightmare.

No, I designed it myself and got the extra extrusions cut to size on Ali Express.  I did it as I'm going for a dual Z setup so I needed better support for the top section.  It allows me also to mount a lot more kit without risking putting everything out of alignment.  You will need lots of extra angle brackets as well as t-nuts/bolts to put it all together.

I've just ordered some carbon fibre bits from http://www.mackers.it/ today as well to make things even more rigid.

Is that carbon kit $120USD? or EUR

Is the dual z to improve accuracy or are you expanding your print space?

Are there any mods that increase the stability of the print bed, Ive noticed the bed can rock cause the screw and springs only provide tension on the z axis and no stability for x and y

Its in $, well it was for me in the UK.  I'm using the dual Z to stop the slop on the left hand side of the z and it will improve all over z accuracy.  I'm not worrying about print space as I've not got plans to print massive things anyway.

I'm going for mgn12h rails which improve the bed stability.  With the carbon bits and those I will have made it better.  Making the bed really low will reduce the spring issue too.

I've done a few upgrades on my Tevo Tarantula over the last few weeks.  All the acrylic pieces are now in carbon fibre.  Total overkill, but awesome.  I also upgraded to linear rails and some new mounting points for the mks board.  I've added a raspberry pi as well so that I can print using Octopi which makes printing much easier.

It's printing really well, it's about as good as this kind of printer can get now without chucking a lot more money at it.

Hey guys love the thread and some great info on here! I just purchased my first 3D Printer off GearBesr for a black Friday sale for just $177 total ($23 shipping). It's the A8 Desktop 3D Printer Prusa i3 DIY Kit and it has some great reviews on there as well as on YouTube. It also has a pretty big printing area of 220 x 220 x 240mm which I'm really looking forward to. I've had some experience with 3D printers in the past using mainly a Lulz Bot Mini at our Library but I've always wanted one myself and I'm so happy to have finally got one! Once I've received and tested it I'll update this with how I think it is.

Back at it again with another new deal from GearBest, Anet just released there new E10 printer and its on sale for $290 for the next couple days. Its pretty much a CR-10 knockoff, excpet its a bit smaller at 220x270x300 instead of the 300x300x400 of the CR-10, but its $100 cheaper. Coupon code ANETE10 takes $10 off the 299 sale so its $290 with that. [LINK](http://www.gearbest.com/3d-printers-3d-printer-kits/pp_664899.html?wid=21)

My vote is the MPCNC. https://www.vicious1.com/

A lot to read about it, it is a cnc machine that can be a router and a printer with some geometry changes. The fact you can switch between the two makes it a very attractive option. You can print and then later do something more difficult like milling aluminum

Personally have a prusa i3 (original) DIY kit based one was $330 at the time (couple years ago).  You can get cheaper versions of that one now that are no doubt a bit better too and mine worked amazingly well considering I put it together and had no experience with the machines before that.  Have definitely learned a lot since then about them and upgraded to an all metal hot end to print with some stronger materials but I still give the machine a big :thumbsup:

There's now the Prusa i3 MK2 which offers auto bed leveling and can support multiple extruders but if you get prebuilt with all the bells and whistles it drives the price up.

Regarding the mixed machines it seems like an okay idea if implemented well (have seen some with just a swappable head and very little work to switch back and forth).  Main issue I see aside from wanting that to be easy is the amount of dust and garbage the milling process will make without some dust removal setup will be a big mess and the dust messes up prints if it gets on the filament and builds up in the nozzle as the plastic is extruded.  Good to be able to make the machine more multi-purpose but just not sure that would really work great in practice.
