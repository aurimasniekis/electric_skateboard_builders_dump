this thread could later be called "why I lost power and now have injuries".   I'm covered in wounds and broken body parts from bad connections coming loose at inopportune times.

its either the battery wires coming loose or the receiver wires or the can bus connection.  at worst I've had ghost accelerating from the receiver wires, or losing one motor's power with the can bus, or just losing brakes with the main battery wires disconnecting.   and that was my biggest injury as it happened going down a steep hill and I had to abandon ship.
