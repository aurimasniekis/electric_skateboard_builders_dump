Building my first board this summer, I've already done a lot of research on what I need to get. Here's the list I've thrown together. Any advice on possible things I've missed, or something that doesn't seem right to you would be highly appreciated. Also things like better choices for mounts/motors/batteries would be great too.

I figured I would need to make my board pretty beefy as I am a heavier guy (6'2" 235lbs) and I want a lot of range so I want a mAh in the 10,000 range.

Board:
	$60 Otang Kegels Wheels

diy-electric-skateboard-kits-parts/vesc-the-best-electric-skateboard-esc/
	$35 DIY's Battery Enclosure
	
Batteries
	12S(originally wanted a 12S setup and then I learned that it wasn't really recommended.)
	$144 2x Multistar 6S 16000mAh in series	 
		https://hobbyking.com/en_us/multistar-high-capacity-6s-16000mah-multi-rotor-lipo-pack.html
	or
	$180 4x Turnigy 6S 5000mAh, in parallel and series to achieve 12S 10000mAh 
		https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-5000mah-6s-20c-lipo-pack-1.html

10S(what I plan on getting)
$120 4x Turnigy 5S 5000mAh, in parallel and series to achieve 10S 10000mAh

Looks pretty good, only other thing you'll need is an anti spark switch and a lipo charger. 

I recommend getting the wheels, trucks, and bearing off of Amazon, you will save about $20 total (and free shipping!)

I'd look at a 10s battery, it's a lot safer for the VESC and an easier learning curve.

The Sector9 Faultline  looks like a drop deck. Those can be difficult to get proper motor/deck clearance unless your planning to rear mount the motor

It's a top mount

Yes, its a top mount drop deck.
Difference between a drop through mount and a drop deck.
It's harder to get motor clearance on a drop deck
unless you use hub motors or rear mount your motors

Sorry, got them confused, just worked 10 hours, but still.

I wouldn't consider this a drop of any kind.

Maybe not a huge drop but there is a drop. I can see it in the pic and the website description says it's a drop deck.
Just trying to give you a heads up so you don't run into problems later.
