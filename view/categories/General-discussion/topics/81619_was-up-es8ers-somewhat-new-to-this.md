Was up community, I've been riding an EMBoard out here in the desert for awhile. I'm planning a from the ground up build but I gotta save up for what I want. My streets suck here in SoCal at least in the HD. If anyone is here from the High Desert in Cali hmu I need some people to ride with. But if anyone has experience building a board for the desert lmk. Thanks Esk8 community for letting me be apart of it all  ‚úåÔ∏è

Not really sure what your question is.
I guess a good tip would be to get some off road wheels and extra dust protection like neoprene.

But welcome

Not much of a question. I guess just if you have built a mountain board or something to the extent. But mostly my post is about hopefully finding some people near me to ride with. Obviously off road tires. I can't find any good inhub motors for off road actually so if you know where that would helpful

Makes sense. So I guess I'll have to design my own

Look a bit around here. 
Some guys here made some hub or direct drive for e mtbs. 
I can‚Äôt say if they really perform well but as min they can give you some inspiration, maybe üòÖ

Why you want to go with a hub solution and not regular with normal outrunner and belt/chain or gear drive?

I just like as little parts showing as possible. I want it to be very stealthy looking. I also like the idea of hub motors. I have a design for direct drive that acts like an inhub.

It's not that hub motors for off-road wheels don't exist it's just that most arent very good quality. Idk about the quality of those hub motors they look a lot like the ones on the backfire ranger

Just saying this, you won't be getting quality hub motors from China any time soon

if you decide on in hub and off-road wheels you will either have to wait for torque board pneumatics and get one if his direct drives or make your own (which will be difficult probably expensive and has a higher chance of breaking

Yeah I know money is always an issue until it isn't. but  no matter I have some assests I can sell and if I can design my own mount on and a few other things, I can have a nice American made kit. Maybe i can possibly sell and make that money back since my manufacturer won't do less than a 1000 units. I have a guy who does property blue prints and he agreed to help me design my own kit but time and money is all I need. It's just out here in the desert the terrain is very rough and random. I need something that can transition between it well. I really don't like the look of belt drive boards. RT now I have a 4x4 Revel on a custom cut magneto downhill with oversized street tires. the company got a lot better now that they aren't landwheel anymore. I prefer their romote over any I've seen so far also
