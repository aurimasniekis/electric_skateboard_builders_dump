SAMPLE/TESTER BUY

With the Colorado event around the corner and new products being released from Maytech we would like to try and get as many units out in the hands of the intended market for real hands-on testing.
Maytech is not a new company and has many products on the market used widely today in our builds. From remotes to controllers to motors Maytech has done it all. So we are not as apprehensive of their new products as most new companies bringing things to the market. 
Quality has always been a necessity of ours along with affordability.
 
With all that said, We would like to invite the esk8 community to take part in what we think is the best way to get real (NEW) product reviews.

SAMPLE/TESTER BUYS

Basically, Maytech offers us a discount on new products at small order numbers. We see an opportunity to help get the products in the hands of the intended, instead of a quick profit. 
What we can do is pass this savings on to the buyer with the intent on offering his or her opinion on the quality, durability, and reliability of the product. The buyer gets a remote, esc, or motor at slightly above cost price and we get real feedback that isn't tainted by possible lost sales.
  The community, Hyper ion, and Maytech all benefits from this.
the individuals who participate get a product at a well below retail price,
we get a real indication of product performance and demand in the future, Maytech sells products and has a real source of information on their products in real application use, not just the bench.

alright I think I've got the budget to add that onto my first build. I'm up for added fail safes
Just to get abit of clarification since these aren't officially released yet, The Dyno break is placed in line between the motors and the vesc? would you need one dyno break per motor/vesc?

Excellent Question, being that there are only two leads  (+/-) coming from the unit it would suggest it's between battery and ESC, for it to go on phase it should be 3. I have sent an email requesting  installation instructions, i should have an answer shortly

 By dynobrake you mean the rheostatic brake? Well it will be connected to the input of the ESC. 

It just senses when the voltage there is higher than the battery Max voltage and then activates the brake.

that was my understanding as well, but meant to bleed power off during hard braking, not to engage the brake. Maytech is great at making things and bad at offering information.
I will have some clear info shortly

```
The Rheostatic brake is connected to the battery in parallel (red cable to BATT+, black cable to BATT-).
It doesn't need to adjust parameters. Its operation voltage is set to 57V, which is designed for VESC controllers.
So, when braking and the motors are generating power that is being feedback through the esc to the battery (that can cause spikes in volts and amps in the battery) that is then pushed back to the esc because the battery is full and trip set limits or cause damage to the esc. 
because its preset limit is 57v it is meant to protect the esc  and don't
need to be adjusted according to your battery or if your duel/single.

So it’s basically a break resistor?
We use something the sand on our trains.
If we break regenerative but can’t charge back to the network, we just fire up the energy via a break resistor.

excellent question, so good I had to ask Benjamin.
As he explained it, it works on its preset 57v limit as part of the system.
If you think in terms of the whole system and  not just one components function.  
Battery, BMS, RB module, ESC and motors.

Over the last 18 months, we have seen an increase in power handling.
At one time escs were limited to 30a, not anymore. Direct discharge (bigger batteries) came about because of this change in ability.
the advancement of the regulatory capabilities of the esc improved greatly. Removing further the need for discharge BMS units. Direct discharge BMS bypass usage changed the equation of in/out and regenerated power.
More efficient and powerful motors can push a lot of power back through the esc and into the battery. Keeping in mind its a part of a system, you see that it works both ways. With a preset 57v which is below the limits of the esc and slightly above the limits of the biggest battery 13s or 54v.
Batteries will have a big impact on this system simply because of the different types of cell amp and volt that can be used in series and parallel.
In any system of this type spikes in amps and volts are common in high volt/amp situations. High drain to hard braking, this is where the RB module comes into effect preventing spikes over 57v from damaging the ESC or the battery. The battery has an overcharge system already that will engage and start to bleed excess power off(even a direct discharge setup) balance/overcharge protection along with the ESC volt cut offs soft/hard for discharge protection. 
Now depending on your battery and its capability and your motors and its capability will determine to what extent the module functions.
The 10s battery on low kV motors may only benefit from the regin protection it provides the esc, to where the more high powered batteries and motors with high kV would benefit both.  
With a growing number of batteries direct discharge, the ability to regulate power out is disabled.  
I hope that makes sense, keep in mind that our application and its intended application are not always the same. As the technology grows in power and the DIY community continue to push the boundaries so will the products driving it.
As stated in the TOPIC these products are new and will be tested and tweaked from the response the community gives.

quick update on some of the functions on the remote.
waterproof remote can show 3-14s battery voltage if connect the receiver to BATT+.

The customer can adjust "2. Batt" (3.2V/S or 3.7V/S) and "3. Batt. Num" (1-14s) according to their battery. 

And because the battery voltage indicator has 10% tolerance. So it's better to set batt number 1S less than actual battery S.  (For example, if your battery is 3.7V, 6S, it's better to set remote Batt.Num to 5.)

Update on the R Brake, after some testing of the unit the initial performance of the unit is impressive. During testing on a few different battery sizes, we discovered an issue in the firmware. I believe the question was brought up if the unit needed to be set to certain battery size, well the answer is yes. We have confirmed this with the engineer at maytech and the units will be set up for 12s or 10s use. If you ordered or received an R BRAKE  unit from us please use it on a 10s setup and no higher. they will produce a version for the 12s and slightly alter the firmware for the 10s.

Hey Guys, 
  Just wanted to update everyone in general and I will follow up with those that need tracking, if you paid an invoice through PayPal your tracking will be attached to the invoice details, please check there. 
The remotes came in yesterday and 2 were damaged from shipping. 
(2) customers will have to wait a few weeks for the remote (Maytech return from holiday) Being the last two to order the wait won't be that long. I will contact these individuals directly. We also had 4 damaged 2 6880 and 2 6374 sealed motors and 4 were not ready to ship 6374 unsealed ( still in production )
The USA GB 6880 motors have shipped out, I will send tracking to those guys. 
We have about 8 of the MT6.6 SESC 200A available at the GB price of $165 after they are gone the price will be close to $200 each.
The remotes are on the way to those who ordered one, and any further orders for those will be $180 for remote with charge pad and $160 without. 
We will have 12s brakes in a month or so if you got one please use on a 10s setup, I will send those who wanted it for 12s a replacement when available. 
We have been testing the MT switch and so far it's holding up. @mixedcreation, @Holyman92, @Skunk, @Sender, and a few others I have included a switch for you to try in your orders.

I think it is pretty good, granted it has been like 0-30 degrees for the past month in a half..soo not much riding.  

But the little time I had to ride with it wasn't causing any issues.  I guess I kinda like the push to start, but I am not sure if I am sold on it because I physically like to see a button to push on and off.  Call me crazy.  Although, I am going to move this over to a small commuter board I am finishing.  I will have more data on this since I am going to let my buddies son in college ride it around campus to class.  He will give a good feedback during this time of year since he goes to school at UNC.  

But I should have a good review this weekend after we come out of -11 degrees today to 50-60 degrees in 2 days.  Fucking Polar Vortex

I kinda figured you were berried for a while. the push to start is great for 10s, I sent you a 12s switch (maytech) and one of the new Rbrakes, you can use it on 10s setups. they will have to make one for 12s because of batteries now achieve a full charge.

Holy sheep shit... SWEET!  I will open up my big green monster and see what she can do!  Sadly it is the only board I want to ride now.  The power is just addicting!  

Looks like I have some tinkering to do this weekend.

save the Rbrake for 10s, I tested the units they sent. they are set to close to a full charge of the battery in a 12s setup. It wants to engage and bleed off power if connected to a fully charged battery.
They will be adapting the firmware to accommodate 12s in a month or so

Woohoo, that the R brake is for 10S. Now, I won't have failed brakes on full charge.
Nice little aluminum box. 70mmX46mmX18mm. Wires are 20AWG. I wonder what current can the circuit handle.

It should... Your unity should have come with an adapter for your controller 👍
