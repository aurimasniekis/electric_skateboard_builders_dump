Guys! 
I really need your help! I'm from Hawaii been looking for vendors that will ship lithium battery pack to Hawaii. Emailed several of them and their reply "can't ship lithium battery pack to Hawaii" what gives? If there are any Hawaii eboarder? Chip in. Need your expertise acquiring lithium battery 36v 10ah or lower. Pardon my grammar second language. Thanks!

It's nearly impossible to ship a completed pack unless sections are under 100 WHr. Beside that, there has to be at least one person on the island with access to a battery spot welder.

There was a guy from Hawaii who got a kaly nyc board.
So there need to be a way to ship batteries.
Maybe @Kaly can say you how he shipped his boards there

Well I think some people ship stuff using normal companies without even telling its batteries inside.

But that is **ck move as you endangering them with dangerious goods.

Batteries can only be shipped by regular mail if part of a finish product and is located inside the product. 

For stand alone product you need to comply with regulations of hazardous materials and use the appropriate shipping service with is accompanied fee. 
For IATA regulations go to this link 

https://www.iata.org/publications/dgr/Pages/index.aspx

And guys please donâ€™t speculate on how people ship stuff, gossip never helped anyone. 

it is better to just ask your vendor and have that info on your invoice in case the goods get confiscated, this way you wonâ€™t loose your money.

Oahu_greg, Hey bud I emailed them and called and left a message,  waiting to hear back now, Iâ€™m trying to buy a assembled eboard from 
diyeboards.com. It would have the 10s5p battery installed. You think theyâ€™re gonna be able to forward that to me in Oahu?
