I'm looking into selling away my boards to finance one. I'd have to pay $330 shipping to the UK, so considering this, is it actually economical to buy one? 

In my situation, I would potentially be able to make my own motor mounts/3d print components, but I can't make my own battery and I like what Lacroix has going. I'm wondering if its actually economical to buy one, or if its marginally cheaper to make my own board. I am using a landyachtz evo w/ diyeboard components on it at the moment, I really like the airless tires and stuff so I don't know how much of a step up pneumatic are from the airless tires.

What about import taxes?
This can make a big difference in your final decision.

depends on your tax limit in your country.
Where I live it¬¥s 1000$ per month.
If you come over it, you need to pay the tax.

Are they selling a kit including board+enclosure+battery pack? On the website I can only see the complete and the board+enclosure. 

Either way, economical is not the reason I would choose that set up if I had the $$$. That‚Äôs already 700$ for board+enclosure, don‚Äôt get me wrong, I love it but  I just cannot conceive how I would spend that much for a deck. The introduction price was somewhat more acceptable but they probably won‚Äôt do it again.

No idea. This is country specific.
In Greece anything above 22Euro pays VAT and over 150Euro VAT + import tax. These prices include shipping costs, so if an item is 130 actual cost+40 shipping then importing it costs 170Euro +24%VAT + import taxes
If you use a courier service (UPS, FEDEX etc) then you will also be charged brokerage fees (which are usually very expensive)
Some parcels may slip through customs if the vendor declares a lower value on the parcel but nowadays if it is comes outside of the EU and is above 150Euro you are screwed.

I don't think income has anything to do with import taxes at least in the UK

its not about how much you earn.
It¬¥s about the value of your ordered product.
our tax limit is 1000$ in the month.
means, if I order a board for 1300$ i need to pay 30% tax for 300$ which exceeded the 1000$ mark.

You could get one built locally
330$+import will cost almost as a regular single build

So you can import 1000$ worth of crap from china?

yap! not only form china ;)
if everything comes in one month 1000$ can be reached fast :sweat_smile:
As far as I know from next year it will be set down to 500$, but even than.
Still can order 500 for me and 500 for my girfriend :joy:
that safes a lot of money, which I usually need to spend for the shipping than anyhow...

We're in the commonwealth and I can't even think about a lacroix because of silly import duties.  Has to do with trade agreements and apparently Canada has bad ones with certain members of the commonwealth. Why is above my pay grade and I don't care enough to bother finding out but its annoying hey?  To have a complete lacroix delivered to aus costs in total $4000 us
Bollocks I say.

3100‚Ç¨ is a lot for a board.
Just as a quick exercise:
Landyachtz EVO 200‚Ç¨
6374 motors 300‚Ç¨
Focboxes 300‚Ç¨
Surfrodz + mounts 300‚Ç¨
Sixshooters 300‚Ç¨
Remote 50‚Ç¨
Enclosure 100‚Ç¨
12S5P 30Q Battery with BMS 500‚Ç¨
Various stuff I forget 200‚Ç¨
Total 2250‚Ç¨ for a top of the line esk8.

I was able to see one in action at an esk8 group ride. It was one of the dopest boards, always in front, and looks amazing. 

Maybe Canada can be great again and strike a new deal with Brexit to allow for Better trade üòä

I bought a LaCroix and YES its expensive, even if I when pick it up my self (they live almost next door). 

But remember that you‚Äôre buying the "Ferrari" of the e-board. Smooth riding, great carving, impressive autonomy and crazy wheel power. Its look good, it is well builds with top of the ling parts, and customer after market service is excellent. 

I could have built my own but all the trial and error would probably have me spend a lot of waist money. 

No regret.

Right but imagine building your own and wasting 500$, you still wouldn't be close to what I have to pay. And 500$ is a hell of a lot. 

I am probably going to DIY. Already tracked down a battery, board and enclosure I like and it looks like the entire build will come to like 1500$.

Of course, the pride and knowledge earn by building its own board is priceless. If you already have the tools, the basic knowledge and time, go for it! You will make something that really sits your needs.

If it‚Äôs a cordless drill it‚Äôs a great start, you have battery and a motor. 

I build my own e-chopper. 
What did  I learn: 
-its cost more than I though, 
-it takes more time than I though, 
-I strip and rebuild so many time that I can now do it with my eyes close. 


No regret but for the e-skate, I decide to work, save money  and buy one. 

go with your gut.
