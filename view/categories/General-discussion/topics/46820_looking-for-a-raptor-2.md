Hey Good people,
I’m looking to find a Raptor 2 in Southern California. I currently have hardly used Evolve Bamboo GT that includes 83mm, 97mm Abec Flywheels and All terrian Wheels that I’m looking to trade. I purchased directly from Evolve USA.

Anyone keen for a trade?

Seems like a shitty trade. The R2 kills the Evolve in every way. Good luck though dude.
