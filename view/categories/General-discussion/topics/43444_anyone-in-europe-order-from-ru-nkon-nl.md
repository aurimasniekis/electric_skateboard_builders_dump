You can't even ship to the EU from the ru site.  Nkon is in the Netherlands. The ru site is for non-EU customers

Doesn't it add VAT when you checkout so the price willl be the same as ordering on nkon.nl?

Try to checkout. It's not going to let you select a European country when you try to calculate shipping.  Or else everyone in the EU would just use the ru site....

Maybe use a VPN to bypass it Then Buy it and they see European address And they will be forced to pull through and say it was glitch?

Add any batteries to cart write Russia, everywhere after you clicked what shipping method to use,

On the right Side you can see Billing address shipping address,

So side click on Russia Click inspect Change that to your country and Click pay with PayPal,

Worse case Paypal will force a refund,

Click inspect  Change that to your country

PSA:
Hacking the site to make it work may not be legal in your jurisdiction.  Please consult a lawyer before you do that.

Also, if they only have validations on the end-user side and not on the server-side then they're surely already hacked and you shouldn't give them payment information anyway.

As I have said 

[quote="Blitz, post:15, topic:43444"]
Were Just speculating

And I meant that,.. Because that would be theft, Who cares if its legal or not,
My point was contact them Via Email and Arrange something.
