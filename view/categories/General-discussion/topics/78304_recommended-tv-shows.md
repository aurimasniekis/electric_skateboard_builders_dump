I used to have a photo with me and the cast of Adventuretime. I was looking for it to make you jealous but couldn't find it. Got to hang out with the little boy who plays fin for a couple hours in downtown SD. He's a cool cat

No photo needed, already jealous. I love that time passes in that cartoon unlike most. The kid going through puberty reflects perfectly on the character. Plus bender as a magic dog is phenomenal. Fun fact, in the pilot episode, the main character is actually voiced by Jeremy Shadas older brother but he was already mid puberty when the show got picked up so they used the younger brother instead.

No joke I've met Dave no less that 50 times. He lives about 30 minutes away in a hippy town called yellow springs. Super real dude. Unbelievably down to earth. Bumped into him while he was skating once and burned a j with him. Only celebrity encounter I've had.
