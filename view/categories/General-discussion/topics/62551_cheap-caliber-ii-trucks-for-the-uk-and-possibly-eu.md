Hi all,

Just thought I'd share some info for UK people (and possibly Europe) to buy Caliber II trucks fairly cheap compared to buying them in the UK. The going rate for these trucks appears to be around £60 - £70 for a pair in the UK.

As I'm always on the lookout for a bargain, you can actually buy these from Amazon US for £44.37 delivered including import fees/taxes.

Link here: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00NY3Q5Q8/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&th=1&psc=1

Just checkout and it'll add international shipping / import fees. It also allows you to pay in £GBP to avoid any international credit card/debit card fees from your bank. As above the total price will be roughly £44.37 delivered (might alter slightly depending on exchange rate at the time).

It's for the more popular 50 degree 10" versions and you can select any colour. Mine took around 15 days to be delivered and they're genuine Caliber trucks.

Though I'd share as it might be useful for someone else?
