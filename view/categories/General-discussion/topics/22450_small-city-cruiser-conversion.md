Hey guys,

I got hooked (thanks Jason for the 450$ video). I probably spent double but it was worth every penny.

My board is 81cm cruiser with a single drive 245kv,6s 5000mah lipo, enertion vesc,15/35 and I need more torque and distance. Speed is not all that important, but I also dont wanna look like a complete dweeb. So max 25kmh is fine.

I wanna get a jet spud 29 and up the game with freebord bindings.

I was thinking of doing a 9s with BMS and a new motor. I guess 12s is not an option with vesc?
I need your suggestion on which motor -maybe sk3 168 or 192kv? And where do i get a good 9s bms?
Im based in EU, so i guess thats also a factor.. Many thx

IMO the VESC is much weaker on 6s compared to Car ESC's. I had a Tacon 295kv setup on 6s with an FVT ESC and would get about 24mph on it. Switch to VESC to test and would get 15-17mph. May be a setting but I just switched back and didn't mess with it.

Jet Spuds are impossible to get your hands on.

Im defs gonna try that out at some point. Btw, do you think this is a good parallel board for 3 5000mah zippys 3s?
