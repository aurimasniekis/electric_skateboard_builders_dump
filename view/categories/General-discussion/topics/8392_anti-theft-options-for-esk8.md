Hello fellow users !

I am creating this topic as a place for you to share what devices you use in order to protect your beloved board from being stolen or lost.
Do you know some GPS trackers, "board" lockers or some other things useful to protect your 4-wheeled friend ?

I hope this could benefit other e-skaters willing to protect their board, have a nice day !

I guess TILE would be an option.

It would be hilarious if their thief came on here asking for help on how to get it working and binding with a new remote.

I'm thinking of adding a GPS tracker meant for bikes because the price of a good eboard is so expensive

Well let's say soemone grabs it, shots you in the feet and jumps into a car. How to get you board back ? xD


I saw Tile and TrackR but I find them limited

I would like to have a way to stop my board via my mobile phone so if I let a stranger use it I can be sure he doesn't rides away with it. Otherwise a GPS device would be cool or I'll even use an alarm device that will let the alarm ring if the charger is unplugged without disarming the alarm first (like flipping a switch or something) , so I can go to the toilet and leave my board charging when I'm in a cafe/Starbucks lol.

well if I have been shot in the feet, I'm probably not going to want to skate any more so they can have it.

but if you want to track it just put a GPS dot on it.

I ordered up some of the TrackR's to place inside the board.  Figure better than nothing (having had one stolen already because i'm an idiot and left it in the car).  Best protection is to keep it with you...

Note on the TrackR vs Tile - TrackR has a replaceable battery - Tile you have to exchange.  It was the deciding factor for me, and the two way vs one way for keys/phone.

there are options which are very cheap as in the following:

they work well and are very easy to setup....

sadly they do not have a kill switch ....:( that would be great to have....the ones which do have one  are much more expensive...

Maybe.  Don't worry it's a distinctive board, and if i see it i'll get it back.  Plus a permanent limp for the thief.  I still look on local CL and keep an eye out.  Sucky lesson to learn, but leaving it in the car at work was dumb.  Window cracked and probably a clothes hanger or easier to break in.  Old car, so not much challenge.  Just because it's a locked garage... I still should've taken it into work.

There was a similar thread to this one.. I think one of the solutions was to install motion alarm.. once board has been moved or a vibration is sensed.. a loud noise / alarm is triggered.. 

was not that expensive..  although this one relies on response time and surrounding people alertness level / response to action.

@lowGuido method is the best, but sometimes you may leave it beside you and not be watching it and someone could take it I suppose. Never thought it would be an issue. Most ppl wouldnt even know what it is.

However now that it brought up I like the idea of the tracker and combo with a motion detector. As long as you could set the detector properly. Wouldnt want it gong off all the time every time I used it. Have a Raptor so big investment and doubt Id be able to afford another one if it was stolen.

If it was stolen from car you may be covered unde insurance for sone personal items takwn if the policy details that.

Someone should make a bag that your board goes into and then the bag locks on to a bike rack. I would buy that in a heart beat. 

There are bag materials that are resistant to cutting, and tearing.

By the way - **The previous anti-theft topic** is here:

http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/how-to-secure-lock-up-your-board-for-safe-storage-in-public-areas

----
I proposed an idea there for boards with ''grip handles'' to put a chainlock through the hole / holes to secure the board in place, similar like bicycles are locked to objects.

----
As for **securing the components**:

One solution would be:

* Closed bag

** It could partly solve the problem (gives no idea what is inside / extra layer of protection for not accessing the board directly) 
** Minus - needs to be carried in backpack or something similar.

Id be interested to know how many owners have actually had their boards stolen. Dont think its that big an issue. Its not like they are really going to go very far without you knowing about it. Youll have the remote, so its going to have to be carried which is awkward to run with or skate off which isnt that easy if its pullied.

I have 5 trackrs I have only gotten 2 of them to work for about a week. All of them are dead now and I even replaced the batteries! 

Does anyone actually have these and have them work?

I was complaining about this to my friend at work and he was like "Oh I just just tile for my laptop bag. It works great!".
I told him to look on his app and see if its still working. 
It said his bag was still at home!

I don't trust these things.

I say bag for a couple reasons

1) people can't see that what is in the bag is a valuable electric skateboard 
2) a bag offfers better protection as individual components cannot be removed
3) offers weather protection
4) compatible with any size board/no custom mods required 

Someone go make this

Honestly, it's bluetooth, so you only get connection if you're close. If you ACTUALLY lose it or get mugged you're kinda f#@ked. You can report it as lost and you'll get a location update if somebody with the app goes anywhere near it. I find it nice if I misplace my keys or wallet somewhere.

ITraq-- but it wasn't available to purchase when I heard of it, and didn't get any startup funding. Also sounds as if it wasn't very accurate. Sometimes off by a couple blocks. And the location only updates every 10 minutes. Doesn't sound that good. I'm sure there are other, more reliable options.

I know the TrackR uses Crowd GPS - and think the Tile does as well.  Anyone w/ the app near it will show it on the map.  So while not true GPS reporting back by cellular, the other users do "ping" when it's nearby and helps return a location dot.  At least a general area and potentially lets you get enough detail to go near it and set off the little buzzer alarm!

Since i haven't received it yet here's their promo video showing this:
https://youtu.be/LIMe8cvidGg

No affiliation, not trying to spam, but it does seem like an ideal way to find a "mispalced" esk8 if hidden and folks don't know to remove it.

I think I've seen at least 3 members on this forum who have said their eboards got stolen.. One was even from a car.. (he did not hide the board in car, so it could be seen, I think).

So yeah.. you can't really know when it might happen.. so to consider extra measures how to protect the board if you have to leave it somewhere would be a nice idea, I think. Especially, if it is a mountainboard .. :D

I think an alarm would be good as it would deter soneone trying to run off with it if it pumped out 120 db and would probably be easy to add to eboard. Saw trakr vid and that seemed to work as well if it does ge lost/stolen.

I watched that trackR vid also but was concerned that they only ping when in range of another trackR user. So for me in the UK where there are hardly any (I dont think) it's not much use as the probability of someone "A" stealing it & "B" passing another trackR user is minuscule. I like the alarm for the reason you state, just need to find a decent live app enabled GPS tracker (that will fit in the Raptor).

I'm reviving this thread because not too long ago i had a package lost by a carrier and in a lot of situations there's nothing they can do. Theft happens too, and sometimes, theft can even happen from a carrier. 

so found this:
https://www.brickhousesecurity.com/gps-trackers/spark-nano/

the footprint is right for the inside of my box as is, but it could easily be dissassembled, wired into a larger pack, and more tightly integrated. 

My plan is to integrate this into my builds. Not the packaging, but the board itself using a seperate power source, maybe a larger prismatic than what it comes with or possibly just a pair of 30Qs, and only pay for a month of tracking service. That will more than cover the trip from me to the customer, and give time for continued service for recovery if it tries to wander off into Lostville or Stolentown. 

Now i just ned to order a bat and put some nails in it for use during the recovery process.

@Longhairedboy Ohh....

![image|690x363](upload://tQefe45qFObBnpQbG5PG1E4KzcH.png) 

I asked from Telia, a quite leading Nordic-Baltic telecom provider about a 2G/3G card with 100Mb data plan and they replied it's about 2€ a month. The problem with Aliexpress trackers is that they don't have reliable service, so best would to just buy old phone and use it's "~find me" function, I think..

E: Actually I had link saved they do have M2M and IOT packets for things like automation processes and security things on it's own with lot's of specific features, you should have something like this too
