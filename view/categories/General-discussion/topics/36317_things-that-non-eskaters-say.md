Or when I'm on the Carbon GT and people be like (when it's upside down in a shopping cart, especially, "How long did it take you to make that?"  
  
Like freaking please if I could handmake a carbon fiber board and make it look like this shiaaaat.  I just lie and I'm like "a few weeks" because if I say I didn't make it, I know what they're going to say next - "How much did it cost?" and I really hate that question

in order of frequency

1. how fast does it go?
2. how long does the charge last?
3. how much is it?
4. where'd you get it?
5. you built it?
6. is it your job?
7. you should patent it

less frequently asked

1. how long did it take you?
2. did you put those lights on?
3. will you build me one?
4. how much you want for it?

I like it though when people are interested and love sharing

@b264 That's not true. It has a motor therefore it's motorized. FACT

You're correct, that is a fact.  However around here when anyone hears the word "motorized" they picture a stinky loud chainsaw petrol engine on it.  And that's totally not what it is.  So lying actually clears it up.

Kind-like when folks say they are "taping" something.  They are not using magnetic tape, they are recording

Cool idea actually.. i was sometimes thinking how to make the board remotely steerable, if such config was made.possible your esk8 could be a luggage carrier! 

What i mean is - there would be.no need to hold the board while walking, u could use it just by controlling the remote..

Ive been doing this a few times, where i steer my board with hands while also applying throttle.

haha, I love the "you're cheating" response. 

I built this board, many of the parts we're my design and I put it together. Is it really a matter of cheating? Or allocation of effort.  We allocate the effort before we ride so riding is effortless, manual skateboards need the effort to push them selves.

Those are my thoughts on it lol

Typical man on the street conversations usually go as follows:


"is that one of those boosted boards?" 
"no, its custom. I build them. You interested?"
"Oh i'd probably die on that thing man."
"Yeah its not for everyone."


"whaaaaat?"
"I build them"
"Whaaaaat?!"


"man where'd you get that shit?"
"I build them. Lot more fun than a car."
"How fast you go?"
"However fast i want. I can keep up with traffic in most places."
"The fuck you say..."


"YOU BUILT THAT??!?! How much?"
"About as much as a used car on the street, around $2.5k but it depends on what you want exactly. I make them custom."
"As much as a damn car... shiiiiiiit."


" I want one of those for my kid. What is that, $500 or $600 something like that??" 
"Base models start at $2370."
"WHAT? Shiiiiiit."


"Oh Damn! Can I ride it?"
"No, not now, but here's my card. Look me up and we can arrange a test ride if you want to come out to the shop."


"THOSE AREN'T ALLOWED ON THE TRAIL!! ANYWHERE OMN THE TRAIL!!"
"IF YOU CAN CATCH ME IN THAT FUCKING PARK SERVICE GOLF CART I'LL START WALKING ASSHOLE!"


"Can i take a picture with it?"
"Of course!"


"I used to have one like that but it got stolen."
"No you fucking didn't. Man get out of here."


"Hey lemme ride that thing!"
"No." 

"You made that?"
"Yes."
"Damn. So where'd you get that deck?"
"I pressed it and cut it myself."
"Oh shit alright. Where'd you get this box?"
"I sculpted a form and had a guy make them for me from fiberglass."
"Oh wow. These your branded motors too? Shit. What about the battery?"
"I build my own packs."
"The fuck? You made the battery too? What kind of grip is that?" 
"I crushed coke bottles and made the grip from the resulting sand."
 "Damn bro..."
"You want one?"
"Fuck yeah i want one."
"Hit me up."

"STOP RIDING THAT THING AROUND!!" screams the fat old lady barely controlling her yap dog who hates my motors more than it hates squirrels and mailmen. 
"STOP WALKING THAT STUPID YAP RAT AROUND!"

"YAP YAP YAP YAP YAP YAP YAPPPY YAPPY YAP YAP!"

woman: ''walking is allot healthier''
me: ''alright, do you want to give it a shot for 16km over rough terrain at 30 km/h''?
woman:''no, but I still believe walking is better''

mountain bikers always try to catch up, not realising I am at only 2/3rd of my throttle range most of the time. Then you get the ''not fair'' comment. In general, it would appear that those doing traditional ''non-powered'' sports dislike what they see and want to show that the traditional way is still the best.

OMG yes.  One guy was waiting at a 4-way stop sign in his truck and I was coming in perpendicular at 24mph.  He waited for me to get all the way there and then like a magic, I stopped at the stop sign.  I think I watched his head explode in disbelief.  He was like "HOW DID YOU DO THAT?"

"That's a cool board, dude.  I used to be a pro longboarder and [blah blah blah, snipped]"

I said "Did you ever learn how to do this?"  And I stepped off the front of the board, turned around, and shoved it away from me as fast as I could, then hit the throttle and drove it right back under my foot like a boomerang.

His eyes got really big and he just walked away.  His buddy turns to me and says, "Man, I think you just blew his mind"

What are the power-to-weight ratios for that 1989 Civic with you in it and your esk8 with you on it.  Because I bet the esk8 is higher...

## \#75 Posted by: Sn4pz Posted at: 2017-10-25T19:11:26.230Z Reads: 217

might be... lol


Assuming ( off the top of my head) the civic is probably 2150 pounds with that little flat 4 in it with 120/130 hp thats probably around 17/18

the esk8 ( averaging values here) probably produces around 10 hp(????) and saying the rider is around 180 pounds with a board that weighs 20/25 pounds?

thats around 20....

esk8 is the winner here! ( not by as much as i thought though)

edit: I was wrong! the board does have a higher ratio! I corrected my numbers :)

[/quote]

It's closer to around 2 hp per motor. Going with power to weight ratios calculations 
2150 lbs/130hp = 16.5lbs per hp.

Assuming dual motors with 3hp each
205lbs/6hp = 34.2lbs per hp

By math, your reasoning is invalid. The Civic is better.

Response: "Who gives a fuck if the helmet's gay. That's the Helmet's choice. What are you some fucking homophobe? worried my helmet is gonna make a pass at you? maybe give you a kissy face in front of your freinds? What kind of pussy is that threatened by a gay helmet? And what's wrong with gay anyway? You have any idea how fucking hardcore metal it is for a man to do that to another man..."

and then just watch their face change. And then if it doesn't change in the way you want smash their trump voting face with the helmet hard as you can and say a fag just beat them senseless and laugh. 

When you can't avoid idiotic low brow threatening behavior of an uninformed, ignorant, and phobic nature, use it against them and then drag thier egos into it to ice the cake.

Wow wasn't expecting this kind of response but I'm glad I got it. I totally agree with you. All the hate speech is very destructive. It runs rampant throughout high school making it a very hard place to be if you happen to be gay and in the closet. 

I am now a senior but the previous year were very hard on me. I had "friends" and even family members pressure me into relationships I didn't want. Despite what all my friend and family told me I never felt anything. It got to the point where I began to wonder if there was something wrong with me. I got really depressed and picked up the habit of saying fag and gay like my peers. I used the words out of hatred of what I though I might be and were a last ditch effort to convince myself I was straight. When I was really young I went to a private christian school when I learned "being gay" was very wrong a sin. That stuck with me and causing me to feel very uncomfortable with myself and deny my urges.

Anyways I somehow ended up with a really nice and understanding girl who helped me sort out my feelings. Since then I have come out to my closest friends and twin brother. I am now happier than I have been in quite some time :blush:. Can't wait to get away for everything when I start college.

Sorry for getting off topic lol

you do see that regardless of how you use the term, whether it's well intentioned or not, it is still demeaning and very insulting, right?

I called people gay all the time in high school. It wasn't meant to be demeaning but it was my smart ass comeback when someone tells me to ‚Äúsuck my d‚Äù. I would reply with ‚Äúwhat are you? Gay?‚Äù Which usually confuses them a bit as they re-evaluate their comment. 

Of course looking back, me calling them gay as an ‚Äúinsult‚Äù seems wrong on my part as well.

Sometimes people don't have to say anything. I was at a stoplight with my full face helmet and pads on, waiting for the light to change and a guy ona street bike pulled up next to me. Not sure what he was thinking of all my gear on skateboard in a flat town. When the light turned green, I took off (not trying to race him or anything), but grabbed a little too much throttle, popped a nice wheelie/manual for about the first 10 feet, and beat him across the intersection before he passed me. He turns his head to look back at me and gives me a big thumbs up. Wasn't expecting that, but then again,I don't think he was expecting me either.

The other day I was riding in the bike lane as always, cruising at like 12-15 mph, a road biker yelled out "this is a BIKE lane" as he passed, I speed up next to him and said "what did you say?"  We had a little bit of back and forth on  the whole strictly bike lane thing as he was huffing and puffing away and kept looking down at the mysterious machine under my feet, he wasn't backing off his selfish lane hogging arguments so I sped off.

My loss since he was getting a healthy exercise and I was holding a high fructose corn syrup beverage.

Also I don't actually like going that fast on my boards, but did it to prove a point and be egotistical, probably another point for him if I ate it.

A while ago some grandpa threatened to beat me up because he thought i destroyed his private property with my trampa board. 

Well, i was about 100m away from his property when he stopped me and i repeatedly told him that i didn't even want to ride on his shitty lawn that didn't even have any markings that it was private property. And neither was i riding on it nor does my trampa destroy any ground it rolls over. He also wanted to keep me from riding through the nearby forest.

I don't know what got in him, besides not listening to what i said he was about half my size and i honestly don't know what i would have done if he had actually attacked me. I would have been very afraid to really hurt him accidently if i had to push him away. :laughing:

I'm not sure where to start, but ---  if you had a Trampa board, you could have probably fled and probably outrun a car, much less an old man :rofl:

I never get off the deck or disengage the remote when someone wants to talk to me.  You never know anyway if they might try to steal it

Getting away wasn't the problem but i was really stunned by how much of a tantrum he threw because of nothing really. :laughing:

Usually i have no problem to stop if someone is interested in the board and i know most people around in some way because it's a pretty rural area. 

I don't know wether he meant to do that, but i had to stop because he and his dog effectively spanned the leash across the road i was driving on and i didn't want to drag the doggo after me, so i had to slow down :sweat_smile:

a few more thing i've heard non-esk8ers say, in no particular order:

"That IPA was really good, I thought the kale and tangerine really brought out the fullness and body."

"We shouldn't waste money on paving trails you can't drive on."
 
"Why do you need a helmet? its not like a motorcycle or something."

"Teachers should be armed and receive weapons training."

"What's wrong with having slaves?"

"I'll take a triple latte with sprinkles, please."

"Nobody goes to libraries anymore, i really don't see why they need money when we should be buying guns for teachers."

"10mph is pretty fast, don't you think?"

"do you have a moment to talk about our lord and savior [insert deity]?"

as i'm crawling out of a bush: "bet you won't get back on that thing again.. hahahaha... "

"what's in all these long boxes?"

"Man that think looks fast. What's it do, 15?"

"Sir you can't come in here with no shoes on, i told you once already."

WOOP! WOOP! "GET OFF THE SIDEWALK. THANK YOU."

REEEEEE CHEE CHEEE CHEEEE

"You should patent that thing before somebody steals your idea!"

"Is that electrified?" About 5 times
"How much?"
"Can I have a go?"

I actually had some guy come up and try to stand on the GT I was borrowing, should have let him jump up and nail the throttle :rofl:

Riding through the city you get some shithead drunks too, I heard numerous times at the back of the pack groups of guys say stupid crap like "We should knock one of them off" or "Who has that kind of money for that shit".
Not the nicest stuff to hear, but it was interesting to see just how much you hear when just cruising past.

Well you have probably never been in Czech beerhouse :) There are so many different types...I admit that most of our beer is made out of hops, but there are many different types we have here, you jsut have to try the smaller brands :)

i don't perceive the taste of leather and burned oak to taste very well.

And, ironically, I hate pilsners in general, yet somehow the people of SA have managed to brew a 6000 year old belgian pilsner recipe that makes my toes curl. 

yuengling has the oldest brewery in the united states. Meanwhile they were the best craft beer of the US in 2016. Its also my go-to favorite when i'm not in a place that serves more exotic shit i haven't tried yet. and i drink a hell of a lot of it. 

And Dos Equis... That poor german bastard had to move to mexico to brew the way he wanted. Probably for all the same reasons I always bitch about when i go off ranting about how we're murdering the traditional craft beers.

Speaking of beer.

Last beer run I had just taken a shower so my hair was down. I was pulling a full Jesus.

An older man in line in front of me turned around and said, "couple thousand years to early?"

With six 6-packs in my arms, I looked at him and said, "Yea, dad is really pissing me off, none of my people listen, and I'm tired of turning water to wine. So I figured I'd come down here and partake with my people." Looks down at arm's full of beer.

I don't think he was expecting me to understand his Revelations reference.. lol

Their IPA's pretty awesome too. Couple honorable mentions: Lagunitas little sumpin', and Great White.
