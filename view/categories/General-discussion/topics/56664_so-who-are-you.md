So I find myself doing a good bit of talking on here with people and I have no clue what they look like. I know that is the nature of the beast, but I want to see who people are.

Like "oh, he looks like a dude I would have a beer with."

Or, "that figures, he has a really punchable looking face."

Or, "Damn, I didn't realize @whoever was a fucking dinosaur."

So, who are you? If you dare....

Selfies welcome.

A lifetime ago I worked for Lucent installing 5ESS for telcos all over the US.  It was an amazing job, and I loved it.  After 9/11 I worked at 140 West for 3 months getting a 7R/E (probably the only one in existence) up and running.  After that investment dried up and the bottom fell out.  It was fun while it lasted.  Working with smart, funny, technical fun-loving people was the best!

Now I work in a windowless flourescent-lit room.  Not that its bad mind you, just different.  I miss working with my mind AND my hands.

Well, I'm one of the few who has an actual pic in my avatar, and it pretty much sums it up.  Family guy, 2 dogs, software and data analytics.  Really looking forward to having my board built so I can cruise down to the beach at lunch and clear my head.

:) likewise. 

My two sons have Aspergers (and therefore ‘social media’ does not yet compute) so we decided a long time ago to never post pics so they wouldn’t one day log in and see all these pics of them from before their early intervention, PT, OT, ABA and Verbal Behaivor therapies. We don’t want to take away their right to create their identity. 

![image|665x499](upload://nwoAfkVzNqWhojLCY2M1V1ZW3Et.jpeg)

Behold, the first pic of me and my son online (from last night). Hamilton County MRDD told me this one would never live unassisted and had an IQ of 90. 

Twelve years and one ocean of therapy costs later, Nick graduated last night from one of America’s top private high schools with scholarship offers from six universities.  Nick does not have the physical coordination for sport - so to become a student coach, he attended every single game from every single sport his high school offered until they took him on as a student coach. 

Then, they won state. Nick was honored along with all athletes, equally.

Not long ago sold my DM9 and another cheap marker, too many hobbies!

My two boys (one is fresh at 8 weeks), beer brewing, work and finishing my mba leaves me with JUST enough time to ride and browse the forum. Hope to get out and meet some members once my board is running reliably.

Wow. Love seeing all the happy skater faces and their family.

Scans from the fall I had on mother’s day here Sunday the 13th. I was carving hard and the board slipped from under me whilst I rode over some plant debris near the edge of the bike path. Broken shoulder, broken clavicle, and broken rib which gave me a partially collapsed lung

I'm a student studying mechatronic engineering at Chico State. I work at the Grow Manufacturing Initiative, with the goal of connecting advanced manufacturers with educators in order to create a more advanced workforce for the future. I enjoy 3d printing, paintballing (thought I'd mention because everyone else is 😂), and creating things. I was the president of FRC team 4643 Thunderbird Robotics for most of my high school years.

Hi there! Björn from The Netherlands. 40 yo, two kids, one wife.

Have been wanting an electric skateboard since forever, but don't want to risk fines, and worse, insurance that doesn't want to pay in case of an accident, because Dutch law still prohibits the use of electric skateboards.
As soon as out lawmakers come out of their cave and start living in 2018 I'll buy myself a nice board :slight_smile:

Great thread, everyone is much older than I thought ahhahaahha! Probably why this forum is such high quality ;)

I don't update fb and am pretty private on social media so this might be more information than I've ever posted ha!

I don't play in a band, just crashed this one. They seemed to like me since they let me play 75min with them. And it's what my leg looked like the next morning from slamming the tambourine on it. (This was last week BTW)

Just a thought @mmaner, could you maybe change the name of this topic? The way the search engine works it lists the most recent topics and posts with the words: "who/are & you" in them with a priority on the first word listed in the most recent post...

I searched for this topic when I caught the above post with three of the above 4 words to be prompted my search term was not long enough.

TLDR: Tittle is not unique enough & it makes this topic hard to search for.

First of all, I fucking love Ron Swanson, but he pales in comparison to the Legend status of my Pops.  

I want to fire this bitch!  I didn't know we had it until 2 hours ago.  Firing this bitch is now my main goal for Thanksgiving.  Everything seems fine and solid as shit.  

Amazing mother fuckers lined up and fired these bitches at eachother.  Makes me feel lucky I had the experiences I did in some ways.  Terrifies me just thinking about how men went to war in the past.

But, it is all stupid bullshit and we should be working together as a mother fuckin' species to get off this death rock and expand.... but thats just my $.02

Unbelievably stable. The front truck is an ats 12 skate truck too. Only complaint is turning radius. I'm on loose bushings and can only barely make 90 degree street turns. My new board is 2 ats 12 trucks and, go figure, double the turning radius.

As i dont dj a lot anymore, im getting a teenage engineering OP Z  for myself for Christmas and a set of minirigs so i can make my own beats on the fly, if you like samplers and techno and who doesn't, checkout the OP Z  or the PO 33 ko from teenage engineering...if ya haven't already that is.

I thought I reminded myself of someone else. Lol. What can I say... I got this dope @lazyrolling hoodie today, threw it on, looked at myself in the mirror and thought somethings missing. Just so happen to have a pair of Aviation sunglasses nearby for some odd reason and boom, the look was complete. Too bad some asshole had to taint that look 30 years ago. Screwed up my whole plan to get my hoodie decades later after eSk8ing had been invented and become the uphill ESk8 bomber. Foiled again. :roll_eyes:

@venom121212 Well, I would have been about 8 years old in that last pic, so hopefully the FBI is smart enough to know it wasn't me. :sunglasses:

Hey guys, Andrew here. 

Born in Hawaii, grew up in Encinitas, CA, moved to Oregon when I was 13 and it's been home since. I worked in robotics for about a decade before switching engineering fields to have more time to enjoy life. Picked up skating again, and esk8 about a month after, and I've been building DIY boards for myself and friends for the last year or so. Looking forward to seeing some of you at Barrett Junction!

We already had it on a 430HP LS3 w/ a military grade Howe & Howe tracked base with diff steering. Granted the MK3 is 16 ft tall and weighs 12 tons, so max speed was about 16mph. 

MegaBots was the project, there was a web series produced that tracked a lot of the build progress starting at the mk1. We debuted the Eagle Prime MK3 last year at Bay area maker faire, but I honestly had a minor role overall, just some control systems stuff & vision systems for the pilots- it took 16 engineers 2.5 years to build that Mech.

LoL I decided not to pursue the job at that company.  I had gotten an offer from Berlin and I blew them off.  Then not a couple weeks later, Trump was elected, and I called the company back like "Hey, what's up"

Short story: almost moved to Germany.  Housing in Berlin sucks.  Also, I need gigabit fiber.  Why?  Because it's 2018.  So I stayed in downtown Saint Louis where it's cheap and awesome -- except for Trump

Known for being point man in paintball games, and getting chain rings and studded pedals stuck in my leg. esk8 is my latest foray after the last two interests, which was using a DJ MTB for urban obstacle jumping, and then a more sedate but nevertheless tough foray into long distance running.

I'm Nicklas, I'm 19 (20 Next week) years old from Denmark.

I love working, and improving things and proving that I can do the impossible.
I love working with other people and designing things and getting something new and innovative out there.

And of course i enjoy this hobby, and making a living of it makes it even better.

And since everyone has a board in one of their pictures i just took one for the sake of it.

Honestly the following was pretty great. The fans were super supportive. But the reality of building and maintaining a 4+ million dollar mech is pretty rough, so keeping it sustained with momentum isn't cheap or easy. As you can imagine, salary for 15+ engineers working full-time adds up over the years, and this was a passion project through and through. Thanks for the support!

And just for you, bonus behind-the-scenes shot of the double barreled 6" paintball cannon:

Hey @Sender, thanks for the shout out.  You’re right I guess I should post more.  No mystery, I haven’t bought a computer for over 10 years, so I’m on an iPad, with no keyboard.  So, easier to read than to post!  I try and post if I can help someone out, but I’m usually beaten to it by someone much more knowledgeable.

My name is Nass,(not so great in German, I know).  I’m 48 in a few days time, and I live in London.  I don’t take selfies of just me, and don’t really feel comfortable posting pictures of other people on the internet.  Thinking about it, the last picture of me alone is probably in the possession of the Sussex Constabulary, who kindly put me up for the night in exchange for just my mugshot and fingerprints.  Kind of wish I’d asked for a copy now.

Once again, appreciate the call out.  I somehow feel a bit more part of this great community now, and who knows, I might even get a new computer for my birthday, and then I’ll try and post more!

Not sure i would use the word "real" its more about human stories.

Patterson invented Bigfoot in 1967, Betty and Barney Hill invented alien abduction in 1961. The Fox sisters invented Spiritualism in 1850, etc.

One of my favorite stories is Mothman in West Virginia, 1966. That tale has it all. 

But real crypto creatures? Maybe Homo Floresiensis and Orang Pendek. Check that out.

He's the reason I threw that dinghy together and has been cruising it around the house recently. We'll see what happens!

I used a BKB motor mount.  Dead simple.  Works great.  I will take some pictures later and send them to you.


It is a really fun little rig.

The motor amps are set to like 26 or something 30 batt amps.  

I have a grown up mode on it too that is a blast because you feel like you will die. Double cone bushings front and back that are soft as shit so the little dude can actually turn.

Aside from being a living talking tree...

I head up project management for a tech firm in Boston.
Original from Taiwan and spend a good chunk of my life in Thailand before popping state side.

Really big into Whiskey, Corgis, ESK8.
I currently have 5 working boards. 3 that I built.
If you count rebuilts I am probably in the double digits as this point.  
I have also been helping the folks in Taiwan ESK8 with DIY

Heres my whiskey bar at work

Current project:
I'm working on getting metasurf's DD onto board up foldup board.
DD has a really small foot print and allows for a smoother ride compared to hubs due to the extra thane.  I think this would be a great travel board that doesn't completely suck in terms of performance.  Expected 30mph

Yub. 
I run the whiskey tasting club and the bar at work.
We got whiskey to sip and appreciate, to drink and enjoy, and to put in your coffee for those days.
Its a great channel for folks top and down the company to mingle and get to each other.
We are lucky enough to have some really heavy hitters cross the club.
A bottle of 33 y/o and as well as the Best Single Malt Whiskey in the world by the 2015 World Whiskies Awards had both graced the bar.  :slight_smile:

Hey guys, I like to say I'm a pretty interesting individual lol. I'm just really random and like just about everything. I used to trick skate back in my day as a teen as a fruitbooter but I eventually started started skateboarding too. I'm 31 and mother of 2 girls. I love building stuff but more than anything, I'm a musician. I'm into drawing and graphic design as well as producing, djing, performing, and tinkering. I'm friendly, a social butterfly you could say lol. Probably why people want me to gig so often but I recently moved to Ohio for financial reasons and I'm slowly getting back into the music scene. I used to gig every week at least back in Philly/Jersey area. I love ramen, I'm glad to have met a couple folks on here who helped me out with my crazy build mistakes. I've been into 3d printing for the past year or so. I'm a disabled Army vet as well. Oh, and I love animals.

Aloha, my name is Dusten and im an addict.. Got sucked into this forum fall of 2017 after riding an evolve bamboo for a couple monthd looking for power upgrades. Born near Seattle and lived in that area the majority of my life. I used to be in graphic production for a trade show company but have been living off unemployment since moving to the Big Island of Hawaii last september with my wife. We are transforming our jungle acre into an off-grid sanctuary. I love bass music, not rave music.. My wife and I both enjoy circus prop manipulation and fire spinning. Building things was my addiction even before esk8, so it was easy to dive in head first. I also like playing instruments like flute, ukulele and hand drums. ![20190131_165023|374x500](upload://nytJem6DCGmgJanQQPZI2QUbO2t.jpeg) ![20190131_164939|666x500](upload://o5nMkEQNoV84bsiLQkVj0LxvjuM.jpeg)

Rope dart is alot of fun. If you're good with staff try meter (basically rope staff) . Its in the same family as rope dart actually. 
You can do most staff tricks and some poi tricks as well.

It's pretty much two long poi tied together.
You can go all chain but I like nylon in the center to give a little bit of spring for really high tosses.

I use to build huge drones for hobby and buisiness.   I made good money repairing dji phantoms before the 3 came out. Now I moved to Esk8 and been building since 2014.    Ive been helping Subsonic launch an electric line so look out for some hi end boards using parts all over this forum.

The only social media I will participate in so heres me.....

30 year old, Texas born, living in San Francisco. In month I will finally defend my thesis and graduate with my Masters in Chemistry. 

For work, I teach a large variety of chemistry courses from organic to analytical. While I’ve enjoyed my two years teaching, I’m about to travel south and look for a higher pay. So around May I’ll be moving out of my insanly expensive San Francisco apt for a cheaper one in SoCal.

I’m pretty much a loner. Esk8 has been a nice release from all the other bullshit life can throw.

Edit: my field doesn’t certainty doesn’t have as much to offer as you engineers, but I would certainly like to be able to give back to the community. I can offer metal testing though XRF to determine purity of steels from overseas. I specialize in analytical chemistry because that where the money is. I have access to amazing and expensive analytical instruments, but I really don’t know what else I can offer.

lazy or lucky AF -- it would have been nice not to worry about whether I'd be eating and/or homeless if an emergency expense occurred until after I was 25.

Now I've mostly got my shit together, but having training wheels on for the first few years of adulting would have saved me from a few twitches (I tend to stop eating enough when the pantry isn't full enough, mild panic attacks if the power goes out)

Ok after multiple call outs this is what you're gonna get.  
I'm Daren.  I was born in Dublin, Ireland, moved to London at aged 2 and then moved to Australia when I was 40.  Confusing during the rugby world cup I can tell you.  
I have a business degree but couldn't run a business if my life depended on it.  Oh wait a minute it kind of does.  I have a small Building company and am a qualified plumber/electrician.
And in the immortal words of Forest Gump
"thats all I'm going to say about that"

And again.  Shes kind of hogging the limelight.


As for the kids well theres 4 of them ranging from 11 to 22.  
Got no pics of the eldest boys to hand and my daughter is too gorgeous to share on a site that has 14 year old boys on it.
My little demon though, well you can have a pic of him being awesome.

I know it’s super easy said, but you are the only one who really can get yourself out of any shit in life. There things which fuck you up, there are people who fuck you up, but nothing ever should influence you that much that you suffer from it. Life is good, keep focusing on the positive sides and keep things going with skating and esk8ing. There is so much potential of getting energy out of it. Use it 😉

I have heard that about some tattoo studios from the girl that does my tattoos.  When I first went to her she was at a shop as an apprentice and was stuck doing the grunt work and all the shitty ideas that the "experienced tattooers" didn't want to do but it helped her develop her skills because she did so many weird and off the wall things.  That shop sucked because when my wife and I went in there felt like we were looked down on and like we were not supposed to be there.  When she left she took us and all the other people who she had done tattoos on with her to her new shop and that was a very look laid back shop.  Just gotta look around and find the best shop for you

A Japanese men born and raised in the Netherlands. (kinda unique right haha)
I still live in the Netherlands (The Hague) and I'm working full time as a graphic designer/business developer for a wind energy company. 
I've been into skimboarding since I was 14-years old (since the beach is like 10min. away from my house) and always liked to cruise with my pennyboard in the Tokyo Area during my internships in Japan. (btw the skating law in Japan sucks massive)


Hope to buy an electric skateboard soon when the dutch law approves light weighted vehicles on the public road to get rid of my bike and get on the board to my work :smiley:

Yo! You climb pretty hard?  What style of climbing are you into?

I own a couple bouldering gyms here in Alabama.  I used to fucking crush back in the day, but the gym has burned me out a bit and 3 kids don't make it any easier to get to the crag... thus, ESK8!

Yes, i spend a lot of time in the KI Innsbruck (climbing gym). But i absolutely love to climb vertical mountains. The highest grade Boulder i finally completed was a 7a (European scale).
The hardest trad route we did was a 6b in the dolomites. Yeah i think i would stop climbing risky stuff as soon as i would have a Family, it can get dangerous sometimes.

10 damn year ago I was climbing 8a+/8b sport, 7c+ or so on the boulders and would mess aroud with up ro 7c+ on trad lines.

I pretty much just set problems at the gym now and occasionally make it out to go Bouldering. Haven't gone route climbing in a couple years. I will probably rediscover my love for it when the kids get a bit older and we aren't tied to the gym anymore.
