Hey, guys so I want to build a super long range esk8 on a spud or a Tayto, I've talked about 10s6p on a previous thread but @Eboosted updated the spud DS enclosure to be able to fit 12s6p... 

Now just a very simple question (not) how much would the board weigh? the parts im thinking of using.

_Fatboy Nano_ on _E Calibers_
_Maytech 6355 sealed_
_12s6p_ (72 Cells) (i have enough cells)
_Focbox unity_  (i have on preorder)
_Tayto or spud_ (i have on hand)
Eboosted _Spud DS enclosure_
Abec 11 107mm refly

I've done some rough calculations on weight but couldn't find info on some parts (used the search bar a metric shit ton)

12s6p on LG HG2 cells are roughly 7.8LB
2 maytech 6355 are roughly 2.96LB
Abec 11 107mm refly roughly 4.45LB


Brings the build-up to 15.21LBS

I need help finding the weight on the rest of the parts...

I have the same excat setup - the battery. I'm running 5 2s lipo's and my board weighs 21lbs. Even if you subtract 3lbs for my battery you will end up with around 30lb board. 
You will be buff in no time. Just start curling the baord

I mean without the _deck_ the _enclosure_ and the _gear drive_ and _trucks_ the board is around 15.21LBS

so unless gear drive + trucks + enclosure + deck weighs 15lbs... i dont see a 30lb board

my 10s3p on focboxes + rspec kit is 21lbs...

It looks like it will be close to 26lbs...If you're gonna be carrying up and down a dozen flights of stairs a day you're probably wish you went for a slimmer battery

Why do you need that much range

Building a long range board or anything in the 5p/6p range, I care very little about weight.

In fact, I don't overly concern myself about weight in general when building ELECTRIC skateboards that aren't for my little children...

Put the battery in a backpack and have a magnetic plug hang down from it and a port on the board, at least you'll be able to pick it up and carry it

Long range and lightweight do not play along together. Get the 12s3p with kegels, pretty nice lightweight board I ride it myself when I go to places where I need to mall grab it. 

Otherwise I like to ride my 12s5p sidekick

Or get the 12s6p, 100mm boas and forget about the weight

I care a lot about weight.  That's why I have short range boards and long range boards.  On the long range boards, weight is not a factor in the design.  On the short range boards, it's a bigger factor.  But not such a big factor as to not use humongous wheels.

For a 72 cell board, it's going to be super-heavy no matter what you do.  You really, really, really will want some sort of kayak handle or fabric handle and balanced in the center of mass along the board.

If you have to have long-range, and weight is an issue, that pretty much means you should go single-motor.  Have you considered a single 6374 on the rear heelside?  A 6374 is heavier than a 6355 but it's definitely lighter when you don't need the other motor, you don't need the other motor mounts, and you don't need the other ESC.

Just carry the board, become something that resembles an arm wrestler, win arm wrestling competitions. Profit.

(Talking as a guy who's building a dual 6374, pneumatics, belt driven, 12s6p)

When you arrive at the destination, curl it. When you arrive home, curl it. Bonus points for doing it while standing. You will BUFF your hand in no time. :smiley:

(Just make sure to take breaks in between the reps. :laughing:)

It's common for first builders to want to build the first eboard with all features:

1. A very long range battery but keeping the esk8 realy light
2. Get the best parts in the market but keeping budget low
3. A very high top speed with a monster torque
4. A huge battery under the deck but it must look sleek
5. A board with streets wheels that can be swapped to AT easily

However, as everything in life, success is archived when you find the balance, the best eboard would be the one that suits your main gol, do not try to score everything or you will be derailed soon.
