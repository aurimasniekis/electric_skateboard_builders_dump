Hey guys

I have been talking with the guys of the Caliber Truck Co. to make a truck especially for the diy esk8 community.

They are interested but because opening a new mould is very expensive I proposed to start with the caliber trucks as we know them but with longer axles in them (like the TB trucks).

This would make dual 6355 sensored with 15mm wheels pulleys with bearing possible on a caliber truck! :) 

They sent me this picture:
![image|690x458](upload://7HlA6DCdYnpGBtLhEgsXdbLLSod.jpg)

They ofcourse need "big" quantity to do this, this is why I would like to do this poll, to see if their is some interest :)

[poll type=regular public=true]
* Yes, I'm interested in a pair!
* No

If we're making a custom truck for esk8, i'd like to have the mount built/cast in. Kind of like on the Evolve trucks.

that sound rly awesome. i mean most people have a mount for a caliber truck or they already have a build in solution right?
dunno how much the people are into the build in version.

---
## \#15 Posted by: Bor.inc Posted at: 2018-07-03T20:34:00.882Z Reads: 628

I think the mount in truck version can be quite useful because it eliminates that extra clamp in a motormount kit and you dont have to bolt in on the truck. 
The one thing that can be a bit more difficult is the placement of the built in clamp, because how much space do you need to fit the motormount, pulley and wheel?

Awesome idea!

i think other shops are probably also want to buy these extended calibers, maybe even "normal" Skateshops, so i guess the most likely route will be without build in clamps. just my opinion, i could be dead wrong.

you guys seem to forget that as soon as you have such a long axle you can use a sleeve instead of a clamp to hold your motor mount: problem solved. Somebody just has to do the design work and have them made.

Just check this out - it might give you an idea of what I mean:
https://shop.3dservisas.eu/collections/fatboy/products/fatboy-mini-drive-train-1-3-for-torqueboards-218mm-trucks?variant=6605335265307

Or this
https://www.trampaboards.com/mountainboard-motor-mount-t6-truck-connector--p-12908.html

I designed something similar for my inner gear drive for 6inch pneumatics. Basically the "clamp" part is a sleeve with a hole for the axle. The wheel will push it against the hanger and the rectangular shape of the hanger keeps it from moving around.

Also make sure that the pulley fits either around the sleeve or can sit flush on the outside. I am not sure what type of design the axle length allows but using a sleeve should make for a bullet proof mount that does not go anywhere even under heavy vibrations.

I think the main take away from this is that Caliber see revenue in the esk8 community. If anyone from Caliber reads this, show some faith and just make what we need. This hobby is rocketing in popularity and these builders have deep pockets and can't stop tinkering. First board paves the way to the second "perfect board", which paves the way to the new "perfect board" and so on and so on...

Invest in us, see what happens.

Am I the only one being interested in a **shorter** RKP Caliber 2 truck or a **TKP** Caliber 2 truck for e-skate ? I mean we got plenty of wide trucks already to use with motor mounts.

What about something really new : 
- A Caliber 2 RKP style hanger for TKP truck (I mean the simple shape to put motor mount on it), say hello to super nimble boards
- A Caliber 2 RKP made for straight or almost straight **hub motor mounting** instead of the generic ones, say hello to higher ride quality stealth boards
- A very narrow RKP Caliber 2 truck for penny board builds and very slim boards, with just enough room to fit motor mounts so it doesn't look goofy and kicking the wheels by accident becomes irrelevant, say hello to monster penny !

I really don't care about a wider truck, but I give you respects for talking it out with the brand !

I don’t think wider axels would fix the issues because many people use 6374 or and they need a wider hanger to fit them on you will be limiting yourself to a 6355 motor with the standard hanger from caliber.

yes but 6355 sensored or waterproof is not possible atm with 15mm belts right? A longer axle would give that extra bit of room :slight_smile:

i personally dont want to go so wide as tb218 or evolve trucks. i like the width of caliber and that bit extra makes it possible to have enough space for dual and extra wide belts or other drive systems. 
Also lets not forget that this solution is not a big hassle for caliber, which is good for all the eskater with not big of a budget.
Before i would go dual 6374, i would probably go AWD with smaller motors, i know that defies the budged argument.

Hey guys

I ordered the trucks :slight_smile:

You can buy them here in Pre-sale: https://electricboardsolutions.com/products/caliber-truck-ii-50-with-extended-axle-pre-sale-pair

If there is interest to get them to the US maybe someone can organise a groupbuy?

I ma think at making a direct drive. Shouldn't be that difficult. But I think that a truck with almost all axeles would be better. Similar to the Maytech ones for belt drive system. Than you would need only to adapt a hub motor for that.

I think thats a different truck they already are using @dareno 

 nice with a truck smaller than TB 218 (which btw has 1mm thicker hanger) that comfortably fits 6355 with wide belts.

If you use pulleys with bearings in the back, would you then use spacers in the front to get the same track width?

The longer axle allows easier fitting of push fit pulleys and comfortable 15mm belts, probably 20?

Largely though, the more interest we all show here through purchasing and positive support the more likely bigger established brands will take note of esk8 and start making molds for us.

But really though, with shipping and currency conversion (~90USD) I'd be better off buying TB's 218's. If we can get these in a large quantity in the US I'm sure they would sell. Regular Cal ii's cost around $50 in the US. 218's are $65.

We'll have precision trucks coming out soon. Almost done with final testing and will most likely go with Titanium Axles. Same truck set that will work with our direct drive setup.

Of course, 218mm TB Trucks will be much cheaper though. I'll see if I can upgrade the axles on 218s.

youre doing an 8mm axle with the long hanger that holds the DD motors!?  Maybe Im missing something.  that seems an awful long span that will get a lot of leverage no?  why not do at least 10mm or something.  maybe the aluminum is a good stiff support...still seems safer to skip the aluminum around it and do all steel axle if you dont want to change the rest of the design.  im surprised but maybe its totally strong enough just seems an easy additional security with something other than just 8mm inside.

## \#129 Posted by: torqueboards Posted at: 2018-08-09T19:59:36.568Z Reads: 308

Only the outside of the insert is 8mm. Axle will only hold the wheel itself 25mm. Motor sits on the truck hanger with a 16mm diameter. I'm sure it will be fine. Will do some beta testing though with it first.

Not necessarily, welding the hanger inherantly weakens the aluminum of the hanger if not done well. Sometimes the only way to get there mount perfect is to weld it. So compromises.

You are right. When I look up yield strengths of high strength titanium and steel, it shows to be 120,000 psi and 230,000 psi. Cool, but maybe @torqueboards knows the exact values for the ones used the trucks in general. I agree with hummie. If the hangers are longer, I would definitely feel safer with a stronger central shaft. Maybe go with 10mm shaft that is turned down to 8mm towards the end?

are you using pulleys with bearing? I have more space between my motors :slight_smile:

Nope without bearing, but since unik mounts have a horizontal beam i can't change the space between my motors, could probably fit a 18mm pulley though :wink:

Should not be a problem, at most you might feel like your board carves a bit more. I tried it out on my peanut butter sandwich powered board and did not really feal anything different. 

I decided to go for 2 because I might want to try slapping on some pneumatics in the future to see what that feels like.

6354, 15mm belts, pulley with integrated bearing.

With the space left you can probably fit some 6365 motors.

Also if you have extra space that you're not needing and want to pull out you could measure the difference, use a die to drive the thread back further on the axle, and cut and clean up the end of the axle off that you don't need.

Thank you sir..so I guess we're at this point come on @lever. We need to get rid of these impossible to find and  buy without selling your kids or your yourself to the street corner for flywheel junk..let's get these new adapters rolling for us boa keegal lovers..real thane..not wobbly jello..I'd love a speed vent adapter personally.. the best wheel around ..one of my favorites to push and ride on the quality is key with seismic..soft and roll properly no drag and fast ..not wobbly like my flywheel junk. My clones are better balenced then the flywheel...not impressed for that money I spent on them..I see why my DH riding friends hate them so much.. quality suck..never mind never have them in stock to buy what's the point of having wheels and trucks to never have them for sale doesnt make sense

Is it not more likely that they are the same as the standard ones but because of the longer axle they feel softer since you have a greater lean on them now because of you know physics?

The same goes for door handles in homes for the elderly. They are longer so they are easier to push down to open the door. 
Because older people are weaker than us ahem youngsters they need that.
