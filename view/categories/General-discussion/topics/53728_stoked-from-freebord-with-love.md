Pretty stoked how they reacted on my instagram few minutes ago. I've been supporting and using a lot of different products cause I just like diversity, creativity and get my ride to reflect my tastes/attitude.

I just leave this here. No sure this is how a company should act towards what they call "ESK8ers". 

I strictly don't support there attitude which is totally against (from my perception) towards unity and bringing people together. 

So yo know what? We are going to make our own bindings :slight_smile:

After you design those superior bindings (foot hookers?), make sure to push them hard on the Freebord crowd. Shouldn't be too hard to make a design that's at least lighter and more comfortable. I bet they would be super duper stoked if you could get rid of ALL of those pesky customers. If they don't have a need for supplying and stocking those annoying "products", all of their supply problems are solved! 😃

I really have huge respect for their company and I was really surprised with how they got in touch with me and their attitude. I can understand that this may create a challenge for their stock inventories but men, this is good business and a way to unite people. 

I'm just wondering why they don't just use this as a marvelous business opportunity. I mean. Freebord Hooks are popular and I just love riding them. All the joint initiatives are always a move forward in our societies and a lot of us would love to support them if needed.

I already got a tested design (3D printed and composite) and rode mine for few months but then I moved to other topics but if people want, we can all work to unite and make this a reality and share the risk & rewards.

I have a freebord and got bindings for my builds too. I can understand that they can't stock enough for freeborders but i can't understand why they can't see the business here. They should increase the production of bindings and promote them in the electric world. Good for our needs and good for their company. They made a HUGE mistake posting those comments and changing attitude.
Microplane tools were made for wood but people started using them for cooking because they were great for It. They created a kitchen division and now they sell double. That's how serious business must be run.

Astounding....A company that doesn't want to sell more products...... What a joke. I'll make sure to put them on my list of DO NOT BUY FROM vendors. 


Talk about shooting yourself in the foot.....That's what happens when you have a company ran by a bunch of clowns:

![image|690x329](upload://mAU5WnRi14wyHPKZ52kdkPTNjs6.jpg)

I would make sure it's the real 'freeboard' and not a spook account. If it is in fact real...I don't even know what to say. 

I tried to do a group buy for S2 bindings a while back and they would only knock 5 bucks off the price for 20. So, yeah.  Won't be buying from them anymore. 

Can't believe you got treated like that @okp, by a company that was making a profit on us regardless of their inventory issues.

I have a set mounted I really like the concept...the price was a little off putting but I was going to pay the rrp for another set soon, but of course at €70 they can stick them where the sun shines.

You know what there are flaws in their design and I have paper napkin plans to fix those major flaws -
You can't quickly change from regular to goofy.
You can't quickly change the mount height.

@okp hit me up if you want to produce it and especially so if you don't care who wants them

They should definetly be called foot hookers :joy:

Not trying to defend the guy because he definitely could have been more polite about it, but maybe he doesn't have much respect for eboarders after seeing leiftech copy every single evolution of their gear without giving an ounce of credit where due, and outsourcing their production to China instead of striking a deal with them for decks & wheels & whatnot.
And maybe eboarders using their binding really are just not much of a market at the moment. Depends on the margin they take on these parts but I can see how ending with having to reorder a few parts ahead of schedule when the rest of the stock is still in the green would constitute an annoyance. Maybe he doesnt give a shit about money and just enjoyed his life as it used to be. I mean you gotta respect that, right?

I also like diversity and the freedom of choice.
Imagine Trampa would stop selling decks because someone could mount MBS trucks or stop selling hanger because someone machines them for his product.....

If freebord sells more bindings than expected they should order a bigger batch next time, economy is fluid not static. And they should be happy that esk8ers doing promotion for freebord by using these bindings. I really don't understand their problem.

I perceive the following outcome. Freebord just pissed of a large group of costumers, that still want their product. However, since from now on there products will be unobtainable, someone will take on the task of creating a similar product with similar function. As this is a DIY forum and many members on this forum are business owners (which like to make money and sell products), production will be assured due to the relative demand for this product. Creating, in my opinion, a weak future for Freebord as esk8 is becoming more and more mainstream.

I also bought  S2 bindings from @okp but am not sure if I gonna use it.

I would really appreciate and love to see a new development of better bindings .....
Hey they said " Use your creativity and create your own" :wink:

The S2 seems old school to me, very heavy steel plate btw
A similar binding with (black anodized) aluminium plate and some padding inside of the plastic would be much better IMO

Unik bindings.... do it, do it, do it :drooling_face:

Hey guys... i will lower the price back down to $39 just for you guys ;).. but i urge you guys to be innovative.. dont be pissed.. everyother board sport w/ bindings designed their own bindings at one point..

The point is just be innovative like you guys are and create something rad for your rides.. sounds like you are already doing it.. no hard feelings.. but yeah we will drop the prices.. however we have to put a cap on it if you guys start buying us out.. lol.. so again thats why we are encouraging you to make your own designs.. if leif tech could sell you bindings thats great, but similar to us they dont operate to just sell bindings.. if we did or manufactured 1000's more to sell to you guys then it would make sense.. but you guys arent buying in the 1000's because there just arent that many of you.. so im sorry this upsets you.. but logistically we will have an uneven amount of bindings vs boards for our customers and distributors.. we have to plan our manufacturing with the seasons which makes it difficult to go deep into bindings early.. so with that said i hope you guys understand we mean no harm to you or your sport.. so we will bring the prices back down, but at a certain point we will have to slow it back down again.. sometimes being fully transparent hurts, but i hope you guys take this as an opportunity to evolve your sport..

Nobody cares that you raised/lowered the price. It's funny that you still don't understand that. 

Everyone cares that you were a complete dushbag for no reason to people that were buying/promoting your products. 

People here DO know what its like to buy/sell/stock product. There are a lot of members here who own and run businesses that sell way more product than you do.  There is definitely a better way to go about out it. 

Sometimes being close minded about your audience hurts your business in an unrecoverable way, but I hope you guys take this an an opportunity to evolve your business practice.

Yes.. but from our perspective we want to see you guys innovate for your system and to get you guys to rally we viciously ravaged a key player in the game.. lol.. seriously though we love you guys.... i myself have built quite a few diy boards.. ill share with you this summer..

no doubt.  sometimes it's one of those cant see the forest for the trees situations.  You've been dong this for so long, invested so much time and money, reached the point where its almost self-sustaining...it cant be that I hate it!  The thing is, a business is never self-sustaining.  It's a leech that will suck all of your time and money straight out of your veins, if you let it.  

I am getting the feeling this cat is having one of those crisis and sees us as the problem.  His decision making skills are crap too.  He's a either a liar with all this "tough love" bullshit or he's just inherently dishonest if his go to is to try to manipulate people instead of talking to them.  Either way, I'm glad to know the facts now.  

I bought a freebord deck with the intention of making an esk8 with it.  Turns out it's a pretty terrible deck.  Freebord wheels are essentially useless for anything but freebord, wear out to quick for even that.  The one good product he has he just flushed...so, yeah.  Good luck.

You guys are funny... this is fun.. so what did we figure out here? You guys are going to start making rad bindings for your rad boards? You guys are going to hate Freebord for taking an aggressive approach to informing you on our sales of individual bindings to you guys? 

What we didnt learn is why would someone at Freebord troll a member of the diy esk8 community? We have seen a handful of theories, but do they add up? Maybe its a blend of the ones you guys came up with and the excuses from the source its self? Will you ever know? Maybe not, but one thing is clear it was fun and the fun of getting your panties in a bunch has worn off.. keep doing what you guys are doing...

stoked.. with love..

He's welcome to email me at bara@enertionboards.com if he wants to talk about being an actual member of this community. Many companies come to this forum for information about what true Esk8ers like.  With over 9000 members, we're not a force to be taken lightly for esk8 companies


Take this example, your friend is looking for a board. He isnt sure what he wants though. So he asks his 1 friend who is really into esk8. We will all be sure to not mention Freebord now.

If you need bindings or foot hooks on your SKATEBOARD then you are doing it wrong..its a great way to get stuck, trip over yourself, and eat the cement...I prefer my decks clear of obstructions so I can use it as intended..if I wanted a connection between me and the wheels I would take up roller skating like the rest of the girls have been doing lately....

If you need to put electronic crap on your SKATEBOARD then your are doing it wrong.

God, these traditionalist enforceful opinions are killing me. F#ck off and let people decide what they want to ride and how.

Personally think these hooks offer the perfect balance between bindings and nothing at all. Adds to safety, since you can more easily jump off if needed. Instead of being stuck, not allowing for a graceful dismount.

Hi Okp!

I'm sorry for the fuss arround the bindings. The comments made on the account 'Freeboard' are from an individual that works in our social media department. We do not stand behind his comments and he has been spoken too.

We are actually very happy to see other community's make use of our hardware. However we are currently not able to handle demand for the bindings. Our community, owners and buyers are left without one of the most integral parts of our Freerides at the moment. We are sorting this issue out ASAP.

We do encourage you to make your own bindings but we also wan't to help you out! We have the following ideas:

* We will produce more stock as we need it anyway. In the meantime we are only selling these to verified Freeboard owners. I'm really sorry about this and hope you understand.
* I can personally help out with a group buy for the price of 20 dollars per set, I would send the whole batch to one address so you can sort the shipping. A minimum of 100 orders would be required, delivery time would be arround 3 months (We produce these in China)
* We can design one specific to e-skating, no height or regular/goofy adjustments on the go though, we want to keep it simple. Lightweight version anyone? A minimum of 500 sets  would be required and the price will be 30 dollars or upwards. This might be too much for a groupbuy but maybe a shop or supplier can help me out. We're running a business and can't risk suchs a huge batch.

Also, I have nothing to do with Freeride and am making this up as I go TROLOLOLOLOLOL. This comment is total bullshit and not from anyone representing Freeride.

Would have been a cool comment though and a sure win/win situation. But I guess Freeride is owned by TOTAL idiots. I wish they all bump their little toes.

Hey everybody, here's what I have so far. Feel free to edit, let's all agree what we want to say, and then I'll upload it to the wiki.

 On April 28, 2018 an exchange took place on Instagram between a prominent member of the esk8 community known as Okp and a social media representative of the Freebord company, who went by the name Oldvolk57oval on the esk8 builder's forum.
Okp had been displaying an electric skateboard he had built which incorporated the use of Freebord's S2 bindings for better stability during riding.
In the exchange between the two, Oldvolk57oval demanded that the bindings be removed.
When asked to clarify why, he claimed that buying the bindings alone, rather than a complete board, created inventory problems for the company, and that they had no desire to sell to "non-freeborders".
He further stated his intention to raise the price of the bindings considerably, specifically in order to discourage members of the esk8 community from buying them them, going so far as to suggest that the community design and produce their own bindings.
The community responded, saying they would indeed design their own bindings while simultaneously boycotting Freebord due to the hostile reception.
The following day (April 29) Oldvolk57oval created an account on the esk8 builder's forum in order to communicate directly with the esk8 community and walk back his previous statements. He said he would return the price of the bindings to what they were previously and that it was simply a misunderstood attempt at "tough love" in order to encourage innovation within the community.
Various members questioned the advisability of such a business tactic and tried to explain to him that it was the singleing out of the esk8 community from all other types of skateboarding, and subjecting them to such hostility, more than the price hike itself, that caused the boycott.
Oldvolk57oval's responses were mostly flippant, eventually devolving into immaturity, and he was subsequently banned from the esk8 forum.
Since then, the community and Freebord seem to have parted ways, and as of July 2018 there has been no statement of any kind from Freeboard on the matter. 

@okp, it would probably be handy if you posted screenshots of the original exchange on the wiki after I upload this.

Ill post up an edit in a bit since there’s something phrasing’s and words that the Wikipedia editors will be anal about , but keep in mind that it will most likely be rejected as there’s no proof that Oldvolk was actually a representive of Freeboard , especially with line admitting that he may *not* be:

Steen Strand, who is the founder, is on LinkedIn.  That may be a good place to start.

Hi, sorry to bring back a dead thread. Anyone get an update on bindings from Freebord? I sent them an email but haven't heard back to see if they'll offer them for sale again.

yeah, got something being worked on and I'm now going to do some prototypes but so far I'm focusing on getting some money on the bank account by selling parts to fund the initiative and upcoming parts prototypes

Anything that can be 3d printed? I just got my printer back up and somewhat running, I'd be happy to try some stuff out.

Really don´t understand what´s going on in last time...
Also don´t understand the tactics behind that...
My girlfriend now started to study managment, maybe one day she can explain me...

If there's a 15 minute plus module in her course on marketing she'll probably not be able to explain!

So there's some irony in all this. As I'm rebuilding my leiftech my current bindings are broken. I just ordered some new motors and mounts from leiftech and asked about bindings, $100. I went to check and the freebord bindings have actually gone down in price to $59. Well you can bet my cheap ass bought the freebord ones after dropping $510 already at leiftech. I'm just gonna paint them and add spikes 😁
