Hey guys,

This is just a general inquiry. Please don't derail into a bash.

I've ordered from APS before and the turn around time has been pretty quick. But my last order(about a month and a week ago)  hasn't seen any traction, or responses from Bruno lately.

Has anyone had issues getting thier parts from them lately?  Just curious. Thanks :)

I’ve never had any issues buying motors from them. 
I suggest sending Bruno a message through the website and email. 
There maybe a stock issue that wasn’t updated on the website when you placed your order.

Thanks Nama. I had an open thread with him via email. Didn't try opening a new contact form, I'll try that.

As far as I know they were during location change and maybe that's the reason.

Cool thanks guys. I was just curious! Not complaining or hatin :).  My previous orders had only taken a couple weeks so just didn't know if anything had changed.

@Namasaki can you close this so it doesn't get derailed in the future.  I've gotten a few PM's about the normal turn around time. So this can be marked as resolved.
