Hey guys. Just came from ESk8 news.

Going to do a TB setup with Dexter's new gear drives. Was going to use those unlockable bolts so I could quickly swap between my 30 and 40 inch deck.

Was gunna go 12S4P . What motors should I use? I've been told 6355s are enough but wanted to see if any of you had builds with 74s or 80s.

Also thinking about it maybe being an AWD. 

Let's talk.
