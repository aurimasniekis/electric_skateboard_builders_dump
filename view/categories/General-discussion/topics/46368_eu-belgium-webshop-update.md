Hey guys

I updated the webshop :slight_smile:
 
www.electricboardsolutions.com/

Some feedback would be great! If you find spelling mistakes or just weird things let me know ;)

I need to add some more products for now I mostly added maytech products. 

I made a 5% discount code for eSK8.builders members: :facepunch:


> esk8.builders

Looks good. Not yet interested in any of the parts so I haven't checked out the ordering process.
Keep adding more products and look into stocking some FOCBOX when available. Seems like there is always demand for them in the EU.

Why did you choose to carry htd 3M pulleys and kits instead of 5m? 

Chances that it'll be a hot seller are pretty slim.

Will you be selling the Maytech HUBS in the future as well?

Hey yes I know 5M would be better, they came standard as 3M from maytech but I'm designing 5M pulleys ;) Stay tuned!

I have a suggestion that perhaps you can add related parts when you view a part.

Site looks good, keep it up.

About the enclosure, I'm not sure you will sell any without giving the inside dimensions. :slight_smile:

Haha yes, that's true ;) but it's a prototype and at the moment it doesnt fit fit anything haha. My printer max dimension are 20x20x20 cm so probably there will not be place for more than 2 x 3slipo packs and a vesc ;)

The website looks very good. Well done. Keep it up! :wink:
For the enclosure you can think about a CR-10, I have it and it prints well (printing board 30x30x40cm). I am going to try ABS for enclosure soon.

ok, sorry for reopening the old thread but I guess I should share my experiences with @e.board_solutions  

I bought Orangatang test pulleys and XCar ESC from frederick last week...the parcel was dispatched really quickly, I had a bit of a problem with wrongly ordered thing...Frederick answered in few minutes and everything was solved quickly :) All came nicely packed, everything seems fine :) Cant w8 to test it on my 2nd esk8 :) 6 stars out of 5 

I just thought it would be nice to share my experience if there was someone wondering, if the shop is ok :)

By far the best eskate parts webshop for EU and specifically netherlands! He speaks dutch so itâ€™s ideal for dutch builders. The shipping is also a big plus because from the US youâ€™ll have 40+ shipping cost.

In total ordered for more than 500 euro's I believe, 
Everything in perfect condition. 
Except for 2 Vesc's, they failed during motor initializing and he solved this problem asap.

Friendly guy, and trustworthy
