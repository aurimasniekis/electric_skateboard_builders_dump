17 days ago my parents and I made an agreement (in writing with signature) that if I had perfect behavior for 17 days I would be able to buy an eboard **with my money**. It's been 17 days and now they changed their mind and think it's "too dangerous" I made another contract that said I would only ride in safe environments with a helmet under 25mph. Can they even do this!? I've wanted an eboard for 2 years and now I have enough money but they won't let me get it! What should I do?!

build one. buy pieces bit by bit and then "happen to have all the pieces to build one!". Like eg my mum didn't let me have a tv in my room. so i bought a set top box, an hdmi switch and a pc monitor "for my laptop" and "oops hey thats cool, I can have a tv in my room now. trust me, they'll never know ;)

I'd love to see this contract (:

But honestly, eboarding can be a v.dangerous activity and your parents are probably just looking out for you.

nothing beats a contract to keep your room tidy for a full 365 days....imagine you present this offer to your mom, I think she would then even come get herself a board and take you out for an esk8 session... :-)

Well they can do that unfortunately, I'd plead with them and kindly ask them if not honering a promise or a contract is something they want to teach you is okay.

In the end they have all the say till you're 18 or you move out.

joking aside: I think having a clear discussion with your parents could help. ask them what exactly they are afraid you'd be doing. Educate them on how to mitigate risks for example full face helmet, proper protection gear etc. Perhaps even discuss with them where you would go for a ride. Do any of your friends have e-boards? maybe borrow it and show it to your folks.
I think most important is to keep your parents' fear at bay and you can contribute to that by explaining everything in detail and also convince them, that safety is also your top priority.
Do you have good bike paths to run an eboard on?

My advice as a parent who has crazy adrenalin junkie kids is to approach it with the safety aspect first.
Show them the gear you want to buy that can save your life.  Show them helmets and pads etc then maybe they will see that you are taking the danger seriously and be more open to allowing the project.  Also don't go building yourself some rocket ship, just stick to a good safe first build that can get you from a to b.

Alright if you wanna know the secret to convincing parents its this

Wait till there drinkin
Then ask them about it
If they say no wait a litte bit
Ask again
If they yes order everything that night
Then wait and wait
Everything will show up and they will either be confused or just not care
Build the board
Enjoy the board
Get addicted 
Build another
And another

Its worked once or twice for me.

Alright then last resort 
Make a PowerPoint 
Include all the pros and cons
Make the cons sound good
Lie about the price
And make them feel guilty when u cant finish it. (Dont do this its a dick move)
Finish the board.

And if this doesnt work tell em your gonna use the money instead to buy drugs and spiral down into a pit of depression and drop out of school.

As a parent to just a 4 year old. I fight myself in what I would "allow" my daughter to do in the future. I would LOVE for her to ride one in a few years, but going very slow and not next to cars. but I fear what would happen with this kind of transportation freedom when she gets older. I would've gotten into all kinds of trouble (regular skateboards took a lot of my study time in high school and college)

Knowing a few people who died from this activity really messes with your head as an adult and parent. It's not the rider's ability that's in question either, sometimes it's the environment around you, If you ride next to where cars drive, one crash in the wrong direction might mean a car hitting you. So parents keeping you away from it is understandable.

At 15, no "contract" is binding as you are really not at a legal age to sign documents anyway. Best to really TALK to your parents, 25mph is actually really fast on something that can have a fault and throw you off. Consider going a bit slower and be FULLY padded to win parents approval.

If you build then it's educational as well and this can lead to future passion for design/CAD work, mechanical/electrical engineering and such. Make this a learning thing instead of a pure riding thing.

Parents love facts... give them examples of activities they mY approve lf thaf are more dangerous, tell them about the safety precautions you will take and honestly, the last resort  would be to call them out on them not honoring their deal. Is that the example they want to set? Does this mean you can back out of commitments with no recourse?

My response to when my dad attempted not letting me go to a Metallica concert when I was 13 was to punch him in the chest. I got to go to the show. But I regret that to this day. Basically what happened was I had never acted in such a way but I was so impassioned that it boiled over. Maybe try to find a less violent way to convey

I'm also 15 and I was in the same situation as you a few months ago. I just finished building [my first board](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/single-belt-drive-torqueboards-6380-10s-60c-5000mah-lipo-battery-charge-only-bms-flipsky-fsesc-4-12-mbs-at-wheels-torqueboards-218-trucks/81125) though. The thing that convinced my parents to let me make one was the **brakes**. Before my longboard was electric, I was regularly bombing hills at over 25 mph and hoping I didn't crash. I actually fell 3 times at high speeds, and have a nasty scar to show for each fall. I was going 25 mph without a motor, so the idea of no extra speed and the addition of brakes was really appealing to my parents. Also, my parents really loved that I was learning from it. They want me to be successful in life as an engineer or entrepreneur so they didn't want to suppress my creativity. I would stress the idea of being able to slow down, and say that the process of making the board is just as fun and important as riding it in the end.

1. -if you need the original contract I can see why they don't want you to have a esk8
2.- you're 17, I think the best way it's to wait till next year 
3. Think like them, they are worried for you health, as someone that almost die I can tell that looking your parents cry while you are at a hospital bed not knowing if you're gonna walk out of that or not its a shitty position, and I've seen more that 1 case of dudes running over esk8s 
4.- part of having something that can go 25mph+ or - it's like they giving you a car, and at 17, with friends, we can do stupid things...... Believe me. 
5.-calm down and think, then talk to them, then showthem this forum and reask if you can have 1 with the facts. 
6.-dont know what you want to study at the degree, if you want to be an engineer, then showthem this forum, and tell them what you want in the future and that this will help you developer yours skills
7.-sorry for the long post

take it from a kid who’s 12, freaking beg. my parents didn’t care what i said i would do, they wanted action. they also needed to know how safe i would be cause i’m a daredevil. i’d been skateboarding for a year before and had proven i could be safe. i also promised i would set the best settings so i couldn’t go faster than 10 mph. (like i actually did that. 🙄)

Ok, so I am 16 now and here is what I did to get my parents to be ok with me esk8ing. I first chose a board and told them about the speed and other things upfront, then when they said no, I thought I would do some math to see how much money I would save if I were to ride my esk8 to school and work, which was a decent amount including insurance and gas. They then said they would think about it. I later went to a local electric vehicle store which had a bunch of e bikes, scooters and the inboard m1. Because my dad used to skateboard I thought he would like it and thus allow me to buy one. He really liked it and was actually interested in getting one for himself to go to work but most pre-built boards don't have the range he needed (this was before I new about DIY and the forum). He ended up buying an ebike and convinced my mom that the esk8 was safe and stable. I wish you luck on your journey :smile:

17 days ago my parents and I made an agreement (in writing with signature) that if I had perfect behavior for 17 days I would be able to buy an eboard **with my money** . It’s been 17 days and now they changed their mind and think it’s “too dangerous” I made another contract that said I would only ride in safe environments with a helmet under 25mph. Can they even do this!? I’ve wanted an eboard for 2 years and now I have enough money but they won’t let me get it! What should I do?!
[/quote]
Alright listen to my advice,
say these
1. Your eboard will only go 25kmh "cough 60kmh"
2. Mum you know no one has died on and eboard " false"
3. it will only cost like 500usd "bullshit like 1000"
4.Mum you know my friend has them and we ride them all the time at like 50kmh " just bullshit your way out"
5. don't tell her all the parts, just say i only need a bms, battery, vesc, motor and a motor mount
6. if they don't work just threaten to kill yourself, works all the time :slightly_smiling_face:
7. only do 6 if you have tried all others
8. just buy the parts
9. its my money mum and i can do what ever i want "true"
10. Mom: you have to save for a car. You: fek you mom im leaving

Here's a painful suggestion that might backfire on you. Your parents will hold onto your remote. So they have the ability to control when you are allowed to ride or not. Just don't cheat them by using a second remote

Sorry to chime in out of nowhere, but just another suggestion. Lots of great suggestions here on the forum as well!

Maybe try scheduling a day where your friends(with eboards), your parents, and you all get together on an afternoon in the park or some other safe location. During the meetup, you could find a good way for your friends to let you "test" their boards in front of your parents, (with their approval, and going slow, taking extra caution, etc.) to make sure they know you're really interested, and that you're ready. One of the biggest things in this appears to be SAFETY, and they're justified. Imagine little Timmy (whom they've taken care of, loved, and protected for years) wants to race along cars on a skateboard at 25 mph. There's obviously going to be a slight concern regarding safety (there's hardly any protection on these things).

Another thing that would be super helpful in this situation would be demonstrating your knowledge of how dangerous this sport can be! One of the FIRST things you should get is a GOOD helmet, and some pads/gloves/guards. Showing your parents that you respect the dangers associated with electric skateboards, and care about your safety is going to make them more likely to let you get one. 

Also, regarding "is this even fair" - yes completely! They're your legal guardians, they have every right to tell you what you can and cannot do (until you become a legal adult). Whether or not you agree with it is a different question...

The fact that you create a contract to 'behave' for 17 days leads me to think that there is a trust problem between you and your parents. You should fix that... and as they trust you more.. the opportunity to get a eskate will increase. 

If not.. move out when you hit 18 and go buy a eskate.

There are trust issues... They signed a contract and after the kid held up his side.. the parents changed their mind. That's 'trust breaking' behavior. Now the OP is making another contract... but he doesn't believe his parents will hold up their side of the deal.. so he's here asking what he can do.

Realistically if they don't budge on their decision you either have to live with it until you can legally claim responsibility over your own life where you can veto your parents decision, or do it anyway. I didn't discover esk8 until I moved out but I'm sure my fam would have had the same thoughts about it if I was in your situation.

Convince your parents that building your own E-board is a learning experience that combines mechanical, software and electrical engineering in one project, on a rather basic level. Show them the end result and you riding it, then have this discussion again. You're 15. I'd be thrilled as a parent if my kid wanted to do something creative instead of swallowing tidepods and playing fortnite...
Shit, I mean, its either that or you starts slinging dope on the corner, you got mad connects from that kid in school.

The real challenge for me reading this is that its the norm for parents to incentivise future activities on the basis of what they consider "good behavior" grinds my gears when parenting is handled this way.

Two kids:

One has been brought up by example and knows the consequences of their actions and understands the difference between right and wrong, mostly making the right decisions but still a kid.

One is a little shitface because they've had a carrot dangled in front of their faces their whole life and they've been taught to act right, not be right.

This is not directed at you @Agrelle, I obviously don't know your situation. I hope your parents aren't doing this but fml its the norm in most western countries.

 Raise good kids people, not kids that know how to act good when it's appropriate.

Sorry for the rant :frowning:

I could make the argument that building and falling is good cuz it teaches what works and what doesn’t. I started with all Chinese parts installed super sketchily, it didnt go over 15mph. I slowly upgraded everything until I had a dual 6384 beast (it got up into the high 30’s low 40’s). I bought full pads tho, body armor, full face, etc.

All I’m saying is that there is definitely something to be said for learning completely independently

dude, do what i did.
At 16 i wanted to build an esk8. So i picked subjects at school accordingly so that i needed a major project. I picked electronics 😉
Basically i gave my parents a run down and said "i need financial assistance in this". and because it was my hsc major they sort of needed to help me lol. 
BUT in your case, you can do the "I'll be building an esk8 for my major. but dont you worry! I'll be paying for all of it!" 
95% chance it'll work.
Also dont be a pest. for you and your parents sake. leave it till they forget about it and then bring it up again. don't be impatient. the more time you have to think about it, the more research you can do and the more knowledgeable you will be. Trust me on this one 😁

If you snowboard... skiers are no different than cars. You are moving, they are moving... but you probably won’t die if you hit one... or they hit you...

Ever consider getting a straight up long board to start with... demonstrate to them that you aren’t worthy of a Darwin award and that you aren’t going to die **_without_** the help of Edison and Tesla... then mod that thing after they get used to that last idea? You can always [McFly your way around for awhile...](https://youtu.be/zZJ7cq6T3v4?t=41) just don’t get caught...

@Agrelle i dont know how old you are or how you saved up for a boosted board but i used to have a good agreement with my parents where **"money i earn is mine"**.

They set me up my own savings account that i had sole access to, this was for money i earn only, gift money didn't count. Things that i brought with this money belonged to me and were not under my parents control. If i saved for a phone or games console it could not be confiscated as punishment because it was mine and i had earned it.

Once i realized this I had both incentive to save money and an appreciation for its worth. This quickly encouraged me to get a paper round and then a weekend job. 
looking back this was a great idea from them. It taught me to respect my possessions and also to be financially responsible. honestly i made some great purchases and also brought a few things that turned out to be a waste of money but i guess that's part of the learning process.

It might seem like stating again from the beginning but maybe you could convince your parents to enter a similar agreement. earning money is different to saving money. if you can earn enough for a boosted it shows that your committed to the idea, you understand its worth and your likely to look after it. its cost your parents nothing and if it doesn't work out then you've learnt a life lesson.

 . . . if all that fails then pretend your interested in getting a motorbike, suddenly eskate doesn't sound so bad :smile:

Building an ESK8 (especially if you design some parts yourself) teaches you 100X more than any course you’ll take in highschool.

false, come on. we’re always gonna walk down to the ice cream store and find out how many combinations we could have or figure out the area of curved shapes by integrals.

if i didn’t use the integrals part right, sry i’m learning.

You could make an agreement that you won't drive on roads, what about that?

Once you make a board that goes that speed, you want more.
mine goes 37mph or 60kmh and im 16, i haven't even got protective gear on btw and i still want more

I'm gonna disagree with the other comments here. I'm 17, started my build at 15. You really don't *need* an electric skateboard, at least not to the degree you feel like you do. Honestly, a bike is a better mode of transportation (shorter braking distance, more reliable, easier to lock up so you don't have to go stash it somewhere), if a little less fun. If it's that important to you you can keep fighting them on it but ultimately parents are parents and the fact is they have the ability to make and enforce decisions unilaterally. Good luck though! :grin:

I think your parents are probably just really worried about you getting hurt. I have skates for several year now so has a lot of people here and most of use have fallen some have even died who were very experienced. I think you would win them over if you showed them the protective gear you were looking at in order to be safe on it. If you look up a few pictures of @Deckoz in full armor and show that to them they may change there mind or just introduce your mom to @Grozniy because he is like a snake charmer

I completely agree with @faithfulpuppy. He said what I was thinking better than I could write it out. The electric skateboard is a want. They are fun, but it isn't worth introducing family issues to have one. Wait for college and have a blast there with it! Practice with the friends for the present if plainly they don't allow it or, as it seems, are unsure of the safety. I've already been almost twice already myself in a short space of time, and that's being careful in residential areas.

This is not true.  (Im kidding) 

But in all honesty for some people an electric skateboard is the best choice

for example Im almost 14 (Turn 15 Jan 31 ) and live in a medium sized town that you probably never heard of, **_Hershey_**. I use my electric skateboard to get everywhere being its the quickest and most efficient since I cant drive and everything I do is within 5 miles with some exception. Also during the summer we get a ton of traffic in our small town making esk8ing a quick and easy way to get by that. I also use eskating as both a hobby and as a true means of transportation the only time I have to hang it up is during the winter, but even then thats when I improve my board. 

**Back to the topic**, look at it this way @Agrelle you have to decide hobby or way of transportion, how long will you actually use it, how much money, and what board are you gonna build. let your parents know what you are using it for and tell them know you get its dangerous and you understand the risk. if they so no then wait.

Oh of course, but a bike does that too! A little slower, more work to ride, but also less than half the price and easier to deal with. 

I started kinda dreaming of having an electric skateboard when I realized how hilly some of the colleges I'd be considering are, but I guess I played myself because the one I'm gonna be going to is almost totally flat, so I'm gonna get around on my normal cruiser. After all this hassle, the eboard is probably gonna get hung up (outside of group rides, ofc.)

What I'm saying is: you're not missing out on much (except wicked fun) if you already have a bike.

also the only problem Ive had with Ebikes and normal bikes is theres not many places to lock a bike around me.

I build my first board during my freshman year of high school, and now dozens of boards later I'm in college ;) I second the science fair idea if all else fails, I wanted to back Boosted Boards on Kickstarter but my parents wouldn't let me... so I got an electric skateboard concept approved as a science fair idea before telling my parents, and after that I was locked in! :joy:
