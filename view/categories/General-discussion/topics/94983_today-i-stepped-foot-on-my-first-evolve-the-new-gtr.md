Went on a group ride today and i got to try out one (two) of those evolve GTR‚Äôs... so very first step i ask if it is sensored. I got told to kill the battery if i can. I hit the throttle and 2 feet After, the board disconnects, tosses me off gently and begins to smoke from the usb port ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è  My very first experience on an evolve was off to a great start. I felt really bad but instead of being upset they just gave me another gtr to try out. After riding it around a bit successfully this time,
I have to say... Not a bad board! I really like the carbon fiber deck. The power is definitely lacking compared to my diy but it would have been awesome to have as my first board. I really liked the control but HATED the trucks. They were so fidgety and they acted squirly while accelerating. I get the turning ability is vastly improved but i like going fast...im still curious as to what happened to the first board.

This was an action packed group ride. Someone experienced why diyeboards trucks are shit first hand. That guys wheel caused another rider to bail as well. Shout out to @Arzamenable!!! Great dude with some great Esk8 knowledge!

how did it feel power wise? i know they use some pretty small motors. did they get hot? or do they have thermal monitoring

They have monitoring. Good power but again, i set my board to be pretty powerful.motors seemed fine. We were riding on grass to test them. I never touched the motors tho

We can loop around Black's Beach ;)

When I was coming up the paved portion of the bluffs, some dudes were doing some killer non electric down hilling with pucks. One dude crashed straight into a guard rail. Definitely want to push my board to the limit going up that steep shit.

I also rode a bamboo GTR yesterday with an AT kit on, here are my thoughts

1. It‚Äôs really high off the ground
2. It‚Äôs slow
3. The brakes are poor and the brake control does nothing for 80% of its travel
4. It‚Äôs meh

I also rode a Backfire ranger which I thought was so much better

The Park Ranger is better!?

So if I offered you a choice between a backfire and an evolve, you would take the backfire?

@Mikenopolis, you‚Äôve ridden both, right? I think the GTR would be a great buddy board, albeit an expensive one.

Ouch. What trucks are those and was the rider injured? The axle looks like crappy pot metal.

@Bobby I get a kick out recognizing fellow forum riders in real life solely by recognizing their board. üòÇ

It‚Äôs gift I have. I guess I‚Äôm on esk8 autism spectrum.

Ahh hell no. If the comparison is the backfire vs evolve AT. I‚Äôll take the Evolve if price wasn‚Äôt the issue. Use it for a year or two then swap things out. The Ranger would go into the trash after that long. Don‚Äôt get me wrong. I like the Ranger, but‚Äôs it‚Äôs boring.  heavy large hub motor with thin rubber means the hub cover plate gets banged up quick.

Absolutely the backfire all day.  The DKP trucks are so much nicer than the evolve, much more confidence inspriring.  The board is super smooth and quiet, the quietest board I have ever (not) heard.  I just loved it, everything about it was great.

Opinions are like arseholes, we all have one.  I have bearly ridden either board and cant account for durability, but from a stand on this board and ride it for 5 mins I think the backfire is a nicer board

Quietness is FOC vs BLDC or belt vs hub. Heavy people like myself generally like belts. The biggest problem with the Ranger is the deck being on the thin side. I‚Äôm getting that fixed by Tim/Sender

I think both boards run FOC no? And yes the backfire being hubs is probably why its so damn quiet and smooth.  Its a good inch lower ride hight than the evolve, I much prefer the trucks too, I normally hate DKP but loved the ranger.  The evolve didnt wow me like a "premium" board should.  Neither board is a true AT board, they dont gave enough power, but for cutting about the shitty streets of London I choose ranger.  Luckily I dont have to choose either as I have a trampa, but still.

The way DIY people sees it, evolve is basically $1,000 too much and Ranger is probably worth $600 (that‚Äôs with profit). Neither of them would be ‚Äúpremium‚Äù by our standards. Style wise I love the Carbon because to the streamlined look. I wish the Ranger didn‚Äôt have a split enclosure, flexible battery and less deck flex.
