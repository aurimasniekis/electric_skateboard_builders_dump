Did he give you permission to post them? I don't know if he wants to show them to the public just yet

Would the 33" deck have an option for someone like me to use his own 12s3p battery and two tb 12s esc's?

@i2oadsweepei2 Yeah, you could. The deck is listed by itself as well on our website. I'm not sure if the cut out will fit but it might. You can email me and do some measurements to let you know if it's a direct fit.

The enclosure is 600mm long.

the 33" deck looks really cool, also accommodating 26650 cells with the enclosure, nice job :smile_cat:

Ya its a good time to measure. I'm putting those parts in now. I'm at 24" 609mm LoL and I can shave a bit by moving things a bit closer. That left 1/4" on the front end of the battery too. So basically perfect. I can lose an inch easily. 

I would want everything less battery, charger, remote and receiver. Maybe more drop down menus? 

Anyway congrats.

I see you have the motors and hubs on, Is there anyway we could get a pic with the battery pack inside? Would like to see how it all pairs with the hole in the deck.
