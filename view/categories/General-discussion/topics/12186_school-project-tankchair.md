Hello, my name is Michael. I go to computer and electronics school.
I have a school project i'm going to build with a friend in my class.
My school pays for the project, but we have a budget at around 550 dollars.

We are going to build a tankchair, similar to this.

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/9/8/9858cbc13a0ef534e1c2569d59fec2657606397c.jpg" width="690" height="345">

Personally, i have a lot of electronics experience. My grandfather has a workshop and he has teached me a lot.
I have built an RC tank and a quadcopter before. My friend knows a lot about cars and how they work and he can also weld.

Now for the questions. I was thinking of using Turnigy Aerodrive 6374 on 12S.
I had to find a 12S ESC. I will be using two motors, one per track. I will be gearing the motors a lot,
i am going for torque not speed.
After a lot of research, i found this ESC: http://www.wheelspinmodels.co.uk/i/85118/

But when i looked through the forum, i found out that using a VESC was the best option, one of the reasons are
that normal ESC's have a chance of smoking. I have read that normal ESC's are not made for a vehicle you can stand on.

I found this ESC: diy-electric-skateboard-kits-parts/vesc-the-best-electric-skateboard-esc/

I am thinking of ordering that instead, it supports 12S and 240 Amps burst.

The problem is that i want tank steering. I will control the tank with
one stick from my radio. When i move the stick forward i want both motors to move forward,
when i move stick to the left i want one motor to spin forward and one backwards.
And i don't want any brakes. I want the motors to move from forward to backwards throttle without any braking.
I know the ESC is programmable, but i just want to be sure.

Maybe someone has a suggestion for a better ESC. It can't be too expensive though, i have almost blown the budget!

Any help? Thanks.

im not sure how you will realise it with this budget, but good luck ;)
if you want to go 12s with high output, you´ll need two 12s escs, also i would pay attention on getting sensored escs, because you´ll need to move the motors from a standstill.

What you linked is a VESC from DIY and it´s only 50A continuos.
With 2 of these you´ll be able to generate about 4,4 kW with 2 motors.

That budget is for the electronics only. 
Our school supplies us with everything else we need so i 
think it's possible.

What ESC do you recommend then?
The motors pull 70 amps on max.
Yes i know i need one ESC per motor.

The problem is just finding an ESC that i can use,
i researched a lot to find those ESC's.

Widely used are these: diy-electric-skateboard-kits-parts/torqueboards-12s-120a-car-esc-opto-hv/,
Also tested and used in some applications like Mountainboards are the "Robbe Roxxy Blcontrol 9100-12 Opto"

Have you considered brushed motors? You would get a slower speed and constant torque. Plus they are eaiser to controls. Brushed motors run hotter but cost a lot less than brushless.

My friend found some brushed scooter motors, but i'm not sure if i can connect them to the receiver. I want to control the tank with my radio.

It says it comes with a speed controller. So you could use that and since you dont care about weight you could maybe use lead acid for price.

Yeah, but the problem is, how can i control it with my receiver? I must also be able to reverse motor direction.
It also comes with pedals.

Because then i can't reverse direction of the motors, and it's easier to control with one stick instead of two pedals.

That means i need one switch per motor.

If you decide to go the Vesc + BLDC Motor route, you can implement the steering by adding an Arduino between the remote receiver and the vesc's remote inputs, as an arduino can read the receivers output, calculate the needed output accordingly (if throttle = 0 and steer = max left -> left Vesc 0 and right vesc 100) and then sending two outputs for the two vescs. The needed programming would be minimal, but you can completely customize the behaviour (like maybe make steering not as powerful the faster you go to prevent accidents, idk) and you could even expand on it (you can hook up sensors to the arduino or add a screen, or even hook up both vescs uart so you get realtime information to display on a screen)

Think you need a channel mixer and ask the site if they have joystick control which I think they do I'm too lazy to look for it

I want to control it with one stick. I when i move the stick forward, both motors go forward, when i move it to the side one motor must go in the other direction so the tank will rotate/spin 360 degrees. I have made a mini rc tank before that works perfectly like this.

Weight is a bit of a problem. I want to save any weight i can. We started making the tank tracks today and they are really heavy. We know the vehicle will be heavy so we are trying to save what weight we can. Thinking about two 6S lipos. Also, the 1000w brushed motor is more expensive then the 2250 watt brushless, and i will gear down the motor anyway, is there even a point in getting brushed then?

If you are controlling it with rc radio, (mine is a Taranis) what you are looking for is differential thrust.   You'll definitely need 2 ESCs.

Yes, as i said i have already made this in a smaller scale.
Here is a video. One stick controls the gun, the other controls the two motors.
I have two ESC's too, i want to do the same thing now.
I have a taranis too.

VESC seems like a good option to me, and you should be able to reverse with the `control mode` set to `current`.

No thanks. 12 volts is too low for what i'm making now and the motors reminds me of a drill motor.

Why is it better to use brushed motors?
```

---
## \#36 Posted by: TarzanHBK Posted at: 2016-11-02T21:19:48.609Z Reads: 53

because they provide full torque from start on.
Brushless needs to spin faster to reach their perfect momentum

Hmm i have never heard that before. 
But i still can't find any brushed motors that are as powerful as the brushless sk3 at the same price. The brushed motors i linked are apparently more expensive with shipping and toll.

Ok, i'm really insecure about what motor to buy. Either a brushed or a brushless.
Our school is waiting for us to decide. The big turnigy SK3 or the ebay brushed motor.

I want brushless because i have experience with brushless, and i want too have a look at them
because i want to build an e-skateboard later.

It looks like the brushless motors provide lots of torque from the start. 
Does it make so much of a difference? 
The brushless motors are also over 2000 watt but the brushed are only 1000.
Also, why use brushless on skateboard, but use brushed on this?

But in the end, it all comes down to what works best.

What should we do?

No, he can't.
Laptop batteries are low-C ( aka can supply only low currents ), old ones are gonna be even worse!
And you need ESC for brushed as well if you want to control the speed...

I have an update. We went with the brushless motors and two 6s lipos.

We have started making the tracks. Here is a picture of one of them:

We tried pulling as hard as we could in each end but nothing happened. 
I really think it's going to hold. 

But still i think i still want to add two more screws, not for making it stronger,
but for making the connection less loose.
