Hi guys,

Three years ago I built my own electric longboard with a **"Loaded Vanguard" desk**. After many hardware upgrades, the desk **looks very bad** on the downside. I don´t want to buy a new desk, because they´re so expensive. 

I thought I could **grind** the wood a little bit and **oil it**. Does anyone has experience with my problem or any suggestions?

Is it even possible to do this? Because I think the Loaded desk has a kind of **fiberglass** inside...


Thank you,

Jkobi :grin:

Decks. You wrote desk, which is a very,very different thing. I ride a desk all day at work, trust me, its not as fun as riding a deck.

My desk is pretty beaten up as well, i got rid of it and build a new workbench with cheap lumber. 

On a side note, i had no idea loaded made furniture. Anyone want a group buy on a loaded nightstand?

Sand it down and remove the previous clear coat, and then spray a new coat over it after sanding it to about 300~400 grit
