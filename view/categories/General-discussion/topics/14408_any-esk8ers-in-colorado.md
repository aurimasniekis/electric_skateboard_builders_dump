Just curios if there's any one here who live in colorado. Would like to get together with some guys that are into the hobby. Go for rides and such. I'm located in Colorado Springs.

I'm in Aurora. However I'm dead right now as my daily shit on me and snapped a truck. In the process of receiving parts to complete a new daily. I'm always up for a ride though.
