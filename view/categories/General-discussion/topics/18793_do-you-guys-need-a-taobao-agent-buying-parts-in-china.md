#Hi guys

If you read my presentation, you know that I work and live in China as an engineer.
And after 1 year here, I met some people who want to start an online buisness. 

One of my close friends is opening an online store on AliExpress, selling all sorts of "electronic stuff for grown up children" (I could say "toys for adults" but people look at me weird when I say that).

- Drones
- RC cars
- Motors
- E-Skateboard parts

But before the buisness starts, she would like to make some cash by beeing a Taobao agent : 
-->     Helping foreigners to buy on Taobao (biggest Chinese online marketplace) and to ship outside china. In exchange for a percentage of the order price of course.

#If you're interested, Reply or PM me ! 
- 1) Find what you wanna buy
--- Go on Taobao (www.taobao.com), find what you want 
OR
--- Tell her what you wanna buy, and she can search for you
- 2) Ask questions about the product, get a translated description
- 3) get a Quote for the total order (Product price + Shipping to her + Shipping to your country + her commission)
- 4) get the product

About after sales : she is a pretty dedicated person so she'll help you resolve conflicts with Taobao sellers, but if they're too stubborn, there is nothing she can do about it, except leaving a bad comment on Taobao, and you leaving a bad review on this forum... Sorry. 

PS: I know her for a long time, she is serious and honest. She's been helping me with some tough sellers, and got me several discounts on DJI Drones, so I fully recommend her.

If you could link the products you would be selling that would make it a little easier. 

I think I've seen a bamboo deck that looked very similar the Boosteds deck, I might be interested in one of those.

Woah, lotsa teplies here !

@Norco I'll update the description, but basically like Okami, you can research what you want on TaoBao, or she can help you search, then she'll tell you the price to ship the item to your country, and take a percentage of the total.
@Okami Nice that you made your research, i'll talk to her today. I hope you're not in a hurry, she still has a day job so she can only work for you guys at night (China time).
 @laurnts Yeah, I quit saying that.

Good, I like smaller boards. I'm 173cm/5Â´8" tall, 65kg/143lbs and currently using a 80cm/31.5inches board. And  that's with a 15cm/6inch tail.

Big fan of your build by the way! Looks neat :slight_smile:

[quote="benwong, post:26, topic:18793"]
replace PLA casing
[/quote]

Have you thought about just adding bondo, do some sanding to your current casing and then paint it instead? That's what I'm planning. Or why would you rather use kydex?

Did it for the helmet I have on my profile pic, came out rather nice!

## \#28 Posted by: benwong Posted at: 2017-03-15T08:28:48.501Z Reads: 159

i have same idea also. i will take out casing, sanding and add carbon wrap on the casing. Just in case i fail. Backup plan is kydex, because kydex feel not so bulky. so that i can lower my deck to drop through with low profit riding. more stable. 
Just kydex process quite hard for me, need supporting tools to do. (foam and clamp and some wood stick to press).

I am doing a similar phase two too you! I am getting a new li ion battery pack with switch and stuff. Then getting a new case. As good as lipos are I do not want to take the batteries out every time to charge them

Yeah, I'm not a big fan of lipos either. Used 4 of them for a summer and they all got a little puffy. And of course the charging was a hassle too. 

Are you going to use a BMS with a one plug charging solution?
```

## \#31 Posted by: kptheinventor Posted at: 2017-03-16T02:24:51.131Z Reads: 151

Yeah will be using a BMS and plug and play charging. Just such a hassle without that. Also harder to get/ make an enclosure if you have to think about taking the lipos out to charge.

Hello guys,
Before send you a quotation, I need to know your address to count the postage (PM me).
I asked the seller for discount for boosted board,  there is not enough orders to get a discount yet. So it will be the same price as taobao.
I can ask the seller about the discount of motor mount, I will get back to you later on this.

My commission will be 15% of total order (price of product + postage), you might have to pay import duties when the package arrived your country.

Same for the mounts @Okami @OskarCastrone

Hey, I recently checked out builds by @will_manners and @Baz_L, both of whom relied heavily upon taobao parts to build their eboards.  I'm thinking of doing the same, and currently have a pretty decent (I think) order put together.  Would be interested in  perhaps going through your friend to buy these parts.  LMK whats up, and I'd love to work something out
