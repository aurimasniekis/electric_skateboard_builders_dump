Hello Everyone, As you can tell I am new here. I'm sure you've been plagued with first build topics, but I've done about as much reading as I can handle and have a pretty clear idea of what i want. 

I have an existing board that I made a few years ago that I will be motorizing, so that's taken care of.

These are the parts that I've decided on (mostly). 

Motor - Turnigy sk3 190kv http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/__18181__Turnigy_Aerodrive_SK3_6364_190kv_Brushless_Outrunner_Motor.html

ESC - VESC (Dont know how to program etc.)

Batteries - Two 5000mah 3s batteries (can I do another?) http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/__8587__ZIPPY_Flightmax_5000mAh_3S1P_30C.html

Controller - Traxxas tq (left over from traxxas car)

Motor mount - Homemade 

Gears & Belt - diy-electric-skateboard-kits-parts/36t-abec-drive-pulley-belt-combo-kit/

Are there any recommendations or changes you would make? 

Thanks a lot!

190kv and 6s will be very slow. I would suggest 245kv for 6s or 10s for 190kv

What's the best 10s configuration for this set up?

10s for 190kv

@mitchell898 2 5s lipo if you are going cheap. 190kv-200kv motor with vesc.

Ok, that's probably what I'll end up going with. A few more questions...

Will 2 4000mah batteries be sufficient?

Will I need other connectors for any of the electrical connections? (Vesc, receiver, batteries)

2 5s lipos in series (with a series connector) at 4000mah will give you about 150 watt hours, you may get 10-15 miles range with this
you'll probably need bullet connectors for the vesc
I think you'll need an anti spark xt90 or some way to turn off the system, though i haven't done this myself so someone else will fill you in there

I would definately be happy 10-15 miles. 

I think my biggest hurdle will be building the motor mount and mounting it to the trucks so that the belt is aligned. I guess we'll see...

Thanks for all the help guys!

Any other recommendations would be awesome.
