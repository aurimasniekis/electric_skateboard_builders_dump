I saw this video https://youtu.be/X-L88hga3Mo?t=356

And thought, maybe for long rides you could build a small trailer (maybe pennyboard size) to hook onto your longboard?

I made a small mockup;

Would you ride this or is this an insanely stupid idea?

With the added friction from the extra set of wheels, along with your board now having to accommodate a towing capacity, you're much better off simply carrying them in a backpack. Maybe to account for the added weight, use a backpack with a waist strap.

just plain stupid. just make a swappable battery and you are done.

I dont think its _stupid_ 

IT does have very minimal practical use though.  I would only utilize this for the day I decide to break the world record on a single charge.

You can only ride for as long as the people with you. I suppose a ride long enough to involve a trailer battery would probably just bore me üòÑ

not sure why the trailer here's necessary, just put it in the center of the deck in between your feet...

similar to bara's extended backpack battery, i made a small extended pack in a pelican 1200 that i can parallel to any of my boards.  i can just set it in the center of the deck and you've got instant +560wh boost.

I feel like it would be a haste to go over bumps and the added cost of the other board 4 more wheels and some kind of connecting solution is just not practical.

My reason to use a setup like this would be;
Esk8 only for day to day commuting, and the trailer for long runs to visit places out of town (a friend or parents). This way the aesthetics of the board wont be ruined by a pelican case between your feet.

Just no. 
Put the extra battery in a backpack and rig up an extension.

(Not trying to be mean, but just no)

I tried this and I can tell you a few things by looking at this

First, the trailer has too many wheels and will instantly wipe-out.  It can only have back wheels.  Also, use steel bushings in that truck LoL.

Second, you have to put the battery *under* the deck or it will immediately flip over unless your hinge mechanism prevents that, in which case it's jerking and pulling your back truck and trying to wipe-out the front board.

So you have to use huge wheels and the center of mass needs to be under the wheel axle.  And only use two wheels in the back that don't steer.

The trailer I made, I took apart again because it wasn't practical.

Just be careful carrying battery packs and mobbing. If u fall on ur extra pack it's bad news

Really,  That sounds like such a restrictive ride be careful you do not Jack knife when carving....just buy a bigger deck and put more below.

@barajabali, your own backpack battery is a smarter idea at that. What happened to that project anyways? :yum: 

Cheers Bro. :grinning::metal:

This is it minus the power supply. I turned that into its own project which connects to the backpack I ended up buying a new backpack so it wouldn‚Äôt have the huge hole in it.

Wow. What's the weight on that? 
How's it feel wearing it on a long run? 
Range on what setup?

![image|488x500](upload://2mJ4qtY9YOf6esgKzkCbeN6bN7P.jpeg) It‚Äôs actually super light. Feels about the same as when I carry around my 7 amp charger and tool bag. It‚Äôs aboit 14 lbs or so. 12s9p
It connects to all of my boards but mostly, 
I use it on my 4wd direct drive trampa which has about a 400wh battery on board giving me 10 miles with the board alone. Coupled with this 1.2kwh pack I get about 30 miles with 4wd :)

Or get a backpack with batteries with a quick disconnect connection in case you fall off.  It‚Äôs added weight on your back but it would probably be way more convenient than a trailer.

![pack|666x500](upload://qJjowvIhCMEHl8oqMFN9ppUZ09W.jpeg) 


This has a 10S2P 26650 12Ah 444Wh pack with  a 15A CCCV charging system and can charge the board main battery pack on the run . On my AT wheels it extends range by about 35km .

Will do a build post if any interest

Yes we all like juicy build pics. Specially involving batteries. :pray: :grin:

Does this charge while you ride, through the bms?

I want one badly. This thing appeals to my inner kid. How come nobody here has done it before? It makes AT wheels legit AF. 

Imagine riding a freakin' mini Hummer! :sunglasses:
