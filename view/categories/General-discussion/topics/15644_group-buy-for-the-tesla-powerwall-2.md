Tesla just started in mega factory to produce the 2170 cells!!
Maybe it's worth to do a group buy for a powerwall 2 :joy::joy:

I haven't seen enough info on the cells. don't know if they will have high enough discharge rate to be used on esk8.

that and i'm hoping tesla energy will sell the cells directly since they are now the largest single producer...

I have a line on the new sanyo cells but they are expensive! I think they will retail for $12 per cell and they are only rated to 4250mAh 12A. Might be better to wait for the new form factor to mature a little before jumping in.
