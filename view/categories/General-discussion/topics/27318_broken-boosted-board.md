Hi,

I have a Boosted Board that had an issue with the battery, someone suggest me to tear down the board and put a new battery I success to dissassembly the board but it seems that the BMS not working anymore (Not sure) I can try to put new cells 12s1p for around 350 euros but I don't want to take the risk if the BMS is broken. So I don't know if someone can help me out or give me advice.
There is a possibility to know if my BMS still working ?
Or if it is possible to keep the original remote original charger and put an VESC with new battery pack ?
I apologize if my English is not good I live in Europe.

I think it will be hard unless u don't mind voiding your warranty but rn I recommend sending it back to boosted for repair

I already voiding my warranty because the board is dissamble right now, if you want to know the full story I did ask boosted board for a repair but they told me that the board was not suppose to Europe market so it will cost me 600 dollars for battery plus shipping.

Ok, tell us the whole story how did the battery died., can you charge it? 
where are you from?
Do you have multi meter to measure the voltage of the battery?

I'm from France the whole story is that the board was working before but can do only 2 kilometers after that the board was stock for month and then when I try to use it again the battery did not work anymore but the led from the BMS was still working,someone suggest me to dissassemble the battery but boosted put a lot of glue and it was really hard to do if you don't want to break the original cover.
But after pull out the battery from the board the BMS did not working maybe because the cells are disconnect and when I put a charger on the bms there is not lights so don't really know if the BMS still working.
But I think the ESC is working the board is pretty new that's why I want to keep it.
I have a multi meter.
I will post some photo of the board maybe it help

Measure it once more to make sure, if it is same it looks like you have 6 dead cells...its kinda weird that they are all on the same side, my personal opinion is, that you will have to replace whole battery pack...but I am not experienced with BMS and batteries, maybe somone more experienced will help you :)

Also if the BMS is dead do you think I can still use the same remote and ESC - Motor and take another BMS.
I have many electric boards (not DIY)  but if I can make an DIY Boosted board it will be great

Yes, you can for sure keep your ESC if you will use the same voltage...
10S LiPo or LiIon should be ok (used for external battery packs)...

I would swap the BMS, new BMS costs like 30$ if you buy small one just for charging :)

Even without working batteries, connecting the charger should produce a warning light of some sort

Original remote will require a bit of work considering it is a properties Bluetooth remote. Might be easier to put in a Bluetooth Arduino setup to communicate

You are definitely checking the voltage incorrectly unless something shorted between cells, which I highly doubt. Check voltage across B+ and B- on the BMS.

I don't have any warning I think my BMS is fucked up

Also I did check the voltage across B+ and B- and it show 0 volt.

Actually I don't really know what to do with the board hope I will find a way to fix it and keep the original ESC

But it's good to know that there is more than one solution

If the BMS does not work, the ESC will not either. They have to have a communication between them for the ESC to function. 

0V is not normal. There should be some voltage between those two points. Try measuring each individual cell by putting one probe on ground B- and then on each cell + pad(C1, C2 etc)

Hi, I saw your post and had an Idea, maybe you can buy a Extended Battery Pack from Boosted, if you can't, buy a battery pack from a local (EU) esk8 shop, I now that Alien sells packs with Bms, but do not know if their pack have a good BMS.

So if I can't make my BMS working the esc will be also fucked up, and if barajabali can't do overseas I have no choice to do it myself or find battery pack with bms + 2 vesc ?

I will try to measuring each cell again don't have my multi meter right now but I will do it ASAP.

Also I see that @raphaelchang have done an internship in Boosted Board and have done is own ESC and BMS do you think he can help me ?

Hey mate. I have a idea I saw this same thing happen to Casey. What he did was get his mate to drive is car around with a rope and him on the board for about half an hour. I think it used the regen braking to recharge the cells and it seemed to work again. You could try this but no guarantee. Worth a try thoüôÇ

Nope, you cannot connect a V2 battery to a V1 ESC. They are not compatible.

Well as far as i know boosted board has the BMS and ESC as separate units... meaning that they dont "talk" to each other so you should be fine changing the batteries with another BMS... BMS is not expensive at all copared to batteries..

BTW are you masuring at the batteries directly or on some cable coming from them? because if on cable it might have just disconnected somewhere due to vibrations and so on

There is communication between the two. There are both power connections and data connections between the two. Check out a tear down video. Fairly easy to spot. I should have a tear down video coming soon as well.

When you plug in a working charger, the BMS should turn on. Sounds like a damaged BMS. I currently have a board with an apparently damaged BMS. I will open it up in to check it out but I am pretty sure that is the easiest way to check if the BMS still functions.

I am planning on just removing the electronics and maybe replace the motor and just put DIY components in mine. You might be able to do the same. You will need a new battery pack either way.

Try soldering them together again :) and the isolate them so they wont short :) 
If you measure 8.46V, how can 6 cells be 1.1V?! It would be 6.6V together...Something is wrong :/ Try again :)

I used heat to pry the bottom lid enough to get my multimeter probes in to make sure the cells were dead. Literally 0V. That's when I got the hammer out. 

Prying from the top pointed edge with my hammer gave me enough leverage to just get the entire battery out.

```
didn't read everything, but these A123 are very tough. I have a 12s2p pack, that I managed to drain to about 1.5v (for the whole 12s). Hobby chargers wouldn't touch it. :( but I read multiple accounts of people reviving these cells. My pack is built so I can split into 6s1p subpacks.

I connected a 6s1p section to a lab PSU, about 18v current limited at 0.5a. 18v/12 = 3v. Kept an eye on the voltage and temperature, let it come up to 18v, took a few hours. repeated for all 4 subpacks. They more or less held near 18v after taking them off. Put them on the hobby charger, and voila, back in business, maybe lost 10-15% of their capacity but they're running great.

sooo, if the cells have not been previously badly abused and have not vented or anything like that, I think if you get about 2.5v at each cell, the BMS may decide it's safe to charge again.

You could maybe get a psu and put about 30v at 0.5a at b+ and b-, perhaps desoldering the BMS connection first. it'll take many hours to come up to 30v. If you're worried the cells have been damaged, it'll be good to check voltage at each cell fairly often at first. Unbalanced series charging with some toasted cells mixed in can be dangerous even with A123.

If the BMS is broken and draining the cells down, you still have a shot at salvaging the cells.

Dude just give it a go it could save you heaps of money. All you need to do is connect a 30v-32v power supply to the battery leads and your done maybe just cut off or desolder the negative lead going the the bms. That's it you could possibly save these cells
```

## \#54 Posted by: deucesdown Posted at: 2017-07-28T22:04:57.379Z Reads: 147

It's not complicated. Get something like this:

http://www.ebay.com/itm/Lab-DC-Variable-Power-Supply-Precision-Digital-5A-30V-DC-Adjustable-PSU-110V-/282430250339?epid=899576533&hash=item41c2279d63:g:PuYAAOSww3tY7aYl

follow instructions to make sure you're in current limiting mode at around 30v (usually this involves turning knobs to minimum, shorting the leads, then raising the knobs slowly). set the current limit low, like 0.5A. This is for safety, so nothing happens too quickly.

Hook it up to the pack where you can watch it. When you hook it up the voltage will drop to close to zero, and current will be at what you set. Voltage will come up very slowly over many hours. If you have the case ripped off, check cell voltages from time to time to make sure they're not too far apart. A small spread should be fixable by the BMS. A large spread, like 1v, stop and come up with a new plan. Also make sure things are not getting hot.

Once the voltage hits whatever you had set it to (the current should start dropping at this point), remove PSU, hook up bms and see if it'll charge.

One of the good things about A123, it's very unlikely to actually shoot flames. Maybe just some poison gas. :slight_smile:

1. you will have to change BMS, remote, reciever and ESC, because the boosted bms and esc are connected somehow...
2. You can use 18650 cells, if the 26650 A123 cookies are not working...

The ebay seller has good history but claims the board came out of a storage locker sale.  Seems a bit suspicious but I have no reason not to believe its the truth.  
  Is there a password to connect with the app?  Once I connect I‚Äôll get some info and so will boosted.  IDK if they do but they could track stolen boards through the app when any one connects to it.

If you bought the whole board you can replace the cells by assembling and spot welding a new pack. If the bms was not damaged you won't have an issue. Make sure to replace with the exact cells. Should be the B variant of the 26mm A123 cells.

12cells is 60$ tops
[/quote]

So you are able to find 12 genuine 20700A cells for under $60?

@Detonatedfrost

To get some replacement cells will cost about $120.

Not a bad deal at all over on [eBay](https://www.ebay.com/itm/A123-Systems-ANR26650M1B-High-Power-Lithium-Ion-Cells-New-With-specs-12ea/222711588863?epid=2255354793&hash=item33daa527ff:g:EVYAAOSwHHFY93PC)

Board $305
Remote $100
Charger $79
Shipping $50
Total $534
Board works great. Put a few miles on it tonight.   I lucked out and batteries are fine..  Its an early V1 with an orange light instead of green..  They changed to green early on because it was confusing people.

You definitely can replace the hardware but the remote may be a bit too difficult for what it is worth, maybe a clone with standard receiver would be a better option. Anyway, here is a thread you might want to check out

Just out of interest...do you have link to BB remote clone ? :) It is quite nice remote, I would consider it for my 2nd board :)

The link that baxter posted above is a clone. 
https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/simple-3d-printed-nrf-remote-arduino-controlled/28543 

It uses arduino so it may involve some tinkering to setup but it has a display which could maybe be adjusted to display whatever you want which is pretty cool... :D

Yea, i know :) I just meant if you know about chineese clones, since there are some chineese boards with similar remote :) I dont have anything against the arduino based :) I might try that just as a challenge :)

Predator uses the same one :) Maybe @PredatorBoards could tell us where to get it :D But its probably secret, am I right? :D

EDIT: They are bought from Winboard :) Still I am interested if it were possbile to buy just a piece somewhere :)

they don‚Äôt have independent receivers. the receivers are soldered on to the custom escs.

![image|375x500](upload://r30JWqv4ztygFMjzuVhBw8KRhs3.jpeg)can anyone tell me what this little cable are doing if i connect the baterie to te big cables the esc is working and i can connect the remote to the boosted board v1 but i cant start the motor. I think the old bms has send an singnal on a lower voltage. 

Thanks for help

They make connection between ESC and BMS...this way they communicate together, which is also the reason, why you cant use ESC separably...

IDK why, boosted probably ensure that it cant by moded, it might have some advantages :)

@Martinscce did you figure out how to replicate the CAN h/l data for your board to work again?

For others, is there a range of voltage accepted by the esc? I‚Äôm guessing yes, since they take on the extended packs without issues.

I got the same problem 
iv tryd connecting diff voltages to those 2 small cables 
3v,12v even the full 40v from the batteries
.remote connects to the board but it indicated low battery 
and does not start the motors
