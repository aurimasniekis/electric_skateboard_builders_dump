Hello, I followed this guide https://enertionboards.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000406455-How-to-configure-Raptor-2-Legacy-Focbox-with-BLACK-motors-OR-SILVER-motors-  to upgrade to latest bldc tool with my raptor 2 but I lost my slow and r spec modes. They seem to behave the same way. Anyone know how I can bring them back with this new setup?

Thanks
