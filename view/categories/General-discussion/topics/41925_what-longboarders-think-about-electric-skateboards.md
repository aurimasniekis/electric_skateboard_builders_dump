As I was browsing around Reddit, I stumbled upon a thread on the r/Longboarding subreddit that asked: [‚ÄúHow do you [Longboarders] feel about electric boards?‚Äù](https://redd.it/7ls93j) As one might expect, there were opinions a varying variety, some hate, dislike, appreciation, etc. What caught my attention was this [comment thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/longboarding/comments/7ls93j/comment/drrb4gu?st=JBNNLC60&sh=4cf714c7). 

Simply put, what the comment thread spoke of is that, from a longboard perspective non-mechanically wise (as in deck, structure, etc), ESK8‚Äôs are poorly designed. Here‚Äôs an excerpt of his opinion: 

> An unfortunate feature of the market for electric skateboards is the actual gear included in every production model I've seen is generally poorly designed.
> The electronics may be well thought out, but I have yet to see a deck or trucks that are remotely designed around electric skateboarding. Every electric board I see is built around a poorly designed deck that would be marketed towards a complete beginner.
> Making a functional skateboard requires expertise in molding a long history of functional cuts, concaves, and techniques. An understanding of why boards are shaped the way they are only comes from a few places. The first and most important is skating. Skateboarding a lot. This is why companies employ team-riders. The years and years that the skateboarding community has spent making minor tweaks to designs has brought the sport such a long way.
> The companies who make electric longboards have not skated much. They have not seen the dilemmas and problems associated with skating. Therefore, they cannot solve these problems, or even recognize that improvements are necessary.
> A lot of individuals and groups don't know how to make a good deck, and the worst part is they don't care to learn. They don't know why slalom decks have pointed noses. They don't know why W-cave is better in the back. They don't understand why measuring the cutouts in a freeride shape is important. They don't know the advantages of new-school drill patterns. They don't understand the difference between angle and rake! All this knowledge that could allow them to make something beautiful and new is waved aside for a 2-ply pintal with a nonfunctional kick and an attached flashlight.
> Electric board companies do not employ team riders to improve their design. If they do, then they do not listen to them for the purposes of easily improving their design.
> This is frustrating because the gear and decks that would be ideal for electric skateboarding are abundant. The longboarding industry has been innovating for years, and has legitimately improved the sport through intelligence, trial, and error. Electric board companies do not draw on information that is easily accessible to them.
> This results in badly designed boards that are unappealing to ride for anybody who has stepped on something nice before.

He later extends on it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/longboarding/comments/7ls93j/how_do_you_guys_feel_about_electric_boards/drrb4gu/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/longboarding/comments/7ls93j/how_do_you_guys_feel_about_electric_boards/drrb50j/). 

My question to you all is: What do you think of this? Do you agree? Disagree? Why or why not and what do you believe from a non-mechanical perspective that companies should focus on?

I totally agree with this article. This is the reason why I went for a DIY build. I've been through the beginner's process of choosing boards and now I get very picky over which board I ride. Personally, boards like the bustin sportster which have all the right curves (imo) are the only ones I would ride. I would like to be on a well trusted and familiar board going 30kmh+. 

This is the whole beauty of diy esk8s.

He makes some good points but......I've been riding skateboards for over 40 years.  Former skateshop proprietor with access to every mass manufactured (and many hand made) piece of equipment available.  My current quiver consists of six distinct skateboards.  Which one do I grab most often?  A 36" flat piece of solid oak with a wedge kicktail.  Stiff as a board, no concave, and yet it provides me with endless hours of fun, time and time again.

@Jc06505n I completely agree with this - it‚Äôs why I started designing and building (and selling) my own custom decks for Esk8. The deck is the heart of every build and the rider should connect with it technically/physically and also aesthetically.

If one has overlooked deck design thus far, there is a whole world of steez waiting for you to explore!

I shared that exact same opinion in fact I could have written that thing myself and I feel that I written something similar in the past here and other places this is why I got into electric skateboards and using my skateboard knowledge and knowledge of Electric Power Systems to bring them together and bring more skateboarding into the electric skateboard Market this is exactly what needs to happen there's not enough thought going into the actual skateboard it's a whole lot of people writing off the existing skateboarding industry as insignificant to this when it's the heart of it

I bet 70% of people on this forum have never used precision trucks, and are more then likely running stock bushings over tightened on whatever cast trucks they bought..and more then likely running clone flywheels. I bet closer to 98% of people(worldwide) that own electric skateboards haven't setup their trucks or wheels and have left it all stock... because they know no better because they didn't skate before.

Decks, trucks, bushings, wheels, bearings...the heart of an electric skateboard can't be overlooked. It is the most important piece. I agree with @squishy654, you can't just write off the skate industry and knowledge before us...

While that might hold true on the subreddit , that holds quite the exaggeration when It comes to this forum especially. And in terms of the ESK8ters outside of this community: probably ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. It‚Äôs like a car, there‚Äôs probably lots of stuff an average consumer could do to get better performance, but If the stock accessories works or is adequate enough for them, then they have no business modifying their stock Board, much less care about things such as precision trucks and bushings. And you can‚Äôt really blame them. They bought a product to do a task and if It does the task , power to them. If they want that ‚Äútrue‚Äù essence of ESK8ting that requires the innovations that Longboarding and skateboarding has created, then they come here where expert DIYers can advise and help them.

Let's start off with

- your weight
- truck type and width
- speeds you intend to ride
- skill? How comfortable are you?

Weight sets the biggest factor, riptide has a bushings weight chart to give you an idea of what duros

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/d/e/def714b088f9ddad7d001f9caf301780fde52985.jpg" width="690" height="487">

Truck type, top vs rkp bushing duros are alot different. If your riding for speed you should be using RKP. So let's just focus on width. Standard 180mm trucks that would fit a dual 6355 setup. You'll have less leverage on this then a wider truck such as a SurfRodz 200mm with long axles. So bushing duro should be softer for the narrower truck, and harder for the wider truck. Also remember deck to axle height changes leverage as well..ie drop through, top mount, top mount with riser...the further the deck from axle the more leverage you have

Again, speed, if your making a sub 20 Carver setup I'm sure using cones is fine. But if your gonna hit 25+ I'd suggest a double barrel, or a barrel/wedge or barrel/eliminator setup. More urethane gives better return to center and more stable of a truck while the truck is moving with the wheel around road obstacles.

Skill... basically you want to run your trucks as loose as possible. This means running them at optimal engagement with the right duro. Loose trucks don't suit everyone but ya need strong ankles. Truck kingpins should be tightened to the point at which you can barrel spin the bushings with your fingers...then ridden.

So for example.

I'm 127lbs

On Caliber 180mm
Rear: Blood Orange Wedge 86A board side with wedge washer, blood orange barrel 86A roadside with cup washer
Front: blood orange wedge 86A board side with wedge washer, blood orange 83A barrel road side with cup washer

On SurfRodz 200mm w/ 80mm axles
Rear: Blood Orange Wedge 89A board side with wedge washer, blood orange barrel 89A roadside with flat washer
Front: blood orange wedge 89A board side with wedge washer, blood orange 86A barrel road side with flat washer

See with the wider truck I needed to stiffen up the bushings to get the same feel. But I also don't want it to tight as the higher duro is a bit much for my weight, so to lessen restriction I use a flat washer instead of a cup. In both instances the kingpins are tightened basically just to engagement tight enough that I can just barely spin the bushing by finger with tight tight grip. This will increase your bushings life and also allow the bushing to perform how it is supposed to vs being precompressed and more then likely binding on the kingpin.

Also pack your pivots and wax your bushings for the surfy steez

Also the guys at my local skate shop we're helpful.

I'm weigh 156 lbs and currently ride 90a and 93a barrel bushings. Little bit too stiff imo but very stable at speed.

If the consumer is already satisfied with the stock trucks, deck, bushings , etc, then there‚Äôs no **need** for them to do so, just as if someone were to order a longboard on amazon and be satisfied with the stock, then there‚Äôs no need for them to change. Skateboarding/Longboarding/Electricboaring is what ever the boarder wants It to be and just because they don‚Äôt partake in a usual custom doesn‚Äôt make them any less boarders than you , me, or the pros.

I didn't say that..did I? I said most people don't setup their stuff for them. Your talking about $15 bucks of bushings and washers that changes everything about how a board rides and perfoms under a person's feet. Go ahead be satisfied, or whoever be satisfied with the stock bushings. But if your to cheap for $15 after spending hundred or thousand on a board and you can't turn your board and it never feels "right" under your feet...don't be cheap. Lol

I think there is a large gap between why we do certain things. For me, the reason i started skating as a kid was because i could only afford to buy a skateboard to get around my neighborhood. It became an obsession (going fast!) and I went as far as the technology could take me. 

With alot of the people I know who got into e-sk8, it was the opposite. Alot of it in my area, so far from what i've experienced (which I'm still new so I could be soooo wrong and I hope I am) the people buying them now don't care about that stuff. They don't care about pushing their boards to the limits or  figure out a way to carve a certain turn that no matter what, you wipe out on every time.

I don't think this is a bad thing though....since I've gotten back into this (still buying the parts to build my first e-sk8 board), there is SO MUCH MORE available to the people who want to tweak and push their set ups.

I found that setting up my bushings to my likeing my board seems to turn very well at low speed and be super stable at high speed. I'm using riptide bushings 90a board side front and 98a Street side front back trucks are 97deck side and 98 Street side I'm a 300lb rider though so this set up feels nimble to me.

This is a thoughtful comment and brings questions in my mind, are there articles available to educate oneself onto what to start with *then* tune  with our own body?

Like weight and size for deck recommandation.

My current understandings are : speed above 20km/h calls for limited flex deck or stiff deck  and as I'm tall, nothing shorter than my shoulders.

Bushings, I'll learn what's posted up there. 

Wheels and bearings, well it is also budget relevant for most people no?

i like running pretty tight trucks on a really short wheelbase. it can turn at any speed but tight trucks = no wobble (so far).

my esk8 has orange and blue barrels on calibers, which feels super carvy by comparison

This is something I really want to do. But to to honest it feels overwhelming. There are so many combinations, brands, duros and shapes. I feel that to really know what I like, I have to try a lot of combos making it quite an experiment and quiet a investment. Quality bushings cost a bit taking into account they are "just" rubber "things". And if I need lots of sets to be able to dail in my liking in will end up being some investment in bushings I might only use once for a short period. 
But I have some Khiros lying from when I tried to dail in my LDP board. Think I would start playing around. 
I would like to experiment with Riptide, but where to start :)

I really like the thing only tighten the kingping to the point where you can still turn the bushing. Never thought about that. It makes so much sense.

I apologize, I interpreted line here:

[/quote]

to mean that something like this is a necessity of skating with which I disagree with, especially when a huge focus on ESK8's have been for mid-level distance travel. It's not about price but more so about preference. Those buying boards like Boosted Boards or Meepo don't necessarily care (or should I say fully?) care about getting the best performance (if they did they would save up and invest in a Raptor, Metro, or DIY and get a disposable ESK8 in the meantime) They just want something out of the box that works, and whether they see fit to change anything or leave things as they have no bearing shouldn't be judged upon. If the board is okay for them as it is, nothing wrong with that.

Its really not that much

- Use the weight chart...I use blood orange not riptide..but the weight chart is relatively the same between them.
- use a bushing setup for speed. Ie double barrel, wedge/eliminator/chubby board side and barrel road side
-washers are cheap buy some flats and cups

Example, I'm 127, I like alot of rebound/back to center, and you should have the full action of the truck so it can't be to stiff. More rebound requires more urethane, so I'll pick the wedge/barrel.

From the chart it shows 45-64kg, I'm 57kg which put me in the upper 2/3 of the 65a-90a. The upper two thirds there is 80a and 85a.  So now my scale is 80a-85a or higher. 80a would be loose and 85 starting to be tight for my weight. 

As stated before.. I ended up with 86 and 83a on standard 180mm trucks. It's a good starting point, pick your brand, average your weight into the chart buy the medium-tighter side of your range, adjust restriction with washers. Will be almost perfect every time.

If you intend to skate with any sort of speed, it is a necessity .. unless your wreckless and don't care about your well being... Sure slow boards ya can't tell much difference. But go fast with trucks setup wrong for you... Tell me how it made you feel.

You should not tighten your trucks too much. If they are too tight it will cause the hanger to not rebound into the center position. So like when you are turning the board with stay in that turned position. 

I don't think that it's too big of a problem until your board runs away from you into the middle of the street. Also good rebound is important to have going fast. Keeps you going straight when going over bit rocks.


In short, it's just better to get harder bushings instead of just tightening your trucks.

Agree with a lot that has been said. Made similar remarks ages ago.

Decks, trucks, bushings, wheels, bearings...the heart of an electric skateboard
[/quote]

Amen, said almost the exact same thing in my [thread!](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/riding-tipps-introduction-to-high-speed-skating/19006)

But I would like to add a notion of rider improvement instead of overengineering and overspending.

[quote="Deckoz, post:7, topic:41925"]
I bet 70% of people on this forum have never used precision trucks
[/quote]

I love my precision trucks, tried so many and yeah some are legit bliss. Others only a minor upgrade IMAO. BUT, I ran all events, races in the past on cast trucks, simply didn't have the money. A cast truck can be suitable for a long ass time. Out of our group (25 riders) I think 5 are rocking precisions. Onne is a world champion, and the rest are poeple flying past on 60-70mph and competing in the world circuit. Basically if your riding skills are that good that the miniscule tolerances that precision trucks are superior are a benefit to you, then you should consider them. But honestly that is about 5% of riders who are within  that skill level, I would say.

Anyway what I wanted to get across is that members of the forum should accept that gear is important, but at the end of the day its only secondary. How good you are, how much you practice and how often you train yourself has a far bigger impact. It is not the price tag that makes it formidable it is how you use it.

Ps: @Deckoz 99% of times I read something fror you I completely agree, not ment as critique. Was only an example within the thread. I cherrish poeple like  you in this community who actually contribute annd put up good information. (learned from the past that poeple take my shit the wrong way :sweat_smile: )

@michichopf
 That is 100% truth everything you said.. especially about precisions...def not needed(but hey surf rodz are 119$ right meow!) But yea precisions feel really really good. My main point was in general people barely even setup thier trucks for themselfs to feel at home.

Gear is third I'm, safety gear seconds and rider skill first. Everyone should ride safe and gear up, we aren't the pros. But at the same time, the cheapest piece of gear on the board (the bushings and washers) are the biggest influence of change you can have on a a board that's already been "setup". 

Thanks for your input man

Channel trucks are mountain board spring trucks

Seismic g5s are RKP spring trucks for a street board to be used as AT

Both of which I would only use on an off roading/AT build... depending on the deck(mtb or street deck). 

I personally wouldn't use any spring truck for any type of street build for speed.

Not to discredit them, they do have a purpose...just thier purpose is for off roading.

What's interesting is that what he's saying is 100% true. Having skated for 13 years now, I came into electric skateboarding and said, why would you want any of the longboards on the market already? The deck shapes suck, have little to no concave, ect. Then don't get me started with enclosures...

I asked a good friend of mine who grew up in SF and now lives in NYC who has been skating the street almost as long as me.

And what he told me is real skaters there hate electric skateboard riders. Why? Because most of the riders have no interest in skateboarding what so ever... He said they feel like it bites on the culture of skateboarding, because people generally lump the too together now a days. But since so many of them barely can even ride their boosted boards, and have no interest in learning more about skateboarding, it annoys them and as a result, they publicly heckle people on eboards and are un interested in it as a result. Basically, it's not cool... My response to him though, is what's not cool about launching 0-35 mph in a matter of 4 seconds? The masses of skaters only know what they see, and since my target audience for my completes will be skaters, I have an uphill battle to convince them that they want a powerful electric skateboard.

@evoheyax , not directed towards you at all :slight_smile: , but somehow it is a trend on here lately, that poeple proclaim themself as experts of the highest caliber and spew hate and disbelief on others if they don't agree with them or don't show as much ambition as them.  

I mean, heckling poeple only based on your dislike of their disinterest is ridicoulus. Following that logic I would have to heckle pretty mucht the whole forum. E.G:"Why the F*** aren't you learning toeside predrifts at 60 mp/h you imbacile, you noob, shame on you you filfthy casual" I mean common, projection much ?

What skaters forget is the risk. As a park skater or freeride/DH you WILL get hurt. I haven't met a park skater who hasn't broken their arm, pelvis or ankle at one point (poeple pushing their limits). Or a freerider without some serious road rash or a trip to the ER. It is because we want to progress, daily if possible. We push ourselfs and our limits. 

That being said, there a longboarders who go for a short ride in a park, once a month, on flatground and for them it is pure bliss. Awesome right? There a freeriders who ride 5 times a week during holidays, eatch session over 6 hours, having road rash as their companion for the whole saison. Allways searching the next best spot, the next thrill and enjoying nature on those beautiful early morings while throwing down a mountainside at crazy speeds.  Aswesome right ? 

There are esk8'ters who just want a fun toy, go for joyrides after work before they go back to their regular family diner. Awesome right ? There are poeple who push the agenda of esk8 and go for 4wd builds, crazy speeds and serious riding skills. Awesome right ?

Could go on ad on and on... Basically to eatch their own. If a qeustion is not asked, don't force the answer on them. We live in the time of the internet, making innformation so easily avaivable. So IF somone has not chaged their bushigs or once touched their skatetool to adjust the trucks, it is just not in their intrest, or at least they don't have enough passion for it to spend 30 seconds  on google, meaning they don't really give a damn about that. They just want to relax, clear their heads and have some innocent fun.

It happened way to often that poeple who become ambitious in skating (esk8,dh,fr,etc) also become an elitist with it. Forcing your ideals, ambitions and ideas on others is disgusting, truely truely unsavory.

Let the guy on his yunec 2 have fun. Let the beginner at 35 have fun. Help if help is wanted, give a hand if it is accepted. But don't go forcing your shit on others and try to project yourself on aynone.

Sorry rant over :slight_smile:
To often lately there are poeple talking out of their ass withh bad information or pseudo-knowledge and force their shit on others on here.

Can't agree with you more. I can understand some of the frustration, but my point to him also is, does motorized bikes bite the bmx culture and thus, bmx riders will think it is uncool? I see more of the opposite. I think the skate culture is weird, in the sense that people are always judging you. You can't go to the skate park, with out many people judging the way you throw your board down when your running, or how you pop your board up into your hands when you get to the top of a ramp. I think they judge electric skateboarders from a place of ignorance.

At the same time, I see this culture of eskaters who don't know anything about skateboarding being an issue for the future of this industry. Why are skaters kicked out of everywhere you go? Cause someone somewhere's didn't know how to skate or measure their ability level, got hurt, and sued, when it was their own damn fault. So security will tell you to leave because your a liability in their mind. If these eboard riders don't take the time to learn to ride a skateboard properly, they will get hurt, and it will push places to ban them out of the fear of public safety. If you fall and squeeze the trigger (which is a natural reaction for some), you have a missile that could seriously injure someone, especially in a city.

Theres a lot of danger in eboarding that the people my friend is referring to don't understand.

It's like a car. If you don't spend the time to understand how you car works, and how to drive it properly in different conditions, you are a danger to the entire public.

The same logic applies to eboarding. If you fall and cause an accident because you didn't understand side winder trucks are not stable at 25 mph, this is a problem for the entire industry. If your riding around in a controlled environment and want to have some fun without endangering the public, ok, don't learn anything. But if you want to ride on public roads with pedestrians and cars, you should know some things about your board besides up means brake and down means gas... Otherwise, you are creating a risk not only to yourself, but the public at large. And my fear is this risk will limit the legality of higher power boards, if not eboards all together.

Just my 2 cents...

Yup. It is sad but so true.

Gehting worse though, since equipment allways improves but overal athletics and skill of the populus declines. My favourite analagy if asked to try or buy an esk8 is this (using their child/relativs to take advantage of their sense of protection and common sense). "Do you let your daughter ride a motorcycle if she cannot ride a bike?  Then why do you want to ride a motorized skateboard if a normal one gives you so much trouble?" 

But your point is exactly why we are organised as a club with a fee for our freeride trips and sessions. So we can impose rules and  etiquette that have to be uphold to participate.

I don't find in group rides the people who are likely to be problematic. Here in SF, we have a lot of techies (I will soon be one of them, lol). And anything new tech is cool to them. Electric skateboards are in this category, so many are getting them because why not, and they can help them get to the bus or train. But many have no concern to learn anything about skateboarding. Failing is an important skill in skateboarding. It's even more important if your riding an electric skateboard. How can you learn to fall at 20 mph on an eboard? You can't, you'll get hurt.

I think to the point where you heckle is stupid, but I share their frustration in the sense that the rider who knows nothing about skateboarding is a danger to themselves and everyone else on the roads.

And please, stop riding your boosted board on the sidewalk at 5 mph. If you don't feel comfortable going faster, do so on your own property. Pedestrians on the sidewalk hate it, cops hate, and it gives us all a bad image.

While I understand what you‚Äôre saying, riding a bike isn‚Äôt necessary for riding a motorcycle. You can perfectly learn to ride a motorcycle without ever having touched a bike ever in your lifetime. Sure It  would probably be easier , but easier=\neccesity. They‚Äôre two different machines that operation different enough that one isn‚Äôt dependent on the other.

On this hand, electric skateboards are similar enough to skateboards to work with your previous logic, except EK8‚Äôs are easier to ride (and to which I mean to move from point A to B) than skateboards. If they weren‚Äôt , then people wouldn‚Äôt ride them simply because they couldn‚Äôt. Should a person that doesn‚Äôt like to kick push not take up an ESK8 skateboard even though the entire way ESK8 works without It? I‚Äôm all for people to at least acknowledging the importance of skateboarding is to ESK8 and how the sport has the ability to make ESK8ting immensely better, but ESK8‚Äôs developed enough into its own thing that one does not need to know how to perfectly skateboard in order to get in a board and push a button. There‚Äôs a lot more to it of course and I understand everyone‚Äôs sentiments and opinions in his matter. But if someone can ESK8 brilliantly, foot brake an all, but is an absolute shit skateboarder, should he be barred from eve picking up an ESK8?

I‚Äôm quite guilty of this of my self and i won‚Äôt justify It simply because I do It for reasons do my own devices and reasons. Truth be told, these things will be hated whether your on the street sidewalk , or where ever eyes can see It was hated upon the moment It was a skateboard in the minimalist terms. Some pleases sidewalks are the only legal place to ride so a statement such as this isn‚Äôt fair to those individuals. Bottom line: ride responsible.

You make good points, but I don't agree with most of them. My example of motorcycle/bike wasn't only catered towards the argumennt that one is the basic of the other. But you said it yourself : [quote="Jc06505n, post:39, topic:41925"]

[/quote]
The problem here is, that poeple who take up esk8 don't spend time with an instructor, learn theory basics and equipment safety checks. So they really dont want to LEARN to ride a longboard, they just wing it. (I remember how seriously I got introduced to skating on public roads at 40-50km/h and how much effort I put in to be as sure as possible to not be a danger or annoyance to others). You know, because its "only" a skateboard. All an esk8 allows you to cheat on is not needing basic balance and core stability that you learn by pushing. Everything else is the same, meaning you loose out on so  much fun an potential. But like I said before, to eatch their own. It is scary if you find out how many poeple died on longboards without any need for it. 40km/h is enough to kill you on a board, poeple tend to forgett that. Safety trough information and training and experience is dear to my heart thats why I used to do stuff like [**this**.](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/riding-tipps-introduction-to-high-speed-skating/19006)

Completely disagree with this statement. Falling on a Longboard is different in all ways. Basically safety theory of falling revolves around the riding position and the vehicle you start to fall with. Meaning only similar meas of transportation and velocity give you the nescesarry muscle memory to fall correctly. I can only take myself and about 15 poeple who I showed and instructed on this as data. I actually started enjoying the training of falling so that I occasionally would flip my board intentionally and slide towards the group on my hands and shoes for fun. Experience and said muscle memory make all the difference falling. Saddly I don't have a good  example but  this is a recording of mine, falling at 40-45km/h. Recovery time about a second, no scrapes, no rash not a single ounce of pain.

Panicking and thinking gets you seriously hurt (during a fall), what you need is an empty head, good muscle memory and reactionary muscle tissue. I mean people used to try runing it off when they fall (poeple from the forum), until every last one of them came back for advice because they got seriously injured trying something like this.

It's all Razors fault.

Sometime around y2k a $120 Aluminum fold up scooter was invented and nearly everyone got one for Christmas except for the ones that didn't wait in line on Black Friday.


Yes it really was $120, maybe more idr..

Kids just quit riding skateboards or never tried as the razor was just easier to ride, and everyone had one.

Nowadays as a kid, it's normal to never leave your room except when your parents chauffeur you .7 miles to school. 

They don't even ride bikes or scooters anymore.

I definitely agree with the assessment in the OP.

For commercial boards, whatever, it doesn't matter.
Most off the shelf longboards have similar flaws.

Its just a bit worse for Eskate, and I don't anticipate it really changing.

But its also a bit of an issue with the community. I don't think its anybodies fault or anything, I think its just because the Eskate community is just so isolated from the longboard community.

It would have been so much better if Silverfish were still around, and the Eskate builders were able to have a home there among all the other skate disciplines, but Silverfish was already too irrelevant by the time Eskate communities started building up.

Its a little better here because its a builders community, and sharing information kinda what this place is all about.

Thats kinda the whole reason I'm here really. I'm actually not all that interested in building an Eskate ATM ( someday hopefully ) But this place is shaping up to be a pretty nice little knowledge bank.

And forums were always a much better place for actual discussion and knowledge building than places like Reddit.

Getting more annoying hearing it almost every time I leave now. 

‚ÄúCheater! You need a push skate board. Stop cheating!! ‚Äú

Some people are clearly joking, but others seem to really think technology is cheating. I can only assume they don‚Äôt ride motorcycles or cars because next time they see a bicyclist or the Flinstones, it‚Äôll get turned around on them.

And finally, does this drunk jackass really think I don‚Äôt have a normal board. I felt like yelling I guess you can maintain 20 miles an hour in San Francisco pushing on your board, but it just wasn‚Äôt worth my time.

I grew up riding street, pools and vert (12foot half pipe in back yard growing up)
My buddys thought longboards/ downhill was lame. As did i. Tried it eventually and changed my mind.
I definitely thought esk8 was lame at first. 
Back when boosted was pretty much the one and only and top speed was like 18mph. (That's just too slow for a longboard)
Skateboarders, primarily street skaters have always been a bit narrow minded.
Street skaters still don't like longboards much and downhill has been around for quite a bit now.
I think there's always going to be a little bit of animosity there. 
Longboarders are more open minded i think because they are use to the street skaters talking shit. Plus they wanna go fast to. Most street skaters i know can rock the park all day, but have zero interest in going faster than a light hill.
