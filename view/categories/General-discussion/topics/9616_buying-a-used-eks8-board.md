Guys, I want to buy a used esk8 board, but I never even rode one before :joy: So what do I need to look for when buying a used board?

Who it was built for, a board made for a 150lb person won't do too well for a 250lb person.

I would ask a bunch of question:

How many times was it charged? --> dertmines how many charge cycles you have left before you need a new battery.
Top speed? --> is it too slow?
Max range? --> Is the range to low?
What supply do you get? --> charger included? programming box included?
```
