I never use protective gear when i skate with a regular board since i now live in florida and it is flat. But the possibility of wrecking at 25 mph has me looking into pads and helmets. I am going to get some 187 knee and elbow pads cause of the open back on the 187 pro model. i had some old rectors knee pads back in the day with open back and it was way more convenient.
think i am just going to start with a regular helmet like this one... always loved fox

so here is where i am stuck. wrist guards seem like they would make using a remote annoying.... so what do you guys do about your hands? half finger gloves like this? maybe i can figure out how to add rivets to the palm

I use bike gloves and that is all. My current setup only goes 18 mph.

When I upgrade my motors soon, I'll be gunning for 35 mph and will be looking into a motorcycle helmet and full body suit as my first setup got up to 30 mph, and then the esc blew-out and threw me off with no protection. I had road rash all up my arms and my back and hands. And I don't ever want that again.

I ended up just getting triple8 gear since they are the only ones that make the half finger wrist guards. So i got their ep 55 elbow pads and kp 22 knee pads. I got a fox transition helmet for now. I have a shoei already but i Don't  really think i need it honestly. I am used to way bigger knee pads then the kp22's ... may try to find bigger ones later.maybe a chin guard helmet as well. Not sure yet till i go full throttle with my build. I have been riding mountains since i was 13       and never hit my chin. A parked car yes but not my chin. I am 35 now so maybe i should be more careful but where is the fun in that? Haha

haha, I'm a 22 CS student, who skates competitively. Falling at high speed is something I experience frequently (at least a few hard high speed slams per skate session), and thus, I am not phased when I fall on my electric board. Going under 25 mph is slow enough that you can roll out and avoid most injuries. However, when I fell going 30 mph, I tried to do my best roll, but it really did little but prevent broken bones and head injuries. Thus, at higher speeds, you need some protection that allows you to slide in the event of a fall. To me, that means a motorcycle helmet, full body suit, and gloves.

Old thread, but I didn't want to create a new one and have people say use the search button.  i just wanted to ask what knee pads do you guys use? Also, are these soft knee pads any good, i realized not everyone wears them, either because of money or because of how hard shell knee pads restrict movement and might add a lot of bulk. Has anyone tried these yet?  <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/c/cfeee7ff986fbc5a9586800499a834d00adb49b4.JPG" width="500" height="500">

Can't speak for the triple 8's, but I've got a set of G-form knee and elbow pads and they're really comfortable, barely notice they're there even after 4 hours.
Never taken a fall yet though, so can't say how they do in that regard.

@Rob.Endless I use triple 8 street knee pads. They're inexpensive and I only ride for an hour or so at a time, so they're "fine." No major crashes with them but they seem to stay in place.

I have kind of small head, well I have a long face (typical Swedish).
Most helmets looks like a mushroom on my head and makes me not want to use it. Yea sure I do use it! I got kids and don't want go down by not wearing a helmet, that's stupid.
But it would really help if I had a god helmet that also look cool on my head.
I have a TSG today, I believe there must be some other people out there that have small faces? Any ideas of a nice helmet for us?

I'm also looking at what gloves work well. Anyone here wear gloves? I also got advised on getting a cheaper secondary helmet while learning to eboard so that I wont mess up my CF TSG Pass.

@treenutter those knee pads look pretty good, no need to slide them up through the foot i believe, just straps right?

I know this may sound crazy but I just dropped $1300 on an armored race suit.  Matches my helmet and boards black and red perfectly.  Also will use it for downhill, and a sport bike in the future.  Would look even more awesome with a carbon fiber tsg pass.  And you would feel SAFE lol.  I know it's overkill, even for that 38 mph I hit on my board last time I took it out.

@Rob.Endless technically that's true, you could disconnect all 4 velcro connections and place the pad on your knee, and then retighten them. In practice, though, I leave them at a standard setting and then jam my foot through to get them on and off.

@Rob.Endless that's correct, although it's a pain to do it that way because it takes a while to re-attach all 4 connections. I slide them up and retighten the two outermost straps. For me to wear full pads on every ride, I need it to be quick!

The elbow pads that go with this set have a sleeve, you have to slide them up

I picked up a set of these for about $22 on Amazon, and they work just fine. I didn't want to drop a ton of money on new pads and end up not using them, but these are comfortable, affordable, and kind of have a Spidermannish vibe to them (not sure if that's good or not). I don't have a problem wielding my TB mini remote with the wrist guards on, but it does slightly change how you have to grip the unit.

@Nate the way I see it, you should never make first impact with your arms -- specifically your hands... that's where wrist guards seem to come in to play, they are more for roller derby where I think falling on your hands is more common than doing a full roll due to the skates. If I bail I'm going to make first contact with my knees (knee pads on) and then attempt to throw my arm out to go into a roll, mainly making contact with my elbow pads. 

I'm ultimately going to have both dainese trail skin elbow pads (in my post above) and dainese trail skin knee pads, Super stealth like G-forms but they don't break down as easily (at least thats what reviewers say about the g forms) and they don't look geeky -- can wear them under my work clothes.

Preparing for my GT street arrival; I went with:

187 killer derby knee pads

187 killer derby wrist guards (already broke my wrist once on a mtb). They are pretty slim and low profile

and Bern watts with a removable snowboard liner for winter. Sizing is not perfect with just a little wobble but its brand new and I don't want to spend more money for another one. I could use my Fox rampage FF but i wanted something more descrete (don't know how the authorities handle esk8s in Switzerland)

Yeah I got mine on amazon also and read the reviews. They do run a bit small, but I think they are meant to be tight.
I got small elbow pads. and Medium Knee pads. They fit great on me. I'm a pretty small guy 5'5" 140lb. They are tight enough to not slide off after hours of riding but also loose enough to not cut off circulation!
If you can go to a skate shop that has them, try them on first. I got them on amazon because of the prime free returns so I could exchange them if they did not fit. Fortunately, they fit on the first order!

Hi guys,

It might be a stupid question but has anyone considered riding their board with a leash so that it doesn't go rogue in case you fall off?

I was thinking of something like this

I use both g-form kneepads and elbow pads and i love them, don't think they'll slide to great but i dont think any of the mentioned softpads will do that. I'm also using my old TSG half-shell bmx helmet.

I used some cheap wristguards on my first ride, but they do make holding the remote quite awkward but it still works.

As someone who has taken a fall at 25 or so MPH on a Raptor I can say my minimum equipment is:
Bern Hardhat (in grey to stay cooler in the heat) with go pro mounts.
Kevlar reinforced rip resistant gloves (light weight but will not rip easily, no wrist protection built in).
Highly recommended after my wipeout.
I will be using my mesh motorcycle jacket with integrated forearm elbow and shoulder pads. You will likely roll and it will likely hurt pretty good. I rolled 2x hard and only slightly damaged my rotator cuff but after 5 weeks it is still not 100% after rest and starting my exercise routine up again. 
Get a front face guard if you will be riding / commuting on a regular basis real teeth are way to valuable to possibly explain unless you do not have them all.
Knee pads are recommended and I know a little inconvenient. I found Backladder work pants that I use for work, actually work really well with the integrated knee pads pockets that are really comfortable and you can simply pop out the pads and put them in a backpack if you want once you get to where you are going.
Yes I am a little older than probably many of you and heal slower. But take my advice as someone who still skates regularly because I still can. We will all crash eventually it is just a little more fun getting up going again than getting put on a stretcher and sent out for repairs.

Just a little bump to the thread here.

Looking at pulling the trigger on the Dainese trail knee and elbow pads.  From what I've read, seems like the elbow pads are a little bigger and I'm thinking of grabbing the M.

I prefer the look of the slim pads.  Anyone had experience with them in a wipeout?  How did they hold up?  

The hard shell knee/elbow pads look like they absorb more of the impact, but the soft shell ones look bigger to cover more of the road rash.  Any input appreciated....

the facemask - other than aesthetics, is it as protective as a full face or does it provide some other benefit?

I've crashed 3 times with the dianese trail skins. In almost all I walked away with no rash/pain in the covered areas. I did get road rash on my latest crash where I was protected, but that might've been because I didn't have the pad the snuggest it could be. The elbow pads fits very snug imo, same with the knee pads. I don't have the slip on knee pads though, I have the easy fit ones that are around $100 or so. 

Hard shells are better for sliding it out, the dianese pads don't particularly look the best after an intense crash but they can take multiple impacts.

not much actual protection - it's plastic. I got it so that wind would be out my eyes and not be tearing up.

Which ones are talking about?  Last night I found these Dainese armoform knee pads.  They look hardcore.   I need something a little more discreet, but look like they offer great protection and flexibility.  There's a YouTube video too that shows them in better detail.

@Nismo these are the hybrids.

Im also looking at the sector 9 gasket knee pads. I think you want as much plastic to slide it out like the ones you linked but these two are more lowkey. I also like the dainese hybrid arm guards

Have you tried Gform pads? I usually wear the knee shin gform pads under my suit pants so its barely noticeable unless i sit down. A forewarning though, don't expect any soft shell pads or hybrid pads to stay fitted if you take a hard fall. The problem with soft shell is that they move when you fall too hard, they're built for impact rather than road rash and you'll most likely slide when you fall so soft shells usually gets move lower. They're great or mountain biking etc but for asphalt going over 20+ mph? Not so much.

If it's of any help, here are my protection set up:
Helmet- Uvex Jackkyl hde (this one is great, love it, I got it straight from Germany. Removable chin bar and incredibly light)
Arm/Elbow- Fox Racing Pro Elbow Guard (had two falls, these gems worked better than expected)
Knee/Sin- Fox Racing Pro Knee/Shin Guard (judgment still out on this but they feel great staying on)

Apart from keeping wind out of the eyes, does a full face helmet do anything else? What's the face protection made of?

Jaw protection. Wind is actually secondary unless winter. If you live in urban environment, factors such as pot holes, cracks, cars, pedestrians etc. can cause a lot of accidents. Only takes one accident to ruin it for you. 

Falling forward sometimes can mean your jaw will hit the ground almost as fast as you raise your arms to protect your brain. Even rolling off the momentum can cause jaw dislocation. Obviously there's a lot of what ifs, but I like to take all necessary precautions because after all, this sport is pretty deadly. Think of it almost as insanely dangerous as bike racing.

I still haven't figured out the perfect esk8 gloves.  Looks like you are forced to pick between either abrasion protection or impact protection.  

Wrist guards are the only thing that really works for impact protection.  If they had a full fingered glove with a built in wrist guard I'd go for that!  I know they have one on amazon, hillbilly something but I've heard negative things about those.

@Nate - thanks. looks like my weekend rides are going to need a helmet...

@Photorph - I tried riding with my snowboard wrist protectors, and Lush sliding gloves, and man it sucked big time.  From the pics above, it looks like one of those military type gloves with wrist protectors.... and maybe the trigger finger on the glove cut in half for the remote... ?

@Nate  Yeah I figured the soft shell wouldn't hold up as good as the hard plastic in a slide.  I was looking for something discreet as I mentioned cause it isn't really legal to ride where I'm at and thought I would like to fly under the radar, instead of looking like a rolling Robocop.  But now I'm thinking its just better to be fully protected.  I saw the G form pads, I do like the look of them. 

I'm just wondering if it might be better to switch to something that can be strapped on instead of slipping on.   I think that if I was to go riding with a friend on a bike, I could swap the pads to them easier, and get lower legs covered.  Says they are low profile.  I think I will go with them instead of the trail skin.  Dainese V E1 N.  Not sure if its on purpose...but spells out vein.

I think this is a good option. If you can have a combination of straps and slip on it'd be better. From experience, slip on don't stay in same spot when you take a hit and straps usually loosen when you walk too much. But combine together, I think they work great.

I just received some hillbilly half finger guards and they're very uncomfortable holding a remote. It doesn't sit into my palm and Im gripping it with the last knuckle of each finger. They seem great aside from that. The splint is raised off the palm a lot. I'll be returning them

Got some protective gear

187 Killer Knee+Elbows (really solid and slide well, (yes I was sliding around my house on my knees, who doesn't when they get killer pads😂)

Gets quite hot wearing them on 20-40 degree days so I'll be more careful until we get some cooler days here

Rocking a helmet from a few years back, don't like the artwork on it so I'm gonna change to a PROTEC black helmet

Maybe a mask...

Need some advice. I was in a crash last Friday and had to go into surgery. Reason? My protective elbow and knee pads shifted, even though they were strapped tight. Big gap in my arm and skin ripped off in various places. 

I need something that stays put and handles sharp stones without any issues. One time use after falling is OK. Any tips? Mountainboard use.

Something I don’t see mentioned much is boots. I accidentally engaged GT mode on my Evolve board, at a low speed, but took the brunt of the fall on my ankle, breaking the fibia and now spending the next 2 months recovering from surgery. I was wearing converse and I suspect if I was wearing a more supportive boot, I’d not have broken it it. Any suggestions for something between a skate shoe and a lightweight motorcycle boot?

-tsg force va
-187 killer pro derby
-poc joint vdp 2.0 dh

TSG, and a kevlar shirt with built in pads and kevlar jeans with built in pads, both from revzilla.com.

groups rides and shit i just wear the helmet though. 

in fact i may get a regular non-full face helmet just for derping. Sometimes the TSG is too much, but most of the time it's fine.

TSG Force 3 kneepads

Tripple 8 slide gloves w puck on left hand because there's not enough room on the right with the remote

If I'm not taking my speed board out like usual, I'll just do helmet, gloves, and hoodie.
