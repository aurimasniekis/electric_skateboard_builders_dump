the electronics are gonna be based on the remote that solidgeek made.
the remote design is based on a boosted one,  but a little bit more aggressive
the feeling of holding it is gonna be similar to a boosted one.

Why the cutout on the lcd? Might as well use all of it. Also travel distance for the wheel matters. Boosted has the ideal range of travel I find.

Looks good apart from the lcd cutout I think.
