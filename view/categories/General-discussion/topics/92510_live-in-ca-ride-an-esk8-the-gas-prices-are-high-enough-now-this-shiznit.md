Here is what we in Cali deal with on top of highest gas $$ in country and higher gas taxes and rising dmv fees.![Screenshot_20190501-231527|250x500](upload://1vb17oTGeH8yNyN9h9SXSDMi6bY.jpeg)

Gas in my area is anywhere from 3.80-4.50, can’t keep filling up the accord, it’s killing my bank. Esk8 is the way to go. 

No @b264, I’m not getting rid of my car, I need it to go to work.

I hope the gas prices in the entire country go that high.  And higher.  Only way to get electric cars on the road.  And maybe convince folks to live near their job.

@b264 I wish we could get that idealism started. People would have more pride if they worked and lived in their communities. That's how the natives did it!!!

But that can’t apply to everyone. I live really close to one of the 50 buildings I work at. I have to transport millions of dollars of gear (in my car) between those sites.

How do you suggest I do that?

Not everyone can live in a city a few blocks from their office, it’s just not going to happen.

If I could I would.

Oh yeah. Diesels are more expensive. Every time you step on it, it’s a bottle of beer gone lol. 

What happened to the gas price? Just go up for no reason? I went to Utah for a week last month. Came back to 3.8/gallon.......

Always thought you BAESK8 people got to skate everywhere and wouldn't need a car.

@moon @lrdesigns I know right? But it's what we all get accustomed to. I remember when I was younger getting gas for my parents. I would hand them a $20 bill and get change back after a full fill. These days I'm filling my truck (yeah, another American stupidity) at about $75  

I hate that electric cars either cost a lot or looks like crap. Maybe it's the way I was brought up, I would always be the $25K car driver, new or used. I'm currently looking at getting a used BMW i3 for my wife (no need to lecture me about the looks) since they run in the $17k-25k range. The Tesla is still more tech, less car to me, at $50K I would just buy two civics :thinking:

I could skate everywhere, but driving is fun too. I use my board to get the last mile-ish to work.

That's like saying a Boosted is board is more tech, less a skateboard.

So I don't outwardly talk about this often, because I don't want to sound like a zealot like Brian (<3 you bud), but I'll share here. 

Last summer I stopped using my car to get around Portland as a challenge to myself, commuting every day rain or shine, no Ubers allowed. I even run my household/shop errands on esk8, essentially l've used it as my primary method of transport for the last 11~ months. The only exception is that I have to pickup/dropoff my daughters as I have split custody.

Gas prices weren't a factor as most Americans don't know how good they have it. For me it was really a way to push my builds to their break limits and get everything battle hardened and road-born. 

And because I fucking hate traffic, given that my city is full of hippies too busy ironically apologizing to trees as they drive 11mph. 

I average 900-1100 miles a month riding esk8, my commute to work every day is 8-12 miles each way, depending on the route I take, and then I ride in the evenings for fun/exercise. I'd say I've managed to average 2-2.5 hours of riding every day, unless I'm out of town with work. 

For me, not having to deal with traffic and having a fun way of getting around town is a huge quality of life improvement. It takes commitment to build a quiver of boards that can be ridden every day and hold up to all the environmental and use wear that comes with it, but it's been a fun experiment and challenge. I don't see myself stopping anytime soon.

The point wasn't just high gas prices guys. It's that the article talks about the pumps reading that there is gas going into the tank when it's not. Obviously people in smaller countries are paying twice as much as the US but they also don't have the commute most Californians have. Shoot San Bernardino country can swallow a few countries it's self. Obviously the whole world is overpaying already. But damn it the pumps are fucking us too???
