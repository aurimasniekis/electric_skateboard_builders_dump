 I have been wanting to share this with you guys for sometime. I purchased this enclosure for less than two dollars. I like it because it allows me to access the lipo batteries for charging.  I glued it to the bottom of the board using  Shoogoo. It works, but it looks really ghetto.  Other solutions rely or screwing the cover on the bottom, which would make it difficult for charging. Does anyone have a better battery cover solution for those who use lipos?

EDIT: Some terrible voice to text transcription hahah

Sandwich boxes are legit. It doesn't get any better than this for $2. 

Check the dollar stores and kitchen wares departments of stores for silverware and drawer organizers and other open top containers, some people use velcro straps to hold those on. You might even be able to rig something up with a hinge and a latch.
