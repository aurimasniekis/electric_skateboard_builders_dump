What's a better alternative to the Evolve Bamboo GT Deck but is exactly (or almost exactly) a copy in terms of dimensions and size?

I used that [on my build](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/first-build-db-freeride-dt-38-evolve-trucks-dual-racerstar-5065-140kw-custom-10s4p-30q-focbox/37352), apart from the micro drop and better shape where you feet go, itâ€™s very similar.

Looks good. Why did you need to shave the deck a bit though? Was the bite constant?

Not constant but with loose trucks it did touch the motors a bit. Was an easy job tbh, u can't even tell it was shaved.

Edited: there is also a 41 inch version I think.

I also use that deck after i got inspired of your build!
Can highly recommend it, the small drop feels super nice!
