For those of you that came - Thank you - I hope you guys had a good time.

For those that missed it, I hope you make it next time

Of course, there is still high excitement from last weekends event. Understandably so, since it’s the first time many of us have met face to face.  It’s the first time some customers have met the vendors/builders they buy stuff from.  It was an amazing interaction between everyone.

A lot of new friendships formed over the weekend, as well as new alliances & collaborations. 2019 should prove action packed.

So, what’s next? Over the next few months, I’m going to figure that out. Of course with some help from some of the people that attended the renegade weekend.

We are already discussing plans for the next one. And the second one is probably gonna be a monster. Why? Because I want ALL the Vendors to attend.

Things are still in the planning stages....So....this is your opportunity to voice your ideas, thoughts and suggestions. But there is no guarantee I will use them .... keep that in mind, and don’t get all pissy if I don’t include or use your awesome ideas.

That’s the latest update for Esk8Squad Renegade Weekend 2019

Colorado FTW!

Or a coast change would be cool too.  Asheville, NC has a shit ton of Breweries for instance.  Or New York.

Whenever we did our yearly three day car forum meet and greet we did it near a camp ground. Saves some a lot of money, some still stay at hotels. Good way to hang out after events.

Portland
[/quote]

There's a outdoor gocart track just south of Portland.  Owners are pretty cool. They have open drift days. Track is wide enough for tandem drifting (barely).
Bet they would let us take over for a few days with proper compensation.

Closer to thanksgiving break, I’m going to drive from SD back up to Vegas for a rematch. ... didn’t really get to race anyone during renegade weekend. 

I want to ride the wetlands, all of it. 

I’ve got room for one other if anyone wants to go. And no, you can’t bring your chihuahua. 😒

Well from Spring lake to Bradley Beach there is ocean Ave that it has no traffic lights no stop signs unless you are turning onto ocean Ave and there is a bike lane for spring lake and Belmar. I no there are trails not that far Allaire state park, Manasquan reservoir, and sandy hook proving grounds.

Yes summer you need beach badges. There are 2 breweries and one distillery in Asbury Park. Plus plenty of bars within walking distance and 3 
Hotels that are beach front. And I got a connection with a company that owns like 4 restaurants there. Also the town is very LGBT friendly and has a night club. Belmar has a brewery that has a good atmosphere and a part that overlooks Main Street Buy the beer isn’t as good.

Asbury park late summer.  we need to get a local scene going before anything national.

i am willing to travel to AP 4 sure.  LBI too.  we should talk about a group ride in november.

Philly might be a contender too.

Well I'm looking at sometime early June to do the big esk8 squad event, but generally I run rides every Sunday at 12:45 except for this weekend because I'm trying to queue up with our boosted group for a bigger ride. That said if you ever need to stop by and use my mini USB to do some programming you're welcome to stop over.

There's a growing Boosted Board club here in Orlando.  There's also a group of DIY and Evolve riders that get together occasionally usually late at night downtown.  If we reached out to everyone I'm sure there would be a decent turnout. 

Tampa could be a good location.  I haven't hit Riverwalk yet but I heard it's good and their esk8 group is bigger.  I think @longhairedboy made a youtube video at Riverwalk so maybe he can chime in on it's worthiness.

I literally just joined their facebook group yesterday. They seem like some cool people and they were open to me, a non-boosted owner, and seemed amenable to letting me ride with them. 

Did you know boosteds are running 225-3M-15 belts? 3M. So weird. I had no idea. I learned that yesterday in my new group.

Yea I saw your facebook post.  I recently joined their group too after running into them down at Lake Baldwin.  Nice folks.  I may join their group ride this Sunday.  Not sure what kind of range they get but like you said on facebook group rides in Orlando are scarce so beggars can't be choosers.

There is a meetup for DCESK8, I can reach out to them and see what they have. I usually stay out of the city and ride out where I live. But D.C. should have some good stuff. 

Let me reach out to them and see if any are on the forums and if they have any suggestions!

Thats my new standard of whether @longhairedboy is actually happy. 

No Snot Bubbles = frak off mediocre person
Snot Bubbles = yeah he's cool, he made LHB snot

@mmaner @longhairedboy   Unfortunately our marketing team has been thrown into complete chaos with the rebranding of the VeGa platform into what is now known (at least colloquially) as DaVeGa. So with all hands tied I figured I as their lower-tier intern could mock up a potential design for review and as a direction-check for where we want to go with this project as a community. Preliminary calculations have led to the formulation of the meter listed below. However this should be considered unofficial at best and is subject to potential drastic revision.

edit: I apologize for the lack of relevance to the overall thread but 'rocket fuel and mescaline' was too good not to build off

I'm trying, I've already got a motorsports complex set up for a day of off road races and a day of on road races on a mile track. We just have to get a deposit set and ill start setting dates, but likely looking at around June 13th to the 18th if possible, if not the following week

A little porn of the complex. Go kart track upper left corner, possible dirt track on the right corner. Images of the dirt track are not current.

Thought you all would enjoy our Enertion video from 2017 with Moja to get you hyped up. You get to see Moja and I race an uber driver, a race of boards against electric coolers (yes electrified coolers for beer that you can ride) and some of the trails around Denver. https://youtu.be/BQvkrj9i8Vs

Damn I wouldn’t be able to go to the 2019 meet up because I wouldn’t be able to take that much time off of work with me going to Maine that following weekend. Maybe there can be mini esk8 renegade weekends in NYC or something. There is actually a small stock car track near me could probably figure something out.

@Michaelinvegas what are your thoughts on trophies for the events. Not for races, but more car show style. 
*Best of show
*best 2wd
*best 4wd
*Cleanest build 
*best innovative build
*community choice
Just examples.
