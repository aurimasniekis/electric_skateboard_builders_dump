Here is my first print and paint of the Firefly Nano shell. There are some noticeable failures on this first attempt but they have been fixed on the other attempts I've made while I wait for them to dry here is the first one. ![IMG_20190316_212428|375x500](upload://k2nBAey2byO76MqYHaq0EI33jP9.jpeg) ![IMG_20190316_212428![IMG_20190316_212341%5B1%5D|375x500](upload://nkwPsUPoZIeq7kMldPPxif2Yu0F.jpeg)
