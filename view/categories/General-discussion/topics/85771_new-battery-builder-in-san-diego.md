I recently went on a group ride with several evolve riders and had a blast. On that ride, I made a few new buddies! Not only are they on the site but they build and repair batteries. @RedBaron hooked my tb 12s4p with a new bms and fixed the cells for super cheap! Added a loopkey to bypass discharge as well!!! Kept the voltmeter working. I will add pics once more space is available! San Diego people.... we have a legit local builder,......although he doesnâ€™t sell genuine gold motors ðŸ˜œ

They make me nervous. 
I could easily stuff a 13s3p pack (22-24 ah) 
......
Jkjk, I used the damn search button like god intended and These cells have been put through their paces already on the forums.

The general idea is, the more it costs, the better it will work

@b264 I will find my free esk8 lunch and eat too, some day, maybe.

Off to measure some IRs. Best case, Iâ€™m going to offer tows on my 4wd. Worst case, Iâ€™m making the largest 3s  spotwelder power supply on the west coast.

So far I love the way he handles his business. Constant communication and pictures... always keeping me updated on what is going on and how long it will take... and SUPER punctual. If he quotes me two days, itâ€™s two days. @RedBaron is definitely a legit batt builder and repair guy. And a big big shoutout to @thisguyhere! The battery I ordered from him came in and its a work of art!!! Itâ€™s crazy to think that jjst last year I started this not knowing how to solder and thinking about buying a swagboard..... now i have 3 10s5p batteries, a 12s4p, a 10s lipo and I wouldnt dream of buying anything sold in a store. All thanks to you guys.... Big thanks to the community!!!
