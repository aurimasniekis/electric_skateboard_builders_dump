20 grand to float a foot off the ground for 6 minutes at a time? Those people are insane.. I was seriously waiting for someone at the end of the video say that this is some sort of parody.. but it's not lol.

I'm impressed that someone has actually made a hover board.
as opposed to all the "so called" hoverboards we have seen up until now.

and lets not forget what the early motorised skateboards looked like

they weren't always the sleek sexy things we ride today..

I'll be impressed when a so called hoverboard can do anything even resembling how a skateboard performs. All of the iterations to date have been CLOWN SHOES.

Early E skates didn't look anything like that mountainboard either. Look up Exskate.

the picture I found may not be technically correct, (just something found on google) but it certainly represents those clown shoes you speak of.

what I am trying to say is everything has humble beginnings.

Yeah, I hear ya'! But that's an emtb. Probably about a year old. And mountainboards aren't clown shoes. They're bad ass!

It's a good concept but 20 grand is a bit high... Edf jets attached to a foam box with a bunch of 18650 cells and some gyros and controllers. Doesn't take much
