Hey there everyone! 

I previously started a discussion [here](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/esk8-class-and-club/64466). Since then, the project has come from an idea to reality!

My name is Jake De Necochea. I work for the Grow Manufacturing Initiative of Northern California. My job is to connect advanced manufacturing with education to create a technologically skilled workforce. I am working in conjunction with the Butte County Office of Education STEM Ninjas program to teach a class in electric longboarding. They have allowed a budget of $25000 to build a curriculum and allow for other expenses that may come with the class. 

Since the idea has been approved, I will begin work on the actual curriculum and program planning. The mission statement of the STEM Ninjas program is to offer projects that students can bring home and replicate on their own, while teaching STEM practices. The eSk8 program would be no different. High school students would be taught what an electric longboard is, how it works, why it works, benefits of it, safety, and finally how to build one. They would be provided the necessary parts and tools, and students would be allowed to to keep the boards. We would take group rides to different manufacturers in the area for tours as well. 

Major goals of the program are to allow reliable transportation for students in low-income areas, inspire students and show what they are capable of, and teach a wide variety of skills in the STEM field (including mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, soldering, basic tool work and safety, engineering processes, physics, etc.).

I'm trying to decide what age group would be best, and I honestly think upperclassman students would be the best target audience. Juniors and seniors tend to be far more mature and level-headed, and I believe will take the program more seriously. I would accept younger students if they showed strong interest, but no one younger than high school.

What does everyone think? Given the three month time span, what should be taught? 

Distributers and manufacturers: It would be greatly appreciated if bulk discounts could be made! Would anyone be available to do that?

Educators: Being that I am only 19 and have no formal education in teaching, I may need help with building an effective high school curriculum. Any tips you would have? I am adept at public speaking and creating/giving presentations, but I have never done something on this scale. 

Thank you in advanced to everyone!

(I am a Highschool student, so I am pitching in from what I believe may be a valuable perspective)

Make it experiential. If the class is on electric long boarding, allow them to build and experience their own. I don’t know how many students you have, but given that buying many parts can lower the price of a reliable electric longboard to as little as 500/unit , I really think you should allow them to learn by doing.

Step 1: layout - all of the parts, how they go together. No real esk8 yet, this could just be a PowerPoint telling them how to put it together.

Step 2: explanation - same thing with PowerPoint, but you explain the science behind each part and how it interacts with everything else. 

Step 3: build your own - order parts and allow students to assemble their own unit, customizing it to what they enjoy.

Congrats overall, I really think this has the potential to help a lot of people. Consider also showing them this forum, the knowledge here could advance their education as well.

I am very interested in getting into the educational space. I can definitely help with bulk discounts, and the 3 month time frame gives a good chunk of time to get everything sorted.

I have been working on kits for a long time and I think this would be a great way to get the ball rolling. PM me and we can chat on the phone if you want

Wow, that's a big budget. Hell if you're allotting about $400 per student that's 62 students through and through.

I would say the best age group are indeed Juniors and Seniors, Primarily Juniors. By then they would at a time where College is creeping up and them and the adults around them would be asking "what do you want to do with your life". Introducing the world of ESK8's could open a world to many students who are unsure of what they want to do in the world. 

In a three month time span , I recommend spacing it out into three divisions: Planning, Skateboarding, and Electronics (The order is up to you).

For planning, understanding how to budget and understand the up-taking for projects is important in this field. Software such as 3D Modeling could even be introduced. 

Skateboarding is important because these kids are going to eventually going to use them and they need to learn how to fall, proper stancing, and how important safety gear is.

The electronics, being the dangerous of the three is of course self explanatory. 


For decks I advise using CustomSkateboards.com as they're relatively local and do bulk manufacturing. It also allows you to give the kids variety at low cost. If you are able to establish a relationship and transaction with them, please have them come over to the forum! It would be awesome to have a home deck manufacture here on the forum. 

Try hitting up caliber or Paris to see if they give you a educational bulk discount. The CS over there is good enough where I think something can be arranged. If not, maybe @torqueboards would be willing ?

For mounts and things related to building a drive train, perhaps a belt drive would be best (educational wise) since i don't see companies like May-tech or Winboard giving education discounts for hubmotors but trying would'nt hurt. Maybe there would vendors on the forums who are willing to help out in supplying en-mass parts at a slight disocunt.

@anorak234 I like the idea of customization, but only to a certain point. It can become pretty hard to coordinate that many builds though. Maybe have different setup options, or two or three different builds they can do? Considering the time frame, I think that is all doable.  

@Jc06505n Agreed! I am excited about it for sure. That is all really good input. I would like to focus the program on STEM practices as well. I like the idea of 3D Modeling as well! I will definitely start hitting up manufacturers to see what they can do!

@Jake2k17 Noted! May I ask why you think that?

For carbon fiber boards I could get some free samples showing the layering involved in making carhon fiber boards from a mold.
Just hit me up and well work it out.
Sounds like an amazing project and coming from a family of teachers in all for education.

Well, many people my age want to try out my board, but they don’t really care about the mechanics, just how fast it goes. Also, we aren’t really taught about engineering at all, so it may be too advanced for any high schooler who mainly taking general ed classes. However, my school disctric offers a STEM program, and only a select group of kids get in. I think a class like this would be a good fit for STEM. By the way I go to Santa Clara Highschool.

For starters and could take up some time in class, would be some dc theory and ac theory. Get them edumacated on the electrical portion.  What about a 3d printer for the class? Then you could do a crash course on 3d modeling/cad.... i dunno maybe not enough time for that. I know the main point is to build a e board... but if you have all the parts you could handle that in the last month.

hey man,
i have run some basic classes like this for students in 8th- 10 th grade here in Spain both with public and private school students. i ran it as a hands on course, allowed students to bring in their boards and take them apart just to get into the fundamentals. i bought a few soldering irons and some hex keys.....it makes for a good time and can seriously connect the content. 

im now in a great school with access to Vex systems, 3 d printers and ive convinced them this year to purchase a small CNC so hoping to expand my programming a bit maybe next year.

plan it out would be my recommendation....put in the hours before hand and they can be supper successful.

good luck brother

hey hey, i'm in my final year of high school (year 12) and i'm building an electric longboard for my final project

I also did a STEM course back when i was in year 9 and we experimented with drones (parrot minidrones to be exact). I dont know if it helps but i think it would be a cool idea if the students were given a baseline (such as it must be able to push x amount of weight, should be able to travel up steep hills etc). I think this is an awesome idea and i'm totally behind it! All the best to you!!!

Separate them into group, have them collaborate on a part design, ie enclosure, deck, pulley cover, pulleys, motor mount,...  You'll be surprise what they can come up with.  
I designed and machined different parts for esk8 and customized many different mounts for folks on this forum.  Check out my website, Janux-esk8.com for pre-build drive trains for ideas or individual parts / kit they could put together.  
I might be able to help machining their final part design. 
Which part of California are you in?  I am in San Diego.

Holy shit, this sounds awesome, I had to wait until uni until I could incorporate building something fun into my bachelor thesis..I think its important to keep a fundamental level(depending of age, of course) but also have a deeper learning for those few that might be curious about how things actually work, besides the building of the actual board. Something worth thinking about.

Maybe discuss different manufacturing techniques and materials. Where you would use them, how you could use them, maybe a demonstration or something. i.e. using fiberglass, carbon fiber, vacuum formed abs, wood, aluminum for parts like the deck, enclosure, and motor mounts. That would be really interesting. I just finished my first year of college and I haven't seen or heard of any manufacturing courses in highschool or college which talk about designing around abstract materials outside of metal. I just made my first fiberglass enclosure and it came out well but was a completely different part than I expected.

I'm already thinking about having students vacuum form their own enclosure. Fiberglass would be interesting for sure though. I intend to have some sort of cnc process, likely 3d printing because it's readily accessable. Not sure what parts I would print though 😂 possibly wheel pulleys?

Idk how well wheel pulleys would hold up but maybe custom controller designs. I had one of my friends make a 3D printed mount for electronics that would go inside the enclosure so I could stack some parts. I think what you are doing is the coolest thing. The only thing better than building and riding an electric skateboard is having friends that also have electric skateboards so you can ride together. Idk how deep into engineering you want to get but you could have them do experiments to see how fiberglass and carbon fiber affect how a deck rides and its durability. Fiberglass wasn't too expensive. Especially if you buy in bulk. For my enclosure I spent about $35ish on fiberglass equipment and foam for the mold. I did not use any vacuum bags though.

@Chrisfl  I have used a 3d printed motor pulley before, it actually worked suprisingly well! I will say it was nylon though, and that material was made for that application. Controller enclosures would be a good idea!

@marcmt88 the problem is cost. How much would you charge for materials and stuff like that?

@Saturn_Corp I will, I promise :joy: I am in the middle of moving though, so printers are down until probably monday or tuesday. I have another customer that I am going to print for first as well, although I can probably use two printers.

Maybe try and organize some experiments so instead of just building the electric skateboard, the students get experience developing a product and applying data to develop their end product. They do not need to be huge or expensive experiments but maybe do some motor testing, destructive testing with the electrical load different style connectors can hold, materials testing or maybe some durability stuff. Idk how much you can pack into a semester but a few experiments would be cool and probably go over well with the school administration. Have them write lab reports and share the data with the esk8 community. I'm sure people could benefit from some data based decisions.

I feel like it's important to make sure they have some freedom with this, rather than provide all the parts for them and let them build it themselves. Motor/ESC/battery are things that should probably stay stock, however dividing them into small groups and allowing them to come up with solutions for motor mounting/enclosures/board type would allow them to learn loads about the design process rather than having everything handed to them. You could always have stock enclosures/motor mounts on hand in case their designs end up not being viable, but this way they would get the true engineering freedom so many of us love.

Side note: Will you have access to CNC/3D printing/etc.? Otherwise the whole "hands on freedom" thing gets really difficult 

Keep us posted!! This sounds like it's going to be an amazing experience :smiley:

Please have a set budget to contain costs. You might as well just make it an engineering class using Fusion 360. People I talk to would say Solidworks at the University I went to. PTC Creo 4.0 is free to student but it's much more advance in features compared to Solidworks. Fusion 360 will work for your needs not to mention the static simulation required for some analysis.

Edit: props to you @TheFluffiest because you can now slap this on your resume for the leadership category

Hey everyone, bad news. That large sum of money has been withdrawn due to complications with BCOE (no ones fault, just budget cuts). Because of this, the planning of the class has been put off until further funding has been found. Thanks for everyone's support! I still have full intentions of building a class out of this, it just may not be in the near future.
