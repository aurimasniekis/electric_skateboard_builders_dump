Any new standards that are supposedly "best practice" --- but then use Imperial units instead of metric have me scratching my head :thinking:

I am all for standards.  But Freedom Units?  Seriously?  Why not 19mm?

because this is skateboarding and skateboarding has always been in inches…we can just accept our culture as is…it’s not a bad thing, but trying to change the skateboarding world into metric would be impossible…

This is because all new things should be metric, including new skateboard standards.  There is no desire to change old things into metric.  Only new things.

Hate to say it, but I don't think in "deck" terms you will never see metric, except trampa..

skate hangars, axles, wheels, all metric.

Decks, wheel bases, hardware, all imperial... 

is magically every US deck manufacturer supposed to list their stuff in metric, when more then half of US population has no idea what a millimeter is?

 "Millimeter, you mean like that dudes peter? I don't know metric dudeee"

If you produce new eskate trucks you can measure them in whatever unit you F$#%#@ wish, but it would be helpful to everyone if they were this particular size to match the others coming out…how’s that?

I like the whole idea.


BTW I wasn't trying to go against your suggestion.. just jokingly saying .75" is alot different then 190cm :)

@squishy654  thinks it's off-topic, when clearly it's talking about the best way to make a new skateboard standard and almost everyone agrees.

He messed-up and doesn't want to admit it so wants to start a childish flagging war.

What he doesn't understand is that we think this is a great idea.  Except one tiny detail.  Which is what this whole thread is about.

Since you're talking about a NEW standard use the best system of measurement available - metric.

ummmmm... that's not how any industry works. The science dictates everything. I like the idea of having a standard, and both of those trucks admittedly look fantastic. Yet, 2 companies relying on 3/4 inch hangers surely will not outweigh the amount of precision trucks which will follow in metric dimensions due to the simple logic of using that system over our outdated American measurements

I don't have a single skate store in my country (France) that will use Imperial. Everyone knows imperial is imprecise and useless since there's like 2 country out of 196 that uses Imperial for the wrong reason. USA only used imperial because they wanted to be unique, since it's been invented everyone in the world uses metric. It's called a norm.
It's like when the Nasa lost a billion dollar satellite because they did some mistake because they were using imperial and nobody else in space uses Imperial. 

 Skateboard culture is 100 % American but saying it's been Invented in America is kind of BS,  then I could say Swedish invented skiing, and French invented pétanque.

Wrong. NASA and most of the Aerospace industry work in standard units. Zzzz
I don't understand why it's so hard to understand. 
Most machine shops I've talked to have all of their equipment, bits and jigs setup with standard measurements in mind. Even if you ask for a part to be done in SI, they will ask you to either convert it, live with the tolerances or provide the tooling yourself. 
If you don't know how to convert units, then you should not be an engineer...

NASA thinks imperial units are a bad idea, hence moving towards adoption of SI. Don't believe me...

From [here](https://www.nasa.gov/offices/oce/functions/standards/isu.html).

> Public Law 94-168, §2 requires use of the International System of Units for measurement in U.S. Government programs, "except where impractical." That requirement is reflected in NASA policy, NPD 7120.4. That measurement system, formally known as the "SI" system," after its name in French, Systeme Internationale, is almost universally used by all countries except the United States. Use of SI measurement is growing in importance for international trade.
> Although use of SI in the U.S. is increasing, aerospace is recognized as one area where adoption will be difficult, due to the long-standing use of the U.S.-based "inch-pound" system for aircraft.
> Nevertheless, space programs do make significant use of SI, particularly for science measurement, and increasingly for hardware and operations, particularly as international cooperation in space increases.
> The Chief Engineer serves as the Metric Executive for NASA to meet the external requirements of 15 U.S.C. §205b and Executive Order 12770.

AS someone who worked for NASA less than 2 years ago, I'll tell you that most of them think differently. If you went to the NASA Armstrong Flight Research Center machine shop today with a drawing in SI units, they will not make it. If you went to their hardware depot, they stock all standard size screws from 2-56 -> 1/2-20 and larger diameter in a stupid amount of lengths. If you asked for metric screws, they stocked 12mm, 6mm and a few other oddballs. 

I am talking from experience and not from something I read somewhere...

Man, there's a lot of aggression in that post.  Does it really matter whether we use inches and you use millimeters?  Ans then you say something like this...

[quote="ElskerShadow, post:56, topic:56220"]
USA only used imperial because they wanted to be unique
[/quote]

That's just silly.  America was founded from Britain, which used the British Imperial System of measurement, since everyone here already knew how to use it and the French Metric was just being developed at the time 17 frikkin 90) Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson (yep, the same one, its been a few minutes since he was around) decided we would just keep using what we had always used.

I've gotta say I'm about fed up with all the anti-american bullshit I hear around here.  This ain't about politics, systems of measurement, whether your dicks bigger than mine, its about skating with motors strapped on and taking your life in your hands for a good time, so everyone please ease up on the BS and lets just skate.

Frankly, its just all over the place.
Axle sizes. 8mm, 10mm, more often than not trucks will use the nearest imperial equivalent instead.
Unless they're precision, then they're actually metric.

But then even axles that are imperial, the lengths are metric, bases on the mm width of bearings and spacers.

Truck mounting pattern is inches, but the mounting holes and hardware are metric.

And while the mounting hardware is metric, the kingpin is imperial, even though its going into 10mm holes in the bushings.

But isn't 3/4" and 19mm close enough that it doesn't matter? I used to be an auto tech and if I couldn't find a 19mm socket handy a 3/4" would always work. I'm so used to this mix of sizes that it's not an issue for me at all.

 You have 1/4" 3/8" and 1/2" ratchets and the cars I work on use all metric bolts so I have to go find my 3/8" wratchet with a 6" extension and a 10mm socket that I always lose lol
