Would it be possible to put the motor of the enertion raptor dual on the evolve Carbon Street using the electronic and battery of the carbon to build a "better" Carbon gt only with less range?

I would advise starting from scratch, try to find a similar GT carbon deck and start building yourself (if the raptor dual is not your cup of tea in looks), not giving in any range.

Well there you have it. Just transplant the r-spec from the raptor and let us know how it goes.
You know, for science.
