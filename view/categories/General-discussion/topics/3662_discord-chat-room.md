Hey. I made a discord chat room so we have a place where we can talk shit more easily and people can ask those quick questions they have that don't warrent an entire thread. Join up and hopefully we can get some fun convos going on :smile:

Go to https://forum . esk8 . news

Take all the spaces out before and after the "." and you'll have your link to better resources than here.
