As humans, we have a nasty habit of taking things for granted.
So, I just wanted to stop and  say Thanks to @onloop for hosting this awesome forum
And Thanks to all who contribute their time to help make it great!

I've been meaning to mention how much I like the forum's mobile interface. Whatever software engine they used for the forum it works better than all of the others I've seen.

[/quote]

yea, thats what I find really sad as well - there is no reason for me to go anymore, noone is inspiring me, hardly any comments on anything. 
problem is that the ES structure is also so bad in comparison, cant find anything there. this here is really well structured, tracking is so much easier, I like "liking" and bookmarking things and the @-functionality is great when you want to get someones attention. also posting pictures is really convenient here.

I must say, this forum has to generate incredible traffic. I used to upload pictures all on my private webspace and when I started to give more detailed build threads on endless sphere, those few Pictures generated more than 30GB traffic every month! :astonished:

Gotta give respect and gratitude to @onloop. It's a serious thing that this forum has become. It's a beautiful thing. We share and experience each other's joy and passion. We witness each other's creativity and ingenuity and it makes not just better hobbyists, but more well rounded people. I feel a deep debt of gratitude to all of the people that have made me feel welcome. It can be a little intimidating stepping into a forum filled with such amazing minds and talent, but it feels like everyone just wants you to succeed. I love that mentality! We can all agree, disagree, or otherwise, but we can keep in focus the reality that we are all on the same team. It's a pretty cool team. I'm a nobody here, but I'm trying my best to learn, share, and create.  I will pay it forward to the utmost of my ability. :grinning::v:

the only thing I miss is a view in which every new post is listed at once. At the current rate it su**s to have to click on a gazillion of topics just to read the few new posts. (I know I could just wait until there are a reasonable numbers of new posts in a topic - but who wants that really ;))

not the topic overview - all the actual posts so that i don't have to go and click on every topic in that list you showed.
because right now I have to click and wait for the topic to load, then go back and wait for the overview to load, then click on next topic and wait for it to load, and so on and on

I owe a sincere apology to @lowGuido and I promise no more sarcasm, maybe less sarcasm. I really appreciate all you respected buttholes here on this forum.. @onloop @lox897 @cmatson @link5505 @Photorph @sl33py @anorak234 @torqueboards  .. all you are appreciated and I apologize to you all.

I'm relatively new on here but I want to thank you all as well.  Before I found this place I was just a dude in a group a friends that had this crazy idea about how to blow through a whole pile of money I should be using for other things in life, you know like school or rent, but here I'm not alone in my crazy passion. That and before I started looking at the vast amount of knowledge on here I had no idea whatsoever about what I was doing. It was both intimidating and scary to start this investment but once you talk with a few guys and get your bearings(not a pun) and discover how to properly use the search function your worries are put at ease knowing that theres so many of us here and you guys are all so willing to help. It's an amazing place.

Hey!...

wowsa.. getting very lovey in here! i like it! :heart_eyes:

Thanks for the appreciation it means a lot....  YES, I have put in lots of work for the benefit of the communtiy, but for me it doesn't seem like work! I am very passionate _(as some of you may have noticed)_ about the accuracy & quality of the content we create & about the advancement & progression of this new industry!

I am here because I truly believe the self-built-esk8-movement will eventually take over! _who doesn't want to have a sweet custom ride under their feet?!!_ The mainstream brands will never build anything powerful enough and I predict by as soon as late 2016 they will be playing catch up to our technologies.

As long as we are all open & honest & diligent and strive for constant betterment we, the community of esk8 builders, will be unstoppable.

I'd like to thank my competitors specifically @chaka @torqueboards @elkick for constantly giving me motivation to improve & simultaneously annoying the fuck out of me, without firece competition i might grow complacent!

I'd also like to thank the community for making amazing esk8s, always great inspiration.

YES, I agree this platform is fucking awesome! _sorry ES you just didnt cut it_

The one thing I do like about this community is it been pretty open. Discussions get heated, but it's becuase we are so passionate that we sometimes get blinded and lose grasp of the bigger picture.

Thank you @onloop for your work. I would likely not have gotten into this if it was not for your videos and help.

Thank you the entire community for your insights, inspiration, and great innovation. You guys push my creativity, and remind me that your imagination is your limit.

I gotta say thank you to @onloop as well for your passion, dedication, and this killer forum. Definitely the best format I've experienced in an online forum, and it's a pleasure visiting, participating and learning EVERY SINGLE DAY. One thing nobody talks about is the TIME budget involved in this hobby, which I think I've blown by about 10,000%. I had a feeling that this hobby might get expensive, but I never thought that i would be spending 100's of hours on this forum absorbing everything I possibly can. This has become one of, if not the most enjoyable and addictive hobbies ever, and a huge part of that is the direct effect of this forum. 

I also want to thank all the other vendors and members for being so helpful, and creative. I am constantly inspired to try new things from watching what everyone is doing. I just wish I had time to actually get out and ride more. The struggle is real.

i wasn't sure what to expect when @onloop invited me to be a poster/moderator on this new forum he was creating. I was honored, but skeptical. Then i got to watch it grow from just a few people to the esk8 horde it is now. IT has been very entertaining and educational, but more importantly it feels like home. 

So thank you all for this wonderful community, and thanks a lot for the mountain of debt i've incurred due to my addiction. lol

in late 2014 i had a choice between a theatrical storm trooper costume with all the movie quality trimmings or some silly esk8 kit from some bloke in australia. Now I have one officially licensed blaster and a garage full of decks and bins and gear and materials to build sick steezies for my peeps. 

I'm still going to get that costume one day though.

I've been online since the late 90's and have watched the Internet become what it is today. In that time I've done and participated in pretty much every new tech / thing / meme apart from the new stuff since my kid was born (tip for new parents: try Lifecake for family photos), and I've gotta say this is one of the best forums / communities I've seen. And I wouldn't say that lightly. The software (Discourse) helps loads (this is where ES fails), but the personalities give it life. 

So think first congrats are to everyone here: keep it real folks ;-) and to @onloop, thanks to you too dude ;-)

in some ways yes. in others no. 

people are still dicks, even though we have unlimited knowledge at the touch of a phone... think that's really, really important - the moment forums become hate places, is when they die. luckily, as some folks have pointed out, people here seem to be able to argue in public without getting personal, which is a great sign ;-)

Thanks @onloop . I literally stumbled upon e boards by accident 4-5 weeks ago. Thanks to this forum I have learned a great deal on the subject. I have ordered  and  am waiting for a raptor with all the bells and whistles and I am currently starting a mountain board build for my son for Christmas. Also I am gathering as much info as possible to make my own battery packs in the future. None of this would have possible without this forum and those who take the time share their knowledge.Thanks to all.
