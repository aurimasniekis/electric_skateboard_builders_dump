This person, assuming it's actually him and not a trip, had a history of defrauding people. Do not buy from him. You've been warned. 

@treenutter, @Namasaki, @anorak234 somebody with more juice than I've got needs to get involved here.

It is hard to believe that he would dare to show his face in this forum at all let alone trying to sell  boards.
I have taken action by deleting all of his post, deleting his account and blocking his email and IP address.

Then again, you just don't know.
If someone was playing a prank, it was a very bad idea.

I'm gonna start a company called "Take My Money Industries". It's gonna sell amazing shit for great prices, but also be non-profit, and give back to the community however it can. Basically, the exact opposite of those jokers. As soon as I finish the rest of my builds... :upside_down_face:

he looks both 30 and 13.


But I mean he's no new evil that's unheard of he's just a guy who stole from us.
He didn't rape or kill anyone.

He's just like others who think people are just rocks floating and why should he have less than us.
I had a cupple with a buggy take/pickup 20LV (10 euros)  that fellout of my pocket I looked at them in disbelief
But for them It was fair game so I moved on not makeing any fuss.

Some people pray for money and they think God's giving it to them in cases like I've mentioned.

So all and all nothing new Just another dude.

There's no way that Alex would register here again using the same name. I don't understand why someone gets banned because of a user name unless he /she did something really bad apart from choosing the "wrong" name. Either a coincidence or a bad joke. First ask/confront the user in question and - worst case scenario - change the user name. 

I've also seen stuff from this - Chinese- alex tech on amazon and/or other sites.

The forum member that created the original fake Alex-tech account, and the second one here seen tonight, was identified and suspended.

Just a friendly reminder - it is against forum policy to create fake accounts, especially those that impersonate a past or current member.
