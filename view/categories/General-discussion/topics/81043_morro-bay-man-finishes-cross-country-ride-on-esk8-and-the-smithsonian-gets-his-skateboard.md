Even more impressive, he did this on hubs w/thin urethane. And this was his 5th cross country skateboard excursion. :exploding_head: Looks like he was riding an Inboard, but other articles showed him with an Evolve at the beginning. Crazy.

What about "inner state" style? Spend 2-4 days traveling the state to different places. Set the way points, provide charging @ way points. Hit each way point in order. Some way points would be charge only and others would be chill and charge (race breaks for entertainment and resting/sleeping). Next day starts the race again @ previous intervals. First one to last way point wins...

A van hooked up with  a bunch of extra generators connected to the drive so could charge a bunch of extra car batteries and then use them to charge boards w lipo or iron batteries at 20 amps and backrolling quickly sounds nice.  If u wanted to do cross country.  

But having a car following is hard to find but a super fast charger and a Starbucks w a huge allowable current draw and could go solo. Maybe a panhandling permant sign to pay for snacks along the way. And bring your tent and go for free. No planning. I bet people would come up on u while riding and fill your cup w money to support you continuing. 

Anyone write the guy and ask him to tell the story n take questions here? Maybe we should skip him and ask his wife!  Iâ€™ll write him if no one does

I wrote n linked him to this thread.

It was an amazing journey, being 62 and having my wife as my support team made it even better. My favorite thing about the ride was riding the back roads of America, rolling through small towns. One town we went through had a population of 4...and we met two of them!

My favorite section of the ride was the Great Allegheny Passage Rails to Trail bike path, I was on it for about 130 miles. The part I rode only had about 10 miles of paved surface, the rest was crushed limestone. It was packed so tight that I was able to ride the Inboard on it. The path took me through some beautiful forests and over some incredible trestles spanning rivers and highways.
Here's a photo from the first day on the GAP Trail, just south of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

Hey Mobutusan, I started my ride in August of 2016 in Eugene, Oregon and made it to Mountain Home, Idaho before I stopped...had a couple of close calls. I was riding Evolve boards for that part of the journey. When I decided to finish it up two years later, Inboard came on as the sponsor. Here's a photo of me on an Evolve in eastern Oregon.

DAddye...I was very impressed with the Inboard M1, the only issue I had was receiving an overheating warning on the remote, and that came while I was climbing a 7,000' pass in Wyoming. It was a 7-10% grade I had been climbing for about three miles, into a headwind on a 90 degree day. I picked up the board, walked for a quarter of a mile and then started riding again.

The biggest issue was my lower legs going numb especially on rough roads. To help alleviate this I installed Loaded's Pushin' Cushion under the griptape on two of the [Inboard Technology M1s. Orangatang provided me with a couple of sets of sleeves (softer duro) for the hub motors, I also ran Orangatang Caguama 85mm 77a wheels on the front of two of the boards. One board remained completely stock.

I wore Kybun walking shoes with thick soles most of the ride, when the roads or bike paths were smooth I would wear Vans.

When I felt my lower legs getting numb I would stop and walk around a bit to get the blood flowing again. This could be anywhere from 3 to 10 miles depending on the road's surface.

I was very careful, and didn't experience a single fall during the ride. I haven't noticed any health issues since returning from the ride. I usually push my traditional longboard three miles every morning and try to get an eboard ride every afternoon.

Inboard has been very receptive to my suggestions.

Here are a couple of photos of the three boards I used.

RunningOnEmpty...had to answer your question, the Jackson Browne album "Running on Empty" is one of my all time favorites. Here's a photo my wife took in western Wyoming, if this wasn't the middle of nowhere, you could definitely see it from there. It may not have been the weirdest part, but it was definitely lonely. We hadn't seen another car in about an hour when this photo was taken.
Thanks for asking!

Hey Mars, I had a couple of motivations. The first being that ever since my first relay push across America in 1976 I have always wanted to do a solo ride. The second being, that I like to finish things I started...i first attempted the eboard ride across America in 2016, but stopped after about 450 miles, to be blunt I got scared. I had a couple of close calls with vehicles.

If you scroll up a bit you can find the answer to your leg cramps question in my reply to DAddye.

The hardest part was the chip sealed roads in Idaho, lots of vibration which caused my feet and legs to go numb, Here's a photo.

What you can say about cops? I'm not from USA, but eboard being a grey area in most states and ridding on highways should have caused some problems? I remeber you telling about a highway officer suggesting a better route somewhere

mmaner...it was definitely epic. So many favorite things, just being able to ride everyday (except rain/rest days) was amazing. When you're crossing America on an electric board you get to see everything up close and personal. I really enjoyed the wide open spaces and skies of eastern Wyoming.

Hi Pedrodemio - Thanks for following us! We had three interactions with the police/highway patrol. All of them were extremely positive. All were just interested in what we were up to. Two of them stopped to check on my wife as she was waiting in the support vehicle, and then ended up waiting with her until I arrived. 
Had two officers in Iowa help us get over the bridge that spans the Mississippi river.

You may have a point. Though it's interesting, on my four pushes across America, I think we had less than 10 encounters with the police, only three were negative, two of them by the same guy...eight years apart (1976 and 1984 in Wisconsin). In 1976 were all 19.
Not sure if I posted this previously, here's a link to an short film about the first ride.

```
@Irdesigns - I have pushed across America four times, so I've gotten fairly good at route planning. The route I used for the e-board crossing was a hybrid of the routes I had used before. Out west I was mainly on secondary highways, there aren't a lot of choices in states like Oregon, Idaho, Wyoming and Nebraska. I avoided four lane highways as if they were the plague! From eastern Nebraska onward I was able to utilize a lot of county roads, usually these are in decent condition and have very little traffic. I also made use of "rails to trails" bike paths whenever I could. My favorite was the Great Allegheny Passage between McKeesport, Pennsylvania and Cumberland, Maryland, about 130 miles of crushed limestone...and no cars!

There were a few bridges that were too unsafe to ride over, we also hit a seven mile section of dirt road on the very eastern side of Nebraska, with no alternative available we drove that section. 

Riding through large cities was my least favorite, unless I could find a bike path such as I did in Des Moines, Iowa and Washington DC. Funny story, I got lost in Des Moines when the bike path ended, and since I don't like looking at my phone or wearing earbuds while riding, I called my friend and 1984 cross country teammate, Gary Fluitt, who was following me via "location sharing" on Google maps. I held the phone to my ear as he gave me turn by turn instructions until I got back on the bike path.

Every night we would let Gary know our ending location and where we wanted to get to  the next day. He would then look at our pre-planned route on Google maps and also Google Earth and send us a link the next morning with any changes he thought were needed.
