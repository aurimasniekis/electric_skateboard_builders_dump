> ## [NEW: 2017 Electric Skateboard Buyers Guide](http://www.enertionboards.com/ultimate-industry-insider-tips-buying-electric-skateboard-2017-buyer-guide-how/)

**Warning:** This article was meant to be a generic overview of the cost of building your own electric skateboard & it was meant to be short!............but it turns out its a fairly complicated topic because it deals with business ethics, manufacturing, over engineering, the false economy, psychology, customer satisfaction & expectations and the intricate details of the emerging DIY electric skateboard industry. I also had to make reference to my business Enertion Boards for real life examples so what was meant to be extrospective now might seem a little introspective.... 



> If you want quick answers here they are:
> ----------------------------------------
> **YES** building your own electric skateboard *can be* cheaper than buying one in a box.
> **NO** a self built eboard probably won't be as good or better than a bought one if you buy all the cheapest hobby gear available.
> **YES** a DIY-e-SK8 will be better in nearly every way, including reliability, top speed, torque, range, aesthetics & charge time if you build it with quality & custom made electric skateboard parts.
>**NO** Just because you build something yourself doesn't mean it should be cheaper then something pre-built.
> **YES** You will waste money blowing stuff up if it is the cheapest stuff you could find on the internet. The cheap DIY eboard build quickly becomes the hole in your pocket!

-----------------------------------------------------------------




Often people will comment on [The Enertion Boards YouTube Channel][1] about the cost of building a DIY electric skateboard using enertion parts VS just buying a "boosted Board" or any of the other "in-a-box" solutions.

The comments usually go something like this:

> ***"Your parts are too expensive & I also have to assemble it myself so it should be cheap, why don't I just go by a boosted board / zboard / marbel / inboard / .... etc... etc??"***

Its a great question! & The answer is actually fairly complicated
---------------------------------------------------------------

Now don't get me wrong, I am the first to admit that not all Enertion parts win the prize for being the cheapest available and really that's not my objective in business! Go to hobbyking.com if you want the cheapest junk electronics you can find (note: they also have premium stuff too that is expensive). Or go buy a piece of shit complete longboard from amazon if you think our trucks & wheels are too costly.... Our mission is to provide High Quality, Affordable & Purpose Made parts to make building a High Performance, High Quality, Reliable, Electric skateboard at home Quick & Easy. 

So it's true some of our parts aren't the cheapest on the internet! However the stuff we sell lots of *("lots" is a relative term - I run my small business from my garage so packing 20 or 30 orders a week is what I call "lots" but its really nothing in terms of manufacturing economy of scale)* such as the motor mounting hardware & pulleys are actually very competitively priced with little profit margin... So to all those internet trolls please go & do your homework before you blurt out your ridiculous comments on public forums, such as "that too expensive, blah" it makes you look uneducated! & you are probably the perfect candidate for falling into the false economy TRAP! So beware!

It's also worth noting the Motor Mounting parts we are selling cannot easily be made yourself at home without very specialist tools & prior knowledge. They are custom made parts, manufactured in small production runs. So yeah a motor mount & pulleys and a drive belt is probably always going to cost over $100 for at least a few more years until our company or some other big name player does a run of 10,000+ units which is when you can start to get parts made very cheaply. For instance instead of CNC'ing parts from aluminium billet you would cast everything in molds then polish it up... & its probably half the price! But not as strong!

If you do want to prove me wrong though please go ahead, I now offer my Enertion Motor Mount designs free of charge through an open source license for you to make at home... or maybe go get a quote from your local CNC shop to make one set... then you will understand how much it costs. [Download files][2]

*Anyway.....*

**Lets talk Electronics**, The custom made electronics components are the products that most frequently get perceived as expensive by the novice eboard builder, Such as the Enertion S.P.A.C.E Cell Battery, The Enertion R-SPEC Motors, VESC (An advanced open source motor controller) .... Yes this stuff will very likely seem expensive in comparison to the common parts that most first time DIY Electric Skateboard Builders source from hobbyking.com. Its because they are better parts & they are custom designed to give you a better build quality, better features, easier assembly & superior reliability.

**So why does everyone always look at buying most of the parts they need from the online hobby retailers when all this awesome custom made eboard stuff is now available?**
There are two main reasons.
1. The parts from online hobby stores are super cheap & people love cheap!
2. It's what they have been told to buy by the majority of DIY electric skateboard builders on the online forums for the last few years, mostly because until recently there were no other good options, such as the items I listed above. 

**So if the hobby stuff is so bad how come more people aren't complaining?** People are happy to document their build and show off their handy work, but rarely will people completely and publicly document and discuss when their self built pride and joy caught fire during a catastrophic motor seizure that catapulted them 20 feet through the air into a pile of stinging nettles..... Maybe it is the fear of being wrong or feeling like your building skills are not as good as others.... Don't get me wrong, from time to time you will hear stories of how someone's DIY electric skateboard build failed, But for every story you hear there will be 10 more stories of product failure that you don't hear about on the public forums... 

I know about this topic well.... I have been building electric skateboards for people since enertion officially launched about 16 months ago.. When I started out I also only used hobby parts & Flier ESC's... Hence the reason I stopped selling a lot of electronics kit on my website... Reliability was terrible! Failure rate at one point with Flier ESC was about 2 in 10.... That is really bad for business, which I will discuss more below! The 6S Lipo Batteries I was getting from hobbyking.com where also terrible and would commonly get puffy or have bad cells, not to mention a pain in the ass to charge.. One of my customers nearly burnt down a house because he left a faulty LIPO battery on charge at a mates house (thankfully it was outside on the deck) and went to the pub...BAD IDEA!. The cheaper battery chargers where also shit, I think I had about 3 or 4 faulty units in one batch! & the motors where hit & miss.... That is when I realised if the DIY electronics skateboard industry is going to be legitimate industry we need to improve every part! we will need better quality everything!

> I realised if the DIY Electronic Skateboard Industry is going to be legitimate industry we need to improve every part! We will need better quality everything!
> ------------------------------------------------------------------------


**In this paragraph I will focus on reason #2 from above:** When I first started to research how to build an electric skateboard I had no prior knowledge of RC hobby electronics, I didn't know what an ESC was or what 6S LIPO meant! So like anyone you start reading what other people use, I spent about 3 months doing solid research. This opens up a can of worms, as everyone uses lots of different stuff.... But the common thread is that most of it is purchased from the online hobby stores. So you assume that it must be ok stuff (*like I said, people rarely report failures publicly*), so now all you need is comprehensive list of the parts to buy... and fortunately in the online forums eventually people made these lists, some folks were even selling this info because it was actually not available in a concise format anywhere. Eventually the info became freely available in a digestible format. Here are two of the most comprehensive ones:

[> FREE Step By Step 6S Electric Longboard Build Guide][3]
[> How to build an Electric skateboard tutorial][4]

  
Both these lists are amazing because they are a blue print on how to build your Eboard & What parts to buy & why.... This would have saved me a huge amount of time if they were available when I first started researching my first build which was probably 2 years ago now... Before these lists were created you had to compile the knowledge yourself from reading 100's of different user "build threads" and asking heaps of stupid questions.

**So if these list of what parts to purchase are so useful, what's the my point?**
The problem is the lists where made just as business like Enertion Boards were being born (and DIYelectricskateboards.com), There was no VESC, there was no custom made 18650 Batteries with BMS and simple one port charging (no one was even talking about 18650 for eboards), the where very few custom made motors with modified shafts & keyways, there where no custom made compact remote controls and there was only one place (Alien Drive System) to buy a motor mount and it only was compatible with one truck type.

Over the last two years if you wanted to build an electric skateboard you were told to buy your motor, battery & esc from the online hobby stores & if you wanted a *"better"* quality ESC, or a "dual motor esc" to consider buying one manufactured by Flier (A Chinese factory who make various ESC) sold by Alien Power System & previously Enertion, DIYelectricskateboards & Bubble Gum Boards (who no longer trade, mainly due to reliability issues with cheap electronics)

**Well I am sorry to say but all this information is now out dated!**
--------------------------------------------------------

> **NOTE REGARDING THE FLIER ESC:** Originally available only from Alien Power Systems, eventually word spread that the supplier was a Chinese company called ShenZhen Flier Electronic Co, These ESC actually use to have a very good reputation and I still have some that work fine, but something seriously went wrong just under 12 months ago and the reliability turned too shit! I have a feeling that some of the parts they where originally used may have been substituted to lower grade components to save money, also I think changes were made with the firmware that caused lots of problems. When stuff catches fire it is bad for business, so now I refuse to by from them.

The fact of the matter is, in this game you get what you pay for! So maybe enertion electronics are a bit more expensive but that is because we have had enough of the rubbish hobby grade gear! When you buy enertion you are buying the next level up, so there is plenty of reason to pay a bit more initially to save you hassle later. It is in our best interest to ensure the board you build with our parts is extremely reliable & far better then the "in-a-box-solutions". 

It is extremely important for our business that our reputation remain unblemished, So let me explain further some reasons why Enertion went the "premium" to "semi-premium" route (*There is always more expensive stuff we could buy and try to sell to you but there is actually a point when there are diminishing returns - just like the old saying "don't gild the lilly"*). As I mentioned, Basically I got sick & tired of bad quality electronics, its impossible to run a business if you have product failures. Yes, things will always break it is impossible to guarantee they won't that is why we have a warranty. The problem from a business point of view, with cheap stuff that fails frequently, it is exponential in the negative effects it has on a business & brand reputation and word spreads fast when business don't deliver what they promise. 

This might sound counter-intuitive as I just finished ranting on about how people don't talk publicly about product failure as much as it might actually be happening... Well there is exception to this rule... If the person buys the parts in a kit from a specialist retailer (such as enertion) who claims to have quality custom made parts that make building a high quality reliable electric skateboard quick & easy.... well now they would have much more reason to publicly vent about how shit the gear is from enertion if it was actually failing. In comparison If it was the board they built with various parts they sourced from hobby stores and combined them together in an ad-hock way they won't tend to complain out loud from fear of being held responsible due to bad build quality, or being an idiot! no one wants to look like an idiot in public.... and even if people did complain out loud about the hobby grade gear that failed on their electric skateboard hobbyking.com doesn't give a shit! they will not try to develop a better product.

Anyway this is not meant to be an article about consumer psychology, but the point is it's our responsibility to make really bloody good quality stuff that works reliably and is easy to install. By doing this it legitimises the DIY eboard industry! Also, It gives less ammunition to the crowd funded electric skateboard companies... They (or their customers) should not be able to criticise the DIY electric skateboard industry by claiming that their products are more reliable or have better quality.... 

> *Visualise this for a moment, you pull up at the traffic lights on your DIY rig, right next to a guy on his brand new top of the line boosted board, you both look each other up & down then finally give the nod... signalling to each other a DRAG RACE will commence on green!... the lights turn green and.... You either leave the guy in your dust or your board starts smoking and fails miserably... it all comes down to whether you have a quality build or not... no one will care if your rig was $400 cheaper because it didn't get even off the line!*

A person looking to own an electric skateboard, whether it be DIY or not, should not have to ask themselves the question of whether it will be good quality & reliable or not. The buying decision should be purely based on whether they want to build it themselves and have a faster & overall better electric skateboard or just get one in a box already built that goes a bit slower or offers less torque & range.

> **When you really think hard about it there are actually four types of electric skateboards one could own. What one do you want?** 
> 1. The ad-hock DIY electric skateboard built from scraps & retro fitted hobby parts that could catch fire at any minute?
> 2. The Premium Self Built Electric skateboard made using custom engineered high performance parts & Tuned perfectly to your riding style that will leave the others in the dust?
> 3. The out of a box "Crowd Funded" options from brand name companies such as Boosted Boards, that have slow top speed and terrible range?
> 4. The out of the box "no-name" Electric skateboards from china that look like shit with 100 year old Lead Acid batteries technology?

So hopefully now you should understand why we focus just on premium custom made gear! We realised trying to be the cheapest when it comes to electronics is a lose - lose situation. However this can be confusing for people looking to build electric skateboards at home. 


----------

So you've decided you want to build yourself an electric skateboard!
--------------------------------------------------


> **So for those stubborn readers out there thinking "I'm building it myself, surely it should still be cheaper to build my own skateboard!"**

Lets be clear!... A self built electric skateboard can be really cheap, or it can be really expensive, or it can be the same cost as the in-a-box solutions.... 

For example if you build a 4WD eboard that has a top speed of 60km/h and goes 100km on one charge with a carbon fiber deck. How much should it cost? Should it be cheaper then a Boosted board just because you build it yourself? **NO!** of course not! It will cost much more because it is much better! 

**That is the beauty of a self built electric skateboard! You can decide what it is you are creating!**

I think it is fair to say that most people when they set out to build their first ever electric skateboard at home have a tight budget & don't want to spend too much coin... Because for most people the only reason they went the DIY route in the first place is because in theory it can be done for much less than what the brand name boxed solutions cost. Makes sense right?

> **Common sense says, Why build something when you can buy one for the same price? This does not just apply to Eboards, same goes for everything in life.**


----------




Once you have decided you want an electric skateboard most people then start working out how they can get one put together for the lowest possible price! These are the common questions that one asks.
1. Whats the Best & Cheapest Motor?
2. Whats the Best & Cheapest ESC?
3. Whats the Best & Cheapest Battery?

These items above are not things that you can easily make, so the price you pay should be directly proportional to the quality, features & performance. The better stuff will naturally cost more.

**So how can you actually save money building your own E-board?**
It basically comes down to how much work you want to do yourself and if you have the tools & expertise. For instance if you decide to make your own motor mount & machine your own pulleys in your workshop you could save anywhere from $100 to $200.

Some people also make there own deck, another saving of $100 or $200.

There is an "instructable" article written explaining how to build an electric skateboard from scratch for $300 [>HERE<][5] I actually think that this guide is a bit misleading... tools & equipment cost money... glue, screws, sand paper, drill bits all cost money... & also time is money...



**The Problem** with all this talk about how much can be saved is you may end up cutting corners! Just like I did on my first ever build:
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/1X/be97075a48b9e1ad1b2c2541d5df533ca91241cd.jpg" width="179" height="500"> 

Don't laugh too hard!...  Basically I built it using stuff that was laying around & Second hand parts. I used my old skateboard, some aluminium angle & a milk crate! The result is you end up with a Frankenstein build! As you can see the battery was very exposed & when one of my mates took it for a ride he jumped down a gutter and tore a hole in my battery! There goes $120 worth of battery down the drain... The irony is that I was complaining about spending $30 on a proper components housing!...obviously I should of spent that $30! FALSE ECONOMY TRAP!!

**So please have a good long think about what you want to achieve!**

Do you think the deck you make at home is as good as one made in the factory? For some people the answer is YES! I certainly don't back myself to build a quality deck. I also don't think I could machine the motor mounting parts and get a quality result. So in many cases you may be able to justify buying some parts that are ready made to save time & get a better result.. 

The same common sense that told you to only build an electric skateboard yourself, if you can do it for less than a store bought one also plays a role when the decision is about building a complex part over the course of several days, in your workshop using raw materials VS buying that complex part and paying a higher price and having it delivered to the door.


There will be many tough **BUILD IT vs BUY IT** decisions that you need to make during the course of your eboard build. Especially now as there are a few dedicated business that specialize in selling nearly every single part you need for building an electric skateboard at home.
1. Enertion Boards.
2. DIY Electric Skateboards.
3. Alien Drive Systems.

So this is where it gets confusing!
-------------------------------
You want to build an electric skateboard because you know you can build something that is better then the store bought ones, but you don't have the tools or expertise to make any of the parts. You also want the best quality parts to make the build easy, reliable & awesome!. So you add up the cost of all the parts and realise it now costs more then the store bought one!! How did this happen? 

**Aren't DIY Electric Skateboards meant to be Cheaper?**

Because you can't build any of the things yourself & you want all the best parts your DIY eboard may actually cost more then a shop bought one! This is when people start to get nervous! This is when you risk falling into the "False Economy Trap" You go searching for cheaper parts at the hobby store & maybe save a few hundred dollars, cheaper battery, smaller motor, cheaper charger, cheaper ESC... Now your board is $150 less than buying a boosted board & your really happy! & If your lucky nothing will ever go wrong & you live happily ever after! 

BUT: What if one or two of those parts fail prematurely? your savings just went out the window and you now regret building your own in the first place... **This is the false economy. You end up spending more in the long run then if you just built it better in the beginning.** 

> **This is what all the big brand names want to happen to you, they want your crap parts to fail so that you cut your losses and go buy the pre-built solution from them....**

I personally have not ridden a boosted board, or any of the "soon-to-be-released" products born from successful crowd funding campaigns... However I have heard many complaints, the biggest complaint you get is that they are too slow, the don't have enough battery... not enough power... these are all legitimate complaints.... Most of them unfortunately are very mild in the performance department... Boring!.... that why I build my own!

I added it up the other day, from the 6 most well known crowd funded electric skateboards there was approximately $2.47 million dollars raised.... these are Boosted Boards, Inboard, mellow, Bolt, Stary & Marbel

Only Boosted has got product out there for purchase, Maybe Marbel!  & many of them are not actually available outside the USA anyway.

The biggest problem with these crowd funded solutions is they lack the performance that most DIYers can easily achieve with a self built electric skateboard of the same price. When I say performance I mostly mean these three primary attributes:
1. Top Speed
2. Range
3. Torque (acceleration & hill climbing ability)

NOTE: If you have never ridden a skateboard though, these in-a-box solutions will probably blow your mind!

Let me summarise!
-----------------
If you decide you're going to build an electric skateboard make sure you are doing it for the right reasons, don't just do it because you think its going to be cheaper, because it might not be in the long run. For me building an electric skateboard is an art form. The end result should not only be beautiful, it should be a professionally finished master piece that you can proudly announce you made yourself. It should out perform anything on the street and also look better too. It should feel better. It should be over engineered and designed to last you many years.

The self built electric skateboard is a legitimate solution, the self build eboard movement is growing stronger each day, knowledge is spreading, we are leading the way in technology & performance, its happening now, it is the future.....

Good read and agree 100% on all the points you bring up, especially about the false economy. 

Myself, am happy to spend a little more money and build things at home, just for the simple fact that I get to build a board that specifically suits me rather than a board that suits the majority.

One thing to mention about the diy companies like your enertion and DIY electric skateboards, is that it is pretty effin convenient to be able to have a chat with the business owners about there products, rather than an answering service. Being treated as a human when making an exchange has a certain feel good quality you just wont get when you are just another number in a profit margin. If possible will always support the little guy much for this reason, even if it costs a little extra.

Thanks for doing what you do mate!

I would just like to point out that when comparing to Boosted, going DIY can in fact cost you less money while giving you something that goes faster, further, and does so more reliably. Provided you don't cut corners on crap parts and do your research. 

Because for about  $1300 you can build something that whips the shit out of boosted's $1500 model, and for $900 you can build something that still whips the shit out of their $999 model and  their $1299 model, and probably even their $1500 model. Without machining parts. 

Thing is though, people hear and see DIY and think "make stuff out of junk you already have" and want it all for under $500.

And no matter what the price point is, if you want it polished with matchy colors and custom boxes you're going to have to get your hands dirty. Fabrication can get pricey, but there are ways to keep the cost down without sacrificing quality or aesthetics. It just takes some creativity and determination. 

My initial kit purchase to have a complete 6S board up and running was about $1200, and that was last year. I could probably get the same spec parts this year for a lot less and still kill the commercial competition performance wise.

I do 2000 miles a year on a $620 short board setup. To me the DIY savings is all about being able to swap and change generic components as they wear and having your choice of deck. I started with a zboard, lasted 8 weeks and the replacement parts like the esc were expensive and very unreliable. The customer service was terrible, not to mention the weight and crap form factor. I see so much cost in other builds going into double ESC, smaller motors and lower profiles.. At the end of the day i feel that's all aesthetic not performance related. Performance = lots of AMP avail form battery/ESC, high quality wheels, good motor and solid stable motor mount. A 63mm motor might look bigger in form factor but its smaller and lighter than 2 x 50mm and only requires one mount. My board out performs Boosted dramatically in every way except profile an prettiness but i'm a Mad Max influenced guy and i like my board looking and performing like it came out of Fury Road.

So I take it you quite like my first eboard design.... man that thing was cool.... it fucking hammered too.. it was built during the time NTM prop drive and Flier Electronics where reliable..

I agree with a lot of what you have said. 
My first build was an exercise in making a board as cheap as I could. I burnt up my first ESC because it was very poor quality. so I ended up buying a slightly more expensive ESC that ended up being more reliable. it was only $20 or $30 more but because I was trying to get the cheapest stuff I ended up paying a bit more. and my 2nd and 3rd and 4th builds all used the same ESC that I had upgraded on the first board. (because though my mistakes I had learned)

however the 2nd and 4th boards had less success, both frying ESC's very quickly. worth a note that the 1st and 3rd builds are still going strong with the same ESC. I can only guess that the quality control isnt great on those ESC's so its a bit hit and miss.. but the good ones are indeed good.

here's where I don't agree:
I understand that you are running a business so you are always going to say your stuff is better. fair enough. It is. I agree.
I love the parts you offer. 
but I don't like that way that you more or less say that all hobby parts are crap throughout the article.
sure they aren't as refined as your solution, but they can still be used to make a really solid e board on a budget.
I'm happy to share my failures and wins. to say that all hobby parts fail and people cover it up is a tad conspiracy theorist. 
Also different people have different needs and will tackle the same problem different ways with different results.. there is no wrong way to do it.
the spirit of DIY is to get out there and experiment. try different things. don't just follow the crowd, try something new and discover.

Thanks for the honest feedback, maybe I went a bit hard on the hobby stuff! It's not all bad especially if you are willing to make some mods or maybe get the more expensive option. I think the problem is people just always buy the cheapest option thinking it will probably be ok...

For instance:
1. Don't buy the cheapest motor, spend more & get the bigger one.
2. Don't buy the cheapest battery charger, they are crap!. Get a really good quality one because you will use it a lot!
3. The cheapest LIPO are also hit & miss. PUFF PUFF..... Maybe buy the premium ones.
4. The cheapest ESC they sell is asking for trouble....

So I definitely did mention that the hobby stores do sell more expensive, better stuff! 

[quote="onloop, post:1, topic:165"]
(note: they also have premium stuff too that is expensive)
[/quote]

One major problem that I didn't delve into with the hobby stuff is the warranty, I remember feeling like I had to invent a story about how my motor failed... because in my mind I was using stuff that was meant to go onto an RC plane - Not on an electric skateboard... I was scared that simply admitting the application which I was using the parts for would automatically void my warranty. The parts they sell technically are not meant for electric skateboards! So if they break when using it on an ESK8 the chance of getting a replacement is minimal.

Overall It is hard to articulate my point of view in a few paragraphs, We probably would need a dozen beers and a several hour sit down discussion, I guess what I am trying to say simply is for a reliable esk8 it is important to over engineer everything...so buying the cheapest items tends to end up meaning you have a system that is more likely to fail, or you cut corners which result may increase the failure rate...

If someone had of sat me down before I built my first board and told me that the way I am planning on building my board will result in destroying 2x $120 lipos, burn out multiple motors at $50 each and burnout a $150 dual controller I would have wanted to mitigate that risk.

But... In the spirit of the DIY'er I will admit that I would not have learned much without making mistakes! 

**The discussion needs to be about how reliable you can build something - not how cheap!**


So overall I think the more information that we can generate, that deeply explains the ***"meta of the eboard build"*** the better! There are lots of people who want eboards and don't know about RC gear & know nothing about skateboarding. So hopefully they can read this & learn rapidly about all the options & the risks and save some time & money by building a uber reliable rig.

That's why this forum & its members is so awesome!

Knowledge is power!

I totally agree with the above....IF performance is your be all and end all. Leave some room in your growing community for new riders/builders put aesthetics and practicality before performance...without sacrificing too much of the latter - there's a minimum! All your torquemonsters are damn impressive...but I want a board for convenience and daily use, not just drag racing. For me, that means under 6 kgs, and with no external battery, motor or wires, and a minimum of bolts, zip ties and straps. 

I'm not alone...I believe that those same two specs are sought out by the backers of Boosted, Marbel and Inboard, but not so turned on by Evolve or any other production board with fat boxy external battery. Mellow qualifies barely: although its sleek black and blue box has a look only a German could love, the fact that can literally mount it on anything probably appeals to riders who like to customize their ride right down to the color of their bushings. Sorry to be superficial, but hey, I think even most DIY controllers are hella ugly...

Back to looks and DIY: Torqueboards fat green hub motors (with endcaps), BadWolf's controller and any variety of hollow board are a step in the right direction. (for me)

Now....weight. I've only lurked on the forums and online, but never hefted any of the components physically, so I need your advice. Say with a decent-sized not crappy board (>32"ish)...what kind of performance and price would I be looking at if I set 6kg as a weight ceiling?

This is a double kicktail deck with what could be perceived as extra wood that you probably don't need. Also, its a dual motor setup with a 6S battery. It weighs in at just under 8kg and looks very polished. 

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/1X/8b1822692755552df7511b1100447add32fe61b3.jpeg" width="666" height="500"> 

drop the second motor, ESC, mounts, and pulleys, replace the 50mm motor with a 63mm, and replace the deck with something shorter in total length while providing a longer wheelbase, toss an 8S in there and fab a lightweight box slightly longer than this one and you might hit 7kg or maybe even slightly below. 

So yeah, might be possible to hit 6kg. Its definitely possible to get close enough to be happy.

Nice double kick, I too prefer to ride larger double kick short board, the ability to ollie is a benchmark for me. My last build was pretty much exactly as described above and it was a fraction over 6kg on 6S, 4 miles range. I had some problems with battery stress and the box was annoying to work with, very crammed and had to remove truck for access. The build i have now is ugly to say the least with two 6s in parallel and two enclosures but the power and hill climb ability is pretty impressive for 8kg (I'm 210 pounds 6'4"). I use welded trucks with a 63mm mount.

Hear hear for the double kick tail. That's not something you find on production boards...Probably want to their preserve their electronics by preventing you from doing tricks. Nice build though... I like where this is going. 

Is waterproofing an issue in DIY builds?

i'm only 150 pounds so this little 10Ah 6S takes me up to 12 miles while riding at around 10mph or it can take me up to about 30mph for about 5 miles. I generally fail to notice slight inclines, and actual hills it seems to handle quite gracefully.

waterproofing has been an issue for me personally. When i went from a fully enclosed metal box to the lid as seen above, i got water in the case. I have since started using clear latex caulk to seal the lid to the deck. It doesn't stick to the paint very well so it just peels off, and its cheap, so you can re-apply anytime you have to get into the box. Since I have an external charging port, i don't have to get in there unless something is wrong or i want to poke around. 

You could also fashion a gasket at the time of box creation out of a thin rubber mat of some kind. That would probably give a more polished aesthetic, especially if you could match the color to the board. It would also make working on the board easier as you don't have to mess with sealants. 

I have not tried to ollie this board but i can tell you that tail slides and launching off of curbs as high as a foot tall are absolutely no problem. Doing a nose manual while hitting the accellerator and letting the wheels spin is also fun to watch. I can pretty easily do a 180 tail slide too and totally change direction on a moment's notice, giving me a much smaller effective turn radius which is handy in urban areas. 

welded motor mounts are probably where i go next. @torqueboards has some really nice ones on Paris trucks and honestly i feel like the fewer screws and bolts involved in a rig the better.

Also forgot to mention: Enertion's motors are treated to be waterproof, but honestly i'm running NTM 270s and they have been splashed to hell and back and even saturated without presenting any issues at all. YMMV.

Why doesn't someone build a lid insert for the ABS for water proofing? Also how does one keep ESC cool in ABS?
For welded I buy the mount from DIYelectricskateboard ($30) and have it welded to Paris trucks ($10 at a local welder who  is cool), so for about $65 i get a pretty light and very strong mount and truck. I find the hardest thing about tricks is not squeezing the accelerator as you ollie, it's natural for me too flinch my hands as I go into the ollie.

This build is only 7kg. It feels really light. Most of my previous builds have been over 8kg. For some reason 7kg feels like nothing.

It also super neat & tidy.

The heavy part is the battery and motors.

If I used a small battery and single motor it could be closer to 6kg. Maybe under.

These hub motors are about 880grams each. A 6355 satellite motor, mount & wheel is about 1180grams.

I don't think a single hub motor is suitable. Unkess you weight 60kg. So you would need satellite config.

Like this. But just one motor.

I actually don't know the true history of evolve and the technology they are using.... so i can only speculate.

This is what I *think* about evolve. (just my opinion based on observations)

They are a company that started out selling Chinese-mass-made electric skateboards. Over time they spent some money on custom molds to help differentiate their product from the ever increasing glut of identical made-in-china electric skateboards that flooded the market.

Through quality marketing campaigns & a solid branding strategy PLUS a slightly more refined product they have been able to become very successful. I think the carbon board and the partnership with other brand name skate suppliers (Bustin boards & MBS wheels) was critical to their ongoing success, they might actually be one of the biggest brands in the world for electric skateboards today...  

**>  However, the fact of the matter is EVOLVE are still 1st generation technology**

If they don't keep innovating they will get left behind.
- 18650 battery tech
- brushless outrunners
- dual motors
- hub motors
- higher top speeds

They did just release an iphone/android app which does show that they are still working to stay relevant, However i think they wasted their money... personally i think iPhone apps for eboards are a gymick and the user base will always be low... iPhone & apps don't make skateboarding any better its basically a me-too strategy so they look like they are gen 2.

anyway... below is my evidence that makes me draw to the conclusion that they are just reselling a Chinese solution (perhaps a slightly more refined version) that several other electric skateboard brands also have. In my opinion, and why i think they all suck, is they are way too heavy for the performance they deliver.. Why have such a big fucking motor hanging off your trucks?

Ask yourself this question, if you are an electric skateboard company that (claims) to of built your electric skateboard product from the ground up & developed all the tech yourself why do so many look identical? if your are an innovator your product will be unique in the market.

- I consider most of the crowd funded campaigners as 2nd generation.
- Ultimately its the DIYers who keep pushing the boundaries and will probably be responsible for all new innovations & eventually the 3rd generation of eboards.

Sorry to be superficial again, but dang those boards are ugly. No matter what their performance, ya gotta agree that the gen 2s -  the Kickstarters - all look like just normal longboard. No boxes bolted on, no B.F.M. (as Onloop eloquently expressed) hanging off the back (so THAT's what a kicktail is supposed to be for ;-)).

It's not actually the battery... its the ESC that has the heat sink! I assume they need it Because the ESCs are very low tech... i suppose the mosfets are tiny & underspec'd, so they must run fairly hot.... heat is generated from inefficiency. 

The vesc is a perfect example of how Open Source DIY tech is leading the way... it runs so cool the mosfets don't need any heat sink at all... rarely would they reach 80 degrees and that's without heat sink... of course it you start pushing it with high amps it might warm up a little bit more...  but it is extremely over engineered so that doesn't happen.

Well my cheap boards made it two years without issue. HK LiPos, HK150A ESCs (ditched the fans) and HK SK3 motors. Due to smart gearing I haven't had a single issue ... Until I put on a new 3D printed case, did some rewiring and stupid managed to flick or drip solder onto the under side of my ESCs ... poof. I still have no idea how that happened but I think I would still be going if not for that. 

So I got about 2000km, as light a dual Boosted for under $700 AUD - doesn't seem like false economy to me :smile:

But now they are dead and I can get VESC for the same price as a HK150A I will have switched with the next release. Looking forward to the improvements it supposedly will bring.

I think it can work with hobby parts, but it's not always the case if you're looking at it from a quality perspective. And it's even becoming worse. I'm using them myself and it's ok until now.

But there is another point about the hobby parts: they were never intended to be used for human transportation. Nobody who developed those parts was ever assuming that people are going to sit or even stand on a RC car setup! Of course it works with some tricks, but at the end I am risking my live when parts fail on high speed or with traffic around me.

So that's the reason for my new project: an eBoard with no hobby parts and specifically designed for my purpose of ebording. There are solutions out there where hobby parts have been strengthened to cope with the aim to use them for skateboarding and Jason is part of this too. That's going to be more expensive of course - but that's worth it if it's affecting my (or my kids) health. 

We are still in the at the beginning of this journey and maybe at a point where eBikes were some 15 years ago...

@elkick the Irony is that NONE of these parts are actually designed to be on skateboards.
so you say that you are making a build with no hobby parts. but as you say all the parts sold for e-boards are just higher spec hobby parts.

the fact that we use outrunners on every board is testament to this. idealy we wouldnt want the can to spin. (i know outrunners are currently the best for the job,) but a compact and solid inrunner would be much better in terms of dirt contamination and mounting options.
and the VESC is a mild exception. it has been designed around being able to handle the electrical current and needs of a skateboard. so yes logicaly its designed for skateboard, but physically.. its an SMD PCB! these are never going to withstand the shock and vibration of a board. Ideally it needs to be mounted inside a sold resin block or something. ( hmm maybe i'll do that)

Don't take this the wrong way I'm not saying that the skateboard products are bad.
I'm this saying this "designed for hobby" or "designed for skate" talk is a bit crap. they are one in the same. (albeit improved spec)

I still think this blows everything out of proportion..

IMO RC Parts are a perfect solution for a DIY Electric Skateboard.

What do you guys think all these production boards have... Similar RC Hobby Parts sure they are spec'd for electric skateboards.

But there's a reason why we use RC parts.. Simply because they are much smaller and have a ton of power and they have been the best solution for the job.

There's no need to slap an 80mm motor to an electric skateboard or use a motor just because it's not an RC motor.

My first board 6374 SK3 motor has lasted well over 2000 miles and is still kicking... I doubt that motor will ever die on me. This is with 2 set screws only and no keyway.. The entire shaft doesn't even sit through the entire pulley. It climbs 30% inclines, the setup never gets hot and it runs well.

**If your parts are dying, your setup is just inefficient (incorrect gearing, not enough power, not enough motor, stressing the setup too much, going cheap, trying to climb 30% inclines with your single motor, letting your setup cog.)**

Boosted is using similar motors, Marbel is using similar motors, Inboard, etc.

An RC motor is simply a BLDC outrunner motor.. Just because it's used for RC doesn't mean that it's not capable of the weight and stress of a human body.

We're also using large airplane 50mm and 63mm motors and these large airplane's aren't little.

The main benefit to purchasing a Electric Skateboard purposed motor is simply the benefit of a motor sole purpose to be used for an electric skateboard. Longer motor shafts, Longer key ways, better bearings, better rotors things that you won't find on a typical RC hobby motor because they don't need it.

But if the price isn't too far off.. All those benefits/features are well worth the cost considering if you got it machined it would cost you the same price + time + headache + probably a lot more than just buying it outright.

**So IMO, RC Parts are great for DIY Electric Skateboard on a budget but if you can afford the cost. RC parts specifically made for a DIY Electric Skateboard are well worth the cost.**

**Buying decision should be based on benefits analysis** 

Pros & Cons is the most logical approach:

**PROS OF CUSTOM MADE ESK8 PARTS**

 1. Easy installation, time is money.
 2. Tried & Tested, less garage time - more riding!
 3. Standardisation, best practice solutions become mainstream.
 4. Better warranty & product support.
 5. Over time, due to economy of scale, prices will actually lower.
 6. Products made with fail safe features. Such as; Fuses, Current Limiting, Battery Management Systems, low voltage cut off, high voltage cutoff, temperature sensors, rpm limits.
 7. High voltage (hobby ESC stops at 6S). More torque, lower amps, less heat, better for battery longevity - High voltage has no real disadvantages.
 8. Slimmer components (batteries & esc). There is limited space under a skateboard. To avoid scraping components on ground.
 9. Asthetics, custom parts allow you to make a better looking home built board.
 10. Eventually will be plug & play. Modules that just attach & go.


**CONS OF CUSTOM MADE ESK8 PARTS**

 1. Higher cost.
 2. Limited availability.
 3. Limited choices.
 4. Few supplier's.
 5. Online purchase only. (Some people like shops)
 6. Some parts (Vesc) require some knowledge to program and setup...  eventually will be plug and play though.

@onloop I have to disagree with some of your points. I don't mean this to shoot your points down but I think a lot of them really depend on perspective. 

On the pros:
1. Hobby stuff has been dead easy. No custom firmware installs, no VMs, little to no troubleshooting for my motors
2. There are lots of boards running on loads of ESCs .. there is more experience in the community on running hobby stuff. This custom stuff is new, not tried and tested (except by a privileged few) and I think how terrible I found Alien stuff to be for my circumstances (very hilly area) is testament to such issues.
3. See 2 ... eventually but not initially
4. For 2 years I've been promised a replacement/upgrade from APS/Bruno. This has everything to do with suppliers and little to do with product. I had no problem sending back a defective Hobbyking (yes HK not HW) ESC.
5. Economies of scale rarely exist in hobbyist/custom products. Just as you hit it, the market saturates because it's rather niche.
6. This is a true area advantage .. purpose built.
7. I have no problem with 6S because I already have a boatload of torque ... I want a skateboard not a weapon. Speed demons will disagree.
8. Your battery back is way too big and heavy for me ... my new VESC (should they ever come) should be a little bit smaller than my existing trimmed down HK150A ESCs.
9. Unlikely ... I print nice 3D printed enclosures for my gear that looks better than anything I can get on the market. I also quite like some of the HK/HW enclosures on Thingiverse and  the like - I think they look far better than the discrete box styling of yours and other custom gear.
10. Eventually isn't a pro until it happens. Hobby stuff is plug and play. I bought ESC, batteries and motors for my first board and was going without lifting a soldering iron. 

On your cons:
1. I bought two new VESCs from your because two new HK ESCs come with way less features for nearly the same price. I think you're already competitive on this particular point.
2. Yup ... Still waiting on those VESCs

Yes higher voltage gives more torque and for many people is not really needed.

But actually one of the main reasons to run higher voltage is to lower peak amp draw.

At 6S it is much easier to over heat the electronics.

So in the long run I chose 10S to improve parts longevity and minimise the risk of failure. Reliability is a major focus for me.

@onloop 2 Years on the same 6S budget ESC ... that is pretty good reliability and only brought to an end by some rushed soldering. You are right that less Amps reduces a pile of issues but 10S is the point at which the Voltage also becomes risky such that at one of my workplaces my skateboard would not be allowed on premises without being sparky certified (above 36V).

So, are you saying VESC is going to struggle with the Amps on 6S? 1.5KW sustained seems fine to me (50A * 4.2V * 6cells). I think the C rating of cells is the bigger issue.

I have been trying to get my head around this statement for a while now.  I just can't see how a higher voltage could possibly lower peak Current.

edit: wait I just got it. You need to change the motor!
here I am trying to do mathematical equations at 4am and I was working with the same load!
in order to lower the current you need to raise the load (ie change to a different motor) I was trying to work it out based on just adding a bigger battery to the existing motor. (it doesn't work. in fact it does the opposite)

[quote="roller, post:44, topic:165"]
So, are you saying VESC is going to struggle with the Amps on 6S? 1.5KW sustained seems fine to me
[/quote]

Well i was not really referring to the VESC, I was just saying in general that higher voltage (10s or 12s) & lower current is better on an eboard. 

however in relation to the VESC, it is actually more efficient to use higher voltage. The VESC was designed with components that support up to 60V, these components & VESC work better with higher voltage. 

If you are going with 6S on VESC you should change the MOSFETS to the lower voltage ones as they have lower resistance. Also, the parts are slightly cheaper if you build a VESC for max 40V

I did consider building with 6S as i could build cheaper eboards, but in the long run i want maximum efficient, low current, low heat.... this way i can build better eboards.

if you have two eboards that peak at say 1000Watts

if one is a 6S battery you have motor current of 45amps
if one is a 10S Battery you have a motor current of 27amps

higher voltage has same power output with lower current, less heat, better for battery health, more efficient etc.

this is a big advantage.

Higher voltage increases motor RPM, so you will need to change the gearing ratio to keep the top speed the same, more reduction!. Or just get a motor with a lower KV.

Well there is no chance of different MOSFETs now as I already ordered my VESCs a month ago. Just waiting desperately on the promised 1st week of October delivery so I can get riding again. As you raise the point of 10S and gearing this is another reason I wouldn't use 10S. I can't go any smaller on my motor pulley. There is not much room to go too much bigger on my wheel pulley plus I really don't want to go through other the expense to buy or the time to CNC up another set and I'm about as low as we can go with KV. So these late VESCs better be worth the wait.

Yeah. It is worth noting that if you just up the battery and DO NOT change the load (i.e. motor or gearing) you will INCREASE the current.
so if your plan is to go 10S battery to reduce Amps but not increasing your load by changing the motor, you will do the opposite! Peak Amps will be Higher.

(thats where I was confusing myself the other day)

@onloop, it's always great to wait two weeks longer than promised at no extra charge. 

@lowGuido, You are missing a piece of the puzzle in your thinking. If you increase your voltage (i.e. go 10S) but keep the same load on a simple fixed load (resistance) circuit then the current would increase as per V=IR. But a motor/ESC is not a fixed load ... it's variable and you vary it to do a certain amount of work i.e. pushing us along happily at 30km/h. To do the same instantaneous work you need the same power ... power is the result of current x voltage (P=IV). In other words as the voltage goes up the current comes down for the same power output. Did that makes sense?
```

its changing all the time. thats why its so hard to pin down. but less load will always equal more current.

(especially if you raise the voltage)

also in your example you take power as a constant (which it isn't.) which Is why i state PEAK current will be higher.

edit: also worth noting that onloop's original quote also said peak.

I also want to point out that nobody is wrong here. its just a very difficult thing to explain without very complicated maths.

Just to add to the discussion - I presume in a case like this, it would be the duty cycle changing (lower duty cycle for a higher V, everything else equal). @roller did indicate a particular power output in the context of achieving a given speed. Sure, power output over time isn't constant for either system, but to attain the same speed (or kinetic energy produced by the work done), the power output of the motors should be the same, assuming ideal components and all that. There are certainly second order electronic issues, at least, that complicate things.

Of course, it is correct that the peak current in the higher-V system is larger, but the power output, and hence speed, is also higher. Like you said, though, onloop did say peak. 

He also said 

[quote="onloop, post:47, topic:165"]
if you have two eboards that peak at say 1000Watts

if one is a 6S battery you have motor current of 45ampsif one is a 10S Battery you have a motor current of 27amps
[/quote]

I know what he meant by that, but just to clarify things in my own mind: From what I've read on Vedder's site, my understanding is that these numbers would actually be the battery current, due to a less-than-100% duty cycle in the motors (to achieve the same 1000W - the 10S could push more). Whereas, the motors receive the full I = V/R current for the portions of the duty cycle they are being powered. Does this sound right?

@emotiva I was trying to keep it simple to explain to @lowGuido the current would be lower not higher in at least half the circuit... as you say into the ESC. Coming out of the ESC is a pulse and really that is much more complicated to break down. The main point is that you can't simplify it to a V=IR or that plain amps really as much at that point.

the point I was trying to make with this article is if you buy the cheapest of everything you might NOT end up with a high-quality build.. it could fail and you might need to replace parts. therefore not saving much money.

I think it's a valid point... 

the first build i made i was on a VERY TIGHT budget... i bought the cheapest stuff i could find. Did it save me money in the long run? NO!!, because things broke. chargers didn't work, batteries swelled up, ESC's failed...

the beauty of DIY is it's up to you! you can ignore my advice and choose your own path.. in fact i would prefer everyone buys the cheap stuff first and learns about building an eboard and increases their knowledge without so much coin on the table....

people learn much more from their own mistakes.. I simply tried to articulate what i learned from making the mistakes i made...

There is a point to how cheap you can purchase. You can most definitely purchase off the shelf for most items and you don't need to buy anything but the motor mounts, escs.

Not everything is worth spending high dollar value.

My first board ran like a champ and is still running with no issues of failing. RC Lipos, SK3 motors from HobbyKing and of course I've switched out the ESCs here and there but motors tend to last forever unless you cut or ruin the wires and/or magnets fall off but that's slim to none even with hobby king motors. I find them highly reliable.

Want a cheap setup... more then enough people have tried a single motor on 6S battery + 230-245kv for 20mph. Can't go wrong and if anything messes up you can replace it. If you want throw in a VESC and you can upgrade to a 12S.

@torqueboards is right on all counts. A single drive 6S is still plenty of fun. My personal ride is running a single 270kv propdrive on a 14 month old 6S lipo using one of his $70 6S ESCs at the moment and its still plenty fast and fun. Normally its a dual drive setup but one of the ESCs was bad right out of the box so i had to return it and now i'm waiting on my replacement.

@torqueboards, @onloop my experience is just the same as Torqueboards ... off the shelf hobbyking  SK3 and even ESC ran really well for me. I dabbled in Alien ESCs but they were rubbish but not as rubbish as their service (Bruno has been promising to send me a replacement for 2 years). The only thing that killed my cheap "junk" was some idiot (yes, me) soldering parts while it was live. I just can't wait to try the VESC upgrade because my only complaint with the HK150A was I couldn't soft start and I had to give that first kick. Not a big deal for me but always thought it was a nice to have. The HK150A SK3 combo certainly had the best braking on any board I've tried so far, commercial or hobby built.

To be honest I found the waiting the most painful thing about going for the VESC. I ordered in September and didn't get VESCs until after I left the country in late November. So I have to say that if the best board is the one that you quickly have working then the cheap hobby setup wins hands down and investing in pricier, purpose built solutions with a slow turnaround is a less desirable experience... as for the total cost of ownership you talk of, it cost me more waiting patiently in bus fares to commute to work and uni than going through two sets of HK150As would have. 

Looking forward to finally getting onto my VESCs when I get home in mid Jan.

I must say...I come from the RC airplane and Multi-Rotor world, where a lot of the concepts of ESC's and electronics have parallels with the Electric Skateboard world. Building a Skateboard is totally in my wheelhouse! Company's like Enertion and Alien, and just the sheer amount of info being shared here in this board make the idea of DIY so appealing. But when I look at the cost of building vs. buying a factory built board, the cost difference is negligible. Unless I was building for the sheer purposes of learning or for fun, I don't see much of an incentive to build otherwise. Going through the high end components at Enertion RC, the dual motor kit is 565.19, the space cell battery pack is 353.70, two of the new VESC controllers (old one is out of production) will be 344.22, the remote is 49.01 and a Loaded Icarus deck is $205, that brings me to $1516.12. Meanwhile, a production Evolve Bamboo GT is $1489.00 free shipping to the US. Add to that the resale value to the casual end user, (when the time comes to upgrade) and it's hard to make the argument (as is claimed on the Enertion site), that you can save "heaps" building an Electric Board yourself. Anyone else weighing this decision right now?

The best thing about building your own is you get to choose what parts go into your skateboard. You might want big wheels, short deck & mega motors.

You could build one for $400 or $4000

Its about choice
Its about the act of creation
Its about style
Its about art

However, if none of those things are important & if you are time poor and money rich, I think you should buy a complete.

I totally get the customization thing! I really appreciate all you've done with Enertion as well! It's not so much about being time poor, it's a performance value/resale quotient. It's my own mind's idea that DIY should end up saving me much more money than it does (without going directly to China for parts). 

I like to create too, but to me that would be in building the board itself. The deck to me is the most creative thing on a skateboard. Everything else is engineering which is WAY outside my wheelhouse! Let's say the Evolve Bamboo GT is 1489.00 US. If I build a comparable board: 2 motors with trucks wheels and mounts: 565, dual vescs 342.88, battery: 352 with the remote now I believe. add a nice deck at at-least $205. How much did I spend: 1464.88. 

It doesn't make sense to build vs. purchasing an Evolve or your co.'s or similar (not Boosted for range limits) unless you go for low end components. Which is outside of your very praised quality-mantra any how. 3000w motors, high end propriertary vesc, remote with optical feedback, long range battery, nice deck...you see my argument. Build if you want the experience and the bespoke (to the degree you don't buy a pre-made deck) board. Otherwise, I can see the DIY route actually costing you more, in time and money. Plus, it seems to me it's easier to sell when the next upgrade comes out. A turnigy SK3 motor at 75 bucks, a cheap deck at 50 bucks, 27$ caliber trucks, $50 wheels, $20 bearings and spacers, 60 bucks for an off the shelf motor mount,  20 dollar rc car controller, 30 spektrum receiver, some sort of hobby esc or an 80 dollar vesc and a couple cheap turnigy lips at $60...sure. Looking at $472. Is it high quality? Is it an apples to apples machine component wise?

Here is where I am now.  After waiting months for the Nano -x and planning to build our summer project before Christmas I have no idea how to connect the nano-x receiver to the VESC-standard?

I would make a build thread as well as look at what others have done on the forum- this thread is somewhat off topic from your actual problems.

I order to connect the receiver to the VESC, you will need a standard 3 pin servo cable; it likely came with the remote, but if not, it is a $2 cable to can buy from a local hobbyshop, amazon, etc. 

You will then need to set up the VESC in the BLDC tool on your computer- all of this is outlined on various threads here on the forum, so I would just recommend using the search bar feature and reading up on similar situations to your own.

Caden

Thanks so much.  After watching a few more videos I got that impression.  The nano-x controller has 3 sets of 3 pin connections, Bind, ch1, and ch2.  The instructions say binding is done automatically when you connect via channel 1 to the VESC.  So it’s just the three large pins that come off the VESC, the mico USB is for connecting to PC for the BLDC process, but there is also a 4 pin and an 6 pin connector that I have no idea what they are for.  Also, how do I know which wire goes to which pin on the receiver and the Vesc.  Hate to fry something right out of the gate.

Hi everyone, I live up at the University of Vermont, a very hilly area and i'm looking to build my first electric longboard this summer. I weigh around 200 lbs and have to be able to carry a backpack with books and my laptop and such as well so budget around 220 lbs. I'm on a pretty tight budget and would really like to stay under $350-$400. With my weight and the hilly area I understand that a dual motor setup would be the best in terms of torque and efficiency. Does anyone in a similar situation have suggestions for parts for the build? I already have a deck from a sector 9 longboard.

On a budget I would use a single 6374 190kv motor on a really wide 10s pack, like 10s5p or better so you have plenty of amps.  Look through the builds (#e-board-builds) thread, you'll find lots of info.

I would recommend Using Lipos they have high discharge and don't cost a lot.
So keep your eyes peeled for sales at hobbyking.

I agree with @mmaner

So the recommendation is a Big motor with a High amperage battery. 
(A high Amperage battery is key for hill climbs and torque.)

I also considered building my own battery with 18650 cells to save some cash, I didn't think that a single motor would work all that well from what I've looked into so far and that they might heat up too much on some bigger hills  but I'll do some more research, also forgot to mention I want to be able to hit about 20-25 mph. Thanks for the feedback though @mmaner and @Blitz

As a new member, doing research. This entire page needs to be updated and preferably remove the false equivalencies & crap talking. I read this entire thread and didn't learn anything about electric skateboards except that enertion writes incredibly egocentric articles.

Edit: All of what was said could have been true in 2015

Fully agree with you Marcus. Newbie here too. It's been 3 years and there has been a huge improvement in preassembled boards and esk8 tech in general. Young Chinese entrepreneurs are realising that shit components at lowest cost is not what the rest of the world wants anymore, and brands like Wowgo, Meepo, TeamGee, Ownboard, Verreal, all make decent consumer grade boards now. So if I were Enertion, I'd edit the trash talking post (would've been true in 2015,but it's 2018 now yo) so he doesn't make himself look like an idiot.

With that being said, I do agree with the general thesis of the post and appreciate the time and effort taken to write this. Cheers and happy building.

LOVE the article. I just went hog wild on my first build! I spent about 600 for lipo chargers, 2 5S 30C batteries, a ESC and a dual hub motor build as a small first build. I plan to later build a much nicer board but I wanted to do a prof of concept to get my feet wet with this hobby. if all go's well with this first build I will deffently be planning a bigger build. I do have a go big or go home type montra but I always want to take it slow building up to my idea. anyways hope to get to know more of you guy's well and learn more about eskate!

Hi everybody,

I am new here, it was nice to read your contributions.

As a lot of riders, I am looking for a board.
to complete DIY vs pre-build way to reach this goal, did you try alternative as group buying or second hand?

Do you know if some vendor/shop get refurbished marketplace?

I am living in Europe, and plan to buy a board.
currently, 3 options are shortlisted: Bioboards, DIY (direct drive), Evolve (alphabetic order).

One is black-listed, but as I do not plan to go into looping discussion, I will blank their id. 

Do you think that some riders from Europe (Please do not see any restriction, but as this project will my first group buying experience also, I prefer to be on the same ground for shipping, if someone gets experience with worldwide, let go) would take into consideration a group buying as [https://groupgets.com](https://groupgets.com/) or another site?

Hi, I think this depends on how much money you want to spend and how much time and if any, are u willing to spend on diy build.

Otherwise I would maybe better get Lacroix board, if shipping cost is not very big for getting it from US to EU.

Interesting concept about groupbuys..

Though, I think there should be some more options to choose from.. especially if u are in top tier board segment..

Personally still dont know if new GTR evolve board is up to spec considering battery, even if their remotes seem to be upgraded by now

Welcome man ! In my humble opinion, you may want to look at Metroboard instead of Evolve.

Have you seen their last X model ? It's no more bulky and looks good. The brand has good reputation, where for Evolve I personally can't trust a brand who thinks riders are test dummies and who doesn't even care about reliability (it's easier to shut bad feedback down).

Ask @longhairedboy what he thinks about it, he knows better than most on the matter.

Bioboards are road monsters too, and DIY... Well you've come to the right place for that :beers: what exactly do you seek ?

http://www.enertionboards.com/open-source-electric-skateboard-motor-mount/

is 404 is there new location?

Yes, i realize necropost, but its a pinned topic, and open source is open source, so open source does imply an ongoing obligation... but mostly just curious as it seems there's plenty of other options :D

open source is admirable and desirable.

Dude said in his original post that HK DOES have premium components but people trying to save a buck by going hobby route typically end up buying the cheapest and meet the false economy.

Throwing shade at particular companies porbably isnt the best look though.
