I'm writing a "Danger manual" to go with my boards. If you aren't in my head already, a danger manual is that stupid little booklet you throw away that's filled with bad english and warnings. It comes with new products, and most people only use it to find a number to complain to. 

My danger manual will be different. 

I wanted something nice that won't get thrown away, but instead left on the coffee table or laughed over with friends. I'm doing the whole thing myself and its going to be filled with angry squirrels and esk8 porn and illustrations. 

but most importantly, it needs to cover the basics. So far, it covers the following information which is spread out across a few topical chapters:

* wearing a helmet and gear and where to get it if you're clueless
* getting comfortable with your new board in private before going public and streeting a face. 
* accelerating and braking, giving yourself room to stop, etc
* when riding in public, things to do and not do, etc, and also a lot of notes about minding animals. 
* when riding at night, lights, visibility and awareness, etc
* general care and maintenance
* avoiding water
* charging and storage
* how to use the remote
* things to check before you ride, belts, bolts, all that shit
* how to behave when people react, a reminder that esk8s are still strange to others
* warranty and refund policy
* coping with jealousy
* a couple dozen pages of full color esk8 porn of actual customer builds
* info on parts and upgrades
* a reminder to enjoy yourself

So what i want to ask you guys is if there are any areas that i may not have mentioned that you think i probably should mention. 

I'm probably going to send it to the printers this week.

The tone of the manual is very tounge-in-cheek and self aware, so that might be fun as long as i was carful with it and gave very clear consequences for doing so.

That is a huge part of it. Thank you for bringing that up. I mention in several places to not be a dick and fuck it up for the rest of us.

I actually go a step further in the "riding in public" section and mention about how people react strangely to things they don't understand, and we need to be considerate of that. when somebody sees something weird, and their dog is hating it already, they're likely to say something awkward. People need to be considerate when that happens and not "be dildos", as Skwisgaar would say.

Make it an actual religion and if you piss people off and they pass laws banning my way of life because of you, then you go underground forever in a place that's rather warm.

Then also you can claim tax-free status for your garage.

[/quote]

unfortunately humans are born selfish, egotistical animals so further detail about what constitutes dickery is often required, and on top of that, it has to be eased into or you offend them. But then oddly enough if you do that and then swear a lot and draw some squirrels it becomes amusing enough to not throw away.

This is something over looked by the public very often: legal restrictions on motorized skateboards. Specifically the max speed and power. From the looks, your esk8(not picking on you, this includes most of our and mine :kissing_heart:) could potentially(unrestriction by design) break the legal speed(20mph) and power(1kw) limit.

    Lets break down the California Electric Skateboard Law AB - 604! General Discussion

    There seems to be some confusion in the community as to what the recently passed California law is on electric skateboards. So I will break it down in great detail and give you commentary on it so we are all on the same page. 
First, you need to understand one thing: “electrically motorized boards” and “motorized skateboards” are 2 different things in law. California already has laws dating back to the late 70’s that ban motorized skateboards. Prior to this law, there was no definition of electr…

Plus, some areas also have vague rules on the streets against esk8’s.

That's only for one state.  In Cali, most esk8 on the market are illegal.  Vote accordingly.  And buy the ones that are legal.  And for the rest of us, know your local laws

@longhairedboy When I talk to people about riding I teach them about viewing the riding conditions in cycles from the forefront to the background. You have to have a short view (what’s right in front of my wheels?) and a long view (what’s ahead and to the sides of me?) without staring in one spot. It’s a skill. Not sure if I’m explaining it properly here.

4. Going off road on your esk8. Is it a good idea? 

5. Attempting tricks/stunts/jumps on your esk8, and other ways to accidentally destroy it. 

6. Safety gear, what safety gear is acceptable, and what safety gear is awesome.

7. Potholes, kerbs and your esk8 - why they don’t mix.

Semi-serious question here- is this intended more for esk8 riding or is it aimed at building as well? 
Building is whole world in itself, with a lot of different skills and other info you need to know _as a builder_, but someone who just wants to ride wouldn't need.

Thanks guys for all the feedback. 

@treenutter i know exactly what you're talking about, and i think i'm going to see if i can work that in. That concept is definitely worth a mention

@High-roller  I like that idea, if i find a few choice quotes before i have to send it off i will squeeze them in.

@baxter all excellent ideas, most of which are covered already. potholes and curbs are something i should mention explicitly i think. thanks!

There's one PSA I could've used in my early days, and the remotes you use may not suffer this, but I've learned to be mindful of overcorrections with throttle inputs when I've experienced a signal drop or interference at certain locations.  Those delayed inputs can get through and catch you off guard.  When the board is acting weird, best to get off and test throttle response with wheels off the ground.

This is what I was thinking of, my Dad's best friend had one when I was a kid.  He used to let me drive it when I was 10 or 11 on an abandoned airport runway.  I would regularly hit 130 and scare the ever loving shit out of him :).  Probably where my love of speed came from.

@Blitz  Thanks! i did add something to that affect. That's something i think is important. I also laid out in clear terms that acting a fool is going to ruin it for everyone. 

So, everyone, I would really like to thank you for this. Most of your ideas were brilliant, some of them i had already included, all of them were very very much appreciated and i just wanted to thank all of you for helping me. 

The danger manual is now at the printers!

I have 50 coming in the first batch and I am planning on making it available to everyone. Most of the first batch will be mailed out to my previous custom board customers. I will also be selling it a-la-carte as well as making it part of a sticker and t-shirt bundle, and it will likely end up being a free gift for purchases over a certain amount as well. 

It was not expensive to make and i will not charge fortune for it, so don't worry. You will have one for your coffee table if you want it, i promise. It was, however, a lot of time and effort, all of which was fun!

I was thinking somewhere in the realm of $9 plus shipping, or maybe $10 with free shipping if ordered a la carte. 

I am open for an appendix or additional content for it if you guys keep coming up with good ideas.

Solid matte black with my sticker on the front. Because i want it to arrive the same way fucking expensive ass perfume would because i'm a goddamned diva.

i'm pretty sure that's an option. Standard USPS international is way cheaper. Its also likely to get lost, and has no tracking once it leaves the US, and no guaranteed deliver window, so who knows if or when it would get there, but it is an option. 

BTW i'm fulfilling these myself, out of my garage directly from the box that came from the printers. I'm not drop shipping them from some publisher or whatever. I'm literally self published. I pack the little black envelopes and put my own sticker on every one, print a label, and stick it on there myself. That means i'm subject to less than optimal shipping rates. 

I still don't deal with the volume necessary to get DHL or somebody to take me seriously, even with all the retail and boards and evolve mods. I may at some point try releasing it through Amazon which would likely make international orders a lot less expensive.

when riding in public, things to do and not do, etc, and also a lot of notes about minding animals.
[/quote]

In this section please focus on public relations.  Like: smile at everyone, talk to everyone and if there are small children around go no more than 2mph faster than the children are going.  Dogs, horses, etc. crawl past them.  

I get a ton of cred by putting kids (in a helmet and) on the board and keeping control of the remote while they ride about 4 mph.  They love it, their parents love it and little chance of them getting hurt.

This sport will live or die by the respect and friendliness we eSk8ers show for other users of the trail.
