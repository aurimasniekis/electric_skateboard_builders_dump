This is the Predator Boards Banshee, a 12.5lbs Carbon Fiber electric cruiser with a top speed of 25mph and a range of 12-16 miles. Thanks to the unibody construction, this board is completely weather sealed, so rain won't fuck over the electronics. Looking forward to you guys's thoughts.

So the motors themselves are waterproof 83mm swappable urethane hub motors. The battery is a 10S2P Samsung 30Q battery pack. At a nominal voltage of 37V, that gives it a capacity of 222 watt hours. The battery pack can discharge at a rate of 1400W-1600W continuous. No exaggeration, no burst.

@Touch415 Oh damn, I'm an idiot. So from personal testing (I don't trust jack shit from my manufacturer's representative) I found the board can climb 15-20% inclines with a 150lbs load. With Chinese batteries, forget about it. With the Samsung 30Qs, it's doable. I'm hesitant to rip open my current prototype until we get some photo ops, but here are the insides of the first prototype with the Chinese batteries.

We are using a dual ESC. Perhaps we can do VESCs in the future (I damn hope) but right now we have to run with the stock ESC that the manufacturer has. Although I'm fighting tooth and nail for revisions, that's the one part they won't budge on üòê

So I want to be as transparent as possible and say upfront we are using Winboard as our current manufacturer. The ESC they are using is similar, but definitely exclusive to them. If I had to guess why they are resistant to changing, it's because they need to move their inventory. Pisses me off, but we need sales to get them to make changes.<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/f/c/fc0aa1b08248335a56c82c67bcfa0cc88b954084.JPG" width="375" height="500">

hummm how can you say the pack will discharge at 1600watts with 10s2p and 30Q?   Even if you assume the better discharge rate of 20amps a cell with those..thats 40 amps times 37 volts and 740 watts max.

40a x 37V gives you 1480W. Hence why I said the projected discharge is somewhere around 1400W-1600W

1'400-1'600w Continuous? I know vapers say that the 30Q is actually a "20A Battery" but won't it be better to use manufacturer's specifications of 15A constant instead? Still, that's 1'110w which isn't that bad :stuck_out_tongue:

The 30Q isn't better when it comes to voltage sag and capacity. Volume and weight is another story.

The specs sound really nice. I like that it is so light and still performs well. Probably mostly from the smaller batt pack and lighter deck. For the range test, in what type of conditions was it tested to reach 12miles. 

Since it is a smaller board, do you end up putting your feet over the front trucks? Does that give you more control?

My first board is actually from Winboard (W3). But I didn't get to test the ESC that much. Once I got it, I did only a few test to make sure it worked and opened it up to see what was inside. After that the ESC started to fail intermittently. I could have damaged it after when I opened it, so it may not have been a quality issue.

like the look of the deck but wonder how it rides.  any in san francisco soon?
i'm finding "full carbon" , as often stated, is carbon around foam and rides not as nicely as wood.  

can the esc do foc or you have plans for that ?

Sorry to hear about the ESC. So you brought up an interesting point, the deck itself is 28" in length and had a wheelbase of 20", which I found too unstable to ride comfortably at 25mph. So we increased the wheelbase to 23". With that increased length, you can pretty much place your feet anywhere on the deck without fear of pulling an accidental wheelie or stoppie when you apply power.

Prototype:

In terms of testing, I tested around mostly flatland with some key 10% hills that I traverse at least 5 times on a casual day. After all was said and done, the range came out to somewhere around 14 miles with a heavy throttle hand. Do note I am pretty lightweight at 120lbs.

Don't worry, I don't care for fluff. The deck's composition is indeed a carbon fiber + foam layup. Most electric cruisers are already stiff 7-9ply maple that hardly flexes, so the decision to use a CF chassis was a bit easier, since both wood and CF cruisers have a similar harsh ride quality.

I'm in San Diego, so I unfortunately won't be able to get one out there in the wild just yet. There's an upcoming ridegroup in San Diego, so I'm hoping to get a comparison between the Banshee and Riptide's R1

Honestly, I'm unsure if the Chinese are using Sinsoudal, FOC, or BLDC. I can't control it, but all I can say is that the board gives a nice low-key purr that's still within my personal threshold of 'quiet'

@evoheyax Hah! I wished... So the board is indeed 'my design'. The deck is developed in tandem with one of Winboard's suppliers(which followed my exact requirements), 10S2P 30Q battery pack is custom and sourced elsewhere, motors and ESC are Winboard(I selected the drivetrain configuration). Hardware and griptape is sourced elsewhere. Winboard does the assembly. I guess in some twisted way you can call this board a 'rebrand', however that's like calling Kieran's Meepo a rebrand. I paid my dues and dictated the exact design and hardware of this board, so I'm proud to call it my own unique offering. I hope this answers your questions concerning the origins of this board.

There's work you had to do I'm sure. At the end of the day, almost no one actually machines and assembles micro controllers themselves (besides chaka and direct from china factories). It's not a bad looking board. But the 10s2p is very small for my tastes.

Heh. Oh I'm sure it's far underpowered versus your monster for a board. However I do hold the belief we have more power than most consumer boards in this price range. The ones that claim higher than us turn out to be going off of burst ratings or even worse the rating of their MOTORS and NOT their actual battery/ESC rating. I prefer to cut the bullshit.

How much for the deck?? I can put more oomph in the electronics. 

BTW, you cannot do 20A continuously without overheating your battery. Specially sealed. Moogs test is done on a bench with a single cell that can dissipate heat to its surroundings, not 20 cells in a sealed carbon fiber enclosure with zero airflow and only dissipating heat to themselves and the electronics. At best you'll get 10A without damaging the cells or electronics from heat over time.

The batteries won't be constantly pinned to 20a per cell. The only time we approach that level of current is during extended hill climbs and hard accelerations. Having a used my prototype since it has arrived, I haven't had an issue with the batteries overheating the entire enclosure.

I honestly don't see an issue here. For car manufacturers, they advertise the peak HP of a car because that shows the CAPABILITY of the product. The power rating exists as a catch all because manufacturers can't predict how much power a customer will require on a daily basis, however that rating still has a lot of useful meaning. Same logic applies to our board. Is Boosted Board using its 2000W continuously? Probs not, but then what's the 'average' power rating? Again, that power figure exists as a catch-all. If I went around advertising my board As having a power rating of 700W, the only good that will do is kneecapping my own company. We all KNOW our board can EASILY do over 700W. So advertising the 'theoretical average power' is useless and self-harming. Meanwhile, there are plenty of brands that advertise power ratings their fuses can't even allow üò§. If you want to sick somebody, go after them.

Hey man, you came here for critics right? You don't see boosted on these forums cause they would get chewed, spat and chewed on again for their shit advertising. Heck even onloop gets crap for his poop advertising and fake specs. 

If you want honest criticism, then I'm giving you some. Your board cannot do 1400W continuous. If you want to be just another e-board brand with exaggerated specs then by all means, say your board can do 1400W continuously, but dont ask for honest critics if you want it sugarcoated. 

E- I will be adding a few edits to respond to specific parts of your post. 

[quote="TheCheat, post:46, topic:37829"]

[/quote]

Yes, key word being peak. They don't advertise the car being able to sustain that horsepower for the whole ride, which is what you are suggesting.

[quote="TheCheat, post:46, topic:37829"]

[/quote]
Agreed. 

Here is the main difference:
Can your board do 1600W? Definitely no doubt. 
Can your board do 3200W? If the ESC and hubs can handle it, then absolutely. 
Can your board do 4500W? Again, if the ESC and hubs can handle it....

Can your board do any of that **continuously**?
**That would be a big fat negative ghost rider**

30Qs are rated for 15A continuous in free air. After that they are rated up to 80A as long as you keep them under 80 degrees celcius. Yes, you can drain these bad boys at 80A each as long as you keep them cool. Does that mean your board can do that? Maybe for 2 seconds... but definitely not continuous. 

If you want to advertise peak power, that's fine! But that is **VERY** different to continuous power.

[quote="TheCheat, post:46, topic:37829"]

[/quote]

Yes! Definitely! But not for 45 minutes! That is the whole point of the word continuous.

[quote="TheCheat, post:46, topic:37829"]
So advertising the 'theoretical average power' is useless and self-harming.
[/quote]

It's not theoretical, its a real limit. If you advertise it as 1400W continuous and I test it to 1400W continuous until the battery is flat and it catches fire, who's fault is it? 

It's also not average power. It's continuous power. Again, peak and continuous are very very very different, which is my point...

Is it useless and self-harming? 
If you tell me this board can do 700W continuous and up to 1500W continuous for 5 minutes. I would be impressed. 
If you tell me this board can do 1400W continuous then I will call you out and move on.

**BUT** and this is a big but, **I AM NOT THE TARGET AUDIENCE**. You are targeting people without any engineering background. In which case you kinda have to lie about specs, otherwise you do not stand a chance against others that do

```
I'm open for criticism, don't doubt that. However what I'm trying to explain is that our board can in fact do 1400W continuous. Ambiguity is a double edged sword, however I think my reasoning for our power rating is fair. If my boy @Jinra built a 30Q 12S3P in a sealed enclosure, does that instantly cut his power in half? Now I think about it, he will likely continuously leverage all that power in San Francisco... point being, it's still accepted he has a 2600W board. Exactly how much of that heat is passively radiated? How much power is Jinra really pulling up and down those hills? How do you average that out? Nobody is going to say "oh, your batteries will reach X temperature at X time, it's really only 1300W". Those power ratings are listed to the capabilities of the batteries because it eliminates a lot of assumptions that are entirely open to interpretation.

No it cannot! Here is proof:
REAL WORLD PROOF:

The temperature is delta over ambient temperature. Henrik tests the batteries at 25C. So at 2Ah depleted, the cells were at 75C

That is a single cell sitting on a desk. If you insulate that little guy, it would have reached that temperature much sooner. Put 20 of those buggers in a sealed enclosure and you would be lucky to get 1Ah before they hit 80C

This is not my data by the way, this is from a third party that has nothing to do with either one of us.

Well I appreciate your reconization that we are targeting consumers with a slightly more simplistic technical mindset. Firstly I'm not in the business to deceive, that is the antithesis for why I started this business in the first place. However i want to add that car manufacturers don't advertize of spec their car as doing a peak of X-HP and an average of Y-HP. It's just simply convoluted for most consumers. Let's do this, I'll gladly list 1400W-1600W as 'max power' in those words. I think your main gripe is with the word 'continuous'.

Already tried, we can't fit a 10S3P into the deck. Unless you are referring to an 8S3P setup, which would fit. However we would be trading Voltage for more amperage.

So I've been looking on how to grow the Dutch market and Winboard definitely caught my eye. Problem is, they're just another Chinese manufacturer who's aiming to get rich asap. I wouldn't trust they're motors or ESC to last as long as the ''high-end''. Which will only cause you stress in the long term. Why not go for a single belt driven motor?

A quick solution to you're battery problem, Winboard produces 10S3P packs with Samsung 30q cells also, why not take advantage of that? 

Still, I like the design and appreciate the work you're putting into this!

A big cost point is the CF deck, but if you compare it to prices of the raptor 2 for example i think it¬¥s too much for that board.

It's tough because a year or so ago, this kind of board would sell like cake. Today, theres so many boards that you need to do something different to stand out.

At the end of the day, if you market well, you can sell anything. But 1k does seem like a lot for unknown hub motors, unknown esc, and a small battery, hence the reason people want the deck solo.

What many do is they simply say it can do 2000 watts. They don't use the word "continuous" if it can't do it continuous, but they also don't use the word "max" or anything to make you believe its a burst. To the untrained customer, it looks amazing. To the trained customer, they will know it's peak and not continuous, because it didn't have the word continuous. It's really that simple!

I know you already worked this out, but just wanted to give me 2 cents :)

is the "continuous" rating even a standardized test for a certain period?  seems anyone could say anything if it's  not.  I imagine with car power ratings they can't just throw numbers out there on a whim.   Maybe you could say 2000 watts continuous and advertise it in the winter time or way up north.

Considering the circumstances, you know the answer to this.

I'm not trying to be critical, and didn't even mention anything until the conversation steered in that direction. It's really not that big of a deal.

Since you know what the real specs for the focbox are, mind clarifying for the world? I'm going off the best information I have available.

Test them yourself using the foc-openloop command in the vesc tool. Be sure to put your motor in a cup of water just like vedder did since you will cook your motor without air flow. Also I am pretty sure the software will not allow you to run high than 130 amps unless you run unlocked firmware. Be ready to fry a piece of hardware if you do run the unlocked firmware. The 130 amp limit is there for a reason ;)

In the vesc-tool you can test using the foc-openloop command but the vesc-tool has 130 amp limit built into it. If you want to test at a higher current you need to run it unlocked but you will fry your hardware if you run foc-openloop that high. 

300 amps :joy:

At that price point, I would probably pick a Carvon EXO. This mostly because I want a cruiser and not a commuter. The EXO "should" provide a better ride on full urethane and larger deck. 

Have you done a formal survey on the demand for commuter boards? I just have a feeling that most people buy esk8s for recreation and not really for commuting.

Just woke up. A lot of answers to pass around here... there is no doubt going to be a better board out there for similar amounts of money. However I think it's abundantly clear you are buying into both the product and the company behind it. Every Beta board will ship with a no-questions 1 year transferable warranty. I want early adopters to feel comfortable with their purchase. On top of that, since my partner and I have been importing goods for a combined total of 8 years, I am certain we can have these boards arrive before Christmas.

They tried pushing that garbage on us when we first contacted them. The deck makes you want to naturally spread out your feet to utilize the real estate, however that will put your feet outside the wheelbase and cause you to wheelie. That GT-M8 is the definition of Chinese design... Our board solves that issue by having the longest possible wheelbase on a 28" deck. You place you feet anywhere on our deck without any repercussions.

So here's the layup on the kind of market we are targeting. I'm not concerning myself with Enertion's R2 or Jed's AWD. The niche we are competing in is the high speed electric cruiser market. We are targeting customers looking for a lightweight, low profile commuter board that has the power to cut the distance as fast as possible. Versus say the Acton Blink S2, we have (what I believe to be) a bigger battery for more range, a light weight sealed unibody construction that is weather resistant, and a much higher top end speed. Oh and we have customer service.

Yeah i think the actual peak-continuous (not absolute microsecond peak) is somewhere closer to 30amps in my experience. Maintain anything higher than that for a period of time and its likely going to pop a fet or burn a trace or smoke a resistor or start calling you names or something. That's why i list them as "manufacturer stated" specs. 

Is that what you're seeing too? 

They're basically bullet proof though when used in pairs under a 60amp BMS, and even without that protection as long as the settings are reasonable and they aren't allowed to draw such insane currents. Sometimes i don't think people realise what you can do with 60 amps on two motors. I feel like i keep showing people that, but they keep yapping about 100s of amps the way they do about bigger wheels. yap yap yap. moar amps they say. The only place i really need more amps is in my toaster when i need a frozen waffle  right fucking now.

The first time I tried it all I did was clamp a cpu heatsink and fan to the case on an Ollin Direct VESC otherwise known as the Ollin v1.1 ESC. Similarly the VESC's in our FreeRide are mated to the aluminum hatch. This gives them a bit more headroom.

All the main power traces are tinned so they can handle the current fine with the extra solder to carry the current. Something you have probably seen on a bms.

The bigger issue is that it's hard to cut sizable treads into the hub motor PU while maintaining the structural integrity we desire.

This is the biggest problem. However, it's hard to know the quality of any of these boards until they are well tested. We know the quality of most of these direct from china boards, and they generally haven't been good. I personally have heard more bad than good things about winboard. So what makes you think your board will be any different? (ps: not trying to attack you, just want to get your point of view). The VESC is a must, but even most VESC's are garbage right now. Chaka vesc's from my experience are the only really bullet proof vesc I've ever owned. And I've tried most of the market.

People want originality. What makes your board different from what's out their already? People either want cheap, or super reliable. So the way I see it, there's a smaller market for mid priced, mid quality boards. Either people want cheap, or reliable.

If you wana score brownie points in this community too, we'd love to see stuff you've built with your hands also! :stuck_out_tongue:

BTW, you are in a good position distribution wise. But you should work on sourcing parts yourself instead of having winboard source everything for you. You'll be able to manage quality better and have more options in the parts you can put into your board. For example, with hummies motors, we have a guy that supplies us the stators, a guy whole casts our custom trucks, a guy who mills out out mechanical parts for the hub motor, and another source for the other odd end pieces we need. It would be nice some day to find a factory to assemble them instead of doing them ourselves forever, and then we would be in the same boat as the first motors, where we had fully assembled motors arriving at our door, and then being reboxed up and pushed out the door. But the beauty here is that if we want to change something, we have the full flexibility to do so. If one guy says they can't machine the hub motors can this way, we find another and the rest of the supply chain isn't messed up also.

Just my 2 cents, no offense meant and best of luck!

Sent you a PM concerning my thoughts on sourcing parts.

As of now the Banshee is basically my take on how an ideal portable electric skateboard should be like. Most cruisers for example are incredibly heavy or bulky. Carrying them is a pain in the ass, especially since pretty much all of them use an external battery enclosure that is crushed against your arm. Even worse is when the thin wood deck cuts into your fingers while you carry the board. The Banshee is 12.5 lbs and has thick bevel edges that your fingers can wrap around. Transport and ease of use is a breeze. We beat most cruisers in speed and power delivery, whilst simultaneously having arguably the longest achievable range with a 10S2P 18650 battery pack. Those are what I can think of off the top of my head...

Onto what I've built... I actually posted here before on my personal account. I'd repost them, but the 4g here is crap.

So what makes you think your board will be any different? Your website just was built last month and I do not think FOC box is a new product, not mention originality. Any brand on the market has its own bad news or good news, no perfect products, complaints always comes.

haha, good stuff.

What makes my board different?

First off, I test all of my electronics thoroughly. The focbox may be a great speed controller, it might not be. I haven't tested it long enough to say that it will be the best. But what I can say is its way better than your esc's. They are not in the same league. Yours likely contain fake components, and are not going to last.

From my standpoint, your firmware is closed source, which means I can not write iphone apps and andriod apps that work with them. They are meant for lower power systems also. The focbox off the bat can do far higher amps. I run 6000 watts continuous now with 4x the 4.12 chaka vescs. Good luck putting 1500 watts continuous through one of your speed controllers.

On top of that, your hub motors will fall apart quickly under stress. It's really bad engineering. Only 2 people have figured out how to make good hub motors, and that is Jason at enertion and hummie / me. I have already explained why, so you could fix all of your problems. But at the end of the day, you won't adopt the methods we use because the cost will be too high for you. We have contacted 100's of motor manufacturers, and none will wind our motors the way we want them, because it requires more labor. You don't know what goes in a really good hub motor.

I am about working with and building high quality products. The FOCBOX may or may not be the best ESC. But it's far better than what you are using. And if it fails to be bullet proof, I will move back to chaka vescs. I have ran 8 of these guys for over 2 years now, over 2000 miles and not a single issue with the pcb assemble (only when I short things with 50.4v being an idiot while building). Why? Because this guy assembles them under tight controls, using authentic parts from mouser, not fake parts from the factory down the street from you.

Really, you and everyone else selling straight from china don't understand that these are not toys that it's ok for them to break. They need to be super reliable. No, nothing is perfect, no matter what, issues will arise on everyones products. But they should be far less than 1%. This is why I have not sold completes yet. I am working on mixing my own designs with other proven, high quality designs.

You don't know what goes into a board to make it good quality. 18650's are a joke, they are used in toys, not serious electric skateboards.

The reason my board will be different is because the quality of electronics will far exceed yours. You can sell what you want, but I am in a different league then you when it comes to e-skate technology. You will cut corners, while I over engineer everything. I don't think, how can I make a cheap product that everyone will want. I think of how to make a quality product that will last, while running very high watts.

[quote="winboard-sally, post:113, topic:37829"]

[/quote]

And that means I can't be any decent? I have been researching and developing e-boards for over 2.5 years, which is longer than most in the market today. Instead of cutting corners, I over engineer everything. I run my boards very hard. You need 5+ years of skateboarding to be able to ride the way I ride. I have 13 years of experience. No one has been able to beat me in a straight race. I am twice as fast as the raptor 2, and that is by far the most powerful complete board sold today.

I mea you got my vote, saving haaard for the hummies for a 4wd.

But lets not forget that you same as me, want somethig different out of an e-board. I f we go freeriding having a balst a 50/60+ is usual. Taking sweepers, doing stanndies, drifting around corrners annd blasting trough the country side is what we are about. I love it, I am obsessed with it. Everyday I wasn't riding I get weird and unnneasy.

But for others going 20 straight is already a challenge, the they see at turn comig up and their heart starts pumping. So I guess to eatch their own. You are in the process of building a high performance vehicle. They are producing a mass product for enntry level customers. Your focus is performace annd reliability, theirs ist sale numbers and margains.


And the argument never gets old apparently that all board are more or less the same. Had that connversation more than I would ever wannt to. Pepple telling me that I am stupid spennding so much on a 12s4p DIY, because their bechwheel is just as good..... Well, mayby they are equal for THEM sice they ride both the same way, no where ear their potential.

PS: Rocketboard as a name allways felt positively to me sice: [these guys](http://rocketlongboards.ch/) make sick ass boards and are swiss and really close to me :)

double the specs, halve the throughput, gain reliability.

focboxes are dead reliable in hybrid bldc mode in a dual config under moderately conservative settings. I run both of mine under 60 amps total and they don't do me wrong.

Firstly I totally agree with you what you said, I just do not like the way you speak. You blablabla too much, but I still can not see any difference for your board, we had FOC box, Enertion had FOC box, many people had diy FOC box, now you sell FOC box again, as you said, can you come up with something originality? Like FOD basket, GOC container, POD locker or just change a name, or some new technology, which would be of much more originality and eye catching. 
Cheap product ‚â† bad quality, you can buy a T-shirt at price 5 dollars, 50 dollars, 500 dollars or 5000 dollars, different price comes with different target audience, 5000 dollars T-shirt much better than 50 dollars? I do not think so. 2.5 years experience is a long time? We even need to take 3 years to finish kindergarten, 5 years to finish primary school. 2.5 years even not enough to finish kindergarten. If 18650 is a joke, i want to learn something ORIGINALITY and recreation from you, such as use polar energy, water energy, or any other fuel energy people never used to power electric skateboard. We expect this. 
No matter what you boast for your product, you can say it will last 20 years with high quality ad never break down, it would not come with battery, it will be pushed by wind, it can fly in the sky, it can dive in ocean, it can dance, sing and call Dad and Mom, I do not care, none of my business. You just do not know what respect is.

In a 10s2p or 10s3p config, yes.

We can't fit 13s6p into pretty much any board. The problem is you need large configs to get the power I need from them.

Also, your talking about a bike, where you can get a huge motor on that thing. Larger motor means you need less amps to get the same torque to some degree.

Look, @winboard-sally I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings, I don't like to bash anyone. I try not to do that, but your attitude was rude from the beginning with me.

I don't just resell other peoples products. Everyone has to start from somewheres, and in this case, I need to make a buck to invest into my own products. How long have you been manufacturing boards anyways?

@PXSS Again, I don't want to talk shit, just people don't know the power you could get by having motors that can run at high amps, and batteries that can keep up too. 18650's can't do this in the configs that can fit on most electric skateboards (besides offroad boards). If you think they can, you haven't felt the power of my board, sorry.

Where is the telemetry data of said board?

You guys barely seem to grasp the basics from an engineering standpoint. Hummie doesn't even understand why when he goes to 100% throttle the ESC doesn't pump 80A to his motor. I'm not sure either of you understands how and why a bms works the way it does. 

I'm not a vendor. I'm not here to mislead anyone into buying anything from me. I'm an engineer that works with similar scale uavs for government entities for a living and love to tinker with this stuff for fun. I can admit when I'm out of my depth with things and learn from more educated people.

Gotta say I have seen @evoheyax e-skate equipment in competition and it's impressive.  SPD2 it qualified over 2 seconds quicker than any other board on thane.  A degree in engineering doesn't make an engineer. It's a piece of paper. These guys up in NorCal are doing their thing, it's working, I'm sure it is not a full time job for them but they are well respected by the community in what they do and have a decent handle on what works. Unfortunately it's tough for upstart companies to get a foothold here on account there has been so much maypop junk coming from all directions.

We still have a lot to learn. Neither of us have degrees in engineering and neither us are claiming to. I am 2 classes away from finishing my Bachelors Degree in Computer Science, so software is more my specialty. I do have to learn hardware to some degree, I'm even building my own single cycle cpu right now from the ground up (logical gate level) for one of my classes, and programming it from there.

John has told me he's read physics books and thats where he learned a lot (though I don't speak for him).

When it comes down to it, we have professional engineers double and triple check everything we do.

We constantly ask experts questions to understand systems better. I understand general physics (I did have to study this) along with digital electronics. I have many of the electronic foundations, and a general understand of how the VESC works (duty cycle, FOC). BMS, maybe slightly less with the BMS.

A lot of vesc settings are learned through trial and error. Eventually, you figure out what settings give the best results. Even other things. I understand why I get jolt

Motors are our specialty, and were not trying to reinvent the VESC or BMS at this time. The thing is, there's many working on these components that we can work with to utilize their technology. We understand motors very well. The other pieces, we continue to understand better. It's not we don't understand a lot about the VESC, but who selling it actually understands everything? I bet you very few if any.

It's just coming from a different angle.   Hummie and evo build stuff as experiments, then make conclusions based on the results.  Like scientists in the 1800s discovering magnetism or whatever invisible shit.   

Engineers go to school to learn the basic fundamentals of what is really happening, but, if they don't actually build the shit then they still think the real world looks like the simplified textbook versions, which is also kinda wrong.

There are a lot of interesting mechanical innovations happening in esk8 but electrically most devices are still mysterious boxes that amps go in and out of lol

I think it's fantastic you have a specialized field that gives you the mindset, in your opinion, that people other than yourself don't have the mindset to understand how a thing works. It's also fantastic you use your title as a pulpit to stand to berate others who can't possibly, in your mind, meet your standards of excellence. So here is an idea. With this specialized education and title you throw around in peoples faces that gives you supreme power to dictate to others here, what they are and how they stack up in the eyes of the elite educated an enriched supreme specialized engineers, as yourself, give me ONE thing you have engineered, that has been a major benefit or contribution you can claim or call your own to this community.  Name it and I will concede. If ya can't then stop thumping people's chests with your title.   Being an engineer can't be taught, it's a gift only a few have.  The paper and all the education is great if you have the gift. This builders forum is full of people with the gift who Don't have the paper.

Nobody even knew about ru.nkon a year ago. I've been getting cheap batteries through them for the past 3 years. A year ago I bought cells at $3.00 for 100 icluding shipping. Then I bought 70 for $3.30 shipped when I built a second battery and one for @mmaner. Then I spread the word to some and when the ball started rolling @thisguyhere did a groupbuy for $3.50 shipped. If anything the price has been going up at Nkon. Other places are still charging $5+ a cell. 

Go into my activity log and scroll through posts in the January-March time frame. There is a lot of me convicing people to use 30Qs before Enertion announced they were moving over to 30Q.   The Raptor 1 used 25Rs and the Raptor 2 more than likely would have also used 25Rs had it not been for the word spreading by @Okami and others. 

You can see that people back then were saying I didnt know what I was talking about and that 25Rs were rated higher and all that jizz. It's there in the logs. Show me where Enertion, pre-November 2016 showed any interest in 30Qs, that's when I built my first e-skate with that battery.

I originally got @PXSS to build me the 30Q pack to test against lipo performance. I honestly didn't Bruce you could get sufficient amps out of any li-ion cell.  I was happily surprised.  40Q's is what I run in 3 of my 5 boards now. I might get another 30Q pack from @oriol360 in a couple of weeks.  

I can also say with certainty that @PXSS was evangelizing 30Q's  before anyone, even @onloop on the R2.

i mean they look kinda thin.  everyone is trying to make them small.  they're the most thermally conductive pathway to the hotest part of the motor.   if they were a wire mesh..that might rock at dissipating the heat in the passing wind actually.  or glue the mesh to the aluminum hanger

That's an old Tronik sled with the original removable 13S6P battery pack. Its designed for use on offroad boards with 8" wheels, like the giant brushed DC boards.  Jake put it on a generic ebay deck and we're running focboxes and 190kv totally bitchins on there to test how the focboxes can handle 13S voltages on my motors. Testing has been wildly successful. He's seeing speeds of around 41-42mph on a regular basis and so far we've only melted a couple of eswitches. 

Which means we're finally seeing the limits of my eswitches! FINALLY. But clearly not the limits of the FocBox. I've been told by several people who know wtf they're talking about, including @blasto that shit shouldn't be possible, or at least shouldn't last very long. I think settings have everything to do with it. We don't typically crank shit all the way up and then complain about blowing shit later. We use conservative settings and then press them more and more. This will tell us what we can get away with in production boards. 

Where to put 78 cells is always a good question. @chaka says but them in the deck, and he has done so. I say put them in the box, and i have done so. Perhaps the answer lies somewhere in between. Pehaps we should do so. Thick deck, machined inset, heavy box designed for structural support, paired with large bolts and you get something  like the evos i'm building for carvon... evolution indeed! The Evo's enclosure will be able to hold a 12S6P and twin focboxes or a 12S4P with 4 focboxes,  OR .. you know.. a 13S4P with twin focboxes.  

I would never take something that clunky to production but we are constantly testing the limits of things, and we need these kinds of boards to see what's possible. 

on another note... just about my shop in general.. 
I don't sell shit i don't use. If you buy it from my shop you're getting it the way it goes into my boards, which is why i'm selling the FocBoxes with a $10 bullet mod now. I don't use shitty phase leads all the way to the motor (thank you @hummie ). For 2 or 3 inches that's fine but the leads on my boards are long and this 16awg shit is lame. I run 12 all the way to my totally bitchin stators.

Here's another healthy slice of Mind Blown:

I do custom completes, instagram is full of them, but not all of them. Probably get an order for and ship one to two every month on average. 

I do bamboo mods, the volume is constantly increasing, i have 5 orders in the queue right now and the boards haven't even arrived yet. They all came in within a week of somebody posting terrible things about doing battery mods to your evolve and how it goes against the warranty and isn't safe. Thanks evolve puppets! They're like fucking angel investors i swear. Oh fuck there's another one, my phone lit up. 

I'm developing now and will be producing the Carvon Evos and Exos, things are looking really good on that. I think the boxes will be finalized just as the motors start arriving which means assembly testing is happening very very soon. 

I have a full time day job too. And a 3 year old toddler, a 16year old son who's amazing, and a wife i love to spend time with. 

I simply don't sleep regularly. I catch it when i can and work when i have the least distractions. My schedule is similar to that of a vampire's. Ask Sololongboards sometime, Russ is in the UK and he's producing some of the most amazing decks for Slick Revolution I've ever seen. But i'm up talking to him at 2am because he's got some crazy secret sauce i need to know about regarding his machines and i need to be getting ready for work at 5:30am.

Chickens and eggs my freinds. Can't do this full time till i make enough money to do it full time. Need to do it full time in order to make the money to do it full time. 

Shredded chicken omelletes are awesome. So that's what i'm making bitches. You just have to fucking do it. You can't talk about it, then go to bed. YOu have to stay up and fucking do it. 

That's what i'm doing.

@longhairedboy  That's thick................. Did you measure the size of the pack (height x width x thickness in mm) ? how is this thing wired ? Is there air-room between cells?

You got my blood burning :japanese_ogre: Ha I'd bet one of your board you can **at least** halve down the thickness of this 13S6P with my modules but I can only bet back a pack of beers right now (November has been a bitch double sideways _2girls1youknowtherest_ version). I dare you! haha

Edit : I mean... that's _only_ 78 cells !

@evoheyax Joining the fray late ! If your 18650 cells in 12S4P can't feed the power you want then you're using the wrong cells.  12s4p LG HB2, assuming **worst** voltage sag when almost depleted : 12x3x35a x4 = 5040W. A 12s5p in same worst voltage sag, almost depleted, hits 6120W. I see no toy-like battery here, sure the range is shit compared to 30Q but it will run hard above VESC continuous abilities. 

Just saying that it more than capable to run hard your motors (and thanks again for making the topic on hubs motors, I'll post what I'm modding later on it once them micro oven are alive).

Edit ¬≤ : Not hijacking the thread, I look forward to see the boards running :wink:

Your correct in the sense that there are better cells to get the power i need. But the range will take way too much of a hit. At least with looks, I can get pretty the same range out of the same sized battery pack as a 30Q pack.

The 30Q in my case is not good enough. For dual drive it is ok (still not ideal), but defiantly not enough for quad, unless I do a 12s8p, which won‚Äôt ever fit inside a deck like I want it to.

Don't want to be rude or anything. But this inherently the issue when you source all of your parts from one company, that also does the final assembly.

Hummie had the same issue when he used one company to machine and assemble hub motors. So now, everything is spread out between 4 companies, and we do the final assembly. That and you make some proprietary pieces (in our case, the truck and wheel design) so that theres more work to get ripped off than them doing what they already doing.

BTW, did you design the deck from the ground up?
```

## \#190 Posted by: PredatorBoards Posted at: 2018-01-22T02:33:52.165Z Reads: 243

The deck is a collaboration between me and Winboard. That means the design was worked on by both parties. Admittedly i did most of the material selection and design analysis while Winboard took the guess work out of the actual production aspects.

Don't worry about being rude. I knew sooner or later the Banshee would be hijacked by other companies. However you pay to play, and the only way I was ever going to get a CF board built (without wasting a ludicrous amount of money in initial assembly startup costs) was through Winboard. 

I'm making steps to diversify the manufacturing to make it harder to copy the Banshee.

First thing's first is this new ESC + Firmware config:
https://youtu.be/6hI7AlIBbHw


'twas developed by some friends from an up and coming esk8 company. We'll be using an updated version of this ESC in the Banshee. I'm pretty sure nobody else is using this :wink:

Here's a video of the old Banshee ESC ramping up. You can clearly hear the abrupt 'steps' in the throttle.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjUjqc---nY


For the old ESC, I counted 5 'steps' in the throttle. Can you count how many there were for the new ESC?

Since we will be supplying Wnboard with this ESC, Huboards won't be able replicate this configuration for at least a while.

@PredatorBoards I received my board a couple of days ago and have been riding it as much as possible since. The board feels nice and solid. No rattling and the long wheelbase on the board make the board feel very controllable at high speeds. The torque up hills has been rather surprising. I have hit it with all the steepest hills in my area and it has made it up all of them. The ride is of course stiff, being a carbon fibre board but having owned and ridden two other carbon fibre decks (Raptor 1 & Torqueboard Rocket) it feels more forgiving. 

The remote is nice in the hand. As others have said, it is twitchy but that's just a learning curve knowing how to control the throttle. The brakes are strong, I'm about 170 pounds and it slows me to a stop on steep down hills. 

This board is my inner city commuter board so I needed a lighter weight and portable setup. The predator is perfect for this. The only thing I have changed is the front truck. I swapped out the paris clone (which was a little wide for my backpack) for a narrower Paris front truck. Even after swapping for the narrower truck the board still feels stable and even feels good carving.

I also added a carbon fibre bashguard to the rear so I wouldn't ruin the carbon fibre board. 
![IMG_0692|374x499](upload://jdUN1gucQv0cDWx64plBplTBWZ4.png)![IMG_0694|500x375](upload://fTiZzQqGsv8DiI9Scw8ezSM9ugX.png)

The only issue I have is with the cables. It appears that the cable sheething has been cut too short or has moved down the cables. Not a big issue. Eventually, I will take the board apart and heat-shrink the cables. But I assume with the cables the way they are, the waterproof qualities of the board would be effected.

The new ESC is not characterized to the Banshee's hub motors, but it works beautifully with the Meepo/wowgo hubs. It's incredibly smooth to the point it feels like it's lagging IMO.

Corrections to all the miss understanding.
1. Design of the main board: Winboard.
2. Carbon fiber mould investment: Winboard.
3. Motor selection: Winboard.
4. TTL manufacture: Winboard.
5. Esc development: Winboard.
6. Battery selection: predator.(sourcing winboard)
7. Wheel base enlargement idea: predator team.

Correction to the contract violation.
1. Indeed winboard gave the product to huboards.
2. But the important part is why.
    (here's my guess, but almost 95% will be correct)
     1) Predator team gave an offer to winboard on
          a huge amt of sales and asked exclusiveness.
     2) Winboard invested a lot of money on the board
         and believed if they gave exclusive to predator
         than the predator will achieve.
     3) But like always, business does not grow that
          fast nomatter what.
     4) And by the fact that almost all the investment
         has been made from winboard, the desperate 
         side would probably be winboard.
     5) So winboard probably went to another seller.
          Because with only predator they could not 
          retrieve the investment.
3. Now what would a company do if one seller asked
    the supplier exclusiveness but not achieving sales
    as promised....
    I would definitely go back to the contract and
    renegotiate.....

Defintitely predator team did a lot of activities in the esk8 and reddit forum.(i can see that)
And this is highly credited to be one of the most important part in electric skateboard business.
(Probably all the business)

But what they did rong is revealing there business partner and the original maker to look like a company that does not even have there ethics.
(This winboard company not only makes predator banshee but also a lot of other famous boards and the only trouble they have is with predator...strange)

I've never owned a banshee, hell I don't even want one...just not my thing.  But the above post, I'm just gonna call BS on that.  This cat has been here for about 2.5 minutes, never posted a topic or replied on another thread, much less a build.  Also, it barely skims the rules about vendor bashing.  I hate to see a vendors reputation get sullied by someone who hasn't proved he's legit.  We have too few companies to supply as it is.

@moderators, maybe wanna take a look at this?

I can't speak for the second part of his post but the first part is true... Winboard took the majority of the risk in developing this board and a lot of the responsibility. Essentially, it was business anyone could have done. It's not hard to get china to make you a complete board using parts borrowed from a dozen other complete boards. All you do is go to alibaba, find someone making these boards, and pay a little extra to customize it so you can put your name on the griptape. The problem and reason most don't take this route is because your not going to produce a high quality board this way. You need to develop your own parts or work with people who have developed these parts if you want quality. But quality doesn't come cheap. And banshee is all about price. I know he'd love to use our hub motors, but they cost more for us to make than these hub motors do to him. That is inherently the issue in eskate. Many do not want to pay 2k for eskate. So they compromise to something a bit more economical, like the banshee.

If he advertised his partner winboard, it would just look like another cheap china board (and theres a lot of them these days). Maybe it is, maybe it is't, I can't judge cause I never ridden one. But we all start from somewheres. I know he'll one day build more from the ground up because it's necessary if you want to control quality and create a truly unique experience. But for the time being, it is what it is, which is a board manufactured and assembled by winboard. You can try to hide that part, create an image away from that, but you can't escape the roots. It might help in the long run to be open about winboard being a partner. Since they have taken so much responsibility, it's not @PredatorBoards  thats responsible when an esc fails or a motor stops working, it's winboard. What ever their quality level is, is the quality level of the banshee. It would be nice if consumers knew this, but it is what it is, a business. And no business operates against it's best interests. And consumers should know this so they can make an informed decision.

In the long run, it won't matter, as I see @PredatorBoards looking to get parts from other places.

Right. But one thing is for sure that just because its made from china does not mean its equal to less quality. As far as I know, only metroboard is made in the united sates. And i am not sure if most the poeple here are aware that the rest is all from china manufacture.(boosted, evolve, raptor)

The point is not from where but how.
Still these boards all have great quality from the ownership of the company policy and i figure they only chosen the location of manufacture from where they can get infrastructure close and echonomically.

[/quote]

The difference though is all of the boards you mention were not designed in china, by Chinese manufacturers.

For example, we have some parts machined in china. The thing is these parts need to be design by people who know electric skateboards. Every "test" I've seen from any of these manufacturers is deeply flawed and doesn't really test anything. They don't know any better because they don't actually use it themselves. As to quality, I can't say. But I can promise they make choices to sacrifice quality, whether they are visible or not. It's the only way to get the price low. Even if we we're to order 1000+ motor parts for example, our price only drops at best 30%. Still more expensive at cost for us without the labor of assembly then these motors are assembled. Bulk pricing only does so much. What save money? Use aluminum instead of steel, weaker magnets instead of strong ones, multi strand thin mostly insulation with little copper motor wire instead of high heat thick motor wire, hard to take apart and fix instead of designed to be easily serviceable. That's the difference that money pays for and not one company in china has done any of these things. It's only outsiders who turn to china for cheap labor.

Oh sorry if i said it like if i was against you. I totally agree on most of your words and have no doubt. Sacrificing quality to cost...yes this sometimes is cost, sometimes time, and sometimes just miss calculation. I am from korea and work in a pretty big electronics company though its not skateboard haha. But we also have this issue to bring up whenever we meet quality issues. And yet there is not a dominate answer to this. The only part i wanted to point out is that lets just not determine evrything which is made from china manufactures will go for there money and wont give a crap on there customers. Many people overthere might just think as the ones who think like you think.

I'd like to comment about our contract and go in depth about the whole situation, however the simple fact of the matter is that I'm not interested in making our relation with the manufacturer hostile by throwing fuel in the fire.

I will say @evoheyax, It's definitely true that all the tests that manufacturers tend to do are non-sensical and surmount to nothing a little more than a vain marketing attempt of their components. So who ends up testing these components and making the call on what gets scrapped? Me. If it was up to them to design a board for me to sell, they'd literally strap a music box to it and ask me to market it as a 'major feature'. See where I'm getting at? The buck stops at us to specify and design a purpose built product, and I like to think I carry a very specific vision for this company and where I want it to go.


As of now, a majority of the components used in the Banshee are compartmentalized. Only the deck and battery are sourced through our manufacturer. I can give less of a shit about the deck. You guys already know my other business dealings on this forum, that deck is definitely not my end game...

Dear predator. One thing I can say is that I still admire what you have accomplished out of such little asset in your possession. And also correcting things that come up on this forum and having salubrious arguments are what is to be done. But try approaching matters without giving negative opinions to what the others say. Same to @evoheyax i guess. Predator may not have done big investings at the first place but the fact is that it is more difficult to raise a company with only bare hands. Trying to make differences and improving things are also what is to be credited to predator team. Still scaching one another on just the differences does not make anything reach to a good point in my experience. Difference is not rong. Its just difference.

Oh I know this board in it's current configuration is not your end game at all. But like I said, it is what it is till then.

I guess we all find our way in some how. I personally like building from the ground up rather than choosing other peoples components, but again, we all start somewheres. Theres a million and one things that can wrong in an eskate. Heck I've built 8 boards in the past 3 years, and not one hasn't needed work after thinking your finished. Something, usually multiple things, go wrong. Heck, I blew out a vesc yesterday because of I guess an incomplete joint in he + wire from the cap board that lead to the vesc. It got free someone, sparked everywhere, somehow didn't start a fie, but killed the vesc. I found out the hard way when I replaced the cap board and wire it back up, sparks and flames shot out. This shit happens in builds, especially when you run bleeding edge. Put some boards together outside the banshee, and you'll see how many things can go wrong. 2 days ago, my receiver cable failed while going down a farly steep hill, scary as fuck. Shit just happens.

I don't argue/debate with people I don't care about or believe can't be successful, so take that as a good note. Just build some different things, try out different stuff, you'll learn so much by riding other peoples boards also ;P

I viewed the video. Did he submerge the board or simulate a splash spraying water underneath the boardI personally think weather proof and waterproof are different. I do see how the statement on the statement made on the site could be misleading. Ive gotten caught in the rain on my hub board that isnt a banshee. I still avoided puddles since the splash could potentially wet the esc or find some way to get in my electronics. I always air dried with a compressor afterwards as well.  Good luck tho

Just got my board and am very disappointed. It performs well other than I can only get 8.4kms out out of it on a well paved surface without braking on a full charge. I've brought this to the attention of the company through their web site over a month ago as I have received a faulty board or they are grossly exaggerating the specs of the product. Hopefully their warranty will cover this defect but I have yet to have herd back from them.
I will keep everyone posted of all developments
