not sure about more torque but the quiet operation is pretty awesome.

snuck on my girlfriend inside the apartment, she had no idea what hit her.

did it mainly because there's a long corridor leading to the elevators in my building, and i felt bad about the whining noise.

i see, vedder in his video said at 40khz mosfets and drv switching would require more current which means more heat so i though the opposite would be better.

i need to tune it some more tho because getting wheel lock at low speed braking.  would you still use the "Max ERPM at Full Brake" to tune this?
```

---
## \#18 Posted by: Deckoz Posted at: 2018-03-12T17:44:23.146Z Reads: 208

```
So that is accurate.  More current will be used but it's negilgible from what I have seen. I use the switching frequency to tune the smoothness of the torque.

Anyway FOC has a weird behavior that it likes to not hold position when fully braked and standing still and under 3mph it quickly ramps to full brake.

For FOC you've gotta use the current values to tune braking.
Motor min for high speed braking force, batt min for lowspeed braking force. But I've never been able to "fix it" completely. So I've just gotten used to progressively releasing brake around 3mph and putting my foot down.


Once you figure out where the full brake point is your thumb will get used to do a progressive release so you can stop without it wheel locking..

My board is on FOCBOX's and running 12S, 190kv sensored.  Observing the graphs in the VESC Tool, the erpms max out at around 54k.  So I feel plenty safe, especially considering that is like 34 mph which I will probably never hit.  

These are TB motors, so they probably are around 180 or 170kv in the end.

Yeah I second this, it has almost thrown me when I'm going 1 mph next to someone walking and then accidentally lock the wheels by braking.

It is quite annoying... but bearable.

I don't really have a choice either since for whatever reason the VESC tool refuses to do BLDC detection on my focboxes.

@Deckoz Thanks for the info! It's sweet to have these settings summarized. 

@thisguyhere I also run 12s foc sensored. Both FOCBOX's, one is new, and one is from when they werr still called Vesc-X. Probably put 200-300 miles on the old one, but that was mostly at 8s. All in all, each has around 70 or 80 miles on 12s foc

I run the Hobbyking cheapo VESC that everyone says is crap, and I run it on 12 cell in FOC mode, sensored, ON ALL MY SETUPS! and I have never blown a HK VESC...(except when shorting phase wires mechanically and disastrously..lol)

I plugged in my 1st FOCBOX this weekend to program it for a forum member here, it smoked on the 1st test...so I installed a Hobbyking cheapo crappy older version and I literally went through the wizard, enabled FOC, sensors, did the tests, saved and rode it..

I am beginning to think there's some silly marketing going on or things out of spec..and this cheap crap everyone hates from Hobbyking is the most robust stuff I have used yet, and I spent thousands acquiring examples of everything to test..so I'm not just saying this because it's what I use or bought 1st, but I'm speaking from experience..I have never used BDLC mode on any vesc, because I have never had too and nothing ever smoked, till I plugged in a FOCBOX...I thought the FOCBOX was suppose to handle more power and be more robust? I'm not trying to be negative or trash anything, but the people who all run around saying this or that, I find to be wrong, from experience earned with my own hands and thousands of miles of testing...take it or leave it..

i think 10s is the sweet spot, meaning it's been shown to be more unstable at higher voltages.

but considering the responses above, there doesn't seem to be any solid consensus on idea FOC setups.

I've also run FOC unsensored at 10S on a TB vesc and no problems, in fact the TB complete boards came 12S FOC stock and my brother's has been fine and is a rocket. 

I tried it 12S FOC with focboxes, but I missed the electric motor sound. Honestly I love that high pitched whine and it lets pedestrians know I'm coming (that is if they're paying attention at all). So i guess I prefer BLDC

FOC and BLDC both pull hard... Almost the same. But top speed of FOC is a few mph slower then BLDC.

FOC is significantly smoother transitions of throttle. And quieter.

IMHO that just sounds silly... maybe because i am not a poser and want to drive the board instead of Hearing it.
The drawback of loud Motors is that you overhear Problems with your board. You can easily overhear some rattling which indicates Trouble never the less..... 

Just to put it in a nutshell: I will not go back to BLDC anytime soon, because:
- you hear a lot more without loud Motors
- you have a much smoother startup

In the VESC TOOL there is a Switch to Change the mode. But you can barely Access the VESC TOOL on the fly... (attaching usb cable to a pc with the software installed)

For example I left my board outside in the garage plugged in walked up stairs to the computer changed settings  and walked back outside... Vs carrying 30lb board upstairs, unbolting enclosure to plug in USB etc

Well, many of us could alter the VESC MONITOR app to Change all values possible.
Why did not ackmania or someone else did this earlier?

Because you do not Need These Settings to Change daily. It will only lead to Problems...
How often does a user make a Motor calibration. Normally only the first time he sets the board up. After Setup he will leave it like that. But to Change if the board has more or less power is good Option!

You are absolutely right. I did not know the possibilities of metr.

I will count-down the days until you accidentally make a mistake and cook an ESC.

For doing something like swapping drives, you should probably be changing the user interface to support that as well, because it's too easy to make a critical mistake getting in the VESC settings that often.

After one detection it should be as simple as selecting a mode and loading it:

But carefulness should be taken agreed. 

I rather not swap out the VESC everyone since that kills part of the point. I think using Perimetr should be fine

I hate when people change the title and don't say that they did it So I'll say it I removed the "Heated" part,

This is a pretty good discussion @Deckoz made us aware of a good program and the power of Bluetooth module and @b264 said well you could ruin something. But if there would be an app where you can preset idiot proof modes I see something useful.  The risk factor is there but ill research this idea

You can do this.

Use VESC tool, program the vesc. Read the settings with perimeter and save it as a config profile. Change the vesc tool settings, read again from perimeter save as a different config profile.

Switch between profiles you setup with vesc tool via perimeter

Yeah, that sounds good, If I bought enertions warranty I would totally do that Near my neighbourhood be quiet not to disturb near roads get load and powerful in the city back to Foc,

For me its nothing about being practical Its just having cool features that makes my board different from others,
and that was just one of the Ideas I probably won't do that because I can't afford a blown vesc or any error.

Yeah i was on my normal work commute, it was a little wet on the ground but nothing unusual. just finished a big flat section, came up to the big hill. There are traffic lights at the bottom so i usually go past them them wait for the lights to go red, this way i can go up the hill without worrying about any cars being behind me cause they are all stuck at the lights.

So the lights go red and the last car goes past. I pull away as normal, get about 2m forward when everything cuts out. look down and red light is flashing on one of my vesc's. Seems like in fault condition it also stops sending throttle commands over CAN bus.

It was not under much load and nowhere neer erpm limit. maybe it happened at the point of switching from hall to sensorless??

Walk to work. at lunch open up and everything looks good, plug in usb and its showing drv error on my master, slave is fine. inside focbox everything looks ok, no obvious signs of electrical damage, no smell of magic smoke.

i built a new temporary enclosure ~2 weeks ago so i know everything was secure inside and nothing would be touching that shouldn't be. 

Only thing i can think is that maybe it got wet? maybe one of the caps died? 

it seems like the DRV error can be caused by a whole host of things. if anyone knows a good way to diagnose i would like to know :frowning:

it covers blitzâ€™s want to change on the fly. Use it how you see fit.

Do we need to do motor detection every time if we change between bldc and foc? Are the detection bonded to the mode or is it interchangeable?
