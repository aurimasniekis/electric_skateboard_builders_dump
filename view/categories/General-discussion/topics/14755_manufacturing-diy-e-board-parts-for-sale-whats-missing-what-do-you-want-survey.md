Hi Everyone! 

I'm a young electric skateboard builder looking at getting into the manufacturing and distribution of E-Board Parts. Having recently published some of my designs online I noticed that a lot of people were interested in what i had created, asking for CAD files, and in some cases asking if i sold the parts. This feedback gave me the idea of manufacturing a large quantity of parts to sell to people. 

_**Below I have made some polls in the hopes that I some of you will respond, thus giving me a better insight into what the E-boarders want!**_ All feedback is appreciated, constructive criticism only please :)

Caliber 2, enertion, and diy are all the same. 
I did a poll for this several months ago. Cronins are the winner, hands down!

@Saul - Can you fit 12mm on Cronins though :slight_smile:

People will always buy a loaded deck and not spend the same amount on trucks. I feel bad for the truck companies too.

anything is possible!

and i don't think thats really true. some people will get all high end components once they are hooked. I've never liked calibers, I only use one for the rear drive truck, Bear or buck trucks on front! 

but not too many are looking to speed $500 on a longboard ($200 on a deck, $100 on trucks, $100 on flywheels, $80 ceramic bearings). They usually want to spend $500 for a complete esk8! :joy:
