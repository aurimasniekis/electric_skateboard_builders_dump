Damn, I'm so sorry to read this man.

However, the fix seems to be pretty simple just needs a   charge port swap. 

I'd also suggest to check the balance of the packs and add fish paper between packs.

If you are willing to improve the battery yourself I offer we make a FaceTime call and we'll fix it together for good.

@Mikenopolis sorry to hear about your bad luck. This post aligns with forum guidelines and it will not be deleted. You’re selling a used part, and the context regarding how you received it (and why you’re selling it) is relevant. Although we generally discourage public posting of private messages. 

@willpark16 don’t be an alextech. Contact @Mikenopolis and settle this pls. You know that our community doesn’t tolerate dodgy business behavior. We’ll suspend your account if this isn’t resolved.

Thanks Jaime. 

There was no intention of suspending his account. I posted this to take the loss and explain to potential buyer of what to expect which is something he should’ve done. There could be various reasons for him to not respond. One of which is rudeness and age (not that it’s an excuse) but maybe this will give him a chance to redeem himself. 

I do plan to learn battery building skill at psychotiller’s and help with those EXO battery packs when the cells come in.

If he isn’t banned, he should at least be prohibited from selling parts on here. Not cool to string members along like this. If he was communicating, maybe it would be a different story.

Aaaaaaaaand not to play devil's advocate or anything but realistically we can only make assumptions what his intentions were... Be it ignorance, immaturity, needing money, not caring, wanting to sell someone a battery, needing to get rid of it to take his date out to a nice dinner and a down payment on financial for an engagement ring (I know, a bit young), make a car payment, busy with school work or work, dog lost an arm and has to pay for prosthetics, paying for grandmother's cancer treatment out of goodwill and in the dread of the moments didn't realize what other people thought would be good info should maybe be shared....

Really we can *only* assume. Mike has had contact with the guy, so I'd assume mike can probably assume the most accurately... But still . . I hope whatever the guys going through that it comes to terms with the side of the community as a whole as well.

Its a lot of stuff to go into detail here but I am just stating my opinion and @Mikenopolis has been a cool guy/honest/patient enough since day 1. @willpark16 make contact with us and face this like an adult.

It’s not a “zero consequence” situation. If @Mikenopolis had decided to press charges, then he could still get his money back whether @willpark16 is a minor or not. He simply decided to be kind. In addition, based on Will’s actions in this situation the moderators will be determining new restrictions for him regarding business transactions, as well as possible suspension.

On a personal note, I guess it’s a sort of dilemma. I’m a minor, and I’ve done several sales on the forum (not as a business though). I think that regardless of your age, the expectations on the forum are:

- that the seller is transparent as to potential flaws of the item(s) as well as the age of said goods
-that the customer makes him/herself aware of the condition of goods 
- PayPal business or another secure form of payment is used in the transaction

If these expectations are met, there is a far lower chance that something will go wrong. I’ve been here for quite a while as both a member and moderator, and I don’t believe that many of the adults here treat me any differently because of my age. I am thankful for that, and I attribute that to fair and honest behavior in regular communication and transactions (from both parties)

Thanks for splitting the battery discussion vs sale. The battery is pending sale at the moment and I’ll be dropping it off at psychotiller’s place on Friday for buyer’s pick up. 

I’ve spoken to Miguel who said the port was not from his busted board, which mean Will might just have a collection of old parts that he used. I happened to get the short end on the stick. Decided to get a refund that he said was going to happen. If the history of this battery was mentioned I would never have been the buyer due to my paranoid self. So taking the $200 lost or potentially more is on me for my trust in him. Lesson learned. PayPal as goods and services with credit card for full protection going forward with him is the only way to go

To me it seems like he gone ghost either due an incident or him scrambling to acquire the funds necessary to do a refund. Hell his phone bill might not be paid if he’s that kind of minor. I’m sure it’ll all work it self out

[quote="briman05, post:18, topic:64666"]

[/quote]

With the private communications I’ve had with other guys here. He’s had some pretty iffy transactions with others. 

I wouldn’t say for certain that he purposely attempted to scam me. If he had used a NEW charge port, this probably wouldn’t have happened. The busted LCD and ghetto taped switch is off putting but not anything one can’t improve. I did see this thing prior to payment. Sadly didn’t notice Miguel’s address in the box until well after. 

The issue is that he promised a refund. I even said I only wanted $460 instead of the $500 becuase it was my paranoia that makes me refuse to use the battery after burning my finger. He ignored my message for a few days after Dave suggested I take that refund. When I messaged him again a few days later telling him that iOS actually says “read” when you view a message. He replied, then turned turned the feature off....or lost his phone, or died? If alive. He could’ve easily contacted me here. 

His being here for 3 years and an active member is why I paid cash.  Maybe this is an out of ordinary life issue that’s beyond his control which is another reason I can only speculate the lack of communication on his part and the money is not large enough for me to sue a kid

A trend I've noticed a lot on this forum is that people like to over represent themselves when they are in fact just one person, and in this case, a single high schooler. 

Case in point the famous Alextech, and willpark who has as his avatar "will tech industries". From the very beginning, I would be cautious about dealing with anyone who does this as it just seems shady.

Or maybe its a joke thats going over my head... cause its just plain silly that a high schooler has time for school and run an "industry" :rofl::joy::rofl::joy:

Yes there are some who have had a great track record but from a legal standpoint is where I am looking at.  Like @Fiori said they shouldnt even have a a paypal account.  Its not fair for the minors on here that have done business with others on here and have never had issues but its the ones that have the issues that ruin it for everyone just like everything else all it takes is one person to ruin it

Or better yet, enforce a public feedback system. Where people can post good or bad experiences with sellers and vendors.
 
Only now that this has been made public are others openly saying they have also had trouble with this kid, yet until now it has all been kept private.
How many other people on the forums are operating in a similar way but no one knows because it is all kept private.

That thread is a waste of time.  
https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/trusted-sellers-and-builders-these-people-will-not-rip-you-off/48508/57?u=moros
here is the poll for the very person this thread is about, with 2 votes and both positive.  It was even started by the person who had a bad experience with him.

Yet this thread has more people saying they've had bad experiences with him but that poll gives no hint at that.

If there is no feedback about why is was a good, bad or neutral experience then it is pointless. Also if no one actually bothers to hunt down a poll that they don't know about it is also pointless.

The only people in that thread that have anything worth while are the popular sellers that everyone already knows about that are good and trusted.

What are you talking about?! Already have a customer base? Do you know how hard I've worked for the credability that I have? 

My point is, Misrepresentation is a red flag. He has no votes because he has no customers. And the few customers he's had don't seem to be that happy. 
Slapping an Industries after your name doesn't make you a vendor. And someone saying they're open for business doesn't make them qualified. 

TIme does. 

So don't discount the hard fucking work that LHB, RedEmber, Enertion, Psychotiller, Jlabs, Carvon, and others have put in to make this what it is.

And so you know...Two thumbs down isn't positive

Have you read something wrong?
This whole "discussion" are are having is about having a transparency for the way sellers behave on this forum.
Not everyone lives here reading every thread and knows everything about everyone. 
You seem to be caught up on some poll thread that is practically worthless for anything outside the top vendors on the forum.
Why are you against the idea of having a more substantial way to leave feedback for sellers and vendors that actually highlights the positive or negative experience that buyers have experienced?

[quote="psychotiller, post:37, topic:64666"]

All I want is a better way to highlight experiences with sellers and vendors.
If Enertion is well known for slow shipping that takes months despite promises that everything is in stock and ready to ship, then I think that should be shared.
Just that same that I think small sellers like Will that acts bigger than he is, is actually some 16 year old kid that has ripped off a handful of people.

Turns out the poll thread has more merit that I gave it credit for.

I still think a better system for vendor and seller feedback that actually gives reason for positive and negative experiences is more beneficial to both (honest) sellers and buyers.

Somehow, even though I never had anything to do with this battery it keeps returning to my shop..

Today, @trancejunkiexxl showed up to work on his 4wd Carvon build. He was hoping we could make use of this big ass pack. I wanted to remove the 2 pounds of tape on it to make sure we wouldn't have any sketchy issues down the road and as it was it looked even worse than I previously thought.  One of the nickel strips melted as we looked at it. ![will%20battery%202|690x411](upload://8Cr4b5YSKwxozqxWlkgYHJl301d.jpg)![will%20battery|690x411](upload://wfCok0guUeWp4ZJBKIHHUbpOBW4.jpg)![will%20battery%203|666x500](upload://h5vCTUpu9PRNW3xrBI4ZzZqqEzX.jpg)![Will%20battery%204|666x500](upload://pWBkesDxdezKE92XduUaUrTnlSI.jpg)

We decided to set it aside and use a different pack. 6 hours later, as Tony was loading up his car, I told him I was going to put the Willpark pack out in the back yard. And when I picked it up, It burned the shit out of a couple of my fingers! We hustled it outside and began to dismantle it as fast as we could.

One of the mosfets on the bms burst. The pack was starting to throw sparks and every step of the way seemed to be getting worse.. Half ASS doesn't even begin to describe how this pack was rebuilt and repaired. 

The 2 super thin bus bars that the positive and negative battery leads were attached to had no fishpaper under them. No insulation. Just capton tape which was worn through and was shorting through the battery casing. Also, the bus bars were literally a mm apart. 

While trying to stop the pack from shorting the negative terminal fell off. 

This whole "situation" was a joke. Start to finish. None of it funny.

More pics of the lawn dismantle are coming.

If that box it came with didn’t have Miguel and Bara’s address label on it...and that charge port didn’t burn my finger this wouldn’t distroyed my board, burn down my office where I ride to on weekends or worst yet burn down my house with my family in it.

Imagine if @trancejunkiexxl wasn’t using Dave’s professional services and I was to ship this to the buyer directly or to Bara in Chicago. It would take down a UPS facility or a truck. 

The only good thing to come from his “repair” was that it didn’t burn down my office sitting there for a month waiting for the promised refund that never came. It didn’t catch fire in my trunk going to Dave’s place. And it didnt burn down his house which is also his shop.

Maybe it’s just not my cup of tea😂 but I am very concerned about the pack construction if he allowed for that cell to continue to be used. You may not have seen all the battery fires occurring but I’m trying to prevent another one with this pack that has been essentially punctured and welded shut. But I would assume over time this or if enough amps are run through the battery, he will have a nice bonfire

Just a suggestion, maybe in order to sell on this forum there needs to be some sort of 'tier' system....like a first time seller or someone starting out, needs to have 10 successful and trouble-free transactions of a value of 50USD or less in order to move to the next tier, etc etc before they can sell more expensive items.

It needs refinement and input from this community, but it seems a possibly safer option than just outright alienating all the minors because of several bad seeds.

And JEESH at that battery pack, glad it didn't burn anyone's house down...what the heck is up with such lousy battery-making anyway....talk about half-assing the attempt to make sure the battery was safe to use.

That's a pretty good idea! But what about people that want to sell well made battery packs? They have to sell small items before they can sell what they actually want to sell? But on the other hand they can't scam a ton of money in the beginning. I also think it would destroy the group buy concept. A lot of people that make group buys have never sold anything.

@Blitz very true. My dad and mom are different and I’m more my dad. Mom has a short fuse, she would’ve choked him out. But you get what I meant. He’s probably beyond parenting  intervention at this point. 

@sender his handle has been mentioned enough times for his alert to show up if and when he shows up. Maybe he died. It’s possible since he’s been missing for so long. 

@L3chef I called a few times. Texted a few times. He just ghosted. @trancejunkiexxl dm’ed me and purchased the battery with an agreement that it would be going to Dave for inspection, repair and his custom build. Dave called me yesterday and told me what happened and the goal at this point is to salvage what he can. Will’s ghetto bridges literally ripped off with the tape. Tape is not suppose to be stronger than a solder joint!

It does need refinement and it will suck for the honest people out there who develop and sell their products to us (ESCs, battery makers for example), and it's sad that more regulation is needed to prevent these kind of scams and bullshitting, but sometimes what needs to be done, needs to be done.

I think for now, the most important and feasible thing any of us can do at this point are two things : 
1. Use a payment service that has BUYER PROTECTION!!
        Example : Paypal Goods and Services option (this is already default here on the forums but some    
                         people still don't opt in)
2. Don't use cash unless the recipient has a long and current history of successful and non-problematic
    transactions.

Alright guys I have a bit of a dilemna. I have purchased multiple batteries that Will has either touched or built himself. I've not had a bad experience with Will and I'm not looking to pile on , however I'm terrified right now. I live in a tiny condo and if something were to happen it would be awful. Also I'm a total newb when it comes to battery building, so I don't know how to visually diagnose my battery packs...I feel really irresponsible and stupid now. Any advise or help would be greatly appreciated. I do feel with some research I could be capable of this, it's just all the battery building info on this site is so spread out and sometimes contradictory.

If none of the packs are new and you've previously ridden them hard enough to cause flex and shift your likely all good. That being said, likely is no sure thing. 

If your not familiar with battery pack construction I would suggest finding someone local who is and have them pull the heat shrink and visually subject each pack to an inspection. If they are good then reapply heat and tide like a beat 😁.

I wouldn’t worry too much if it’s been good. This was a REPAIRED battery. And he just did a bad job on it. I know he has a spot welder (he sold one recently) so why he decided to use solder is beyond me. Also instead of bridging in the center on the cell terminal he did it on the edges. So one strip of copper or nickel was above four cells. Potential of short increases on the positive terminal especially since he used solder.

i think it's worth doing just to learn, and we'd all likely learn.   i dont know what caused that battery to short but surely we can figure out if yours has any risks with good enough photos.  sure fine to remove the big shrink and tape over the whole pack.  dont do it with something metal.  do it carefully and i think you know what to do.  keep all the cells as stationary as possible when you take the tape off to avoid a cell being pulled along with the shrink or tape.  maybe do it outside or somewhere you can contain it if need be until you can rush it outside. 
I dont remember if the 30Qs have a pressure valve but id take it apart in a very quiet place and listen for a possible valve releasing or snapping shorts.  and keep feeling the cells for any possible heat.  the only real dangerous side of the cells is the positive terminal.  the rest of the cell is all negative and just that little bit of insulation (or i see at least there are donuts on the positive so that's a big plus)

-Crash #1
 
-Sent to Bara for repair.

-Sent back to Miguel

-Crash #2

-Asked Dave/Psychotiller for repair (not within his budget) and decided to quit Esk8? Will got a hold of it

-sold to me for $500 without history and charge port burnt my finger. 

-I sold it to Antonio (@trancejunkiexxl) with this story for $300 who asked me to take it to Dave for inspection and repair

@willpark16 part of regaining trust will be about total transparency and honesty in everything. So:

Have you given @Mikenopolis a full refund?

Total transparency was that I was not made aware myself of the full history of the battery and  was led to believe and inspection ahead been done by a trusted forum member prior to my own, I had planned on leaving the forum for a bit prior to the mike Situation and the two were in no way correlated. Truth is I left mike out to dry handling my own issues, and communication in regards to the refund ceased because I had been busy and not being on the forum didn’t see how this all played out. I’m not saying what I did in the past was right but all I’m able to do is work toward fixing my mistake and making sure it doesn’t happen again

You definitely owe a bunch of people apologizes dude. I’m pretty sure that mike has said that it would have been nice to have the refund. Psychotiller couldn’t even save the battery.
Until you have gained the proper knowledge and technique I would stay away from building batteries.

Mike is a cool ass dude and much more forgiving/understanding/patient than most. Myself included.

It isn't that it was inherently malicious... originally.  

But things such as a refund date had been decided upon.  That has nothing to do with being on the forum or not.

I do respect (just a little) that you are back here under the same name and are brave enough to want to be part of the community still.

I think if Mike doesn't want the refund, that is obviously his prerogative.  However, it would be a swell gesture to take some money and donate it a nonprofit of Mike's choosing.

The actions you made aren't something that you should just be able to walk away from without some type of recourse.

If Mike doesn't agree, thats cool.


But, The Wounded Warrior Foundation could always use a donation from a wayward son looking for redemption.

That's not entirely correct. @Mikenopolis is honerable and not going hungry, so he feels the noble action is to let it go. I applaud him for that. 

The minimum you could do is refund him the difference from what he paid you plus what he spent to make the battery usable minus what he sold the remaining parts for. 

If that doesn't happen then frankly I won't support you selling anything here ever again. Not like it's my choice, but I will speak against allowing it. 

I'm not trying to pick on you, and I understand you had personal issues happening. But that's not the first instance of a customer issue with you so your history is not stellar.

LMAO. What a convenient reason....( Cough cough... Excuse). The moment you sold the pack to @Mikenopolis you are responsible for being able to response within the period covered for refund. The fact that you went radio silent without telling anyone is called a dick move. If you are trying pull off to regain your reputation it would be a miracle. Quit your BS. And at least admit what actually happened and show some proof. Just because hes either being nice or tired of your shit doesn't mean that you can just not refund cus he said so. Be a man and show that your are responsible for you own mistake.

While I admire your courage in coming back on here, its not our respect and trust you need to win back.  Its the people you ripped off.  Just because someone says don't worry about it does not mean don't worry about it.  This about being a man and not a boy.   You make him take the money.  You hassle him till he gives you his bank details and pay him in parts.  You do things for the man.  Yard work, anything.  This is how you own a mistake and this is how you gain respect.  Good on you for manning up so far now man up completely.

It not much about the amount of money. I am guessing he wouldn't care about that amount of money. Paying him back is to show that you are owning up your mistake and not just apologizing. First mistake is you bought a defective pack without checking (if that's true according to your words). Second is you went MIA for refund. Third is you are still trying to shake it off as if simiply apologize can solve everything.

This here is the problem
![image|514x327](upload://iMTcOVJ7bqyLmzMsf3P28urySQK.jpeg) 

The situation is not “resolved” as you say. It was tossed in the fire and a major loss of time and money had already happened

In order to resolve this, you need a time machine to unburn fingers and lawns. Or come back as someone else. Leave those steel balls at home. Don’t air it out here. 

The way I see it, If you have another issue like this in the future, your come back needs to be a full refund plus interest. That’s how you start. Not with story or how you basically don’t understand how to read a calendar. This was literally the classic adding insult to injury. 

The refund that’s necessary would be $200 for me. $300 for @trancejunkiexxl and $400 for @psychotiller  cause of injury and labor needed to repair and salvage that sorry excuse of a battery.

What?! I said it was shit and needed rebuilt. I also said he should just get a refund and not waste the time, If anything, you knew this and then chose to resell it making it seem like you had actually done something to repair it. (Actually not doing anything of value, even selling it with the broken display and burned out switch. )

Don't try to bring me into this like I had something to do with it.

On a proper sales contact perspective, you don't need to repay psychotiller and trance since it was their choice of working together to revive the pack. Yes thats they could've given up at the beginning and play safe. But I don't think you are at a good stand on this. You broke the contract which triggered this series of events. Therefore you a liable for it partially if not at the full amount. You know, that is how companies get sue in the adult world. Try to pull that off as a LLC and you are boned af.

Nobody. Exiled top never brought it to me to look at it. I told him on the phone, knowing how bad the accident was that it would probably need to be rebuilt. I told him my charge would be $250 to repair it. He never brought it up in conversation again.
Any talk of me saying it was fine, is complete bullshit. And the battery was so bad there's no way anyone reselling it is innocent. Claimed confusion or not.
