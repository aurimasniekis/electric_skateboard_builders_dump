I was wondering what is the size and measures of the countersunk flat head bolts used in Longboarding/Skateboarding? Can't seem to find anything related in the forum. Could anyone provide a chart with the complete measures of every section of the standard Longboard/Skateboard countersunk flathead bolt?

ok so the length is dependent on if you have risers or not. personally i have 32mm long bolts. I'll grab a bolt and measure it up for you in a few minutes

its just your standard m5 bolt as you choose the length (if you have a 10mm riser like me i use 32mm long)

Most of the kits I see are 8-24 countersink bolts in  lenghts from 1 inch to 1 & 3/4 inches.

They should be all 10-32 machine screws. I have bought 10-32 to replace my standard stock longboard hardwares.

Those are metric? The typical skate hardware are imperial screws with 10/32 thread as far I know.
