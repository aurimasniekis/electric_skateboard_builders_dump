Hey, i'm currently designing a panel mount for my AS150 loopkey and looking for someone to 3d print it. Final version must be PETG or ABS if you can print ABS, the "beta" versions can be PLA.

So i'm looking for someone that has a AS150 lying around for testing prupose (tolerances) ...but not required.

The dimensions are 38x55mm

If no one else replies, I have access to a bunch of 3D printers at my university, but I won’t have time until later next week if that’s okay.

They have a little shop their where you can get whatever filament you want.

@Hannes,  Where are you at?
I don't have an AS150 laying around.  
What CAD software are you using.  If you are in the US, I could probably  through it on the printer this morning.
Just looking at your image.  A Chamfer, or fillet right here would keep me from having to add supports.  
Supports wont hurt, but  PETG supports are pretty sticky...  and can be difficult to remove.  (not sure your clearances.).

If you are in the eu I could print it for you in PLA, Abs and Petg... :smile:

Unfortunately i'm not in the US, i'm in Sweden.
I'm using Autodesk inventor Professional, yes, i might extend the part a bit to allow a fillet there it's just that i want to keep the length inside the enclosure at a minimum. i'll look at a design revision.
