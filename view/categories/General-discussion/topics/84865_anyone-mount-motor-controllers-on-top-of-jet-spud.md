Looking for more battery space underneath. I have a little SE56 case I could fit the focboxes in. Pros? Cons?  Pictures of it done?  Thanks

why would you want to mount " [Anyone Mount Motor Controllers on top of Jet Spud?](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/anyone-mount-motor-controllers-on-top-of-jet-spud/84865)" when you can fit a 12s6p and dual focboxes underneath the deck? :sweat_smile:

i think hes trying to fit more than 12s6p under the deck :joy::rofl::rofl::smirk:

or maybe he dosent know you can even fit 12s6p on the spud, in the first place.

Who would possibly ride a fully charged 12s6p till it dies on a spud of all boards.... 

even better question is why the hell would anyone need more than that

I have an eboosted Enclosure that fits 10s3p, bms, and dual focboxes. I have enough batteries for a 12s4p. Focboxes go up top = more battery space. Also I will be using Pneumatics

I can think of one reason to do it...

8in MBS Wheels on Matrix 2 or SR trucks with ling axles, bindings and a fat double stack battery. That's an if road beast.  

You can mount the ESCs in the center in a small box with the volt meter and switch centrally located. The more I think about it the copper it sounds ðŸ˜ƒ

what kind of angles/risers would you need to run 8in wheels on a spud? I was just playing with the idea of gummies on it but I expect it to bite easily
