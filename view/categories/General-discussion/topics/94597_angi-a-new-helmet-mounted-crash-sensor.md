I just received an email from Specialized.

There seems to be a new helmet mounted crash sensor.

It is placed on your helmet and in the event of a crash, it automatically calls your pre-designated contacts unless you abort in a certain period of time.

Since it uses your mobile phone, no subscription is required.

No reason. This is why I wrote helmet mounted crash sensor and not helmets with crash sensor.

Specialized makes bike helmets which are not always suitable for our application but since they sell the sensor as a stand alone for $50, I think it is a good deal.

was just about to order one, reviews make me worry a little -  still think its might be worth the risk (if mounted right)

Most negative reviews seem to be about the fact that you either need a Specialized helmet or double sided tape to attach it.

I believe most people in this forum have the DIY skills to make a 3d printed bracket or come with some sort of solution.

I actually tried this at work several month ago. You do need a subscription or some kind of payment other than $50 msrp. The sensor will send signal to your phone then your phone will send a email with your gps location if it senses a sudden rotation.

I wish there was an open source version that could be added to existing Esk8 apps.
