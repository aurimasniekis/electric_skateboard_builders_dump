Please travel slower or tie them to your hubs. <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/1/1/1181c50c30f9f20de53e45f12c1606f5eec66798.jpg" width="689" height="390"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/1/c/1cf7966e409156d6adb4e6ff4ae70abf3e7845c4.jpg" width="689" height="390">

I've had a flat tire on my board when the original plastic rims broke. That was fun enough. I'd hate to have a tire just pop off.

On another note, if it weren't such a pain to change tires on the sixshooters, I'd consider getting a set of these airless tires and studding them for winter riding.

We weren't on it. I put them on this board and my Brother in Law was going to test it. I turned it on, spun it up and the wheel expanded and left the hub. The durometer is so soft they just stretch out bigger than the sidewall of the hub. Quite a surprise! But no glory haha!

Huh?! It's easy to change tires on the new sixshooters. 6 screws. I dare say much easier than using a tire tool and prying a tire off of plastic hubs.

If you're on the wheel, then there can't be any seperation in that spot because your weight is overcoming the wheel's tendency to stretch outward. That being said the wheel has a chance of falling off right before the contact patch and right after. Either way it's a scary idea that I wouldn't want to test

When you stand on the truck, the truck applies your weight to the wheel, which applies your weight to the tire. There is a force pushing the wheel into the tire into the ground. Does that make any sense?
```

## \#22 Posted by: psychotiller Posted at: 2017-12-08T04:28:55.218Z Reads: 261

@ugothakd No because that doesn't negate the outward force all the way around the wheel. Only on the bottom. Spinning is still happening whether you're on it or not.

The bead of the hub on the new wheel is larger though. And the hub is 2mm narrower tightening up the fit. The durometer is way softer than I thought. If it isn't different than yours, you should be careful. Or do what I did and tie that wheel down. It's easy with the sixshooter.

I'll be careful, didn't even think about that happening. I'll prolly use some zip ties as well. After Christmas I'm gonna get a new set of 6 shooters, I'll be doing away with the wobblies as I've experimented on them to the point that I'm gonna have to do some welding soon ðŸ˜Š

so aside from the limited top speed, How do the airless tires compare to old pneumatics?

ride feel? control? traction? efficiency?

## \#31 Posted by: psychotiller Posted at: 2017-12-08T22:52:34.541Z Reads: 205

They don't compare. They weigh 4lbs more than a set of sixshooters, roll like they are dragging something and can't roll as fast because they'll expand off the hub just like all our favorite hubmotors.

They do look kinda cool though so I'm going to leave them on my Bane build. (With zip ties)

Back before my day tubeless tires were bound to wheels using an internal metal wire. The tires were cut to fit and bound at the seam by twisting the wire. I think heat was also applied to seal/bond the seam also.

Anytime I see a non-bonded rubber tire that does not rely on air pressure to hold the tire in place I think of this old technique and the not so obvious reason it was used and needed.

Ive seen, handled and ridden the six shooters a few times now. Definately top notch construction and I can say that they were lighter and have stronger sidewalls than any of the 8" tires im using now. Off hand, rolling resistnce seems on par with other pnematics Ive tired but Id really like to see some 6-shooter whr/mile numbers vs Urathane vs, other pneumatic tires. That would be some valuable info imo. If they actually do get less flats than other pnematics then thats a huge selling point for me as well since I pretty much get a flat on every ride I do  and Im sick of it ðŸ˜¡.

I've only tested mine. But I can't imagine it could be any different with different hubs. The durometer would be the same. This urethane isn't staying on anything when it's spinning fast. Same issue as all the ghosting hub motors

nope as the truck is connected to the hub so the pressure on the bottom of the wheel means less contact on the top meaning more likely to get the tyre come half off then full off (much like driving on a flat tyre) and bang ugothakd is in surgery

This actually makes perfect sense. Just like when you have a flat tire. Only the bottom is flat! Am I right?

Did some hubmotor with epoxied thane failed at high speeds before? Here though the mechanical pressure fit seems to be pretty strong between the hubs, just the thane wheel may stretch a bit at high speed and lose the mechanical fit. Epoxy should be strong enough to hold it down and not lose the fit. Or maybe no? Just throwing out the idea.
