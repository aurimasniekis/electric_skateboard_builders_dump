What’s the best orientation for the motor wires on this kit.  This is how i’ve mounted the motor with the wires going back and up to the deck.  I’m concerned as I can’t secure them to the deck here where they  pass under the motor as they need space to move as truck tilts over that they will end up snagging on spinning motor housing.   Is there anything wrong with them coming forwards.  I think I'm going to rotate the motor 90 degrees and have the wires coming forwards and up to the deck.
Thanks.![image|666x500](upload://eFRgNUiVekMftRYGU9KKyNraCyQ.jpeg)![image|666x500](upload://bSb5SguuvTmGED0LJ8xtU2TTQjp.jpeg) kit
