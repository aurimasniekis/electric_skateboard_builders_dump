salutation riders!

got a chance to hangout with @lowbudgetguy yesterday :) 
I gotta say, his dual hubs are freakin ninjas! couldÂ´nt hear em. my chain drive sounded more like a
turbine especially when accelerating - lowbudgetguy said he liked how it sounded :laughing: yep,
me too buddy...me too.

**[hereÂ´s a short clip 360Â° VR of our epic ride :rofl:. enjoy!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM4P3Ggbd4o&t=17s)**

@rich
hope you get your motor soon and get your board working again! weÂ´ll organize another meet and ride!

Nice!

Looking forward to join the group and to finish another street/AT build so I should always have at least 1 running board :wink:.

Are 2 people a group or is it a pair ride? :thinking::rofl:

yeah, its a nice city. esk8ing isnt "outlawed" yet (well it isnt legal either - were just beeing tolerated for now as no negative headlines hit the news so far) . i'm seeing more and more people on esk8s though so i guess its just a matter of time until we get noticed by the "law". things tend to get over regulated here...specially when its fun.

I have to agree with @slick IÂ´m living on the outskirts of Vienna and things really tend to get over-regulated :smile:

well lets hope it does not start snowing :smile:

I also invited a friend of a friend who rides a boosted board but i donÂ´t know if heÂ´ll come to ride (donÂ´t know him personally)

I always wanted to race a boosted board and see if the range holds true to what they claim. so 7miles/ ca. 11km if its a gen 1 boosted (which if true heÂ´ll be pushing for a km)

*edit*
whats the top speed on a gen1 boosted?

any other riders from vienna we can invite?

Yup,  

@rich and I ran into two other guys with esk8s yesterday - one had an evolve and the other had a loaded deck with a mellow drive. turned out to be a group ride after all :smile:

btw. rich - theres a short clip of you riding through grass at around sec.30

How many people from Vienna are still active? Spring is approaching fast and the weather is becoming better and better and a group ride would be great. :slight_smile:

(Sorry for bumping an old thread :slight_smile:)

here, still alive. 

stationed in vienna BUT since rented e-scooters started showing up late last summer I decided to
take a small break. I decided to wait and observe how things develop between e-scooters and cyclists (you know what I mean if you live in vienna). Anyway, an new Flipsky FSESC 4.12 with aluminium case 
is on the way and IÂ´m starting to think about riding again...well, that is, after observing how good e-scooters and cyclists co-exist (e-scooters are legaly considered as bicycles now in vienna - ek8s are still in a gray area?).

I know what you mean. How many riders in Graz? Ive seen a guy on an evolve here in vienna a few weeks ago. Im not sure how many are active in the forum...up to now i only met two forum members in person. The two others  in the video (guys with no helmets) were chance encounters. Dunno if they hang around here.
