I want to see your road to esk8. Mine is a very sad and tragic beginning... A scooter.

**January 2018**

I eventually see this instructable and it all begins.
https://www.instructables.com/id/DIY-Electric-Skateboard/

I joined up and hid in the shadows like a true n00b, gathering intel until I could start asking half stupid questions instead of whole stupid questions.

It rides! My love for esk8 is confirmed and I set out to change the scooters original SLA batteries to lithium ion.

**June 2018**

Aliexpress packs are junk. Voltage drops off when removed from charger. The weight offset from SLA is too great so I start looking into a real build and find you all. Plus my tire blew.

I got my non electric parts at a sweet deal. Dude on ebay happened to live an hour away from me. I offered a low ball price to pick it up, he accepted. We both got flagged for not using their platform :rofl: 

![20181118_113808|281x500](upload://40i7smtQIHCFa0e2UshHYWF7jSE.jpeg)

**December 2018**

My plan is set, parts list made, and esk8 Christmas is epic.\

**February 2019**

My first TRUE board is made. I have a plan to fully revamp everything and build a second board (never happened to you I'm sure).
![20190211_145726|281x500](upload://30p9cQTtqplk1CN0UVoIKZybpkP.jpeg)

It rides like a beauty. Thank you to everyone here for all the help, insight, wisdom, compassion, selflessness, and laughs. This is a truly wonderful community and I probably couldn't have done it without you!

The year was 2012, I was 15 and got one of those plastic penny boards. Somehow young me was able to skate this for 15km-ish distances and was fine. I can't do that now![1|498x500](upload://vrfi2PZz2PwaQAWmVbuU1dxv57x.png) 

Then in 2016 i built a deck out of some really dense wood for a longboard. Dense woods are not ideal... this was also flat so 0 concave.
![2|498x500](upload://lO3Ae4QqbCytEcNxDHGnV4mE1Ld.png) 

Later in the year i built a dancer board. Tried a cross step, fell, and never did that again.![3|500x500](upload://yXwyq3ffqvukcywBlSnWJQ9eIY2.png) 

Late 2017, got a Leafboard, a single 5065 integrated little cruiser board from a crowdfunding.![4|498x500](upload://zl8yVfNYgDjLjZR8tzMmhIjaJdw.png) 

Feb 2018, Leafboard broke down so i built a dual 6355 DIY (**finally**)![5|629x500](upload://9R7jYbBL3Ykg7hTrpQDUaHNiqB6.png) 

And this is the board now, probably swapped almost everything from the first version..![20190303_153542|690x388](upload://kfTsZid162zcqYlA2U0rncTjTo0.jpeg) 

June 2018, built a 10s3p single 6374 Jet spud![20180616_183046|690x388](upload://7t92qcTeDiu3BLKVY1U9nY3qMYK.jpg) 

And also recently makeover-ed this.![20181215_183717|690x388](upload://3LEQt328gTR3OQzy3oYYiY28Gd3.jpeg) 

October 2018, built a dual 6380s on 12s5p AT board.![20190208_160034|690x388](upload://ek4w8ZByw4q0ICkHnXgxMi094gx.jpeg) 

And just a couple weeks back, a light weight 5kg board, single 6355, on 7s2p.
![20190309_103037|690x388](upload://6f4xwGrcKnzk78CQKY30APE2Otd.jpeg) 

What's next? **uh probably a vertical rack for all these boards**

I found Boosted in late 2016 and fel in love. Then realized my wallet was full of dust... And I moved to Brazil.
April 2017 I found the forum. And August moved to UK.
January 2018 I built my board, 10s, single 190kv, Brakeboard trucks.
![IMG_20180107_163032|690x193](upload://vwcclGT0cygIcTuSltnWGDUyTXM.jpg) ![IMG_20180107_163405|690x185](upload://zGbWHbdn3ApzDzdUoNFN1zoohpi.jpg) 
Then in February I moved to Iceland.
September 2018 I got my LaSag'ne
![IMG_20180929_174845_HDR|690x388](upload://8GvZ7E0IvMDKCBb9kAGTRE1gQpK.jpeg)

I haven't got any photos of my very first or second board, however starting with my third it is still as sketchy looking as most people 1st lol. 

![IMG_1108|375x500](upload://46i1JpcSPIuihe0nDSe0C9yORE5.jpeg) 
![IMG_1110|375x500](upload://skBQeeN4gMqXtBeA1X7Hp3NLDfk.JPG)
![IMG_1115|375x500](upload://Ns8czg14murcOwqU2eJ5nAkqv6.jpeg) 

So my fourth board was pretty much my first/second board on a shorter deck, 20" to be precise. ![IMG_1140|375x500](upload://2N5Y5AFgexRPF7TUGr9VilZwfVj.JPG) ![IMG_1164|375x500](upload://qgPdmsfFnIJgxnRd2CdHiaLaI3t.JPG) 

The 5th board is pretty much just as swap of the decks again with a new battery and enclosure
![680BB53C-ED93-4E73-84A0-D06ADE0E4C02|374x500](upload://721wzVftJomTxyh9altM6VolK3n.jpeg)
![IMG_1649|375x500](upload://aTs5YDQub6X0CUe86ORVjwppOVA.JPG) 
![IMG_1650|375x500](upload://nYOKrLRHeYEnWQoofYpKb7END8P.JPG) 
![BBB28749-1846-4E67-9EAD-C408A4B11D6C|375x500](upload://xtUwKDqRzei3N9H5h84plxpDAyz.jpeg) 

The 5th board then had a whole new drive train swapped on, classic case of buy cheap buy twice!
For some reason I can't find any pics of this but it ain't hard to use our imagination.

6th board is up next, this ones my favourite by far, I used much better quality parts and got a much better quality board.

![IMG_1861|425x500](upload://ogbRrbxbNA2KP2T5o7fZp5GJ67C.jpeg) 
![F5630AA9-9B45-43D3-B904-B835075419CB|374x500](upload://jQ3jcrcUYaaz0kiAjatHlX3B91T.jpeg)

7th board is still in the makings, I need to fibreglass the deck first and get the new power button. I also then might swap on my DD and a 4.2 upgraded. Or I'll just make an 8th build :grin:

![B175D618-35E8-489D-AF5E-83607005528F|409x500](upload://bGd57XgkDh1mmJMywp7Iw7bb1dI.jpeg)

Thanks for reading my story :slightly_smiling_face:

2017 - i didn’t know anything about esk8.
2018 - got a boosted board in February. Mainly to commute to the train and from train to work.
I even don’t remember what was first, but somehow I found this forum in April 17 and some @Nowind videos popped up my YouTube feed.
That was the point where I got trapped into diy.
Started with an urban carve
![image|374x500](upload://aXOPh6QbkXWGUlgNcmXMr0yjQLw.jpeg) 

Which caught on fire because I was just a stupid noob...
At this time I was close to break up with all the diy stuff. A fire at home is something I really don’t wish anybody.
But I also had most parts for my quad on order, so I took a small break to think about all and started from scratch after a 3weeks vacation.

My second build was a first dual than quad trampa
![image|375x500](upload://1ODlrmksjtq7ry400g5mEZ9amTq.jpeg) 

Some unfortunate circumstances lead me to a second trampa. I decided to go the light way for that one, so here we are, the still in progress light white jump board 
![image|375x500](upload://djUweGTdvcskxZeUe7Qex7XEAGg.jpeg) 

For 2019 there are some more things planned, but I still wait for parts to arrive.

![IMG_20180528_193700_173|500x500](upload://e6nHLeFWlniIqks6AHML51ywkUH.jpg) 
This happened shortly after lol
(As most of you know) 

![IMG_20180721_023407_475|500x500](upload://od5fv0xWV2guXXQFDueeAj0wu4I.jpg) 

Upgraded board to tkp surfrodz with tiller mounts, 97mm abec 11s and bkb press fit pulleys. 

![IMG_20181102_081642_215|500x500](upload://hlXNR5ORzkbNBKiO7ecJPiq43wq.jpeg) 

I've still got more plans for this pre built board. 
(6355 maytechs,  dual vesc, 30q battery)

But since then i did my first diy build.

![IMG_20190316_091349_569|500x500](upload://x5A3QiVzqkuycWjHHmFjXodI7Hp.jpeg) ![IMG_20190315_084154_339|500x500](upload://kpuOYGD2CvMCykpGATBdqu3AqFK.jpeg) ![IMG_20181103_173755_989|375x375](upload://kVQVhfNjQXXs8gyMP69bq2dHznj.jpeg) ![IMG_20181103_173755_988|500x500](upload://6SDVKoVt6TbAX8AoU663UwOunRp.jpeg) 

It's had several makeovers lol.
Hummie deck,  rkp and tkp depending on the week lol.
Tiller mounts,  sometimes 107mm sometimes 145 haggy pneumatic tires. 
A 12s4p from psychotiller and dual focboxes. 
It's got changes coming as well.
