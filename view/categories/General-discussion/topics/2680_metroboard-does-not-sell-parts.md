I tried buying the abec11 metal pulley and have been denied.

"Unfortunately we don’t sell spare parts to non-Metroboard customers.

 

I will refund your money for this order."

metroboard doesnt like money, screw those guys.
I just wanted to share this so nobody else wastes time.

What if one of us buys a metroboard and then buys extra parts and sells them?

Im sure an order for pulleys each week wil alert the propriatary police. If i had the money id buy one just to get the parts and return it. I want a 15mm metal abec pulley and nobody seems to actually list them on their website.  Yes, i see them in builds, i know people have them but i have not found a place to buy one. My 12mm enertion set is on the way. It will work for now.

why do you want to buy their metal pulley?

if you want to deal with a parts supplier, look here

You shipped my 12mm kit about 12 hours ago. I ride really hard and i dont believe the plastic pulley will survive long enough when i joyride. I want the 15mm and all metal for when i start hitting gaps and staircases.

you will be surprised how soft aluminium is....

the plastic ones are actually tougher material... they probably will last longer.

@thisrealhuman lecdec did the same thing to me when I tried to order "their" remote, which is just a generic remote that they use in their builds.

...no

If they have any common sense they will make it out of a hard aluminum alloy. But even if it was a softer aluminum, it would still probably be harder than plastic.

Metal > plastic 90% of the time. There are obviously very soft metals such as gold, silver, copper, lead, tin, etc., but besides those, most other metals/metal alloys will beat plastic any day.

haha! 

i wonder how long before Evolve picks up this idea and stops selling their spare parts to builders. 

Fuckem! 

Also yeah, injection molded glass fiber reinforced nylon has a number of advantages over aluminum on wheel pulleys. Not the least of which is not throwing metal shavings into your motor can when the mount mis-aligns and you end up with pulley rub on the mount bolts. And they're quieter. And they wear just as long which is practically forever in both cases. And they look better from the outside. I'm tired of looking at a half dozen bolts on my wheels.

What's funny is metroboard purchased from me in the past. LOL Forgot what though.. Can't recall.

@longhairedboy - Evolve originally didn't sell parts but I think now they have so much parts they figure they might as well just sell it? perhaps..

Good points. Although i think this aluminum is a press fit also, not a bolt on.

You can get pulleys through McMaster.com and SDP-SI (Stock Drive Products)

I'm currently doing an experiment with my boards - I use #25 chain drive rather than pulleys and I made up a set of cogs from Delrin just to see how long they'll last and if they can handle the stress.  I'll report back once I have some miles under them.

So i decided to see if i can crack this company and buy something without an actual board.

sent them an email saying that i bought a board off craigslist, missing the wheels and wheel pulley.

They responded and asked for the serial number, I told them it was painted over :stuck_out_tongue:

Now they want a picture, I took a random screenshot, changed it to .txt, deleted some parts so its broken, and am about to send it.

It will be interesting to see how adamant they are about getting proof that I actually own one. Maybe ill just grab a random picture off the internet.

Good luck, he's a one man show and probably sells a very limited amount of boards. Given the other recent attempt I bet he will have caught on. He's a pretty intelligent guy from my conversations with him..makes it all the more surprising that he is dumb enough not to sell his parts and make money..maybe there's something I don't know though..

LOL this is hilarious. I doubt he saw completely through that unless he found this forum. Its too muddy and he's too busy thinking about old customers to be thinking about a builder. 

at the point where he was like "do you want to waste money on parts that aren't compatible" my answer would be "Yes, thank you. It is my money after all."

Why is he so insistent on verifying that i have a board?

what an asshole :expressionless:  (not you @onloop :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:)


Edit: now i am really tempted to get one, just to send him a picture and shove it in his face. (or if anyone has one or can find a picture of one with an outrunner brushless motor, no wheels, and the battery case painted)

No luck, i said i was buying them as a gift for a friend with a metroboard. He said he needed their name, I refused, and he said he doesn't sell to DIYers.

>Sorry but we don’t have enough inventory to support the general public on spare parts. They are reserved for Metroboard customers only…you can find plenty of other sites that will sell you parts.

I don't know the law in your country but in France, it is strictly forbidden to publish private communications on a public space. 
I also find it very ethically questionable ... to the least.

I can confirm this @torqueboards -  There was a time where I tried to order something from Evolve and couldn't, but since they've changed their policy.

If anyone has any complaints I will take it down or censor it. 

In my view, this is the public PR email for the company, not a private email address, so i see no issue with this.

My advice.. use "he said" before anything you wish to convey on the forum to us and type it in your own words. Don't use the quote function or copy and paste from private messages.

WOW. You all know what we are seeing here. A company that feels threatened enough by the DIY crowd to forego sales to protect sales. HAHAHA...
ESK8 is an emerging market whether anyone likes it or not. Best to get your name out there than to try to control the market. I can't stand stupid corporate style bullshit.

firstly, there is a good chance the metroboard owner is on this forum...

this forum is where all the best ideas are, you would but nuts not to be on here... same goes for all the Kickstarter folks & evolve... I guarantee they would all be on here scouring through the build threads. Just take a look at what evolve is about to release... it looks like something you would see in the build threads on here.

secondly, why doesn't he sell parts? I would think there are two reasons. 1. he thinks people might copy his stuff? 2. He is probably worried about getting a bad reputation on forums like this... or perhaps not a bad reputation, but just that he can't control what is done with the product... so stuff might be used incorrectly and he would then have to answer for it when it doesn't work as it probably would on his builds.... that really is the beauty of conducting business on these forums... It makes it very hard to be a dodgy bastard in a public forum! people will call you out! so you better make sure your kit is the goods... The flip side is that if your kit is the bomb people will also call you out in a positive way Thats what i love about this... its fucking exliterating

Finally... who gives a shit if he won't sell you his stuff, how much of this guys time are you wasting - he said no!... what is so special about his pulley anyway?

@onloop maybe you can create and move this thread to the metroboard category.

Hi Ilan.  Welcome to the builders forum.  I 100% respect what you said.  I apologize for that person pretending to have one of your boards to buy parts, all she had to do was ask if you sell it to DIY builders.

I own one of your boards, and I have found it to be the most reliable and well built out of most of the boards I have.  The motor mounts and pulleys are rock solid! And the move to the new mini controller was excellent.  Don't be surprised if DIY builders want to buy your parts, it only shows that they may be better than other offerings on the DIY market.  To builders here who haven't used a metroboard, I can attest that they use parts that will last much longer than plastic pulleys.  Even the enclosure on the board is rock solid aluminum.  Though all the metal on the board makes it heavy.

Hey All. If you live in the Bay Area and want an old metro board, I'm giving away a beat-up Slim.

It was fun when it was new, but I ran intro problems with the belts and pulleys. And could never keep the right tension on them. Anyway, if you take it, you'll definitely need to put some work into it, but as far as I know the motor, battery, controller, wheels, trucks, bearings and deck are in fine shape.

If you're interested, PM me. And yes, you've gotta come pick it up in San Francisco!
