Good shoes so i can walk my shit back to the truck and take my board back to the lab. 

Although i do tend to carry about 5 allen wrenches and a skate wrench in my pocket usually. IF there's room after i put the skittles and coke in there. 

but in my experience, other than breaking belts, its always something that i actually can't fix in the field anyway, like a fried ESC.

Gaff Tape. If you've never used it, its what stage audio techs use to setup for shows. All the strength of duct tape with almost none of the residue.
