I just came across [THIS][1] on KickStarter. At first I really wanted to like it, not just for night riding also for the daytime; it's supposed to come in a black color too. Then I thought, wait, that doesn't belong in the world of skate. What do you think, is it to dorky. I want to say it is, but my desire not to get ran over is fighting me....

It doesn't look like it'll be funded at this point, but it caught my eye for a moment.

Well, "D" does come before "E" so it makes since. Before "E" electric powered skateboards there where "D" dog power skateboards. I guess the logic brakes down the "H" and human powered, well unless you consider they were "A" as in ass powered...

I wonder what the small dog does for the dork factor... Does it ramp it up, or cancel it out?

Well, they are both better than "C" which I assume means "Cat" power. Unless you're going for the high dork factor. Then getting towed on a board by a cat on a leash might be better. No wait, a herd of cats. Like a dog sled team. No, cat board team....Ok I'll stop now. 

Seriously though, I do "heart" the red brake lights... for someone else.

Wow! that's a show. Did you ever have issues with police? I know many places have laws against using flashing red or blue lights on any "vehicles" other than for use on emergency or law enforcement ones.

mine is blinking multi colour . yellow , red , blue , purple , green ....e.t.c.



not just strobe red & blue .

so its not a problem . it  is therefore encourage to lit at least a torch light so others can see you . and you are visible to others . but i took it up a notch . i went DISCO ! ! !


  :sweat_smile:


singapore police uses red & blue "strobe" blinking mode .

ok .

if you asked " if its DORKY ? "

its up to you .

but there are several other "safety jacket"  out in the web .

if it were in my hands , and it is mine .

i would hack the whole jacket and re positioned  all the LEDs  to my desired choice of placement .

the yellow LEDs i would re positioned them to my elbows and under my wrist .

while the white LEDs i'd put them  center of back jacket .

then again , thats me . just  my honest opinion .

from what fresh hell did this emerge? 

i'd rather dunk myself in electro luminescent paint and skate in glowing naked glory than wear this jacket. 

maybe if it were a black leather biker looking cut with red or purple lights in a very different pattern...

**And if your trying for "electro luminescent paint" you can rip off the sleeves and split the difference.**

i actually like the idea of a water bottle pocket on my lower back. I end up holding it back there when i'm crouching for downhill anyway. 

My kids and i were joking around about installing a cup holder on one of my boards, but if we have a cup holder, we'll probably need a radio and an ashtray to put change in. The idea then rapidly regressed into power chair territory as we kept talking about it. Ideas like a small TV on a stick, a micro bar stocked with tiny bottles of liquor, and a leather seat. 

I made sure to seem confident that we could actually do all of that.

first post..

I think it's a GREAT start. 

I'd also think board commuters will need an under-board projection lighting system that would display turn indicators and other symbols brightly on the payment creating a "virtual perimeter" around the boredCommuter that is highly visible to traffic. Initially, the control could be simple analog selection via the remote. 

When it's realistic to put radar on the commuter boards, I'd like to see the "alert perimeter" (red flashing box around BC) triggered automatically if a traffic object is on a projected collision path with us.

Parting -
The sportbike geek crowd is knocking on the door this type of "advanced safety lighting" (i made that up) with their replacement headlights.

Thanks #nicejob guys with all you are doing!
