Hopefully this isn't a repost ... I remember @chaka [announcing the FreeRides were coming](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/ollinboardcos-freeride-integrated-deck-coming-soon/2058) back at the end of May. I'm a big fan or hollow-core boards so I was excited to see where he's taken this. I was browsing [OllinBoardCompany.com](OllinBoardCompany.com) yesterday and I'm pretty sure I didn't see the FreeRides for pre-order, but this morning this showed up: http://www.ollinboardcompany.com/product/dual-esc-integrated-power-system-longboard-deck

He didn't clarify what gear ratios he is using on that 10s pack.  I spoke to him a long time ago, he said the max speed would be around 24-25 mph.  Of course you could change the wheel pulley.  The range is never ending though...

Correct me if I am wrong but his original freeride was 12s6p. Chaka was probably able to find better prices for the components.

I think @chaka has positioned this well. Rather than 12s6p which would push the price up, they've opted for 10s6p *and* a 2 year warranty. I think a 2 year warranty for consumer products is smart, it shows they have confidence in their components and workmanship.

Apparently you can even pick your trucks now, caliber, buck, or Paris!  This seriously is one of the best ready to ride complete.  

The raptor is way lighter and faster with stock pulleys though, but has 1/3 the range.  I won't get into the 63mm vs 50 mm motor debate cuz that's already been done.

```
So has anyone pre-ordered this?  If someone wanted to buy your raptor would you sell it and get this instead?  Trying to decide...

The raptor is about 6-7 lbs lighter, has big beefy dual 6355 motors (more torque!), and I like the deck...its sleek.  The VESC settings/throttle/brakes came tuned perfectly for me.  Feels nimble under my feet and acceleration is amazing.  It's been working great for me so far and I have no complaints except that the stock wheels are terrible.  

The Ollin is a dual diag set up (never used one), the components are higher quality (ex: original flywheels, ceramic bearings), the deck looks very clean, the battery pack is bigger, and the service/warranty is better.  I'm glad he is using 90 mm flywheels instead of 83 mm.  I don't know what grip tape the board will use or what the stock gearing is...but apparently he has stated that they can change this for you before shipping if needed.  Assuming he will ship in November at the very latest.

Thoughts??  Really on the fence here.

I've pre-ordered. The pre-sale lasts until December so there's still some time.

In addition to liking the specs, the 2 year warranty and aesthetics of the board my rationale for pre-order:

1. His board was truly beta-tested for a year which means his board has a year of refinement and improvements tuned from the tens of thousands of miles his beta-testers put on the board. This is a true version 2 board -- it can be hard being a version 1 customer.
2. U.S. Inventory and Services - As a customer in the U.S. this means reduced repair time and access to replacement parts. A great warranty is much less valuable if a repair takes weeks or months. I think what Enertion has done with their repair infrastructure is commendable, but it's difficult for them to keep inventory in the U.S. so if you're getting your board repaired their techs here their techs still have to wait for parts from Australia. Not to mention that consumable parts that will likely be replaced during the life of the board, like the belt, have to be shipped overseas which takes time. Obviously the consideration is different for customers in other regions and I'm sure Enertion is trying to improve its distribution all the time.
3. Ollin was very responsive and courteous when I emailed him questions.

How was the board beta tested for a year?  He was just asking for beta testers a couple of months ago, I was supposed to be one of the beta testers but I backed out because at that time it was a very early stage and I would have had to pay full price to get the board still.

So he originally released his first hollow-core build in October of 2015. The Flux board. Kudos to him for offering it as a beta test and at a beta test price at that time. I think as time went on he had new versions of the product at varying prices and you may have just been early on as part of a later iteration (this is totally a guess).

It would be a waste to order everything again.

@mishrasubhransu I emailed chaka about the decks a few days ago, here was the response:

>  At this time we are only selling completes but we may start selling the decks alone by the end of the year. They are still the most time consuming part of our build but as we grow and bring in more CNC equipment we will be able to bring them to the market for a fair price.

One more thing I forgot to ask though...any chance of a shorter deck in the future :grin:? Maybe around 33-36 inches?

JUST PRE-ORDERED.  Can't wait,  And for anyone else out there who may be wondering, I will be doing a review just like I did with my raptor and LHB board on this.  Same format, and with the videos to go along with it.  I think I'm done buying boards after this and my hub motor build from LHB.

Edit: Just like @guyguy said chaka is responsive and courteous when I emailed him any questions I had...and he replied fast and answered each question completely.

Ha ha! 😂 I'm glad you finally made a decision! I'm sure there were a couple of side-bets on which way you'd go 😁 and, I quite enjoyed reading your arguments for and against each board. 

To be honest, I would have decided for the Freeride also. I'm sure both the Raptor, and LHB are both fine boards but I feel the @chaka has taken everything to the next level with the Freeride. Both Enertion and LHB are going to have to lift their game otherwise Ollin is going to run away with the market. 

Interesting times!

Enertion has a good board already I think.  If they improve their customer service and quality assurance they can still compete.  The advantage of raptor for me is it is pretty light weight.  It's also very easy to adjust things like the belt tension and motor mount.  My main issue with enertion is just the slow responses and quality control issues.  

LHB stands on his own cuz he offers something different, a custom board.  And he has excellent service as well.  For example you can buy a hub motor board with any hubs of your choice.  I think of him as a DIY builder who is just skilled with putting hardware together in a real clean manner.  I'm going to get another board from him, a super fast 40 mph hub motor build with an 8 ply deck cut to a shape I like with a 12s pack and 97mm flywheels.  

I think with that and my ollin freeride... I'll be done lol.

You're talking about the ollin board?  Well, I'd like to see you a build a DIY with a deck that has compartments to integrate all electronics, get genuine abec 11 flywheels with ceramic bearings, caliber trucks, get a 10s6p pack, and a gt2b tx, and two of the best VESCs on the market, motor mounts, 2 nice motors, grip tape, etc, risers, etc, along with all the tools and machines required to build all that...and see what your cost is.

And not to mention all the time it will take for you to build it...time is money to me.  And some people like me like RIDING more than building.

EDIT: a lightweight carbon deck like the evolve GT?  WHich is also the same price and almost the same weight?

Strong reaction ... not sure why you're offended or calling people that buy complete boards jackasses. No one is making you buy the board, why not innovate and make something better instead of poo-pooing on other's excitement, interest and accomplishment? Believe it or not your tastes and what you spend your money may be different than others as well as your reasons.Believe it or not, those that buy complete boards are supporting the DIY community. You can't sell affordable components without volume, you can't get to volume without attracting more customers, you can't attract more customers without offering completes - a market that is just bigger than the component market - just look at Enertion's growth once they started offering completes.

I completely understand your sentiment and i even sort of agree with it, and there's a lot i would love to say here that i can't, but please tone it down a bit. Your post was flagged but i'm going to let it slide with a warning. Please try to seem less hostile and more helpful in the future. Often that will mean you have to lie to the world about how you really feel. I do that every day in order to maintain a positive atmosphere. Especially here.

I thought DIY was about building your own stuff from rather affordable components
[/quote]

Not even close. I DIY build my own boards because there are no boards on the market that meet my needs (torque that can climb just about any hill with speed, 35 mph+ on slight up hills and flat, and at least a 15 mile range riding in the harshest, hilliest conditions the entire time, which will require a 12s6p or more, and 4wd). My last board cost almost 2k to build in parts without my 1.7k cnc machine or all the other tools I needed (which is probably over 3k in tools alone). People do the DIY route for different reasons. For me, it was about building something way better than what's on the market.

[quote="cantstopme, post:38, topic:7950"]
not buying the most expensive complete boards out there.
[/quote]

Nobody ever said buying chakas board makes someone a DIY builder.

[quote="cantstopme, post:38, topic:7950"]
So tell me what is special about his board?
[/quote]

Um... lets see... Hollow core structure, large enough to fit a 12s6p battery and 2 vescs. Wood core, which looks nicer IMO and has better board feel IMO. It will be the longest range complete ever built, which will have a fair top speed. Have you checked out his tesla style cell level fuses for his battery packs? There's a lot of innovation here, and if you spent less time bashing others work and more time building your board, you would see all the problems chaka has solved with this board.

you are talking out the side of your neck again.  

This board is E P I C.  heavier than some, but the range!  super stealthy and you cannot get this deck anywhere else to build it yourself (smart marketing IMO).  Li Ion batteries in 10s6p!  BMS...  it's all the top of the line built by one of the best.  WITH 2 year warranty...  (that's unprecedented)

I'm seriously looking if i have an extra stash of $ to get one.  And I like building my own...

If it were a small drop deck w/ same features i'd be selling a couple of my own boards to get this!  (hint hint @Chaka)  - like .75-1" drop would be awesome.

So @cantstopme - you have no clue what you are talking about.  _Besides being a troll and stirring shit up, where is a single board you've built?  **Just one.**_  Or maybe even just the plans to build one and share w/ the community?

Bigger batteries aren't just for range, but longevity of the cell itself. A 6P pack leads to lower discharge per cell which equates to less heat and wear on each cell, which, in turn, leads to longer cycle life.

The big ass batteries are all about range as well as cycle life which is also important. You need that range though because no one wants to walk home with a 25 pound board and that's something that is brought up a lot in my conversations with people.  I don't know precisely how much the free ride weighs, but based on my 48 cell packs on dual drive boards with 9ply wooden decks that use slightly bigger motors, i'm guessing its in the vicinity of 24-26 pounds. 48 cell packs weigh about 5 pounds. I imagine a 60 cell pack or even fully loaded with 72 cells is going to be heavy. 

That monster hornet build i just did was 25 pounds. My regular Scarlet builds are about 22.

You clearly have no idea of the challenges of making a hallow core decks. It's not hard to make one. I made my first hollow core deck 7 months ago, and it took 5 hours total, super easy. The problem? Super thick and no concave. Building a hollow core deck which is slightly thicker than the depth needed to fit electronics is hard. Then there's the concave issue (if you don't think you need concave, then you've never irdden a no concave board at 35 mph before). If you think there's no innovation to it, than why isn't everyone doing it? Innovation is doing something different that adds something to that type of product. The only hollow wooden core decks I've seen up and running my latest deck and chaka's (and soon to be @sl33py's, which I'm excited to see).

Even if motors might become more efficient, when will this happen? You can't build a board today on tomorrows technology. Batteries will change in the near future too. We are on the verge of a bunch of break through battery technologies (like lithium air batteries). But we don't know when they will be available (likely years, if ever).

Wheres your board at? What innovations have you offered to the community?

Going back to your original complaint. I want to give you an anecdote. I was riding up west side highway bike path to a meeting and this one gentleman came up to me on a bike when I was waiting on a red light. He started a conversation and proceeded to tell me how an esk8 is sort of a oxymoron because the whole point of skating is kinda like exercise and using an electric motor defeats that purpose. He seems to think I'm doing this for fun and exercise. But the truth is I'm using esk8 as a practical means of commuting in the city. Of course I have fun, but it also makes it possible for me to travel from downtown to Midtown in 20 mins without going through the obstacles of traffic or congested subways. 

What that fella said stuck with me because he was a purist, just like you are, a DIY purist. It doesn't have to be so black and white. I spend thousands on complete boards because I have disposable income and not disposable time. I know it's crazy to think someone wouldn't save $$ when it's cheaper to do DIY, but when I have work 60-80 hours a week, the last thing I want to do is put more work into building a board. 

Besides, my way of contributing to the community is by paying for complete boards from @onloop and @longhairedboy. It helps keeps their business in business and the $$ helps to drive innovation.

So true.  So deep.  So don't know a thing you are talking about.  

Nothing to add - ever.  spouts off as an expert and doesn't know anything esk8 from a hole in the ground...

I recommend you put your "authority behind" something else - maybe something you have a clue about like gardening, or underwater basket weaving.  

There is nothing satus quo about Ollin's board, or the innovative features he's helped the community with.  (his 3d printed 18650 battery holders with individual cell fuses, VESC cooling w/ custom sandwiched aluminum and heatsink, etc.).

Again - how about a build thread of your own.  One where you show your expertise, or simply don't troll other people's threads?

Seriously how many flags before a troll is banned?

I'm sure Chaka's decision about using wood was mostly based on improving the beaver population and supporting the Canadian lumberjack's. Wood is a classic and unparalled material in many sports.

speak your mind - cool.  Critique and suggest better materials - cool.  Knocking anything and everything else folks do here is not being critical and helping them improve - it's being a troll.

I've never seen a single build of your own.  And i actually took the time to look to make sure i'm not just being a dick.

Where is this expertise that you claim to have to "elevate" the status quo? It doesn't exist.  That's cool too.  You don't need to be an expert and suggesting folks use better materials is understandable.  But you didn't come in asking "hey why use wood instead of carbon fiber, or carbon kevlar, or carbon nanotubes..." you just insulted the creator as his work being a "ridiculous piece of wood junk"!  who the hell are you?  Have you ever tried to make a multi-layer board, let alone one cnc'd hollow?  Have you ever made a single esk8.  From DIY components or fully made the brackets and components yourself (one of your other rants and critiques how we aren't DIY buying and assembling our own board)?  No.  You haven't.

This is disrepectful of folks that have taken the time to learn how to do this themselves, and coming from a guy who is a newbie and critiques folks that have hundreds of hours building and innovating is ridiculous.

[quote="cantstopme, post:21, topic:5427, full:true"]
Hello guys, I am new to this board and new to e-boarding in general, but my research on Alibaba also led me to this landwheel drive system. I also had some nice chat with the people involved. I'm yet to buy my first eboard, b/c frankly I'm to clumsy to build one myself and this seems like a good, affordable option. I think they priced it at 350$ (400 with board) last time I asked, which really seems like a competitive price.
[/quote]

What i wish is we got the nice chat version that started, before you started just critiquing other folks work with no basis or knowledge to contribute at all to the community.

I'm done w/ this conversation.  Best of luck building your first air light, flux capacitor powered, hoverboard.

Check reddit and here, carbon GT is a great board but it seems to have having a lot of issues and there remote is really fiddly.  I would still pick the GT if I wanted an AT board.  But since I don't need that, it's quite obvious that ollin is the way to go.  

It would destroy the GT on performance and range.  I prefer the looks, and the remote, so no brainer for me.

Hey Fred.  I have not gotten my board yet so I would assume yours will be after december since mine was supposed to be mid november.  

Regarding the truck set up, usually 50 degrees is standard on normal skateboards.  Generally this means more turning and less stability at higher speeds than say a 45 degree angle.  For downhill they prefer having lower baseplate angles for more stability.  However I believe for e-boards you might usually need a higher degree to give room for components like motor mounts, although since ollin's deck has integrated components that may not matter much.  You also have to keep wheel bite into baseplate angle consideration, but if there are cut outs on the deck then this isn't much of an issue.  

I would not worry about baseplate angle that much, did he ask you for it?  If not leave it at whatever is standard that he ships it with.  To adjust stability for high speeds you can adjust the king pin on your trucks also.  The tighter the trucks the more stable (but less maneuverability).  But I also think tightening the trucks too much is dangerous.  

My best advice would be to tighten them slightly, but keep the trucks loose enough where you are able to make all the turns you need to.  Go only as fast as you feel stable at, keep that as your stop speed.  As you become more comfortable/develop balance you will be able to go at faster speeds without your trucks being tight.

This board will be a beast! 28mph is very fast on a board, but remember you are in full control of how fast you go.  Pad/helmet up, and hope you are able to enjoy safely.

Hi @Ackmaniac, love your app. Just shot you a donation! 

I did select two motors. Using your recommended values in the battery voltage table I think it's way off - it dropped from 36 to 7 miles of range at one point. Still need to do some experimenting of my own to fine tune it. 

I've been sick the last couple of days so I haven't been able to ride much. I've ridden it 23 miles since I charged it and it's hovering around 35-36 volts right now; I am planning on riding it until it hits 33 volts to come up with a better idea of overall range of the board from a full charge.

I was shooting a video with your app earlier this week and accidentally deleted it in the app :cry:
```

The app only calculates the range and battery percentage when no power is drawn. So to have a good reading you should not draw any power for like 3 seconds. Every time you release the throttle the calculation gets adopted to the actual battery voltage. But the battery needs like 3 seconds to get back to its normal no load voltage.
```

Yep - I'm aware of that. It's still giving me strange results and I think it's due to what I input into the battery setup table. I've been using the table you provided here:
 http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/extended-bldc-tool-with-watt-control-mode-ppm-cruise-control-individual-throttle-curve-and-android-app/12286/464

Which I think is for a 12S setup. 

In the battery setup table "number of cells" I take to mean how many series of batteries, not actually how many cells are in the pack. So I put 10 since it's a 10s6p.
```

---
## \#94 Posted by: Ackmaniac Posted at: 2017-02-24T19:00:03.741Z Reads: 216

That's correct. You also need to set the Wh right for your battery. When it is a Samsung 25R then it is 3.6V * 2.5 Ah * 10S * 6P = 540Wh
And when you switch off the board and switch it back on then the Wh drawn and charged values are 0 again. So it starts to calculate the average values again based on your actual consumption. So when you accelerate hard then the values go very high for a short moment until the average normalizes again.

pretty strong voltage sag, guess its because the battery is already fairly low and in the stronger decline regions of the discharge curve, but still didnt expect this kind of drop from chakas large batteries. :hushed:

could also be temperature, but if you just rode your board down to 34V, it might be at a reasonable temperature.

which cells does chaka use?

I don't think it's the temp, before this video I had only ridden less than a mile to this track so the pack wasn't really warmed up. I hadn't charged it after a longer ride earlier that week.

I would say that the cells are already empty. Can you please make a longer video of a normal ride. Because the actual video is not really the way a longboard used normally. Also the used Wh are too low and not realistic.
Also when you wrote that you made already 24 miles with the battery from a full charge then the numbers don't match with the consumption in the video. Because in the video you done already half a mile with very very low usage and then only accelerated 2 times and coasted with a max speed of like 19 miles per hour.
When we say that the battery is empty or nearly empty and you rode 24 miles with it then it is at roughly 13- 14 wh per kilometer (21 - 21.5 wh per mile). Of course this is depended on your own weight and the way you rode the board. But more or less it comes to a normal Wh consumption.
Best would be to have video where you start at a specific point and come back to that point at a decent speed.

Also you lowered the values for the batterys percentage in the app. And i think they are too low. I recommend to have 0% at 3.5V a cell at no load. But it seems you set it to 3.3V. You can still use them at this low voltage but you can only draw 4 amps a cell  before the batterys voltage goes below 2.9V a cell. That of course also explains why you have such a huge voltage sag.

Hey. The point of the video was more for people to hear what the board sounded like which people were asking for on reddit -- not to test the app or show a normal ride. 
 
How long of a ride do you want to see and what are you looking for exactly -- what is your interest here? At what point does the use WH become "realistic"? I would take longer videos but for some reason the app kills my cellphone battery if I leave it on. That and I really don't like holding the phone out when I'm riding in the city. 

On the voltage to  battery % - yes, I know those are all wrong. I was screwing around with some values I saw on a voltage to capacity table online and didn't fix them for this video.

If you record a video during the entire ride then of course it uses more battery from your cellphone. 
It's not that i am after something. I only would like to see my app in action when the board is used normally. 
Because i implemented and calculated a lot of statistics in the app to get rid of some myths. Especially the average amps that are used on the battery and the motor.
For example i made some test about the battery temperature and the Wh consumption on hills at different constant speeds and it is quite interesting. 
Great would be a video of maybe a mile where you ride the board like you would ride it normally and start at a specific location and come back to that location. 
This way you can learn a lot about your board. For example do a run at constant speed and next time the same round with full speed. Next time with a lot of accelerating and braking and so on. This way you get a feeling how your ride style has an impact on your range and consumption.

I recommend these battery settings for the app.

Ok - got it, you asked me to share a video then told me I did it all wrong so just wanted to know what you had in mind specifically :slight_smile:. 

This is all way above my understanding so I'm sure what I'm saying is all half-wrong.  

I used your recommended settings at first but they seemed wrong. Chaka was telling me 4.15 should be where it is approximately at full charge and I also saw this in the app after the charger indicated full charge. The charger can trickle each cell up to 4.2v but he doesn't recommend leaving it on the charger to do that. The initial decline also seemed too shallow. It was dropping to 70% after a very short duration - I waited for voltage to stabilize before taking a reading. The milage remaining was pretty consistent.   

I'll record my morning commute and then my evening commute for science. I'd really like to overlay the data on a gopro video and not have to use the cell to record video. Alternatively I could send you the csv if you're really interested in the data. Let me know if you want anything else - I'd like to support your good works if I can.

I didn't say you did it wrong. I was happy to see a video but i wasn't aware what you wanted to show.

To only charge the cells to 4.15V a cell is absolutely fine. So you get a bit more reacharge cycles out of the cell. And i also don't want to give other recommendations because i think @chaka thought very well about the settings and the advice's he gives to his costumers. So i don't wan't to argue with his advice's.
 
You can get a better video quality by adjusting the video settings in the app. Sadly i have no possibility at the moment to overlay other videos with the data.
You can send me the CSV files but videos would be better if you like to create them. Because then the community can learn from them and compare it with other or their own builds.

And sorry for being so critic. I always hope to see a lot of different videos to compare builds and learn from them.

Right, that and to avoid tripping the BMS on hard braking. He said at 4.2v - merely spinning to full rpm and releasing the throttle can be enough regen to push the cells to 4.25v so its something to avoid.

They're working on them in batches of 10. I think the next wave should be going out soon. 

They're setup over canbus

@ackmaniac I was talking to Chaka over email and he said you can take the pack down to 33v resting safely since the discharge is at a much lower rate. Even momentarily sagging to 2.8v is supposedly ok as 18650 are designed to handle that dip, but it will start building up heat. He also mentioned this information will differ from a lot of people's understandings due to prevailing understanding being based on smaller packs. 

I took a ride to depletion yesterday starting at 35.5v - rode 3.5 miles before the low voltage mode kicked in at 33v. Was able to get another 3 miles after that before hitting 2.8v and the board shutting down. I'm not sure if the vesc's recorded temperature are a good indicator of the pack's heat but it never exceeded 78F and the ambient temperature at the time was ~50F.

In the app you can see when the battery cutoff start kicks in. That is when the battery Box get's yellow. When you have been at 35.5V then i am pretty sure that the VESC reduced the power when you gave a bit more throttle.
But that is absolutely fine. Personally i would even set the battery cutoff start to 3.0V a cell and the cutoff end to 2.8V a cell. This way you are always on the safe side for Li-Ion batterys and have a high power output for a bit longer. And when you feel that the board is reducing the power output drastically then you should stop your ride.

Thx a lot for the video, very good information. 
BTW you can increase the video Quality by using these settings. I think you used the default parameters.

Ugh, the latest update on Instagram was really dissapointing. I was under the impression that there was a lot more progress. Those are only decks #002-006 and they aren't cut or wired yet. They are only mocked up.

I know it sucks @Gizmo, but the really good thing is that anything Ollin related has a great rep with not only product but one of the best customer service reps to go along with their product. I know that doesn't negate the fact that they're behind in production (if that's even the case, I don't know), you're going to get a grade A+ board when you do get it. Hope everything works out.

do you have one on order giz?  if so you can get his # and give him a call - get the best info this way.  It sounds like this batch is pretty dang close (since that instagram post the lids, skins etc are done and the trucks look like they're routed now) - I check the gram every day haha

Ollin motor mount

The only real adjustment that needs to be made is motor mount angle, all of the lateral movement is static and belt tension is set by the tensioner bearing size. The belt doesn't slip or travel laterally (I've found with other 12mm systems there can be lateral movement causing a clicking noise). 

A little loctite between the clamp and the truck keeps the clamp angle in place -  the pictures are of when I cleaned the back motor mount. The front motor mount I cleaned about 200 miles ago, and it's been solid.

I'm curious what you think about the friction-fit motor mount (Requires you to set an angle and use loc-tite?)  Why not mill a keying feature or flat onto one edge of trucks and motor mount to lock it in?  Do you run a different angle depending on the wheels, or is there never a need to adjust that?  And how do you know you have the "right" angle or does it matter within a given area (far as possible from ground but not close enough to hit deck under turn I guess?)
```

Hey Fred, 

I don't think loctite is 100% necessary, but I like to have it anywhere it makes sense as insurance. I like to have the mount as high as possible.  The only thing to look out for when setting the angle is making sure the mount doesn't hit the board on turns, I've found this to be a little more than the thickness of my index finger. You could have it shallow enough for the smallest wheels and just leave them there. I adjust when switching between 83mm and 90mm wheels when the riser is taken out.

There is a set screw in the mount but no flat on the truck. 

When I was messing around with different wheel sizes I hadn't tightened it enough when I first mounted it and dust got in-between the mount and the truck which lead to an inconsistent clamp. Once I cleaned it, it worked great. I know Chaka has made some modifications to the clamp from my feedback so it may be a little different.

I think I'm the 3rd.   2nd probably went to a boosted guy and that's why he doesn't want to post pics haha.

Anyways some tuning to do but so far my impressions are this is unbelievable performance.  Much faster than the metro dual which is 2x 6374.  Might be the battery or FOC I don't know.  

The deck is super light and solid... It's really responsive, which is terrifying at higher speeds lol.  Acceleration is also scary but super smooth.  Brakes seem great considering how loose the belts run.  Rolling resistance is excellent, very low.

Looking at this pic I see one of my motor mounts has rotated down already?  Edit: I can see scratches on the mount.  looks like I bonked it on something (maybe a speed bump).  fixed with a couple taps from a sand hammer

the rear motor looks like its way too close to the road, especially compared to the motor on the other side! seems to be that the angle of the motor mount should be corrected!

If you rode a long distance with the loose mount note that dust/grit can get between the clamp and the truck leading to a bad hold. I had been just adjusting (i.e. sand hammer) and retightening without cleaning it first which led to a bad hold and buildup of dust under the clamp.

I put a little blue loctite when I re clamped and haven't had issues for 100s of miles.

Hey-

I've been looking into the Ollin board (the battery/range/design/looks heavy duty/etc is what caught my attention the most), but I'm having a hard time finding out what has been going on w/ the company since ~February... updates seem to be pretty sparse since then.  Looking at this thread, it looks like maybe the first production run hasn't fully come online.

I've kept an eye on their website for the last couple weeks and it's definitely on my short list of boards, but the board has been listed as 'sold out' the entire time and there doesn't seem to be a lot of information available.  Can anyone speak to the current state of things?  IE: when will they be available for order?  when would new orders receive deliver (approximately)?  are things going smoothly?  how far behind are they? anything else I should know, if I consider purchasing their board?

Thanks!

We are currently finishing the long awaited pre-orders. As we complete new decks they will be listed on our website. You can stay current using our instagram, we usually make a few post when we get a deck close to completion.  Might have one available in month. https://www.instagram.com/ollinboardco/

@nw-esk8 Thanks for your interest in our builds, it really depends on what you mean by widely available? Our main goal is to build as many components for our boards as we can so it is slow going. We are finding ways to increase productivity with the equipment we have but we do need to expand again soon. Never seem to have enough space! 

   Best thing to do if you want one of our builds is to follow us on instagram and email us if you see a deck nearing completion that you want to purchase.

[/quote]

By widely available, I mostly mean being able to purchase one on your website and receive a board within a reasonable and predictable amount of time and when the supply is approaching the demand.  Whether that means entering a queue, etc.  

I don't use instagram that much (not enough to track something well), so being dependent on that + being lucky enough to grab one of the few available boards (assuming others are also waiting, etc) isn't ideal as a 'general' consumer.  

If that's the current reality, that's okay and perfectly fair...it is literally your business :slight_smile: ... but that's mostly what I'm referring to by availability.  Thanks for the follow up, though.
