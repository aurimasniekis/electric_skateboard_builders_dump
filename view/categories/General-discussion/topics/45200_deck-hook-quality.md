I just got my deck hook today but haven't tried it yet. It was mailed to me directly from the factory in Shenzhen China via China ePacket so I'm not sure why it cost so much to ship....anyway, the sewing on the strap is questionable in terms of the weight it has to hold So I just wanted to post this here. I'll be sewing it better because last thing I want is for my board to fall off my 6 feet standing height

Wow that's pretty terrible. I am actually backer nr.1 and I still haven't received it yet but this makes me worried...

As a backer my self Iâ€™m really dissapointed. I saw that someone else posted in the Kickstarter comments saying that it instantly snapped when they put on their Koowheel.

I just received mine today too. 
Mine looks the same quality as @Mikenopolis 
I also tested it out with evolves double kingpin trucks and it does not work. I do recall they said it would work with double kingpin trucks but obviously not evolves chunky trucks. More like gullwing. 

Iâ€™m not too fussed that it doesnâ€™t work with the evolve as the board would be too big to comfortably carry on a backpack but I assume some backers bought it for that reason. 

Yet to test it out with my two commuters which are on caliber 2 trucks. I assume it will be sweet with those trucks. 
Just need to fix the poor stitching first.

I'm pretty sure someone on the forum would be able to make those with a way better quality :grin:

How much did you guys pay for that thing ?

I think it was $25 with $20 shipping BS. I believe they advertised retail would be $50?

$50... :crazy_face: With that crappy sewing, that's nuts.
I'm pretty sure we'll find the same thing on AliExpress in the next month or so, with free or very cheap shipping.

Just got home. It not BS. Is bull diarrhea to the max
If I still have a regular skateboard Iâ€™m sure it would be great. I had wanted to use this for range test to deplete a board while having a 100% board on my back. 

It barely fit the calibers from Enertion nothing else

Also. iOS default writing on picture sucks. I miss my Galaxy Note SPen.

So it seems that the space between the base and the 2 hooks is too small, do you think you'll be able to just bent the 2 hooks a bit so they fit other trucks ?

Man I made one of these for about $5, all parts from Walmart. Consisted of a coat hook that screws into the wall and a few feet of paracord. Iâ€™ll try to get some pictures of it as it was for a friend.

Wow thatâ€™s bad..still tho for an Robards worth a lot of money I couldnâ€™t put it on that and be happy it wouldnâ€™t 1 get robbed as itâ€™s just sitting there and two fall.. I think a dedicated board bag is the best solution like omens bag which Iâ€™m surprised theres no competition for

Posted a video, at 0:26 I showed how it will work with a Boosted board. This is a design flaw, they need to have a larger/longer hook because the plastic locking mechanism is what's getting in the way!

When I get mine I may be able to solve that problem with a 3d printed retainer and replacement straps that wind in between the 3d print. When I get it I will draw it up as it probably dosnt make sense right now

They asked for funding for a product that hasn't even been tested properly... Nice.
Is there a way to tell Kickstarter that this campaign is BS ? To force the company to refund people or send a new copy of the product. I feel bad for you and others that backed up the campaign. This was a good idea but it's been done the wrong way.

Wow damn terible sewing job. On this material, i would sewing a square, with an additional X through. And it looks like, the strips are not flamed, baaad mistake on this strips. And this litle nipples ðŸ˜ž no words, but honestly, no better idea. Maybe not, using this magnets, more these forkclips and sewing this.

They gave out an update on KS mentioning the poor quality of few samples.. I think mine arrived today at the office but I won't know how good they are until Monday.. I think they will replace the faulty items, just email them.

But honestly @Mikenopolis, your sample is terrifying really. It's missing basic QA, not even QA, just at a glance one would see that is horrible. Hope you sort it out!

> We just wanted to let you know that a few of the Deck Hooks have had imperfect stitching on the 2 straps. As this is handmade and itâ€™s a new product, a few units may have this issue but many users have received their deck hook and its working great. Also a couple of customers are having trouble mounting the Deck Hook on to V2 Boosted boards or boards with larger trucks. The arms of the Deck Hook are made of steel and can be bent by hand to fit slightly larger trucks if necessary.

This seems like cheap chinese crap if you look at it.  This hook should be slightly wider to be a true universal hook and they should straps looped around the metal bracket with some over under strap tighteners and it would be fixed.  I'm glad I did not back this item as it looks like there willl be alot of items going back in for replacement

The nipple is attached to the strap by screwing two parts together. I unscrewed the other one and it took less than two turns to take off. With more force I was able to turn it four turns which means the factory was too lazy to make two extra turns. 

Also look at that plastic. It so thin and just another thing to fail down the line even if the strap is fine

Repaired the hook with a new nylon strap. Decided to used this buckle thing so it's adjustable and need no sewing. Used a soldering iron to melt a new hole and screwed in the nipple. Total cost was a little over $2.

Im REALLY insterested in this product, but quality does seem a concern. I contacted the company's support team, they claim to have acknowledged and solved all the QC related issues. Has any of you tried a Hook from the last batch and can testify? Thanks!

It's very likely the company will tell you anything just to get you to send them money.  I would stay away from the Deck Hook like it's a rabid monkey with terrible gas.  It's clear the engineering goal was to obtain money and not make a quality product.

Yup, I imagine that, I still love the concept and want to believe they didn't completely ruin it, that's why I'm asking :/
Not buying it, until I see a V2 or a good clone

You should charge them back for it and tell them they can pay to have it shipped back.  And not support any more crowdfunded ventures

I also received one where one magnet was just barely hanging on to the strap and contacted them and they sent me a replacement which arrived last month and that also seems to be built with questionable quality. Don't think I will even use these and risk my board falling...

I found a dog collar on clearance today. It makes a perfect adjustable strap just cut off the D ring side, use lighter to seal the end, then melt a hole to transplant the clasp nipple thing.

That last image I posted is their final version that holds up much better. But I stand by my thought that an Esk8 is a bit heavy and expensive to drop in case this or your backpack strap donâ€™t hold up to the weight.

My thoughts as well. I think when they advertised it to hold e-skates they didn't account for beastly DIY boards that easily weigh over 20lbs and over. 
Guess I'm back at looking at those Obed bags :disappointed_relieved:

Obed if you have the need to carry an Esk8 often. The way this is designed, I canâ€™t really put something like a laptop in my backpack. The weight of the board would push into whatever is in your bag

Best solution I've used IMO is just mall grabbing the front truck and rolling the board like a suitcase, or having a handle on the board. If you have time to fiddle with a strap because you need to carry your board for an extended time then you probably should just be riding it anyways. Unless ofc your board is dead or busted, but honestly that scenario is so uncommon for me it wouldn't merit purchasing this for the off chance that my board stops working.
