If I haven't put the EXACT KV you want, choose the closest. You can also comment what you are interested in.

So yeah. Let me know. It may be the next KV motor I order.

I think 190 is the sweetspot, it works well for anything from 6s to 12s

Seem like the Vesc loves a 190kv motor

Vesc+10s+190kv=:slight_smile:
This combination is a good balance of performance and durability.
