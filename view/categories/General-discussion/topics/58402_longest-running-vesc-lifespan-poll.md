Interesting thread, additionally it would be good to know how often the vesc was in use because it can be a huge difference in lifespan between daily use and seldom use. And there are countries where you can ride the whole year and countries where it's just a couple of months.

But 3 years sounds great anyway :grin:

It is used at least once or twice a week by me, and my brother uses it as well.
And I can ride all year long if it's not raining ( sometimes it rains for consecutive weeks tho)

Time means not so much to me.

The two focbox in my Evo have about 6000 miles in them.(4k+ are from the vanguard they were in before the Evo)

Comparatively I have had ESCs that last less then a mile, less then 30 miles, and also die at 300 miles. 

I think certain ESCs were designed for abuse... And also think milage is a better tell tale sign then time..

Yeah you are right!
But over 3 years it was hard for me to guess the mileage
