Hi I'm new here , and I have a question . I'm having a Maytech VESC I control with a servo tester (which t
It has modified a hall sensor, a thumb throttle , when I push the throttle it stops and when I release it it accelerates , does anybody have any idea how to overturn it ? In the BLDC TOOL I didn't find anything that can help . Thanks

Turn everything off and swap any two of the three motor wires would be my first move. That's how I reverse the direction for my esk8's. if you are running sensored foc or hybrid then I would wait for a more experienced user to answer. There may be more to it than I know.

Good luck.

Did you run motor detection and set you min and max pulse width values?

I have the min pulse to 1.25 and max about 1.50 , but when I press the throttle is 1.25 and when I release it is 1.50  and I don't see any option that inverts that :confused:

It's not the motor direction it's the throttle that works inverted .

ok so i had this issue as well.. i fixed it by ppm calibration

too be more specific watch the display when you hold the throttle down.. record that value and then make it your min.. i beleive this is how i fixed it

do you have winning remote?

Could your potentiometer you use as throttle be wired upside down?

I thought this as well when I first got my remotes,so I tested another one. it seems all my winning remotes, do this right out of the bag.

Sorry I don't know that remote.  Is it maybe possible it has a invert switch like some remotes have for the direction wheel.

well that does not do anything at all , no I don't have a remote , I have a thumb trottle connected (bypass) in a servo tester <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/9/f/9f6e941ed7ad57c1eb0d913a5ea95e03de149935.jpg" width="375" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/2/a/2a2e7956f51cbe0ef11dce6de2244ea7a62fc471.jpg" width="375" height="500">

Well I'm new here üòõI don't know anyone  I'm trying to put it in reverse and change the motor wires but it does not go reverse at all and I don't know why

Btw I have an alien power systems 6374 60kv that says max 10s I l ask  them and they told me it can handle 12s  but they have not   tested it , any idea ?

if you can see input in bloc ppm window, then it might just be programming.. ya motor/battery rating is fine I believe...always seek a second or third opinion =)

It will take a lot of stress and I'm trying to find a way to have it cool and I think 12s is better than 10s , I'm also thinking to change from BLDC mode to FOC but many guys say it might destroy the VESC

You may need to get a different servo tester. I had the same problem a couple of years ago.

Yes I did that but the throttle works inverted more pulse when free less pulse when pushed

If it helps, I had to use a servo tester that had the pot dial on it.

I did it differently by soldering the signal wire to the middle pin on the pot if I remember right. Then I adjusted the pot to zero out the signal between forward and reverse.
