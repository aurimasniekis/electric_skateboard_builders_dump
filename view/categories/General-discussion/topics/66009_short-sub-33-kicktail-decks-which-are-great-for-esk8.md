I'm looking to do a hub motor short board deck, focus on light weight and portability.
got serious kicktail envy, for tick-tacs and for easy grabbing off the ground
what decks should i look into?

needs to be **sub 33" total length** and **19"+ wheelbase** (enough room to comfortably fit stuff)
flat, wide bottom surfaces are good, makes for easy enclosures
stiff decks also great, don't have to worry about enclosure flex

**the aileron 121C** in particular looks super interesting, you can get it in a VERY stiff configuration, it looks cool, and it's very flat on the bottom which would make for easy enclosures. also quite light. Downside is drilling through carbon fiber for an enclosure really sucks. fits right in the target range with a 31" length and 19" wheelbase though

I have Wowgo hubs on a 121c Aileron deck... I must say it vibrates and resonates pretty bad compared to wood.  Pretty nimble and light.

Gonna change over to Skullboard hubs and wheels to see if this alleviates some of the vibration.

i was about to say "why not just use rubber risers to dampen vibration" but it looks like you already have those, unless those are solid risers?

a lot of those look nice but, isn't the wheelbase pretty short?
tried looking up wheelbase on the decathlon and the ikea but couldn't find any numbers
although i guess if you have a stacked battery, even down to 16" wheelbase isn't too bad. or is it?


Truncated Tesseract looks nice, but it has essentially no kicktail, and is $206 for just the deck, whew
https://loadedboards.com/truncated-tesseract-longboard-skateboard/
33" long, 24.5 to 26" wheelbase

the bustin looks really great, actually, love the wheel arches and the super pronounced kicktail, but 16.5" wheelbase is really, really tight. 
could possibly make that work by doing a 10s3p stacked and having the enclosure be somewhat tall, making up for it with risers on trucks

just 3D printed and reinforced with a sheet of carbon fiber.

the bustin is really cool for wheelings

and the enclosure handled the tricks quite well

It is a shame that Muirskate and Earthwing don't seem to be making the Muirderer 33" any more. It also had deep wheel flares, kicktail and had a 19in wheelbase. Not to mention it was a bargain.![IMG_2677|690x301](upload://xTDFO95FcxgbQGaAfDNedQKM9Ny.JPG)
Those are 70mm wheels BTW

If you are entertaining suggestions down at 16 inches?
Might as well go all the way, you can get a new release "old school" pool deck @15.4 inches...

Sub 16 inches basically you go shopping for popsicles/park decks...

Patrick Switzer's Rayne Misfortune. It's not sub 33 but 33, super long wheelbase and if the rear truck mounted in most forward position the kicktail is usable.
I am building a mall grabber with that one at the moment, only the concave is hard to make a enclosure for it.

Customskateboards.com has a lot of super inexpensive boards with every design/shape you can think of. Their big boards are $25 and the small ones are $17. But you have to add your own paint/finish and grip tape on most of them. 
https://www.customskateboards.com/Blank-Old-School These ones are all around 30" long but only have 15" wheelbases
I'm planning on getting this one sometime in the next week or so https://www.customskateboards.com/Blank-Old-School/Blank-Lip-Slide-Old-School

I am in the process of using a bustin 2013 spliff and make a dual built drive.   The plan is to use small cheap racerstar 5045 motors 200kv,  and cheap eBay esc and some lipo 4000mah in 10s.  83mm wheels 36/15 gears 15mm belts.  Diy motor mounts on 10inch trucks.    The goal is to made the skateboard portable, use for flat ground and 4 to 5 miles distance ![hd_product_Bustin_Spliff_Liberty_Natural__Set_|500x500](upload://t4xsMwpbhO082rBklffX8Vy8dHb.jpg)

I too am in the same position. My favourite board so far is a Landyachtz Ripple Ridge. I really like landyachtz as they have nice graphics, relatively easy to get in my country (Singapore) and pretty firm maple which is good for eskate. 

1. Landyachtz Ripple Ridge
Very nice ripple shape which lets your feet really grab the board and feel locked in. Long enough but not too long.

2. Landyachtz 36 Peacemaker
Long variant with nice kicktail shape

3. Landyachtz Dinghy 28"
Ultra light and short. If you want a really compact deck, they have a mini dinghy which is like a Penny Nickel size.

4. Landyachtz Tugboat
Larger size suitable for longboard trucks, but similar length to dinghy.
Got to google this yourself as forums dont let me add more pics.

I would also consider Rayne Bright/Darkside.
