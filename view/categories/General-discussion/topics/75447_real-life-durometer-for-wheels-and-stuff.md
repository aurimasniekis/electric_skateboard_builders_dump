Must be cold over there.
Who would have thought yellow nipples are harder than purple ones.

This could become a very cool chat up thing, interested minds would like to know how the cat responded.

When you rest the base of the meter on the surface you want to measure. It measures how far the pin at the middle extend/ pressure on the pin since the pin is slightly longer.

I don't think measuring duro only is a true indicator of a high quality wheel. You also have rebound which is a bit harder to measure and the thane formula which is also harder to measure. Nice though. Very well needed info :)

FYI, You need to include temperature when giving "real life" durometer readings on urethane.

Try measuring the durometer of a wheel before a ride, and then again after its been ridden for 5 min.
