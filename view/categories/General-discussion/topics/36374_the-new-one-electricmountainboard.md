Remember it's only a Trampa Deck and actually the axis! 
The rest is from ESK8 
When you buy a Trampa electric Board for 1700€ you only get a board with toothbelt that to tear every time ! No Akku cells and no Vescbox and no Akkubox !

In the next posts I tell you wich axis I change for the Trampa axis
