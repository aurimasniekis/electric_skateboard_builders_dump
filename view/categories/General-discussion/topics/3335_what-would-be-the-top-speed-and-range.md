Welcome


Have at it

Plug in your numbers ... Use 70-75 efficiency 

Range IS dependent on many factors which I will not name because you can guess what they are ....

The guys with a space cell will hopefully chime in and give you a real world range

Welcome to the best e-board forum on the planet!
Unless your weight is around 50 lbs. 
your gonna want a dual motor setup to climb 35% grades with those big wheels. 
I'm running dual 6355 230 KV, 2650 watt ea. with 12s and have climbed abt a 20% grade with 90mm wheels and felt like the setup handled it but with a generous amount of throttle.
