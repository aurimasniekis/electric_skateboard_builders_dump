Trampa decks for urban stuff. they have less flex, limited enclosure options, no concave (Personally the killer for me), limited truck options (No surfrodz? unless you can. From what i've seen, the holes won't line up unless you drill your own) and they are very expensive. From personal use, I've always preferred a landy evo, switchblade or  other options with nice concave or a vanguard for flex and comfort. 

Why do people buy gummies? Don't they effectively make your wheels much harder, because its a thin layer of PU, like a hub motor? Wouldn't 6" tires or 107mm flywheels make for the better of what you're getting with the gummies, that being range or comfort? Just not sure why they'd be worth over 200$ for a set. 

I don't mean to bash anyone who has these, they are certainly nice products, I personally just don't see the value in them compared to other options and was wondering why they were so widely used (especially trampa decks)

The main selling point of the trampa deck is the cool look and flex. As for the gummies they are 125mm so they don’t need as much urethane to feel comfortable. 

This is just how I see it, I don’t actually have either of these as they are well above my price range

There are enough enclosure options and the decks have more than enough flex depending on the ply you choose.

Someone described riding on urethane...like wearing cement shoes.

Once you get over the initial look of AT compared to hot wheels look thane

There's no going back for me six shooters...some flex deck...Surf Rodz...sound familiar..lol

i don´t see so much builds with an urban carve and gummies.
I think way much more are made out of HS11/holy pro decks and pneumatic wheels.
most people who want to carve will not go for a trampa.
if you have rough roads and consider to swap between gummies and pneumatics it´s more an option...
but as everything in live it´s just personal preference....
there people who like how it looks or like the fact that it will never break (unless you are @rich) ... and other even don´t want to open therer side...

Please see this my friend: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjdPcxgTrJk&t=1s

You'll see both TRAMPA decks, cambered (CARVER) and straight (ORRSUM) at 1:52 

![29%20AM|690x318](upload://xX2V9e3nhM0qPhS1mxMKWarrXQI.jpeg) 

The ORRSUM features an entirely new deck _and_ the 10FIFTY production CNC precision truck designed for the purpose of urban ESK8 on pneumatics - 10FIFTYs are 10.5", solid CNC trucks.

In regards to Gummies, we all immediately recognize "hub motor board feel" when we see it. Thin urethane around a wheel is not that different from thin urethane around a hub, right.  We know more core = less feel.

Gummies are an option for TRAMPA pneumatic customers to try urethane but still maintain their relative ride height on concrete.  I bought some from Francisco, they're OK.

I'll order an Orrsum so we can have one on the map in California.

Can't stand the mountainboard Trampa deck either. Such a weird posture and not much flex. Gummies are way overpriced, hell they would cost me approx $390 AUD not even shipped. And then, they slip and deform at high speeds and acceleration. No thanks. Better off with some Abec 107s or Boa Constrictors.

Exactly my opinion.
I still don't know why people get the decks but this explanation of gummies I guess made me see why people TRY them "Gummies are an option for TRAMPA pneumatic customers to try urethane but still maintain their relative ride height on concrete."

Gummies are sexy. 

If you had not experienced, then I see why it might be hard to understand. That’s okay! 

Like ever business, as the esk8 industry matures, the best products will stand out and prices will drop as more competitors enter the market. Maybe in 2040, gummies will be less expensive.

I’m really like the feel of my trampa mountainboard deck. I had a carver and I chose a deck that was too stiff, it ended up being uncomfortable as I had the ‘cowboy’ stance thing as a result of the too high ply count. With my current deck I’ve got it perfect and the deck is flat when I’m on it, very comfortable for many miles. But yeah, personal preference and use case.

Yea i love the fact you can get custom rims and gummies, black rims red spokes and gummies looks sweet af. I think trampa decks are ugly though (kaly logo in the middle actually looks really nice though) so I wouldn't get all trampa for looks. The best looking board I have ever seen was a landy evo falcon with black wheels and red wires, the curves on that deck are just so aggressive its like the lambo of esk8

The evo falcon is legit.

Trampa mountain/kite boards maybe ugly to some but they meant to get abused. Battery under trampa is custom for street and some low level all terrain. Battery on top is where you can abuse.

If you think trampa mountain board is not sexy then look to MBS mountain board. I have seen fewer electric MBS mountainboard than trampa. In another post, they said it was first mover advantage. It depends what you want to do, then find best tools.

If you want to look sexy but lose some of the urethane, gummies did that for me.

I hope to see more mountainboard decks come out. Especially right next to me so I don’t need to ship it.😂

For some it seems to be too much flex....
https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/eu-trampa-short-deck-for-sale-or-trade-13-ply-lowered-price/66486?u=andy87

Just depends how much ply you bought and how heavy you are. For sure with 60kg and a 17ply you will not have a flex at all.

There is really no explanation for this but it's all personal preference. People are weird in their own weird ways. 

As for the trampa deck and it's flex, if it doesn't flex for you then you have a deck that's too thick, or if you tried someone else's trampa and didn't like it, it's probably because they didn't build it for you and they built it just the way they like it. And this goes for all the decks and wheels.
That's the beauty of DIY, you can do it the way you like it. Trying to understand why other people do things a certain way or like certain things is..... Well, keep trying. I won't.

I get what you're saying but the answer is still the same. Some people are loyal to Trampa, some people are introduced to esk8 through a YouTube video featuring a carver, some people just like the unique look of gummies.

It's all just personal preference in the end. If we were all riding around on the same boards we'd dEvovle.

Thanks a lot for your comments @Linny @tenshi0 @ethel @deucesdown  :smiling_face_with_three_hearts:
I wasn't sure if this video is too ridiculous so glad you like it :laughing:

It's a 14ply Carver deck and I'm 74kg so it's quite flexy. While riding I don't use it as trampoline.

For a strictly street build I probably would choose a longboard because of weight but I wanted a hybrid build where I can mount whatever wheels I want. And the Gummies roll over almost everything. Is this stuff expensive? YES Can I afford it? NOT REALLY Why I buy it? ADDICTION. It's like a virus or drug. If you already have a urban carver with 7" wheels it's hard to resist not to buy Gummies. And personally I like the look

Same as above.

This is genuine curiosity, I have no blind loyalty to Trampa- I just ride them on my carvers because I don't have that many options and I dislike how MBS Matrix feel. I can say that I've never even seen the notion of a speed wobble even at around 40-42mph, and that's been as fast as my configurations/confidence have taken me so far. Is this based on experience from people who know how to tune/dampen in a channel spring truck?

I'd love to hear more information on this as it would be useful to know regardless of my personal experiences so far.

Ok granted I have had very limited experience with street carvers.  Spent a week on my bros kaly/trampa
last year and compared to my set up at the time I found it unstable.  Same with a guy on a group ride who wanted to try my evo.  Loved the carve but did not feel comfortable at speed.  This is obviously something you could get used to I'm sure but after those experiences and then when the info starts to filter down through the forum of similar tales it can fix your mindset which I know is not very scientific.  Average joe in the street who is used to traditional set ups will struggle on a channel truck to start with.  I think thats where it comes from.  One thing though is true and no one can really argue, they are not great speed set ups.  They are not designed for it.

And given our riding weight difference I would totally expect this. They also are just a completely different style of board in how they ride, I ride longboards & mountainboards/carvers.

Why can't it be argued? 

My curiosity here is to see if anyone has hard experience/logic behind why it would be considered unstable over RKPs at higher speeds. Evidence, not subjective opinion. 

I also have seen a lot of 'Youtube carvers' running without dampeners at all.

I don't have a radar, but this really isn't even unheard of downhill. I'm in the process of rebuilding my carver as we speak, but I'd be happy to share my ride logs. 34-38mph is commonplace among the riders I talk to. 

Again, I'm not saying they are built for speed. Just that the claim that they faceplant you at 25+ is outright incorrect based on my daily riding experience. 

I'm looking for more than 2nd or 3rd hand accounts out of legitimate curiosity to learn more.

Just to elaborate my distain for channel trucks a bit more. Please don’t take it personally, they are great for anything but going fast. Derek was the guy speed testing channels. I’d like to leave it there for where I derive my bias from.
[/quote]


Feel free to elaborate.

I promise I don't take anything personally on here, I'm just in pursuit of information on this since what's being stated contradicts my personal experience.

I'm curious if the reports of instability come from inexperience on channel trucks, and if not I'd love to hear someone chime in with factual data to support it.

Here is a guy who could do it all. Meticulous and Methodical in his approach, driven. I still would put his builds in the world top 5. He spent countless hours and had endless problems trying to make channels work. I think he would have written them off earlier if it wasn't for the fantastic drive system. I wish he would have.

Given that I don't know the situation or the person at all, what am I to read into this? If this was your friend, my condolences for your loss. 

I'm not trying to be dense here, I'm just searching for data rather than anecdotal testimony. Is the implication being made that channel trucks are so unstable at high speeds that they are deadly to even attempt? 

I'm also not talking about attempting 50+mph on these. I'm not a racer, I build my boards for entirely different reasons and I don't really need an everyday configuration that goes faster than 35mph. 

This inquiry all started from the claim that channel trucks can't do 25+ safely, which simply is not true. I'm not trying to say they are built for high speeds (45mph+)

My curiosity here is to see if anyone has hard experience/logic behind why it would be considered unstable over RKPs at higher speeds. Evidence, not subjective opinion.
[/quote]

To be clear I'm not talking about numies and full mountainboard specs.  I'm talking urethane on the trampa deck and trucks and my opinion is based on actual riding experience.  My actual riding experience.  Thats all.  Given time I'm sure that I could have coaxed the thing up there but I personally wasn't up to the task in the time I had but give me a full rkp downhill set up and in 10 minutes I will have it hitting 40+ if its capable.  Its a completely moot point though because I'd rather chew off one of my arms than ride one again with urethane.  Not my cup of tea so to speak.

 If your looking for technical "data" on truck dynamic stability there just isn't much to be had.   An engineered piece still has to be tested to be proven. A stable truck at 45mph will be more predictible at 25 but will not be as carvy as one would like at 15mph. It's all about dialing in for what your trying to accomplish.  Anecdotal testimony here with truck setup is about all you have to sort through.  Sorry about your truck choice. Current Channel trucks are no bueno for speed.

You might want to rethink your opinion on channel trucks. @DerelictRobot tuned his setup really well. It changed my mind on how stable they can be. To be honest you probably don't have enough first hand experience with anything other than your handmade trucks so your opinion might be less than helpful and purely anecdotal here.

I dont think you took into account that the TRAMPA boards are purpose built. They are designed to be jumped, trashed, carved, and abused 100x more than a E-Board. With this design methodology their boards focus around the MTB toughness.

The gummies are comparative to aftermarket car wheels. Obviously there are specific benefits like weight, traction, increase in diameter/speed, but they cater to people who like to modify their vehicles for show, performance, or for fun.

There are skateboards, longboards, and mountainboards. Trampa trucks wheels and decks are the best mountainboards, even if the terrain is the big city. By focusing on this rugged design they are ready for next level eskating. A recent 20 mile plus ride around San Francisco was an interesting time to watch the Trampa boards chew up the city.

@MoeStooge Derek's death was very tragic but you are out of line using his death in an attempt to prove your stance on channel trucks. If you want to talk about why we should wear helmets I could understand why you would reference the death of a friend who died because he was not wearing a helmet, but to blame channel trucks for his death is not cool.

It is OK to be wrong about your assumptions on channel trucks. I too thought they were unstable at higher speeds but it turns out they can be tuned just like other truck designs.

With channel trucks tuning can sometimes start with deck choice. Most MTB decks have something like a 30 deg front and 30 deg rear mounting angle but some are available with a 20 deg rear angle for better stability and tracking. From there you can add wedges to make more adjustments. Adding urethane dampers or switching out for stiffer bushings is the other end of the equation. 

More importantly you need to keep your weight forward and get low when going fast. However, a dual rear can get really sketchy no matter how good your setup. In a bad situation it can swing sideways and toss you in an instant. On pneumatics this may not be as big an issue as it is on skate wheels but still something to think about.

It depends how much rake you have in the trucks. Most racers like a bit more rake up front and less in the rear.

Unless you are the pit crew for this vagabond you should be speaking in terms of rake not caster.

But that is not the case, all one has to do to see you are wrong is flip their board over and push the trucks side to side. The axle center, if the truck has positive rake, is ahead of the pivot center.

The king pin is deffinitly along the axial plane of the pivot but it is not the pivot center.

Rake determines if the axle is forward or behind the pivot center. More importantly, it determines if the axle is above or below the pivot center.

For instance @MoeStooge truck system is zero rake.

This is really what started my inquiry. A claim was made, connected to a specific speed even, that in my personal experience is incorrect. 

I'm not a MechE, I don't have much experience in vehicle dynamics. So the difference in opinion on this is fascinating to me and I'm just trying my best to keep up here. I appreciate the effort put in here, and I'm simply curious to better understand the differences

'High speed' is going to be relative to everyone unless we quantify it. My own experience as well as numerous other riders shows that channel truck configurations are easily stable up to 35-40mph. I cannot speak to anything beyond that, but I can say that when I reached my own top speed I backed off more to my lack of massive gonads than from concerns over stability. 

I would love to explore what the real world limitations/ceiling of these are. I've seen radial steering stabilizers added to the rear trucks on 3 different carver builds at this point, which is exactly the type of modifications I would expect on a racing build. 

They may not be best suited for high speed on-road racing, but they're also better suited for off-road and there's still merit in exploring what the upper limits are, yeah? 

I just see a lot of: "doesn't work well for high speed"

I understand the points made about caster angle in the other thread, but obviously there are other mechanical differences between these boards than that. 

I guess we have to define high speed then. Because 30-40 is already done on most common builds that run dampeners.

@Kaly would you like to weigh in on your experience? You've probably put more Esk8 miles on channel trucks than almost anyone at this point.

Of course it is always difficult to "eat crow" but the whole strawman argument and then the fact that someone blamed channel trucks for the death of a friend was a little surprising for everyone. I think everyone here knows skateboarding is inherently dangerous, we do not need senior members blaming manufacturers for an accident that could have been avoided had the rider been wearing appropriate safety equipment.

Fact remains that I would feel more comfortable on rkp's on street but your results have me excited for an upcoming offroad build I have in my shop.

Still can't believe how far this thing has gone.  Interesting info and well worth the read.
I will say though.  If rkp and tkp trucks did not exist then we would all be screaming round on channels at 45+mph.  We would have got used to it and would know how.
When you spend 30 years riding traditional trucks, channels are a learning curve.  Different style of riding which I'm sure is the only reason why there is such a passionate argument happening here.
So much muscle memory that we forget how hard it actually is to ride anything at 45+mph

I stand with you on this matter. 

In my experience the channel are pretty stable if the system is properly configure, this trucks are different and ride a bit higher that other trucks. 

The stability issues are not due to the truck shape or kingpin position, mostly is a combination of factors that contribute to this, specially this 3 : 

1- Rider:
The more experienced a rider is on regular trucks the more subconscious habits his body has and at higher speed this tendencies are what control your behavior. So before gunning it on channel truck  try to practice, practice. 

2 - Suspension: 
The spring damper combination is it  crucial since here is where any starting vibrations will get amplify or neutralize, personally I use softer springs and softer vertically hollowed damper for a stable ride at high speed and proper turning at low speed. 

3 - Bearing seat and axles tolerances:
This is where the 90% of the bulk of issues and bad Rep for the channel truck originates. 

The channel truck is most widely use on big pneumatic tires with a radius ranging from 3.25 inches to 4inches this wheels are unbalanced from factory, add to this the following bearing and axle issues:
* Too big of a gap between axle and inside diameter of the bearing. 
* Inside the ball bearings tracks with too much play. 
* Too big of a gap between Hub and the bearing outside diameter. 
All this contributes to a crazy vibration at the center and the pneumatic wheel will amplify the vibration that  then will travel to the springs causing this to fall into a chaotic vibrating state. 

At the end it does not matter which truck you are using if your wheels are wobbling too much.

@Deckoz  Try not to immediately discount our understanding.

You are probably my single most bookmarked poster on these forums, so please don't think that I discount what you're saying. We're all trying to learn here. 

I can comfortably break 35+ on my current channel truck setup, without any concerns of stability. I'm not saying the same setup can go 50+. I don't even want to go that fast. I'm just curious what it would take to do so.

We still haven't even defined what 'high speed' is.

@deckoz here is a pretty picture to help you understand where the pivot axis is in relation to the truck axle. And in case you are wondering almost everyone with a decent setup is going to have some positive rake on the front and rear of their board. You would need a neg rake to have any of the caster effect you seem to think is taking place.

I'm a heavy guy with a 17 Ply trampa, top speed of board is 30 mph. Had one serious crash due to wobble when going down hill. The road was concave/gravel. After the crash noticed general instability with bumbs and finally figured out the riding characteristics changed drastically compared to when I first used the board. Needed to tighten the springs (and thus dampers) 5 turns to get the original stiffness. Lesson learned, stuff softens up. 

Other than things softening up, the deck indeed acts like a loaded spring if you ride it incorrectly. More like snowboarding after fresh snow with tons of little hills, gotto  ride low & absorb all bumps with your legs or it will start bouncing / you loose control.

Wheel size will greatly affect castor. The larger your wheels, the greater the effective axle offset. Because any side loads aren't at the wheel center, but are instead at when wheel edge.

While I agree that castor effects the ride control, I don't think that a SINGLE esk8 has negative castor right now.


The contact patch of the wheel should line up with the pivot axis (0 castor), or it should be behind the pivot axis (negative castor). This allows the truck to move purely from rider input. It will not move at all from side loads like carving hard.

Our standard trucks will try to continue turning when the rider attempts to turn due to the sideways friction of the wheels. It requires the rider to "fight" the turn, or at least put in minimal effort into turning while in high speed. That fighting is what causes speed wobbles, hence instability.

With a 0 castor or positive castor truck you'd have no additional forces adding to the turn, or even forces fighting your turn. Which for high speed would help significantly.

Go ahead and try it, hold your board and push sideways on the contact patch. It's gonna turn the truck in the direction that would cause additional sideways friction from a harder carve.

All of the above is just a personal anecdote, but I'm going to have to agree with @Deckoz here. 

EDIT: I just found the design for channel trucks. I can see exactly why these would be inherently unstable. You definitely need dampening for oscillations as side loads will simply cause constructive interference.

Not sure if you are special or just don't like being wrong, I like to think it is the latter. It does not really matter where the king pin is along the pivot axis. The only real difference is the amount of rake on channel trucks. You continue to misunderstand how trucks function and seem to think a caster effect is desirable. To be honest a lot of us are really surprised by your comments.

And again you are confusing truck walk with caster effect.

Every pro racer I know rides an inherently unstable setup. You want that in a racing setup. The key is to have the rear track the front but you still want positive rake.

Last thing you want is zero rake in a racing board.

I can't understand the definition of caster angle as far as skate trucks go.
However since the axle on most channel trucks is assymetric, wouldn't fliping the hanger reduce the leading effect ? Along with changing the roll center and rake.

Hi @MoeStooge
That will be nice, racing uphill, sure I will have to work the logistics. 

On the topic of trucks here we are comparing different system, each one has its pro and cons also overlapping functionality where both shine. 

When it comes to stability this is a relative term because it greatly depends on the terrain, a F1 car shines on tarmac and a baja truck shines on the trail. 

I’ve started using the truck channel because the terrain where I ride is a mix one, good pavement, shitty pavement, big cracks, potholes, park trails and dirt trails so had to go with the best equipment for my application, if the conditions were different then RKP will be. Don’t get me wrong on my push board i have 200 mm RKP  Surfrods and love it. 

@Deckoz 
The effect you are discussing does not translate equally to channel trucks since the constraints conditions are different, on a regular truck the pivot and suspension are all on the same point where on the channel truck the suspension and pivot  are at different positions, so the mechanical effect is a bit different.

Your stipulation is based on the assumption that the weight distribution is equally on both the front and rear truck, that isn’t always true, the front truck does have more weight on it and the front foot does initiate the turn. I just saying power on the rear truck is a viable option, the bushing is tighter and is less likely to torque steer, because it is less responsive.

A channel truck is essentially a zero degree ronin or liquid truck

I do my speed test runs around 1AM from 23rd street and 1st ave all the way to the Willis ave. Bridge in New York, that is around 6 miles on a real road, that includes pavement waves, cracks, expansion joints, pot holes and who know what else. I keep a speed from 35 to 40 mph around 90% of the time.

While I love your most recent video, I'm gonna have to disagree regarding wheel size. You're correct that castor would normally be unaffected by wheel size, however this is not a normal application. Since our trucks pivot at an angle the castor pivot is also affected, thus a vertical offset to wheel contact affects a horizontal offset regarding castor.

It's quite possible that I'm misappropriating the name castor for an entirely different dynamic, but whatever it is I'm talking about I still stand by.

Also, the comparison of a board with no bushings was great. I'd seen a video before of that action and it was quite interesting.

And if you change wheel size, the larger you go the higher the frequency of the oscillations will occur for the same given truck design.

so i have watched your video twice and i had not considered the "push" of the rear truck from behind, which could cause wobble on a conventional skate truck. My current thinking is that regular skate trucks may "walk" on the "trialling" truck due to the play in the rubber bushing. This means that the axle is not fully constrained in all directions and has some amount of lateral play that allows it to shift slightly from its centre alignment.

The point im getting to is that this not sure that this is still true for a channel truck. In theory the rigid kingpin(is the the right term) and 2 points of contact means that the axle is fully constrained to only rotate about 1 axis, its not free to wiggle laterally in the same way that a normal skate truck is able to.
In this rigid configuration i cant see how its possible for either truck to "walk" as its not physically possible for the axle to deviate from its center-line.

In terms of a new Channel truck, this is somewhat correct. It'll only be new and un- ovalized until it's first proper ride. Or until it hits something it doesn't like. It's just a bad design. They've been ovalizing kingpin holes for 20+ years. With traditional trucks TKP or RKP this isn't an issue.

@Deckoz i'm trying to understand this rear vs front, trailing front and leading rear. 

If I understand you correctly, you are saying that a trailing rear RKP with trailing front RKP would make for the most stable setup? 

If this is correct, i've made a quick mockup of what this rear trailing RKP might look like... with negative rake to boot: 

![PNG|662x500](upload://gotwNgzFpJQDrIlFci6oQmyYNFZ.jpeg) ![PNG|556x500](upload://2EWbG9DV0mODEVRiz7WH85qyDoM.jpeg) ![two|643x500](upload://3L53HkgwWNSbyADYuC3SGw1rJCi.png) 

Is this sort-of the right train of thought?

Question now: Is this almost just like a TKP with squared off turning geometry?

I'm a little confused here. If this is the rear truck, wouldn't you want a "normal" rkp truck so that the castor effect is kept in check by the forward pull of the driven wheels?

Or maybe all these dynamics are getting jumbled up in my head.

 What you get on a single or dual diagonal without a precision truck. Not to be confused with torque steer.

Kaly.NYC hangers. Unf.

Thank you very much for taking the time to make this video and talk through your understanding on these.

And again, this is exactly what I'm asking for. Real world experience on these rather than pure conjecture.

How many people on this forum, much less in this conversation, have built a channel truck board and put even 1000 miles on it? I think a lot of this is speculation about theoretical disadvantages that simply don't show up at the speeds most people are riding at. If this instability only shows up at 50+mph, it's unfair to call them intrinsically unstable as that's a fringe case where the goalposts have been moved to support the claim.
