Alrighty bitches....Contest time

Only open to people that did not go the Esk8Squad Renegade Vegas Weekend October 19-21, 2018

Contest ends November 11, 2018 at 9pm Vegas time

This is a global Contest 

Most ‚ù§Ô∏è On thier post Wins

Below, explain why you missed the Renegade Weekend. Pictures allowed.

What was soooooo important that you couldn‚Äôt just drop everything and shirk all adult responsibility like the rest of us?....We left our kids with grandparents, we put extra food in the bowls of all our animals, they hauled all their gear to Vegas....... so on and so fourth......WTF was so important?
![image|500x500](upload://op7YjvIaWCE5iqgNahDnG639dbU.jpeg) 
The winner gets some @LazyRolling bearings & Skatetool all the way from Sweden.....and that‚Äôs not all I‚Äôll throw in a Esk8Squad and Esk8OrDie vinyl helmet stickers as well

For the least ‚ù§Ô∏è I‚Äôll mail you some random stickers 

Good luck!

I got my dick stuck in the motors of an imaginary airplane I was building to transport myself to Vegas from the other side of the world.  

5 day hospitalization.

My excuse is pretty lame, I just picked buying more parts over having a vacation.
Plus my wife gave me the "yeah sure, you can totally go" but I knew it really meant "oh you better not".

But im getting there.  First ride of first build is soooooo close.

Had to decide to either:
1. Show up at the event without any board and not build anything and hold off building till next year
or
2. Impulse buy and spend the $$$ on buying stuff I "need" for my first build(now builds)

Also a plane tickets cost about $1000 for me so having budget for an esk8 event for a Hobb- I mean passion that I just got into didn't really give me much of a choice :sob:

No complete board +no money = nothing to ride at Esk8Squad = pitiful scrolling through forum wishing to be back home ripping it 

Simple maths really

(edit: was born and raised in vegas, hence the "back home" bit)

1) College Applications
2) Club Meetings
3) Soccer Referee Assessment
4) Varsity Soccer League Championship Finals (I'm starting goalkeeper)
5) Two tests, two essays, and a presentation on Monday
6) Would've had to skip school and drive there (means making up all of those tests and presentation)

I'm not missing it next year. Don't care what it costs me

Alright you clowns, what happened this morning?? 
I was perfectly happy with my 17 likes and my 6th place spot and y'all go shove me up to _35 likes_, what am I supposed to do with these?! Now I have to find space on my stickers put my stickers! Gotta start learning how to make collages out these things...

Winner was @iKNOWaFATman in my book. Even if @12meterkuk did get more legit likes as he‚Äôs claiming, both he and myself cheated which would mean we‚Äôre both disqualified.
