Amazon has pulled all of those non-hovering fire starters. Long live the electric skateboard.

Always hated those things. Doesn't even hover, not even a board. 

:sigh: Guess I'll just have to keep self balancing myself. And start my own fires too...

Unfortunately shoddy Chinese batteries and manufacturing are to blame for this one. I hate that this lead to the classification of batteries as dangerous goods for shipping. Lots of those same hoverboard manufacturers from China want in on electric skateboards, so we're next...
