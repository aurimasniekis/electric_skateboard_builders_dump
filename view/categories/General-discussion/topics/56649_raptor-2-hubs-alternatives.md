Hey guys,

i just wanted to ask if there´re are any similar or even more powerfull hubs as the raptor 2 ones.

Thanks for your answers  :slight_smile:

@Hummie makes a very competitive model with the raptor boards with amazing support, super easy fixing (pretty much everything is replaceable) and incredibly high quality from the testimonies so far. I intend to pick some up and my biased opinion is you should too XD.

im excited to find out, but either way it goes i think both motors have enough power for most people and there are other important things too such as how does it feel and how durable are they.


but what would be a good power test? People ask "how powerful" but there's no standardized test and if youre in the desert or the arctic you'll have markedly different results.

And where could i buy your hubs?

if by specs you mean power im not sure what the focbox will put out and thats the biggest variable for that.  I set my escs to 100 motor amps and i forget what battery amps now but there's the power part decided there.  Speed..i dont think the raptor does 30mph and that's standard on the 9 turn motor i sell with 12s. 

i sell them through paypal for 500 a set with the other wheels and trucks

Yea since the Raptor 2 doesn't have a high top speed it's easy to stay full throttle and experiment with tucking and what's more efficient with your body, I've done 33mph on the 97mm Raptor 2 wheels so fun!

They aren't radial direct drive (hub motors) but even better are the axial direct drive system called "Carvon SpeedDrive XL" which should be coming out soon, will be the best direct drive on the market

At least, for now.  @torqueboards also has an axial direct drive system in the works.

For empirical measurements, I would compare things like coil resistance and continuous current rating. Both of those are kV dependent, so you'd need to wind a motor with the same kV as the Raptor 2 motor for a fair comparison.

But I think most people are more interested in real world testing like http://skatemetric.com/index.php/visualize-and-compare/

Edit: For comparing motors with different kV values, there's kM, the motor size constant, which is 1/(kV in rad/s x the square root of the coil resistance). This is a measure of how much torque the motor can produce for a given amount of heat produced, and remains the same no matter what kV you wind the motor for.

```
There are far more accurate ways to measure the winding resistance, but the VESC makes an estimate of resistance and kV in order to do FOC, so you can calculate kM just with the numbers from the VESC Tool. I'd love to get a spreadsheet of numbers together to compare all the motors.

Edit: I can't find the kV value in VESC Tool? It should be pretty easy to calculate.

Yes. Won't sell my r2 hubs though ;)

I'm thinking about buying hummies or carvons for my own DIY build. I want something like 10-12s 5p. It would be fun If I could test those motors on my Raptor 2 first.

Depending on what I like better the best motors will make it to my DIY, the others will stay under my Raptor 2.

Basically I want more torque, more top speed and more of everything else. Weight and cost are no problem.

youre going to need escs that can put out more amps and that's the bottleneck.    the motors only put out the torque related to their kv and circumference and the amps put to them as determined by the settings on the esc and what it can do

I’m hopefully going to be testing raptor2 hubs on 12S4P with VESC6 in a week or two. I never tried it on 10S (stock raptor) and focbox but 12S and more amps should make this thing quicker. I bet the heat will be the limit. The motor internals is the beefiest hub motors I’ve seen and they use magnets that sit without a gap. Love it!

This is the goal. But it will take a bit of time. The current design I have from @psychotiller of the six shooter for hummie hubs would be time consuming to switch between, so it would be more like a semi perminant setup (though with 5 minutes of time, you could switch).

Well after riding my Raptor 2 really hard the rear truck gets so hot it can burn you, another question is what is that heat doing to that bushing?  Either way my point is if you are going to run 12s on these hubs  pay very close attention to the temperature of the motors.

It's just so hard to predict anything. At this point, min of 3 hours in my mind to assemble each motor from start to finish. And that's doing large batches. I think it's more like 5 hours or more right now. so for the over 60 motors pre-ordered, thats over 300 hours of assembly time. Even if you say we can work 12 hours a day, that's still 25 x 12 hour days of work. This is no small feet. And I'm in position now where I need to find a full time job, and hummie also needs to find at least a part time job for the summer, which means time gets eaten from motor assembly. The reality is at these prices, we're not really making anything, which means we need to keep pumping outside money into these motors to keep progressing. That means the need of outside jobs, which eats time to find and do. 

The real limitation is man power and a continued need for money, since it's not coming from profits. The problem is that we keep taking pre-orders, which in the short term, solves the problem, but in the long term, doesn't since were still in the same hole later, it's just pushed off. Until we can get these motors in a place where they can be profitable, it will be a continued struggle. Love or hate it, the fact that enertion never sold low and always sold at high profit margins is a big reason they are doing as well as they are today.

Do you and hummie talk to eachother while working? You consistently say different things, according to hummie the motors are done.

And now you are saying 300hrs to assemble motors.

I don't know why or when he said motors are done... There's 6 motors fully assembled, 2 on his board and 4 on mine. Other than that, there's no completed motors. Theres 24 more motors that will be done with about another 1-2 hours each (just need final assembly and wheels, assuming no balancing is need, which could take an unknown amount of time). And another 20 ish that are 1/3rd of the way complete. I would say at this time, more like 150-200 hours left. Just was stating the enormity of why things take time. Lack of money to finish off the final parts due to a lack of profit margin, things go in and out of stock (polyurethane has been out of stock for a month now), and most importantly, the time it takes to assemble all of the motors.

[/quote]

sorry for that if that's what I said exactly.  I think I must have been meaning the challenges of the motors are done.  With a gamble after an improperly made sample by the manufacturer and with so many changes from the past and everything untested based on assumptions it was a gamble.


I was just writing back and forth with aend a minute ago.  its may be naïve on my part but the first response from them was it can be made in 5 weeks and i think they said 2000$ to start but it was totally doable, but then you find its just gets you a prototype singular mold, and need two, and each wheel will cost you like 50$, so you need to get the 100 molds that they pour in under an hour and at the minimum of 500 parts made its expensive.   Tried to find room between what amounts to an all or nothing deal with every polyurethane "processor" I could find going through the pu Manufacturers Assoc.   There are a lot of companies not on there as well I found.  Its pretty weird how non-public these places are and hard to find.  

I can do them. I have reasons why it's hard now on this small scale but it's good.  it will be good.  and we will all get fucking motors and tires within 6 weeks.  yea I said it and said a lot of crap.    I'm off work next Wednesday.   I will be paying rent a month early and just pouring wheels till this is done.  It cant be done as a part-time thing and the molds need to be pre-heated as well as everything else to 200f and post cured for 16 hours.  its good though and I have the bucks for the resins for the rubber and it's core and for molds. 

I hope you guys believe me when I say stuff and I'm stunned at the times Ive said 2 weeks.  at this point I'm shipping out the first motors to Seth with the last of the tires I made before ran out of resin and he gets them cause he's been yelling at me over the email and told me its a joke at this point!    It's looking like i'll be buying 10 gallons on the 30th after talking to Creative Urethanes earlier who were the best lead for cheap possibilities in bulk but across the board it's showing to be about  5,000$ min but he said he'll tell me tomorrow and Aend said theyd tell me more tomorrow.  the price though really ends up 10,000$ but also while they say it will take 6 weeks its seemingly starts from when they finally start thinking about it.  these places have a lot of business and I'm in line.  Funny they actually pour wheels at super speed like 100 in an hour, with the 100 molds you have to buy, and the likely 500 part minimum, and that's an expensive minimum.   None of them still after like ..dare I say two weeks..have an answer on how much something will be and Ive been told to slow my roll and these are slow.  so fuck that and I can pour these now.     Pu should be available on the 30th they still say and shipping to me was maybe 4 days.  off on Wednesday.  

these motors don't take as long as evohyax says.  if I ever happen to stumble on a go pro I can make a video and speed it up like 30x and you can see what happens.  You guys are all my investors.  I hear stupid talk of making big money and big production but the reality is, and maybe always will be, I'm making these and I can do them quickly.  takes a bit of gearing up and know how and this and that and a lot of time off work.  I'm looking forward to it.  they will be fucking awesome.


can someone please link these to the other thread so the other folk who paid know whats up

You live in a bubble dude.
These are the minimum times it takes to do each task:

Winding - 30 minutes
Dipping - 20 minutes
Pressing - 20 minutes
Terminating - 10 minutes
Re cutting truck - 10 minutes
Magnets gluing and cleaning - 1 hour
Assembly with retaining fluid - 20 minutes
Testing and phase wires - 20 minutes

That's over 3 hours right there. That doesn't include bell balancing either. This is assuming your on fire, not taking breaks or making any mistakes that result in complications. This also assumes all tools are sitting out, ready to be used, and theres no time looking for tools, which is never the case.

It takes time to make motors.
