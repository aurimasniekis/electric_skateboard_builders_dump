Hello guys!! Need find enclosure for my build, this is old school skateboard deck (33’ x 10’) short wheel base, enclosure must be around 6’ x 12’. Costume enclosure would be the best but don’t have much time and access to tools. Somebody here building enclosures. 
Been looking around but didn’t find nothing that fits my needs. ![image|415x443](upload://q6lnlzqzHEGcS3cREjKAZ2uB4dc.jpeg)

I believe @Eboosted is working on a kut-thaka enclosure right now and that seems pretty similar. Also check out here:
