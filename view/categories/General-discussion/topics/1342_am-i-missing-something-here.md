So for my build I'm planning on running 2 6s 8000mAh Zippy FlightMax in series as a 12s pack. I clicked to order from the USA West warehouse and the price dropped by almost half! Are deals like this common? Is there something I'm just totally overlooking?? Link: http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/uh_viewitem.asp?idproduct=20647

Just confirm it via live chat. Seems legit to me, it's a really good catch though I don't like the bulkyness :smiley:

Yeah as much as I don't like the super tall 50mm+ batteries, its hard to find anything in a flat style like the SPACE cell without going over $125+.

That's true. I just don't want to deal with the complexity of running 4 3s batteries in parallel and in series. 2x6s1p is much easier, if more bulky.

Hahah dude they're all out! I've tried to order them since December. They process the order and then give me the money back a week later. They're all out in all warehouses. Last time I tried was 4 days ago. They sent me my money back 
I even have the email if u wanna see it. Live chat says they're in stock but if you ask them to further investigate it they realize they're out. I went off on them twice for not updating the store

And if you want these packs to be more flat just open them up and de solder the mid way point. Open it up like a book and re solder the connection that's what I do. Cut the depth in half

I never thought of doing that, I thought cutting lipo packs open is dangerous and has potential to destroy the cells it self. But I might try later!

The Space Cell will fit your needs without having to cut into hazardous lipo cells. 

In addition, the Space Cell uses 18650 cells so it will be much hardier than a standard lipo.

It is at least something worth checking out regardless of whether or not you feel that it is in your budget.

No, you do not cut into any cells just slowly peel the cells apart. It's safe unless you're using a knife or blade. Use a credit card to pry it open

The multistar packs aren't even glued.  I just folded them over with a bunch of insulation jammed beside the leads coming out and reshrink wrapped them.

These HK sales are awesome :) You can never run out of a great deal. LiPo's for the win.

i saw an electric motorcycle company in u.s.a  in youtube of a person showing the physical shape of every li ion cell . and its wonderfully flat . could be 10mm thick . unlike turbular 18650 . i forgot the  youtube thread . and i cant find any cell company selling them .

yea if you had the know how, you could make a pack that spans the entire board but would be extremely thin!  What you can do is just buy some lipos and use the cells.

talking about prismatics?

http://www.all-battery.com/Li-Polymer3.7v_5000plus.aspx

i've toyed with the idea... i've seen a few people carve out their decks and lay 6 or 8 of these along the bottom of the deck in the channels they dug, then seal them in and they only had to box the ESC. 

Its been done with success. Its just difficult compared to buying a lipo from hobbeyking (good luck they're all on backorder!) and stuffing it in a sandwich box or fabbing your own box. you also get a better price on individual cells when you buy the whole unit fro a hobbey store and tear apart the pack. They're basically the same cells as far as i can tell though. 

the result is highly desireable though with uber stealth. One day i will try this. Maybe sooner than later now that i can press 9 ply decks, and possibly even 11 ply.
