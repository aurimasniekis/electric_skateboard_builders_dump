So sitting here in the ER, I've decided i need to stick to longer boards.... and avoid large rocks at high speeds

Good luck in there. Stick to the fat tires and wheels! ðŸ¤™

Yikes. Looks painful. 

I started this hobby off with a short board two years ago. Never again.

If your young and ripping up a skate park there great but if your old like me and ride on public streets it's better to stick to a long board with larger wheels.

Yeah. It's the speed that make short boards sketchy. That said I have a Jet Spud that I keep at the office for lunch runs but I never go fast with that

I broke my arm at a skate park back in the late 70's. Even wearing all the safety equipment won't keep you from hurting yourself every once an awhile. 

I just bought a skate helmet last week. I am trying to be careful. Hope you feel better.

41" deck with 97mm wheels is my choice I can ride straight up a 1 1/2 inch curb no pop without slowing or wobbling at 22mph 
Shortboards kick like a mule on the streets here in Edinburgh

Thanks dude. I have had a spiral fracture from trick boarding when i was young and dumb. I should have paid more attention since it was my first ride with this short of a deck... so while getting stitched up i began searching for a new deck. The eskate gods have made me a disciple in only a few months and a little rock in the road isnâ€™t gonna stop me. Just means i have to start researching a build with tires

Might wanna consider pads too while you're shopping for a new deck.

Edit: heal up well.
