I fell and crushed my storm trooper ruroc before I could make a mold of the visor which I personally really like. I wanted to put this Gopro compatible mount and visor on helmets. But a damn giant invisible (bright yellow) traffic barrier got in the way of these plans. 

Hereâ€™s my fix to have a castable master for later. Took only 20 mins after an argument with a misinformed ladyfriend about statistics and medicine ended a stupid dinner date.

Obviously, Iâ€™m getting a new one. No shit Sherlock, they are made for one crash. Also, leaning toward DOT approved this time.

Don't Ruroc helmets already come with a GoPro style mount? Or is this an adapter for all helmets?
Sorry about your dinner date, hope at least the food was good and she paid her halfðŸ˜‰

Oh @Arzamenable you got 99 problems, the B ainâ€™t supposed to be one

Are DOT helmet meant for multiple impacts. Thatâ€™s the one think that sucks about the Ruroc and TSG. Expensive to replace

They do have them, but I broke mine a day before casting a mold of it.

I think the paralegal in me would say that even after one impact resulting in visible damage/deformed foam, DOTs are no good. 

Yeah, gonna pop in some Jay z and terrorize the SD harbor.
