Hi ðŸ‘‹

I've been concentrating on my skate speakers a lot recently so I haven't been on here much. And our weather has been sucking as well so not much riding. How is everyone doing?

Hello there @Sapphirinia 

Since you use your esk8 for your musical gigs, what do you do in the sucky weather?

Here in Paris, France, this morning we had a blast ride and it was sunny ! An event of "Formule E" attends in Paris this weekend so there is a racing car track in the city (a "circuit" if it exists in english). It's for electric car going to more than 200 km/h. We were allowed a 35-40 min session, to promote electric mobilities in general. So much fuc***g fun, with some fancy dress people !

Anyway, @Sapphirinia look at those pics while you wait for the sun :slight_smile:

You know, the usual, spending too much tine on here, not enough time riding and actually finishing projects!
