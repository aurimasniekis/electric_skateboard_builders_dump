So today I rode through a swarm of gnats at 20mph and unfortunately for me my Visor was open, I did not even see the swarm I was just riding and all of a sudden I hear their little bodies explode all in rapid succession agrainst my helmet and I feel a few hit me in the face it was bad. My right eye took a good hit kinda hurts but it looks fine and it's not swollen, I still will see a doctor though. 


I can only imagine how bad this would have been if I had a half cap instead of a tsg pass.

Do you guys have any bad insect stories while riding?

I smoked a red colored bird with my motorcycle face shield.  Knocked my head back a little.  That was at 30ish.

Besides that, bugs and dust are common things smacking my face while riding.

The old pass visor..there is a Mar right in the middle from a dragon fly... I try to keep my visor down at all times.. unless I'm talking to a rider... I hate everything in my eyes...

I see a lot of mosquito swarms, I try to avoid them. When I can't I just suffer through it until I can stop. Sucks.

There is a certain spot I ride through that ALWAYS has a huge swarm of gnats.  If I don't have safety glasses on, I slow way down or squint.  I've caught at least ten with my eyeballs on separate occasions and there are frequently bicycles pulled over [right there](https://www.google.com/maps/place/38%C2%B038'34.7%22N+90%C2%B016'27.2%22W/@38.6429869,-90.2829848,15z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x0:0x0!7e2!8m2!3d38.6429708!4d-90.2742299) with the riders rubbing their eyes...

I just wear clear safety glasses during the night, or shades during the day.

Had to go without it once, had to squint while riding around. Dusk is the worst time.......

Ha! Funny you mentioned this. Last month I was riding in Las Vegas with @psychotiller, @MoeStooge and @treenutter when we went through, about, 10 swarms of gnats. Got one in my eye, although I was wearing sunglasses. Thought I got it out in Vegas. The next day ,back in Anaheim, Iâ€™m rubbing my eye and out comes the gnat. The rest of the day my eye kept tearing and the next day my eye was puffy and crusty and I had to get on a plane to Chicago. Needless to say it was fine the next day. Thatâ€™s the last time I ride in that part of Vegas.:smile:

I've been trying for a year, seems like life is dead set in keeping me from getting there ðŸ˜„. 

I am going to Miami this summer, I'll get to ride with @Battosaii and his crew I hope.

Iâ€™m reading this stuff out loud to my wife right now we are both like ðŸ˜³ðŸ¤¢ðŸ¤®. I rode with my new TSG twice and ended up with the visor opened up a little to get more air. Guess I wonâ€™t be doing that anymore. Canâ€™t imagine hitting a dragonfly

Yeah, need more DIY group rides in SoCal. The last two were good but itâ€™s weird riding with mostly Evolve fanboys.

Have not had an issue with spiders, many daddy long legs but they don't bother me. Imo the gnats are the worse it's like they want you to eat them...

I ride through swarms of gnats often and keep my lid down, but I get the occasional bumblebee or other large black insect pinging off my visor as well.

Was going down the sidewalk , went to go around pedestrians while passing a bar, sped right into a huge pile of fresh puke. Flung all up on my clothes and on my board.

The puke was covered in insects right, otherwise it's off-topic.
