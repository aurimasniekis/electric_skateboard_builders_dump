[quote="willpark16, post:1, topic:43993"]
Pending his accident about a month ago which left him in and out of icu
[/quote]

Not to discredit this at all and hope he's better

But you say this was a month ago...and seeing how active his account has been... What kind of relapse are you talking about?... 

Because 3 days ago he was working with carbon fiber. Got me a little confused...ICU.... working with composites.. how does that work? Not trying to be a dick.

[quote="willpark16, post:225, topic:37579, full:true"]
I just taught myself an $80 lesson yesterday trying to make a carvon fiber deck it‚Äôs all in the game brother

Get well soon.

## \#35 Posted by: willpark16 Posted at: 2018-01-18T15:27:37.585Z Reads: 248

The short answer would be it doesn't, the accurate answer would be that he has been getting help in order to keep the buisness running, in not sure if u understand what it takes to be admitted into icu nowadays but the only way you are getting in is if it is not certain weather or not you will make it. The injuries sustained from the accident can have a 6 month to 1 year full recovery time and nor are they all physical. This was simply to make people he had worked close with aware of his absence for the time being and his customers to know that he did not bail and of his current impairments. Ur skepticism isn't very much appreciated if I'm being honest considering the amount of time and help he has given to members of this forum. Thank you again to everyone who had good wishes! Once he is better I will have him personally handle his own account. As for the carbon fiber he was working with another member on a prototype he personally never was physically involved in the assembly process because he was unable to properly run his buisness along with completely return to his daily schedule and duties

Hey again. I meant no offense. Just a little light with the timeline could help the community understand.

Injuries is kind of vague. Again, I hope he is well. 

PS ICU from injuries typically means head trauma or organ trauma(organ trauma can include large bones that are susceptible to Iinternal bleeding ie Femur). ICU otherwise is typically blood related levels. 

I'm not a skeptic, I'm a realist, I live in facts. Sorry if I offended you asking for more of the facts. Wish your brother well.

My advice to anyone having ongoing business with @willpark16 would be to wait until the realwillpark stands up. Having a "stranger" telling people that he/she will be handling someones unfinished business transactions, with no previous heads up from Will himself, should raise a red flag imho. Will's been posting daily for the last month and at the same time being in and out of ICU? Doesn't make sense to me. 

Hopefully there is a good explanation for what's going on and let's just hope Will is ok.

And of course, if @willpark16 is injured/ or whatever happened to him, I wish him a speedy recovery.

@willpark16

I am so sorry to hear about this, I wish Will a speedy recovery and my sympathy goes out to you and the rest of your family.

Please forgive the sceptical questions, there was an incident very recently where someone provided potentially erroneous information which caused further hurt to the family. I think folks are just trying to to avoid the same situation again.
