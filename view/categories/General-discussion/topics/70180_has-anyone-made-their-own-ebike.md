Just wondering. There's this guy who made one and it uses a lot of parts I already have (vesc,6374. other things)

The second one I'm in love with. Need to do more research, its a shame bikes get stolen so easily. That's what happened to my regular bike a couple years back

Stealing is the only reason I haven't built one yet, but I'm trying to figure out ways to prevent it from being stolen. Rfid tags, keys, etc. I will have to figure it out. 

That being said, they seem arguably easier to build if you use a hub motor.

Exactly, if I'm gonna do it I'm gonna do it right and I know it's gonna be expensive and biggest thing is that I probably won't use it much so it will sit at home most of the time so for me it's not worth my money or time even though I think it's cool as hell.  

If I was looking for everyday transportation to replace my car I'd go for an ebike over esk8 but Im not.

Endless-sphere has a lot of bike projects.  They use somewhat different parts.  Its often like 16s, with a giant ESC capable of 100A continuous, stuff that we typically dont use because a) it wont fit on the board and b) most of us dont actually want that much power on a skateboard for traction/safety reasons.

I just started to order parts for an eeb build. Hyped as fuck but it's an expencive build.. I've also seen that dude build hes bikes. Very temted to cnc some parts for a more regular ebike, and use a spare focbox and other eskate parts for it.

Do consider upgrading the motor though, 25 mph is much less exciting on a bike than on a board.  This monster is like 1.5x a typical 6374.

Oh yeah, its definitely possible.  I have my board geared to 25 mph with a single 6374, and it has enough torque to easily climb the hills around here in the Bay Area.  You can calculate how much torque you'll get at the wheel, and how much acceleration it'll be capable of, it's an exercise worth doing.  Also, you should consider your battery solution.  A lot of people here like to use 18650 cells, but the whole point of a 6374 is the 75A that it should be capable of, which would require at LEAST a 4p configuration.  Not sure what kind of range you're going for, but if 4p is too much/heavy, consider hobby lipos.  Then again, it's easier to fit a giant battery pack on a bike than on a board, so if you dont mind the weight and cost, a 12s6p pack would get you a LOT of range, and weigh much less than comparable capacity packs in other formats.

Since weight is not a real issue and space is also not an issue you could also think about other battery formats which are more cost efficient.

I have been building my baby lately to get me around town. Slowly progressing in the right direction. Running a Trampa VESC 6 now and 16s1p Headway 15ah with 80a max batt and 120a max motor. With sensors, it's very good up until about 15 mph where I am getting some chatter. Think I need to use retaining fluid on the bearing and bearing shafts like eskate hub motors since I have some rattle since I took it apart last week.

oh yea. It's just under 1 kilowatt of power! If I eco moded it, I could do an easy 40-50 miles. But the way I ride it, I'm lucky to get 10 miles, haha.

Simple charging, just 1 xt90 loop key for power, and 1 xt90 for charging with the meanwell 12a beast! So full charge is just over an hour. These cells literally balance themselves if left in a close enough range, and I've had no issue in over 700 miles so far with cells becoming un-balanced.

Thinking - Might make a friction drive, and use a 6374  or a direct drive motor (connected to a esk8 wheel), if it works it will be amazing

Or forget the wheel and design something suitable where its not required

And of course make it look nice :)

I am currently building an electric moped, it was gas powered that I am converting. 
I.ve built a few ebike as well, I recommend using the 1500 W hub motor with a focbox it works like a charm and I like the motor breaking function way batter than the Chinese e brakes. 

For extended rides you must add thermal mass to dissipate the heat of the vesc , a focbox case will do the trick.

Got same idea to make diy ebike ... around 2007 to 2010 surfing ES and dreaming of all of it.
Then I told myself to think smaller, Paris and a bike like this will a problem during work time (stolen issues already with fixie and vtt at home ...).
So I start with esk8.
I still got the idea in mind, and want to do it one day with a single esk8 setup ! Like my little e-Dirt scooter.

I'm sure I will use more my bike if it is e-powered a bit to help me :blush: 
I just make some photoshop and try to find how to make the 2 stage transmission middle drive ... this will take me some year I guess :smile:

```
Only started with electric skateboards because people like to steal bikes, had mine stolen the only solution I could think was to build an electric skateboard that way you can take it with you where ever you go instead of leaving it outside "locked up" for someone to take. Personally I like high powered ebikes over skateboards but sometimes you have to compromise.

I've built ebikes before and for high speed runs and silence nothing beats the 80 volts or greater rear wheel hub, aliexpress has all you need if your looking to build this type of bike, for mid drives cyclone, gng, or lighting rods are used with higher voltages, usually require good skills to setup well, there are prebiuld drive units like the bbshd, bosh etc you can buy but they are the most expensive for the power they deliver. Mid drives are more efficient compared to hubs so give more range for the same amount of batteries and are favoured for off road use, hubs can still be used off road but their unsprung back wheel can become a problem in sandy environments they also require more batteries and are overall heavier then the mid drives. 

Best thing going for ebikes at the moment is the sur ron light bee google it you wan't be disappointed.

Yeah, I was trying to avoid heavy hub motors in favor of a lightweight bike

It's been awhile since I've been on here but thought I'd chime in. I love my ebike - a single speed Brooklyn Bike Co. Wythe with a Bafang mid drive kit and powder coated battery. I wanted something lightweight just to get me around town. This ended up being more practical for my commute than the esk8.

Oh shit, Run is back on the forums.  I won't lie, that looks dope as hell, but my wallet is screaming at me because I know this shit is money!  Awesome creation, any video?

Anyway have any recommendations for a good hub setup for my e-drift trike build?

Lol yeah but with a bike you can always find some used deals locally or maybe you already own one that's been sitting in the garage, so it's really just the cost of the battery and the kit. Not much to my build actually, here's what I got:

Damn, that isn't bad.  I have a single speed MTB, but definitely not converting that to an ebike.  But you are right, I could find a cheap craiglist TREK or Mongoose online to convert.  Thanks for the links!

Still need vids, lol..what can I say, I like videos!

its also important to have a controller with a high FET count on ebike motors makes them run more quite and more efficient.

I also bought that Bafang motor (but "only" 250W version since anythign above is illegal in Germany).
Will mount it to this:
![image|690x457](upload://i3joYhXxvqwXfDTZjGWxYyNMJVv.jpeg) 

For all the DIYers: the bafang is actually kind of boring since you don't even need a separate ESC - it's all in that motor housing and all you need is a battery.

I did make 2 friction drive ebikes. They work relatively amazing. Doesnt weight as much as mid drive or hub motors and can still do about 45kph / 26mph on flat.

Though there needs to be 'sleeve' on the motor to work nicely,  otherwise there is a lot of slippage if bare motor can is used.

Ideal kv for 5065 size motor is about 270kv - 320kv, then max speed can be attained.

For 60' size motor someone could go with 200-215kv to achieve best results.

When in use u cant really 'gun it', throttle needs to be given gradually, so there is enough grip.

Wouldn't a hub motor be ideal with the urethane shell? But maybe too low kv?

Yeh it would be slow as hell.. even 63' size with 170kv could bring me up to only 30-35kph on motor power alone..

Well, as always biggest hurdle is making a mount and attaching everything. My friend who owns the bike I helped make electric, made a system with lever, where he can detach motor from wheel when out of juice or when it is not needed.

---
Ive seen hub motors made as mid drives with chain / sprocket attachment, in that application it might work nicely and doesnt need the huge gear ratios RC / our outrunners would need to drive wheel directly

I would prefer direct connection with wheel using gearbox of sorts, as I would love more speed out of it and at some point it needs pedal assist to go  to the max speed.

---

It is also very economical on battery. I get about 8-10wh/km riding relatively fast (30-35kph). That is with cycling also, not sure how much it eats when cruising on motor only.. 

I do let it go 35kph on motor only when I need to relax the legs but when I can I cycle also to help with speed / battery life

---

This is what is needed for nice grip

Also feel free to check up on this:
https://turbobobbicycleblog.wordpress.com/2016/05/25/add-e-electric-bike-conversion-kit-lightweight-power/amp/

They dont use spring to drive motor against the wheel. Relies on inertia for contact with tire. Though in my experiments due to motor angle / position with inertia it was not enough to get good grip

Loved your build and watching you ride the bike! I was interested in what you were saying about the magnet in the motor being affected by the mount. I'm wondering why that's not more of an issue with motor mounts for esk8 considering the motor is typically mounted right to it. Does it have anything to do with the choice of material used to make your mount? Also if your gearing on the right side is a 2:1 ratio are you only really getting half the power you could get if you could mount it without the magnetic interference? Love the project!! ❤

Anybody good with UART and the bafang kit?
I installed my motor but the display wants a password to start up :frowning:
The guy I got the kit from says I can send it back to have a technician fix it for me or buy a new display (which is ridiculously expensive to China). 
But I got the idea that it should in theory be possible to reverse engineer the protocol and make my own display no? Anybody got an idea on how to do this the easiest way?

250w with the official spec but according to the controller programming it is set to a max current of 15A. It can apparently take batteries up to 48v so you can squeeze much more watts out of this thing. I just did an uphill climb on 10S with an average current of 12A for 18min - that's around 430W and plenty if you want a bicycle and not a motorbike.

Yup I don't think there's any hw difference between 250-500w or even up to 1000w.
Might have to build a commuter with bafang middrive just so I can use my spare 10s battery.
Did you have any overheating issues while doing that 18min uphill climb?
And are you using Vesc?

The bafang middrive has a built-in controller. No overheating as far as I can tell. Felt actually quite cool when I touched it.
