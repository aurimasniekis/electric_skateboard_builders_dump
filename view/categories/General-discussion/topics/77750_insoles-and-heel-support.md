My heels had been killing me lately after riding.
Curious if anyone out there have the same experience.
If anyone uses special insoles or heel support or does anything else to cushion your feet

I use these for my AJ1s when I ride, but board feel is likely to suffer (YMMV) since the forefoot has gel support underneath.

That, or if you're up for it, Vans Ultracush soles are very comfortable for skating imo. Though, they don't sell soles separately..

I have a degenerative disease called Achilles tendinopathy. Very painful. Unfortunately I'm going to require surgery in the next few years. Needless to say I just ordered some protalus inserts I will be trying those out in the next few days. I have some custom-made and personally formed orthotic inserts but they don't work very well in my opinion. I'll keep you updated once I get a chance to try out these new inserts.

I have two layers of "odor eaters" insoles in my shoes to help add some cheap cushion.....and to stop stinky feet.

I wear gel orthotics in my shoes and make the ride quite a bit smoother, they are also good for the arches in your feet

I have always had complete cripple feet, and since I got custom fitted insoles, the ride has been hella smoother

I use sorbothane. Amazing impact and vibration absorption, plus on this model there is a heel cup to keep your foot properly aligned.

Ride more and train your heels, this happened to me when I was riding long distances at the time (10-15miles) but I started riding 50 miles daily over the summer of 2018 and that trained my legs and feet to never get tired and now I can go for 75 mile rides and still be fine

I've done lots of testing on this matter and wasted too much money on insoles but this really works well.

https://www.noene.com/en/product/universal-no2-insoles/  (the 2mm inserts)

https://www.drscholls.com/products/pain-relief/orthotics-for-heavy-duty-support/

I wear the hightop pro vans but I removed the ultracush insoles and inserted both of these.  I was using the noene and ultracush together which wasn't bad but once I switched to these drschools orthotics for people that weight 200-300 lbs the difference was huge.  My feet feel so much better.  I weight 195lbs.  I haven't tried the Drschools alone but even with both inserts the shoes still feel loose.  I highly recommend using both of them together.

I change my dr scholes monthly-bimonthly. But really its just matter of riding more as others have said. Eventually you won't feel your feet, and they just become feedback devices for the road underneath you.

True. I've ridden over 2,100 miles since January and just tried them a couple rides ago. I noticed the difference after the first ride but everyone rides differently. Just giving my two cents.

Ah no. Also I can feel the board better with Dr scholls then the ultracush insoles.

So dr scholes compress over time?  I thought the gel material were suppose to last.

dirt, sweat, and millions of vibrations. they microshear internally and loose their support

pretty much all supoort for feet are designed for compression and rebound. you stand on your board so they are in compressed state. Add micro vibrations and sweat and dirt it basically turns into abrasion while compressed - as the soles never go into rebound. 

but thats with anything, add in sufficient vibrations when a.material is close to its material strength limit and things start wearing exponentially faster.

I'll have to report back in a few months then.  Maybe the extra noene inserts will help minimize the microshearing in the dr scholls inserts.

That was directed at @Ixf as everyone knows the first few weeks of skateing your ankles feet or Achilles hurt because of new muscle you have never used.

I been on eskate for almost 2 years now. ;) 
I gone through the phase of having burn on the rear legs
Figuring out the posture.
Shifting the weight.
Pain isn't on the muscle but rather right on the heels.
Wasn't a problem with the BGT or my EVO DIY.  The pain seem to have started with the trampa decks.
Bindings seem to have made it worse since the whole foot is pretty much always on the board.  I can't lift the back of my foot to take pressure off.

[/quote]

Definitely about foot position and sustained contact.  You'd think that the rock hard evo would be less forgiving than the flex of a trampa but the fact that you can shift your feet helps a bunch.  I have only ridden a trampa for a couple of hours with bindings and it did affect my legs more than anything without them.  I just put it down to new board but thinking about it logically staying in one place for an extended period does change the effect of fatigue.  Its going to take some more training to get used to the new position. I tend to get fatigue now even if I'm sitting still though so wtf do I know?

Deck is part of it. 
The torque and the shoes probably are contributing factors too.
I swapped to flat shoes, they hold better on the curved trampa deck but they really don't cushion the heels like my running shoes do. 
I also got a pretty large step up in terms of torque
Yes you should shift the weight in front but when you are hard accelerating your back foot is going to feel some of the pressure.  
But regardless of why my heel hurts and I am probably going to get a set of vans + insoles and see if it improves at all :D
