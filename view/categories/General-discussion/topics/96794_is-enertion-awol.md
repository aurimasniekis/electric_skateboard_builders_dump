Hey Carl thanks for replying.  Ive sent you a video and explabantion of my problems via the support ticket email. Ive seen videos where enertion said it was ok to bend the power wires to 90 on the unity yet when i did it the unit arched out becuse they stacked the positive and negative on the same tab and i guess the wires somewhere inside the heat shrink was exposed to each other. Anyway when it arched i immediatly unolugged battery and want to remove the unity and noticed the power cables were wiggly. And that the tab for those cabled has severed about 90% all the aya through snd was hanging on barley. At this point i cant even appy power to tbe unity do i dont even know if it works or not.

[/quote]
I don't think that's the case as every time we provide the delivery time, it's always been an ETA which is an estimate and has several factors involved. So, there are always chances of the change in ETA (honestly speaking). We always tried to let you guys know about each and every delay.

[quote="ju5t, post:24, topic:96794"]

[/quote]

I am not sure if we are breaking the law as I see many likely terms and conditions of many online vendors and product provider. Also, worth mentioning, there is a checkbox before placing the order which states that do you agree to our terms and conditions, that's the chance where customer can read and then decide. As a customer, I will definitely read the T & C before placing the order because there is no point whining about it after placement of the order as you agreed to them.

You can say that for the cars and stuff as well if you mean dangerous they are.
We are not the only one shipping boards (sorry E-boards) to the USA and EU.
and we are not the only one having issues with the electronic thing. have you seen the community?

In the end, if you think it's dangerous then you can stop riding or buying it. That's the best way of safety, isn't it? :wink:

Wait what? Like same location but opposite sides of pcb? And this on a device that's meant for almost 60V and hundreds of potential amps?? Hahahaha wow! ok I mean I'm only an inexperienced EE but that seems like asking for trouble. Anything from moisture build up to frayed wires will cause a meltdown.

Agreed. The people who were banned weren‚Äôt exactly polite and that IS one of the rules around here.

God I wish Enertion just did electronics & DIY parts only. They are the best at that and still are for the foreseeable future! Myself and much of the esk8 community will overlook this delays in a few years if they dump the Raptor and focus on the FOCBox single & Unity. Everyone LOVES them despite very minor issues here and there (plz fix the CAN shorting issue with the FOCBox when the CAN wire is disconnect & re-release it!!!), the pre-built boards and hubs are hit & miss.

I‚Äôm not sure how big the DIY electronics market is, but I do know it‚Äôs growing and requires way less effort and capital to produce and provide warranty support. Just stick to that! You have Jeff so put him to work and just do electronics!

@Risewithin

Took me a while to understand your issue.

The Fsesc, battery wires on same side of pcb, enough space between them.

Old single Focbox, battery wires on opposite pcb sides, secured with glue between the caps.
![image|500x499](upload://5Cmx7LzpqGdjIjyOB7clSjL21GJ.jpeg) 

Focbox unity, opposite pcb sides, but on a tab at the edge of the pcb. if the soldering is botched or the shrinking tube gets damaged... I wasn't happy with the position of the battery wires at the side, theres a lot of rubbing going on

There waz absolutley no epoxy or silicone. Held up by solder alone and some heat shrink. I think on mine the heat shrink must have come out a little or something allowing the wires to touch wach other. Just be extremely careful when moving those wires or go in and epoxy the shit out of this area.

Eskating is always going to be dangerous, we have to accept that fact and that no mechanism is 100% safe as you would like it to be.

If you are going 30mph, your ESC is not the only thing which can have trouble and kill you. What if your bearing pops or your wheel falls out? you are going to crash either way..

If you dont trust Focboxes, then dont use them, its as simple as that.

I have trust in Enertion to fix any issues they have, and in the meantime if you dont feel like using it, just wait until they come out with an improved version as no one is forcing you to buy/use it.

I always say things before implementing them on myself. I have had many accidents on my Raptor 2 due to my own foolishness in the beginning so it's not kind of rude. I still think about it this way.

The simple thing is give up on riding the E-board or keep testing your self. It may sound rude but it's a fact.

is there a thread/topic where this is ouitlined on how we can fix this issue or try and prevent it?

I see the guys post below this where the + and _ wires are on opp sides of the board is this the same issue or something else?

appologies to be asking you but Enirtion will not give direct straight clear answers on these things. They would rather people get hurt than admit something isnt right.

appologies to be asking you but Enirtion will not give direct straight clear answers on these things. They would rather people get hurt than admit something isnt right.

Not sure if we are on the fault at that situation but I think it will be better if you do the research on that case first.
I haven't seen any case with that symptoms, would like to dive deeper if you have some source :slight_smile:

Always happy to admit if the fault is from our side +  happy to solve the situation. Answering the situation is not necessary, solving is necessary :slight_smile:

Och carl. There is a difference between caused by own foolishness and caused by the vendor (what reason ever. Being it by accident/qc/soft/hw/marketing). As vendor you have a responsibility, come on..
"sorry you lost all your money on your bank account you have with us here at Bank of X,due to our new server here we lost all data. Sorry. But hey, didn't you test this yourself as customer?" 
Or
"hey its not our fault our cars started accelerating by itself after locking the doors. We patched it now, but still not our fault" 

But ok, whatever.. I know it would not fly in any of the companies i did CS for, but if it works for you: :+1:

I never said we haven't taken the responsibility or denied any of it.
I think you have to ask other customers that I always accept if issue is due to our product malfunctioning.
But here on the forum, the thing is everyone only focus on the little thing (without doing research on it) and forget the other major things done.

For the ESC and board, as it's programmable, there are likely chances of things caused by own foolishness, that's why I always prefer investigation before admitting things. 
But Again, in the end, we are more than happy to admit things if done by the manufacturers and will do as much as we can to make it right.

So, don't worry mate! I will not rest until all of the ongoing issues are resolved, that's the commitment I can show :slight_smile:

One more thing: I do understand how customer feel and I am happy to be an advocate of the customer. (Which is still I am doing)

is there a thread/topic where this is ouitlined on how we can fix this issue or try and prevent it?

There is one solution: Solder and hot glue the sonofabitch.

Hahaha yep. Silicone or hot glue would be an easy fix!! I highly recommend doing this straight out of the box to save the headache of having to go through the warranty process. And thank you @CarlCollins for helping me and so many people on this thread.

My BMS blown 2 weeks ago. Wrote Bara and he shipped a new one immediately. Tomorrow it should arrive at my home (germany).

My Raptor HUB had a defective Hall Sensor. Bara shipped me also a new one. So maybe i'm just lucky.

im not 100% sure which wires are the problem wires still and where to glue them!

a clear thread with guidance and photos should be an opportunity to re-gain that reputation you keep dragging through the mud

Where the power wires attach to the board. If any part  wire is exposed past the board there is a good chance they will make contact together. They cover this section up with a heat shrink but you have to take that off in  order to see the wires so apply some silicone at the solder joint and in between the wires and then apply a new heat shrink back on.
