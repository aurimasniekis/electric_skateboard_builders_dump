You buy a new board.. JK you could change the ratio to lower and put bigger wheels on, but the acceleration will suck. And I dont think trucks will be stable on so high speed and you will get woobles and will crash

You can get to about 55km, 200kv motors, 107mm wheels & use a 32t gear... but as mentioned above the acceleration/ braking will suck...board bumpers do have a 19t motors pulley & 23t wheel pulley im sure that would get you a bit more speed as well...

```
1. Take off trucks and replace with trucks that can handle over 55km. Something with a large hanger width.
2. Replace wheels potentially 110mm wheels.
3. Replace battery to 12s / 13s.
4. Replace esc.
5. Come to realisation you have an evolve and the amount youve just spent you should have built a diy from scratch.

6a. Build diy

or

6b. Cry because youre confused and have 1.5 boards that dont work.

7a. Have DIY that goes 70km. Have fun!

Or

7b. Contact @mackann and buy a bioboard. 

Good luck mate.

DH riders choose narrow trucks for a reason, you basically extend the effective wheelbase. 
(I'm no DH rider so please correct me if I'm wrong)

```
1. Get a friend with a pickup truck or a car that has a bike holder on the trunk
2. Stand on the board, hold to the truck/car
3. Tell the friend to accelerate to 70+km/h
4. ???
5. Profit (most likely from life/death insurance)

First on your shopping list should be a set of brown trousers, and maybe a hula skirt for the epic wobbles you're going to get going that speed on a set of Evolves.

You spend 4K on all the parts to modify a cgt. 

Edit: there is no sarcasm or jest to this response. It‚Äôs possible, it‚Äôs expensive, it‚Äôs mostly fun.

Yeah but how are you going to fit two 6380s on a narrow hanger without it looking shit. üòÇ

And wheel bite with 110mm wheels.

Buy a real monster GX4 from bajaboard or Bioboards, adapt ratio and wheels, renew your insurance and add a GTX sticker on the board.
Alternative, will be a trampa and change ratio, wheels...

But I am a greenhorn here with read only skills, so let confirmed and guru's assist you their advise should be much more better than mine.

You are yes. 

Baja or channel trucks at that speed will kill you.

Bioboard uses 3dservisas fixed gear ratios that are insanely fast but not that speed.

Nothing you suggested will work

Hi,
That's why, renew your insurance was the only good idea...

Before you spend a cent/penny i would find a nice long downhill smooth stretch, then pelt it down on full throttle. This way you'll find out whether you really fancy going 70kph+. You never know, might save you a few dollars.... üòÇ

You don‚Äôt want to go 70kph. 50kph is plenty honestly. 

I broke my ribs, shoulder socket and collarbone going 30kph when the board slipped away from under me and my gear was a half shell. Imagine what you could break going 70kph and falling without serious gear on.

Ouch ! Hope that healed OK.

I've had a couple of bails, but nothing too serious. Need to remember I'm not 20 anymore and don't bounce as well as i used to !

Putain!

Protections are not subsidiary gears...
I use to wear an impact vest when I am kitesurfing 15+ ft waves and reduce this limit to 6 ft when  the reef is less deep than 3 ft...
I have also to review my protection plan and my trainings

C'est rare de voir quelqu'un sortir "putain" ici!

At 70kph, the only thing you'd want to wear is a full leather motorbike suit with D3O pads.

[/quote]

They also ride much different than esk8ers.
Part of the narrow trucks is for control/leverage when sliding.  We don't have much need for sliding since we have brakes and Throttle control. 
Narrow trucks are also more forgiving if you over correct speed wobbles .

Yeah.... i wouldn't go 40mph on those trucks personally. 

If you really wanna go 70km, you're basically looking at a full makeover on that board. 
Nothing on pre built boards is intended for those speeds. Well maybe the bearings lol. Maybe

43 mph (Crazy!).... use the calculator. Change wheel/motor pulley ratio and change wheels. The closer the pulley ratio the better for top speed. Rise up the motor pulley teeth count, lower down the wheel pulley teeth count (example: 20T/33T). Still, what you desire is insane. Follow the previous forum members advice: Don't! :confused:

Fastest and cheapest way to hit that speed is to find a sufficiently tall building, ride board off roof of said building, and hope whoever packed your parachute knew what they were doing. Oh and don't forget the parachute. Probably safer than trying to take those DKP trucks up to that speed.

A evolve bearly even has enough torque to hit top speed on stock settings.. hehe

20/32 will have no torque at all, like others said, ride your board off off a rooftop with a parachute or stand on your board on a truck bed and tell the driver to hit 70mph
