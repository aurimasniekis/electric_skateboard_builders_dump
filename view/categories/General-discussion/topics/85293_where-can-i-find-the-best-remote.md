This are two articles covering your questions, what is best for me might not be best for you it depends on your preferences.  Some remotes have thumb control, some have trigger style control. Focbox Unity, Vesc 6, Ollin Vesc and some offerings from Flipsky are all decent choices. Take a look into the build section and search for 4WD drives to get a idea what others are using.
Behind the search icon is so much knowledge, make use of it!

IMO the best remote you can just purchase is the Hoyt Puck. I've got two of them. Basic features but tough as nails and really robust connection.

On the cheaper end, a LOT of people (myself included) like the mini remote.

On the expensive end, a lot of people like the hoyt. I have the maytech split trigger on the way. Waterproof and wireless charging. No negative reviews yet.
