Hey guys

I am going to Austria to snowboard / ski in a couple of weeks from now, and I was wondering if any of you had any ideas on how to make the trip more "electric". I have been thinking about bringing my fpv drone and airplane for some cool videos, but I am a bit nervous that I might crash them due to the LiPo batteries running dead faster in the cold wearher. 
I have also wondered if it would be possible to build an e-snowboard. I have seen that "The Hacksmith" on YouTube ([Watch here](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=TZUgiCahy_4) or below) has build one with some EDFs but it does not seem ideal. 
Any other ideas?

I just googled some more and found this thing. It looks awesome. I might try to build something similar. I wonder where I can find some of those tires though...

And this seems too complicated

Make a track that attaches to the bottom of your board that you can take off once you get to the top. No more waiting in chairlift lines!

Maybe some sort of paddle boat design would work?
