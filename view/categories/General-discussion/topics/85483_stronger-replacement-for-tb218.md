Hey all, Iâ€™ve just noticed that my rear wheels are starting to splay out, Iâ€™m guessing the axles  are starting to bend on my tb218s. ðŸ˜Ÿ. Itâ€™s a shame, they have been great till now but they obviously arenâ€™t strong enough for how Iâ€™m riding the board. Iâ€™m only 80kg with all my gear on so it must be the all terrain riding thatâ€™s killing them. 

I need an economical replacement option. I donâ€™t think I can go to 10mm axels with these wheels and I canâ€™t afford any extra parts. I can machine the motor mounts to fit whatever so they should be ok. 

I canâ€™t figure out which options I should choose in surfrodz to get the same width etc. 
The other option I was considering is @riverside.rider trucks... are they stronger? And whatâ€™s the width work out like?

Hereâ€™s my current setup... you canâ€™t see the bend due to the camera distortion.

Why can't you?

Surfrodz are 10mm
Haggy are quite a bit wider than tb218

I couldnâ€™t find bearings with a 10mm id that fit. I guess I could machine the wheels....

@torqueboards Is making a new batch with 30-40% stronger axles. So you might just wait for the new batch.. :slight_smile:

The bearings in the wheel are 8 x 24 x 8mm not standard size.... so Iâ€™d need 10 x 24 x 8â€™s

Most of what Iâ€™m up to is sub 30mph and I love to carve so Iâ€™m guessing tkp?

That's what I'd go with. I love both, but if you're not shooting for high speed and would rather carve tkp is the right choice.

@Boardnamics is currently working on mounts for tkp too.
Just be sure to get the hex hanger. 
You can buy thier axles but I've found it cheaper to buy shoulder bolts from other sources. 
@mmaner has a great surfrodz write up on here.

Maybe Put the front truck in the rear and buy a single extra wide longboard truck for the front to get you by?
I think @dickyho has some wide trucks he sells for his pneumatic kits. Maybe you can buy a front truck from him.

@amazingdave Send us an email we'll send you a replacement truck.

I'd check your belt tension too if your belt tension is too tight. I'd imagine it would cause more strain. Just a thought.

So strange cause I'm in the upper 130kg catagory and I've been using my set of TB 218mm trucks since November/December 2017 with dual 6374 and thousands of miles ridden on them and I have no bending of the axles.

I've only heard of a few TB218 axles bending. But next production run we upgraded the axles to be stronger to prevent any of these issues.

Yours in bending on the hanger itself or just on the steel axle that the wheel sits?

I think mine may be in the same path, I need to take a better look, but In the last few days it appears that the wheels are wearing more on the inside and coning
