Was lucky to have a ride on a Onda core board the otherday, surprisingly enjoyable ride.  I know farraday a promoting there 3d bits but i like the idea of the space cell battery,  do you think it would be easy to have a dual motor set up on this board.  Being plastic it appears to be very easy to modify?  Was thinking burying the space cell in the deck esc out front and motors at the rear of the back of the board.

It's doable. There were kits sold in the past. Many people on ES forums have made Onda setups.

Onda is an interesting beast. Especially the weird rowing action with the "oar". Should make a hella electric though.
