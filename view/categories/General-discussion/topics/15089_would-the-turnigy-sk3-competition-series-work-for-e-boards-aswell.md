Hi,
I was just wondering around and came across the Turnigy GliderDrive SK3 Competition Series - 3858 - 4.6 1120kv. It seems to be powerful, quite cheap and doesn't weight too much, but I don't know anything about it, so would it fit under a longboard and is it any good or just a potato?

It is 1120kv, that is waaaaaay to high for an electric longboard. Plus it only supports 3-4s lipo, and it only has a 5mm shaft which won't fit most pulleys. So no, I don't think this motor will work...

The direct gas replacement motors work however, like the Tacon 160 and the Turnigy 160. They are 245kv to 300kv so have fun

That's an interesting-looking motor, @Hillso . Kinda wonder why we've never seen it used in builds. It would seem to be a good candidate for a high-powered dual rear drive setup.

With 28 poles you are already at twice the erpm speed compared to a normal sk3 14 pole motor at the same rpm. And then it has a 240kv at 10S. So the calculation says 190kv * 42V * 14/2 poles = 55860 erpm compared to 240kv * 42V * 28/2 poles = 141120 Erpm. And the actual vesc shouldn't  be used at more than 60000 Erpm. 
Maybe VESC 6 could handle it but I think there will be other disadvantages.
