**Reverse DIY Esk8: Is It for you?**
Are you an extreme DIY builder or rider? Do the following apply to you?
* own more boards than dress pants (or have dress pants with diyt knee holes)
* have several cabinets in your house dedicated inherently toxic or dangerous items (i.e. lithium batteries, epoxy, high Amp power supplies, leaded solder/nickel)
* picked a late night skate over naked time with a special person
* wrecked your car because you were rushing to get home and meet up with your eskate crew
* caused at least 3 minor house fires that were build related
* patched/painted more than 5 drywall holes from runaway boards or accidental throttling

Yeah?! Are you itching for something new?! Then you, Sir or Ma‚Äôam, should try REVERSE DIY ESK8!

**What is ‚ÄúReverse DIY Esk8‚Äù?**
You‚Äôre probably thinking, ‚ÄúForward, No Reverse with Break‚Äù for Lyfe is tatted on my chest in Old English!  What are you, ... a Boostedboard owner?‚Äù No way Brochacho! Reverse DIY Esk8 is the process of deconstructing complete builds or commercial boards and using the components to creatively address the everyday needs of non-eskate, regular folk. This group includes:
* muggles
* rollerbladers
* vape bros
* bird scooter riders
* Security guards


**What do non-Esk8 people need/do/like?**
Generally, stuff that doesn‚Äôt matter or is borning AF. If your Mom nagged you about it, they love it. Stuff like:
* pushing all the time
* ironing clothes
* collecting furniture
* hosting dinner parties for her work friends that you give zero shits about
* reporting HOA violations
* obeying ‚Äúvoid if broken‚Äù stickers
* matching hand towels that are just for decoration
* extra cup holders
* satellite radio.

**My first build:  The Fight Club Narrator**
Here is the board starting off:

* Leave these unsupervised and go organize your knicknacks in the garage. You will be pleasantly suprised at your gadgets ability to warm your home, and maybe even your heart!

@Arzamenable I think we are more similar then you might think.

I use an old deck as a grinding/rolling station. 

Old bushings are unpredictable bouncy cat toys.

old drop deck, is a creeper for the garage

old 10s3p from a vanguard is a battery backup charging station, it charges once every 3 days, and is the home of all our usb charging.

speed controllers and old motors from vanguard are a beltsander

old wheels are inside a pcv pipe as a roller attachment for tables/sawhorses for loading wood. to a meiter saw/tablesaw/router/planer

ü§ò

It's a hot day and there is a power cut. But somehow my sweat drenched head has an idea. Ding! :bulb: I rush to find my tool box, grab my esk8 and my trusty cooling fan. And get to mad scientist mode. Screws flying, ducktapes ripping and bam, I have have a windmill. I stuck the rotor of the fan on my esk8's wheel and shoved it outside my apartment's window. The wind turns the fan and I have some  electricity :buzzzz.  Hue hue hue. Now time to get some cooling action. Time to turn on the faaaan. 
But, oh shit, oh nooo, 
there is no fan nomoo 
:sob:

@Sn4pz this what happens when we aren‚Äôt allowed out to skate! You hear that God!? Listening climate change deniers ?!

Snow in Vegas, Hawaii, LA, hail in San Diego. Weather plus Chinese New Year slowing production and delivery is a recipe for restlessness. 

@Deckoz haha, not a knock on Mcgivering things and being resourceful. Just frustrated that I have 5-7 builds that I can‚Äôt seem to finish. At least I can knock out a tear down of a wacky board and try to be clever out loud.

Who are you? Me?

I need to stop building batteries for my dumbass friends.

I literally have parts for a kaly gear carver just sitting in a pile right now. It kills me. 

Also I keep my 30Qs in those Ikea steel mesh bins, loose and at full charge.
