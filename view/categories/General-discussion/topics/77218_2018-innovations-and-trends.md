At nearly the end of the year I can see everywhere some kind of reviews and summaries of the past year.

Tell us here, what was your big innovations or trend for the year 2018?

As for me I would start with

- Gear drive for all kind of boards and trucks
- ESCape 
- we need bigger motors (mainstreem of the 6384 size)
- geiz ist geil .... we want everything as cheap as possible (what gave also Flipsky a big push with there ESCs and other stuff)

if some of the things where a thing already the year before, than please be kind, it´s my first year in this forum ;) pleas just correct me...

and sorry @onloop your unity is not in our top inovations for 2018 as there are not shipped yet or only in process of shipping. 
For now the unity takes the first place as top inovation for 2019... let´s see if it can beat that place up till the end of next year! :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

80mm motors please, 63xx just isn't cutting it. And also, RELIABLE motors that doesn't have loose magnets or retainer ring issues every 500 miles

Just realized this isn't a want list, its a trend list :upside_down_face:
Flipskys and 13s boards thanks to @Deckoz

One thing I think was big this year were the  intorduction of great direct drives and hub motors like @Hummie's new v4's, @torqueboards's  direct drive and @boostedbuilder's direct drive to name a few. And although the direct drives have not shipped yet they are great strides in the right direction and as long as there are no lawsuits for adding heat dissipation grooves lol they will be great for the community.

In 2017 the masses (lol) were still afraid of using FOC and 12s. 

Now everyone (well, almost everyone) uses FOC and 12s is soooo mainstream.

4wd is definitely a trend. 

In 2017 dual 6374 was considered a beast. Now that's standard, and only bigger motors or 4x6374 raises a few eyebrows.

there are no this motors...not yet, or as min not affordable for everybody.
that´s why i take apart every of my motors and add some personal note like sealing the sensors, glueing the magnets, change the bearings etc.

The trend of the year has to be surfrodz trucks

I vote for 16s ESCs and everybody will need that for sure as we all want to go faster....:roll_eyes: not sure thou if that´s gonna be a good thing!
It will rise up over 2019 and in 2020 everybody will come back to easy builds with motors which not toally oversized for what they should be used and batteries with endless range but small size factor.

I very much want and wish to see more Esk8 events all over the world in 2019 ( @Michaelinvegas @LazyRolling @okp )    
I also hope our eboards will get a more legal status in the countries where it´s restricted or still a grey zone.

This. I foresee 4 months of insane OP builds and then everyone doing a little light runner for going to the shops over summer.

I think the biggest trend this year was great Lacroix builds and the uptake of precision trucks by a lot of builders and vendors.

More decks built for us. 
And PLEASE some kick surfrodz in the a$$ and make more adjustable baseplates. 
Or @Kug3lis get them made already i don't care.  Do want.

For me a big trend was the introduction of the new type of 120mm wheels by @MoeStooge with his rubberized street (50mm wide) and Race (63mm wide) versions. Setting the pace for the introduction of custom rubber wheels into Esk8boarding as a third option for urethane wheels and pneumatic tires.

Well obviously is not a trend for you 'buddy'. Since this is a tread where they are asking for opinions, this is mine then. If you feel embarrassed, speak for yourself. I don't see @Andy87, @Riako or @Skunk feeling like that for praising @MoeStooge's wheel developments. Admiring someone elses work here is hardly 'climbing on his ass'. I suggest you chill out and calm your anger. :wink:

Almost like you Andy, for me it's :

* Fkn silent helical gear system by Jenso, since geare drive are so 2016 now (lol, also the [5:1 ratio in a mini shape](https://www.e-toxx-shop.com/mbs/mini-gear-box-drive-mbs/1-5-helical-gear-box/#cc-m-product-10006747170))
* Bergmeister 145mm pneumatic wheel, gorgeously made by Haggy (also air wheels on longboard setup, and in general solid full alloy CNC rims)
* Dual ESCape in one heatsink case!
* [Elastomere Damper Upgrade](https://www.e-toxx-shop.com//app/module/webproduct/goto/m/m66d7cf161189c561) for channel type trucks
* Safe self-tensioning system (don't know how to call it, like Haggy motor mount, or like ElectricBoardKorea)

For me also, it's AWD (that I would test in a light eMTBoard setup at the beginning of 2k18, but then switch for a MAD Surfer... that I couldn't make cause of the 4.20 esc and finally a change again my plans, but I will do it !).

For 2019 : 
We want dual VESC6 like 200A continue, like @ARetardedPillow 8080 enclosed sensored 10mm shaft (like the APS 8072 but realiable), more MTBoard stuff ! Mudgard, good new trucks, rims, strong trucks, GearDrive, awesome trucks, dampers innovation/spring, reliable trucks,1kW battery pack smaller and lighter...etc
More events for sure ! (WheelGames 2018 waas so cool !!!)

Sorry, french translate barrier ... it's always hard to understand properly when it goes on in fun.
But I think I get it ^^ Brent you are teasing a bit right ? (as usual no ?) 
Don't say the same about me and Timo, I just like the amasing work and products  :smile:
I'm currius about how this rubber wheel feels :P

2. Esk8 renegade weekend

I see it as this year of being the year of ESC's (ESCape, Focbox Unity, Flipsky, Maytech, Diyeboard) and crediting the next year as being the year of drive trains (probably DD if TB and Carvon's works out OK). 

I don't see gear drives going down until someone comes in and does mass production. Cost going down isn't coming from anyone who isn't a ManuVendor.

Colorado Rocky Mountain track race
Redmond Derby days race
Centennial Trail race
Evolve world cup
Renegade
My hopes and aspirations for 2019 start with venues like the Barret Junction UpHill.
Piggybacking on DH events as a supporting class for DH racing makes sense. Would like to see more kart Track and BMX races as well. Parking lot Outlaw racing can be done for zero cost and is just as fun.

As a programmer, I've learned how important it is to name things accurately.  It saves so much work and effort and money later.

In *this specific case*, how'd you like if 2 years from now every single switch is labeled "Push to Start" because the cheap China clones know that's what English words sell shit.  Well, there's nothing you can do if it then arrives in the mail and it's a "push to start" -- you know, you push a button and it starts.  Because if you search for "[push to start](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=push+to+start&t=canonical&iax=images&ia=images)" it's universally known that means pushing a button.

"Roll to start" is unambiguous.

He was designing the esk8 for years and now but he keeps mentioning how he's talking to the persion who's making the whole thing.
It will be totally different from the others like a true original that's not right off diyeboards shelf :man_facepalming:

But you push a skateboard. 

And this switch makes the skateboard turn on when you push it.

So.. it's completely logical right?

I actually talked to him on Instagram and he insisted that he designed everything from the ground up... I even sent him the link  :smile: 
And the saddest thing is that there are people out there who actually buy those boards and think they got a good deal....

Yeah -- until you have no way to know if a switch does that, or doesn't do that, because of namespace pollution.

Whatever, do whatever you want, I don't give a shit.

You can also call shoes and gloves both "limb protectors" but you wouldn't want them all labeled that way, would you?  Because then shopping for one is much more difficult.

Well if you price up the parts, as inferior as they are, and consider that there's at least some customer support and QC that went into them before they were shipped, it actually isn't a "bad deal".

It's still a shit board but its not a bad deal in the grand scheme of things :smiley:

Yes and no... I actually don't think that there is a "new" QC in comparison that diyeboard already had. I think the boards get produced at the same factory with the same qc.. :slight_smile:

To be fair, I legit think the push / kick push /roll to start switch is a cool innovation. Maybe we should name it hands free switch. Still 3 syllables!

The problem is just that they really often burn out in last time.
I have two laying at home and wanted to use them in my next build. 
After all I have seen I will probably stick with an easy old school loop key.
Don’t need another burned down board.

There's only one way to end this debate @neiru37 @b264  
[poll type=regular public=true]

2019 for ATB will mean 9” wheels, 4wd, basically @Duffman circa 2017 for the masses

Otherwise yeah gear drives, hub motors, commercial planetary gear drives, electrowizardry and esk8 law enforcement or repeal
