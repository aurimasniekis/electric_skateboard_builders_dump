Instead of the car esc, get a VESC either from @Chaka (ollinboardcompany.com) or @onloop (enertionboards.com).

Those wheels you are looking at look really marked up for ABEC clones.

I was wondering about that but his esc looks so easy to programme (first board) can you use the same programme card to change all the settings on a vesc?? @ra.rend

They are more expensive but because he has free shipping the ones on ebay turn out to be more with shipping to NZ

You change settings on the vesc with a computer. Too many options for a programming card.

All you really need to do with the vesc is to do a motor detection (he has a tutorial for motor detection https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSBX0dyq-oU) then change some settings. Since you're using a space cell, @onloop recommends you use these settings http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/vesc-faq-optimized-s-p-a-c-e-cell-settings/414. Btw I'm new to esk8 building as well, and have never done this since my vesc has'n arrived yet (I ordered mine last month).
