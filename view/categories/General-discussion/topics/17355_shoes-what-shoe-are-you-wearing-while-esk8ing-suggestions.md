Actually I'm glad you brought that up I was thinking about getting different shoes that would cover my ankles or maybe just ankle braces or something that would cover my ankles even though I don't need ankle braces -  it's always my ankles though

I wear Birkenstock's 80% of the time. I know its dumb and I have lost some toe skin from it. Hey least I wear a helmet and gloves. 
The other 20% of the time I wear some vans skateshoes but they are not a comfy as the birks, the sole it a bit thin and if you take long rides it can become a tad uncomfortable.

I use an old pair of running shoes.  I'd never use these shoes if they were brand new.  But the sole is made out of a sweet cushion that absorbs a lot of vibration.  But, I'm really liking the pair @JohnnyMeduse suggested :sunglasses:

I just started skating these DC Evans and they feel incredible!  The soles make them super comfy and the flat base feels great on the board.

These Adidas SB Matchcourts are similar and probably more rugged with coated toes and more serious soles.  Probably not enough Street cred for the keel kids, would have to checkin with @Michaelinvegas lol, but worth trying.

they dust off easily and provide a ton of cusion and comfort without totally eliminating the feel of the road. 

or barefoot. I eskate barefoot a lot. probably way too much, but i really like it.

Tried the Adrain Lopez and it was very comfy. In fact the Lakai I own are much harder on my feet. Riding 6 miles on my lou killed my feet in lakais.Barely felt it in the Adrian Lopez. 

Big difference: Adrian Lopez lasted about two weeks. I don‚Äôt even foot brake. Just leaning on the board pried off the entire rubber.

Lakai are still solid.
