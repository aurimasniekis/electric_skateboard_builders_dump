I went out for a ride under the sun today. The temperature is nice so it was plenty of people everywhere. Slow ride today, no problem.
I was on pavement and reached a crowded area. A mob of kids just out of school. I stopped my board, grabbed it and walked through them. All of a sudden a small group set aside started yelling at me:
Coward!!
Look at that pussy...wearing a helmet lol.
He even has to walk through us. What a looser.
You suck!
 All that gear for 5kmh mwahaha
Pathetic motherf ..... Etc...
I could be their father,maybe their grandpa so i couldn't care less about teenager shit. Resumed my relaxing stroll happily and made It to my home.
Now those kids came back to my mind and i thought....what would a kid have done? Or an easily influenced dude?
There's a thin line between brave and stupid.
Do not cross that line. Gear up. Use your brain and ride safe. Do not let bullies push you to the reckless ways. Just do the right thing.
Cheers

Interesting topic! Ofc you should use a helmet and even better, a full set of protection gear. I wouldn't listen to the kids even if I feel a bit stupid at times walking around with a helmet on. When they see me later surfing a longboard at 50kph on the pavement, they will understand :joy: Either way, if you're just riding at like 10-20 kph a helmet can save your life so don't be stupid and gear up!

I feel you. Some people i know would have jumped on the board and run away wide open throttle.  Maybe tomorrow they forget the helmet at home and ride faster than common sense dictates. Just to look cool. We are slaves of the like and that drags people to stupidity.

I've had something like this happen, I used it as a teaching moment -- it went something like this:

"what a wuss" -teen

me "hey man, check this out" lifting sleeve to show scars.

"that was the road-rash through a 200$ leather jacket, imagine the skin grafts I would've gotten without the jacket"

teen "maybe you shouldn't've wrecked"

Me "sure buddy, your choice wuss or road pizza -- I'll go with wuss. have a day"

Obviously I'll never get through a kids bravado in front of his friends but the idea is planted

Cause lets face it teenagers are dicks but apparently it is frowned upon to a grown man to throat punch a minor when they are being an asshole.  Next time just ride right around them and if they say anything just ride pass flipping them the bird.  I dont wear a helmet when I ride a push board but I do on my electric board because you are going to be able to go alot faster on flat land on an electric board.  Always better to be safe than sorry.

Plus you could wear something like this ![image|340x340](upload://4oorDID9TFOC1XQwg9TJMVfo2w.jpeg)

 Very unfortunate, as I feel some do deserve to be "humbled" at times.  :joy:

Until recently, I had never used a helmet. Of course, I didn't do anything to necessitate head protection. I started to get into boarding, and I now make sure that I have one, especially after reading about some of the mishaps to people who have been doing it for most of their life!

It makes me wonder where their parents are and what their opinions on the idea would be...

Disrespectful kids should receive some education man, how come teenagers feel insecure enough to try look better by badmouthing other people and specially adults?

Give them the fucks and later when they start working, pay bills and are able to afford a board with their own money & not with dad or mommy's earnings... Even then they should still learn to shut the fuck up.

A friend of mine on a super cheap hub board from aliexpress with zero power managed to crack his helmet in half down the back from a stand still. He had his foot on it, was talking and accidentally pushed the trigger on his mini remote, it shot out and he fell backwards into a sign post pole. No helmet and he would have been lucky to survive.

Skating is the least of our worries on esk8. It's the other things, remote mistakes, electrical failures, motors lock ups, esc flutters, battery sag, loss of traction on leaves, other people being unpredictable and a myriad of other issues that you don't experience on an analogue skateboard.

It annoys me when people say "oh I can't get hurt because I'm only cruising at under 20mph". If you ride your head into the floor at 18mph you will die, it's not rocket science.

Hmm, in my area i have not gotten remarks like that before. Instead those who see my board when i'm public transport or am chilling at an outdoor eatery would compliment my helmet and all. Wearing my TSG pass, children and teens would say the gnarliest things like 'woah spaceman' or 'power ranger'. 

All in all, wear as much protection as you see fit, and screw those kids. Not literally.

Sounds like just kids commenting on something they don't know anything about (or just don't know enough about). They don't see themselves as vulnerable, they see themselves as invincible, never falling down, riding out from every situation without a scratch and looking hella cool at the same time if it was them on your board...

You on the other hand as an older and more experienced person understand the risks associated with eBoarding, understand/know the limits of your riding skills and understand that sometimes stuff happens that is too unexpected or even completely out of your control. And you prepare for that.

You know through experience. They think they know through surface look.

btw, ever looked at a professional making anything they do look super easy? You then go out to try to do the same thing only to discover that "Oh, this ain't as easy as it looks"

Getting violent is not gonna do anything good, even though it might feel good at that moment. It's just unnecessary escalation.

"Dude, maybe if you had worn a helmet your face wouldn't be so messed up."  Should shut him up.  He'll get laughed at by his friends cause the old guy one upped him.

The funny thing is that if that had been a group ride with everyone wearing helmets they might have thought "awesome!" instead, though they'd never admit it out loud. 
They'd see a bunch of badasses riding together in full armor, and because you had to slow down they'd get a good long look at your sweet rides!

As a teen myself who never rides without a helmet and takes safety seriously I've gotten a couple "helmets are lame" comments from my friends (one of which had a longboard accident without any protection didn't hit his head thankfully but had some good road rash and I laughed at him for it) but it doesn't bother me too much. After seeing the session error video I decided that no matter what people thought of me I would gear up for every ride. On a more positive note I was messing around with my board in an elementary school parking lot this weekend and a groups of little kids aproached me and started asking some questions about my board and one of them said "I like your helmet it's really cool looking" and that made me feel good and have some hope in the future teens

I would have approached them... I've done things like this before. 

*Walks up to kids*
"Hey guys, check this out. This board can push me up to 50mph if I want. Have you guys ever had a car run a stop sign in front of you going that fast? It's happened to me, I'm here partly thanks to my helmet and other safety gear."

"I've got a wife and daughter. It would be devastating to them if I were to die in a situation like that one I just mentioned. I'll do anything I can to make sure I can keep living. At least 3 times in the last 25 years of skating, my helmet has literally kept me alive three times. Three times doesn't sound a lot, but that's at least three deaths I didn't have."

"If you guys decide one day to ride a skateboard, think for yourself- how much does living, or not becoming a retard who hit their head and can't talk or walk anymore mean to you?"

"This shits fun as fuck and it can only be fun when your alive. Take it easy guys."

I would just smile and say "don't be jelly kiddos. Maybe your mommy and daddy can buy you one too. K thx bye!" Then give them the old school "shocker" hand gesture. Keep it positive and take their criticisms as compliments. 

Or if you want to be more sassy about the helmet comments, say "OMG, that's what your mom said before she dropped you on your head as a baby. Your mom tells me EVERYTHING. _**or**_ Your mom yells out all kinds of things during sex. " Then wink and smile at them.

I would have chosen the more educational way : i'll ask one of them to ride the board but I have the controller, and I'll either start abruptly (falling backwards) or normal starts but getting more and more speed
At more than 40, everybody would like a little protection at least

Derek.... He was a healthy fit giant of a man, knew how to ride and surf. Usually wears a helmet except that one sad day he decided to test out a new build and didn't bring it out with him. RIP @BigBoyToys Miss riding with you.

When I was a teenage, I didn't wear a helmet biking until a cop pulled me over and told me it was a law for people under 18 to have helmets. I HATED wearing that thing and took it off whenever I could. Skateboarding is another problem. I never wore a helmet doing that either because there was very little risk going at 3 mph attempting tricks as a n00b, I knew how to roll off that kinda of fall. The problem is that this is what these teenage think esk8 is, potentially flying off your board at 15-30+ mph doesn't mean you can react in the same manner. 

I went snowboarding wearing a beany 10 years ago or so, just slowly going down the bunny slope, eventually got more comfortable and started carving. Next thing you know I was on my back and blacked out for a bit. When I came to, I looked up and wasn't able to move for like 20 seconds. Pretty sure it was a concussion. 

Sadly there isn't much you can do with these "cool" kids. It's their life lesson to eventually learn. Most of us need our heads and body intact in order to make an income for this stuff, so the more protected we are, the longer we can enjoy this.

There's no lesson learned in most of the examples we give or cook up.  When someone dies, or becomes paralyzed whatever they may or may not learn is useless.

The hope of someone "learning a lesson" this way is futile.

So here is my more serious reply.  There was a Project Manager at my biggest supplier of composite assemblies in Salt Lake City.  Good guy to work with.  Energetic.  Knew his stuff.  Liked rock climbing. 
 Apparently he didn't like wearing a helmet.  The brain damage he suffered was in the region that dominates speech.  He tried to come back to work about six months later but he couldn't say a word without stuttering it five times.  He didn't work for long.  It was just too frustrating.  Imagine that, with all your thoughts intact, but you can't say them to anyone.  I put the helmet on before I turn the board on.

My SO is pretty against helmets just because she grew up not wearing one on dirt bikes, motorcycles, and ATV's. So bikes and skateboards with helmets would be right out the window.

I was raised in the streets, I probably was one of those kids. Now I am the grandpa, I don't wear protective gear because I'm older, I wear it because I'm smarter. I'm also Sensei Joe, a Karate teacher that focuses on self defense using your mind not your fist. So I also wear a helmet to set an example. We must wear a helmet, things do happen to the best of us. 
Those kids were most likely influenced by one loud mouth and the others just followed in. You do the right thing, keep on doing the right thing. In the same way that many might think you silly, just as many will see you as wise. Thanks

I hate those skaters. Bikers have more reasonable excuse calling us cheaters and lazy, but kick pushers are ridiculous. Majority of them are in a parking lot doing tricks and just going back and forth within a short distance. I'm riding 10 miles! If they had to kick that they would get a car, thus, cheating!

To me I think it's all a different sport (in no particular order): 
1. surfboarding,
2. longboarding,
3. Skateboarding,
4. Snowboarding,
5. Wakeboarding,
6. E-boarding,
7. Whatever I'm missing

Thing is each one is similar but very, very different. None of these is lazy, getting out and being active is all it's about. But E-boarding is a different machine..... Sure I can have fun at home on my Switch. Riding my motorcycle around Hyrule Castle, dodging mechanical spiders with lazers, but nothing is as satisfying doing 30mph on your own ultrabeast. Built yourself and strapped or loosely griped between your feet and gravel on 4wheels. Feed and full by the copper blood that seeps from the 3 holes coming from the vains of some wall, into the tank and off a cliff we go! That's why I E-Board. "Where a helmet"

It's rare to see a trick skater with safety equipment on unless it's at an event but rare to see down hill longboarders with out at least a helmet even when just riding solo. There is a reason for that, head injuries at downhill speeds will kill and we ride at downhill speeds.
