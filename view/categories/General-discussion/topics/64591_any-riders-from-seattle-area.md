I was recently in San Diego and joined the SoCal telegram group. I loved the idea and seeing people constantly joining each other on rides and such. Iâ€™ve decided to start a group for Seattle area riders. Follow this link to join group. https://t.me/joinchat/JIW7lkq_zHPPNOZ8RRgexw

There's a couple of groups in the Seattle area.

PNW eSk8 Collective (FB)
Seattle eSk8 Group (Meetup)

I think there's another one that is city-centric but i can't find it right now
