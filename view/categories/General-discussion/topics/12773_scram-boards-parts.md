dunno which parts you talk about.. but a few topics back there was a guy who built mountainboard out of scram boards kit / mounts..

I dunno why they dont market themselves more.. seems like they got quite ok stuff.. the promotion and advertising is not strong enough I assume :slight_smile:

also, they're in uk, so no idea about shipping costs to other countries..
