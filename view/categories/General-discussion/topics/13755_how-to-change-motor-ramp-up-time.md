I'm using an RC car remote control using the PPM setting in the VESC. There is no "ramping time constant" on PPM settings. Is there anything similar to this? Only thing I have changed is the "Speed limit ramp step" in the advance tab under motor configuration.I'm assuming this is similiar to ramping time constant. Default value is 0.00050. Change value is now 4.50000.

there is no way to change this currently. pull your throttle less/slower.

changing advanced parameters is not recommended unless you are trying to fry your vesc/drv/motor/face....:head_bandage:
