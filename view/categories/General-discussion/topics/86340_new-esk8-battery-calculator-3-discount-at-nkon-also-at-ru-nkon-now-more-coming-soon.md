Hey guys,


I just wanted to create a new thread about my recently created web application which is a esk8 battery calculator.

https://esk8-calculators.com

It is a calculator for people who want to buy a new battery pack or check what the vesc settings should be acording to the batteries spec sheet.

You can also calculate the price per kilometer and see how much discharge a battary pack would have.

Feel free to ask any questions. The price calculations are EU based.

I've also reached out to Nkon who is willing to offer 3% discount to my calculator users :D!


Best regards,
Menno

Recommendation please use Mooch's guidelines battery capabilities

since 30q can do 20a and 40T isn't good at 35a

I don't think that's enough at all for a board to be fun. You need at least 100A and that can be easily acoomplished with a 12s3p of 30Ts, 36 cells instead of 60 huge ass 20800.

While capacity looks outstanding I'm the kind of rider addicted to acceleration

Forget it. Molicel's P42A is the better cell than the 40T. But costs start at $12.99 per cell and decreases with larger volumes.

Compared to the 40T. Mooch rates it at 30 amps.

Yes saw the Molicel review good pointer, that was my first choice, fogstar wholsale have them, nkon do not.

But these high discharge cells with 4Ah capacity are mighty expensive. 40T is definitely there as well, I want 4Ah capacity for some range - ATB, so 30T is not in scope, 30T looks like a great cell for a punchy smaller pack.

The Sanyo NCR20700B  was first choice just for it's current sale price/capacity and reputation as a solid cell.  Of course not a discharge queen like the 40T and the Molicell P42A, however the NCR20700B  real discharge rate is more like 15A, same as the 30Q. Nobody complains about the discharge power of a 12s5p 30Q pack?

**Source Mooch:** _I am rating this cell at 16A 4000mAh. It runs a few degrees hotter than the HG2 (which is why the Sanyo has a lower rating) but at 10A and 20A continuous down to 3.2V the Sanyo lasts about 25% longer._

Also see what Mooch has to say about the 40T claims to be 35A discharge:
 _In my opinion though it is not a 35A battery, as rated in the datasheet._

_At 35A continuous this cell reaches almost 90Â°C. That is too hot to ensure decent cycle life. A rating of 25A continuous brings it to about the same temperature that the Samsung 30T reaches at its rating._
- - - - - - - - - - - 
**Choices**

1) 12S**5P** of NCR20700B (**60 cells**)  = â‚¬268. Extra weight/capacity from extra P but still cannot compete with high discharge rates of Sammy/Mollicel. Not too bothered about weight it is going to be a heavy ATB build for running the beach.

But much, much cheaper and the extra P should go some way towards helping discharge as well as range.

For the high discharge cells, in 12S**4**P config (**48 cells**)

2) Samsung 40T = â‚¬347
3) Molicell P42A = â‚¬380

I get your point though @Eboosted & thanks for it, a dual setup with an exciting battery  could have about 70A for each ESC. 

- - - - - - - - -

Taking this to  @Kug3lis's calculator for details just to see what was be the net effect and to enter more accurate discharge rates. I would have to agreed that NCR20700B can not give a pair of 6384 motors the juice they need to hit absolute full power. 

Exciting? debatable for sure

I'm going to take this all with a big pinch of Epsom salts 

The peak discharge is an arguable point in any event. You can set a battery max for sure which will instruct the ESC not to draw more amps then you set, but that is a limiting factor of your config not the pack. 

If you set it to the peak discharge rate then the ESC will pull more than is rated for **_continuous_** discharge. In essence I could allow the ESC to pull more than the NCR20700B is rated for continuously but who runs at max throttle continuously? Burst mode will be fine at the expense of range
