See, I just tried 'like' that post and couldn't.  I think it was worthy of a little digital heart. I think it's Trampas fault 😀.

Your right, but the little like button is just soooooo handy.  I am saying, I like your comment but I have nothing useful to say so here is a valuless digital point 😀

I wonder if you can change the heart icon to another emoticon...

like :beer: ? 

Then again that would mean you have now run out of beer :thinking:
likely a more scary proposition

You only get 50 likes per day...

Just like this satire they slowly expire..

Why is this even a rule anyways? To prevent like spams? :kissing_heart:

Nah just a default number in the forum software that is configurable and likely never changed...

@mmaner you've just got too much love in your heart! Standard Discourse implementation allows each user 20 likes in a 24-hour period, presumably to eliminate the risk of people writing scripts to go all like-happy on a forum. Looking into it...

UPDATE: Our forum is set to 50 likes per user per day.

Now I'm all worried about my likes. I thought i had a unlimited fountain of likes to give away. Now that I'm aware of the possible lack, i feel compelled to save them. So...c-c-cold....
