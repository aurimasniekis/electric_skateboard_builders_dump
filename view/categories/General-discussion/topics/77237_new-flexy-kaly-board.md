With eSkating (@fottaz)  and some other coming in the mountainboard deck dedicated to esk8, we will finally have some choice! That is super nice !!

This Kaly shape looks pretty aggressive :smiling_imp:
@Kaly , amazing work made, it's crazy ! Is it your hanger right ? Base plate too ?
could we imagine the setting of trucks from below (like matrix 2) and release the top (for those who might want to use this deck in emtb) ?

(I love the Prototypo LaCroix too, but I'm a top mount battery pack guy :sweat_smile: :zipper_mouth_face:)

I can see a rendering showing a deck that has pretty much the same shape like the original Holy Pro. Look at the nose... I take the compliments for the shape! Designed back in 2010... 

A Trampa deck is more than the shape. Unlike other fiber materials, it is made from a special raw material that we produce ourselves. We weave it to special patterns, layer up different weave patterns to get the characteristic Trampa deck performance.
Our material can take all the impacts and doesn't split like regular carbon material plus has the flex properties that make our decks so special. We stock hundreds of decks in all flex ratings to assure that you get what suits your ride style, weight, shape requirements....

Take the long 35 and cut/drill it at your need maybe ...;)

Personally, This didn't look like a Trampa for sure! And when I write about the gorgeous aggressive shape of the Flexy Kaly Board, it is about the large spatula and the (maybe) concave.
The trampa arc shape is definitely an atypical type of ride... 
Also, about the nose, all the future emtb deck will have wheel-flare, or like longboard the cut-out shape style. Needed to let wheel driver clearance and more commonly in future Geared Drive. (That was an issue with MBS rounded tip deck)

My 35 long was run over by a truck and survived without damage.

It's also stiff enough, 17 Ply. Flexy deck won't do at my height and weight. 

Good to have alternatives, but this does not replace a good 17 PLY. Personal preference. Not sure what the bashing is about. You are not vendor locked when buying a trampa deck.

Jesus, so much vitriol in this thread.

I for one think that the landyatchz evo 39 and the trampa hs11/holypro are two of the best looking decks every made.

No offence to this kaly in the OP but it doesn't have the grace of a trampa. And the hubs have no aesthetic design complexities either. There is no layering. Very flat. Seems like it is designed by a 1st year design student in college. Its too sharp and not balanced at all. Kinda when amateur photographers overdo the sharpening in photoshop. You have to know when to stop.

Anyone with an eye for design will tell you that a trampa replacement, this is certainly not. 

Having said all that, good on kaly for trying to do his own thing. Maybe version 2 will be aesthetically more pleasing and balanced.

After reading this thread again, I donâ€™t think anyone was bashing on trampa for once. They were merely celebrating the fact that there would be an alternative to the trampa decks. @trampa did start comparing the deck to one of theirs with his usual passive aggresive condescending tone. I donâ€™t usually post this kind of stuff, but this is fucked up, I only once saw @kaly post something vaguely negative about Frank (not the trampa brand) so it is unfair to come to this thread an belittle what he is trying to accomplish. 

I think the design is so similar because kaly had been developing parts specifically to fit trampa boards and in the process probably helping sell hundreds of complete boards.

Maybe you need a closer look. 

This are not just plain design and certainly far from just photoshop, depth will be highlighted once dirty as it should be, not just for show. 

On the technical side wonâ€™t go in. 

Will leave this here just for you, no need to REPLY :-) 
when it comes to design everyone has their opinion.

'Frank is going to lose his shit over this' and 'Iâ€™m so ready' and 'pretty cool stuff here you might want to take a look at it', both were very clear shots at trampa at the beginning of this thread and were designed to get a raise from trampa which is exactly what happened.  

Why can't people just be pleased for extra options instead of constantly feeling the need to take sides by bashing other vendors? competition is great for the industry and help to drive prices down, aswell obviously giving people more choice!

Hi 

The system comes with motors and only work on channel trucks. Also no need to order any other parts from another vendor since Iâ€™ll be offering complete truck system, 100% CNC made precision trucks greatly improve. 

The system by default comes with a 10 mm axle that is compatible with the SKF double row bearings use in my hub. 

Also I will have an option to match the axle for the customer that already have superstar hubs. 

@topcloud thanks for the help.

This board should have been called Obama! Because Obama is way more cool than Trumpa ;)

DIME! You know your work is quality and @trampa is here to try and take credit. You put your time and money into that R&D. What you showed me today for the other board had me mind blown. Hablamos next week when I head back up!
