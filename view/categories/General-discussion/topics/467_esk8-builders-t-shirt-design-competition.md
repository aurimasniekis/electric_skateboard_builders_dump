Over the last few years the 'build your own eboard movement' has grown from strength to strength - Building your own eboard is a growing trend worldwide and it's not slowing down, everyday more & more people are experiencing the huge sense of fulfillment & performance benefits of building DIY Electric Skateboards.

As the numbers of eboard builders grows worldwide i think it's time we all had shirt we can proudly wear that expresses who we are & what we do.

**COMPETITION GUIDELINES**
1. Design a Graphical Logo to be printed onto a shirt.
2. The Logo should include text / shapes / patterns. 
3. The Design should be monochromatic. Black *Or* White is generally best. 
4. Ultimately you are designing a T-shirt & Logo, so think about how you make use of the front & back of the t-shirt.
5. The ideal design would consist of a LOGO & A SLOGAN - The slogan doesn't necessarily need to be incorporated into the logo it can be a stylised text. Maybe you will have logo on front & text on the back or vice versa.
6. The Design must incorporate a text element expressing the "message of our movement" a kind of catch phrase/slogan that concisely identifies what we do as eboard builders.


> **Message Examples;** 
> "I build eboards"
> "esk8 builder"
> "life's too short to push"
> "esk8 or die"
> "electric skateboard artist"

***TIP:*** For anyone that is not experienced in the field of graphic design you can still enter a quality shirt design *(like the one I posted below)* by making use of online design software such as this one provided by CustomInk.com
[T-SHIRT DESIGN SOFTWARE][1]

**HOW TO ENTER & WIN**
1. Design a shirt and post the pictures, front & back, into this thread. 
2. You may enter up to three different designs. 
3. Each design must be entered into a unique post onto this thread so it can be " :heart: " (liked)
4. Forum members vote for the designs they like by clicking the :heart:
5. The design with the most likes wins.

**WHAT DO I WIN**
1. The designer of the winning shirt gets one of the new **Enertion Wood & Carbon Fiber Decks - with built-in carbon fiber components enclosure.**
2. The first 20 entrants to the competition will get a free shirt with the winning design printed on it.

As an example: here is my first entry into the competition, I designed this using the online t-shirt design tool that I linked above.

The goal of my design was a minimalistic and clean look, so I only added one photo and line of text. So far I really like the designs that have come in. Thanks for the contest Onloop!

That could happen, but i tend to think there will be 2 or 3 designs that are naturally more popular and naturally get more votes than others...  but it all depends on how many people we get voting... the more people voting the better.

Also note, you can only like a post once, so at least people can't vote multiple times for one design... You can also unlike posts as well... so you can retract your vote and give it to another design.

So far i have liked a few. its great to see everyones different styles & ideas!

I didn't intend the grey. It is a result from the photo of my drawing.

colours are harder/ more expensive to get printed... 

Black or white logo is much better / cheaper / easier / 

the shirt can be any colour

hi @onloop

I know that the competition rules said that I could only submit 3 designs, is there any possibilities that I could change a little bit of one of my previous design? but I could feel like it's a bit cheating. hahaha.

thanks :smile:

You can delete your design and submit a new one

Also be warned, you have got lots of votes from people that don't contribute to this community, they are all new members and they don't have posts in any discussions. Unless they start actively participating their votes will be ignored.

The purpose for the voting mechanism is so that active members can have a say in the shirt design that may/will ultimately become a banner/flag they can proudly wear.

Trying to game the system won't work! so if these are friends you have invited to join our community & also vote for you that is great, but if they don't contribute they can't vote either.

```
to be honest, @onloop, I think part of th problem with less people voting is that this thread is above the "standard info threads" on the forum.. 
like all the other pinned posts are below it, seperating it from the main section where everybody is looking- once you read the pinned posts up top, you kinda overlook them. Even I didn't notice the t-shirt desing thread at first hanging out up there.

Also, if there was a way to bold the title or make it super eye catching, I think it would help **a ton**.

just my 2 cents :wink:

ya, It seems kinda sketchy that 7 or 8 people joined the forums on the same two days, and voted for **both** of @nik's designs... besides that, they haven't actually done anything "active" on the forums...

**EDIT:** I just looked a little deeper, and 9 "people" joined the forums around the same time, and all they did was vote for his designs (each person voted for all 3); none of them have done anything since.

smells kinda fishy to be honest... :confused:

Yeah I saw this a few days ago and messaged one of these account s asking if they existed and I haven't gotten a reply. Anyway we should just try to keep the focus on finding a great design for a new T-shirt for us to wear showing who we are when we're not riding our eskates :wink:.

OK, I think it's time to start getting down to the nitty gritty....

HERE ARE THE TOP 3 SHIRT DESIGN BASED ON VOTES SO FAR
---------------------------------------

**@NIK leading the way with 12 votes** 
NOTE: Some of the votes might be dodgy but, in general, the design on the front is a good one so will give you the benefit of the doubt. I personally don't like the back though it's a bit tacky. Your other designs that had 11 votes got ignored becauseIi think the people are not invested in the community to count. & they weren't as good as this design.

**Next up is** 
**@King1017 in 2nd place With 6 votes.**
This one has proven to be a popular choice!... When I first saw the design I instantly liked it, nice & clean and a good message

----------


----------


**Finally is @onloop new design from yesterday with a healthy 5 votes.**
Of course, I like this one :) I really tried to capture the essence of what are all doing.

**An honorable mention also goes out to** 
**@sk8ace** with a solid 4 votes. This is a simple design, mostly text and a minimalistic emblem style badge. I like the style and think it has a strong message.

Now if anyone else want to submit a design do it now!, remember you can submit up to 3 each....

Ultimately this is about the best design... I personally ain't going to wear a piece a shit design neither is anyone else... Anyway I do feel these top 4 are all good designs and wearable (if @nik changes the back of his)

In one week we have a final round of voting based on the top designs. So if you think you have a better design then these four shirts get your shit together and submit it and your design can be in the final round of voting.

**So In one week we will start a poll**

**something like this - DONT VOTE YET**

[poll]
 - World's Greatest electric Skateboard Engineer 
 - Electric Skateboard Builders Unite
 - Because Perfromance Matters
 - Dream, Build, Ride, Repeat
[/poll]

NOTE: I can't WIN the skateboard deck!...  So if my shirt happens to get more votes than the other designs simply because people like the design better that's totally ok - remember it's a design comp not a popularity contest!
So if that happens the prize will be awarded to the design with the next highest number of votes...

Well I was designing a poster for my self before, but eventually this could work pretty well with a T-Shirt print. I choose grey as a neutral color and I like the material selection alot when longboarding as it feels super breathable. Black on black also makes it super subtile, at least that's my taste.

If other's choose 2 sided, I prefer 1 side at the moment.
Faster to print, cheaper and no gimmicks.
Anyway most of the time I see people longboarding with jacket / hoodie / etc, so those back prints are not going to be visible :)
