well, im sure you all are hoping to hear stories of possibly strippers galore and tons of ass... and while yes this is some what true... pole con  along with a couple other summer pole conventions is more for those what are into pole and aerial of all walks, sizes and ages.

there are lots of workshops to attend from pole dance, aerial, dance choreo, inversions like handstand and more acrobatic things , floorwork and things like that. We have solo performances all day which are broken into seperate categories like... comedy, sexy, mens, power pole (which is more acrobatic and trickster kinda stuff..) plus size, contemporary, then theres usually a feature showcase in the eve which is the best... usually a "black girls pole" where they bring the pain its great. 

somehow even after 10yrs people still dont know we have pretty decent size market niche and growing...

referring back the beginning of my post if one is hoping to see more tits n ass and hotties running around honestly, one would be better off attending more of a sex/porn type of trade show like Exxotic or something like that... but those are just sex industry and promo with porn stars and hot models hired to hand out stuff... but not really a whole lot of actual talent and performers n stuff.

if you just search pole co on youtube you can see plenty of different stage performance... but doesnt show as much about the rest of whats going on.... alhtough there are some on the official channel which has decent background promo info

Dear fantastic Dave,
I want to take this opportunity to remind you, that while your "friends" are making fun of you in the most despicable way, I have refrained from joining in or liking one of these horrendous posts.
Please remember that when I re-order from you :wink:

Your true friend,

Taz

Apparently because they are separate lists one could technically vote twice :grimacing:

Now I see how we could beautify people and as I'm not so familiar with all of you guys, it's bit complicated for me to point someone.
So, did you think it could be **a thing** this time, to try ..? If it's not funny enough, I could designate myself with a [super esk8 shoot](https://amadridefr.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/fb_img_1528848973372.jpg) :smile: ... up to you, don't want to frustrate you.

I don’t think Trampa is about to steal their own design...sorry I get the feels over the whole vesc shit, the no hangers to Jens shit, the general tie it all up shit

But this deck is a HolyPro with a labia

Ok that is a bit rude sorry and I meant Carver rather than HolyPro, but the origins are there as well as improvements.

Wondering about the concave in fact as a flat deck is what I find killing my feet, does the concave run across the width imperceptibly (can’t see from pics) or is it the lips on the side only?

@banjaxxed 
I understand your point but the community took a beating from them for the last 2 years and they ended up doing the same thing they accused  everyone here of doing. 

Check this post 
https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/trampa-spur-gear-drive-with-helical-option-trampa-6380s/74883/29?u=kaly

So we are going to have a bit of clean FUN at their expenses, I think they can handle this just fine. 

On the deck the outline shape of the angle tip is similar after that the construction, materials, materials grade, curvature, epoxy mix, Gas pedals and more features are all different. 

 In the end this are similar just as a Toyota Camry is to a Honda Accord, the overall shape tells you both are cars but that is as far as it gets, since a design is not only it’s outline.

That's all true Bro, please don't take my comments to heart, your deck looks mighty good, not sure how you managed to out so much product recently until I realised, truely amazing, looking forward to working your gear drive into something...soon

Any idea if you'll do a 9" lip mod to the hubs to allow 9" tires? A la Trauma Megasaurus's , 3DNoVisas Fatjoys & MBS Fourskins? :joy:

Ps. Do you have a retrofit helical option for the original gear drive?
Pps. Not sure if the XL 2.0 has concave still, across the deck? Flat feet are a bane to comfort, I'd really like to make something with a tipped deck, foot hooks and comfortable, just for cruising
Ppps. I'm all for making fun and being made fun of

Let see how long it will take them to do it
I think 3 months

What you think ?

I'll buck the trend and remind you gentlemen that Frank and the Trampa team have never really followed the pack, nor have they had issues designing desirable products. 

I get that people don't like Franks antics (neither do I) but credit should be given where it's due. This is a bit beyond you Kaly, you're a cool guy and while things went south with Trampa and we sympathize I think it's a bit weak to start throwing digs at the company that you built your entire business on as a base.

Don't take my comments personally, just my thoughts.

The photoshop titles are normally temporary.  Gets passed on to each winner.  So people go back to thier old title after someone else wins.  A dethroning kinda thing. 
At least that's how we used to do it.
