Your thoughts?

 Are prebuilt esk8 the answer if replacement parts or after market parts are available to upgrade and modify?

I don‚Äôt think the diy world will ever be completely gone,  I do think that prebuilt are selling a lot more right now mostly because of the amount of new people giving up on their diy boards or not even trying.  Thanks to ‚Äúpropaganda‚Äù by some company‚Äôs that their boards will beat diy boards in many aspects...

I think one aspect of esk8 is always going to be DIY.  Simply because some people would rather build custom or better than what is available.  I personally don't have a board over 4 months old because I either rebuild it I to something new or someone offers me more money that I can turn down for it.  

I sold a Vaugenhausen with x2 TB 190kv motors and TB VESC's with a 10s3p 25r pack for 1000 bucks just riding at the park one day.   Went home, orders parts for a new build, grabbed another board and went riding some more. 

I've built 12 +/- Jeeps over the last 20 years, now I build rocket powered murder boards...for fun üòä.

IMHO there will always be DIY because when you do it yourself, the only limit is you. 

That's why we will keep discovering unseen ideas and crazy setups. DIY allows the freedom companies can't usually afford to offer with their products. 

And if you played Legos when you where kid, chances are high you want to play something else today.

What got me started in Diy was choice.
Mainly deck choice.
I wanted to be able to hand pick my deck and not just accept what was offered.
And that was just the beginning.
The ability to choose every component and build a totally custom board.
I don't know if you can even put a value on that.
And right now I'm gonna go for a spin on my totally custom 6000 watt board with dual 6374s and 11.5" x 32" wheelbase

Let's face it, building a diy board is a lot of work and requires a lot of tools and know how.
It's not for everyone.
Let's give credit to the few makers of complete boards that are not willing to sacrifice quality and performance for mass sales but rather cater to those who are willing to invest in a quality board but don't have the ability to build their own.
Still, I believe that Diy will live on because there will always be those who can and will build their own.

Agree with all sentiments shared so far.  DIY teaches you so much about yourself and your ability to innovate, solve problems, balance your checkbook (lol).  I am taking up CNC machining, 3d printing, CAD/CAM, etc.  It develops a unique set of skills across many disciplines to do this. Maybe it will just be a hobby, maybe you can turn it into a business, definitely worth being part of the electric vehicle revolution that is soon to pick up more and more steam to mobilize 7 billion people as oil reserves will disappear in the next 20+ years (and cost of exploration is prohibitive compared just using electric vehicles).

In reality though, this is an adrenaline electric vehicle sport... the average person isn't going to ride an electric skateboard. It's for the young and those young at heart. You can buy a Tesla, or Leaf, or an electric scooter if it's purely about EV mobility, that will likely do for the average Joe.

It's a piece of wood (or carbon fiber weave blah blah), 4 wheels and a dream for motion.

My friend has an Evolve GT but when he saw my Trampa E-MTB he was blown away, inspired even.  Evolve and pre-builts provide a quick fix of adrenaline but not the understanding and pride of building your own. 

It's like when you buy a car they say the reason you are happy is at that very moment, you are free from desire - it's a moment of liberation from the consumption-happiness driven world we live in. That's what it's like buying an Evolve or Boosted or what-not.

;) Got to get back to making food for my lady friend so that when she passes out I can get to my workshop ;) muhahaha

DIY innovates more than prebuilts! A lot of what is prebuilt is just a cheaper and easier to manufacture by the masses version of what was once DIY originated.

DIY will always exist as many do it not always for practical reasons, but just for the enjoyment of making something yourself. It is just a part of the hobby for a lot of us, and I hope we keep growing :D

this is going to make me sound old as hell but i'm afraid a lot of young folks these days (not including the young-uns on here already) don't care about learning new skills or putting in time to hone a craft.

it know it's a broad generalization, and my observations are strictly anecdotal, but there seems to be an anti-exceptionalism that's broadly accepted across the younger generation.  and i can see why.  the prospect of prosperity is becoming increasingly out of reach.  but setting aside social economics...

if i'm a kid right out of high school, or attending college, why would i waste my already thinly spread time to build something i could easily buy?  and look, casey neistat's so cool on a boosted, i want the same thing.

there's always room for diy, but nothing beats flashy packaging backed up my multi-million dollar marketing campaigns.

A production board, the Yuneec E-Go2($700 when I got it,$350 now) was the first skateboard I ever stepped on in 28yrs, was an e/bike guy my whole life.After it proved to be an effective and reliable method of transportation and a few months of riding at full throttle(13mph :unamused: ) and understanding how it all worked(after having to do a few repairs), I started looking for ways to upgrade. That led to me getting a vesc which garnered another 4-5mph top speed. That was sufficient  for a short while. Now I'm on a complete DIY doing 25mph and upgrading to dual this week üòã
Oh and it's a much better form of exercise than I ever imagined, best shape I've ever been since I started esk8ing.

Personally I like building more than riding. Actually I almost never ride (with esk8ing being illegal in Germany I am scared of getting caught) but always find something to modify or change or whatever.
So for me DIY is a hobby just like yoga might be for others.

I do find the building to be equally or more enjoyable at times but my esk8 is my primary form of transportation so it's gotta be in running order before I leave for work and when I leave....thus I'm building a 2nd board that will be the "let's see what we can tweak today" board and the 1st will always be ready, set, go üòÅ

I'm the contrary : I prefer riding but I HAD to get in DIY because what I want doesn't exist ! It is satisfactory to successfully get something working (for example soldering my VESCs and compiling own firmwares etc, I learnt a lot).

 Still what fueled me these past years was : I'm closer and closer to take this to the streets!

Unfortunately, I have to agree with you on that, most of us just try to scrape by by doing the absolute minimum, NOT taking the time to understand what they‚Äôre typing or saying or writing.  I just watched 3 hours of videos about differential gears so I can try to figure out a way to do 1 motor, 2 wheel drive...

I would go a bit further and say that a lot of people just now entering the workforce are not interested in the sciences and mathematics specifically because its become a mass production no incentive for passion muck house, the arts and trades are still recruiting pretty well.  I theorize that most people going into the arts are doing it because they WANT it, not for monetary gains.  Most people going into trades simply don't see a reason to invest 200k in a degree that will essentially make them more knowledgeable but not garner them anymore income.

I have 4 kids, 1 has graduated college with a degree in marketing and teaches English as a second Language in Taiwan.  Another is in college now, pursuing a degree in the Arts, acting and musical theatre specifically.  My2 youngest are both active in the arts programs at their high school, which is a fine arts school...and I'm a n engineer.

I think over the next 30 to 40 years you will see a lot of engineering/mathematics/science skills become more lucrative because so few people see a reason to pursue them.  Cant blame people really, its not a lucrative position any longer considering the cost of a degree.

I believe, there will always be DIY. That's mostly the reason why I got into it.

Pre-built will always be around since it caters to the masses.

I have more commercialized options for DIY in the works and to make the process much easier.
The goal is to build more reliable products that will last.

A few items we have in the works.
- New ESC (Will constantly strive to improve upon it)
- Durable Enclosures
- Hybrid AT/Street Setup

I'd like to thank everyone who has supported us. We have a lot of new stuff coming to build a more solid and reliable eboard. :)

@thisguyhere - I don't think it's that bad.. Now more then ever thousands of people can learn electronics and engineering simply through youtube. I wish all this stuff was around/available when I was in grade school. You got kids at 12-14 teaching themselves amazing things nowadays. I've got an email me and someone mentioned they've gone into engineering because they built a DIY eboard.

They may be more interested in the end product than learning new skills. But along the way, building a DIY board will better their skills. Nobody says I want to learn to solder, so I'll build an eboard. But building an eboard will increase their skills and increase their understanding of electrical engineering. Meaning I didn't know the things I learned until during and after my builds.

Electric skateboards are on the verge of an explosion.  They are going to be everywhere.  People that don't skate are even  using them for metro transport.   It's been a standstill in skateboarding.  they will advance as fast as computers.  Automobiles are all going in the electric direction as well. Esk8ers will know more about the electric cars then the car owners.  There will be 3 types of esk8rs 

1.)  The total DIY person that builds and customizes everything.  These boards will also be subcontracted out to have work done for them like a car in a hot rod shop. these will be the fastest in the end.

2.) The semi DIY that buy complete full kits / plug and play. or changes components on existing complete factor boards.  like buying a meepo board and changing the deck or changing motors on your evolve.

3.) From the factory only skater

Sadly, powered boards will be limited by regulations (they already are in most parts of the world).
New and stricter regulations will be enforced the more powered boards are ''obstructing'' regular traffic. Bike riders and pedestrians will start complaining, etc.

Bigger companies might come up with way to conform to regulations in different countries, meaning that specific boards will be legal. Most DIY boards will not.

Same happened in the drone industry. The exact opposite may also become true..hopefully. I still remember a time where snowboarders were not allowed to go down certain slopes in France and Austria. No longer the case.

That said, I don't intend to stick to regular roads. All I might encounter is hunters and Nordic walkers.

If you watch the path that 3D printers took the exact same thing is happening here.  First, there were hackers making them at home, then a couple people started companies that made fairly crappy printers or slight remixes of the open source printers.  From there it split off in 3 directions - high-end, mid-level and low-end; and you could get them in kits or pre-built.  Then came evolution.

Now, thanks to evolution, you can get a really good 3D printer for not a lot of money.

eSk8 will follow the same trajectory.  We are in the "a couple people started companies" phase (and I'm not saying they are making bad esk8's btw) and we are coming up on the split.

People still build their own 3D printers, and people will still build their own eSk8's.  Most of the evolution comes from these people.

Wanted to say - really nice discussion..

**Im also agreeing about these points:**

* Hybrid / urban setups should become more popular

* Price of vesc / other reliable esc should come down, otherwise a decent 'system' for dual motor build might cost more than some 'alternatives' (ebike/ escooter.. etc) if looking from cost perspective

* In my opinion, some form of mechanical brakes would be welcome.. there are still cases where brakes get lost in most inappropriate situations.

--

**What I like to see:**

* NoWinds / esk.de Direct Drive system (no open gears)

* Vesc telemetry integrated remote / app itself.
* More 'crossbreed' wheels - small pneumatics or large urethane wheels / 3d category - 'airless' wheels which @diyeboard offers

* Choice of motors / esk8 part vendors available

Probably more itereations.. but these are what come to mind

This won't happen until there is competition.  Right now since the reference PCB design isn't available... the only guy on this forum who managed to replicate the VESC6 is a fellow @stewii who is supposed to be releasing results shortly.  He said the components cost about ¬£50 and he would be willing to sell for $150 or ¬£100.   I am curious how his board turns out, I think the schematics were from Vedder's beta design, don't know if he included any updates.

yeh, I meant that in general it would get used more. I sort of see it as an innovation. 

On a side note, I suppose anyone could make a box / enclosure for the belt/pulley but that is extra work so not many people do this. 

Some / most commercial boards probably are doing this already, but then the system is not as 'compact' and seems to be causing other problems (belt rubbing, loose compartment / enclosure, etc)

Also for longboard it might not be as needed as for mountainboards which might face mud, water.. salt / snow etc.. Though I really liked @MoeStooge build with his directdrive spurgear longboard using inrunner motor. .. That was also something unique I had not seen in a while when i first saw his build (not to mention his 'stabilizing' arms (not to confuse with these springy things people are making fun of)

Gear ratio is a little hard to maintain on the direct drive on smaller wheel sets--they work well on MBS/Trampa type or similar hubs but I don't think on Kegel hubs.  I think Jens will be making a smaller one to accommodate the 125mm gummies coming out soon.

I agree with you on this point. I was thinking about trying to make my own too for a future build.  Compared to other mounts -- it's easier to reproduce (pricewise not engineering sense) rather than a 60-70T drive pulleys made of aluminum aren't do-able at home. You have to have a vertical CNC mill which are a lot more expensive than a CNC router (like XCarve, Shapeoko, 6040, 6090) to cut HTD 5M pitch pulleys. The last two cut aluminum and stainless steel really well because they come with 1500W -- 2200W spindles.

So without the 60-70T or whatever diameter drive pulley not needing to be CNC milled, then all you really have to do is find a nylon drive gear and a metal motor spur for the gear portions.   I think he gets these directly from http://www.maedler.de/

The remaining plates can be done using a regular CNC router and perfect for the home hobbyist CNC'er even.

Anyways, it's an interesting idea, I am kind of sold on the direct drive as well. You would have to make all the parts fit together just perfectly - Jen's probably spends 100's of hours getting those gears and trucks to fit just right ;)  The fit is so perfect I am just daunted to even try.

As with your previous comments, esk8 DIY vendors aren't well capitalized and you can't find a one stop shop easily that has good inventory, etc.  How many of these websites do you go to and many are routinely out of stock. That's the core issue... not well capitalized and then the margins... they stink. Motors don't have great margins... maybe motor mounts do if you can get a large volume.  I think many enter the business and then leave after a while.

Looking good!

1) How will you cover up those gears? At a 90 angle it will be a little difficult to find a common plane to cover those on.

2) Assuming the motors won't be flying in the air :) I guess you will create an L-profile type motor mount from the motor shaft?

I wish I had more time to work on them...  

Weekends are just about the only time I can sit down and work on them for more than 2 hours.  Soon to be eliminated once I get my work permit

@DougM sometimes it's not even sand....

Ain't that right @MoeStooge? Sometimes it's a little bit of tissue paper that can get you. Lol 

I think a cover would be needed.

The problem with making a gearbox is size...

It would only be possible with 90+mm wheels, unless you wanted to run like 5tooth to 20 tooth  üòÇ

Hahah yeah man Ask @MoeStooge...We did a group ride in Venice California....one minute he's behind me....second later...gone... a stupid piece of tissue paper just got sucked up into his gears.... and you know what happens then right? Lol good thing Moes short like me....wasn't a far fall to the ground hahhahaha

Not to dissuade you at all -- but why not build on Jenso's design of the two gears just being on the same plane?  But instead you implement a helical gear design for better tooth binding?  Also it will be easier to cover up then.  This sideways pinion and gear design you are doing looks different and similar to a car's transmission transfer case but I think the cover will be tricky.  I think I remember you posting about a helical gear design in the past.

It's just an idea - do carry on - still curious how your mount will look.

Precision gears like the helical are very unforgiving and need to be aligned precisely.

with any helical gear setup the tendency is for one gear to want to push out of plane from the other gear.  This then requires a fairly hefty frame to keep them all together.  One possible solution is to use the (I'm sure there's a name for it) type of gear they use in 3D printer extruders

If you've got a 4 axis mill handy you can make them using an End Mill Gear Cutter which, last time I checked didn't exist but now [does](http://www.supercapitaltools.com/images/products/end-mill-gear-cutters.png)

Herringbone gear, the only problem is manufacturing, but they are not worth in our case, the axial loading exist, but it's cheaper to solve by using the correct bearings and a new axle to support them than make a gear like this

Could one put two opposite helical gears parallel to each other (on the same shaft), creating what appears to be a herringbone pattern, and cancel out the axial loads?

Yes, but by solving one problem you can end up with a lot more, of the gear are not perfectly aligned one half will take all the load, and making then aligned is hard, you could weld booth, but them there is a chance that the heat will misalign them further
