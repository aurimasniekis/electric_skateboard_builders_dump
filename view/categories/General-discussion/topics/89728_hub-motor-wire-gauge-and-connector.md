I have [this](http://www.diyeboard.com/dual-hub-motor-9052mm-1000w75kv-power-truck-front-truck-kit-p-558.html) hub motor that comes with male bullet connectors for the phase wires (size 3.6mm * 4.8mm * 14mm). The phase wires seem to be 20 AWG imo.

I would like to connect them to a vand vesc. On the vanda vesc I have banana plugs (10 AWG) which are not matching the bullet connectors of course...

First question: Is 20 AWG in combination with the vanda vesc ok? I could cut the bullet connectors and solder banana plugs on it but the wires seem a bit too thin or is it ok to do?

wire thickness is only important for amps.

If the motor uses 20 awg wires from the factory, it probably doesn't need any thicker than that. Your vesc won't put out more amps than the motor needs so it's all fine :) You can solder on bigger connectors to fit the vesc. No problem :)
