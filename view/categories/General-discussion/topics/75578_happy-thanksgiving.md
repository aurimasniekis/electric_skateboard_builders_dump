I know it's not a worldwide celebration but I sure am thankful for this site and all of the people on here offering guidance and wisdom. Have a safe and blessed day regardless of where you are!

Also I got to ride my board to a neighbors to pick up eggs this morning for a recipe we misplanned for. It was epic.
