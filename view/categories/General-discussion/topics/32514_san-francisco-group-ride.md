Hi. I'm looking to start my first build and was looking for advice on motor type and setup. From the research I've done, belt is better than hubs for SF (hills) and a single motor will not be enough. Would other SF folks mind sharing details on their dual belt motor setups?

Carbonated has overgone a lot of upgrades and changes. Honey Driver is about the same.

I'm good. Still waiting for the surgery, but I can ride and do most things without any pain.
