Are there any VDLA like apps that are optimized for mobile? Preferably an Android app that I can use locally? 

VDLA works on mobile, but the interface is a pain in the butt to use that way.

I run Ackmaniacs firmware and haven't tried metr yet (don't know if it works or not), but Ackmaniacs app works great on my phone, I'd just like to see more details in the logs like VDLA shows, ideally without having to use a browser interface... But if there are browser interfaces optimized for mobile, that would be a nice alternative.

Couple of weeks ago I asked @DeathCookies (the developer of vdla) if he could work with @Ackmaniac on integrating this into the app itself. Not sure if they came to an agreement or what the status is though.

I did Plan an updated Version but i have not found the time or money yetâ€¦

Improvements i want to made:
- launch from Ackmaniac app
- better ui (done) 
- better maps visualization
- saving Logs (but that will be expensive)
- some secret stuff

oh no sorry to hear - hope you'll find a better one soon. I did not want to put pressure on you - just thought I'd share that I already asked and that we'd have to wait until there is something to talk about.

Hi @DeathCookies. Good to see VDLA is improving, it's a wonderfull tools.
Some users of iOS eskate VESC app notice a unit problem. I've been looking this problem to fix the bug, and I discover the Speed_Unit flag is not working anymore in VDLA. When I change it to 0 or 1, I still have metric in the "board settings" and wrong values in the "statistic" max_speed value. Even if I'm using metric units. 
Is it a bug ?

The VDLA tool is down :sob:
Do you have technical difficulties or are you going to close this service of yours?

If so could you share it with us so we can run it?
