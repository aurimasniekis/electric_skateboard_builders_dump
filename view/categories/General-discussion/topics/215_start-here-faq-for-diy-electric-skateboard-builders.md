**If you are planning to build your first electric skateboard at home you probably have lots of questions, most of the questions you have are the same questions everyone has at the start! Questions such as what battery? what motor KV? what ESC? The answers to these questions can often be found by doing some reading first**.

Lately there are more people coming into the forums and although there are alot of active members involved, we can't just simply answer all of the questions especially simple and or common questions all the time.

**Please spend time to read!** Read other people build, understand their budget and performances! There are alot of esk8 builds in this forum and they all end up pretty well. Search for the highest views and or highest reactions and You will get your answer quicker rather than repeating other people simple questions.

#PLEASE READ FIRST and Search!#
and even if you encounter a problem with your build, **Please use the search function!**
It makes other members find their answers easier without repeating reading the same solutions over and over.

Around 80% of starter questions are almost dealing with the same problems. **So if you are very new**, **you don't want to make mistake (happens very often for unexperienced builder)**, you want to save budget, you don't want to miss ordering some parts, you don't want to wait for longer or double shipping cost.

Read, search and make your list. Good luck!:wink:

#Basic FAQS:
**1. Does making eSkate require electronics / mechanics knowledge?**
No, you can learn by reading this forum, ask questions to other members / moderators. It would be helpful to help you kick start, avoid mistakes, build a reliable board. We all learn this knowledge through other members within this community too.

**2. Is it actually possible that those small RC hobby motor push me around?**
Yes. At first that is also rather strange for most of us, but those motor are highly powerful with gobs of torque. Some configuration would take you 35 degree climb and or top speed exceed 50kmh. The acceleration is ridiculous. But **keep in mind that most motor we use here are brushless motor (BLDC motor - 3 cables motor) between 90kv - 260kv.**

**3. How could it be that just now we have this eskating possible and not some years ago?**
A very good question. I do believe that within the old days, building eskate motor like this is possible. However there wasn't simply powerful enough batteries and electronics that run high amperage to actually push people around. With the inventions of the RC industries, the battery technologies (LiPo and Liion) its made possible.

**4. How to get started?**
This is a very broad questions, I believe everyone here have their own ways. At least I started by just reading some builds within this forums. Those experience builders mostly list all parts or show some techniques or tips to get awesome results. However I learned alot through reading common members build threads where they made mistakes / miss orders / forgetting to purchase some parts. Therefore I wouldn't repeat same common people mistakes during my assembly. I would also encourage you to get started with your own build thread, asking reviews and mention your parts. It would be beneficial for all of us at the end of the day.

Hi I just bought this motor from alien power systems:http://alienpowersystem.com/shop/brushless-motors/alien-5070-hev-sensored-outrunner-brushless-motor-270kv-2200w/
The thing it unlike sk3 motors which have a flat spot, this motor has a keyway.
Do you think it will still work with this sprocket:http://www.ebay.com/itm/1-4-12T-Rotary-Chain-Drive-Sprocket-12-Tooth-Pitch-6-35mm-Bore-5-6-8-10mm-/161940970678?var=&hash=item25b46f1cb6:m:m3rf6KeBnmJqoJmGjfqRq2g
Basically I m trying to figure out if set screws work with keyways.

Hi, I am planning to build something which is quite similar to electric skate board but it has an auto pilot function to "follow me" the subject it wanted to follow. I am an enthusiast road cyclist that witnessed too many cases where cyclist get run over by car or motorcyclist from behind. My project involve an electric skate board in principal with auto pilot function to follow the cyclist from behind with flashing lights to warn the rear incoming traffic about cyclist at the front.

My questions are as follow:

i. Since my electric skate board won't be carrying people but only some electronics gadget, what will be the size of motor i need for 30kg load?
ii. what is the battery size needed to power the motor for 8 hours or more? I wanted the electric skate board to be able to run 7 hours straight because sometimes i will need to cycle 7 hours. 
iii. I would like my skate board to be able to turn 180 degree, what mechanism can i install on the skateboard?

Thanks.

Hi, I just bought everything I need tonbuild an E-Boarf because I'm doing one for school. The problem is that I only bought 1 5s lipo battery and I am wondering if it's possible to make my E-board without buying another one because all of it is quite expensive. 

Thanks in advance,

I built a skateboard with only one engine and two-wheel drive.
I modified the engine. What do you think? <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/f/c/fc8884d52e541ec29ee853e011434120bddb9dc0.jpg" width="690" height="497">https://youtu.be/BjJrPzoXaeI

I cannot imagine how you will drive a curves. The wheels on the left or ride side have to spin faster to make a curve. In your design the back two wheels will always spin the same rpm?

Hello,
I just signed up for this forum. I am in the process of building my first electric skateboard. I have a 41" Globe Pinner. I swapped the stock trucks for Caliber II 50's with 1/2" spacers and 83mm Flywheel clones. I ordered a 63mm motor, motor mount, and belt/pulley kit from Enertion. I have a Traxxas  Transmitter/Receiver from a previous RC Truck I will be using. I also have 2 - 2S Turnigy Nanotechs and have ordered a third. I will be creating a harness to wire all three in series for 6S power. I have yet to buy an enclosure but I think I will be using a Plano 3600 series waterproof box for batteries, VESC & Receiver. Should give me room for up to 4 - 2S Lipos and VESC/Receiver. I want to use an RC switch to turn power on and off and possibly a volt meter to mount on top to use as a gas gauge. I have questions about creating a wiring harness to tie all 3 Lipos together for balance charging. I want to buy a 6S balance plug and wire so that my charger thinks my 3 - 2S lipo's are just 1 6S lipo. Also not sure if Enertion X-VESC will accept or have a place to plug in an ON/OFF power switch. I have some pics and a wiring diagram I will try to upload so you can see what I am working with. That's all for now.

A real novice newbie here. I got 2x 5000mAh 3S 25C Lipo pack connected in series. How long would this battery last for me? (I have a single motor setup SK3-6364-245kv)

I am looking to get atleast an hour worth of ride time. I don't care about speed, but distance is more important for me.

I hear that I can get another 2xbattery (as mentioned above). How would that affect my battery time in distance if I connect in 1. Series 2. Parallel.

Any & all help is highly appreciated!!

Thats a pretty small pack. I use 2x 5200mah 6s in series and get 12-16 miles...maybe more if I could go slower.... :joy:
If you don't go fast you get more range. longer ride time.

depends on your esc how to set them up.

I think I'll make a post on my webpage about range. :thinking:

```

---
## \#42 Posted by: goldenHusky Posted at: 2017-01-14T17:13:49.570Z Reads: 1019

@Lucas123  xt90 can handle more current (xt60 = 60 ampere, xt90 = 90 ampere)
Be aware that you probably loose warranty when you replace the connector.

## \#44 Posted by: goldenHusky Posted at: 2017-01-14T17:25:10.713Z Reads: 989

@Lucas123  Under normal conditions a xt60 is sufficient for a dual setup but you might want to use xt90.
There are also xt90 plugs with integrated anti spark switch, xt60 plugs don't feature that.

Hello, have just got into the realm of longboarding and built my own eboard. I have the VESC a 350kv alien motor and flysky gt3 reciever. I tested it for the first time yesterday. It works ok, but i have the following issues:

(In duty cycle mode and bldc mode)

1. when I let off the throttle i get an annoying squealing sound and the wheels lock up or feels like a brake is on

2. when I am on the throttle it is not smooth, it feels like all or nothing, large amount of deadband

3. to get the board going from a standstill it shakes and feels like it is cogging but once it gets going its ok

if you know what settings in the bldc tool would help with these issues please let me know, thanks!

Guys, I'm sure this has been answered elsewhere but I haven't been able to find it. I've just finished putting together my first build and having some belt tension issues. I've got the motor as close to the trucks as possible (mount is basically scrubbing the motor) but the belt is still way too tight - can barely get it on there. Any suggestions/solutions? 

Setup is DIYES 36/16, enertion mount, 265mm belt. Tried a 280mm belt too but there isnt enough adjustment in the mount.

Hello everyone!
I am currently piecing together the parts for my first build, but I don't know if all of them will work together.
My main concern is the the motor mount kit with the wheels, but I also have no idea about if the motor will fit either. Any help  is much appreciated! Thankyou!

## \#62 Posted by: laurnts Posted at: 2017-02-23T16:43:39.501Z Reads: 703

```
The rule of thumb for motor is always 280kv or lower with 1:3 gear ratio at minimum. This is by far the safest point to get started. If you buy cheap motor with higher kv, the chances if its not strong enough is that you will need to buy another one in which it will cost you more money.

6 cells lipo ok.
60 AMP esc abit low, get something more than 100 AMP so that it doesn't get easily over heating.

Low specs for electric longboard works, but it wil get burned down / broken very fast.
These motors and electronics are meant to run 3kg object and not 60kg++
So keep in mind, more torque + better electronics = longer life + pleasure experience.

Hi there community! I'm new to the forum and to the esk8 world. I´ve been skateboarding since i was 7 and just recently discovered Esk8´s! I´m planning on gathering knoweldge and building my own electric cruiser. Looking forward in participating and creating great stuff! Congrats on the great forum! Cheers!

410kv is fine you just have to add more mechanical gearing or lower the voltage (in which case you'll need an esc that can do more amps to get the same power).
you can actually get more torque from a high kv motor that is geared down than a low kv that doesn't have the same high gear ratio.   the speed of the high kv is converted to torque

Hello Guys 

I have a question about the VESC:

is it possible to run the motor without the VESC and if yes, then how 

thank You for Your answers

A brushless motor like we use needs a driver, so you can´t simply take a battery and put a motor on.
So yes, an ESC is needed.

ok thank you 

i ask because a friend of mine has a brushless motor conected to the receiver and instead of a VESC he conected a Servo so is it possible to controll the servo trough a remote so i dont need a VESC ?

I recently brought VESC-X and Space battery pro from enertion and I was wondering I need to get a regulated power supply in order to configure the VESC-X for the first time. In the VESC guide, it was highly recommended to do so, but as I recall Chaka thinks that you only need to do this when powering up for the first time. I believe onloop said all the VESC-X have been tested before shipping. So does this mean I can use the space battery to power up the VESC-X for configuration without bricking it?

Also on the VESC-X it says "V1.3". Is this the firmware version or just the version number of the VESC-X? If so where can I find the firmware version of the VESCX I have?

Hey guys,
im in the UK
im 14 and i have built my own electric skateboard but its not great
i used to be able to go 20mph but now i can only go 16.4. Anyone can help? Maybe i stored my batteries at a two high voltage or i lost one magnet in my motor?  Im going to change to chain drive in the coming days and I'm planning on using a bms but i don't want to mess up my batteries.Im using 2 5000mah 25c lips with car esc and turnigy motor. thanks

Hey guys! Been lurking around here for a while deciding on how I would go about either building or buying an electric skateboard. I'm 22 and live in the great state of Texas. Anyways I've been riding my electric skateboard that I bought online for around 300 bucks for quite a while but I was sorta looking for an upgrade in speed and power. The skateboard is a blitzart single hub motor long board and it surprisingly rides really well for a cheaper electric skateboard. My question at the end of the day would be if I bought another hub motor would I be able to add it somehow to my already complete electric skateboard or would it be best to start over new entirely ? I have no idea if it's taboo here to talk about a complete electric skateboard opposed to making one from scratch. Any help is greatly appreciated!

Welcome on board!
Lot of people come here from a complete and want to tune it a bit or add things like batteries, motors or stuff.
Some of them are ok with the updates, but a lot of them spending more money, than what starting a new build would have costed.
So keeping your complete as it is for a friend would be good and start a new build for you

I agree. If you choose to make a whole new board you also get the ability to really choose exactly what you are looking for in terms of battery, motors, deck and wheels. This allows you to really pinpoint and achieve everything that you felt you were missing on the Blitzart. Weather that be speed, range, torque, stability, ride smoothness, style, or all of the above. If you try to make the changes to your existing build you will be limited by what is already there.

Hey everyone, quick question I am debating on whether or not to put a 190kv motor or a 260kv belt motor on my board. The motors are from diyelectric skateboard. This board is going to be a possible commute to work. I do not have any hills on my commute just flap street / bike path. I know with the 260kv I would have more speed but less torque. Would it really matter since I am not going to be going up any hills? If this comes into affect, I am 180lbs. 

Also might be a stupid question because I feel I know the answer but do I need one ESC for every motor I have? If so, is there a way to tie them all together so they all get activated by the remote?

Thanks!

With that  motor, wheel and gearing you probably won't be able to reach that speed no matter what battery you use. And i think that you motor is too small. You lose all torque with it if you want to go over 20mph with that.

Use this.

63xx sized. And it depend how heavy you are and where you live, if there is some hi hills or something. 
You pulley set is very weird. Any idea what pitch it has? 
You should also notice that with higher kv use lower voltage and lower kv higher voltage. For example 260kv/6s and 190kv/10s are common combos.

Okay so you are light so that motor is fine. You will still suffer lack of torque, but change gearing for example 15/36 so you can get even 20mph. In this case only way i see is higher voltage and vesc and new motor lower kv motor.
With 260kv/6s systen car esc is enough. You just can't get enough speed. 
I have to ask that do you have experience from downfill or why so hi speed?

I've done a quick search but can't seem to find the answer I'm looking for so I'll ask here.

And to preface, this could possibly be the biggest noob question of them all.

Why use belts at all? Why not just gear to gear contact from motor to wheel? You can still alter the gearing ratio I believe to get desired speed/torque output.

I'm just trying to figure out how Jed Boards have done their "Direct drive no belts or hubs, no maintenance" set up.

Thanks in advance.

Hey guys, So I recently made a board. Everything works fine, except fro when I want to coast. The second I pull my finger off the trigger I feel the board kickback. The first time this happened I flew off the board and scraped up my arm.  

All that aside I set the pulse-width properly and did everything I think I could possibly do.

My Build:
VESC
3 - 5000mah LiPo 4s
TorqueBoard Nano Remote
8x40 Deck
90mm Wheels
12mm Pulley
6355 190kv Motor

 @kieraneboard the cost of my time to make and edit the video is worth more than the value of the board.
i am happy to give an unbiased review and compare with other boards that folks in this community who are UK based and are willing to bring along for the video shoot.
but i am not looking to buy a new board and to be honest i wouldn't wish to pay for shipping. I am happy to return the board if you will pay for shipping both ways. I review a lot of audio and music production grear for magazines and the expensive stuff (£5k+) usually works this way, same with pre-production models. that said a lot of companies are happy to let me keep the equipment...

kWeld - "Next level" DIY battery spot welder

It originally started as a one-off, but through continuous support from https://endless-sphere.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=14&t=89039 and http://www.eevblog.com/forum/projects/guesses-on-what-i-am-attempting-here/ , I am now able to offer my solution as a kit for purchase.

http://www.eevblog.com/forum/projects/guesses-on-what-i-am-attempting-here/?action=dlattach;attach=332388

Here are some key specs of my system:

Hardware:
    Input voltage for welding: 12V – 30V
    Extremely rugged MOSFET-based power switch and mechanical current bus design
    Maximum switch current: 2000A
    Power switch internal resistance: 120µOhm
    Logic supplied directly from battery – no need for a separate auxiliary power supply

Software:
    Central weld control algorithm uses a Joule metering approach instead of a simple timer, eliminating the need for two-pulse firing and providing more consistent welds – the amount of energy that is deposited into the weld spot is always kept constant
    Ability to detect a failed weld, and acoustic feedback to the user
    Manual mode, triggered from external switch
    Automatic mode, accompanied with a warning sound and triggered with a 0.5sec delay, once the system detects that both electrodes are in steady contact with the weld material
    Audible feedback of weld process completion
    Numeric feedback from an executed weld, assisting the user to achieve best results: deposited energy amount, required pulse time for this energy, measured current flow, measured ohmic resistance of weld spot

It is not the cheapest solution on the market, but it has shown bullet proof stability. It is more than capable of welding 0.3mm nickel strips.

These videos show the system in action:

Hey there new member here, I was wondering if anyone had ever done it before,  has anyone ever converted and e-glide to wireless by changing out the electronics to a regular ESC that can handle 36 V,  and if so can anyone recommend an ESC that could handle that type of power being 36 V input

Hi guys I read onloop's post about "C" output and why it's important however I'm still a bit confused. 

Does a 6s 5ah 20C battery have enough max amps to power a 270kv motor? I think this means I have a max 100A output, but is that enough to move a 70kg person to the boards max speed? Or is it better if I get 30C?

Basically I have an e-glide 42 special and it has 3-12 volt batteries in series and it has an 800 watt motor, but for the control unit it has a board type deal it's not an esc, it has a wired controller. I was wondering if there was an esc out there that would work with the board in place of that little control unit.

Can't create a new topic so I guess ill just rant here

So, I built my board 18 days ago. Today I have a burned DRV

Specs:
10s3p
Torqueboards 6355 190kv dual
4.12 Torqueboards VESCs

I've put 293 miles on this board in the past couple of weeks all has been fine and lovely. I go on lunch today, come back and as always - when I plug in I test motors and before I unplug I test motors at very low throttle. Anyway back from lunch get to my desk, test motors with a blip, fine. unplug work the rest of the day, goto leave, plug in, test motors, only one motor spins. DRV burnt out. I can't understand why it would burn out from the time of unplugging to plugging back in.

@torqueboards this is about my last straw dealing with them
-sent motors with incorrect barrels
-antispark failed on first plugin(known issue)
-now i've got a dead vesc when nothing has changed lol
-their edge retainer on the motor drive pulleys are lightly pressed in an fall off(basically they're cheap).


electric skateboard gods are killing my buzz right now.

An ESC is responsible for sending power from the batteries to the motor you can't skip on it... the receiver/transmitter you can skip on and have a wired throttle control to the ESC but no ESC means no electronic speed control.

Your situation seems a bit custom. You should look into remoteless / weight sensing boards and so on. Also as suggested u still need esc to control the motor. Maybe @Ackmaniac can shed a quick reply for u to send.u in right direction.

My opinion: assist only might be a bit.hard. You could try to implement what @Ackmaniac has made by getting vesc and running it in mode where u need to kickpush to gain additional speed but.your board will.cruise at speed.it.has.reached.by your."human" power

U can try to install some sort of "flap" like some scooters has. Ive seen some other commercisl designs but all of these will probably be too expensive. If u got someone with tools / skills it might be possible to come up with something otherwise it might be tough to make something like that on your own.. otherwise if u go the car esc route, then brakes might be too sudden or sharp most of the time i think.

Hey guys I'm looking to starting my first board and really looking for some help I want to use the FocBox and have spoken to enertion and they recommended a 190kv motor and said that is what they use on the raptor 2 so I'm looking at this motor https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-aerodrive-sk3-6364-190kv-brushless-outrunner-motor.html with the shaft that has a key slot in it to lock on the motor pulley Now I know this is not a sensored motor but from what I have heard the sensored motors are a little trickier to configure.  Since the FocBox and motor both use 10s I was wondering if this battery would be good for it https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-graphene-4000mah-5s1p-65c.html. I would have 2 connected to it in series making it a 10s2p. It would still be 65C now would the 4000mah go to 8000 or would it stay at 4000mah.
In order to charge these together I believe I would need a bms. Now my goal would be to be able to go 20-25 mph and 12-15 miles.

Hands down, the best anti spark switches you can buy are @goldenHusky's from antisparkheaven.com

I had heard all the stories about solid state switches blowing before, but I decided to buy one from DIYelectricskateboards and sure enough, it either arrived non-functional or blew as I plugged it in for the first time. 

Decided to try one from antisparkheaven and it's been going strong ever since it arrived.

Hi. I have a problem. My problem is batteries. I've been on the forum a couple months now, but there's a basic thing I'm not rly getting. I've seen the big thread where they explain, and tried understanding all the diagrams sent. My dream board has a charging port and an on/off switch. 
I will use lipo batteries. I know how to connect them series/parallel but for the life of me, I do not understand how they connect to the charging port and the on button. I saw some people using bms, but then I saw that most people don't do that, cause that's what you do with li-ions, and there's a different way with lipos. It might be as simple as connecting  an imax b6 to a charging cable, welding the battery cables inside the board to a port of some sort, ( in which case I'll be so pissed at myself for the DAYS of overcomplicating it) but even then, how does the imax connect to the cable? And discharging? Do the lipos do that themselves? And where does the power button come in, as a loop breaker between the batteries and the vesc? One last thing, does a 270 kv motor/6s setup work the same with a vesc, as a 190 kv/10s? Cause someone mentioned to me that 6s isn't enough voltage, which would draw on amps, but does the motor change that? 
Thanks in advance

With Lipos, you either use a **XT90s loop key** or a **anti-spark switch** to power on/off the board...unless you are using a **BMS with an E-Switch**.  Search for the bold terms and you will find a wealth of information.

Hey guys I have a question about loctite:

I want to secure the bolts on my motormount and everything with loctite. Loctite 234 is pretty expensive and I have found loctite in my garage.

It is loctite 570. Do you recommend using it, it has a soft strength (234 has medium). I think this will work because the threads are filled with the loctite so the bolt won't vibrate (the vibration is causing the loosening of the bolt right?)
```

---
## \#181 Posted by: TarzanHBK Posted at: 2018-02-05T07:58:12.509Z Reads: 226

I use medium loctite (different numbers so far) for all screws and bolts and it´s good as it is - holds everything in place but you´re also able to loosen everything with ease.

I used a soft strength loctite once from UHU, but it sucked.. after a few km some of the bolts came loose.. switched to the medium loctite and everything was fine since then.

So in my opinion loctite is totaly worth it. Sure it´s not the cheapest stuff, but even a small bottle will last really long ;)

This sounds like a really good idea that might be possible...

But unfortunately, if these are the questions you are asking I doubt it would be worth your time. "Auto pilot"/autonomy is a cool concept that is becoming more prevalent in our society with technologies such as self driving vehicles, however, implementing such a system is a highly complex task. If this skateboard was going to follow you around the house carrying things I'd say go for it! Following a walking person is much different than following a bicycle in traffic, there is less risk for one and overall fewer sources of interference. Not to mention a reckless destroying something you built from scratch.

I really like the idea, but I don't want you to waste time, money and effort on an unrealistic project. If you have a strong knowledge in vision processing and other robotic systems you might be able to pull it off, but it would still be a difficult feat for even the most skilled robotic engineers. Just trying to be realistic here, good luck on future projects!

Hi,

I tried doing a search on these 2 questions I have but I have not found concrete answers on these topics.

How exactly do you use an anti-spark switch when starting the longboard and also whencharging the batteries? I bought an ESC with a built in receiver, and the ESC has its own momentary switch to turn on or off the board. I assume there is a sequence of which switch to turn on first and whatnot. Can someone outline what I have to do with the ESC switch and the anti-spark switch when I have to charge the batteries vs. when I want to turn on the board for a ride?

My second question is about a BMS board. With a BMS board, do you no longer need a balance charger? And if so, if the BMS doesn't have overcharge protection circuit, what does that mean for me? Do I have to manually monitor the battery voltage and disconnect the power supply as the batteries can get overcharged? Or do the batteries themselves have some sort of electronics so that it stops charging once full?

If someone could explain these two things to me like they would teach a 5 year old, that would be awesome.

Thanks.

If you have a esc with build in switch, you don't need an antispark for that.

With a BMS you don't need a balance charger anymore, the bms is now balance charging.
Every bms should have an overcharge protection.

Hey guys, I couldn't find anything related to my situation. I own a bamboo series one and am looking to upgrade it from a single motor to a dual motor.

So long story short, I obtained a motherboard/motor control unit/electronic speed controller of an Evolve bamboo GT that has two motor plugs and am considering upgrading my single motor series one to two motors. My main concerns are whether my stock battery pack and the bamboo GT motherboard would support 2 200kv motors (1 stock series one from evolve, and 1 racerstar 200kv). I'd like to know how to calculate the potential range impact and possibility of blowing my gt motherboard if i proceed.

Theoretically, all I require to add a new motor is the rear gt strut (that allows for a second motor), a motor mount, one 32T gear, a belt, and another motor.

Shopping list as below:

https://www.evolveskateboards.com.au/collections/spare-parts/products/drive-gear-32t-evolve-abec

Motor: (looking at the 200kv racerstar).

From my understanding, the bamboo series GT has a custom designed 36 volt 6.5AH Lithium Ion battery, whereas my bamboo series One has a 36 volt, 7AH  Li-Ion battery. 

The only difference is that the GT has a total of 3000watt dual motors whereas my setup would potentially be 4000watts.

I am completely knew and have no background in electronics. Should I just purchase a gt board and forget about this upgrade? Or should i consider getting lower rated motors so my board doesn't explode?.

Thanks guys :slight_smile:

You don't want 200kv motors.  The stock Evolve ones are 150kv and the 140kv ones work as well.  The 200kv ones will work but as well.

Hello, I've been thinking of buying DIY electric skateboard sets from AliBaba. The product page isn't much help for me as the specifications of the motors are in watts instead of the usual kV rating. Can somebody help me calculate the actual mile and range of the board or at least translate the wattage to kV ratings.

Hello ppl,

I am in proces of ordering parts to convert my BGTX to dual 6374 board. 

Since I would like to keep evolve supercarve trucks I will be ordering UNIK motor mounts for 63mm motors. 

One thing that's bothering me is that if 2 of the 6374 motors will fit wide wise. I know there are differences in length depending on manufacturer but since I am located in Europe I was looking in street wings motor but I am unable to find exact dimensions of the motor can.

Is there any other Europe based company that makes 6374 motors of around 190KV if street wings can't fit. 

Thanks

Hey guys,

First time builder here, and i have an obscure task ahead of me. I am a film maker and looking to create a documentary to raise awareness for Cystic Fibrosis by taking a DIY board across Europe to various rock climbing. This will also be a tool to show other CF patients that you dont have to live life in a bubble. My brother has CF, and the goal would be to take him and 3 others along with me on this trip. So I would be building 4 different decks to make this happen. Heres the goal of each deck:

Boards:
- Portable
- Removable Battery
- Top speed of 20+
- 30+ mile range (50 miles would be ideal)
- Fast Charging
- Charging while braking w/ switch to turn off brake charging ( if possible )

Here are the main stops of the route if youre curios. All routes are possible on bikes so I figured it'll be just as possible on an esk8. There are some stops that we would take trains or flights just to make it possible. Obviously the 100+ miles would be split in multiple days across a couple smaller cities for charging and rest.

Route:
1.	Tralee 	187 Miles 
2.	Dublin	114.332 Miles
3.	Belfast	$55/ person one way no stop Aer Lingus
4.	London	75.3 Miles
5.	Canterbury   16.9 Miles
6.	Dover 	$56/ Person one way no stop British Airways
7.	Paris 		$66/ Person 1st class
8.	Geneva, Switzerland  39.58134 miles
9.	Frankfurt, Germany    $66/ person one way 1 stop $66

This list maybe added to as well. I am looking at making this happen May 2019.

I need help figuring out what parts to go with, and looking at reaching out to sponsors. Any help would be amazing! 

Thank you,
Parker

Hey ! 

I made a lot of searches about how do you guys center your wheel pulleys but i just don’t found anything, So how do you do ?? 

I’m fighting with mine but I can’t do it properly, it’s only like 2 or 3 mm but it’s bending my motor mount and I don’t wan’t it to broke, like it can bend my motor axis too ...

Is there someone who is selling some wheels with the pulley directly attached to it so it would be perfectly centered ? 

Thank’s !

It sounds like you should be looking at an rc car not a skate board, and there is a good amount of open source stuff for object tracking, but I don't think there is any ready made software for rc cars to do that, and gps would be too inaccurate for the road.  Perhaps you could look in to having someone write you something, if you put a target on your bike it might be doable, a lot of work, but at least feasible, but I am by no means knowledgeable about object tracking ect. so I would double check everything I said. And much better to post on a forum for software/firmware/cs questions.

what you could do is used a brushed dc motor and have wired voltage control to the motor and just run the motor in reverse to break, it would be inefficient and kinda ghetto, but hey, if you want to make it supper cheap, it would work, though im not sure how powerful your breaks would be.  Interestingly enough, the original esk8 boards used dc motors.

[/quote]

@Eretron - you will need the 218mm trucks if you want to  run dual 6374 motors as they won't fit on standard caliber II trucks

not sure how wide supercarve trucks are so I can't confirm that 2 x 6374 motors will fit on those.

Motor specs are on the website:
**Shaft Length:**  23mm
**Length of motor including shaft:**  102mm
**Length of Motor Can:**  69mm
**Width of Motor Can:**  63mm

let me know if you would like any other measurements and I will take them off the motor

well you first need to know how many cells you are going to use in series. Since you are using hubmotors you can calculate it with the topspeed you want because the speed is directly affected by the voltage since there is no transmission between everything (like a belt drive has)

so you are probably going to choose something like 10s (because of the hubs) so you will need a charger made for that cell counting (like 10s). well you are in luck now because if you choose a common cell counting (like 6s,10s,12s) there are custom made chargers for that you can find on almost every site like aliexpress or banggood

I hope this helped you

You are most likely currently in current control mode or torque control. If you want "RPM" control you need to switch to duty cycle control as control mode.

But when riding you will likely prefer current control :) trust me.

[/quote]

You are controlling the current or power, not the RPM or speed.  With no load to drive, a tiny amount of power is all it takes to keep top-speed.  It's working perfectly in your video.  Put that under a skate and it will act exactly as you want it to under load.

So i was reading in another thread, (and didn't want to creat a new one) someone was talking about using two motors with different KV ratings, the lower KV motor for starting torque and the higher KV motor for top speed. My question is what if you used two different sized gears on 2 Motors with the same KV? Lets say a 13t and a 14t. Would that give greater starting torque and higher top speed? Or would that just put too much stress on the motors, VESC, and drivetrain?

So I'm thinking of using a new Loaded Boards: https://i.loadedboards.com/136.htm deck to build my DIY. Anyone ever use any of their boards for a build? Any advice on what to keep in mind? I'm thinking of using thr icarus.

There are hundreds of options for mounts and like anything usually the more you can afford will mean the better the quality! I used TB mounts for 6 months with no issues once I learnt how to correctly tighten them and add locktite blue to the correct spots. 👍

50 $ is appropriate for a mount.The ones sold on here are usually better quality than on the market. Let me find the one I bought here

Hi,

can someone tell me where i can get a good batterie in eu? I heared eskating.eu is not the best place to get one. 

Saw the 12s4p from https:///collections/electric-skateboard-battery-pack/products/electric-skateboard-battery-epower-pack-12s4p but i would really like it to be a flat pack. If i cant find an alternativ i will go with that one because its a very good pack.

10s or 12s and 4p or 5p would be desired. sadly @pjotr47 is not responding on instagram. i heard he is very busy at the moment. is there someone else i can ask?

Hello. I am maybe getting to old for this shit i dont know. But when i grew up on the net. If i had questions they would be answered within the hour. Lately though when i ask google or any engine a question. I have to filter trough serious amounts of bullshit that are to much for me. As a last hope for my eboard dreams. I came here made an account. Got cookies. And now im hoping to meet nice ppl with info to share. I became homeless about 4 years ago and my old longboard has drove me everywhere to survive. My knees are starting to hurt sometimes. (It is still a regular longboard 5y old 300Euro quality) And i was hoping to upgrade. Thinking of money i looked at DIY since i have been maintaining my board and PC ever since i got it. As  i mentioned info is hard to get by these days with adds adds adds and more ppl trying to sell me shit i have no need of. Or promote things that suck for cold cash.

Besides my main story and the info needed for the mods to allow me more privilige. Here is my real question: 

Live in belgium. Its rainy sometimes. And i have switched my bearings on my board around 5 times cause of sand rain or rust. Built in motors are better against these surroundings. I barely have hills. I have been looking at maytech untill i found out the bearings couldnt be changed. So cheapest Diy set with replacable bearings and lowest price available. I saved 200Euros since im off the streets in about 2 months. And i give up trying to scounder google and youtube for tech info that the vids promise but never deliver.... Any help at all is much appreciated since im starting to give up... (I'm not above asking my envoriment for help tools info cheap spare or left over parts because money is still a very big issue in my life)  So ye having a 20 to 30km range with a minimum speed off 20 to 25km/hr would be ideal. Anyone that has a menu or chart that can allow me to gather parts for cheap solutions would be an absolute hero. I personally just dont have the money to experiment like some of you might have. Thx in advance.

Hello,
I am doing a electrical skateboard for the first time for a school project. Just got all my parts charged up the battery and connected the S6 conections on the ESC. When i turn on the ESC everything works fine, except for my hub motors. They just wont start running. Any possible solutions?![IMG_20190529_164431|666x500](upload://uAg1PMhV1oMEreqbmgj4MvZctCO.jpeg)

So I’m new to the forum, Great site.  I recently purchased a evolve carbon gt, and have to say I’m very dissatisfied with the board and the company.  Make long story short, my board malfunctioned after the first 5 rides due to condensation and moisture leaking into the deck.  The company refused to guarantee repair or replace the board.  After a long winded debate with evolve support and Affirm (finance) company, it was determined i was responsible for the damage which is #%*%.  Push comes to shove, I’m getting the board back.  Is there an easy DIY “kit” or recommended schematic that I could use to build and and upgrade the original carbon deck, trucks and wheels from the old board? I believe all the internal electronics and controllers have to be replaced. Motors are still functioning. Thank you in advance. #Disgruntled evolve client

You dont. Search for stuff closely related to what you need and read for a while. Once you will have been on the site for a certain amount of time your account will upgrade itself and allow you to use all the features available. In the meanwhile I'm sure youll have someone in this worldly forum who has already had your problem or question and got answered by one of our God DIYers :)

Hey new to this forum, got put on to esk8 from some friends that i have been flying drones with for a while. i have been doing drone and 3d print stuff for a while now so i understand a lot of the stuff going on. I jumped in without doing enough research and ended up buying The 11" truck 8" tires kit from diyeboards with the 10s5p battery. After riding it for a little while i noticed it would slow down pretty hard after mildly hard riding and felt like the esc were over heating. One of my friends had upgraded to vesc6.6 and gave me his 2 old hglrc vesc 4.12 esc and gave me his old remote/rx and bluetooth that went with it. installed it all in and the board was like a new beast. but when i was riding it just cut out and i went flying. thinking it was the battery bms cutting out my friend told me to lower the limits so i lowered amp limits all the way around but it still does it. granted it has only done it maybe 4 times in about 50 miles. The things i want to try are.
- ReWire battery to bypass the bms.
-Get a new remote/rx because maybe its a signal loss.
Is rewiring the battery a bad idea to do? i believe the are samsung 20q but i have not opened it yet. I dont think the battery is the issue becasuse on my bluetooth app it says i never pull more then 30a from the battery even at max and that shouldnt cut the bms out. atleast i dont think it should. anyone have an idea where i should start?

Here's where I need some help, although please give me tips or suggestions on anything else.
diyesk8 sells a 12s2p battery for $330.00, it comes with a switch, battery meter, charger, and BMS... After looking around that seems like an oddly cheap deal so if anyone has any experience with these batteries please let me know how you like them. Here's the link :

I am planning on starting my first Electric skateboard build. Unfortunately I have little knowledge of how to do this (but I know the basics), and even less funding (i'm a broke teen) so I was wondering if anyone had any advice for me and or would like to donate to my cause. Thanks a lot!

When someone orders a custom board and the board is received damaged the correct. the ethical thing to do is return the board as the company requested;, not ride the damaged board, and when it fails make a video and trash the company. Ray Spencer Of ESK8fighclub and TAWORS Digital Magazine helped a member of his group bully and harass and defame the board company to try to get money or an additional board out of the company. This isn't ethical behavior. This kind of bullying harassment makes boarders look like thugs. I personally own two of the boards Ray Spencer is purposely trashing. Momentum boards is a new company. They have great product and exceptional customer service. They don't deserve the lies and harassment Ray Spencer has been giving them.

I’m kinda new on this E-sk8 stuff. Is there any way to build an e-sk8 with direct wire controls. Is there a way to replace remote control with a potentiometer that’s directly wired to the ESC, or rather just potentio-battery-motor.

You would have to use a brushed motor, which doesn't require phase control. Not really practical for e-skate and you would have no brake. . Motor would be big too.
