Having an extra belt doesn't solve the problem of having brakes until you stop rolling.  Dual does kick ass for braking and redundancy reasons.

Yes!

If I had spare belts at home I would just cut the belts off on the side of the road

the unnecessary load on secondary focbox can leave you with... no focboxes
cutting belt is smart

I only broke a belt once and it was because of a misaligned pulley install. I don't think I would carry a belt on my pocket ever

The fastest way I've ever seen belts break is going through deep snow.  The snow gets on the pulleys and makes them bigger around like a snowball rolling down a hill.  You can snap two within a few meters

I run a single drive right now (broke a motor can from kicking a rock up into it and can't find replacement magnets or can) and my belt went bald because the TB motor mount came loose (despite loctite) and yea... luckily I always have my tools and 3 spare belts in my pack at all times I was able to swap the belt and get home... ALWAYS keep spares with you lol if u run dual motors keep 2 or 3 just in case

It was a 6374 190kv Torque Boards running a 4255m15 belt on a 14x72 gear. The belt was a little tweaked and stretched in a section....I kept running at it shredded. I have a few more belts on order.... I just disconnected the XT 60 to the motor and running single wheel...works but you can really feel the difference in the torque.

Yep that is the motor I am using on the dual setup.  This is a mountain board setup with 8 inch wheels.  The difference is significant between dual and single.

Yea it is but I just bought some six shooter rims and some new bushings so I can't buy a motor replacement yet, plus I'm not buying from TB anymore so I'm most likely buying a BKB motor

The one I use is aluminum and fits 10s5p, 2Focbox and the normal wiring.  I went aluminum for extra precaution.  Already scraped the front on a drop in from a parking lot.
