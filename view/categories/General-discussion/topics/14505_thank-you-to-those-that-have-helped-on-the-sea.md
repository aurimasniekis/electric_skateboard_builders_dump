I'm reading thru this forum while on a cruise. I can't thank several of you enough for answering my questions. I bought a metro board, from IIlan, to ride while I learn what it takes to build my ultimate board. I plan on building a low stance dual motor setup. The comoradarie here is amazing!!! Here's  pic of my view this morning. Stay tuned!!!<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/b/7/b7f556645773863db4c8e467a516344c5bf0a04d.JPG" width="500" height="500">

I've never been on a cruise but other than looking at the view, which is awesome, all I can think to do would be eating, drinking, laying in the hot tube and planning for doing something when I return. Which it seems you're doing. Maybe get a lot of reading in

Mmm, hot tube...:laughing:

I'd be spending most of my time on the wave machine, if they had one.

All men want to get in the hot tube. Tehe.  I'd be on the wave machine the whole time and wishing I really could be waterskiing off the back.

Lol. I thought that was code for spending "quality" time with your lady, and not leaving the cabin.

Since my post was flagged for no being appropriate....and the topic was posted in a general formu where my intent was to thank secrete people personally ... can someone explain to me why this posted was flagged by several people??? I've tried to follow the link provided as to why, but bling nothing specific. This is rather strange.

lol I was on a scuba vacation reading thru the forum and wanted to thank several of the guys ..,.i guess that's not a general "topic". Again great group here I hope it's not literally going to be policed in a way that posting is difficult to accurately list. Live and learn.
