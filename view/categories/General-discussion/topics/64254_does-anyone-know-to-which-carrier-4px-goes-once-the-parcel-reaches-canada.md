I ordered my FOCBOX long ago and recently on the 31 of July it was marked as Arrival at Destination, and now it's about 8 days later and still nothing updated. I contacted Enertion and they said to call Canada Post because it shouldn't take this long, so I did but Canada Post said we don't work with 4PX so by any chance does anyone know which carrier in Canada that 4PX goes to? Thank you for your help in advance.

Same thing is happening to my nano-x right now... arrival at destination means its in the process of getting through customs. From what I've read you might get the package to your door step without having any further updates on tracking. Shipping times from china are never the same... all depends on customs

Enertion said it's already cleared through Customs last week and should be delivered within 1-3 days. it's been a week after they said that
