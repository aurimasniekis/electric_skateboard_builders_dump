Well... "Today happened, what I was sure never could happen with me..." @Andy87

I came home after a long day and opened my mailbox to find the last item to build my battery. I became super excited and without thinking further I began. The biggest mistake you can probably do.
1. You are really excited and don't think about what you do.
2. You are not focusing on what you are doing.

I went straight out to my spot welder and began.

Well the first spot welds were quite good but then the second pack was were everything went wrong.

![IMG_3273|666x500](upload://kVy9Dq26AkPuRM6G2OlFXisqsjR.JPG)

I clicked the button and I think I held it down for too long because there came a lot of sparks out of by battery. After that I looked at my battery and saw some blue stuff.
Im really fucking pissed at myself for being stupid. IT IS STUPID. REALLY STUPID! NOT JUST A MISTAKE! But im also really happy that the battery didn't explode. Imagine what could had happened if the battery started burning... Because I was so excited I didn't have my fire extinguisher next to me...

What I wanna say is that BE CAREFUL! These batteries are fucking dangerous and you should really focus on what you are doing. Be prepared and sit down for a minute before you begin and think of all possible things that can go wrong so you are prepared. Batteries are dangerous if not handled correctly. Be careful and learn from others mistakes. I didn't so learn from me.

It's actually kinda inappropriate to post this because two days ago I made a thread about battery safety :joy:

Jokes aside: BATTERIES ARE NOT TOYS! BE CAREFUL!

And while you are here: Do you think I can remove the destroyed battery from my pack and replace it with a new one or is it too dangerous?

Did you hold the Spot welder Tips like this  |   |
OR this    \   / while you were welding?

Remove the broken cell, measure the IR of the healthy ones and check if they have the same or as a new one. Maybe the two others got damaged too. If they Match with a new cell just replace the broken one otherwise replace All three cells.

That hole is the result of there not being enough pressure on the nickel to keep it in enough contact with the cell can.

If you notice,you tried welding it right next to the heat shrink line. You're going to have to press REALLY hard there to get the proper contact because there's a plastic wedge working against you. Next time stay in the center area.

Maybe it is also about the wrong Spot welding angle. The spark goes into the cell instead of going/pointing to the other Spot Welder tip

It is recommended to Spot weld with a flat angle. Even **More** than 45¬∞

Internal resistance. I can measure it with my Hobby charger. The lower the IR the more amp the battery can produce and vice versa (the higher the IR the less amp the battery can produce)

don't expect peak performance if you do. Reusing cells often results in shortened lifespan for the whole pack.

Man that exactly why I said in the past to add an Arduino to it. You can not rely on your finger since you won't be constant over the time. I ran several test before make my battery pack and with the spot welder I built I get constant nice results with two pulse of 50ms and 100ms respectively. It's impossible that you press so fast and moreover constant for hundreds of time.  During testing 250ms pulse was already way to long with my set up.

So you have three reasons that Individually or combined resulted in this behaviour.
1. Manual Button
2. Wrong Spot welding angle 
3. Space between nickel and the battery

What exactly affects peak performance? The fact that it was previously welded? They have zero charge cycles right?

theres a lot of cells sold on endless-sphere that are not used but with weld marks.  i dont know why or where he gets them from but he sells a huge amount and they show not to have any reduced capacity.  the weld shouldnt do anything.  it doesnt heat the cell noticeably.

I just edited my last Post to make it more clear.

A Spot weld shouldnt do any harm. Thats why we are Spot welding.
Lhb just meant that the Pack wont reach peak Performance with this damaged cell

A bit? If you are on a budget. I know @darkkevind does it and I don't think he have had any problems. I agree it's a bit sketchy after this experience. Have to go and read about audrino timers to make it work better.

Just something I thought of. Nothing of this is facts. Just a theroy.

The 2 welding tips is pretty identical but one of them is a bit longer and probably bigger (can't remember). What have happend might have been that one of the tips had more power go through and made a bigger impact.
In 1st weld one of the "dots" in the nickel strip is much bigger than the other. In 2nd weld is there also a much bigger "dot" right above the other big "dot". That means one of the welding tips might be the problem?

You didn't have the electrodes properly connected to the nickel and you therefore created a very high current arc. That's what blew a hole in your cell.

Be very careful that they are both touching the nickel firmly before clicking that button! Click that button super-quick too!

Take a look at my demonstration video... You'll see how long to click for... It's literally on and off immediately.

It's a problem of contact. I was also surprise how much pressure you need to apply to assure a good connection. To run test use a nickel strip and a cutter blade. I read it mimics the real situation. Anyhow really put a firmly pressure with your hand when welding and you will see that it won't happen anymore. Anyhow I said before I really suggest to attach an Arduino. It is so cheap and makes your life a lot easier. I can give you the script that I used and then you would need to adjust to your system power (you need to adjust the pulses time). Although the code it's really easy I based on the led script present in the Arduino library. You will only need to connect the Arduino to a switcher that opens and close the circuit when the Arduino gives the stimuli starting from your momentary button or pedal. I can post also the Arduino connections so you will only need to reproduce them. Load the program and adjust the time in the program. That's it :wink:

Edit: moreover I see form the picture you posted that most of the welds went through the nickel strips. So you are applying the current for to long. Which is normal by hand. In this way even if you  don't get the burnt spots, the connections between the battery and nickel strips are gonna be too weak.
Last edit. When I set the system these were the welds I got. Really strong.

I took the whole pen apart and now I have two wires with copper tips. This way and the old way doesn't work good enough. I have to get some Arduino in the system. I'm 90% sure I'll just get the Arduino spot welder but it's a bit pricey. What Arduino do I need to use that script you got?

Your welds looks much cleaner. How much is the timer set to?

I have several arduino and I use the Arduino uno pro but that comes a bit pricey. Just get a arduino nano, the script will work too. On Ali is at 2-3 $ but takes time. A bit more you will get from where you leave. Nano V3 ATmega328/CH340G, Micro USB, Pin headers NOT soldered. Compatible for Arduino Nano V3.0
 http://s.aliexpress.com/nQr6vayq?fromSns=Copy to Clipboard
You also need a switcher which I had it but it will cost a bit more. Locally you can buy from Rc component for like 20 euro, otherwise for less I guess from Ali

Basically just pins front he output and the 5V line with a resistor. I don't remember what I used but I think 5Koh resistor but I will check. The Arduino is powered by an power bank. It is a separate circuit that just send the signal to close the circuit at the switcher level following the script you loaded. Then the switcher is connect it to the spot welder as the momentary button. The momentary button need to be connect Tot the Arduino.
![IMG_20180220_182337|690x388](upload://ysjNrKjJyh19VfhWaxuPJ367LO0.jpg)
In the picture you see a button directly connect to the spot welder, is because I kept both the option. There is actually another button connect to the pin 13 on the Arduino. I will take better picture when back from holiday next week.

Think you just made me 99% sure on what to do. Think I'll just get the Arduino spot welder and do the diy Arduino another time. It's going to take me some time to get into the making and parts, have to order, forgot to order something, gets everything. At least 2 weeksis spent on that. I can get the Arduino spot welder next week and be ready to go.

But thanks for the really good instructions and help. Right now I really just want to finish my board and ride and not wait 3 more weeks.

I perfectly understand man. Just we aware that the Arduino spot welder is not perfect too and actually you will need to get it right too, such as time, pressure ecc... If you read in the thread a lot people have a overheating problem due to the small size of the spot welder ecc, so you need to stop in between session... I hope it will be faster, but at the point you are to me it's faster use your diy one. I am sure your system when optimized will work way better and without overheating problem. You can actually buy arduino spot welder circuit already made from Ali too. Anyhow if you get the Arduino and the switcher locally you will be ready next week. The installation part takes 10-15 minutes. Most of the work is make the spot welder not connect two pins on the Arduino, believe me.

Ah ok this one is a good one. I thought you were talking about the one sold in the forum. Something like the Boss Arduino spot welder...the one you point I think you can actually change the pulse duration live using the knobs and the display which is nice.
