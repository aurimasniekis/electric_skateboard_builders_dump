To be clear i'm referring to GOOD armored hoodies with kevlar exteriors so they don't rip apart the instant they hit pavement. Like this one for $150

https://www.revzilla.com/motorcycle/merlin-brampton-kevlar-hoody

However speaking of sliding, I've been thinking a jacket may be better for very low friction on pavement, are there jackets designed specifically to slide super easily?

(i did actually repost this to the esk8 subreddit as well)

Personally, I think that a good set of gloves and kneepads are the best bang for your buck eskating. Elbow pads if you're gonna be going faster like 25+. That's just me tho. If you feel like you need armored clothes for riding an eboard, maybe look into dialing your setup to be more stable or just waiting til you get better balance to go fast. I always have riden with just a helmet, although I should pick up some gloves that will work with a remote so if I fall I don't rip up my hands.

fellow in the discord recently took a spill at 12mph and his elbow hit his board on the way down, fractured it rather badly, might lose range of motion on his arm.

i'd rather have SOME padding than not, and something really quick to put on or take off is best

Well than get some elbow and knee pads. Try to find ones that are flattened instead of rounded because a round one will roll when you hit the ground

I'm rocking these for the summer

https://www.revzilla.com/motorcycle/speed-and-strength-rust-and-redemption-armored-moto-shirt

So far so good. has elbow, shoulder and back pads. I did a few low speed falls, really eased the pain on elbows and shoulders.

I also use Mechanix m-pact gloves (good dexterity, still has some armor), and thick cargo shorts which have kept knees somewhat safe. I'd like some hip and tailbone protection, but it's too much for mixed commute.

And helmet.

I'm looking at the hoodies, but unless the material is pretty firm, I'm worried the pads will move around a lot. The flannel shirt actually keeps things locked in pretty good. The partial kevlar is much lighter, nicer for summer. The full kevlar ones have another lining layer, heavy, sweaty.

If you get knee/elbow pads, get ones that are designed to slide.

Hmm well I wear knee/shin pads and a motor cycle jacket and a helmet. I don't wear gloves but I fall on my padded forarms instead of my hands cause that's how you break wrist.

As far as getting armor it's not a good idea to discourage people from doing that @Deckoz is a more experienced skater than most people on this forum he gears up more than most but one day you will see the reason to our madness when you have to do a superman slide at 40mph with the only protection of that nice cotton shirt.

BTW my motorcycle jacket offers no chest protection and I already broke a rib falling on my arm once lol

My jacket is a Bilt it's cheap but I did upgrade the back protector to an apline star one. I like this jacket for the summer because it's super breathable and protects your arms shoulders and back.

well if you have kneepads then fall on those first, then on your hands. personally I'm never really going fast enough on my eboard where I would not be able to take a step or 2 to break my fall. (my board tops out at around 25) I will say that when I do downhill skating I rarely go without kneepads and gloves, and elbow pads if its a more gnarly/fast/technical hill. it maybe be important to note that I've never fallen on my eboard, though I have definitely gotten some road rash and bruises in downhill crashes. lastly I'd like to say that I'm **not** discouraging anyone from safety gear, but in the title it did ask for peoples opinions and I just didn't think an armored shirt would be worth my own money.

Most of us run 107s especially the faster boards but I do have a 6 shooter set up that I run sometimes but I do like my 107s. It's not crazy expensive actually the Board I took to meet @longhairedboy in Orlando did 44mph on the radar gun with his son riding it down the street and it only cost me $1300 but I took my time and looked for deals. 

 High pitched noise was the drone.

BTW if you ever hit up Orlando head over to Winter Park they have the most amazing bike trails away from cars with super smooth roads and alot of Twisties.

It's not bad if you can be patient and wait for deals on stuff and jumping on them as soon as you see them. 

I use all kinds of decks, wheels and even pnumatics i never felt bothered by the hight sure it makes it a little harder or awkward to kick push but you really don't want to be kick pushing much on an esk8 anyway.

I broke my shoulder, collarbone, and ribs on a nasty fall going 21 mph. Board slid from under me on a carve because I hit some debris on the side of the bike path. I was wearing a helmet and gloves for protection and luckily all jeans outfit or I‚Äôd have had road burn too. 

Now I ride full armor except for butt/hip padding. I have that too but I am not that pleased with it yet for heat.

![image|265x500](upload://okYDrQgZtmHyiSUnPX4nAPyNtDu.jpeg)

I ride like this every time now. Also before my max speed was 22mph on meepo hubs. With the torque drive on 12s I‚Äôm going 32mph. 

I‚Äôm pretty sure riding this way would‚Äôve prevented my trip to the hospital.

Kevlar shirts are good. But pads are better. And both together make amazingness happen.

- I don't condone Kevlar shirts or hoodies with built in pads.
- built in pads are leathers only , otherwise you risk them moving.

This is apparently what all the cool kids are wearing while riding their wipper snippers and very good gear but pricey.  What price do you put on safety though?  My full bike get up is way more expensive than my best board but I already had all that so no pain.  I only ever fall off when I'm not wearing it though.  :roll_eyes:

I have a Dainese Air Flux D1 motorcycle jacket, I have taken a couple of spils and it has held up fine.

https://www.skroutz.gr/s/6471927/Dainese-Air-Flux-D1-Tex-Black.html

Greece is really hot this time of year and this has all the ventilation you need. As long as you keep moving you are golden.

One thing I learned is never to put anything in the pocket on the side of your front foot (I ride goofy so that is the right pocket for me) as:
a. Whatever is in there will gouge into your skin
b. The jacket will rip at that place (easy fix with some needle and thread though)

i'm strongly considering getting a decent armored kevlar hoodie then upgrading the pads to D3O pads since they're a very, very good material

If your not super fancy, theres always the option to buy some solid pants and reinforce the knees with some kevlar (pay an tailor), it looks cool and I did that on my pants for dirt biking
I fell like 10times and everything had holes ripped except the kevlar :D

i'll admit, like 50% of the reason i got it is because of the denim look
the other 50% being the removable liner which is an entire hoodie on its own. vent ports, lots of pockets, D3O back elbow and shoulder pads

sort of review.
although starting off, turns out the medium is too big, the elbows flop way too much for my tastes

The vintage black looks very little like the photos, more of a slightly distressed grey than faded blue

lotsa pockets but they're rather small

the internal hoodie line thing is actually an EXTREMELY comfy hoodie in its own right

i'm a little worried that if i go for a small it'll be too tight, but i guess i'll find out

https://photos.app.goo.gl/uC29Py9RfkSseQX9A

Anyway, small is on the way. if it ends up being too small, i think i'll return it, keep the medium, and get thicker elbow pads to "fill out" the elbow area

Now that we have seen some higher quality protective clothing I'd like to flip the table around and ask if anyone has experience with cheaper solutions such as the "motorcycle full body armor jacket" you can cop many variations of them for ~$35 on ebay. I doubt it can offer very good protection but it's hard to resist trying it out at that price. Why not buy something cheap while you save up for something nice?

You know what? I think I will purchase it and let you know what I think.

I have just picked up a cheap/old stock armoured jacket, its a 2016 Shot that i paid ¬£50 for, originally ¬£180 :wink:  if you shop around you can get good but cheap ones. 

![Shotjacket|666x500](upload://13cdPZQO3cQYX4dD9lFqNUya1Uk.jpg)


My opinions just from wearing it (without a crash test).

It's a tad over complicated to put on but its well fitting, warm (that's both good and bad), the mobility is very good, and i feel like its going to save me probably more than once, as i will be using bindings so im expecting some hard falls that i cant roll or slide out of.

My Chinesium "jacket" arrived last night. It's slightly too small which I'm disappointed with but then again I didn't measure myself and just got the medium size since it's what I wear is T-shirt sizes. Still waiting on my arm to heal up so I haven't got any real world experience with it but it seems to bend in all the right places and the pads seem big enough to cover all the important bits. 

There's not much support or protection other than the soft plastic shell pads but I'd hazard a guess it's good enough to reduce or prevent road rash and skin abrasions of that nature. Although they're not hard and secure they might even help with sliding instead of grabbing the ground when I inevitably fall.

Could do with much more padding. I'll post pics tonight
