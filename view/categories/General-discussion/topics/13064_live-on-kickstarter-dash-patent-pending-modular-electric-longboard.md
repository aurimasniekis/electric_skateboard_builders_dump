[Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/703584336/1911017153?token=e6ce8429)Hey Guys!

So I've been working on an eSk8 business for awhile now and we're about 1 week away from launching on Kickstarter. I wanted to give you the heads up to ask questions and give you some details on what we're building and why. 

Our company is called Dash Electric, can be found on Facebook or www.DashElectric.com

I'm a huge fan of the DIY community and our product reflects that(will cover that more later).

But the quick rundown is that we have an electronics package including hub motors that can be mounted to most longboards. We also are offering pre assembled boards, a short board with a kicktail and a 40" drop through with our kits ranging from $500-650 and our completes ranging from $650-800. 

Battery: We use LFP batteries and we put them in a beautiful anodized aluminum enclosure(think macbook aluminum) that not only protects the cells from road grime and water but also can contain a fire in the unlikely event of a fire. Our pack is also hot swappable, no screws to undo. 

Remote: We have a 2.4Ghz remote that is in an anodized aluminum housing. It comes with different rider modes to help teach new riders. Our beginner mode is REALY easy to use, we made it so you can press full forward on the throttle and the board accelerates smoothly and slowly. You can also hold back on the remote to engage the motor brakes to help hold the board in place as you get on. We also smooth the braking in beginner mode. 

Motor: I worked with Jacob awhile back to help design/fund the hub motors in their early stages. Dash has already addressed the tire slipping issue and we are sealing our motors, and including sensors as standard. Really wonderful motors and can't wait to ship them. Hub motors are so smooth and require pretty much no maintenance which is really great for commuting.

ESC: We have our own ESC that we are planning to use, however, if the VESC 6 turns out to be better and is reliable we will likely offer that as well (and will of course donate to Vedder) 

Options: So headlights and tail lights are standard, but our offerings will be either a single or dual motor.

So the DIY community is near and dear to my heart and as a company we don't want to exclude the DIY community from progress that is made through a funded company, so our product is fully modular. That means every component is user swappable, all the way down to the wireless receiver. So once we are launched we will be selling parts of the board separately so that you can have a tested battery pack and hook up your own ESC, receiver, and motor if you'd like! 

This sort of user accessibility into the product also lets us create improved parts over time and you can upgrade components without buying a new board. Eboards are expensive and we want to help keep you on the most up to date tech without breaking the bank!

I'd love to answer any other questions you guys have but we're really excited to launch!

We're really interested in engaging new riders, particularly 18-34yr old urban commuters who maybe haven't considered esk8s in the past. From our polling one of the number one complaints we received from people about why they don't skate to work is that they feel unprofessional bringing a skateboard to the office. So we're packaging dash in aluminum with a no graphics bamboo deck. No belts to collect dirt and grime. So this results in a really sleek professional board that you can be proud to carry in to work or class!

Sure! What would you like to know?

For our pack it's 12S1P A123 LFP cells with a BMS. This lets us have a pack we can charge super quickly and safely and still get 1000+ charge cycles from. Also as the pack drains you don't get any reduced power as the cells are capable of 70A constant and 140A bursts.

That's a photo!

The top speed definitely depends on weight but 22mph seems to be where it tops out. We just want it to be powerful enough to take you up hills and be able to pass the occasional cyclist :smiley: We'll make more powerful motors down the line that can be swapped in for the speed freaks but these motors suit beginners and experienced riders really well!

Range is always a tricky subject but we're looking at 7-10 mile range depending on rider weight, terrain, and riding style. Top speed is around 22mph, we're still dialing specs on the motor so I don't want to advertise a false wattage so I'll get back to you on that. But 80A for the wheels!

So with the 12s1p and hub motors I assume you are controlling the speed since your selling it right? 
Any more info on those decks?

## \#10 Posted by: TheRedPanda Posted at: 2016-11-14T23:15:59.402Z Reads: 258

Yep! We are limiting the current from the pack to keep the pack happy and the motors from drawing more current than they can handle. 

To keep manufacturing costs and risks down we're partnering with a deck manufacturer(not a brand name) to make some pretty nice bamboo decks with moderate flex. We'll have more photos on this with the kickstarter page!

Nice. Last question. :sweat_smile:
What makes your product better or more unique over other very similar products such as EON?
```

## \#12 Posted by: TheRedPanda Posted at: 2016-11-14T23:25:41.527Z Reads: 244

```
Quick note on something i didn't mention above. We actually designed our pack to be front wheel drive. This helps encourage riders to keep their weight over the front axle which promotes stability at speed and increases traction. It also lets us have headlights and tail lights built into the package.


So Eon seems like a nice product, their standard battery can only handle 20A which in my experience is not enough power to handle living in a hilly area, so you need to run their double pack to hit 40A which drives up the cost.

We really want to keep things simple for new riders so our base model is plenty powerful for most people, and a dual for those that live in hilly areas.  Our pack charges very quickly and we use LFP which is the safest high power battery out there. Our price range of 500-800 is fairly wallet friendly as well and over time as we develop improved parts you only will need to spend a small fraction of that to get the newest motors, batteries, or ESC.

Personally from speaking with people the aluminum housing / sleek design is really responding well with commuters who want something clean to take into work or class and is one of my favorite aspects of the product.

For a complete longboard our price is $650 for a single motor, and $800 for a dual motor. For kids I would probably recommend the single motor. :slight_smile: We also offer 2 different deck lengths, so the smaller of the 2 is a bit easier to carry around.

Cool.  Thanks for sharing. I like how you are keep things open and modular. That's what is keeping me away from buying a pre-made board.  If it breaks, I can't easily fix it.

Just a general question for you and the people on here.  Do we really think that swappable battery packs are the future?  Remember how batteries used to be swappable on most cell phones, laptops, etc. and now they are all integrated.  Is anyone really going to carry a second heavy battery pack around with them.  If I want more range I'm just going to build a big battery like the 10s4p 26650 I'm working on now!

This looks very promising! Price is crazy good, if you think that a yuneec ego would cost the same and be way worse, specs wise. If I hadn't taken  the diy route I would probably have considered one of these, also seeing that you consider the diy community and not just random hipster folks in kickstarter. Let's see how it ends up, I may recommend it to somebody

Oh that's awesome! 

Our single motor kit is $500
Our Dual motor is $650

All she needs is to have the standard 4 hole mounting pattern on the deck and it'll fit perfectly.

```
At some point (I hope) batteries will likely have enough range and charge fast enough to make swappable packs obsolete. But from surveying and our own testing, there's certain commutes that are on the edge of the range either from straight distance or you made some detours and if you need to then immediately turn around and go back having a swappable pack makes a HUGE difference. The way we designed the enclosure tooling lets us make different size battery packs with no change in manufacturing costs so we'll have larger packs as well ;)

So technically you could mount it on the rear but the headlights and tail lights would be facing the wrong way but it would work.

We will eventually have an AWD Dash but that requires some additional R&D to get it working the way we want it to.

Personally I do think they are the future..short term future...but I agree that eventually battery technology will increase to the point that multiple batteries are not necessary. For now though, there are situations where a lot of people will want to have a spare to pop in, myself and @SeanHacker included. I find it super useful on the Raptor with only a 10s3p (and corresponding compartment). 

These commercial boards arent custom designed for everyones specific range desires like a DIY is, so selling spares as well as designing easily swappabe components will be a plus in the near term

For me, not so.much carrying a spare battery but having one  in the board and one charging means no down time if I wanna ride all day. Very cool. 

I'm interested in the forward facing drive as well.  I kind of think forward balance could be bad in hit conditions but I'd givebit a shot.  (Glad spell check caught that...shot that is :)

it seems not very unique, have just taken Jacob hub motor direct from china factory. This is probably going to be a big problem for them due to all the problems with those motors.

I didn't flag it. But I can address the concern. 

The previous motors' primary problem was the urethane slipping, which we've already found a solution for. brushless motors like these are very simple, as long as the components are of good quality and the tolerances stay within what we allow them to be the motors are absolutely great. 

I would address other concerns but @plastikado458 only specified "all the problems" which doesn't give me a whole lot to work with.

Same here, looks really promising. 

Please don't take this the wrong way:
I have backed many Kickstarter campaigns, most have been successful. The ones I see fail are the ones who have too many options, it ends up being to much to handle if it really takes off. That being said, the single and dual is a great idea, and needed. The deck length is what I would change, I would have one standard board so you can raise the quantity and lower the price. But in the end it's not up to me, I just want to see you be successful. I hope you don't take that the wrong way, I just speak from experience backing Kickstarters.

```
Very valid concerns! What's so great about the way everything is designed is that all of the components on the single and dual are the same aside from the extra ESC and Motor so that really boosts our quantities. And our decks are very simple so we have the price at a really nice place for production so the 2 decks only change the size of the packaging around it! 

There is always a risk we may run into some crazy unexpected manufacturing problem that could kill us but since day 1 we've kept manufacturability as one of the top priorities and is part of the reason why it's taken us until now to launch. We've had working product for quite awhile but we wanted to make sure everything is including the manufacturing is scalable and easy to implement.

It's only how you spec the winding in the factory to be wound wye or delta. The problem was that FOC on the VESC wasn't able to reliably drive the big hubs. So it wasn't that the motors couldn't handle it.

```
My mistake, the conversation in that thread was about high voltage affecting the VESC. How that plays into big hubs is that to get to a nice top speed of around 20mph you need to have a higher voltage than you would if it was geared down with a belt and pulley system. My knowledge base is primarily around mechanical components, but from what I've found the increased voltage + faster switching in FOC was pushing the VESC's limits therefore causing a less reliable system than if the VESC was designed specifically for that kind of application.
```

## \#58 Posted by: Hummie Posted at: 2016-11-16T19:09:30.752Z Reads: 121

```
 a typically hub motor has a lower kv and therefore less electrical switching necessary.  if the vesc's components were specd for a higher voltage than now the vesc and motor could do 100 volts no problem as the erpm of the vesc is way higher than needed with 90kv or 70kv or whatever number around there.  think the limit is 8600 erpm max.  kv times volts times 7 determines the erpm the vesc will hit.

No matter the technology getting better, imo it looks much cleaner to have a rack for your boards and hidden cords for your Battery pack to sit in a nice stand and charge or docking bay. :)  Imagine how sweet that could look to have the battery back on a glowing charge dock and the boards nice and neat on the wall with no cords hanging around.

Maybe I missed it but what are you patenting? Just curious, is it the modular battery design?

It's the same price! The only difference is stickers and first to ship!

We have a patent pending on the way all the components come together and the way it's mounting to the board. While eon(spain) was first to launch with a similar design we already had the design created and was in the process of developing the patent for the US which is a first to file. So we'll need to talk to eon if/when the patent goes through about US sales.

Just seeing this, looks great!  To get clarify, the only difference between the dual hub kit versus complete is the deck for additional $150?

Yeah I feel very bad for Jacob. He got screwed in everyday possible. Hopefully your hubs can give him some redemption!

Jacob's Hubs can do FOC - in the booklet I got when buying them it even said that Vedder personally had the motors to test and recommended to use different shunts to increase resolution.
Personally I am not going to risk it though - heard too many bad stories about fried DRV chips.

We're not stealing his design. I have talked with since the first gen motors, we gave him quite a lot of funding to help continue development as well as rights to improve the designs ourselves :stuck_out_tongue:

We're not patenting anything around the motors as brushless hubs are all too similar to patent right now. Our patent is around the rest of Our design

We actually helped fund jacobs design awhile back, and with his consent we are using his motors and are improving the designs for our own use

You guys should stop talking trash without knowing a thing. He mentioned his work WITH JACOB in the first post, they know each other and he also helped him. Just cause you have "the best hub motor esk8" that doesn't mean everybody else is just stealing stuff from poor people. At least read the first post, before commenting

Isn't @Jacob even working at Enertion? So @onloop should know. Without Jacob personally saying something about this I'll keep being sceptical.

I have a very long email thread and have had multiple long phone calls with with him so I can assure you I'm not lying. Did you read my first post where I said I care about the DIY community? I wouldn't rip off jacob's design, particularly without giving him any compensation. I contacted him a long time ago and I shared with him that I wanted to help further the design of the motor in any way that I can, and that I didn't want to "purchase" the design and keep it away from the community, I've always been on Jacob's side to keep the motors available to anyone. And we will be selling our version of the motors separately from the boards to keep the goal of making esk8s accessible for everyone.

Also, how stupid would one be saying false things about a user that may easily see this post, who knows personally many people that are reading this? If he was lying he would just say "that's not Jacob's design" 
You don't have to be negative about everything
