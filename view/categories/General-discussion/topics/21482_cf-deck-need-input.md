So I as starting to lean towards offering complete boards instead of having people bring me a deck and just adding my trucks, enclosures , mounts and generic remotes vescs and sk3 motors. I have a replacement for my 3d printed mounts figured out as many may know. Now I am working on a deck.
The deck will be bigger than most of you prefer but people I sell them to dont really care about the size more about going far fast and safe.
My decks will be made of carbon fiber an have room for 4 vescs and batteries up to 12s8p while I am currently  researching having 12s5-6p made.
