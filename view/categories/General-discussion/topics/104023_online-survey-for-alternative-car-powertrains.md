Hi guys,

a friend of mine tries to do her master thesis on prospective future powertrains in cars via an online survey. I thought that the people here are perfectly suited for this kind of topic as we tend to be very into electric mobility, technology and innovation in general.
Hope you don't mind me posting this and look forward to what you have to say about this.

I’d be happy to discuss your opinions as well - I can’t see the results of the survey but am very interested in what you have to say. 
I started the same topic in the "new" forum ;) so come and join the discussion there!
