```
With 6S, you should target at 260kv motor and 16/36 gear ratio.

```
Then go with 10S battery and 16/36.
Or you can keep the reduction ratio, but then, you will need to go with 12S battery.

If it has plenty of tork you can up your wheel size or motor gear

```
If you don't need extreme torque, 15/36 is usually pretty good. Since you have 18 on the motor, around 39/40 might be a good fit.

those are the wheels I have for my build, but I have a 130kv motor 3200 watts at 80 amps, 15t/36t gear drive set up . those wheels were chosen for the rough roads around my area anything smaller and id end up ass over tea kettle and prolly break my ear lol. but ur gearing is way way off imo remember its my opinion..i am not perfect nor do I know everything lol. I know nothing except having fun without twisting my baby toe in a crash .

25 is fast enough to begin with as a start, if you hit a pole at 25 straight on you're done.
