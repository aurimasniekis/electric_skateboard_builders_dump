 I find I am using my electric mountain board primarily for pavement and loving it. Currently I have the off-road 8 inch tires and they are providing a very comfortable ride. Wondering what others have had experience with the MBS roadie tires. Have you felt a significant  difference in  acceleration or ride feel? I'm assuming I will get better mileage due to less resistance.

Looks like I will have to go with these. Shipping from trampa to usa is expensive. <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/0/1/019a8f15e0131b826f7fb2bcf199d0a8bf13573f.PNG" width="281" height="499">
