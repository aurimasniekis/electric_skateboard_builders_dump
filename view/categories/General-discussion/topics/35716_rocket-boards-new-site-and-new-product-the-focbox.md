Rocket Boards is proud to announce the launch of our new site, at [rocket-boards.com](http://www.rocket-boards.com/)!

We are starting to grow, and as such, we need to stock more parts. After a year now of testing, we are confident that the FOCBOX is best ESC for electric skateboards. 

WE HAVE FOCBOX's IN STOCK NOW! With 2 day shipping from San Francisco to the west coast, you get your focbox quickly! 3 day shipping to the rest of the continental US!

We are working on remotes, power switches, hollow core decks, and hummies hub motors still, and will offer these products in the near future!

We're getting new samples shipped Friday, should be here early next week. Still not in agreement on the wind. I'm convinced 15 turns of 19 awg in the delta termination would be best, while hummie believes the 8 turner of 16 awg with the wye termination is best. I got my wind going, been waiting for him to get his going. Were not entirely sure if we are happy with the design we have in hand, as the new design fixes a few potential problems, and gives us a bit more space inside. This will make the sensor board possible, where as it is now, theres no space for sensors, not that you really need them, but they would help a little.

We most importantly want to make sure what we send is not going to have any problems. Right now for example, I have a slight rattle. This new design should hopefully get rid of this (the fact were using a new manufacturer should help too, the last one overcharged and was not very good).

We want a flawless product, but at some point, we need to call the gun and start shipping. Of the big three, none of them are problem free. It's really hard to get everything right on the first of a major redesign like the carvons, or completely new motor like the raptor 2s. Even though we are changing less, theres still some growing pains, especially since we didn't assemble the old little motors.

A few months ago, I would have said mounts, but that seems to have been mitigated. Maybe get in on developing that JTAG BMS and having it as a product availble. Dunno if that would make sense unless you were making batteries...

Aside, I like the new site. Very exited about the idea of being able to buy a hollow core wood deck. And very intrigued to see what's the deal with your hub motors. It'll be between yours and the V3's for my next build. Already thinking of ways to cyphon cash out of my account without my wife noticing...

lol, we are going. I will likely wind the rest of the motors we have with the 20 awg 15 turner. It works well, and I have no doubt these motors will last a long time, and are efficient and powerful. Hummie wants to optimize to the max, but I believe it could introduce new problems, especially with these first 18 motors (due to space restrictions).

I hope to wind the rest through out the next week, and I hope week can ship the first motors by the end of next week.

@evoheyax second that. Maybe we could work out some kind of import thing, or have the new DieBieMSs made in a joint effort to support the designer and get a decent BMS out there. And make a buck.

  I'm glad no one is freaking that I haven't sent motors yet as I don't even want to touch these parts laying around.    they are a huge pain to put together and I'd rather take a loss and send everyone this much better design coming.  one day maybe will make money.
 I'll have all the stators wound and wheels done before the main parts come in just over 3 weeks so they wil be out the door.  winding now.  down to an hour a stator and they look like gems.

How about kits for making a 10 or 12s Li ion battery without spotwelder (without cells). Some sort of cost effective kit (with instructions of course) that uses compression to connect paralleled 18650 cells in a slim form factor.  Maybe also include a low cost BMS for charging only, and plugs to connect to a laptop's power supply.

jake and i were trying to figure out some kind of modular pack system where the P groups just plug together then you plug it all into a BMS and its done. 4P and 5P groups each with a positive, negative, and fairly long balance lead. then all the accessories like volt meter and eswitches and hopefully the BMSs as well at some point.

With the FOCBOX's becoming popular/commonly used, maybe a anti vibration mounting system would be a seller, low profile compact with a heatsink/passive cooling and a touch of waterproofing are all things needed.

At this time i can only find one well designed foxbox mounting bracket by @JLabs, but as an example i really like @Nowind's DIY Vesc six case/solution something like that for the Focbox's would be a rather tempting option for those of use not able to make such things.

1. cut a small square of the silicone foam you get when you buy your motors. Make it the same size as the flat square section of the plastic housing on the focbox. 
2. Score the flat square section of the plastic housing on the focbox with low grit sandpaper, 60 or 80 will do.
3. Score the floor of the enclosure with the same grit. Blow off the dust and wipe it clean.
4. Plug in your hot glue gun and use a BLACK hot glue stick. Let the gun sit longer than it needs to to warm up. The glue will start to drip and collect under the tip. That's how you know its a bit hotter than it usually needs to be. You want it very runny and hot when you squeeze the trigger. 
5. make a glob of hot glue the size of a Skittle on the focbox where you scored it and  press the foam square into it. Immediately place it on a table foam side down and press the focbox down onto the foam and hold it for  one minute. 
6. Place another skittle sized glob of extra hot glue in the box where desired, then press the focbox foam side down into the glob and keep pressure on it for one minute.
7. let cool an additional 5 minutes. 

your focbox will be strongly bonded to your enclosure. The foam will rip before the glue will let go of either surface. the foam provides elevation for allowing wires to have room to be routed, vibrational damping, and an easy fastener free experience. it also allows the heatsink to float in the open air of the box. 

if you don't have a 3cm clearance or so in the box, you can use thinner foam padding. You can filet the motor foam fairly easy with an exacto or a sharp kitchen knife. A larger razor or razor saw would be ideal.

The more of you with affordable and adaptable battery solutions, the better (incl BMS's and chargers). In my opinion, there seems to be a rather large gap in North America for li ion power. Not knocking those who are already doing this, just probs wouldn't hurt to have moar. 
And for the love of pizza, somebody please start doing this in Canada! :upside_down:

I think the real issue is the laws around shipping batteries are grey...

At this point in time, I don't even know if I can ship a fully assembled 12s or 10s battery from inside the US to someone else in the US.

Batteries are the final piece in the puzzle for completes. We have board solution (similar to the raptor 2 but in long board form). Not what I personally want, but until I can get there, this will do fine.

Were looking into getting a resistance soldering iron. We can use copper strips instead of nickle. Mix that with cell level fusing, a good bms, and power switch, and your set.

I think batteries will be there at some point in the next few months. It's not a matter of if but when now.

Just did a copper strip pack and there is a difference in preformance heat wise, and effeciency wise, same exact parts in two individual packs except the copper strip pack was able to get 1.5-2 more miles, I dont spotweld it on though, ive seen too many spotwelded packs come in with broken tabs and ruin entire parallel packs, I find with a hot enough iron(can be expensive for a good one)you form a much stronger connection and are less prone to future issues.

Fedex. Get an account, use Ground or Home Delivery (which is ground) and print the labels yourself and drop them off at the closest hub. I ship batteries and fully assembled boards this way. I even shipped a carefully packaged unwrapped evolve pack back to the owner so they could puff it how they saw fit. 

Don't bother with USPS or UPS. I just shipped 645 watt hours to California yesterday.

It's a weird soldering iron that uses resistance to solder the cells.

As a result, we can use copper strips instead of nickle, and copper is just better electrically than nickle.

man that's crazy town. I just use .2mm pure nickel. 

I'm about to do something entirely different though and get away from spot welding packs. I'm designing a nickel/paperboard laminate sheet that will be machined to shape and feature holes over the cells for individual fuse wire soldering. Sticky back on the paper will allow the strips to be stuck on then easily soldered. Should reduce build time drastically and add some safety. 

If i can find the nickel rolls wide enough to work with for less than the cost of a lifetime relationship with a woman i'll get this ball rolling.

really? single or double strip? I like copper since it has less resistance however it was a bit time consuming at first, after so many the build time drastically decreases. I like that idea though I feel like finding a manufacturer may be difficult, but surely possible and will definetly be following that if you follow through. thin spacers are a little bit more towards where im leaning now along with a smart bms

I'm doing the rubber bands.  gunna work.  vibrations shouldn't affect it...the whole unit would be isolated.  been wanting a simple compression pack for ages.  ive got copper strip galore.  spent a fortune developing it..and now just want to do rubber bands.

there are a few out there but as you stated very expensive, Its so tempting though, i just dont like bumping up in size everytime i want more discharge

I cut my own copper strips now rather than pay for them, Just one big roll of .2mm copper sheet and cut to whataver dimentions i need. maybe he could cut my sheet for me

rather just use a better, simpler, one-plug balance charger and that wouldn't be too hard to make with the right plug.  bms seem to break more than almost anything.  take up space.  expensive.  limiting.   and surely a cell can last till it gets back home to be balanced...if it cant it was probably screwed to begin with

rubber bands seems easier!  just have to make sure the copper doesn't cut into the wrong polarity..which the stuff easily seems to do.  and a band could hold it all in place better I bet.  and they can hold their springiness for a long enough time I bet.

I use bms because of ease I guess balance chargers arent too hard if you know what youre doing but i cant seem to get away from the one plug charging solution

rubber bands will probably be much easier, i think im like you where I just care about what works, I just cant see a customer wanting to buy a battery assembled with rubber bands:cry:

if it works it works though. and this is just for me.  I hate soldering or even the idea of spot welding with nickel.  people do that because it's easy and done on a large scale but surely for us, being small, copper is doable.   I'll be throwing it together this week.  theres probably a better rubber band out there these days.  I made a lot of versions that would allow the board to be the compression pack and you'd pop in the cells but it's too much work.  just separate wrapped up packs ...I've even seen duct tape and copper..not that I think that's a good idea as that will lose it's spring quickly.
thanks

@Hummie The thing you forget about balance chargers is they aren't cheap. BMS or balance charger, your paying either way for the balancing.

I agree small scale makes it much easier, I was not a fan of spotwelding but the later if nickel keeps the heat when soldering from reaching the cell so I get the best of both worlds

yeah i'll take a BMS over a 12S balance charger any day. But if it was just me and a few boards of different ack sizes.. yeah single plug balance charger that can work with all my boards by selecting the cell count at charge time? yeah, that's not a bad plan really.

balance chargers are expensive but charging cells individually can be cheap.  if you have a plug that charges them all separately it removes complications. a 13 prong plug I think would work.   could even hook up the inductance charging method

https://www.instructables.com/id/1-Cell-LiPo-Li-ion-Battery-Charger-CCCV/

I cant find the one I want but could take 12 of these and hook them to one plug.

and a bulk power supply on the other end, all in a box

I still like the idea of using 12 wireless chargers that charge cell by cell, and avoid the bms like that.

Wireless charging + no need for a bms, lol.

IDK though, too many ideas, but I do now more than ever want to get going in batteries.

P group level 1S BMSs on charging only with a proper  LVC on discharge at the eswitch would be ideal.

 So say in the future i was to buy your motors (amongst other things). Would they mount onto surfrodz rkp trucks? I apologize for being such a hub motor noob. I have these sweet trucks and i want them attached to motors one way or another!!

Unfortunately, these hubs require a 12mm axle, and the new motors will require a special 12mm axle.

The problem is a 8mm axle can hold a hub powerful enough to not break it. We found that out the hard way before :)

you've got hubs breaking axles? I thought hubs just rested on the axles and used the aluminum on the hanger as leverage. Or are you removing a lot of aluminum and only leaving the steel on its own?

The broken axle was on hummies triple wide motor on the 8mm axle. Surely the saw the photo at the time, around a year ago...

This is why we're using a 12mm axle now. Had to go custom truck to get it though.
