Hopefully mine is winging its way to me, though the tracking link doesn't go anywhere.  What courier do you use in the EU?

Same as mine. I've even had a mail from Enertion to ask if I can review the vescs!

According to their customer support, you just need to order the bundles alone and check out. They will see where you ordered it from and take care of it.
