Hello everyone and merry Christmas!
-
I recently got "bored" and decided to make a full build list for "fun".

Then it hit me "damn electric skateboards are really fucking expensive" but at the same time I thought "this sounds like way too much. Where is the mistake?".
But after looking on all the cost I came to the conclusion that there were no mistakes...

So I have recently bought all the parts to build an electric skateboard and I've spent about $2000 on a single drive with 10S6P and a VESC including spot welder, car battery and tools (didn't have any at the beginning).

So after comparing this with my full build list were no tools are included only parts, it seems way too expensive. It even seems way to expensive if we just look at the "Without shipping, taxes and optional" price.

And that I have to pay $214 in taxes is just insane. I live in Denmark were the import tax is 25% of the price of the items and $25 to the danish post office (Post Nord) for handling the package.

The worst part is that there is no way to get around that crazy expensive handling fee. THEY ARE THE ONLY ONES WHO IMPORT PACKAGES INTO THE COUNTRY!!!

**Okay, back on track.**

Does $2300 (with taxes, shipping and wire, connectors etc.) or $1800 (only parts) seem like too much or is it pretty average? I would really appreciate if you shared the amount you have spent, what you have built and where you live.

After looking on a lot of build threads, it seem like the same parts on a board made in Europe is around 25% more expensive than if it was made in the US. The reason for that is TAXES!!! THAT'S INSANE!!!


**THE BUILD:**

And again, merry Christmas everyone!

My first build was about 500 dollars in parts, but i went threw around 1000 with all the stuff i broke (Chinese shit) and tools

Nice build list. Quality parts. Well done on google sheet. 25% more to build esk8 in EU... crazy. I can see it when comparing price of ABEC 107s between US and EU prices. 

The nano gear drive on tayto will be amazing. It seems like you are making your own battery. Imagine if you didn’t build and had to buy one.

My first build in parts was $1600-1700 mainly using TB parts.

I think I could build my board again for USD1000, which was my budget. 10s3p, Unity, dual 6354

But once you factor in mistakes, unexpected one off tools, and annoying little bits and pieces (loctite, connectors, hardware etc)...

I think its fairly accurate. Alot of money for first time builders is spent on the tools and breaking stuff and having to replace it with higher quality parts.

You can go all out and drop even more money if you want to go crazy. I think "bugdet builds" can clock in just under $1000 for high quality stuff and I've seen builds go up to around $2500. 

It all depends on what you want and how you want to build it. 

But that's the beauty of DIY. With production boards, you get whatever they are selling. You want a better set of motors? Nope!

With DIY you can go as far as you want or as cheap as you want (within limits)

That 25% is normal. We pay in Belgium 21% on the price of the amount on the package. Also the post ask around 20-30euro administration fee on each package that is above 21euro.

```
Unity = 250
Dual 6354 drive train = 30(trucks)+40(wheels)+170(motors)+150(pulleys & motor mounts) = 390
Battery = 170
Deck, enclosure = 150
And some more...

That's $960 excl. shipping, extras (bolts etc.) 
That's at least $500 less than the build I put together but how is it possible?
I feel like something went wrong in the prices above but it also seems realistic.
At the same time it seems way too cheap compared to my build list and what parts you got.

I just don't get it.....

Edit:
Actually it seems realistic. Only a $500 difference is actually not that much compared to all the extras you get in the build I made (bushings, bearings etc.)

You all might shoot me - I’ve never spent more than $1500 on a board. In fact, I spent 1500 on my mountainboard and other than that I’ve never spent more than 900 on a board. It’s all a matter of waiting for the right deals to come along

I'm planning on building a electric skate board in the start of 2019. These are the parts i think i'll be using. For me the total price adds up to about 1150 euros, but if you live in the US you'll probably have to spend much less because of the import taxes and shipping costs.
_parts list_
-Loaded Vanguard
-Orangatang Caguama (with bearings)
-Caliber II Trucks (set)

- HGLRC-Flipsky 6354 190KV (2X)
-ownboard remote controllers
-Battery and ESC case with LCD display
-Caliber II Drive System Kit (2X)
-Dual FSESC 4.20 100A
-Ownboard Sanyo 20700 with Charger
-Anti spark switch pro

any thoughts? this will be my first build and would love to hear your oppinions :)

Seems like this is a boosted copy, diy let's you build whats right for you

I'm planning on using it for fun, i live in Holland and the roads here are pretty smooth in the most places. I go out on a normal board pretty often (when its not winter) on a normal board and would love to cruise around on an E-board for longer trips. 
I am quitte a tall guy and weigh about 80 kg (175lbs). 
My board is indeed kind of a boosted copy, I got most of my inspiration from the foosted board of skate metric and other boosted copys i've seen. Lack the inspiration and knowledge to completely come up with my own design. I've already put sooo many late nights into doing research online (kinda got addicted to this stuff:sweat_smile:). 

So yeah, if you have any ideas for me, please let me know.

I would change a lot of things for your build tbh

First of the motors. They don't have a reputation, try and buy some maytech, torqueboard or SK3 motors

Your battery can be built by someone on the forum such as @pjotr47 and @acido

You can still buy focboxes or you can use that ESC it's not bad with the right settings

And scout the forum for deals, you want quality stuff even if it's used.

That deck is not a flex deck

Thx! that helps a lot, i am kinda on the fence about the hummie deck tho... its quitte low so the motors would probably not be able to fit underneath. this would be fine normally, but electric skateboards are still kind of illegal in holland so im trying to keep it low profile if you know what I mean...
anyways, thank you so much man!

I spent around 1300 euro on my trampa carver with etoxx drive, vesc6s and 12S4P

Only thing i bought brand new was the batteries that i welded(in bulk without tax), etoxx drive and eboosted enclosure. Rest was either soldered from scratch by me or bought second hand.

You can really cut some cost if youre willing to do more labour and find some great parts cheap from other ppl. Build took me 6 months tho since it took a while to hunt second hand stuff.

2 focboxes 2 sk3s some hk lipos, caliber trucks and flywheel clones from Amazon.com. A deck from any retailer you like Johnnys pully kits hk motor mount with locative red for screws u can also add heatshrink on the truck (for reduced vibrations to the mount)
And wires and xts from hk too.


The mount would be the only sketch part.

Yeah plus your battery is twice the size of mine. I cheaped out on motors (flipsky) and bms (aliexpress). But I mean it’s moot point anyway cos I ended up ordering an extra e-caliber truck (thought standard calibers would be too narrow), blowing up a bms, buying some wera hex keys, buying a band saw...

There is one mistake. The mistake of you taking on this expensive hobby that seems to be a money pit. Really ask yourself if you wish to enter this realm because the amount you plan to spend can be easily match with buying a new gaming computer or going on a trip.

unforutnately that´s not always possible.
I can´t imagine to get a emtb done under 1500$, shipping only will already be 400$ min. Even with black friday deals etc.... for example, to get some wheels, bindings and bearings from mbs, cost me 95$ shipping on a total of not even 200$ in value of parts. 

I think a big factor is your location and availabilty of parts.
your build priorities and goals
and for sure, if you go singel, dual or quad drive

that´s 150€ for the battery without bms
150€ for shipped eboosted enclosure and 500€ for the gear drive.
(round about) so 800€ in total  of new parts.
so 500€ for two vesc6, 2x motors, bms, remote, deck, trucks, wheels, remote
that´s a very very good deal you got!

Please don't get me wrong. I really love this hobby and the feeling when riding an electric skateboard, so it's all worth it for me when spending that much money. There is nothing that can replace that feeling of going 20mph on a skateboard.

I don't want the cost to stop me. But at the same time it does a bit. I mean, imagine what else you could spent that money on. As you said; you could go on a trip or buy a new gaming computer for that money. Or buy 2000 hamburgers :face_with_raised_eyebrow:

That's a shame if you ask me. It takes MONTHS for me to have enough money for a new build. But there is not much to do about it.

Lol, my previous hobby that I was a part of (still technically am, just on a slight break) is Magic the Gathering. Which has been correctly dubbed "cardboard crack." Over the past 6 or so years I have invested in an amount of money I don't ever want to know. I currently have multiple decks that stand between 1k to maybe 2.5k at certain times. There's no regrets and it was a slowly accumulated process that I didn't straight up pay for every bit. Regardless Ioved every bit of it. At least with this venture, I've gotten some tools and knowledge that is applicable to other things.

I looked into building a lacroix , about £2000 I’m sure it can be done cheaper though , mate of mine built a decent trampa but with parts from here there and everywhere total cost about £800 (not including the parts he bought but didn’t use and then had to sell to recoup those costs)

Guessing the uk?  When pricing a lacroix factor in the shipping and taxes.  For some reason  importing from canada is hellish expensive to Australia and I'm guessing probably the same to england.  Its cheaper to have it shipped to the us first.  Theres one guy over here bought a complete set up and it ended up costing nearly 5000 aus.  Obviously even though we're commonwealth buddies we must have crap trade agreements.

Just the deck and enclosure at 700 us ends up nearly 1500 aus to get it here.  Seriously think about getting a us member to help you out. Sure they were offering free shipping to the us and then get the guy to send it on marked gift.  Might save you a few quid

I recently completed a build for $1200 with 6" pneumatic wheels, 10S4P 10Ah battery and 2X6375 motors. While I am happy that it's on the lower end in terms of build cost, but it's more expensive than what it should be. I digest the cost easily because I consider it a hobby. I do understand economies of scale and also that hobby stuffs are priced differently, but when you compare material and manufacturing cost one can clearly see that we are overpaying. I wonder if it will change anytime soon. 

BTW, what triggered the thought is that a motorcycle, with 3.2KW, 72Volt 30AH Li-ion, from a USA company costs just $2500. If you look for Chinese then you can get things as low as $1500. Someone on reddit mentioned how $800 electric bike(shipped) are really popular in china, so ~1500 for the same bike in USA seems reasonable. Apparently they are common spot in NYC too. Anyway here are a few links if that piqued your interest.
