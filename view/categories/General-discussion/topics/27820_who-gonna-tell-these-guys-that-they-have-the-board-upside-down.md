Lol yeah ... I know there was a thread...and I forget @Psykoboard is on here too...

Maybe they can rationalize why the board is the wrong way up

This Is pretty Extreme  and looks upside down 

Don't see any practical purpose of the shape of the deck except for it to look strange

they're making claims about inbuilt mudflaps to keep rain from splashing you. I guess someones already told them it's upside down and that's the best their PR guy who come up with

It's for us lazy skaters who need a ramp to get up on our boards.

Either that or they really wanted a board that could ollie out of a darkslide.
