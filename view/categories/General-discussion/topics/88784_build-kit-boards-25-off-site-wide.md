Depending on your trucks that would decide 6354 or 6374, IIRC you already used mismatched mounts so you can use 6374‚Äôs

Please dont use any discount codes as I barely make anything on the enclosures (you may have to place a separate order, email me for details). I wont be restocking these after this order, so if your interested please get your order placed in the next few days.

@briman05 @yelnats8j I looked into it and I could only set it to expire in X number of days, not expire at X time. So depending on when it sent it may be messed up. 

Will try to fix this next time

No worries. It was just a little confusing to me because it said 72 hour but it was like a 36 hour sale. But no worries. Thanks for the sale
