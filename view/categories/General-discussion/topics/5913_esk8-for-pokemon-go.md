If you haven't heard yet, a new game was released called Pokemon go. [Pokemon Go is a free-to-play mobile app that you can download for iOS or Android. The game works by using your phone‚Äôs GPS for your real-world location and augmented reality to bring up those cool-looking Pokemon on your screen, overlaid on top of what you see in front of you. And you‚Äîthe digital you‚Äîcan be customized with clothing, a faction (or ‚Äúteam‚Äù of players you can join) and other options, and you level up as you play.](http://lifehacker.com/what-is-pokemon-go-and-why-is-everyone-talking-about-it-1783420761) 

Anyways, this game is giving me a reason to go out an about on my board:

I suggest you give it a try! It is a lot of fun, even if you have never played a Pokemon (like me)/ I have met a lot of other people playing it and they always ask about my board.

Be aware this has only just came out & is already being used to rob people. Bad enough losing your phone / wallet, but your eSk8 too!? :( Others have wandered into hazardous areas and another was led to a body! Stay safe.

I think the robberies were both during the day and in public spaces, parking lots etc. I think you might actually have an advantage on them. A quick getaway!

I had the same thought. Taking the Eboard out with Pokemon go. Anyone know the speed to hatch an egg? I don't want it to think I'm in a car.

I also have heard about folks being mugged.

Regardless of what you are doing - being aware of your surroundings and not going into shady spots by yourself (or at all) is best.  

I've been chatting w/ a buddy at work who has been walking his ass off (like 10mi this weekend) for Pokemon Go.  That's cool - a IT geek getting some exercise for the game.  Love the idea.  I told him he needs to try e-sk8 for it next...

OHH MY GOD ME TO!!! I wanted to play it so badly :( though I play Ingress which is very similar, and made by the same devs, it's a lot of fun and works with Intel Atoms lol. I have an Asus Zen Fone 2, what kinda phone do you have?

This game honestly makes gives me a bittersweet kind of feeling... as the internet quotes:
"It took Michele Obama 4 years to make progress with Americans' fitness, it took Pokemon Go 24 hours"
It's great that people are getting outside, but a game shouldn't be the motivation... I went to the park yesterday and about 20 people were walking around like zombies trying to "find pokemon" with this game.

I think I can hotspot and use my s3. I'm going to try it when I get home. I got a zenfone2 back in March '15, the day after it was released in Taiwan.

A hobby is a hobby. It beats being an mmorpg zombie and sitting in front of my computer 12+ hours a day.

I went on the Play Store and it still says its incompatible with Inte Atom chips :(  and yes it was for version 0.29.2 is it working for you somehow on your Zen fone, or did you just hear that its compatible?

No, I played all day. Find the apk online, most are safe. I think part of it is that the fix was released in Germany.

I've been üòã playing for a week now. This is the üëç best thing while e-bording. I also üö¥ ride üöÜ transit. This is üò± üí¶ sweet. I can cover much realestate. I also play ingress. So this isn't a üÜï platform for me. I just üçÉ wonder what are the new updates are going üòã to be like. I will say this. Pay attention while you play. It can be distracting and addictive. Lol
