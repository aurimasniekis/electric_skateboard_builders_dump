Hey Guys. So I'm super close to finishing the BMB prototype and looking to off the Evolve. Anyone looking for BMs ESC  that 11 pin connector!! I have 1 lol. Deck wheels enclosure all of it. I'll off it cheap too. Here's a funny pic of how rinky dink the GTX looks next to a BMB ![20190917_213000_HDR|281x500](upload://k3oVSXMYI0F16KGDOdElwPfDqLx.jpeg)

If you're in the state's I might take the BMS, does it need to be used with the Evolve ESC or can it be standalone?

I would assume it can be used with others. I'll check with My microprocessor developer to be 100% . I'm in Boulder CO ü§ó

Good stuff. Yeah there's the answer. Haha. I have it if anyone wants it. I can email LHB. Doesn't matter to me. Sell it or trash it. I will hold onto the 11 pin connector thought. That's a pain in the butt to find. I bought a 160A 12s BMS for $54 on eBay. Kinda big but a monster!üòÅ.![20190912_154552_HDR|281x500](upload://wkihej3AY5Xbz2z19dpdOVDimcI.jpeg)

Not too interested in the BMS + ESC if you want to sell those separately, but what would you want for the whole/rest of the kit, picked up?

Evolve Deck $100, enclosure $25 stand alone. You can go to my website bouldermountainboards.com to pay and get shipping. It's new so I have to set up like a tab for side orders or something. PayPal and square is all good to go and you get tracking and all. Contact info on site. üëç
