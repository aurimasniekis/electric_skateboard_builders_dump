And I KNOW I'm not the only one who spent a ridiculous amount of time, money, and effort trying to build an airplane legal board. ****heartbreak****

Anyone know of possible loopholes?

There's more to it as well - UK is putting more restrictions and it may be harder to get batteries in the first place

The title to that article is a little misleading. It seems if all those safety regulations were stalled, that it would be easier to obtain batteries not harder. All these regulations are just going to drive the price up

If you remove the batteries, it's no longer a battery-assisted vehicle.  Maybe slide off the motor mount too for good measure

I think bringing an e-board on a plane is a gamble either way, but this might let you _skate_ by the restrictions (see what I did there... :joy:)

Honestly seeing all of those articles was just a huge slam to my plans for travel this summer - I guess I'll be sticking to the old penny board
