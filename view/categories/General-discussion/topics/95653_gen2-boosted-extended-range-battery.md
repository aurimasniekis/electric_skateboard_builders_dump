Yo dude, I’ve been considering buying the extended range battery for my bboard but can’t help be annoyed on the range only being 14 miles ( realistically 12 ) and the price being around £300 in the uk. I was thinking surly they’d be releasing a gen 2 extended range soon with improved Capacity? Any thoughts? 

Cheers guys

Go buy a battery on the forum

There is a really good seller called @Tinp123 he will sell you a battety with twice the range for less then the price

He can also make an enclosure and then you just swap the enclosures and done

Thanks for tag, but I can not help in this case. Boosted uses different chemistry (LiFePO4 vs Li-Ion) and proprietary bms. It is not so easy to upgrade boosted with diy battery.
