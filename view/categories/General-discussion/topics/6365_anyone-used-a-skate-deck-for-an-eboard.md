You could use it. But it limits your component place and size of the motor. Depending on what you had in mind right...

Hub motors small battery so size doesn't matter. I'm just worried about wheel bite as I don't want to use spacers.

What size of wheels? I've got 66's on an oldschool santa cruze deck and need at least an inch riser.

Oh it happened. Here's the Bustin YOFACE I used, 20ish" wheelbase, 39" total deck length. This box formerly held a 10ah 6S pack and a pair of Favourite ESCs.

Use venom double barrels or something similar to eliminate wobble.

[This guy on instructables did](http://www.instructables.com/id/Electric-Skateboard-v20) by pushing his trucks all the way to the edges for an interesting drop look. I may try this with one of my old school decks.

With some bones 59s and a set of indies this deck will do flip tricks all damn day. Provided you're  6'4" and need a larger trick deck.

I can testify to having the trucks on the kicks being awesome. Use angled risers to make the truck angle less harsh. Though it may be difficult to do this if you're thinking of putting that pre-built mellow board clone you bought on the kicks
I used orangatang balut wheels which must be 72 mm or around there. I can't find pictures as this was 2011 or 2012 :(

Yeah that's why I said I can't use riser pads haha. I think the skate deck idea will have to go... only if hyper sold the bustin spliff deck by itself, would look good next to my other bustin deck that I will use for my diy.

70mm wheels. I wanted to go smaller but really couldn't get a cog much smaller.
no wheel bite. turned so tight.. I loved it

only reason I never followed through with it permanently was because at the speeds I do it was bloody dangerous.
longer board more stable at high speed.

It's not a bad idea...just a totally different ride...

My POS Penny is not for the novice... But you can carve at low speed... Bump up the speed and it turns into a SYF machine...be ready with  band aids ... Speed wobble o Rama

Yeah, NZ is a bloody long way from just about everywhere. I'd personally grab a used board from trademe.co.nz and spent a few hours cleaning it up. Provided the board is structurally sound, most wood boards clean up nicely.

Nobody does it cause we are so concerned abt getting speed....

Did a rip session a few weeks ago for a few miles...great work out

it's late and not done, but just finished sanding a 33x10 old school style deck i'm settig up for a buddy of mine.  Moved the WB back a bit and putting the front truck on nose/angle.

Here it is yesterday as i was prepping to lay down the top CF:

and lots of sanding:

CF laid by hand isn't perfect, so sanding and will add a quick clearcoat for UV and give it some wet/shine to look nicer.

GL!

Thank you everyone for the advice, after consideration I decided to get this... http://www.extremeskates.com.au/longboards/longboard-deck/jet-mr-potato
Not a skateboard but very similar to @RunPlayBacks spud deck which looks awesome. A skate deck would have been a bit wild for me I think. I have been commuting with a longboard for a while but this will be my first eboard so wanted something a bit more stable. Can't wait to go for a ride. Just need to wait now :-/ maybe a skate deck will be in the future :-)

Might only work with hubs with rotated mounts because I don't think it works on enertion mounts...
It only works when you flip a truck backwards in that way you can't ride it. Flip it the normal way and you mounts are way to close to the ground <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/6/623b7b9150d57e25b8fc03c50455424044a25f4d.jpeg" width="666" height="500">. <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/c/c8d751fed6eb84a65ca76de0ab5e6f7dd52f29ce.jpeg" width="375" height="500">
