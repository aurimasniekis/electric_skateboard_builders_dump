Still shows 3 bars left on remote, but cuts power after a few seconds of riding and refuses to work, after just turning on.  Anyone  have this issue?  1st time this has happened. Thanks

Sounds like your battery is out of balance.
One P group is on low Voltage and causes your BMS to shut down.
Did you ride your board in rain or on damp roads?
When you charge your board is the remote showing full charge?

I have ridden in damp roads. On full charge, it's fine. Only when it got to 3 bars it had that problem once. I fully charged it & left it on the charger a few extra hours. I'll test it out again soon.
