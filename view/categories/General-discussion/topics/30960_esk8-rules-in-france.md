What are the legal requirements in France? Next week, I would like to travel to france (Nancy) and my E-MTB are going with me :). I have to adjust myself to a longer imprisonment and take enough clean underwear? ;))

There isn't really any rules in France, i'm riding in Paris and cops are really nice with us, no problem, just don't be prudent and don't go at 40mph when you see policemens! No problem with eskating in france so far!
