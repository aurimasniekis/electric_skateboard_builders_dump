Think the title sums it up. I need to make my build a little more compact for transport reasons (fitting into the boot of my car aha). 

I was recommended a Tayto, but unfortunately even with the 13" wide trucks I'm using, these wheels just won't work (without a big fat 45degree riser anyway lol, which is... an option). 

At the moment I have the Landyachts Falcon 36" and the Landyachts Battleaxe 35" bookmarked, as they should work and they -should- fit. But before I pull the trigger I just wondered if there were any other options that might work? 

Limited to UK/EU based stores, importing from the US or Australia isn't really an option for this. There's a lot of good boards around still, but some get very expensive and I'm limiting my budget to under Â£150 if I can manage it. Wiggle room for a great board but prefer it cheaper if I can. 

Thanks for your thoughts :)
