Hey, @BigBoyToys. I think this dude may have one of the nastiest setups in SoCal. AWD Hubs making big Watts.   Derek how is the health on your machine. I think your build would shine in a 200' drag race againsed my dual motor.  I know a guy who is also down for the 200' who has a quick single motor if you could find someone to race him.  üèÅThis is what a call out looks like fellas.

Had the race board up at Pat's Acres near Portland Oregon. Cam, (I think it's short for camshaft or Cameron maby) the owners son spent some time on the track gaging the feasibility of an esk8 racing event at their racing facility. A great family with a racing tradition. https://youtu.be/SBwAO7dxdGc

Are u reaching top speed in 200'? I would think id need a 330. Is your set up sensored or would it be a kick start race?

If ya think 330' would make a better race, sounds good. If kicking gets ya off the line quicker then kick it. Don't jump the start or cross the center.  Do these things and cross the finish line first wins the race.

well first thing that comes to mind is the different classes. There could be a single motor class, duel motor class. AWD class. The could also be a restriction on battery cells for each class, and wheel size restrictions. 

The could be what is know as a unlimited class with less restrictions outside of maybe board size and what not. This is so people don't start building and racing thing that just don't look like skateboards anymore. I think his happened in downhill skateboarding in the late 70's or earl 80's.A Fat dudes on what amounted to street luge started winning some of the more open events. 

Then we have race styles, rally, track, "stock car", downhill...
 just some ideas.

200 feet? Let me know when you are ready for a 30 mile race ;)

Distance racing could end up being a team event. Keep your team leader in the draft till the last 5 since he will be riding on taller gearing.... give it time, it will happen.

Personally, I want a paved track (with angled corners like a real race track). It will happen when I get the space and funds to do so, likely a little more inward from the shore though. Need land, lol. I think a minute to 2 minute lap would suffice to start.

Yea, I think if we grease their palms with enough money, they'll be fine with it. Maybe we could get a big event at some venue like that and find an eskate company(s) willing to put up to help make it happen.

Personally, If I'm racing like that though, I need full leathers. It's too likely you'll go down at some point. Soon though, I'll invest in it.

If this is in SoCal, I definitely want to be a part of it. And I do have an R2 on pre-order, so don't mind showing how that runs against some of the others. I've been watching the hub/urethane argument with my popcorn. Funny stuff. I also want to film this so we can get some video evidence of fastest boards. Let's do a straight up 100m (that's pretty close to the 330 ft that was discussed earlier. Love the 30 mile race idea, too. Or maybe make it 26.2 and call it a marathon. Also would like to see an enduro for 24 hours of straight racing (charges and battery swaps allowed). Let's see whose motors are still turning at the end of that one. 

When it comes to racing, this is the sort of stuff that lifts all boards to higher levels.

In Au Kart tracks are the cheapest to hire and often have a few configurations you can run. Insurance will be the tough thing. You guys might be able to get around that cheap and get the venues to take more notice if you form a formal eSk8 racing club with Pres, secretary... The club can rep the members and organize the events/ insurance ect... Can also be a good vehicle to lobby for law change too.
Other wise you might need to cowboy it on abandoned parking lots or the like? Maybe a abandoned air field could work too?

You are right about the insurance. I emailed a couple of go kart tracks to see if they would be open to it. The one that actually replied back had this to say:

"This is California, lawsuit capital of the world and unfortunately, our insurance company would have a kitten if we did that‚Ä¶sorry!"

When I followed up about having participants sign a waiver, I got this:
"Legally, you can‚Äôt sign a waiver for 'gross negligence' and that‚Äôs how it would be defined if we allowed you to use your own karts."

The OC great park is where El Toro Marine base used to be- so big runways there. I have seen some autocross events out there, but the surface can be sketchy depending on the area. We will definitely need to tackle the insurance thing at some point.

I think 24 hours endurance might be asking a lot, this isn't exactly LeMan. But I think 8-12 hours should be enough tell us how much beating a board can take.

I am not sure how it works in Cali, but 6-10 people should be plenty to get started, you form club (I think in my state 2 is enough), appoint a Pres, Sec... you need to keep minutes of meetings, hold a AGM. It is like a business but you're not interested in making money just eSk8.
You will need to come up with some competition rules that cover basic safety, skater protection, first aid and possibly some scrutineer/ process to classify boards as not mechanically/ electrically dangerous. You know just basic stuff like no metal spikes or spinning blades attached to wheels and having all electrical connections insulated...
Essentially you will need to show a pencil pusher that you have reasonably mitigated the risks involved and have kept records to show your due process.

Not in Au mate, granted when I used to race track cycling the club was also a member of a national and international org... but I don't think they exist yet? do they?
Problem or asset is eSk8 is'nt downhill or motorcycle or... and if you link with another body they might imply oversight on your rules and club direction. I honestly believe eSk8 racing could become significant, it could become the most accessible form of motorsport to "joe" public.

I tested the Raptor2 over the weekend as well. Rides great, no major complaints. Still gets hot though under heavy riding. Also, its faster than pretty much all production boards but it's really no race for a high powered custom build machine. My 4wd would demolish it even with me on it.

Thanks for the perspective! Do you have any build threads for your 4wd's? So far, 4wd hummies motors with sensors had more torque then most could ever handle, and the carvon v2's were fun for speed (obviously not torque machines though).

I was curious about it getting hot. There "passive cooling" is interesting, but hummies hubs have done essentially the same thing from the beginning.

Cooling is really the biggest issue with hubs. I think 4wd for hubs for really aggressive or heavier riders will always be needed.

Theres no magic to the r-spec ghost. They will have more iron losses due to using a 24 tooth stator (at the gain of some low speed torque), which should result in more heat. So I would expect them to run hotter than a 12 tooth stator.

2200w per wheel 11.8 hp That's a move in the right direction.  Here's an argument. Some say more electronics more to go wrong. My thought is your electrical delivery is only having to work at 42% capacity. That's a safety factor I like to see in a system. No heat no smoke and no thoughts about power loss. Only down side is the weight. That's gonna be the story when we start turning. Gonna be a cool ride Nate. It's gonna take balls to ride itü§ò

Lol @longhairedboy actually put it on a pretty tame setting. He's in the process of tuning it into a "Wild Fukin Animal (TM)". 

I totally agree on the safety factor though, this board was actually able to run on front wheel drive the whole time the rear motors stopped working. I don't think i can ever go back to dual 6355. AWD is totally on a diff league of its own.

Dude, i'm gonna take you up on that offer to run, you're gonna regret it, :joy:

On motorcross bikes converted to supermotard, if you don't use a cush-hub (rubber mounts in the hub-rear sprocket union you eat drive train components. It _might_ be a more effecient way to look after the drive train?

Dude, please don't go over 25 mph on a flexy deck like that.  Seeing more people wiping out on those than any other deck in electric from gearing them to go too fast. They buck like a wild horse when they get speed wobbles and i don't think any amount of stabilization will calm the torsional flex in those decks.

We need to be sure we  all ride safe, full face(mandatory), leathers or body armor etc. We also need to give our fellow riders a heads up if we see something that might get them into a bad situation.

What @chaka said. This is why i use 9-plies of hard rock maple and came up with a distinct w-concave that dramatically reduces flex, adding stability and plenty of footing options for high speed. A flexy deck will get you killed while hauling ass. They make awesome casual cruisers at lower speeds but racing them is suicide unless your doing some kind of specialized maneuvering race at lower speeds that demands the exact performance characteristics that make them terrible for high speeds.

U don't have to tell me about this trampa setup. I got catapulted into the street head first at 30mph first time without  helmet. Got 15 stiches in my head broken elbow road rash on my face and everywhere else. Second time with a helmet and only got a concussion lol. These flexy decks with added boucy pnuematics real unstable at high speeds. 

I feel so comfortable going 40mph on my stiff bustin deck with 97mm abec 11. Wish I could go 50!

My trampa does do almost 50 but I'll never take it past 35mph. Trying to add that stabilizer and we'll c if it helps.

And most importantly for speed and stability, figure out a way to take the rear steer angle outta your trampa truck. Basically remove all the the characteristics That make that thing fun to ride under 20 mph. I'd just use it for what it is and build a road rocket.

I hear this everyday! Finishing complete orders now and will have more time for new projects. I grew up around SCORE offroad racing so I am definitely drawn to the idea of flying over dirt roads at high speed! 

@MoeStooge We could design the angle into the deck or use some wedges. I favor a custom deck since wedging can weaken the mounting fasteners if it is too extreme of an angle.

I don't know. I disagree with you and @Mikeomania12 assessment. Me and mike have the same set up so I'm hitting 35-40 almost on the daily.
I can't speak for the other flexy deck as I've had no long term hands on experienc with them, but Trampa's strap, large wheels, flex and wider trucks are a really great combination against  cracks and potholes here in the city. 

On the other hand, although @longhairedboy board is great, his stiff deck had always taken a toll on my legs, especially knees. 

Stability wise, I've had no issues with wobbling both on the flex or on the trucks. I think fundamentally, the straps are great for pushing and stabilizing the trucks. I don't use it just for carving, I push both my foot toward both trucks when using the straps without tightening them so it really helps. I think Mike tighten the straps considerably for carving so he's able to weave through traffic. He's usually ahead of me when we're riding in the city together. That and also because he's more ballsy. But tightening the straps also limits feet movement and increase fatigueness in both foot while also limiting foot placement toward the center of the deck where the flex is the most severe. 

Experience has taught me to loosen both straps but tight enough to do hard carving while giving me the ability to change foot position at a moments notice. I think every board has its good and bad, and with time I've really grown to like the Trampa mtb along my LHB board.

Ill be the 1st to tell you my 4wd hub board will definately have a meltdown at pikes peak. Id be happy to come watch you all melt your builds too though. I know my board can handle short bursts of power  (like a 10 second drag race) but Id have to tone the settings way way back if it was going to be expected climb for an extended period of time. My hub motors are only rated for 500w continous each. I might as well be racing a boosted board at that point lol.

Pike's will definitely be an endurance race. If you set up for speed, you aren't going to make it. I'd be surprised if more than 1 board makes it to the top. It's a mean climb. You need a setup that will at least keep you moving on the steepest pitches. Any more than that and you are going to be sitting on the side of the road looking for a lift.

@MoeStooge I've been thinking about your suggestion to connect with downhill race promoters about insurance for races. I wonder if there is a possibility to tag an esk8 race onto a downhill event (maybe the Catalina Classic)? Do a race of 2 laps up and down the course. The course is already there. There is a built in crowd already. I bet we would convert some of the downhill guys once they see these boards ripping the course uphill. Plus if the insurance is paid for already the cost would be minimal.

That would be a win for the promoter and spectators. It would also help put esk8 racing in more of a legitimate light. I can make an esk8 go fast but I'm not very pretty doing it. This may be a good way to get the racing ball rolling without making it a shit show.

Railing corners and controlling your slide from the Apex out with the throttle is something very few people have experienced on an esk8 board. It's way funner than going fast and straight and for me is a game changer for my mindset of how a wheel and it's contact patch needs to be completely re engineered and changed. More to come on this.

Honestly it's a rc car tire stretched over a urethane wheel.  It's what I would call a rendering to get people's gears turning in their brains. If no one steps up and tries we don't move towards a grippier wheel for road course racing our esk8's.

Personally @MoeStooge there is so much speed to be found in the pneumatic tires it is not funny. The reduction in rolling resistance using high pressure tubular construction tires and latex tubes such as used on a racing bicycle is huge, across all four wheels you find hundreds of watts of power compared to to butyl rubber clinchers with out sacrificing grip.

Or then you have the tubeless construction of HP motorcycle tires now favoured?

True! Since I widened the SixShooter hubs we finally got the contact patch where we wanted them to be. Now, with less psi than we used to run, we have much less rolling resistance. Learning from my real job on a 200k lb. Excavator running over liquified ground, it was sinking so bad we had to order wider tracks. The thing basically floated over the surface after the install

True to that nature you roll lighter on wider tires. There are many variables though. We really lucked out with the new hub and tire combo.

Id love to see @MoeStooge set up his spur gears on a set of your six shooters. Id consider them as well for my 4wd trampa build if they were compatiable with nowinds direct drive kit but only hyperstar hubs will work. I dont think I can go with the lower profile tires either as Ill need the ground clearance for batteries. As u guys could probably tell, the taller tire I was using folds over under heavy side loads. I tried more tire pressure in them as well but it made them less predictable at the brink of traction.

Im sure it could be done, it just wouldnt bolt up without some sort of adaptor which Im not particularly inclined to make. If you had the adaptors made I might buy them off you though, it could be in your interest as many people are starting to use nowinds kit. The smaller circumferemce wheel would also require a higher KV rating to reach my target speed and Im already struggling to find that in the motor size Im considering.

I cant tell really what that wheels is.  It looks like a nitrile or butyl tire which would've had air in it but instead just a big solid core here.  It's pretty much a hub motor tire.   I have similar I sell but without a tread.  (the tread looks nice).  Maybe you could do a thin air layer in the wheel to give it more rebound for more miles and would likely give better grip as well.  but regardless when they go fast, especially if they get hot and soft, if they're too soft they will expand and fly off.  You could pour them with a thin harder core so you don't have that risk or make them harder.  or just glue them on permanently.  that's all I can think to write.  looks good.

Set an individual record on your own then. No insurance needed, just document it with video so you can prove definitively that you did it. If you think the distance category is important, set the trend. Like I said, I'm happy to maintain the performance records for all to see as long as you can prove it really happened and we can set some parameters on what makes it a fair test that others can replicate and try to beat. 

I'm sure we can create a "cruise around and have fun with your friends" thread if that is what you are about. This one is about testing performance against other boards and riders out there.

Is there a challenge for that.  anyone have a nice luge for high speeds?  every time I laydown on my board it feels awful but if you really want to go fast it seems the fastest position by far on paper.  I wont go over 20 laying on my skateboard.  @MoeStooge how about making something really fast. with your dampers and maybe a pivot point for sharp turns but something you could go 100 laying down in comfort on.  you could fall asleep youre so comfortable.
I like the figure 8 for boards and their agility but all out long distance high speed and battery savings in safety it's got to be a laydown<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/b/a/ba4d6b6f4de5f877133efc15910b0e0e7d3d9f01.jpg" width="672" height="378">

@BigBoyToys knew about a parking lot that was empty on the weekends and usually has guys driving karts around on it. We got there before the kart guys and staked out our spot early. So no cost thanks to Derek and his brother scouting out a spot. The only downside is that we didn't have quite enough room. @MoeStooge was geared for a higher top speed, but we didn't have enough room for him to get up to speed and still have room to shut it down safely. 

Do a little hunting around and you may be able to find a spot on the cheap.

Concept is cool. Speed + rear steer = speed wobble. I already know there are aws cars and trucks however the rear steer is locked out or greatly greatly reduced at speed. It's intent was not to make cornering better but increase turn radius for parking lot turning. We use mechanical rear steer in dirt oval auto racing. The car leans opposite of a skateboard to get the same applied steer effect to the rear.  They do this to load the left rear to create balance across the rear axel and help counter centrifical  force of unloading the lr tire on turn exit. More forward bite = more power able to be put down to the track. <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/4/1/41aab52de199a421a250a4c26a49b347e51f4b28.jpg" width="320" height="240">. Going fast and straight on a skateboard is about eliminating rear steer, reducing front steer, eliminating any truck play and increasing the wheelbase.  While the lean board is a novel concept I am skeptical that is has any stability characteristics. Looks like a hub option only.

I imagine we could all crush usain bolt in any race with a decent board.  

I'd want a course with so many sharp turns you never have the chance to go over 30mph.  one long straight uphill will just be a competition of motors, which is nice in its own way, but as a sport the course should be athletic.  I like mt tam.  similar to pikes peak in length maybe but much sharper turns and nice trees.  could go over the top for downhill the back side.   . <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/4/c/4c5df5ac67d27657b8fd8de0fad2815459110418.jpg" width="690" height="460">

I'd want a course with so many sharp turns you never have the chance to go over 30mph.  one long straight uphill will just be a competition of motors, which is nice in its own way, but as a sport the course should be athletic.

GMR and the mid section inside azusa is all of those things Hummie. And I fully agree with you.

Belts, hubs ,gears. GMR Rally will be well represented. Some exciting shit happening here. Colorado can wait. Pushing our boards to extremes and setting the bar for the world is a very "Old School" approach. This is the way it was done back when men came back from the war, built it and raced it. Racing produced the need for stronger, lighter and better components and they got built. The need and innovation trickled parts from the Racers to the manufacturers to the public.

Such a cool thread. Props to all you guys for pushing the envelope and raising the bar! My personal speed limit is around 30mph at this point, so I don't have much to add except that I'm watching and learning intently. And it's been a week since the last post, so back up to the top!

So the concept of racing e-boards has been thought about for a while. If you dig around there was even an organized spec board racing organization.  Right now e-board racing is an "OUTLAW" sport. With no organized  sanctioning bodies it will remain as one. Our SPD group has laid a cornerstone for others to emulate. As these outlaw events happen are organized in other regions, board counts will grow and governing bodies  will form. Till then get organized.  If production boards is what is prominent for your region, organize and set the bars for box ready boards. Imagine 10 box stock boards running on a track course at the same time. Hell yeah I'd be in on that. To answer your question, thinking is a wasted move if it is not followed by action.

That's just like Nascar!

Though I really wish to see DIY or custom boards racing with weight limits as main rules. 

Example : you can't go above 8kg total, pick your poison and race the hell out of it! Any wheel drive setup allowed.

Given different courses layouts would be provided it would be awesome.

What about length limited categories?  Max xx millimeters in length and width ? That's a way to go.

In my homeland we race custom sail boats (look for Yole) , with time it went down to sponsors allowing better budget for some teams, but the core was talent and teams working together to get the best of everyone.

Fully agreed, but my concern is to see some stuff really out of league come to race (I mean non skating-type EV). 

Let's make this more simple then : no category. Race what you bring. 1WD, 2WD, AWD, more WD, whatever. One rule to get in : take a chalk or a spray bomb, draw an average board size rectangle on the ground. If it fits inside, you're in.

I need to try this out here and report, gonna finish assembly first !

I think @MoeStooge has the right idea bro, he has a life time of racing behind him and I'd hazard at a guess many more in his family. Enjoy this early innovative period, having more rules will just alienate potential riders and when the board counts get up high enough you can start splitting things up. The important thing is when that's done it is done in a way that engages the eSk8 racing community.

How will this get done in the future, who knows. You just suggested a size, I think weight classes would be more productive. But any choice now would be premature, just get out there with what you have and _run what you brung_. Last time these boys got together half the fast times were done by people using boards that belonged to others.

So, I think I have something to contribute now. I've been doing rallycross racing with my Subaru WRX off and on for the past 10 years. On 9/16-9/17, there is a rallycross race and rally school coming to Santa Rosa, CA, about 15 min. from my house, and I've got the ok from the race organizer to bring my mountain board out and run a few laps on the course. I'll try to get as much video footage as I can, but it will be interesting to see how me and my board handle a tight (for cars) dirt course. As much as I like the drag racing, and road course racing, I'd LOVE it if there were eventually some dirt events for the mountain board guys and gals. Kind of like the mountain board racing events they have in Germany (thanks @Duffman). Ideally we'd have both on and off road races at one event, and maybe even mixed supermoto style on/off road races running @psychotiller hubs or MBS AT wheels.

If anyone is interested in seeing what these rallycross events look like, check out the photos and videos on the Norcal Rallycross site.

And here is a fun little video of the actual site in Santa Rosa.

Awesome dude :muscle: is going to be pretty funny if you are not the slowest guy on course. Will all depend how your wheels/tires get along with traction/rolling resistance. Have you got [mud pluggers](http://www.trampaboards.com/innova-mudplugger--8-inch-soft-packed-dirt-tyre-p-12120.html)? It looks a bit lumpy but your'e going to be able to straight line a lot that a car can't.

Searched out and found a prominent rubber moulder who specializes in making tires. We discussed different ideas and concluded a 90mm pneumatic would be expensive. So we went with the hybrid using a molded sleeve and bonding agent.<img   src ="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/d/1/d1ea80ca98c3d5fad1f2c6bff5ac4744ee977a47.jpg" width="281" height="499"> will be testing and putting these through the ringer.  With this setup multiple durometer compounds and tread configurations can be made.  Hope for  the end result is a low cost high grip cap for urethane wheels. Last night's test looked promising. Will keep posting as I punish these hybrid wheels.üèÅ

Started testing with a harder rubber at 59 on the durometer. I want to flog these things, put heat cycles, miles and speed through them. Then after the process is proven we'll start playing with softer wheels. Fig8 testing last night proved to have high levels of grip and rubber left on the pavement. So far so good.<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/f/a/fa86e2984bb1bf8754e64d41cd880d6716711e34.jpg" width="674" height="500">in

Gotta say at this point with the miles put on these in the heat, the bonding part of it has been a non issue. Rolling resistance is as expected, elevated. Grip levels are superior to thane and with a softer compound I think will rival the current pneumatics dominating the onroad short course events. Back to trying to get these to fail. Will do a mileage/mAh comparison to see roll resistance comparison between rubber and thane. I'm gonna guess and say 18% fall off. We will see what the test # say.

Hey! @NummThumz &  SPD participants. The socal performance day thread has, i guess, been locked or concluded. We should collaborate and set the next date soon. Maby have a meeting.

I agree. I think the whole section for esk8 events was closed because the events are not relevant to board building according to onloop. I think the intent is to move more people to the club site.

@MoeStooge
can you describe your vehicle some more because I know youre using a bigger gear ratio with cogs and an inrunner.  I'm interested in how efficiency could go up using a much bigger gear ratio and an inrunner which would have better cooling...possibly even liquid cooled.    

this double helical gear has the potential to get a much bigger gear ratio than a pulley and belt, which would be better for mountain climbing efficiency, and the gear itself seems to be even more efficient than the belt and pulley and can be made almost silent.  I'm liking the idea of making a mount for it that would run maybe a 1000kv inrunner and going for ultimate efficiency.

Helical gear setup would be cool. Not much out there in the cheap and readily available. Potentially a better setup but very unforgiving in the alignment Dept. For me the square cut are strong, forgiving and gear ratio availability is also abundant and cheap. I see some single helical gears being used in helicopter drive systems.  I put down 4200w per wheel through two 200a car esc. It's power is raw and unforgiving. I have yet to have a mechanical drive system failure in its current setup. I did get a napkin stuck in the gear once.  The  spur gears don't wear. The pinions are $8.00 and are a maintenance item. I start looking at them around 50 miles of hard riding.   http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/spur-gear-approach/24506/12?u=moestooge

The esk8 club site is not dead. It was only just born.

It's not geared towards Raptor or Enertion. It's about Riding Electric Skateboards, racing and events and enjoying the act of riding (minus the techno babble)

For example, if you ever want your esk8 expo to be successful you need to step out of the DIY world and attract a broader audience. You won't do that here. 

Diy is a tiny part of the esk8 market. Doing all your discussion in here, when it's not specifically about building, is actually scaring people away and limiting your reach. Don't you want more punters at your race event?

You said it yourself, you are sick of noobs continuosly asking how to solder their vesc, battery and motors. It's very messy and technical, That's not a great impression for people who just like to ride. This place looks foreign for non-diy people.

Don't be so closed minded. With you or without you the esk8 club will be much larger community than esk8.builders. 

Have faith.

With all do respect a 60mph production board. Taking orders this Oct.  8000w total AWD hub motors. $3000.usd  specs soon to be released?  <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/d/4/d4227f6bd88da3b1963203298bb08be2cf208d6f.jpg" width="414" height="499"> https://m.facebook.com/NXTBRD/?_ft_=qid.6463626959229754918%3Amf_story_key.-4218143002049536815%3Atop_level_post_id.635530616571214.  Because this is a builders forum and we are to discuss building, builds or things that are diy related and understanding this is a production board and has no place in discussion on this DIY forum. Maby some of these Super parts will become available to DIY builders. And of course always In the spirit of keeping this post Builder and DIY related and in good standing with our blessed forum governing authorities.  I did say "with all do respect."

Found this comment by nextboards a little deeper in the comment section. My guess is that they will sell the boad with instruction on how to chose a lipo battery, and the user will buy it  depending on their speed, range ect. So i assume for the board to reach top speed you need 12s. "**Just depends on what kind of battery you stick in it, thats the beauty of our board. A 8S Li-Po should be good for around 70 km/h.**" @Cobber @lowGuido

Errm...NO. More heat generated by  components: battery, motors, esc, truck which could lead to the bushings being softened under the heat, which is bad news for anyone going fast and needs that stability. More heat=more stress-less durability especially the wheels which in case of coaster wheels isnt an issue.

Heat is the hub killer, however delivery electronics can be made to carry any amp load at any voltage safely. Mine only carry 65% capacity and never overheat. Yup I agree, without knowing what the delivery system is capable of it's hard to say.  Hub is definitely a weak link at 2000w if 60mph is their expectation. Pushing electronics to their limits is no bueno amigo.

Unfortunately resistive losses increase with the square of current,  going low voltage to reach 8kw is not going to work well for the wiring and vescs lol, but maybe they mean 8kw when you put 12s or 14s in the board?

Fred I think we're talking Apple to apples when I say a low volt high amp system will work as well as a high volt low amp system if the delivery system is sufficient and provides low resistance and the drive system is built to play the part. The downsides of both is higher the voltage the more unstable it becomes. Lower the voltage the equipment to carry the same product gets bigger. I think finding a balance between the two in delivery design is important. We mostly use off the shelf parts so most of us fall into a volt/amp category to work with.  If this is a custom design piece they made, who's to say. Guess we will find out when the details are released.

When you say the higher voltage makes it unstable do you mean parts exploding from inductive voltage spikes?  I'm trying to think of downsides to high voltage, and if they can be fixed by a more HV tolerant vesc.

As voltage increases it's inherent traits are, induced fields increase and flashover distances decrease. Spikes also become more difficult to stabilize and keep from damaging equipment.  Our ecu  and voltage supply are at different potentials and it's all about potential management. Operating electronics at or near their limits is my biggest concern with supply and demand failure.  This is about where my pay grade ends.

I don't think the flashover distance is going to be a concern - that's more in the thousands of volts such as ESD etc where that's a concern (~1mm travel per kV)

You are right though about the fields potentially (no pun intended) causing damage.  What I think is happening is every junction you have in solid-state devices (P-N or basically a diode that exists in every FET etc) has a "standoff voltage", and the closer you get to that the more you risk breaking down.  

So just by using components a bit higher rated standoffs, or by absorbing/controlling the spikes, we can mitigate that.

My opinion is that this stuff is fairly easy to protect against, but the main thing that kills these devices is HEAT.  Granted as heat increases, those standoff voltages start to decrease and the PN junctions become more porous meaning yes, "voltage can kill" the device but it's not really the independent variable, it wouldn't have happened if the device was cool.

the problem with the VESC that i see is that it's been optimized around form factor, with a lot of heat just soaking into the components (for example FETs back to back on top of each other?) and not enough copper to actually utilize the DRV chip's thermal sinking capability.  I think for a given number of watts, running lower volts higher amps is going to cause bigger problems from heat on this particular VESC design - I could be wrong though

All good info, OK 1/10th of 1mm (for 100v let's say) is 100um, that's within the rules for trace/space gaps between copper anyways on a PCB.

Now add the insulator material (soldermask) and that number jumps way way up, so I think it's not a concern.  For example the pins on that DRV chip are hundreds of microns apart from each other.  you've got a good point when you consider little solder whiskers or some contaminants on the board.  

I think @chaka is conformal coating his VESC which is a nice touch that further protects against high voltage jumps.

To get back to the point of this thread!  Racing, uphill, is going to be such a huge expenditure of watts, that heat is going to be the huge problem to deal with.  Large thermal masses are no longer enough as they're going to soak up to their max temps in the first few minutes.  We have to attack the independent variable which is heat, generated by resistances we can optimize but can't get around, so if current squared it causing it, gotta get the current down - only way to do that and keep the same watts is VOLTS.  let's solve the problems with volts so VESCs can run at 14S :slight_smile:  That will get you up a hill

Don't get me wrong Fred I have 4 x 7s lipo packs at home (for a 14s2p battery), so I am a believer :pray:
but...
Isn't this just a cyclic argument though where 16s will be cooler than 14s or 18s cooler than 16s... because of the reduced current for said watts output.
I think their is also a jump in practicality as you start to head north of moderate to high 12s capacity loads. I mean the XT90 connector on the VESC6 speaks volumes about its max/peak capacity. Even a 7mm AS150 connector is only rated to 200A peak and you need to connect your series batteries with something that can handle the load?
I guess what I'm saying is if you push too far in any direction you run in to challenges and at this point have we actually hit a physical ceiling in any direction where by we will need a new technology to advance? 
So if we are in a game of incremental gains is there a way to jump straight to the end game?

Oui, but _why_ do you want to protect against humidity.... it's because a damp surface is no longer an "air gap" and it's easier to jump the gap if you have water, particulates, etc.  There's UL requirements around this stuff (called "creepage" lol) in the past I've even cut out holes in PCBs  (for a high voltage A.C. prescalar) to meet creepage.

I think I agree with you, but look at everyone else doing high powered e-vehicles, ebike guys start at 16S, car and boat designers are in the hundreds of volts... esk8s are all using hobby ESCs and have painted themselves into a thermal corner with the VESC.  Vedder is a great programmer but from an EE standpoint there's a lot of things that could be optimized or tweaked just a little bit to get to 14S.

As an Idea, while an downhill race would be perfect, mayby settel down with a well organised freeride event. Also safety features, cheaper and also more open. There are plenty freeride events where the focus is on fun and inlines, street ludges, freeboards and other stuff is welcome.

SPD2 just around the corner. This is a great opportunity if you ride a production board and would like see how you measure up to other production boards and riders. Open to all makes of boards and skill levels.  SPD2 will be a heat race and  main event race structure. Course design will be right and left hand turns on a closed course configuration. So get those toe and heel turns tightened up and hope to see some good production board racing. Can't wait to see what Production boards and riders will be championed on the 11th.üèÅ

Hey, may I ask you a question ?! :slight_smile:

Since you are using 4wd hubs, which I intend to do as well I got a few questions for you If you would endulge me.

So first what KV should I get, planning on 4 hummies with custom KV and I am fairly light with only 80-85KG/175LBS. The focus would be on speed, (responsible about that, seasoned downhill rider with plenty experience with speed I won't ever hit with ann esk8 and proper protective gear / leathers) but since I will be using focboxes I am limited by the max RPM. Was thinking 120kv on 90mm with a 12s5p samsung 30q as a battery. Don't think I should be going higher with the kv since I do live in switzerland with many many hills all over. But mayby 4wd is so different that a higher KV could be possible but still the RPM limit would hit in before I max the higher KV out ?! THought mayby your experience may seem something wrong with this plan :slight_smile:

I know I'm not @BigBoyToys lol, but most likely you won't have to worry about hitting your erpm limit with hubs as even with 12s and 120kv your erpm would be 42k at a full charge with no sag, which is way below the limit of 60k.

Well honestly, I would like to max out the build speed wise. Meaning as long as I am under 60k mayby like 55k and the higher KV still makes the board reasonably decent at cruising and inclines. Basically I am pretty sure that 40mph with 4wd and a 12s5p or 6p should be doable. Everything above is new teritory for me and I haven't found much information. If I would end upt with a set up that is super quick but would limit the range to 5-8 miles I wouldn't want to sacrifice usability over speed. 

Basically it should be more of a racing set upt for closed of streeets during events, around our airport with a dedicated inline/skateboard route or as a filming tool for raw runs.

I know we are generally hesitant with poeple wanting to go 50mph or more, but first of all I would not want to be riding around town like a maniac. I have actually a need for an esk8 that fast. IT would allow me to film raw runs of friends (normal downhill) and the ability to accelerate and deacelerate would mean I could get the perfect footage. And most runs we have in switzerland aren't that fast to be honest but you hit 45-55 on most of them (of course you can hit alot more on different routes and with increasing the risk you want to take). Anything faster has to be done with a car anyways.

TLDR: what is the highest KV you would recommend for a 85kg/190Lbs guy on 12s6p. Still somewhat decent range, some hill climb potential.

Ive heard there can be some issues when running very high KV's on the VESC 4.12 hardware when it comes to motor detection, startup control and high speed rotor position tracking. Since most of my personal experieice comes from low KV motors (60-192kv) I can't comment on those issues 1st hand. Thats partly why I recommemded the lower KV.  Are u willing to invest in  VESC 6's? If so you SHOULD have much more wiggle room to use a higher KV motor. 

Definitely not much info available for belt setups above 40mph and higher KV' on the VESC. You'll be using your's and our best estimates and advice to build what hasnt been built by many if any.

Using the lowest KV that will meey your speed requirement will keep the motor as cool as possible (probably still gonna be hot) and maximize your braking force. A big battery and BMS are needed to not just to supply the acceleration power but also to accept all the braking current that will be regenerated at high speeds.

I still suggest low to mid 200's for KV if using a 4.12 VESC and then adjusting the gear ratio to dial speed and braking with the available current supply and intake abilities of your set up.

Alright, Well I will be usinng hummies hubs (so no gears to play with), I think I will go with 140 to 155Kv. 

Sadly Vesc 6 is not an option for me, since this build is already a big strain on my wallet as a student. Vesc 6 would blow  it out of my budget.

I will read up further on possible BMS options for such an endevour as well as wiring for quad vesc's. 

Thank you for your input and help. I gues I will open a build thread as soon as parts are roling in in a few weeks/months.
I desperately want to take it to the next level in my DIY line up.

Opps, Sorry Ive been in Hawaii the last week and misssed that you decided on using Hummies motors. I have a 4wd hummie build in my line up and trying to decide on KV as well lol. I have 149KV Carvon V2's on 90mm wheels and have hit 49mph but they free rev to just under 70mph I just need more amps to get to a higher speed. I broke 40mph with with 2 different 130KV, 90mm wheel, hub motors as well. You are in the right ball park for your KV at 140ish. Youll need lots of power though. 18650's arent gonna cut it unless your at least 6P imo. Id suggest LIPO or better yet 26650 A123 so you can accept the higher regen currents with less concern.

Unless hummie switches to a higher pole count motor I dont think eRPM is much of a concern.

Alright :) , I see you stay true with your 4wd builds. Wanted to go carvon 4wd first, but decided for the hummies since I already have a carvon board.

Guess I also will hit a little more speed since I am a lot lighter than you and used to speed tuck anyway. 
Are you going the 18650 route for your 4wd hummie or 266650 ? I am so intrested in the a123, but kinda hesitant to build my own battery pack for a 4wd build, since it will be at its maximum. 

Have to check what both options would cost premade and if I did it myself. If the difference is to big might have to solder that thing on my own.....

Happy I am not the only one working on a hummie 4wd, let me know what KV you are going with  :)

Agreed, your weight and lower wind resistance will definately get you to a higher speed. 

Soldering the A123 was pretty challenging doing end to end style. If you have room for a bunch of 10AWG wire Id go that route but 3P would probably be the biggest you could fit and that isnt enough capacity or power for my likes.

If you go 30Q 6P youd probably be fine. I still see massive sag at under full load though. Over 6V usually.

I have a few different battery options on hand, but either 18AH 25C lipos or my 14S4P A123 pack, depending on what I end up deciding to use the hummie build for.

Yeah, well since higher voltages are the best way to make the most of the available Amps I stick high voltage packs. 

Definitely expensive, I could have bought a used car or two with the cash Ive sunk in batteries this far hahaha.

The total whr for even a big  A123 pack is pretty lame imo though, probabky only appropriate for a a higher powered high speed build that needs high regen currents. Seems double the range could be acheived with 30Q's for the same amount of space.

If you want a larger 30Q pack welded with copper pads to minimize your losses in wires, I could help out. I got a CNC welder from sunstone that can do up to .02in thick copper. 

I recently built an 16S6P pack that can do 120A continuous sagging less than 5V. It requires 8awg wire.

The road coarse layed out for  SPD2 keeps the competitors in an almost constant turn with one short arcing straight. Should be plenty of room for side by side racing. Maintaining momentum and smooth corners will be the key getting around this course. Torque helps but can get you in trouble as well.

Was a fun meet up! Lots of exciting races. Hadn't planned on racing myself but ended placing second in the custom dual and winning some ollin @chaka POPOCA wheels and pulleys. Drew was brave to race my mini board but unfortunately 3d print prototype pulley didn't hold and he ended up taking a spill. Already looking forward to the next event.

I'm working on putting our first race together. I would just post it, but after the spill, I cut it so I need to splice it together. Soon..

[quote="thisguyhere, post:471, topic:29126"]
the R2 was the fastest off the line
[/quote]

The reptor 2 even didn't want to race, i'm assuming because we already know what the the results will be, lol. Honestly, nobody really wanted to drag race. And as if to say v4's aren't fast enough, just wait for hummie v5's... 75mm long stator, 4wd, 2018...

If we had raced, I think the top drag race boards would of been:

1. evoheyax custom 4wd
2. Bigboytoys custom 4wd
3. Raptor 2

Not trying to brag, but it would have been a boring day if all we did was drag race, especially since we all kinda new what boards were all really capable of. This course was fun because it tested the riders ability. Thanks @MoeStooge for the kind words, Having skated a regular board daily for 13 years I feel like gives me a bit of an edge at times in I know how to control the board is tough situations.

It was the most fun I've ever had on an e-skate tbh. Thinking of trying to get people in SF together for a performance day now! If's a lot of planning, but with courses, we have so many options.

Next time, I'd love to do a big bigger of a course. The course was good, don't get me wrong, but I'd like something that takes at least a minute by even the fastest guy. The times were mostly very close, many within 1 second of each other. A longer course might help spread that out. Maybe test different aspect of e-skating at different parts of the course, so one type of board doesn't have an advantage also. I see a lot of potential.

Thank you @MoeStooge @Michaelinvegas @BigBoyToys for having me and setting up this great event. Can't wait for the next one!

## \#488 Posted by: michichopf Posted at: 2017-11-13T00:34:53.362Z Reads: 148

Honestly depends on the speed. At super low speeds I think bindings can be a slight advantage. As soon as we dab into more serious speeds they would be a gigantic disadvantage though, not allowing to resposition your feet and you would loose so much speed to wind since your tuck will be weird at best. 

My dream is still to race a downhill race event with our esk8ts. Implementing everything skating has to over and add our special sauce of esk8 to the mix. (guess we would frie plenty of vescs that way). You could also have an uphill category where you do the same course but upwards. A man can dream :slight_smile:

Both boards are crazy powerful. Once his board is better tuned, it will be unstoppable at a lot of events.

Yea, that fall was nasty. He's lucky not to have injured his ankles IMO, considering his board weights 50 lbs and his feet were strapped in (luckily loosely).

I think @Michaelinvegas took the worst slam of the day on @BigBoyToys 4wd carvon v3 board though. No video, at least that I know of, exists for that one though. Every time I turned around, it seemed like someone was slamming.

Yes, but this doesn't necessarily indicate that the Evolve CGT is the "fastest" board as this course test rider's ability to make sharp turns fast. Justin is obviously skilled and would probably beat me if he was riding on a potato.

Keep things in mind. The timing system was a guy with a stop watch. And definitely not an exacting science. Top riders in three different classes were within one tenth of a second from each other.  None of the top 3 we're on urethane.. The open class should happen at the next event for guys making this speed.

So urathane has great rolling resistance (though this isn't too significant a factor when racing?) and doesn't get flats whilst nummies have superior grip for cornering and higher top speed for generally being larger? I see why you glued rubber to your wheels lol

Thanks for explanation. Yeh it was possible to see that wheels started to act weird, just wasnt sure was it acceleration or what, somehow didnt think hard braking might cause it.

Anyways.. I think thats a good footage on what can happen and in what conditions, havent seen many videos with falls like this.

Good thing speed was not that high, otherwise this fall would be much more painful

We need more performance days, hopefully then we can get to the point where we can get a real racing league.

We need more to come out. It was great to get people coming from all over this past performance day, but I was hoping to have more. We need more people to be willing to spend some money to come meet up for competitions. I think we should bring them around the country, so its more fair for everyone. I can understand why people from Florida didn't come out. But if we bring it around the country, maybe we can convince people to travel from Florida to LA and from LA to Florida.

My dream would be one day, we have race tracks across the country, and have a weeding system to get the cream of the crop riders. Have an open day a few times a year for new riders to compete to get into the league. And bring the same riders around the country to compete, hyping up the local riders. The street league is a good beginning model to look at for what I'm talking about.

Be cool to have a dedicated loop timing transponder system that could be shipped and borrowed by the community for performance days across the country.  Same setup used on RC cars. @Titoxd10001 all day we had 2 scorers reading numbers off shoulders till we got to your main. The flag man was the only guy reading numbers and he was concentrating on his flagging as well.    It was my responsibility alone to secure lap counters and I take full blame for the mix-up . After reviewing the tape and score sheet. The corrected finish order was Brandon, McCloed, Derrick, Tito, David, Miguel,DNF Neil

I would say anything other than that tight road course is going to be better with thane. Of course a very skilled rider would be able to come in hot and drift into the apex and blow your doors off. Rubber has been tested throughout the decades in skateboarding and it just doesn't have the special sauce we need in a performance skateboard wheel.

Agreed! It was obvious who would have the advantage on this course. I actually called the winner 15 minutes into the event lol 

@BigBoyToys will tell you that the single straightaway was big enough to stretch his legs (and shoulder and neck) but the turns were penny board tight. 

All in all, This event topped the last one! It was a blast. We just need to find that balance between speed and carve. This event favored rider skill hands down. Justin could have pulled off his win on any pneumatic.  Next event should maintain that demand while also allowing the boards to open up.

My advice may sound weird at first but hear me out.
You have so many bigger and smaller downhill and freeride events in  the states, it is crazy. Get together with a freeride event for start not downhill race. What this gives you is a venue with drivable road, closed off road, safety features, medics and a course which will be a real challenge.  On Freeride events are all sorts of stuff happeninng such as inline skates, luges and freeboards etc. Bring 2 communities together and I am sure annyone there would be happy to see your machines and may have 1-2 tips for you on the race course. Alot would be easier (infrastructur, space, route etc)

If you would ever wannt to go down that road and need a liason or just general information let me know.

Outdoor kart tracks are all asphalt. Some of it *rubber impregnated.

Indoor ones are concrete.

*The rubber comes from the kart tires, and offers great traction.

You can see it in the corners.

Unless there's a huge roster, there's no way you'd have to rent the track ($$$$)

Could probably get in on a track day.
It would just be another group. 
Depending on how busy it is, could be just 3 groups.

You get 15 minute sessions every 40 minutes or so. 

Track days are ~$40-50 per rider. 
EMT on site
Waivers to sign
Tech inspection 
Gear requirements, idk.. maybe full face helmets required.
Leathers, or some guys wear MX gear on supermotos.
They may want to see us in some kind of boots, idk..

I emailed the track boss about eskate track options, waiting to hear back from him. 

The local track in Sacramento @prairie city ohv is closed today, I'll call them tomorrow and see what's up. 

Their track rental will be a fair bit cheaper than Sonoma I'm sure. 

But still spendy.

And it's a better track in some respects..

I gotta say on our short track the qualifying numbers and finishing orders speak clearly as to what is faster through turns. Grippy rubber or slippery special sauce. Sliding has never and will never be a faster way to negotiate a turn at any speed ever. It looks cool to slide and takes a fantastic amount of talent, but it's will never beat grip.  The down hill guys have to balance between roll resistance and grip to make speed, that IS special sauce and a completely different dynamic than what Esk8 is capable of. On a larger track the urethane guys are going to have even a bigger time gap. All you guys are going to laugh boo and shake your heads at this next comment but you will all remember it when it happens. One day an esk8 on rubber will beat a good downhiller on thane to the bottom heads up no contest.

Even if what you say is true I would still rather ride a skateboard. ;) Saying any board with skateboard wheels needs it's own class in a skateboard race speaks volumes. You should really spend more time on an actual DH board and research why we need narrow trucks with a ton of response. Some day you will wish your board had some twitch and predictable drift. 

FYI, this dude is buttboarding and has you beat! I wonder... would it need a special class if it was lean steer?

Spent a few years racing karts on dirt ovals and I'm stretching my imagination to see what one has to do with the other. Can't seem to find enough similarities between a kart and an E-sk8 raceboard.  Up till now downhill has been our inspiration and guidelines when building an esk8 for speed. There is a definite beauty and elegance to the unpowered flight of downhill, esk8 racing is not going to change downhill.  There is no doubt the guys/gals who do it are skilled and fearless. Just making a point that esk8 racing is a different dynamic than Downhill. The roots of the esk8 however are undeniable.

 You seem to disregard anything but a tiny road course. Do you really think you can out brake someone how can drift into a turn? Electric brakes suck so you are going to lose when you need to start braking early. A lot of your assumptions are based on an extremely limited field of view.  I guess you could add a mechanical brake but I think you would need to make a special class.

In my opinion,that gocart has a lot in common with your build. Rubber tires instead of skate wheels, tubular steel frame instead of a board... He even had a DOT approved helmet! :joy:

Well I understand your argument and your thoght behind it, but I have to strongly disagree. 

The main problem we face in downhill isn't roll resistance. Anything that has a little more drag like bad bearings, to tight nuts or wider wheels are so negligable in comparison on how good you tuck, how long you can tuck (tuck downtime essentially) and your skill. Thane isn't used because of lower resistance it is used since it allows you to cheat out your lanes and give you a reliable feedback. Will get to that.

So, following scenario, I am doing 60 on a straight drop comming up to a 180 Degree turn which is rather sharp. What the thane wheels allow me is to keep my speed up until the turn. Then when my radius would be huge because of my speed i can predrift the corner into the apex, then release the drift in a slide and cut the corner and shoot out the other side. Anything aproaching that corner on big rubber tires has serious problems. He needs to slow down so much, that his radius is small enough to make the turn. 

Ps: its not as much a problem in downhill on how much speed you can build up, it is having the right equipment to survive the road ahead with the speed. 
@chaka what you said about trucks is absolutely right in my opinion. 

I can mayby showcase this in a video and show you the difference in speed when i try to grip all corners or if I allow drifts/slides /speedchecks.


Also I wanna see anyone doing this on tires ;)

Looking at the progress the esk8 community has made, which you have been a great contributor of in tall standing. You after all people should see more clearly forward than most. The reliability, the brakes, the performance, the range is getting better every day.  Performance testing will tax these limits and bring better parts to Joe Cruiser. Not being a purest allows me not to be tied to tradition of wood decks, narrow trucks or slippery thane.  We are all governed by the same rules of physics and Dynamics when we ride. My approach is defined by what I want my results to be. I'm going to use all the tools in my toolbox to achieve the results I see as reasonable and reachable. It may be hard to move forward if your feet get stuck in tradition. As for the DOT helmet. When you think about the skate helmets out there reported cracking. I will take all the ridicule you want to give, cause at the end of the day it gives me the best chance of walking away from it so I can get up and do it again.

wheels wider (Abec 83mm!?!, Venom 70mm, Cult 66mm...)
softer (73a Cult raptures, 74a Venom magnums...)

all to chase more grip cause traction is king...

Yeah, absolutely true. With a racing set up sliding ain't much fun. Definetly hurts on your leggs from the braking force. Thats why there are slide wheels, freeride wheels, fun wheels and grip wheels.(did you know that we can actually stop faster than a formula 1 car from 70 to 0, all that energy in your leggs.) 

And boards have gotten a lot shorter in the last years. All pro models and top end decks are short, for a tall spaghetti like me (196cm) almost too short. But there are allways so many exeptions to the rule. You still see longer boards, dropped down, and tiny wheels within the top 100. 

Of course wider wheels go so well together with shorter trucks!

Exactly, thats why for different races you have different wheels, mayby even different bushing sets.

Anyway it was a nice mixture of skill, acceleration and turning. But hardly racing or downhill related. There needs to be difficulties at top speed.

You gotta factor the crush factor too. Use a proper helmet for the sport.

Virtually all race cars are drifting to a curtain extent. If your wheels are not breaking loose a little you aren't pushing the limits. 

Fact is rubber wheels are slow as F%$#. You might be happy to proclaim rubber is the best on the equivalent of a dmv test course but we are going to see the qualities of urethane in overall performance on a faster track. Remember, you are not the first person to try rubber on a skateboard.

Will it work the same over all types of road conditions out there in the real world where we all ride all the time?

i had this argument with my son last night. it went somethign like this. 

me: i'm going to invent this chassis type device that sprays glue on printing labels from a regular locktitght spray glue can and lets you use plain copy paper to make shipping labels. And it stamps out the label from the rest of the paper so its thew right size. 

him: what a waste of time. buy sticky labels

me: yeah ok i'll pay 100x the amount of money for half the amount of paper instead of profiting from a cheap plastic device that lets anyone make sticky back mailing labels from shit they have around the house already for a hundreth of the cost of those stupid stickers. 

him: yeah but who's gonna buy that when they can just buy stickers

me: Probably the people that know that a whole ream of copy paper and a can of loctite spray glue cost 100 times less than that fucking label pack from office depot

him: yeah.. but... huh. 

me: that attitude kept us on horses when that dude was building the steam engine. IT burned books. It subjugated you. 

him: ...

me: get me a beer.

The local track in Sacramento @prairie city ohv is closed today, I'll call them tomorrow and see what's up.

I talked to someone at the kart track a little while ago.

She said she would be more inclined to pursue it if it was going to be more than just a one-off event.


They already have insurance for karts and supermotos, but she would have to check if e-skateboards could be added to those existing policies.

She quoted me $1,200 for a half day on a saturday plus the ambulance cost  (~$300)  if their insurance company requires one. 

Also, I asked her about allowing us in on a track day, instead of renting the track, and she said if it was on a weekday, that it was possible, but she didn't seem to want to bother with it.
Definitely didn't want to take track time away from the karters on a busy weekend to let us play.

Overall, she didn't seem too interested in making it happen, but $$ talks.

@Cobber Do we need to start a new thread for long distance/high speed racing? I don't want to be seen as a hater just because I like a race that tests a rider's endurance and skill. 

I can't think of anything better than a team of riders with 1 or 2 guys on 1:1 beasts hiding in the draft till the last few miles. The finish would be fast and exciting for the spectator. This type of racing will naturally grow from long range group rides and meet ups.

I know for a fact that 2 riders touching butts is faster than one if they work together and punch a hole in the wind as one.

@MoeStooge   The FreeRide deck is 25mm. Going to a maximum chord of 28mm will allow boards with enclosures within the class. I think stipulations like this will push better design.

It doesn't limit the pool of riders once you all grow a pair and step up to the challenge, quit bringing the mountain down to your size and rise to the occasion...30 mile race is already planned and it was a compromise to allow for more people to enter.

dude way back in the post count on this thread I suggested you guys find a banked velodrome used for racing track bicycles... there are a heap of different existing track race types that would be fun on a eSk8, You want drafting... spectacle to watch... plus hooking 45 degree banked corners at full tilt is a rush!

more rules and red tape is always shit, but it might turnout @MoeStooge is too good a builder, you might need to make some extra rules to put him in his own class cause no one can beat him...

thanks for pointing that out, they have been racing Le Mans for 100 years on a course that is still used for public roads, thank you for this perfect example of what I am saying!!

The Circuit des 24 Heures du Mans,[1] also known as Circuit de la Sarthe[2] (after the 1906 French Grand Prix triangle circuit) located in Le Mans, Maine, France, is a semi-permanent race course chiefly known as the venue for the 24 Hours of Le Mans auto race. Comprising private, race-specific sections of track in addition to public roads which remain accessible most of the year, its present configuration is 13.629 kilometres (8.469 mi) long, making it one of the longest circuits in the world. Capacity of the race stadium, where the short Bugatti Circuit is situated, is 100,000. The Mus√©e des 24 Heures du Mans is a motorsport museum located at the main entrance of the venue.

It does limit the pool since I could compete in any form of race atm. Exept long distance. The luxury of having multiple boards for multiple uses is not standard at all. So in logic limits the amount of people that can participate.

Range is but one characteristic of a long range race setup needed or best for cross country real world problems. I think it actually lends well to a completely balanced setup, with high speed, lots of range and the ability to maneuver and deal with real world conditions and road surfaces. I'm not looking to improve long range eskates, I'm actually looking to challenge the entire convention of what is good and push all aspects to be better, only way to do that is to challenge ourselves in every aspect. The distance should be pushed each year, the speeds or the difficulty of the courses. I just prefer to start at the challenges presented out there already, and overcome them. Creating a closed course under controlled conditions does not challenge the builders and riders with things we have not come across yet. The unexpected, the dynamic world, is challenge enough already, we should step up and spank it with 50 mile races for the big boys. We are not really racing each other until your boards improve in all aspects and reach a plateau in performance and standards are reached through a naturally occurring consensus. I am proposing to accelerate that innovation by throwing ourselves at challenges worth our time.

2 points really.
As long as it isn't a controled enviroment, nothing race related will happen. Nor any real competition, fights and super ambitious riders. (if anyone had the idea to hold a race or and freeride/downhill event on a public road with traffic, his career in that industry, his reputation and all sponsors would be dead instantly.

Secondly,  90% of poeple don't think about a marathon when talking about racing. The most discussed are 100m sprint, formula 1 etc. 
Mayby we shouldn't gear towards a sub genre as a goal. (a 12s6p set up will be so heavy, that I would be uncomfortable at 60+).

Racing is skill, balls and respect within a controled enviroment. With safety features, medics, and riders who respect eatch other. 
Open road? Rough surface?  "Dynamic world"?  Sounds more like a survival game to me than something that is aspiring to be a sport, with sponsors who can get behind it. Family fathers and mothers who would join amd shred hard. 
I mean I like mad max movies as well, but hell no, not with me as a protagonist in it.

I have however been running some range and efficiency tests with my 1600whr trampa, they arent looking good. My carvon board can do 60 miles with the energy it takes this board to go 20miles. I wont have enough juice to make a 5000' climb even if my motors and speed controllers could dissipate the heat. Have any of you done any heavy climbing tests for more than a mile or two and calculated consumption? My 4wd spur set up is sucking about 50whr/mile on the flats and going up over 100+ whr/mile during heavy climbing. I'd love to hear what you guys are finding for climbing consumption.

I heard about a place called Suger Loaf Mountain near where i live. I heard it has a hill worthy of cyclists all around. I want to go to there.

If your deck is thicker than 28mm or has a wheelbase longer than 900mm we will need to make a special class for you.:wink:
[/quote]

How about IDF dimensions. Isn't this more like what we would like to emulate. 35" wheel base seems kinda unfair to a guy like @BigBoyToys   <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/7/4/74096bbf6ef5b4a7bd635dde9c29fa7973fc14db.png" width="281" height="500">.  
Maby you wanna limit the Watt Hours as well.  Wheel Size, Motor, Rider Weight. Yuck!

BBT is like 4X your weight dude :muscle: taller :house: next size up in people

while 27" is more than enough for a manlet, it is moderate for those over 6'
plus there are not many people going fast <25"... you might as well just race in a stock class... like production... if you want it that narrow?

seriously though, If you open up the gear box how do the spurs look? Is the lube still clean, any signs of wear? 
A fraction more backlash might quieten them up a bit and reduce wear at the same time ;)

Did you see the bracket Jenso made for a motorbike steering stabilizer?
I'm thinking I might get one...

Im actually running more lash than Jens instructions called for, I dont think it will be getting any quiteter. It was quite the transition coming from dead silent FOC hub builds to this screamer but I think the sound matches the perfomance so Im OK with it. There's really nothing stealth about this board. 

I wish someone would hurry up and make some 8" pneumatic hub motors worth using so I can have my cake and eat it to.

Yes Ive been eyeballing jens stabilizer project, I think he got the idea from @MoeStooge

Had a high torque single on a set of standard reverse 180mm  trucks. I didn't like the torque steer under hard accel and brake . I wanted to make speed so torque steer had to go.  Three link is a 100% mechanical no slop no play adjustable steering system derived from rear steer used in dirt track auto racing with some adaptations to make a tilt steer device. It's allows for 1 1/4" ride height adjustment and turn adjustability from 9' radius on a 42" wheelbase board to 2deg for high speed stability. Axle can be built to accept belt, gear or hub motor. Axle width is what ever you want it to be and can be changed in a few minutes, all hardware gets reused. What I don't have yet is different durometer bushings. That's about it.

Well stance is the biggest imao. Whatever I did, monoski, snowboarding or downhill/freeride, stance was allways facing forward. Having my hips and torso against the direction I am going kills every sense of security for me.

Bindings feel weird as well though. I move around so much on my deck, even on my esk8. Having that movement restricted felt terrible honestly.

Just a note to your crash.
I guess when you use different brake power on the front and rear truck (e.g. 70% front and 30% back) the instability at braking might can be eliminated.

The video is in german but it shows the difference when the front blocks and when the back blocks.

Only serious sessions I had was when I let downhill mates use a second board of mine. We do alot of group rides with the esk8 squad but mostly very chill.

And I mean, we are in switzerland, more or less the riders paradise in the world. Our standards are so high that all roads are ridable, even beautiful mountain passes etc... (brb finding likeminded poeple).

Allright. Took my own advice. Got in contact with multiple freeride events, 4 immidiately agreed to host us as a seperate category for a race. And since 4 times a day everyone is down and needs to get back up, we also get an uphill race. Theoretically we got 4 races now, mayby I can get it to 5, then we could have a seirous competition over the events. (in central europe/ switzerland).

I'm just a noob spitting ideas but I feel like ideally you would want a mixture with esk8.  What you've started is great.  Maybe down the line it isn't too much trouble to have a line that splits off the DH track slightly.  But no reason doing that before you even get started.

For pure DH everyone starts with empty batteries!

Of course it is not ideal. But to get open road closed off, with safety nets, medics and support staff for an esk8 event is far fetched if not impossible atm. We have no real sponsors, no established racing circuit. So my thought was is hang on to the mothershipp that is freeride/downhill. Get more attention and coverage. Join forces and as soon as we have enough traction, money and influence we spread our wings and fly solo into the sunset.

I like the idea of hitching our wagon to the existing industry and events, that's a great idea. I'm just in favor of the eskating events being eskating and showing what these things can do, not just small aspects. Using an electric to go down a hill is somewhat pointless considering they do it just fine without a motor. Doing hill climbs are just that, very narrow in scope and somewhat specialized. I would prefer a cross country race over some distance to display the abilities of what we can do. Including going up and down hills, and around tight corners and over a long distance...get the existing industry to buy into the right idea, and you'll have my support. I'm afraid many of their venues are all catered to downhill only, where rolling or flatter terrain may be hard to find adjacent to these events. But it's worth a shot dude..send it..

we need streets but we need them empty. 

We need neighborhoods that aren't built yet and have stagnated, or an abandoned golf course, or a fairgrounds in the off season. OR a cooperative golf course. 

I say golf courses because country clubs have well paved and interestingly curved cart roads intermingled with wavy terrain.and often a couple of miles of it at least.

No room for passing unless you get on the grass though.   I think races on dirt will be the easiest to setup.   Could pack it hard if you wanted.  It's also better if you fall.  Pavement/concrete is expensive to maintain and you pay for it or it's being used.

There is room to pass, you just get a single car width lane instead of two.

Riding a golf course would be super fun.  It's fun just riding around in a golf cart.  I like the ideas of nice grass on the sides of the track too, haha.  You have to admit the lanes are pretty narrow though.  Maybe passing would still be possible but there's only one way to find out.  I could see lots of wipeouts on turns.

it also depends on the course. Some have narrower lanes than others. 

Head to head racing with passes and teams and all that would be difficult there, true, but time trial style grand prix would work very, very well. With delays in start times and using the times to judge, passing would be reduced to a thrilling sideshow that could happen at any moment depending on how arrogant the rider is. 

It would be a lot of fun to watch.

Yeah agree with what you said. 
But before we can go big and crazy we need the riders. If you have enough poeple (e.g:40-60) and want to do an event, things are getting a lot easier. Usually the rate for an event is around 70-130$ for 2 days here with 2 hot meals per day. (switzerland/france/germay all around that number). With 40 poeple = gives you around 4'400.- (after meal and food costs) and about the same amount from sponsors and patrons of sorts. With that you can pay farmers around for delivering bales of straw to secure rocks, walls etc. Then another part goes to the public school and firefighters who deliver gymnnnastic mats of various sorts to secure posts, mountain walls, tunnel entrace and other sketchy shit on tight turns and parts where speed are going to be high. Then the rest of the money is used for  medical staff, an ambulannce on point, organisation, time measurinng instruments and the whole clean up of the event afterwards.

As soon as you organise something official in europe, you are bound by law to generate a safe space for that event. So I don't see that ever happening at the moment around my parts. The man hours to organise, the money and the poeple aren't there yet.

Do you guys like ride your skateboards for fun? Like where do you ride them? What type of terrain or trails or roads and for how long? I bet if you got a good sample of what people do for fun, you might find what will interest people for a race. All this hill climb talk and closed race courses sounds like dudes who never go out and ride or enjoy the existing world to ride through...the eskate racing should reflect real world electric skateboarding, do you do any? Or is this all about racing and you just race or come up with new races? I'm trying to find the essence or spirit or culture and ethics here and it's all over the map, there is no uniformity to any of this and maybe you can find some consensus in reporting what you do enjoy for the fun of it...at the end of the day if it ain't fun, no one will show up..so what do they (including you and I) all do for fun right now with your eskate? I ride the shit out of mine, miles and miles and explore the trails and roads all over town, I simply love it and I cannot wait for the next ride and I hate poor weather now, like a surfer hates little waves...are you guys skaters? or just racers? Are you interested in riding and enjoy it for the sake of it, or are you here just to beat others in a race? I'm curious what ethics this is trying to be built on...seems like lots of made up things for the sake of making them up while ignoring the reality...most eskaters are just commuting...like 80% of buyers, right? you want people to come, cater to them, not the exceptions. Not to mention, this is skateboarding, I would learn the history of skateboarding and find how this new genre of it, fits into the existing culture and what it can use and take and bound off of for the future..

Nobody wants to watch me cruising at 18mph shirtless and barefoot with a bag of skittles, but that's what i do for fun. Usually on wooded paved trails. I'm an attractive guy, so maybe some people would like to watch that, but i wouldn't call it an event. I mean ask my wife and she'll tell you its a fucking event trying to get me to do anything i don't want to, like put a damn shirt on. Or shoes.  There are plenty of people that would watch that event. Just look at the numbers for those stupid reality shows people watch because they're so disappointed in their own depressing lives. 

distance and moderate casual speed are what's fun and relaxing for me. carving back and forth down a windy ass canopy road. Boring as a spectacle unless you're an artist appreciating my form and its fluid movements. 

People watch races for a very different reason than those people have for participating in them. I watch them for the off chance of a crash. Also, for the hot dogs and soda and other fair foods they have at events like that. I also like to get a glimpse of the vehicles and riders, talk to people, kick over the porta-potties when somebody takes too long in them, all that good stuff.

and you are trying to convince the real racers they shouldn't race on a track and they should race on the streets, cause you race to work and you think you are really fast and you have lots of fun so they should come and try it too and it will be really popular and everyone will come and try?
Do you think you will come across as smart, skilled or fast?
as for ethics you keep suggesting we race on open roads???

I sure am, 1st one is next month...open road race...  https://www.facebook.com/events/544498112609078/

I'm all for pirate and gorilla open road races...we ride at our own risk all the time, or at least I do...come on and join me for a run, race like we ride, shirt off, with a beer, who cares..I do not believe eskate races will ever become a spectator sport. It's a sport to experience and will bring participants, not observers. I saw this through experience, I actually helped create drone racing as you know it, which is now on TV and and funded by Disney..."sports" and non-sport competitions, like sport climbing, surfing, skateboarding, snowboarding all all subjective competitions of style, snowboard racing around gates lasted only a few years before people realized it's lame and uncool..even ultra skate races are more for fun and the challenge, not beating the other people but testing oneself and there's zero spectators and I bet you barely heard of it, but people travel the world to do it...I believe that racing without ethics, is not really worth doing, especially in skating considering it's never been about what you do or how fast you are, but how you do it, and in what style (like having your shirt off, or shoes off and bombing a steep hill in San Fransisco)...skating is all style, always has been, always will be...style lives in ethics..not your speed, your time or your ranking..if you don't use style when riding a skateboard then all your doing is standing on a toy plank with wheels...your speeds and ranges start to be meaningless without ethics..

Honestly, while hillclimbs sound brutal, and downhill e-sk8 racing sketchy af, it also sounds like a lot of fun. 



I mean, bandaging up wounds while you are warming up burritos with your motors, what more could you want?

Not to be ruled out, some of the best and twistiest roads on earth don't have much elevation change or traffic, some of them are even banked and shit.

I guess my quest involves finding the "style" of electric skateboarding worthy of being considered cool or acceptable by the rest of the existing skateboarding world..Rodney Mullin was once considered a freak, watching his freestyle antics and now look, the entire world of skateboarding preforms his many inventions everyday. Jay Adams would demonstrate a smooth surfing flow that you all take for granted to this day, like simply riding that way has always been, but it wasn't. He just did it, never cared about what people thought really, and look how it is appreciated and still holds value to this day, they couldn't even find a way to score him at his 1st competitions, and adding brushless power to this toy should be a ground breaking renaissance on how we view the toy, what we can do with it, and what new style and ethics it creates in the skateboarding world? Sure we can all ride one, stand on it, roll around and carve, go fast or slow, go far or on a course...but where's the style? What are the ethics? What I am saying is that numbers are boring...numbers don't last like the stance of Jay Adams dropping a bank or doing a Burt...skating has never been about numbers really, unless your talking about world records and that's sort of a personal thing and not really a race or an event...where is the downhill skateboarding that use to be in the Xgames and all that? Do they still do it? or did the audience get bored already? It simply isn't sustainable, so find out what it sustainable and lasting..in my opinion, it's the innovative styles and ethics you have yet to invent around a badass thing, the powered skateboard..I think you guys are actually selling it short..it's actually the best personal mode of transportation I have even seen and I would start with focusing on the freedom and experience the toy provides, show that off, show case it through races or events and that will entice people..as it's what brings people to buy them already..The Chinese have one things going them in this market...they are marketing to the right consumer, but they are forgetting style..and that's why skaters hate electric skateboards...no coolness, no style, no ethics...meaning no substance behind those numbers...

No, ethics is what retains the standard of style, it helps define for everyone what is cool and what isn't. Like if I said "Bob is rad dude cus he just shredded down the road in front of the school naked in front of all the children" You might disagree and say, hey that's not cool, making that style unethical within our culture as it maybe should be. But if I say "Did you see Bob's video of him jamming through traffic for 10 miles without shoes through NY city the other day?" and you say, yeah that was rad, then our culture would define that as a rad style of skateboarding and a great example of it's use. Consensus, peer review, opinion and culture can and will create the definitions of what is cool and what isn't, and then ethics of the community enforce them. The rock climbing community functions that way, as sport climbing, is either and sort of a joke. It's a way to self regulate a non-sport sport, like say cheer leading...lol They have cheer leading competitions right? Is cheer leading a sport? what numbers do they care about in a cheer leading competition? I'm curious..

Anyway. your Idea may be fun. Has absolutely nothing to do with racing. It is a survival game on esk8. And frankly, knowingly taking risks on public roads with an esk8 for competitions sake is fuqing stupid and absurd. If you race or compete in something the limiting factor should be your skill, not how stupid you can make yourself for a few hours to "race" on a public fuqing road. Endagering others, causing stress factors for others, being an inconsiderate human because style... and you talk about ethics? even if its in the completely wrong context anyway but still...

Something to loock at, this is what it is about, respect for others, family like bonding, and a ton of fun.

I think of downhill as just one of the 40 genres of skateboarding..I guess I'm thinking more holistically...The fact that the DH guys are getting major props from the existing skate world now is a fine example, they have balls and shred hard..but there was hate for years..that hate and divide between existing skateboarding culture and what you guys are trying to do, is a gap...a huge giant gap...and I don't think the existing skateboarding world is going to just stop hating without action or change, I think the eskaters need to become cool, change it up and try new things or at least embrace what they are and what they do (commute)..my hope is that eskating becomes cool someday for skaters, as it has for me..I'm not an electric skateboarder, I'm just a skateboarder and I own about 30 of them made for all kinds of things and styles of riding it;s something I have made effort to study. The electric skate is just another skate to me...How do I ride it in the best style, in the coolest way? Do you guys know yet? Have your races or events formed a consensus yet? Is it designed too? Just things to think about...

I am organizing small cross country events, I didn't even call it a race, but whoever get there 1st, gets the sponsors prizes...seems the sponsors like the idea, so if you want the prize participate, come do what you do anyway and ride your board. I'm not trying to attract people, I'm trying to prototype "cool"...cus that's what is sustainable, that's what will drive future innovation and products and human interest. Open roads are not just open roads, they are allies, bike paths, anything smooth to get you from point A to B, we are not limited to roads just as much as we are not limited to closed courses. My event is a choose your own adventure with multiple paths, including a bike trail the entire length of the 30 mile course, whether you use it and risk law enforcement is up to you but it's there if your more afraid of cars, that's the whole point...that's what makes it cool...not the part where it's a bunch of nerds standing on toys and recording numbers...lol

And having spent my entire life on a skateboard and witthin the various communities, I have never heard anyone hating downhill. What ever you may dislike about the sport it is hard to diss something liek this [BEAUTY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OpVjD0zP_E&t=241s) or this  [best of the best](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OmA-8kcl_w&t=126s).

I really don't want this to turn out into a pissing contest. But arguments have been made from many people that it doesn't matter how asweome your idea is if it come after "public road". (and I commute everyday back and forth twice. Still I ride as much as possible away from main roads or public roads). Never got the midset of feeling boss, like a G or awesome disturbinng the public, gerating risk on others and being a genuine ass. I ride alot on public roads up to 80km/h regularly. I do my best to allways be friendly, have talks with locals to get them engaged with us rather than the police for no reason. And since we are on a public road there is no point in stressing out a car around you that could kill you. As soon as we even spot a kid, a dog or anything out of the ordinary its chill time, down to 15-20 and pass slowly. No need to endager other just because you feel steez about it, ever. Nothinng about that is cool, its just moronic.( And no it HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH ETHICS?!!!!)

Why am I such a mama's boy or "pussy" you may ask. Well you know having to bury dead friends because they wanted to be cool and go over board on public roads kinda changes you. There are times to unleash your inner beast, your speed demon or whatever holy force is possesing you. That though is for events, specially organised days just for that purpose. Just like the perfomance day. Just imagine the fall of @BigBoyToys on a public road with cars around. They did so much right. They had fun, finaly sparked a discussion about racing and competing. 

But stuff like 

 -   I'm trying to prototype "cool"
 -  whether you use it and risk law enforcement is up to you 
( NO MAN, not ever. I am sorry but if you ever want to have anyone take any approach seriously you cannot shit on rules, law annnd public order, we all were 16 year old skaters doing random shit, this time is over man).
 -  if your more afraid of cars (:confused: :neutral_face::expressionless:)
 - not the part where it's a bunch of nerds standing on toys and recording numbers
(those nerds are the guys who came up with the vesc, push the innovation you so much seem to care about further. Help out the community upgrading our rides and provide the fundation for knowledge and learning process...)

I mean common dude. Then right at the beginning you throw in holistic, Are we having an argument over doctrins or the effort for an integrated view? or about the consideration of desease treatment ? wuut you lost me there. Throwing in ethics, cool, style or rad also :confused:

  Help where am I Hello anybody there ?

As for "shitting on rules" I am more of a civil disobedience supporter, especially when it comes to safety, if breaking a law is safer than not, I will always break the law and fight the law later. Roller skates and electric bikes are allowed on the trails while skateboards (powered or not) are not allowed. this is a very unfair use case for a tax payer funded resource, wouldn't you say?  I'm actual working with the county parks and rec. now to allow skateboards and change the laws, I provide data and a use case. The facts and common sense are on my side, that's why the LEOS and rangers out on the trail let me break the law, they recognize the law's flaws as well, and they support me riding there and trying to change the laws. They understand me on the trail means me not getting hit by a car and them having to clean it up. You can do what you wish to do, but when I find problems I try to fix them, you don't have to do it, or support me, but please don't put me down for trying to make things better or having the passion to act on my beliefs. This is a new activity and law makers and regulators have not been challenged or even analyzed the facts surrounding eskating to make sound decisions. I grew up in a world where we couldn't skateboard anywhere, now those same lawmakers spend millions to build us skateparks, why? Skateboarding has always been a banned, outlawed and discriminated against, being a pirate and skating spots, even in professional videos is a part of the culture of skateboarding and always has been, I personally embrace that spirit and use it to help gain access for electric skateboarders. To be honest though, I just do it for me, so I can ride the trails without being harasses by bikers and law enforcement and enjoy the public resource like all user-groups. Supposedly there's a 2k fine for skating the trails, I just get a friendly wave. You never know till you try and skating has a lot to do with trying, and falling down and getting back up again..I can hack it, I love everything about skating, including getting kicked out of parking lots for playing with my toy at 40 year old, it keeps me young, lol

I'm gonna be honest.  I didn't write everything you wrote.  Don't have time for it.  Also, paragraphs.

But if I was to start a race on live roads and goaded people into it saying it was the only real race I would feel responsible for if someone got hurt.  You also risk drivers who have to avoid you.

So you would take on the personally responsibility of others? Why would you do that? It's called personal responsibility for a reason...dude there's a line between what I do and what you do and you have zero control over what I do, to even propose you have control over my actions for any reason is just weird, it shows a very skewed sense of reality if you think having an event takes personal responsibility from people, lol. I expect anyone riding with me to take responsibility for themselves, just like every single human on this earth regarding any subject..personal responsibility is just that, to treat it any differently is taking control from those people...and if they understood it, they wouldn't appreciate it..You are also saying people are too stupid to govern themselves...which is something I do not subscribe too at all..I think I found the problem here, and is has nothing to do with skating or racing, lol..and if your going to attack me and call me a harmful person, you best read what I wrote before you reply..

I feel like real world races are dangerous if the route isn't sanctioned off and the roads aren't in good condition.

I might go to the event in Sac, I might not. The reason being that the risk of injury if you want a shot at winning is high. I can't do 35 mph on roads I don't know the condition of without a huge risk of falling. It's honestly the same case with side by side racing. After I saw @BigBoyToys slam, I was noticeably more cautious for the rest of the race.

The safest racing is timed laps on a controlled course. You know the condition of what your riding on and don't have the risk that another guy is going to wipe you out. Then, I feel I can really push the boundary of what my board can do.

In any other race, I feel like it's a huge risk of injury, and I've had more injuries (and surgeries) than I can handle for a life time and I'm only 24, haha.

I totally agree, where we wish to push the technology of the boards is a controlled course environment.BUT where we wish to push the ability of the rider, we want the unexpected for them to deal with...If we were just racing boards we would just make them like RC cars and make an RC car track and completely omit the riders...but this approach includes the riders ability, decision making skills and the board function, all combined into one test. It is more dangerous, it is harder, and that's the whole point..wheel choices will be really interesting to see, route choices and different tactics in routes will be very very interesting to see. I have a home field advantage, I have done at least one of the routes available, and I can easily provide any and all info you guys ask, and I'll even go out and run a road if you wish to know it;s condition before the ride, but it might give away your route to the others, lol I'm open source, and I am sure someone will beat me 30 miles...I go slow...but wait till the the 50 miles race...I might start having an endurance advantage considering I've been training 50+ mile rides regularly...I focus on the riding, safety, routes, laws and distance...speed is down on my list of priorities while some of you can bring it all already and spank me...without a doubt...

The whole point is that exactly this point is stupid, bonkers, mad, crazy, idiotic.... In what universe is more danger in any form good?  If you were ever really really testing your limits, pushed past your boundry of fear. Into a few moments of pure emotions and sensations. The realisation what you just did is overwhelming seconds after.You would know what an inherent fear for life is. Not because you almost hit a car, just out of the sheer sensory overload. It is such a strong sensation that your whole body shuts down, your legs don't work, you piss yourself out of reflex and you are left in a state of absolute terror. But yeah lets add some more of that INTENTIONALLY and not based on our sport but as a fun flavour because racing on safe roads is for wusses.

Yeah, like if we are just casualy racing our boards at 100 down a narrow path, on shit pavement with the competition right behind you, that is boring. Lets make it rc... I mean where is the skill, the riders ability in this?  (https://youtu.be/GSUgehJWznw) total snooze fest right?!  (sarcasm)

Push the ability of the rider we want the unexpected?  Wuut?  So if I shoot you with a tranquilizer while you are riding is that unexpected enough for you?  If you are pushings your abilities, exeeding your experince you should still only do it in safe spaces. 

A road with its laws is a system. If you feel like you are that much more important than everyone else, that just for you the rules are different and you can zoom around in traffic and feel good about it then how my father would say :" he needs something in his life son, let him be an idiot in public so he is at least something"

I have a question.  I think this stems from my lack of understanding about the dynamics of radius and how it applies to rotation, anyways here it is.

Why doesn't a 150mm wheel (pneumatic) with 60T pulley go faster than a 100mm wheel that's thane with a 36T pulley?  Is it the gear ratio?  I think it is, but If so why not use 36T pulleys on 6in wheels?
```

---
## \#792 Posted by: Youssless Posted at: 2017-12-05T16:15:09.635Z Reads: 126

```
@mmaner Yes, its the gear ratio. Assuming you're using the same motor pulley (let's say 12T for this example), 3 motor turns would equal 1 turn of the 100mm wheel whilst the same number of motor turns would provise 60% of a turn for the 150mm wheel. 60% of 150mm wheel is 283mm whilst a full turn of a 100mm wheel is 314mm. The same number of turns, in the same time covers more distance so the 100mm wheel must have travelled faster.

I'm not sure why people don't use 36T pulleys, perhaps since 6in wheels are normally used for mtb, they want more torque rather than top speed?

Thats prolly it, I really like AT wheels but for the comfort level and the fact that I don't have to pay as much attention to the surface directly in front of me.  But nothing beats the feel of thane on fresh asphalt.

I agree, but it's harder than it sounds. For one, you can't go over the erpm limit of your esc's. This is an advantage for hub motors. VESC6 might be needed. Also, 4wd would help give that extra push at high speeds and put less strain on the esc's. Really, it's most important to over engineer a bit, cause no one wants to fall at those speeds.

I talked to @MoeStooge at SPD2 about adapting his trucks for hummies hubs. Maybe we could work together to get some higher kv with larger wheels on them for a record attempt.

Hummies on a three link sounds like an awesome idea. Id love to see that.

@MoeStooge 's setup is blessed with not having to worry about erpm. Considering the rate he was accelerating when he hit 57mph he had all the power and gearing he need to smash the record as well. From my vantage point on the radar gun, he would have beat the record if he had stayed on the throttle for 1-2 seconds longer. We'll have a new record soon Im sure.

what was happening where you were skidding?!  that sounds insanely dangerous and luckily it didn't throw you off with that insanely long skid mark.  or do I have it wrong and you just happened to hit that line in the dirt and it gave you a wobble?  maybe practicing in the dirt is the safest.  I couldn't see up the road at all though

I was having an intermittent problem with the esc on deceleration with the throttle @ neutral position. It would act like the motor would loose sync with the esc for a micro second and chatter.  Could duplicate on the bench and would see a corresponding spike in the data log. Could not duplicate if I unplugged both esc and calibrated controller before each run after that incident. Gonna try reprogramming on a different laptop but my expectations are lower than hopeful.

I thought for a minute you meant if you recalibrated (what do you mean by that?) then the problem went away but I guess not.  maybe you could send a big brick to 60mph first to make sure.  Is the record still 60mph?

I'm inclined to think what @Cobber was saying.  With most of my weight on the front foot and the air pushing back, I suspect I have found where the lake bed starts losing forward bite.  Maby aero or static down force  would have helped...

Having ridden your board do you think bushings would help. Bushings to have resistance so you can do a much lower tuck and keep all the weight on the front truck.

Was thinking about an anhedral wing with vertical Stabilizers soon after the run.  The dirt definitely has grip disadvantages but the open area makes it worth trying again. A rear foil would be my first choice before adding static weight to the rear. V3 will be an off road board front and rear Swing arm coil over 3-link on tillers 6shooters.  Most likely be a small Inrunner quad drive.

Moe has shared enough pictures already so...
Toro Beast 200a

it goes right out of sync. +12500rpm at "0"
the throttle also looks choppy

the other esc is only ~7000rpm odd at nearly 60mph...
that extrapolates out to Moe gearing the board for well over 100mph so I think it has to be some kind of fault. Rx circuit brown out is my first guess. I'd try a cap bank.

The 7th doesn't sag much more than the first, although the charge voltage has dropped. Suggests you are using more than they can give in my opinion and you have hit the ampacity floor.
Might need to go 2 or even 3p bro, if you keep whacking them with WOT and it sags down to low 3.?v a cell... (over 1 volt a cell sag) they won't last very long before they start dropping in full charge voltage, then they sag more... then...
plus you are robbing about 20% of your topend. 

So much more speed to be had from your current RBII, once your knee is better bro you will be steezing it up at +60mph :sunglasses:

Ok I know this thread is more about talking about performance than racing now so I thought I would suggest maybe we organise getting together and holding a racing series.  Hopefully some of the bigger builders will come on board and help with this. But i can see this being a good thing for developement of boards and having the win on sunday selll on monday sales , that car manufacturers use to do. 

I think we maybe just make it a limited class of max 3 KW motor and a limit on number of cells and cell type. 
 This way use the consumer will be better more robust devices and the sellers get sales .

I'm not a big fan of spec racing. When the rule book is vague and tech inspection is non existent It leaves out innovations and opens the doors for innovative cheaters. The hype is cheesy, but there will be a decent turn out and also some talented individuals jockeying powered lean tilt steer devices at speed, battling for the podium.  Not for everyone but to the guys riding in this it's a race.

If you ride a skateboard, yeah you're a skater! exactly..I agree..but I just think that events for only one brand of complete skateboard is a transparent marketing commercial..I like the idea of spec racing though..should just be all inclusive..to all skaters, not just the ones who bought a evolve or bought a whatever..maybe they should have like 30 charged boards there and invite rad skaters we all wanna see race go head to head on matching boards.. existing pro skaters winning downhills, ultra-skates and even freestyle...that would be worth watching..get some famous old skaters to race spec boards..

It's never safe to go fast. For a start it's not if you fail it's about being prepared for when it does fail. Mitigating hazards: Heat is the enemy. Any time your pushing the limits of electronics your exponentially speeding up the clock for component failure. In electronic equipment there is no Bullet Proof. Midigate equipment hazards by overbuilding your delivery system. I like to use the 65% zone as a safety factor. Just pulled data from my 2mile uphill pass at Tepe's & Tacos DH event on a 40mph setup. 128deg f on the ESC was as hot as it got. Also motors need the same Safety Factor, heat IS the killer. The more watts your motor is capable of handling the cooler it will run. Every board running 40mph should have 8kwatts available. Do you need it to go 40, No, but the failure factor goes way down.  Mechanical setup: sketchy and fast isn't a good combo. Plenty of bad equipment out there that has no business going over 25mph. "Guys! Heads up. Your high horsepower Speed Trampa builds don't work!"   SPEND THE MONEY.. buy precision trucks with proper angles and put them on boards that don't tortionally twist. Speed wobbles come from the rear.. I am building new board for breaking the world record and have deceided to test a front drive setup. The rear setup is the key to making stability at speed. By taking the drive off the rear it takes that dynamic out of the equation on the rear axel. Will be testing this theory soon enough..

Thats a good idea, and i kinda figured thats where the wobble came from... I tightened my rear trucks and use the front for steering now (granted i can't take hard corners w/o forcing a power slide) and im running a board that the calculator says has a loaded speed of 30 mph but i havent gotten close to tht at all im using a single drive (dented my can on my other motor) TB setup, 218mm trucks and all.... I have my own setup that I'm trying to get machined but I can't afford it at all it's a full suspension board w/ 8" pneumatic tires 4x4 hub motors... It's only in paper rn but as soon as I find a machinist that's willing to make them affordably so I can test them I want to start selling them

I'm with you on the front wheel drive brother! Skateboards are more stable with your weight over the front wheels. Breaking then becomes the issue where you need to shift your weight back?

I have been running my front trucks wider than my rear of late and I like it (gravity). The rear is still stable from the low angle but then turns in better when I want it to. 10mm seems to be enough to give the board the right feeling.

Can't wait to see what you come up with next :star_struck: :checkered_flag:

Taco's are bitchin..  this is my first DH/ freeride event. The promotors and skaters are warming to the idea of an esk8 on the hill. The raceboard has exceeded my expectations  with a 6min run on video uphill on a 3.5mile  course I've never seen. Promotor said 6min is a mid pack DH time..  Got Video of the DH on the raceboard. Brakes worked flawless and coupled with the grip, was able to over take and pass skaters on the way down..time again was about 6min..  used just over 1v of battery going up and down the hill in my 38000mah 8s pack on a 40mph setup. Stoked to be here doing this..   Making another run at the hill this morning.  ![IMG_20180401_080550100|690x388](upload://qhZj4jyj6BcFjdd0CMAxZudiCDB.jpg)

Amp max set low at 160a per esc. Punch control at 70%.   The motors and esc's are not having to work very hard. That is what you want to see.  Power wise it is lacking no where. I feel I could gear this thing at 50mph for the hill and still not build heat on either the esc or motor..

A special thanks to promoter Kevin Reimer for giving us the green flag on this.  If there is any doubts an Esk8 can't do this I hope this changes some minds.

Got to hang out with a guy named hippie Steve and his two buddies from Back East there on a West Coast winter skate sabbatical. He got on the race board and pinned it at 40 mile an hour no problem but not on the course. I kept wondering to myself where in the hell have I seen this guy before, then it hit me.

I noticed in the video there looked to be a new vertical linkage on the rear axle?... Maybe I only just noticed it?
Raising the axle connection reduced the angle of the rear 2/3 links, was this new for the DH?
Is that a removable/tune-able part of your raceboard kit?

Verticle link attached the rear axle to the CBR 1000 stabilizer. Raising the radius rod angle on the board side increases the steering ratio, much like changing RKP angles in the base plate..  I had the rear angle set at about 20deg rear steer.

On the rear because of the frame step up to accommodate the dampener. It allows the radius rod pick-up point to be placed on top of the axle. I think that's what you were saying?

Rod above or below the axle works the same. The attaching angle to the frame deceides the steer/ tilt ratio.   On the Tepe video I was had it set about 20deg running upwards to the chassis from the axel.

So less angle on the connecting rods = less steer correct?

Does distance from center pivot to the linkage point have any effect? Ie I see you have the connecting rods close to the end of the truck, vs toward the middle/center. 

Correct me also if I am wrong, but this 3 link system has no truck slop? I don't imagine it does based off the design and ball pivots being basically slop free.

The main Problem is that most eboard, using a vesc, could Output more power than it does!
The vesc is so popular because it is costumizable and has a smooth acceleration/brake.

Well, if the People would decrease the pwm Limits they will gain a lot of power! go from 2 to 1.8 and feel the difference in acceleration!

Vesc is a great tool.  I have a couple of FOC Boxes collecting dust for a cruiser project I would like to incorporate @hummies on my NKP 3-link. Would I use them for sustained 200a hill hammering at 30mph. I dont think it would last very long.

On my R2 i do not Need 200A. You mean uphill? I dont even Need 50A per VESC for 35mph.

Edit: your apporach is completly different. lower voltage, higher amperage, higher reduction. i just want to share the Information, that the algorithm of the vesc smoothes everything out thus it is not made for racing with the normal settings

I'm not sure the Raptor 2 can break 30 miles an hour on flat level ground, maby tweaked some. On this hill pull I hit just under a hundred amps peak on each ESC avg speed was 32mph 128deg F was the esc temp motors were cool to the touch at the top of the hill.  
The vesc isn't there yet. I hear claims of a super vesc in the works in the rumor mill. I'm hopeful of that.  https://youtu.be/R0Y0-aL2cmU

I'm just going to lightly chime in.. because it really means nothing.

But at 50battery amps per ESC on 13S, so around 4600-5400watts total) Ican sustain 29-31mph up 16-20% varying grade hill for about 3 miles, then it starts thermal throttling. But I'm also only 130lbs...

Not sure how long your runs are. Or your weight... But I'd likely agree with you if we're talking focbox without external cooling. A couple factors I think that play into this is High P groups or a battery with high enough discharge/low enough IR that the sag is kept to a minimum. So that the amps don't skyrocket from voltage sag...as well as the already high voltage, keeping the current lower. 

3.8 miles is the longest DH run I know of around here...and I can only make it up just over 3 before my speed starts to get limited to around 23~mph from thermal... I've been considering adding exposed sinks so that I never run into thermal throttling..even though it is already a rare case for me..

Your setup is drastically different however... Especially your KV range. So it is unfamiliar territory for me to comment on...

The simplest solution is usually the best. And to me, that's 4wd instead of 2wd if heat is an issue. Getting a big heat sink exposed seems problematic to me. More can go wrong there then just adding 2 motor esc's and motors.

Not sure how more can go wrong... 

I'm going to cut rectangles into the enclosure. Then mount a thin alu plate inside and seal it. Then screw these in from the inside(sink below outside) to pull the  the focbox mounting plate and the sink together to clamp the enclosure and hold the gasket sealed.

![s-l400 (3)|365x400](upload://a5GEiiUlqjkzHASzsdYDd5GBViN.jpg)![s-l400 (2)|400x329](upload://fCh5pcNe8btgABmymij7QFhL0Du.jpg)

Focboxes are at the very back of my enclosure and these sinks aren't lower then the motors and would only be a couple inches before the motors..so likely won't strike for my riding style. I avoid curbs, humps ect...

Overclock? If your keeping it cool and it's operating within specs of the fets. I don't see how it's overclocking..as the stmf4 still runs at 168mhz(iirc). The DRV switching frequency isn't changing.. nothing is changing. Your simply removing the heat to allow it to continue to operate at normal operating temps.. 

That's like switching cpu coolers... Not overclocking. üòë

Also more motors + focbox more money and not necessary. But that's my opinion...

ok, there's no point in arguing anything with you. I could poke holes in your statements too. I never said it is overclocking, just that it's like overclocking. Basically, your going to pump up the heat, like overclocking. No your not changing the clock frequency or anything. But I was using it to compare what your doing in terms of heat prodction. Then, your trying to pull that extra heat away with extra cooling. If you go 4wd, you solve that heat issue, you add more traction, and potentially, even more power than just adding a heatsink to 2wd. Then if it still over heats because your running way more watts now since you can in 4wd, you can add heatsinks for a beast of all beasts :P

I don't get why you think I'm trying to argue... But if you add thermal mass... Your effectively increasing the efficiency of the component.. because it can run cooler. 

Hot components have higher resistance. If you keep them cool and within the data sheets operating range. I'm failing to see how increasing thermal efficiency is like what your talking about.. 

I never over heat, in the 900ish miles I put in the board it's only twice that I've gone up that run as fast as the board would take me...

For me with the risks involved with speed. It is always a better setup to not hit working limits on electronics. If the potential used doesn't go over 65% of what, from the batteries TO the motors are capable of I believe a safety factor then is purposely built into the equation. An extra 700 to increase my chances of not hitting face to street at 40mph I think is a worth while investment.  Heat sinks is also a doing the right thing. Someday electronic delivery systems won't be a second thought. Till then we work with what we have and try to not make magic smoke.

The thing is @Deckoz & @evoheyax once you start producing the wattage MoeBro is, batteries and weight become your problem and to a large degree I think that's why Moe is where he is at.
You will need 4x 6.4 based controllers to get where MoeBro is (or 6 x 4.12...).
And any 4 vesc/motors/drive system that can use 75a a piece will be heavier than Moe's 2x...
Then think about a battery that can deliver 300a :exploding_head:
12s15p 30q? I don't think so...

With that said if either of you build one I'm sure MoeBro will welcome the competition :hugs: 
I Personally can't wait for you (evo) to get your 4wd hummie hub board dialed in although I can't help but feel in a head to head power challenge Moe's RBII will leave you wanting :thinking: 

@MoeStooge one of the fighting robot guys has made a monster 6.4 based controller, tested at 16s 150a...
But (x2) 20kw is more than anyone will need without being strapped in IMHO :crazy_face:
& BV is building a 300a capable vesc, which is essentially just three 6.4 controllers in parallel so nothing new there really :neutral_face:

Yea I can see that... I just don't know if my mass requires that ammount of wattage for maintaining 30mph uphill on my evo... At this point I was just saying to myself.

edit: I think there is a reason 30mph/50kmh comes up often, on a track bicycle in a velodrome 50kph is the speed where half your energy goes in to breaking air resistance. Past 50 you progressively need more and more watts to go faster, or put equipment under more and more stress.

My 16s Battery will only be like 7.5kw.  Which is overkill all over the place for eskate.

The controller is going on a 6kw Tangent Mid drive on a Downhill Bike Frame, haven't decided on the frame yet.  Tangent Dave said he runs his at 8kw on 12s.  That's V1 of his drive while v2 has better cooling.  300A peak with the current one is more than enough on 16s.  On a under 50lb bike its already like a dirtbike with a roughly 65mph top speed and crazy torque.

Heatsinks are great. 37+mph, want to go faster, but need more aggressive gearing or 12s, but rarely go above 50C. Might have to zoom in to read all the stats:

![20180421_175555|690x388](upload://g49o6ZDtJpWtGcB8uWVpPkbq7T2.jpg)

[These are the sinks I used](https://www.digikey.com/products/en?WT.z_se_ps=1&keywords=ATS1508-ND), each one fits a focbox perfectly width wise, and there's a bit extra length for extra heat dissipation. Cutting rectangles for each worked great + thermal compound between focbox and heatsink and a press fit with some thick neoprene foam. And they have a pretty low profile. If you like, I can share the link to the wind scoop cover thing I made for them.

ah man this makes me so happy.

I think this was actually the world first effort to bring the 2 worlds together, esk8 and downhill. And honestly we couldn't ask for a better representation than you. Your set up, your approach and your effort are similar to that of IDF riders in a slightly different setting. Just wanted to thank you for that. This is something I wanted to do for sooo long. Sadly I don't have quite the money or set up to do it as well. My carvon set up (2,5) just doesn't quite hit the spot :slight_smile:.

So sad you are on the wrong continent. I would pick you up with our van and go event hopping with you. #bring MoeStooge to EU ! Just my 2 cents. Check for IDF races near you, with a week long free-ride and a race afterwards. https://internationaldownhillfederation.org/2017/idf-2018-racing-season/
So you can fully unleash your inner speed demon and your set up in a setting that allows that. If I could I would take you with us here :) http://www.transylvaniadownhill.com/TransylvaniaDownhillPasulVulcan.html


May by next year I can bring my gravity and esk8 set up to events and do similar stuff to yours. This is what I ment when I wrote 2 years ago, that I hope we can work together (esk8 and DH) instead of trying to separate !

Well done man, also how respectful you rode and waited for signaled overtakes, giving them room and time to get acquainted with you is beautiful riders etiquette. Just awesome man!

This is a more hypothetical kinda question prompt, but would it be worth it to implement our own modified firmware onto some of these car ESCs?

@MoeStooge's suggestion for me to look at the Mamba XL-X for one of my personal builds lead me to find out about its (relatively) decent adjustability and data logging. So the thought crossed my mind, can we get it to at least the same level of adjustability/controllability as a VESC?

Like the dream here would be to have a car ESC with @Ackmaniac's current/watt-mode instead of that Duty-cycle stuff.

Hey guys why does a shorter board go faster? My top speed on my 48" bamboo is 26 if I hold down my controller and that's where I plateau... but I switched to my 40" (maybe 42") and it hit 30mph no problem and still had some speed but I backed off cause it's dark and all I had on was my helmet and some shorts... same power train, motor, belt, etc... only difference is shorter board

Got me on this.  Say your peak voltage is 50 and you have used enough batt to drop volt to 49. That is a 2% drop in top speed. I swear racing is faster in the dark.üèÅüèÅ

Idk, but I clocked it on my phone and double checked it today before work, on my boat of a board it tops out at 26 consistently my short deck tops at 33 (topped it out omw to work) but if I stay at 33 it sags very quickly

Well I finally read through the whole thread and I must say it's been interesting seeing all this innovation and plans for the future. One day I will start putting down the big bucks to upgrade my board/gear and maybe even meet some of you, but until then I'll be watching from the sidelines and learning!

For this reason I believe sponsorship in this new sport will be required for it to be successful..

I would like to see riders for brands, just like in traditional skateboarding....no teams from companies with a bunch of employees or special projects and such, but normal everyday hard core good eskaters, supported and funded to go race...

So I finally separated this damn stator from the housing... I separated all the phase wires and now I just need to find a can w/mags since the can for this motor was dented and broke (why I took the stator off)

As to the whole reason why, I'm building my 12v delta/WYE switch I mentioned a while back. More 1 motor u would need 2 of the relays in parallel shown in the pic since they are only rated for 40A

Took the prototype STREET wheel on it's first  run.  19.6 watt hr per mile avg on a 56mph setup as per data logger. Will charge battery and see if Ah matches up tomorrow and retest. The other set is being tested by a reputable rider. Report is he picked up 5-8mph over the Race wheel and same range as the AT tires. Grip and ride quality better than AT.  70a STREET wheel is looks promising.

@Luke Belz #evolveworldcup2018 wild card race. FWD 12kw #stoogeraceboards  #nkp3link  set fastest lap and broke the track record. Won every race x5 getting to the finals out of 52 riders. Luke was running second in the Final and fell trying to over take the leader on the last turn of the race. First time he stepped on the board was yesterday. This guy is a "racer" and wears his heart on his sleeve. Thanks, @karol_tru  for the great pics. #111ink  graphics

"Fast as F@#$" @morgan20justin on #stoogeraceboards 1rst generation. Dominated heat races, made transfer from the quarter finals to the semifinals. Rode hard all day and got the most out of his equipment. A pleasure watching a rider at this level  race againsed with the best in the world. Hope to work more with this guy in the future, a real class act talent. #evolveworldcup2018 #riptidesports  bushings/ pic by @carlverbruggen

It was a hell of a race. Would of loved another one! Next year!

One thing I want you to notice is how accelerating hard out of corners, you can hear cogging. That's something that needs to be worked out as it neutralized my acceleration out of corners. Any idea what causes that? Derek had a similar issue on his big motor trampa, and I'm actually having the same issue with my ebike right now also, haha.

Yeah  it's not cogging, it's wheel chatter from breaking traction on the less loaded wheel.  Front wheel drive downside, but not a deal breaker.

Derek layed out the Second quick by .1 sec. qualifying time at SPD2 at I would say at 250lb+ on his quad Trampa running pnumatics. He literally took a new set of tires an ran em to cords by the end of the day eventualy popping one. He was big and fast. ![IMG_20180107_080246|334x277](upload://sz7aOWVDgaBNg7eeiJRq32eRL1z.jpeg)  ![Screenshot_20171111-224801|281x500](upload://7To66MjjRtazjjk4hNYaKuD88yu.png)

Proposing a race format for #2 uphill. 
I believe this format will make for great racing. Keeping the rule book thin and allowing all performance levels to compete for a podium is essential to the success of the sport.
3 rounds of 6:
Every rider has a # 

Heat1) pill draw for heat 1 lines up the qualifying race.  6 person's per heat, heats numbered 1,2,3 ect. Radio at the top of the hill is the time keeper and starts the race. As competitors finish their time is logged with their race #.

Heat2) 6 person heats starting position and sorted by qualifying time.
Quick time Heat 1 P1. 
2nd quick Heat 2 P1. 
3rd quick Heat 3 P1.
4th quick Heat 1 P2.
5th quick Heat 2 P2.
6th quick Heat 3 P2. Ect.

Main events 6 riders.  
(A main) top 6 finishers from heats. Ties are sorted by qualifying times. Start positions sorted by qualifying times.

(B Main) 7-12 finishers from heats. Ties are sorted by qualifying times. Start positions sorted by qualifying times.

(C Main) 13-18 

All mains have a Podium.

Only issue I see is doing heats on an uphill. When I race I like to have a full battery, especially going up a hill. You'd have to wait a bit inbetween races for people to do a quick charge session, no use having races at 60% battery IMO. Basically to do the heats you'd have to plan a bunch of extra time in the day just so people could race in their prime.

The second heat don‚Äôt have a specific purpurs other than making an extra run right? It could be skipped If battery is an issue. 
It could be 1. Qualifying heats 2. Main events divided by time from the qualifying heats. 

This is a nice attempt to try to differentiate without making it to complicated. It‚Äôs still not perfect, but it‚Äôs a hard but to crack.

Can't speak for others. My run up 1.8 mile Barrett used 118 wattHr.  Maby a Quick pack lipo swap for those who don't want to charge between rounds. Or fast charge options. I don't see charging as being an issue.  It's a day's event with Downhill racing taking place between heats.  Most everyone had several practice runs before the race. Haven't heard any charge issues at the hill.

Second heat is purposeful and needed. If you start last in heat 2  from a bad qualifying time and win your heat, your in the A main with the fast guys but you would start P6 in the A main from your poor qualifying time. It sorts out high performance and low performance over two heats to make the Mains A,B and C fair and performance based.

[/quote]

mmm.... does this mean that you qualify to the main event from your placement in second heat - not the time? If so this means that there can not be more than two from each group in the A main? But you could potentially have the six fastest times in one group.

If we want to divide people as good as we can in performance classes I like that to be done by time alone and not placement. If we want to have a better base to sort from, do more qualifying heats.

In track and field they sort by placement first and then time but they don't have to  differentiate by performance classes. If performance classes were not a consideration I would do it by placement. 

In your example with one having a bad qualifying time and then winning heat 2 you will potential have one of the other fast guys in the main B instead of main A where that board belong. 

Anyway... your outline will work fine... these are just my two cents.

Racers are issued numbers and times recorded from heat 1a 1b.

Just got back from MaryHill rats DH in WA State. Been talking with people on UpHill Esk8 racing at these events. How do we take a diverse group of builds and riders, and give them an equal shot at podium with boards making different speeds on the hill.  Here is what we came up with.

1) Every entry runs a lone qualifying heat to establish a qualifying time on the hill. 
2) Main event start is staggered by slowest time leaving first. Next riders in line would then start from their qualifying time differences from the first riders start time. Quickest time up the hill would be last out of the gate corresponding to their qualifying time split from the slowest time that left first.
3) any rider that podiums and goes quicker than their qualifying time by more than 5 seconds is disqualified from the competition. (Aka eliminating sandbagging)

We have the Backside Brawl in May in SoCal to test this format.  I would like to cordially invite all boards with all skill levels of riders to attend. Everyone who enters has a shot at podium. No guts no glory.

@MoeStooge what do you think about a doing a limited class race in the future. I know you like the high amps of the mamba but I think we could really have some fun by doing a distance race with limitations. If we keep the top speed under 50 mph more people will be willing to pilot. If we bring range into play it will help keep us from reenacting the early days of "air race" too.

I'm down for anything racing.  Mamba can be dialed for any Max watt/speed output. 

Derby days. Fun time. 4.6mile sprint on a .8 mile course will have multiple classes.
https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/derby-days-race-redmond-wa-july-13/84409?u=moestooge

a mph Jig could be used for  post race "tech inspection" when we break into Max mph groups.  

Distance racing poses a new group of tests.  Would also be fun.   

I was initially encouraged by the turnout for Barrett.   Was disappointed with Bakersfield turnout but had a great time there as well.     

Did Mary-Hill last week to show Dean what we were capable of.   Maryhill UP-Hill is a go in August.     My fear is board count.  A 35mph uphill board is very obtainable.  Should we dial all boards back to this speed? I'm game if it keeps people coming back to the hill.  Speed will come eventually. Board count,  having a competition and fun need to be prominent.

That's pretty interesting. Sort of like bracket racing with cars but better since all classes are involved.

You could also do an IROC Champions-type race with mid-spec boards. Everyone brings a board that meets specs agreed on beforehand and you number and blind pick. So maybe you get to ride your own and maybe you don't.Then it's just rider vs rider for the most part.

Great to see people who might not think they have a chance to get to try racing. Just kind of hope it's in addition to and not a replacement for the purity of fastest to the top.

All of these places you and the community show look so incredible for skating... I'm stuck with grouchy people and 'bike Lanes'/ road shoulders smaller than caliber 2s are wide....

Can't wait to attend an event like this üò≠üò≠

Next Uphill race/freeride. it's my understanding the IDF will be timing the hill. Wonder if we can beat the downhill times going uphill. ![Screenshot_20190716-064711|281x500](upload://c8iaFr1h19FcoQaVaPBYGEArWdN.jpeg)

We had an absolute whale of a time in Paris, with Street and AT races. It was more of a chill weekend than a true competitive one (even though the prizes were good), with only a couple of true competitive teams (Trampa Boards and StreetWing).

We'll do this again next year and, even though we had a small US presence, it would be awesome to have more of you around here. I, for one, would like to see a Stooge board in the flesh! ;-)

Oh hey again, just replied to you on another thread haha.

I wish I could have made it. Colorado was fun but Paris looked much better organized and with more attendees. I can't wait to meet more internationals!

Paris is definitely on the table for 2020.
There is an uphill race in Denmark. SRB will be represented there with @davidbonde on deck.  Hope Europe can rally to the first ever uphill racing event. ![IMG_20190717_061940|423x500(upload://j54P1egEbOONdiPVfxcKUy5NGiO.jpeg)

If Paris next year is not right in the middel of my family vacation I will be there for sure. Unfortunately you guys in the south have your summer vacation later than us here in the north. So it might be a problem again :slight_smile:

 Definitely set a record. It is absolutely amazing to be able to get downhill speeds and times on an uphill board #stoogeraceboard.  I love this sport and can‚Äôt wait to do it again. Thank you Moe B Stooge for giving me the opportunity to smash Maryhill on your Stooge Race Board. 

That event was timed by International Downhill Federation (IDF) and to put in this uphill time into prospective.

The fastest luge time was 2:57:53 Ryan Farmer

The fastest DH open skate time was 3:01:03 Dane Hanna

The fastest Woman‚Äôs Skate was 3:03:82 Emily Poss

The fastest Masters Skate time was 3:05:68 Kyle Martin

I have an arrive and race situation available for a capable rider to race the Lancaster CA night races this weekend that will attract 30 to 35,000 spectators.  The ride is a Stooge raceboards build on a Red Ember deck.  You need to be comfortable at 50 mph to ride this board but race speeds are unknown till we try the track and conditions.

Update:  Looks like Tim Dell will be racing the board
