I know onloop/ernertion is getting flooded with requests of where is my ESC and why hasnt this shipped yet, and when will the shipment get here, and why are chinese food and chinese parts just so darned good..... So lets take some load off of him and just talk amongst ourselves. 

Who missed out on the first wave and is stoked as a son of a gun for the second wave??!?!? I know I have three on the way and with going through a bunk ESC from DIYES.... I am about as stoked as stoked can be to get back on the road!!!!

Gonna put one ESC onto the board that originally had the ESC from torqueboards and I am getting my first two motor build going. So sick of taking the bus to and from work!!! aaahhhh excited lol

I am taking the waiting time to read up on the VESC. Gonna program these things into the ground. There is a fair amount of room for play with these guys. Lights. Controllers. Readouts. 

We have other user(s?) working with solar even. Lots of room for inovation everywhere which is always great for building a community!

I think what he meant there (and its the 30th now so this makes sense) was that he wanted to do a sale for his carbon fiber boards but needs the VESCs to get those boards out the door. I did get an email about the carbon fiber boards going on sale too, so hopefully he has the VESCs in hand!! hahahaha

i've been wondering about this. originally they were set to ship November 18th according to the page i ordered from. I've got two on the way from down under for a complete i'm planning to list on my site. 

i didn't want to email asking for a status update because i knew everyone else has been asking, but what is the current status of delay? is there a current working ship date?

In his raptor build thread he mentioned the status of vesc as in final building stage... so not shipped yet. Think it was yesterday or something. Then he said his build progress for raptors is running a week late. So ... taking from that comment, we probably won't be seeing them this week.

I too have refrained from sending mails to Enertion asking for the status of my order, because I know its the VESCs holding it back.
Hopefully @onloop can post a short update re VESC's to this thread for us all.

Not sure if you're dealing with China our not, but I can say for certain I have never had a smooth transaction with Chinese businesses..kings of the classic bait and switch.
They can do anything you want and deliver it next week! Until you pay, then you're just a crazy round eye!

That's exactly the reason why I had a batch of VESC made here locally in Europe since I didn't want to deal with China for assembling and putting the right parts on the PCB's. 

And it takes less than 10 days to get them to produce the next batch. From the cost side it's a little bit higher, but at the end it's worth it.

I assemble them here in the shop so I have total control over production quality and materials. We also offer complete customization of the VESC. I have a compact dual VESC and a heatsinked version coming out soon too!

I would like to add that by purchasing from OllinBoardCo. You are getting a VESC made with the best materials available and supporting an actual builder/manufacturer as apposed to a distributor/middle man. 

Not knocking distributors, but sometimes trying to eek out profits leads to sub standard performance. The pricing @elkick has is a more realistic number to see from a distributor. If you also added the high performance PCB material used in my VESC's the price would be even higher.

The only reason I able to set my price so low and keep the quality so high is the fact that I am the manufacturer.

@chaka you just made my day with that dual vesc comment. One of the things i wanted to do with them was mount them both to a single, very shallow heatsink to bind them together, but it sounds like you're doing something similar. Keep us posted!

Stop lying to yourself man.... You are doing it the most expensive way possible, but your price is the lowest??

I know first hand how much time & effort you are putting in. I know you are passionate, But no one expects you to give your stuff away for free, so why do it?.. they'll happily take from you now, but they won't help you when you need it. 

If you want to survive you seriously need to do your business plan, I bet If you did the sums you are losing money on every VESC you sell...and making them by hand is very limited... there are only so many you can make in one day. Time is money. Your tools need power, right? what about tax? Do you have a normal job that pays you an hourly wage - what are you worth?

Also, try not to bash the outsourcing option too hard... because if you are serious player you'll be doing it too, soon.... so then how do you justify all those negative things you say about how the quality is no good if made in a factory? 

The guy from Bubblegum Boards made this exact mistake.... he didn't think about his time as a commodity, there is only one of you! there are only 24hours in a day. The first big mistake you make will be the last.

let's just hope you don't follow in the footsteps of BubbleGum Boards. **Bankruptcy..**

I have a stacked version with the same footprint as a single VESC measuring 1 inch in thickness. My personal favorite is the heatsinked single version with an aluminum base. It is what is going in all my integrated decks now. 

A side by side configuration will be coming soon but may require a modification to the gerber files to mount vertical usb ports like this one.

I have had to tell like.... hundreds of people who have wanted me to program for them this this very same thing. BBBUUUUTTTTTT one thing chaka does bring to the table is the (holy F im about to say this) "artisnal" feel. Being able to get my choice of connectors on the end and different space considerations, def cool. We always want our gadgets to do more and get smaller right?

There are two sides to this coin, and boy are they both business heavy. Its a hard part of business, weighing out all of those variables trying to make the best decision possible. Gotta do what is best for you and your customers to keep the company moving forward. 

I am happy to see you two compete though (Ollin and Enertion) as that means it keeps yall challenged and trying to provide the best products possible. I effen love this community. I love all of you.

If you want a custom vesc, made by specifically to your order (at the cost of a two week lead time) you buy one from @chaka

If you don't care about connectors, heatshrink, and any other extras, then you'll be just as happy with one of @onloop's vescs..

onloop said this batch is in the mail to him right now, and should get to him within the next few days. I would imagine you should get it well before Christmas, as it may take a week to process and test (just a guess, but seems reasonably possible), depending on how busy he is before shipping them out.

@longhairedboy was right that they have clear heat shrink on them. Looks like the VESC itself has clear heat shrink, and the capacitors have some blue heat shrink over them. Also these have an enertion sticker on them. I hope that I get one of those stickers to slap onto my board.....

I ordered mine in October (Order #1182) and didn't get an email yet, so I wouldn't rely on emails to determine who hes sending until he actually sends it. Did he send the email to you guys randomly or did you ask him when he was shipping it and he just replied to you? 

He said in a previous post that he ordered enough Vescs for everyone + extra although that was a few weeks ago so I'm not sure if hes surpassed the limit by now.

Yeah the email itself was in no way 100% sent by @onloop. While @onloop did put the email in place and get the email recipients set into place... the email itself was sent by mailchimp. So he wouldve had to get all of us included into mailchimp for all of us to get an email. 


I have worked with mailchimp a lot.... its a 100% bitch. So if you didnt get an email concerning the VESC... it simply means that @onloop was too busy to include your email into the distribution list. So you could still easily be getting a VESC (especially considering that @onloop claims hell never be out of stock again).

So I hope for the best for all of us, but for those of us with the emails in our inboxes... congrats!!! lol

If I were jason, and had to fill hundreds of orders, I wouldn't email everyone at once to tell them VESC's are going out.. it's a multi-day workload to add heat shrink and ship all these bad boys- just send out emails in order of when you are shipping vescs: plan to send 75 the first day, send 75 emails initial emails...

 by emailing 'hey, vescs have arrived' a week before they actually ship, you are going to get more questions than if you didn't send out an email in the first place.

@onloop put them together right and take the time needed to put out a quality product. The masses will thank you later.

I got an email that my order shipped a few weeks ago but he said he ran out of the color wheels i wanted so he printed the label but didn't send. i settled for yellow wheels and he said he would ship last week but tracking info hasn't been received by usps. I wanted white. Will ask again today. He said he was waiting on a wheel shipment from china but didnt know when they would come in and i said when they do to let me know because i really wanted black wheels and i would buy another set when they arrive. So maybe miscommunication. I hope he didnt think i wanted to wait for the wheel shipment.

Just wondering does anyone else still have the status "Awaiting Shipment"? Maybe the status/tracking is delayed?

mine says 'shipped', so i can only assume that any further delays in statuses are simply clerical. 

i wouldn't poke the bear. lol

Hey guys, I just received mine as well, does anyone know if these come preprogramed?  I thought I read somewhere on here that onloop set them up so they were plug n play.

Thanks

If they are preprogrammed it will be for one of the enertio. R-spec motors. If you have an r-spec then you mught just be ok. Otherwise.... get some linux action rolling and get the VESC connected to your computer lol im waiting for my laptop to arrive so i can do just this. All i have right now is my work laptop and they watch me on that lol

You will have to program them to use a PPM input (either wii nunchuk, or some 2.4ghz remote)

Check out the VESC faq section for step by step walk through's

Got mine set up and working with the nunchuck. Oh man it is fast lol. 12s with the big r-spec. I'm still building my deck so I'm just testing it on a regular park deck. Pulled a manual at 20mph lol. I'll have a build thread as soon as I finish my deck and housings. Thanks Onloop!!
