Ok, I really really really need a kicktail on my board.

I can't believe how restrictive the flat rear is on this longboard.
I have to get off the board, lift it up and turn around tight corners. 
It make me feel like such a dork. So:

Does a kickball longboard exist where its possible to use 100mm MBS wheels?
Preferably one that doesnt look like a duckbilled platypus.

Or will it inevitably mean wider trucks?

I have a few kicktails and I use 107mm wheels on everything (except a CarbonGT which has 100mm Constrictor wheels)

I just have doubts that 100mm MBS wheels are gonna fit without wheel bite.

Any board will fit them.  One of them is a Powell-Peralta Lance Mountain reissue which is  25cm (10") wide with no wheel cutouts and 107mm wheels.  Just use a 25mm riser and everything is fine

This one is great! That's how a skateboard should look like. Man this one makes me drift in nostalgia and reminds me of the times skaters where a bunch of people on public places practicing disorganized pleasure.
Coming over from the escape thread, i feel relieved.
Sorry for being off topic, but can you share a picture from under the board.

Best commuter board I've found.  A huge tail can certainly work with 107mm wheels...

I was just planning a build based on an old school deck.
Yours make me confident in pursuing this. Sadly over here the Powell Peralta deck's are more then 250$
I also have a diyeboard 10S5P battery lying around, which I don't use anymore cause of lacking quality. But the battery will come in handy for this build which I plan to use on rainy days where I have to hop on public transportation.

I need to fit a 10s4p Under here (laid out one cell thick). What are you running?

distance between trucks is max 25.3‚Äù / 64cm I use a 10s5p from http://diyeboard.com the rocker makes the clearance a little iffy to say the least BUT having a tail I've only scraped it the first time i used it - best of all this deck with a 10s5p still has good pop, skated for 37+ years and this is one of my fav. decks

Nice one! Looking forward to getting the new deck in the post. I do, however, see that your 10s5p is two layers thick... thats why it fits. My 10s4p is thin, flat. I dont think the enclosure I currently![IMG_0898|666x500](upload://6jCPD3RD3EW6r8pmBp3zzL4Pz0x.jpg) have is going to fit. I may have to chop  a piece from the middle of my original @bigben enclosure to make it fit, then try to join the two halves with fiberglass. I'll also have to try to move BMS on top of battery to get the space I'll need. I'll know better when I have the deck. I think it'll be worth it to get away from this cheap Osprey deck and onto the Lush with a kicktail.

Yeah personally use a short deck with kicktail but also have a lipo brick based battery so height of it is more of an issue than length.  If you're going with shorter board need to likely stack the cells.

Yeah, I've made a cruiser board too. Its just waiting for the enclosure. Its 30 inches but its my old Lush 42 that I have cut to size. It's gonna be great!

Its only 10s2p though. Im hoping I can keep the 10s4p from my current board and make it fit on the new Lush Machine 3D thats in the post. ![IMG_0902|666x500](upload://bB7XEl2TXcidypSwuWSthqtb9V.jpg)

Ok, sorry but I have to jump in here...what's this hogwash about kicktail decks only being under 30inches? No No No!!! in fact most pool and park decks will be over 30 inches, 31-33 is quite normal...BUT!! for electric skating we need longer wheelbases, more room for our batteries and because we typically use rkp trucks like we should for stability, we need a 20" or larger wheels base...enter the hybrid skateboard, or the "Skate everything" designs which are cross overs and include the best features of both old school skateboarding, and all the technology from longboarding and downhill. These decks will smash a skatepark, bomb a hill, ollie, kickflip and go over 50mph with ease...they truly are a "skate everything" deck but they suffer from being good at everything, and excelling at nothing.. 

These are the future, these decks can truly do everything and harbor traits and features from decades of skateboarding tradition. they all differ a lot, featuring many silly unneeded features because they are mostly used in freeriding and downhill. I have several of these decks and I've played with truck and wheel combos to make them do different things. what we need is skaters themselves to rise to the occasion of riding these and stop being so narrow minded about what type of skater you are and embrace all type of skating and learn to ride one board doing all styles. It's only appropriate that the eskates of the future be based on the pinnacle of non-powered skateboards...these decks have never truly shown off what they can do because riders have not learned to take advantage of them yet...and adding a motor will make that challenge even harder, but who cares...these are the future of skateboarding..might as well get some and start learning now...these are the deck I have been focusing my builds around and I they work great!

The only thing I don't like is the W cocave which is uncomfortable, so we use this for party nights in the city chasing the critical mass bikers or doing bar hopping..You can manual the hell out of this down the street, the kicktail is completely functional and fun.

This is my skater build, made to attempt the skatepark with smaller wheels (76mm) and the deck is the Jet super slider, which has a deep concave and a big nose which shortens the wheelbase a little over the other option, but it still works well with 44 degree calibers..

Kicktails definitely make sense for eboards. Gives you the stability of longboards at high speed and the maneuverability of a skateboard at low speeds. I'll add this as it's been my favorite kicktail ever and it weighs half as much as it should.

More than enough room to fit a 12s4p flat pack.

My current esk8 has a kicktail but I never used it, I don't know why, it's like my brain is stuck in electric mode. Even in dangerous situations when braking with the kicktail would have been way safer. I need to train myself to use it.
I used to ride a skateboard, so I know kicktails and how to use them. But not on my esk8 :thinking:

Well, I've finished my 10s2p 30 inch cruiser (with kicktail).

Im gonna have to run the vesc settings past a few folks on here because I'll need to set it up in a different way to my 10s4p... I presume, as amps will be less.

I LOVE this setup and size, although its kinda twitchy and the smaller board will take a little getting used to. I went for black and red theme!![IMG_0919|375x500](upload://kuWkSD3q3YMIgtkuAuglV7AzeGx.jpg) I like it a lot.

To reply to  (@egzplicit), the deck is an old Lush deck. I cant remember the name. It was 42 inches and I cut it to 30 while trying to give it some kinda nose. It was really flexible at 42 but at 30 is has a rigid DIY 18650 battery 10s2p 25Rs and almost no flex. 

The enclosures are @bigben 's work. I'll have to measure the wheelbase and measure the enclosure tomorrow but I know I ordered it slightly too big. Thats kinda irrelevent because its a DIY length deck anyway.

My other deck is a cheap Osprey (Blue) thats rigid and has no tail. Its 10s4p 30Qs. Both have 6473 single drive motors. The bigger deck has 15T 42T for torque and 90mm wheels

The smaller has 15T 36T with 83mm wheels.

I can max out around 25 mph (40 kph) on 14.5" - 15.5" wheelbase with TKP

I hope to achieve similar results. I'll be gearing with 32/11 on 76 mm flywheels. Maybe a bit slower like 35km/hr? Too lazy to check the math right now.

After looking at this amazing picture on reddit, I think I'm going with a Rayne Darkside 34" as my light commute board, it looks amazing with trucks and wheels mounted.

20mph (32kph) to 22mph (35kph) is a better top speed.  I can go a tad higher but I prefer 20-22.  Over 25 or so (40kph) is too much and I need a longboard.  If I even want to go that fast.

Just a heads up that Im selling this gorgeous Lush 3D Machine X-Tuff deck with kicktail. I can't make it work with my current enclosure and 10s4P laid out flat. Its just not worth me redoing the entire battery and sourcing a new enclosure. Shame! This would make an excellent Meepo upgrade:

I have a very difficult time riding a deck without a kicktail. The one exception is my jet spud and that has freeboard bindings. As much as I love my longer kicktail boards, I find myself riding the short jet spud most often...just love carving on that short wheelbase.![image|666x500](upload://fUUQruMuuSDGVoJo8dpBj4V57MQ.jpeg)![image|666x500](upload://i7IQDoiVw9SoVer45SXgurf2uJF.jpeg)

my meepo lasted < 24 hours before I swapped it :) really usable with 90mms 
![image|230x500](upload://tUOcmfgwAmI3A3av02Y5E4IlgXM.jpg)

ended up like this: 10s2p and v1 china esc. and unsensored 70mm hubs

![image|292x462](upload://287jM07Zm0iPuOGZcghSjaliML8.jpg)

terrible as a eSk8 it can't even handle the surface in the pics (lack of thane), but on smooth surfaces it feels just like a real board. Powered ollies are much more enjoyable than on 90mm :smile:

I'm waiting on an old space cell 10s3p. I have a couple of 6355s set up on calibers with enertion clone mounts.
Might use these or I have some 6374s which I may use as a single.
It'll be tight but should squeeze in.

So the nice thing about the space cell 3 is the battery doesn't fill the enclosure length, pop that foam out and now you have room in the front for whatever, especially another vesc for dual diagonal

Here is the beginning of my beauty thanks to all you fine folks. I've been doing my research and learning a lot from reading here. Pulled the trigger on the deck based on some of your posts, and then went with the 10s5p dual belt from DIYEboard because its fast, long range and it fits the wheelbase of my childhood Powell Peralta deck that I wanted to use. 

I'll post more when the kit arrives from China and I install it on the board. 

Thanks everyone!![20180804_235105|374x500](upload://7ciqpdBAUwq1mByU2dzdp6qR3J6.jpg)
