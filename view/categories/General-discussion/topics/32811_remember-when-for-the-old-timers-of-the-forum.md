remember when you only option for a hub motor was between a modified outrunner jammed onto a truck (carvon v2.5 and lower), a tiny motor that gets too hot (hummies first motors), a big motor with big wheel slipping problems (jaccobs), and the crap the came from china factories direct to customers that was never meaningfully tested and is garbage?

@GrecoMan @willpark16 He was banned from the forum for consistently spamming threads with a single argument that, while possibly technically accurate, was of only marginal value to the community. I personally had long dialogs with him encouraging him to modify his communication style. He couldn't, and after getting regularly flagged, and lashing out at others, he was banned. All the  mods agreed on this decision, it wasn't just one mod making the choice.
