Back in April I sent them some enquiries for modifying some of their existing gears. Turns out they don't entertain individuals. I'm not in the UK, maybe if you're in the UK you'll have a better chance.

We use the gearboxes to move vehicle mounted satellite dishes for broadcasting.  Basically we put a pinion gear on the gearbox an that rotates around a large rack to move the dish.  Hard to explain in words.

Their gearboxes are solid, the pinion gear wears after about 10 years and the gearbox's show no play.  Amazing really when you consider the weight on them.
