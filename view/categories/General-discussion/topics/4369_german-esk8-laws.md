The law here says that any self powered vehicle isn't allowed to do more than (i guess) 4 km/h. Its ok if you ride an e-bike and have to push at least a little.

To be legally correct  a board that exceeds the km/h limit have to be equipped with front&rearlights, a break, a horn/bell, and an licence plate...

They are considered to be cars legally - so you would need a license plate and whats called a vehicle type approval (you would need lights, a seat, steering, two independent brakes and more to get one). Anything faster than 6km/h needs this in Germany. With bikes there is an exception because they only support your peddaling and don't have a throttle.

When an accident happens you basically driving aan uninsured car and are personally liable for all damages plus the fines for riding an unapproved car in the first place. But on the other hand I have never heard of the police being overly strict - most policemen are apparently intrigued and find the board fascinating.

just read [this thread](http://www.elektro-skateboard.de/forum/szene-talk-63/rechtliche-auseinandersetzung-1396.php) from a German eskate forum. They are probably openly sold because the low numbers have not yet gotten the attention from the authorities. Just like segways there will probably be an exception in the future when the numbers increase - but right now we are riding illegally.

It's a bit tricky. There is no statement of the german government that refers directly to eboards if I am right.
But see this:

 I didn't check if all the information given in the link is correct but maybe it is a starting point :slight_smile:

thanks mate...unbelievable what i am reading there: " so ist die Strafe Freiheitsstrafe bis zu sechs Monaten oder Geldstrafe bis zu einhundertachtzig Tagessätzen"

"Weitere Sanktionen können sein:
• Verkehrszentralregister mit 6 Punkten geahndet. • Zusätzlich kann die Fahrerlaubnis entzogen werden." i had a good laugh at this.....losing my drivers license because of an Eboard accident :|

Honestly... That wouldn't be hard to do. I'm thinking about bringing my eboard to Germany next summer (obviously not the batteries, my friends there already have a few from other various projects that will work) and it wouldn't be hard to put all of that on it. Front and back facing lights on the trucks, horn would be a one-button program with the speaker I'm planning on attaching o the bottom of the board, and I could easily fashion a plate for the back part of the board with 2 screws and a piece of metal

You also need a seat, steering and two independent brakes - you would have to tranform it into a motorcycle and then have the TÜV actually make a full on investigation whether everything is actually correctly made (trust me: your skateboard will never be officially allowed on German streets with the current laws in place)

No idea - probably because nobody noticed as the number of riders in Germany is still super small. I basically have never seen another rider besides me. Also they could just argue that it is intended for sports use or only on private ground.

I doubt that anyone will give you a hard time if u have an esk8 in Germany. First off, the entire country is a hotspot for engineering innovations, so people will probably encourage it. Second, esk8ts are generally not very loud, so you aren't disturbing the public. Third, I had someone in my family translate that german law which supposedly limits everything with electric skateboards, and what was said isn't entirely true. The real limitations are:
45 Km/hr (About 27 mph)
Wheel Diameter of 400 mm

Now I wonder...if you did get in trouble...would you be considered a motorist or a skateboarder?

Old laws from old generations.  Just about a year ago, you could not use a Skateboard in Montreal Canada.  Being caught riding one got you a 60$ violation.  In Mai 2015 that all changed when the city adopted a new law letting skateboarders practice their sports in parks and on bike path. 

What I'm saying is simply that laws are meant to be changed, else there would be no progress.  Don't let that stop you germany.  Between all of us, better to ride an eSK8 then a petrol guzzler ;).  It is cleaner and more fun.

My two cents:
I live in Berlin, Germany. I see a lot of longboards and some on the streets but i have not seen one eskate yet. Waiting since a month for my raptor and as soon as its here Ill hop on and do videos. Lets see how it will be experienced. Hopefully I and other drivers will stay safe, since there is as you guys stated, no legal way of driving on public roads or sidewalks.
Really looking forward to it. 
Lets hope we dont lose our drivers license and or get the board taken away from us...
Its just too good to be taken away or miss out this new experience

I doubt you translated the correct law. Please post a link - it is in fact just like I stated above. Even a bike needs a license plate when it supports you electrically above 25km/h.

Also these laws are not meant to reduce noise but to keep the people safe. Having had an accident myself already I can say that esk8s are extremely dangerous and will only be allowed with additional safety features in place.

Yep - after the accident I got a helmet and ride much more carefully. Every car and every crossing is a potential hazard. It is our job to not get hurt even when they do the actual mistake. We will be the ones suffering. A driver in a car has so much metal around them to keep them safe - we do not.

when i researched it a bit in the internet i found to articles of people getting into trouble with the police for riding an esk8, one of them was a university student from munich whoms board got impounded and who lost his drivers license.
so as always if you met a dick of a police man you are fucked if he is a normal person he is probably only interessed

Lol what did the policemen say? Cant believe people have such miserable lives. I tend to be real nice especially with those that are very mad/hateful whatever you want to call it. No "fake" kindness, real from my heart. They must be real sad already.
I just had this situation today where this Ordnungsamt women which is something like a person to keep everything in order and give out nonsense tickets here in Berlin came up to my car and ticketed me for just standing in the second row. I did not block anyone and I ran to here as she wanted to start type it in here machine, told her politely that id move my car and she did not give a fuck, finished her ticket and printed it. I said well nevermind, have a nice day anyway and wanted to invite her to the coffeeshop I sat

He is registered on this forum too. If he wants to tell his opinion, thoughts he can write it down ;) Everybody would be glad to get more information but i do not really need more information.

E-SK8 in germany is bullshit. It is not allowed.... and if the cops have a bad day they will do something. Otherwise you are lucky and can just ride...

It is illegal because you drive more than 6 km/h, no insurance and the board is mostly not street admissible (2 separate brakes, reflectors, horn). When you will fix these points and go to the TÜV they may give you a certificate that you can ride it on the street. But this will be expensive!

right now, if the police catches you in germany, you could potentially be royally fucked! its why I sold my evolve and started building boards that barely give away that they are eboards. the few times police drove past me, I immediately started coasting and pretended to push. its the main reason why my single motor sits on the right side of the board and my batteries are slightly inserted into the board to make the profile as slim as possible! its also the reason why I sanded off the carbon on the board sides so it looks like natural wood longboard. :slight_smile:

think if they caught me, Id just be nice, act a little stupid and present them proudly the features like an enthusiastic supernerd inventor who never even thought about that this could actually be illegal. :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

That's the same thing as I do when I see the police, but if you are going 45 kp/h you don't have a chance to push.
Anyway I expect contact with the police in long terms and hope that they have a good day when they catch me.
Seeing the police while riding makes me feel like a 13 year old who nearly gets caught smoking behind the school :slight_smile:

I'm thinking about making an ultra-portable penny e-skate and bringing it to Germany when I go next summer. Got a ticket last summer for going 5 km/hr over the speed limit. Why are they so strict with car laws? They told me that in order to pay it, I would have to set up a bank account in Germany. I didn't do it, because that was rediculous. I love the country... But seriously? I don't think I'll get fined for riding an e-board. Even if I do, not too worried. I've been there once since the ticket, they seem to have dropped it :joy:

My love to eSkates got turned down a bit by the cops last week.
I got busted going uphill with 25 kph and no possibility to escape or hide.
Shit really hit the fan and these "special" cops have been real assholes in my case. In the beginning I tried to play it down, but no success at all. I got three different complaints and now the case is at my lawyer.
Since then I haven't used my eskate, because I didn't want to make things worse.
To be honest I don't think the eskate future in Germany is the brightest.....
The Segway people invested a shitload of money to get there vehicle street legal here. They had to limit it to 25 kph and every Segway needs a license plate. That is ridiculous!
It's on the big players like Evolve to make it legal over here.

Yes I agree!
I mentioned Evolve because they should be in a better position. I'm not sure if I invest money and a lot of time to get anything moved in the right direction. I think it is a fight where you can't win.
E-Skateboards are illegal in Germany, that's it and nothing will change in the next future.

I'm not sure for now.

I'm building a Trampa now to avoid the streets, but if you ask me the only real skateboarding is on tarmac :confused:
To be honest I don't care about the fine because its only money. Not that I have too much but loosing my drivers license would hurt much more.
I've spoken with my lawyer that I like to continue riding these beasts, so main goal is to keep my shirt white.

Even I knew it I haven't mentioned it.
Maybe it will help me in future who knows!?

After I started arguing they said: "We can confiscate your vehicle."
At this point I realized that they will not take it and I shut my mouth. They only took pictures.
I said to my lawyer that I can easily limit the board to six Kph in case I have to show it at the police. He said that it wouldn't help because the cops have seen me riding much faster.

EDIT: I got a drivers license so the third is something else.
All papers are at my lawyers so right know I can't check whats up.

Wow... This whole thing sounds rediculous. How could they try to take your board away when whole companies like mellow are fine?? I think I'll probably shoot an email to mellow and ask... They seem to be pretty open about what they do. And I hope that you win in your case, riding an esk8 should be a right.

I got a quick reply from Mellow!! Here's the email as written:


Hi Ben,

thanks for your mail and raising the concern! It´s actually not off topic at all, we are really concerned about this and we are closely looking what politics is up to.
First thinks first, the mellow drive is going to be sold as a sporting good like the other brands as well. This way we don´t need to fulfill StVo restrictions.
Also we need to tell everyone (like any other brand) the product is for private property use only.

In general the whole topic is located in an grey area. Parts of America such as California legalized electric skateboarding by the beginning of this year, Denmark and a couple other in Europe will follow. Already 8 major capitals in Europe planing on banning cars from the city centre as well as in the long future banning them from the whole city.
Politics will be forced to face up with new mobility solutions such as electric skateboards, who will be a perfect first- and last-mile solution. 
We are already sitting in a committee of the TÜV to help finding classification standards for electric skateboards, which means we take this topic very seriously and do our best to help finding the best solution.

Until then it really depends on the area and city your are living in, Berlin compared to Munich e.g. is way more open to this type of mobility and facing a punishment is less likely.
We hope the more people ride electric skateboards the faster we will have political decisions, Media Markt as on of the biggest german electrical appliance wholesalers is already selling the yuneec E-Go and therefore is not afraid of potential fine´s. Thats why we are less concerned and we are seeing companies like Evolve, Yuneec, Inboard etc. not as competitors but more like likeminded brands who will change the future of e-mobility.

Only concern though are the cheap copies from China (not saying there can´t be quality products from there) we are seeing right now. We are afraid of new consequences as we have seen with hoverboards. 

Long story short, the police can fine you if they want, but actually there is neither a law against it nor allows it. So let´s hope the more they see the more they will get used to ;).

Let me know if you got any more questions and feel free to add me on Skype to talk about it!

Stay mellow!

Tony

That's false if you are riding on the street!
Riding without insurance, without ABE and without license plate.

There are strict laws against e-skateboarding and the worst is that there is no difference riding a skateboard or driving a tank in the city.

Swiss newspaper article: 
http://www.20min.ch/schweiz/news/story/Busse-wegen-E-Skateboard---Politiker-fordert-Loesung-16079876 

In short: a Swiss student got fined in Zurich for riding his Yuneec e-go. Since there is no defined fine in the penalty catalogue for riding an e-skateboard, the case got reported and the student ended up paying around 620 CHF (around 620$). 260 CHF penalty plus 360 CHF administration fees. :-( 

Looks like we are in the same shitty boat as our northern neighbors (Germany). 

Summary: don't get caught!

Im not riding with paranoia, but Im observant, have met police more than 10 times now and always spotted them first, always coasted and gave it a few alibi pushes, thats it.

I think if anything, it would be smart to buy a controller than has an on/off switch for the second channel, and have that second channel limit the speed. That way if the cop asks to test it you can have that switch limit the speed to 6 km/h and nobody will know :laughing:

Yes I have an insurance for that. Make sure it covers traffic cases.
To now the prosecutor determined just in case of driving without insurance.
Bad enough, because the fine can be massive. Good for me that I haven't done anything traffic related crap my whole live.
Would be much worse in that case.
My lawyer try's to make a deal with the prosecutor, but it will be expensive for sure.
Worst is that I will never have the freedom of riding again.
The German laws suck so bad and don't expect anything to change within the next years.
The government is so ridiculous by planning 1.000.000 electric cars in 2020 in Germany that they don't care for a much more affordable solution.
The advice "don't get caught" is golden.

Instead of commuting all day you could look for a nice lonely spot like a large industrial area on sundays where you can take at least one ride a week. Of course riding there is also illegal but the chance of getting caught is by far smaller as in everyday commuting.

-	inviting all local and foreign supporters for a demonstration
-	plus all the big names making money from boards (evolve, boosted, etc.)
-	to hand over a petition to the related minister / officer / board
to let them handle the situation on EU / country level?

It would also help to have not only some references listed but related laws attached (e.g. from where it is already controlled and has adoptable rules).

I’m pretty sure fighting for it individually won’t solve this in short/mid-term.

Of course that's an option, but if you experienced the freedom of riding everywhere it's boring in a small area.
It was just epic to grab the board and have a nice ride to some friends and that was what made an e-skate so valuable for me.
Of course I love skating, but how long would it be funny to ride in an industrial area? Typically those areas are flat without hills and turns. 
My lawyer suggested me to go on a go-cart track and I might do that if I find somebody in my area to join. Maybe its fun but where is the point to go by car to a go-cart track to ride there when I could do it in front of my door with infinite road?

Anyway! Right know I'm just pissed and angry when I see all the e-skate stuff I bought, because I planned to extend this epic hobby. It's be far the best thing I had in the last couple of years and for now its on ice.
I hope that I can enjoy riding on the streets legal at some point, but for now I just want to save my own arse.
Right now I don't know if I will ride illegal in future, but when I decide against I have a lot of parts to sell :smiley:

@kovjanos
Sounds great and if someone sets something up I'll be there!

I'm curious about the people who make money with it as well. I mentioned earlier that it should be in there interest to make the product legal in the EU. Evolve and Boosted should have the financial background to do it, because that's all you need for a law. MONEY! The Segway is the greatest example of all time because they paid a shit load of money for a new vehicle category where the vehicle is called "Segway." 
Nice move because the marked is blocked for me too products. So in long-term you may get your money back if you have the exclusive right.
Time for the big players to create a monopoly and fuck the DIY community.

or keep on working on super stealth setups and only ride 20kph tops! i found that if you set up your board to be really turny, even 20kph can be fun with carving! :slight_smile:

I'm building a compact one with hubs right know to make it more stealthy. I have a set of Jacobs so they shouldn't be to fast. In my region aren't a lot of flat areas for carving and pumping. The motor especially the brake feature make the electric skateboard so valuable for me. Hills are a pain when you are on Flintstone mode.

That really sucks! Here in Portugal I think no one will bother me if they see me riding an electric longboard. A few weeks ago I passed by a motorcicle accident with several cops around. While I was riding in the bike lane only one looked at me just checking what it was that I was riding.

The polititians here have more important or not so important things to think about. No one will care about electric longboards if they can make a tax over it and for now there aren't that many electric longboards in Portugal. I only know about mine and saw one E-Go a few months ago.

You will never be able to constantly check your surroundings - so this was just a matter of time.

Hey...New to esk8 and longboarding in general.  Just ordered a evolve carbon gt 2 in 1.  Been reading through the thread...

  I'm a Canadian living in Hamburg and was hoping to use it to commute around the city, but reading here is making me think otherwise.  I bumped into a guy the other day in the city with the same board, but didn't have enough time to ask him about the legality of it.  
Perhaps this is my optimistic side thinking, but is there not some way to get this thing a TUV or at least get the ball rolling in the direction of making it a debatable issue?
I love Germany...but mega pissed about the contradiction of rules here....I know my fair share just getting a visa each year.

The worst word in any language is "can't".  We can find a way.

I know we're a small community (esk8ers), but there must be a way to start the topic of clean energy mobility.  Governments love showing off "green solutions".  Denmark and Finland already have something like this (if I understood correctly).  

A bike can ride the road without insurance.....even if we have to limit our speed ( only when their watching of course ;)

Even if you get an insurance, you're not allowed to ride because you need an operating licence for your "vehicle" because it's motor-driven, that's the problem.

Ask your Distributor, ask other big brands that sells boards in germany like Yunnec, Mellow etc. if they can help. It will take money and decades of years but laws will change and in the future our kids hopefully can ride eboards without fear of the police.

Government is focusing on cars, electric-cars and stuff, they give a shit about skaters.

Is there a esk8 association in Germany? I'm German living over here in France at the moment and it's quite interesting to see how associations are used here to create a voice, if you like to say so. It's good if there are lots of esk8ers around but as long as they are not organized there is no real weight to their voice. 

I'm not convinced that esk8ers should actually participate in road traffic, especially in cities and densely populated areas. I would wish that our infrastructure would make it possible for small electrical vehicles to commute through town already, but think there we still have a looong way to go.

Just my 2 ;) anyway, happy riding, stay safe and don't get caught!

Lets face it: we are a car-crazy society and our cities are dominated by cars and every law they make is pretty much to ensure that these big and bulky machines rule on forever and are not challenged. E-boards by themselves aren't a big savety issue, it's the cars and the people behind the wheel that kill. But dare to use precious public streets with your 20lbs monster, you are not welcome in between tons of steel only waiting to run you over. B/c you know it's their streets, made for them, owned by them.

It's a shame really. On the other hand I find it suicidial to ride your board in the thickest traffic in between lanes of moving cars. I will definitely stay on the bike roads as much as I can and not ride reckless. I live next to a leisure area and that's where I'm going to get my fun, not in the city.

I understand where you guys are coming from.  
But as someone else mentioned, we need to get organized.  
I'm a stubborn SOB and don't want to take this sitting down.  Obviously changing a law isn't something that's done over night (not without money at least).  I also don't want to ride constantly looking over my shoulder...although I will 😉. Just don't get caught isn't an answer. 

I will gladly make this my mission when I get back from my holidays in two weeks.  Since my German is scheisse, perhaps someone could give me a hand when the time comes with translation.  The mood in this forum is a little pessimistic (got understandable reason) regarding the rules changing anytime soon.   I don't want my kids to have fun...I WANT TO HAVE FUN! 😎

I will start contacting several of the dealers and distributors when I get back to see their interest in supporting this matter.  Mellow seemed to be quite positive about working with others from what I read here.   Evolve and others should be interested too as it would open the market for them giving them tenfold the market that us early adopters bring them.  

Best case scenario...we get things changed and are able to ride, even if it means some sort of insurance.
Worst case scenario, they ban it and deport me back to Canada.
I'm willing to take the chance

today I rode past a parked police car with 2 policemen inside - basically I couldnt see them for quite a while cause I rode directly into the sun and they parked in opposite direction, directly facing me ... so they had a LOT of time watching me.

lucky that i was in a really chilled mood, was carving really wide, but probably not faster than 20kph. I managed to nod at them friendly while coasting and passed without any trouble. :sweat_smile:

I've been riding for 2 years in Brussels and almost never had an issue (yuneec e-go then homebuilt 45+kmh). Drove past cops at 30kmh without issue but I try to limit myself to 25kmh max when I see them. In Belgium the law kind of says that you're allowed to use a electrical moving device vehicule type without plate or insurance as long as it doesn't go above 25kmh AND it doesn't have a throttle... Like a solowheel, an 'hoverboard', a segway, an assisted electric bike. If it goes only 6kmh but has a remote, throttle or something you need to be insured. 
I still have to look for the price of the insurance.

I have a helmet and drive safely, slowing down at intersection etc and I believe cops see me as a safe road user so don't bother. It might happen someday tho. 

The only time I have been stopped is literally the stupidest one. With a normal skateboard you're allowed on the sidewalk below max walking speed (like 5-6kmh), and then you have to be on the road like a bike if you go faster. The policeman didn't know that (he didn't realise as well that my skate was electric), I was literally with friends that were walking and going at the same speed as well and he still ordered me "no skate on sidewalk!". I obeyed for a hundred meters and that was it. Other than that I think people are a bit nicer here, they have other things to do than bother us. (fingers crossed)

So on a slightly positive note,  Mellow won with their pitch at the night of the start up in Berlin.  
That is a positive step in the right direction.  At least people and investors see e boarding as something to invest in. Now just have to convince the rule makers.

I will be visiting their office in the next week when they get back from Orlando expo.  50 of the visit is to talk to them about the rules, and the other 50% is to check out their ride.

Pretty cool that there´s a German brand with the same concept as the [Unlimited´s Eon](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/rideunlimited/eon-by-unlimited-plug-and-play-electric-skateboard/description), didn´t know them yet. :flushed: :flushed:

The more companies (especially from Europe) fight for the legalisation of esk8ing, the bigger the chance to get our boards street legal in forseeable time.

But 1.699 € is a pretty self-confident price compared to the Eon´s R-Kits (729 €) with twice the Wh, regardless if the Mellows are made in Germany or not.

Never heard of that Eon, thanks for sharing.  Nice to see all options available....cheaper or not.

Definitely the more companies are based here in Europe, the better the chances for legalization.  When people hear words like greener and jobs, governments eat it up.  

Really excited to go and try the Mellow boards.  I'm hoping they will let me take some pics or video to post online, but not holding my breath as I am sure they would like to control what comes out of their camp.  They did seem extremely friendly and welcoming at the emails I sent. We see.

I would try ackmaniac's software (cruise control). and watch your speed when you are near a road. I live near Stuttgart and have had the bad luck of only owning one esk8 that won't run for a mile at a time. I have the good luck that I seldom see polizei patrolling around here. 

 I figure if you don't ride agressively, avoid places where you know you'll see polizei, and watch your speed (again, I plan to use ackmaniac's app when I get a working esk8) you may be just fine.

Thanks for response.

I definitely not going to ride at top speed on central bikeways or anything like it. I want skateboard just to travel around the city and daily commute. I though about in-wheel motors board - they are less recognizable as electric.

Also I'm not from Germany and a bit confused regarding rules - can you help me with newbie question if you are aware? Please, read these questions as for traditional skateboard or bike (if rules are the same):

1. Should I ride bikeways and roads if there is no bikeway?
2. Should I wear a helmet?
3. Can I ride in parks?
3. Do I need special insurance? (I have common health insurance)

You can go 6km/h on the sidewalk just like with a normal skateboard.
As soon as you go above you might as well drive an unlicensed car without insurance (fun fact: even if you wanted to you can not get insurance for your skateboard).

I hate to be the buzzkill but you need to be aware that IF they want to they can get you in trouble.
How likely this actually is if you are riding carefully and not overly flashy depends on the location.
Berlin might be easier than Munich for example.

But still: You need to be aware that in Germany you can get into serious trouble (confiscation of the vehicle plus a 1500€ fine AFAIK)

Can you read German?
There is a lengthy discussion about this on the german esk8 forum with some hints as to what to say to police in case you get caught.

The german esk8 forum works pretty well with google translate :wink:. From what I gather on that forum, 6km/h on the sidewalk, and 24 or 25km/h (I can't remember) on the bike path is what you should aim for, because that is the limit for electric bicycles. While an esk8 isn't an e-bike, it could be argued that if you travel above those speeds then you need insurance/seatbelt/license plate/insurance. If you have the VESC set to only operate within those speed limits, then you should be fine. It's not like polizei are going to be able to get into BLDC tool and see that you can indeed go faster. Even if they see you looking at your phone, what are they going to do, confiscate your phone or make you prove you don't have bldc tool on there? I think if you have any street smarts at all, and aren't going way over the speed limit, you should be fine.

Polizei also aren't going to be able to tell what watt hours your battery is, they aren't going to be able to tell what size the motor(s) are or their output (what size your battery is) from looking at it. As long as the polizei don't see you drafting 50km/h up the street or acting like an ass and you are respectful, you will probably be alright, at least where I am in Stuttgart. I know e-bikes absolutely don't abide by the rules (on the bikepath at least), so I am not worried about being pulled over there (it runs through the woods).

Then again, I don't really want to get around the law so much as abide by it with whatever esk8 I end up with. If you want to disregard this speed limit on a bunch of city streets, then you will most likely get caught at some point and hemmed up by the polizei.

Problem is that when in doubt they are allowed to confiscate and have the vehicle checked by professionals.
They will find out about the watt hours and bldc settings and you will have to pay for this investigation (besides any fine it will impose) if they find anything - which they will. Good thing is probably that the number of riders is relatively low so the "idiot-threshold" has not been reached that will make them look out for us.

I have driven past the police before and have not been stopped - I immediately switch to pushing and hiding the remote when I notice them (hub motors help ;)) so it can all go well. The problem only starts when you have an accident or get caught. Accidents can get you in serious trouble as you might be liable for the damages and no incurance will cover them - especially when someone gets hurt this could be life changing for you.

Take away has to be: Be careful and don't get caught.

If I ride an electric skateboard that works within the confines of german law, it should not give the Police probably cause to investigate whether or not my board can go faster, as it probably can. Probably cause is all they need to confiscate the board. That is the same thing that keeps them from conducting a warrantless search on my person or my car or other personal property. This is at least what probably cause is in America, but I'm sure it's very similar in Germany.

I just want to ride a skateboard uphill at a moderate pace and have some type of brakes (other than the foot kind and/or hand pucks) riding downhill

I would not ride in the road here. I would stick to sidewalks and bike lanes. Always wear a helmet. Anywhere you get caught going above 6kmh by the popo you could be in trouble. There is no esk8 insurance, although if you have a segway, there is insurance for that.

Hey guys, thanks for replies. Such a responsible people in this thread.

I've looked through german forum. And it it almost made me cry. I'm really in doubt regarding buying eskate. I do not want to care about court, police and 1500 euros fines because I want to go from work to home with pleasure of this wonderful invention. It's just stupid. But I definitely don't want to buy bike - I tired of this bulky beast back in my country.

I'm so disappointed... Couldn't even imagine that it will be so complicated here with electric vehicles.

In Italy we have a vehicle category called "ciclomotori e quadricicli leggeri" (category AM) <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/2/1/21682519b3f4d057e3ba3ca331362e7608cd4b9d.jpg" width="584" height="391">.These have a tiny license plate <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/4/6/4653fbfd70ea9f32c4cf92527ac7719da1c80298.jpg" width="352" height="288">
I believe esk8s would be very easy to squeeze into such a category because it has these rules:

Minimum age: 14 years old
2/3 wheels vehicles: max50cc motor; max 45km/h

IF ELECTRIC: max 4kw power; max 45 km/h

...and brakes, turn signals, headlights/taillights, and a seatbelt, I think.

The problem with esk8 is that no insurance companies are willing to insure a skateboard, because it is incredibly easy to injure yourself, or someone else with it. I know there are a couple of insurance companies in the states which will insure long boards. It is kind of a catch 22 here though; esk8s aren't allowed to go over a certain speed because there is no insurance, and there is no insurance because those German companies aren't willing to take that risk. If the German law was more relaxed, i'm sure it would cause insurance companies to open up. If there was the possibility of insurance, the laws would change to support it. 

There will have to be a real boom in esk8 to make any of this change in Germany. There has to be $$$ for politicians to want to change their minds.

@fedestanco nice info you got there!

Yeh, if someone could 'explain' that it is a 'moped' without a seat and handlebars.. something like ''mobility device'' then I think it could be done (of course, if other regulations dont work against it)

Even the speed and power limit is somewhat okay I think :) Im sure it would be possible to limit the power to 4kw at least for dual version.

The German eskate laws are complete bullshit and there is no change in sight. You can only hope for a new EU lay, that Germany will probably fight/boycott but will hopefully give into many years from now. Mellow, Boosted etc. did a lot of PR/interviews stating that normally riding it was a "gray area", which was a plain lie. But more recently Mellow stated in an interview that they think their "endless ride mode" is legal:
http://www.spiegel.de/auto/fahrkultur/elektro-skateboard-mellow-die-perfekte-welle-a-1035522.html
Now this really IS a gray area. Because the law makes an exception for vehicles that:
- can't accelerate on their own above 6 km/h
- only assist you in manually increasing the speed
- stop assisting at 45 km/h
- do not exceed 200 W

I still live in Germany and thought about building one and setting it up in this way for a long time. But since I find these restrictions completely ridiculous (push assist is definitely more dangerous than the normal ride mode), and since I'm going to move to California at the end of this month I decided to f**k it and wait until I am in the US.

German Police just caught a fellow boarder again:

The slogan they mention is from the Mobo website - which is not really stealthy ;) so I can see why they might have stopped him. But it is still another bad day for eskaters in Germany :cry:

Edit: just checked and the Mobo only has one motor - they mention two 800W motors though. No idea what kind of board he was using then.

I was caught today with my evolve board. I am based in Berlin. I have been riging here for a while without any problems. I had a helmet on and I rode on the sidewalk. Slowly. I was kind to the policeman. They didn't ask much questions. just said they need to take it and give it to court to decide. Don't know what to expect. Board is quite powerful. 
Did anyone go throug the court decision here? What was the outcome? There is a lot of scary facts around, including police blogpost etc...

@Jamy When talking to police I told them I usually drive in the forest and they told me that even that is not legal :) 
They told me I can only drive it on my own property. Having said so according to what they said you might be in slight danger in Templehof also ;/ 
When I was buying my board I saw very little about police getting in involved. As I look now it seems police is more aware of esk8. Meaning they know what they are looking at.

Because cars are the biggest industry here and only if VW can make as much money from skateboards as it can do now with cars the politics would change.
In the german forum we just sent a letter to three members of parliament to help legalize esk8ing.

This is craaazyy. I live in Berlin as well and am getting pretty scared that they would confiscate my board as well if they saw me. I could even get points in my car licence's registry. 

I've read the article that @Jamy posted and i've gotta say it's not good news. It says it's completely illegal and also that it can not be registered, even if you attempted to do so.

I am usually proud to be german, but the car companies are massive cheaters that are failing to realise how crucial it is to commit to electric vehicles. Instead we are continuing to produce gasoline cars and we fail to legalise smaller electric transportation vehicles, that are so desperately needed to solve our world energy mobility crisis. 

Just had to get that out to you guys.

this is pretty much the only thing which needs to be removed and we would at least have a chance to get a "einzelabnahme" (no idea whats that in english) at the tüv in order to get insurance and a licenbs plate (would probably look funny  on a skatebaord XD)

everything else lights, reflectores, braking requirements, a bell, top speed limit ... can be done.

You should follow the law and adjust your settings of the VESC with a max speed of 6 km/h. This would make it legal because 6 km/h is allowed. And then when you ride on private property where nobody cares what you do you can use the app and unlock the VESC and have full power. And when you go back on the public road you only need to switch your board off and on again and it is automatically at 6 km/h max again because by changing the mode you don't change the default settings. That's a slow ride home but i think it is the only option to ride it legally in germany at the moment.

And if you are **SMART** you just simply accept my advice's and buy a bluetooth module and do it that way. Then they can take away the board from you but they will only find out that you use it in the limits. 
**Please don't discuss this advice any further.**

And if they ask me why i have the motors i tell them the truth. I just need them for braking. Because i am too scared and not skilled enough to brake with sliding. And the tiny little motors at least have enough power to  ride you home at a walking speed if you are tired which is a cool side effect. But they are too weak to push you any faster. So motor amps also need to be very low. 

Just be serious. How could these tiny little RC toy motors push a human body. But luckily they brake very well by shortening the motors.

Hi Guys,

Just a follow-up to my story here.
For those who don't remember, I was caught in Berlin riding my Evolve board. (more on that in this thread above). My board was confiscated and I had to wait until last week once Police decided to return the board from their HQ.
At the police station, I was notified that I will receive the decision from the court and that I will have to pay around 500 euro penalty.
So then, last Saturday court's letter came via mail. I have to pay 1200 euro. ;(
I will be trying to get penalty lowered by a lawyer.

I was hoping they would drop the case entirely, but as it turns out they treat it very seriously. They were definitely testing the board. I saw unusual chalk marks at the wheel as if they were testing the speed on some kind of track.

I will be selling the board to cover the costs. Otherwise, I can't afford the penalty. 
Perhaps someone wants to buy it? (Evolve Bamboo in great condition) If anyone here has any inexpensive traffic lawyer contact, please share

According to German law your board is probably car. Driving it in the bike lane is not gonna make it better. Look at @Ackmaniac's workaround and make your board technically not qualify as a motor vehicle...

I used to follow that rule exactly. Bike lanes whenever possible, be kind and considerate etc. They stopped me at the pedestrian crossing. I was riding super slowly. They came and knew exactly what this is and what will happen next. There was no room for negotiation. This would play out differently in other German cities I am sure.

Let us hope they will begin to look in the direction of your neighbor in the north. We have just voted for a law that makes e-skating (together with a hole group of electric vehicles) legal (temporarily with evaluation every year) from 1.118 on public roads. this is a huge step in a very regulated country like Denmark. I have been reading all the material that led to this legalization. They have been working quit thoroughly getting inspiration from all our neighbors including Germany. I hope the changes in Denmark will inspirer the rest of EU. 
Now we really have to handel this legalization with respect, and not fuck it up. We have to behave on the roads :)

Hi guys,
I wanted to give you an update on my situation. (I was caught riding Evolve Bamboo GT on the streets of Berlin in November. Police returned the board in December and applied 1200 euro penalty. I was given an opportunity to explain myself in the court).
Earlier this week I went to court. I ended up not involving the lawyer as the cost would be equal to the penalty.
(I am extremely thankful for offering me the donations by the way)

I prepared a presentation about electric longboards. I explained that I was acting in good faith and I did not mean to break the law. When I got to the point of presenting some documents, The judge interrupted me and offered to cancel the penalty! I was also taught that documents I brought were not strong enough. I think only the lawyer would be able to use them correctly in my defense. 
I promised that I will not use the board since it is not legal. 

I am considering keeping it in my storage hoping esk8 will be legalised in Germany in 2018.
Otherwise I would like to sell it for 1200 euro (in case anyone is interested).

Thank you for all the support and help in building the case. 
Be careful out there!

as a german resident - they will ned about 3 or 4 more years to even make a law for this.

as a tip, the internal police letters tell that they even look for hoverboards. the police in my city (around 40k inhabitants) just postet that on facebook. 

so drive in germany as much you want - dont get caught. thats the best advice i can give you.

when they see you, and you think they might chase you. just fucking move the fast you can before they get you. pretend to not see them or else and drive in small ways or so.

because if you got their interest, the chances are pretty low they let you go without anything. this is my experience.

I lately contacted my local MP and asked him whether they will soon introduce new laws regarding electric skateboards.
However he didnt answer...

I am taking place in a competition called "Jugend forscht", which you may compare to Science Fairs. 
My project is about making electric skateboards safer to operate by using sensor data.

I have already won the first round and will take place in the state competition next week. 
Probably  I will have the chance to talk to some higher tier politicians and make them aware of the issue. 

Guess chances will be good that they will at least listen as the competition takes place in stuttgart which will soon face bans for diesel-powered cars due to the air beeing polluted.

Unfortunately politicians didnt show up this year.
However I talked to a lot of people and made them aware of the issue. 

They were all quite astonished that riding small electric vehicles in general is highly illegal and agreed that the situation is not acceptable considering their relevance for clean, daily commution.

Probably it is our best chance for now to tell our people about our situation.

I live in munich and commute by esk8 about 3-4 times a Week. Whenever I see the police I try to not react in any way or even push like on a normal board: everything has been ok till today....

A scooter would be more discrete, but maybe not as enjoyable as an esk8.

Thanks for response. Bought a longbboard (not electric) and found out, that I cannot ride it without motor, mostly because it has no brakes, and kick pushing is just uncomfortable for me without handlebars, but because several people got fined, I didn't manage to buy motor in the end. 

Also I find myself in fear riding eboard, looks like I'm getting old =). And now I wonder what to do/buy.

I have been riding in Munich continuously for 2 weeks now. Saw quite a few cops. Acted as casually as possible. Nothing happened so far.
Met a guy the other day who had an inboard m1. Seemed legit. Said 2 of his friends got busted and both got a 150eur fine and one traffic register point. 
Compared to the 1200 fine @Woytec got, that really seems okay. 
Although in the end as I understand it he got off with a warning thanks to a merciful judge.

I'm trying to avoid cops when riding my mountainboard and i'm also riding really defensive in public spaces. Especially when i see kids around i'm mostly at 10km/h or less. Sunday i rode right past a cop car with 4 of them in it. 
Crawled at 6km/h past them as they already saw me and hopping off would increase the chance of them stopping me i thought. They looked kinda funny at me but didn't say anything. 
Maybe only because they had other things to do as they were driving on a bicycle lane in the public park.

Guess it depends on your location and the mood of the officers that day. This was in Gera, Thuringia, and the police is definitely busy with other people. So as long as i don't pose a threat to anyone i assume it's fine by them.

Let me recite myself here:

"drive in germany as much you want - dont get caught"

german politicians are mostly funded by the industry, if it doesnt bring money - it will take ages..


a very curious funny thing bout motorcycle rules that is pretty new:

Since Dec 2016, if you have the drivers license for curbed bikes (called A1 for up to 125cm2/15hp and A2 for 48hp) and you buy a un-curbed bike and put a throttle in it, the maximum horsepower it can have **BEFORE** throttle-ing is 95hp.

Like wtf, how does it matter if my bike has 110 or 95 horsepower when i must throttle it to 48hp?!

fuck germany, seriously

Hey everyone, 
i'm new to the forum and have signed up due to a case i've had with the police today - i saw some posts @Woytec   and have had a similar situation, although i hope to not go through what he did!
basically - i was near Wannsee, Berlin and skated 10m on the public road before turning right onto a road that leads through the forest to kleinmachnow. the police saw me turn into the road, and then noticed me speed up the hill (i was always under 10km/h!)
they pulled me over and told me they need to verify that the board cannot go more than 6km/h. they confiscated the Evolve GT board, but did not ask for my remote controller. they asked me to see my phone, which i pulled out, and they mentioned on the Incident Description paper that it is operated via Handy. 
they said it will take 3-4 days up to a week to verify the speed. but i don't know how they can do this without the remote - is it possible they will come back to me to ask for this? has anyone had their evolve board confiscated before?
i have shown them i have a driving licence, but they said that because it's 4x wheels, and motorised i need to be insured. but there are no e-board insurance policies, as far as i know.
i read some quite horrifying stories on the forum, and i am a little scared. i just got the board not even a week ago. 
i have called Evolve distributors and had Jens on the phone, who told me there was a similar case here in Berlin, and that the person involved was prepared to go to court with some information, and then the lawyer told him that the case had been dropped.

i did find a reddit thread where someone found EU-Law that states that electric skateboards are excluded from being considered cars - but this was for the Customs union...
http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/DE/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32015R0386 

do i risk a 1200 Euro fine? do i have to go to court? is there any way i can contest the confiscation? 
ANY sort of information will help!

i also don't speak good german, as i have moved here one year ago and would really like to avoid any sort of legal process.

thanks for the help in advance!

Hey, sorry to hear this. Jens was reffering to me there :) 
Something I learned from all of this is to relax. You dont have your board for now but you will get it back. You are likely to get the same fine as i did but you will be able to make it go away. It will take a lot of time. Perhaps few months. When you get the court invite, Just be well prepared, get your story streight, you will need to convince them that you meant no disrespect to the law and that you are sorry. You will end up not paying anything or just a small fine. Keep us informed here. It will help others later to stay sane :)

I think the solution is fixing the asinine laws and not devising ways to break them.

The facts are on our side, electric skateboards are the most energy-efficient non-animal-powered transportation humans have ever created and it's becoming increasingly more relevant as the climate gets more and more fucked.

If the German people want to keep their idiotic laws, then that is the problem, and not the way the electric skateboards are designed.

well, our laws may be _idiotic_ to _some individuals_, but they do have a purpose for a good reason. i do not agree with every law but the fact that a skateboard without a separated brake system (if the electronics fail) can't do a emergency braking without throwing the driver off the board, is very inappropriate for the streets. 

Car drivers, especially old people will have much problems recognizing super fast vehicles like these boards or do not even think about that these things can go so fast. i want to recite myself here for exact this reason:

> ABSOLUTELY no one in a car will think of us as an electrified vehicle, so if you’re driving on streets or paths that cross streets where cars drive, always drive very foresighted!

this is a rising problem because more people will enter this electrify-anything scene. i seriously say fuck germany, but if they will make laws, then we will have wattage limits of 500W or so. I bet both of my hands for this.

so, the more i agree with you, the more i'll have to disagree with you because in your eyes it is "just a law", but you have to think deeper about this.

end of this statement: the implementation of a duty cycle kill switch would be the best idea in this case.

@b264  German laws at the moment are stupid because they are outdated. You're not getting that it was never specifically declared illegal, so our point that "the people have spoken out against skateboards" makes no sense. Nobody want's it illegal. It's simply an artifact from what was defined for "motor vehicles" that weight several tons. German legislation simply sucks at adapting. 

And @Acidfie, what's really retarded about the law is that it makes no difference between a skateboard and a tank. If it's faster than 6 km/h it's a motor vehicle. And that's stupid. I'm from Germany myself, and currently living in the US. And it's definitely true that Germany to some extend benefits from everything being well regulated compared to countries like the US. But this typical German attitude "the law is the law" is in many cases also harmful. For example in the early days of Segways they tried to enforce seatbelt law, which makes those things total deathtraps. Police and lawmakers didn't care. "Germany has a seatbelt law, so you need to follow it, no matter how dangerous it is."

if that where true, then im sure we had a law that gave everyone a few thousends bucks just for beeing allive.

laws are there to protect people and the society. and tbh, i can completly understand why the state / society doesnt want a bunch of completly untested and probably dangerously self made vehicles on the street out there.

my main problem is that a dam electric bycicle is more dangerous then my dam skateboard is.

in my eyes a electric bike is way more safer than a board:
* brakes at every time
* i can brake very strong without tilting forward or fly down from it
* saddle
* people know its a bike and see you easier moving.

@Mathias you are absolutely right that german laws are outdated. sure some laws are absolutely awful but do you think when the government will allow skaterboards that travel at about 50kph what happens with society?

every god damn idiot out there will buy such a thing and drive like the last idiot around with it. this is a fact.

if they make a law, the will slow the boards to 15 kph or 1000W or something like this. then you can throw your board away with 2x 2,5kW motors. even the mountainboards will get problems because driving on streets in the woods or so. there are so many things to think of.

i sure want a law that allows me to drive the board, but this will need very much time since its not just about "using a motorized skateboard"

but also weights quite a bit more and depending on your skateboard setup, doesnt realy break any faster (sometimes even slower) and is sort of a trap when smashing into a car ;)

i do understand your points however, it takes some skill (and proper mindset) to drive a esk8 safly.

[/quote]

and driving a bike not, beside the ability to ride it in the streets.

lets do some maths:

braking with my bike when i am in danger:

braking from 25kph (maximum allowed speed the motor supports) to 0 kph

25kph = 7m/s
you have 1s reaction time means you travel 7 meters before reacting,
then you have to full brake with your bike, which was researched by

> Bäumler, H.: Bremsverzögerungen von modernen Fahrrädern. Verkehrsunfall und Fahrzeugtechnik 47 (2009), pp. 347 – 349 (#11)

you can go with 5.5m/s safely without having an accident.

a = v^2/2s which means braking would need about 9.1 meters.

now think of this with a eboard, this means if you would do a really good fullbrake standing, you would be flying away.

but you can also easily jump off. try that on a bike ;)

i am mostly referring to the footprint (size) of a bike aggainst a skateboard and also its weight.

also, i am not concerned about my health, its actualy the health of others. 
an normal ebike is way larger and also somwhere arround the 20kg mark. smashing my bike, including me, into a person seems way more dangerous then just me and the board. especialy since i can (and did) jump off (and probably creating a new threat "loose board" in the process).

i might be wrong here, but at least thats how i feel.

PS: wasnt going to start a discussion about that, especialy not in this thread ;)

Seeing how good the track record of drones is vs electric bikes and skateboards and how over regulated drones are now in Germany...I have good hope that ESK8 will be legal within 5 years, limited at a speed of 3 km/h and a maximum weight of 250 gram + fireproof registration numbers visible from a distance greater than 1 km. If it weighs more than 250, you need a CDL/truckers drivers license.

Hey everyone - just to give an update on the situation: i was never invited to court!
the police officer called me this morning and told me i need to go to the police station in Steglitz to pick up the eboard tomorrow at 10am. he told me they will file a report and i would get my board back. - i will update you all with what happens.

so - i gave my statement, which was pre-typed by the police officer and it read: " I did not know i couldn't use Electric Longboards on the public road" - this will then be sent to the court, and in 3-4 months i will receive a verdict - either go to court and defend myself and/or pay a fine - at the station i tried to argue my points with the officer and he said:
you can't use it on the street because it is not insured.
(showing him Allianz's response to the fact it is unnecessary to insure an e-board) he said: yes you don't need insurance, because it is a sporting equipment, and can only be used on private grounds.
THEN i asked, but what if i kickpush it? and he said that's fine. so i guess the same rule always applies - don't get caught? :wink: 
on a separate note - there is a big mellow meetup @Woytec told me about, in tempelhof on sunday 20th May - i guess it would be nice if people can join and maybe bounce ideas with each other on how to get things moving?
i think that for the rule that Kick-pushing is allowed, the Mellow Board "endless" mode could technically be Legal in germany? as it is not an acceleration with a throttle, but rather an assisted motion, which gradually decreases in speed, until pushed again? 
also - what if we get the media/newspaper/ tv news involved in a story about E-boards and light e-vehicles in general? would people be willing to speak up? or have any connections in a media outlet they know? 
we could make the points about it being as safe as an e-bike, if not more; that it's environmentally friendly? and other points?

@iconZo19 hi man! Hope everything will go great with your case. I just bought the e-board as well and i'm living in Berlin.  (still waiting for it, so I'm considering maybe to cancel the order)

I only now realized that it is so crazy here with the boards. Do you think it will be a good idea to cancel it, since it seems that it is completely prohibited to ride it on public streets? 

main idea was to commute to the work and back home, but now it seems impossible for me in this city.

Hey! well, the e-board is loads of fun (which one did you order?), i had bought it to save on commuting times too - and got caught on the way to work, on a forest road with no one else there - so i was very noticeable. 
you can NOT use it on public roads for now - either you wait it out and hope they move the legislation forward (i've heard it might happen this year) or use it but don't get caught by cruising around at a speed that looks like you could push at, then you should be fine. 
it really is up to you, but i was very disappointed when i got the board back and knowing i can't use it freely. 
i did take it to tempelhof yesterday and its great to carve around, but it still feels like a caged animal having to take it there on the train rather than riding.

But then I always get mad when I read the statements by those politicians saying stuff like "We're gonna make Germany a role model", and you dare using words like "innovation", when you're simply a couple of years late to the party. Like the promise Germany is gonna be a role model for digital innovation by trying to make public wifi happen in 10 years or so. Politics by dinosaurs for dinosaurs.

Don't move just yet... Look at the proposition: not only is it not through the parlament yet. What they'll be voting on is not even legalizing it in Hamburg, but just to CHECK how one could legalize it, and to give a report until end of September...

Even if it passes, it's probably gonna be years before something actually happens. My only hope is that EU will make regulations and that Germany will follow a few years later. Also EU enforcing clean air laws would help, I guess.

Hey guys, 
I though I would also share my story that just happened yesterday in Dusseldorf (Sunday 11th of June) I was riding an eskate back home a small 28inch one. I was riding slowly on a large sidewalk (I had the board for about less than a month and i was using it everyday and I was respecting traffic rule  same than a bike) 
The cops decide to pull me over while I was actually walking with the board in my hand ( i always push on the board when I see a police car just in case) They explained me that I cannot use the board in Germany, anywhere unless it is on a private property, they checked the board, asked me a few questions (they were actually really interesseted int eh board that it made me feel like I was doing a sales speech), They eventually let me go without a fine or anything but I cannot use the board anymore.
So if I have an advice, yes you can ride it and not get caught ( however according to the german law you are doing something illegal) until the day some cops decide to stop you and then the problem can starts. E skate is super fun, for a millions reason and it is a great way of transport but riding it with the fear of being stopped and pottentially getting a fine is not worth all this trouble. It is very sad to say

Because they have a push assist mode, which is probably not entirely unproblematic if one can easily switch to regular e-skate mode, but at least it's a gray area.
As far as I know the law says that if a vehicle cannot accelerate on it's own beyond 6 km/h, if the power doesn't exceed 250 W, and if the power cuts out entirely above 25 km/h then it is legally not a motor vehicle.

The real question here is: Will this affect the decision on whether electric skateboards should be legalised or not.

In my opinion is kind of dumb and ridiculous to use this particular cases to ban electric-skateboards. With that mindset we should ban cars and any other appliance that can be set on fire spontaneously.

Although I think it should be regarded as cautionary tale for all of use that we are after all dealing with a battery.

I just hope this doesn't set back any conversation on our direction.

19. Welche Arten von Elektrokleinstfahrzeugen sollen bis zu welcher zulässigen 
Höchstgeschwindigkeit für die Nutzung auf dem Gehweg und welche auf 
den Fahrbahnen zugelassen werden, und welche Vorgaben für Mindestalter, 
die Kennzeichnung und die Versicherung sind vorgesehen? 

Elektrokleinstfahrzeuge sollen im Verordnungsentwurf u. a. mit einer bauartbedingten
 Höchstgeschwindigkeit von mindestens 12 km/h bis maximal 20 km/h 
definiert werden. Die geplante Verordnung über die Teilnahme von Elektrokleinstfahrzeugen
 am öffentlichen Straßenverkehr beinhaltet zulassungs-, fahrerlaubnis
-, genehmigungs- und verhaltensrechtliche Aspekte. Elektrokleinstfahrzeuge
 sollen zukünftig verkehrsrechtlich wie Fahrräder mit der Maßgabe besonderer
 Vorschriften behandelt werden.

Hello! Anyone here from Darmstadt/Frankfurt area? Would be nice to get together somehow. I got stopped by police once here in Darmstatd and in the end they where nice. They just told be it's illegal and you can't ride it. 

I faked saying that I was not aware and I apologized saying that I would take the bus. From that time I try not to ride anymore during the day :frowning:

Oh really?!? This would be pathetic...
20km/h is not that fast to really require a physical break and if so, we would find a way to engineer one.
But requiring some kind of 'direct' steering like with escooters but excluding a steering based on balancing it just a bummer. 
I would love to drive around in the city without the need to fear the police... 😢

I have been contemplating this some time ago. Hear me out. Perhaps someone could help to take this idea further...
Considering there are clear guidelines for what makes a vehicle relevant for permit... (what defines it as a scooter or ebike)
If so, then what is the MINIMUM required to call something a steering wheel? What is the minimum for something to act as a breaking system? etc... 
If it's all what it takes to make a board legal, then can I install some dummy breaks that don't do anything really, (or work a little) or can I just add some tiny handlebars to the front of the board so legally all checkboxes are ticked?

sounds like its 50% no breakes and 50% no steering wheel.
the brakes part i totaly understand, the steering wheel part not so much ... .

if it would just have been the breakes, then adding those would be a small price to pay.
probably safer anyway. i had remote cutouts in the worst possible situations ...

What would be the worst case scenario when being "caught".
I think there should be nothing wrong using our boards and sticking to all the rules that count for people riding bikes. But thats unfortunately still a distant dream.
If I ride where bikes are allowed and stick to their rules, what would happen when the police decides they want to stop me?

So from all the cases I've heard there have always been 3 options. They 
A. let you off with a warning
B. give you a 120eur fine and that's it
C. confiscate you board, you get a 1k-1.5k fine from the judge, which is dropped after a hearing. Also you get your board back after some time

in the eSkate VESC app you can set a max erpm limit.
so you just need to calculat according to your gearing whats the erpm for 6km/h.
than save it as setting and upload it to the vescs if necessary via Bluetooth.

I don´t use Metr or Acks app, guess with them it should work too

i´m sure you can somehow get it done with an arduino.
in case you want just to switch form one mode to the other by remote.
But I have no clue how :sweat_smile:

It´s not on the fly, but to stop and push the upload button in the app is not so a big deal i think.

just remind the thumb remote with all the drop outs.
there you can change between slow and fast.
wonder how they realize it there, maybe there is a way to modify it that the slow mode is only 6km/h :thinking:

Basically what we need. AFAIK, the vesc-tool currently only sees one PPM channel.
Still listed as to do here:
https://vesc-project.com/node/110

@Ackmaniac. Is this perhaps implemented in your firmware?

Alternative, do the mixing with an arduino in between. You can feed multiple channels into the arduino and for example apply a range mapper type function when a second channel has a certain value. I'm not a big fan of putting additional hardware in between signal and vesc that can fail.

Like I mentioned, a mixer can be setup if your remote can be programmed (opentx type software, etc). These remotes are clunky and big though, g2tb sizes, probably https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-gt5-6ch-2-4ghz-afhds-2a-surface-radio-w-gt5-receiver.html)

Best Solution to change the speed is with the Ackmaniac Firmware with Bluetooth Chip.
Power up the Board 
Police is default Riding settings (6kmh)
Change to unlocked 
Have fun

If you encounter the police switch your Board off which Sets it back to police Mode (default Mode) automatically. Then they can test it as long as they want.

The traffic change is progressing: Electric micro-vehicles will probably be in 2019 in Germany finally led in a separate vehicle class.

Yeh got it translated now:

This part seems interesting:

> Self-balancing vehicles are allowed up to 1,200 watts

Would also be great if they allowed speeds of up to 35-40kph, with helmet on.. 

They justified 20kph max speed due to not using helmets, it seems..

Also yes, proper infrastructure is not in place.. so legal limit of 40kph might be dangerous for cyclists on cycling roads.. 

(if it is busy riding, not just one or two riders)

We made an appointment with the ministry of transportation and organized a demonstration for the legalization of all LEV afterwards. 

And rode that demonstration around 10KM thru Berlin - official demonstrations get police help. Would not call this a group ride. 

But you see - actions like these got attention and the ministry is reacting.

Our plan is another **demo in march 2019 on a sunday in berlin**, if law is still not in place.

E-bike is a monster, even at 250W.
Granted, it's not as much fun. 

Cops left me alone last week. In the woods I reach around 42 km/h max before the gearing becomes problematic.

They will check my board and inform me whats next to do. That sucks. The max board speed 9km/h  / 10.000erpm. Still to much for germany...

Yeah, Germany is really way behind regarding micro/personal mobility. And the Police sometimes has no better things to do than harrassing people. Did you fakepush? Using a Electric Scooter and always fakepushing. many times police passed by or stood in front of me at the traffic lights/intersection and nothing happened.

It sucks that you know that the police is not there to help but there to harass. Germany totally working against any technical progress.

So you capped at 9kmh?

It seems like Mr Scheuer has signed some kind of regulation but only for scooters?! Stuff without handlebars seems to get a special treatment...

"Für Geräte ohne Lenkstange wird eine Ausnahmeverordnung geschaffen. Dieser muss der Bundesrat nicht zustimmen. Das Verkehrsministerium geht deshalb davon aus, dass solche Fahrzeuge noch im ersten Halbjahr 2019 legal auf öffentlichen Wegen gefahren werden dürfen. An den Details der Regelung, beispielsweise wo diese Geräte fahren dürfen, arbeitet das Ministerium noch. [Denkbar wäre, dass solche Hoverboards künftig auch für Gehwege zugelassen werden](https://www.tagesspiegel.de/berlin/verkehr-gutachter-haelt-e-roller-auf-gehwegen-fuer-verfassungswidrig/24035294.html).

The proposal for scooters with handlebar is now online. It's worth to take a look. 50 pages of pure germaness. They have defined everything. Even the curb the thing needs to be able to pass and all the fees, e.g. driving two scooters next to each other: 15€. Oh and let's not forget the official street sign for an area where you are allowed to drive escooter...

https://www.bmvi.de/SharedDocs/DE/Gesetze-19/entwurf-verordnung-teilnahme-elektrokleinstfahrzeuge-strassenverkehr.html

Unfortunately no news for esk8s. Only a tweet by the BMVI:
"Die Ausnahmeverordnung für Geräte ohne Lenk-/Haltestange wird gleichzeitig auf den Weg gebracht. So werden #Hoverboards etc. im 1. Halbjahr 2019 gefahren werden können. Die Ausnahmeverordnung ist nicht zustimmungspflichtig im #Bundesrat, dadurch ist das Verfahren recht schnell."

So spring is now first half of the year...

Feel free to write your comment on that tweet :wink: https://twitter.com/BMVI/status/1100690031637905408?s=19

Germany fucks it up as always. So the e-scooter lobby with their own rental scooters will be more or less the only ones who win here. More or less the same as they did for segways. Even if they allow boards for a while there will not be many brands who will have the money to go through the process to get all official papers (abe).
And DIY is as illegal as it was before.

Yeah, they Fucked up big time. But it seems all calculated. Put the MAX allowed Speed to 20KM/h so all the cheap and some of them really good Scooters are OUT! . Further you are a impediment on the Bike-Lane. So it's dangerous. Even a not motorized Bike gets easily over 25KMH. Then if no Bike Lane available you are forced to Ride on the Street with all the Cars. With 20KMH... SO dangerous big time. Then you need a generall allowance for your Scooter Model, and you need two independent brake Systems and you need an insurance and a plate. WTF is wrong with these people?!?!?!?!

All driven by the lobby work. No one of them responsible did think one second about this mess.

Why can I ride with a pedelec without general allowance, without insurance more than 25KMH? 

This is kind of a pathetic joke. 

Germany "Technikland" ... You had a chance and messed it all up again...

At least the traffic sign Industry is making good money. Millions of additional signs to be put up and these also need service. Each sign costs 150 Euro minimum. That is where the real business is. 

The e-boards might be forbidden soon, if accidents happen. 
Going through the process of acquiring an ABE is time consuming and expensive and the day your product has an ABE, might be the day that regulations are revoked and everything is back to zero. Typical for Europe is that each country will have different regulations in place, and your product needs to be country specific and needs 30 different ABEs. 

I'm already thinking of where to attach the bell with a high pitch sound to the remote.
You can be sure that most if the regulations found in the scooter paper will be applied to e-board. Luckily our Trampaboards can roll over a 3cm curb in all angles....

Unfortunately no news, only the info that they want to approach this topic super conservative, to avoid 'mistakes' other countries made by allowing all that stuff.

But at least the are heavily thinking about flying taxis... :roll_eyes:

it came out exactly like i said: they made a law just for the german car industry, because their is almost no chance to get scooters with only 20kmh except from bmw which will be super duper expensive(Dear BMW-stick it up your bum to feel your greed)
Every company which is still renting scooters can now kill themselves for investing in a dead rabbit.
That is german government: spreading laws not for public profit and change, they are just doing laws for Mamon and the Nazi leftovers from bmw.
Ich könnte kotzen!...
Edit: end of the story is we have to get insurance for a toy going 20kmh and we probably have to pay taxes therefor as well. We are just allowed to ride these toys on bike lanes and the streets which is really suicide imo.
No chance here to change something with a government just creating laws for rich companies in order to get them more profit.
If you speak your mind you are degraded as a Nazi, but the real helpers of the Nazis are still in the position to get pressure on the government to feed them fat asses for all time while concealing they got rich because of forced labor in the 3rd reich.
editedit: sorry for being so political but this really pissing me off and had to be said.
BMW hail!

[/quote]

And the real strange part is: They are celebrating themselvs for "legalizing" e-scooters... With this law taking place in weeks or months none of the cheap and really good Scooters (like the M365) are legal, even with the new law. And they even didn't include all other potential "new" (as in new for germany) e-ridables. This is pathetic... Yeah, everyone should buy the big clunky scooters from BMW or Metz for 2000€ ... You can not even put these in a normal sized trunk of a normal sized car/limousine.

Why so complicated? Why not looking for solutions which are long time established in the neighbour countries? France?? German answer: "Oh no, they are all dead by now because of scooters/e-ridables." Austria?? German answer:  "Oh, no, they are all insane anyway. They treat scooters equal as E-Bikes.!... NONONONONO! Scooters don't have a seat, are you insane????"

With this law in place you will be a dangerous, slow pacing, peace of potential roadkill which is always a hindrance for either the bikes on the bike lane or cars on the road/street. 

And than the argument that 25 km/h would be too fast increasing the risk for an accident...
And in the same time argumenting that a common speed limit of 130km/h on "Autobahn" is insane and not recommended...

FU!DE!Politics!

It's really frustrating.

The only companies benefitting are Scooter sharing companies, dropping tons of _crap on wheels devices_ onto the sidewalks. Average survival rate of sharing scooters: 29-60 days. 
They don't make money with renting out scooters, they make money with a spying App that you have to intall to rent out the scooters. The real cash is in user data, position data, your address book etc. This data is sold to third parties. It's all about data.

All you need will be a software update to limit the speed to 20km/h and your M365 should be good to go.
We will have to see how the Police will judge the rating - ebikes for example can in theory go faster than 25km/h as they are not hardware bound to this speed - it's all a virtual limitiation in the software.
Or did I miss some section in the law that talks about necessary hardware restrictions?

You also sound like somebody who never had an accident with an esk8 - I had one and let me tell you: there is a night and day difference between bikes and esk8s or scooters. You have much (much) more control on a bike during an emergency situation!

Does anyone know what the consequences are for riding an electric skateboards with these new laws (max speed, insurance). I wonder if the police will treat it differently now. Since it is more clear that riding a skateboard is riding without an insurance etc.

What could be the consequences? Fines and other punishments.

I want to know if it's "worth the risk" :smiley:
