Just got my [Boosted Clone](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/boosted-clone-vanguard-f-3-dual-75kv-hubmotors-90mm-10s4p-25r-foc/30619) running and while there's still a lot to get done I've noticed that it feels incredibly "not premium". I attribute this to the poor VESC settings I've got at the moment and that the enclosures needs adjusting.

So what makes your board feel premium?

Hmm...I guess overall reliability would be top of the list, always ready to ride, tuned settings are a must, I need to be able to burn rubber off the line if I want to and brake slide to a stop. Weather shouldn't be a factor other than my own desire to weather it ðŸ˜‹

Hehe :wink: Agreed, but it can be pretty hard to splash/waterproof enclosures on certain boards. At least if you want to be able to open it again.

What features more exactly? The changing of the throttling curve seems nice, but I believe you can do that on the new Vesc Tool as well?

A good remote.
maybe some lights.
Custom Grip-tape (maybe copy the look from Evolve) 
And a story of how you board uses high quality components and was hand made ;)

No1 is reliability, it's really hard to get things very reliable for an amateurs builders. You'll need to go through various builds to discover weaknesses and strength points. No sudden stop at high speed. No kick start. No flimsy wireless connection. No cogging. The list can go on....

No2 is repairability. True you don't need this if you have the No1, but things tend to break for unconventional reasons time to time. It's better to make it easy to repair so that 1 - 3 years from now you don't have to deconstruct the entire builds and wiring just to replace that 1 broken cell.

No3 is water-resistant. I can't mentioned this enough, but this needs to be done. The moment you can ride in any weather conditions is marvelous. I also like the fact I could just drop them under the shower and cleaned it up after each rides without worrying.

No4 is maintainability. 0 Maintenance build + plug & play. Seriously, I take this consideration seriously. The more plug and play, the more easy to maintain. I like idiot proof things.

No5 is compliant to any surface given. eMTB comes on top here, where you can just have a comfortable ride in gravelly and paved roads. Pavement easily destroyed eboards especially with hub motors. eMTB just ride and glides over it.

No6 is maximum distance. I cared for this alot compared to maximum speed. I prefer to enjoy longer rides instead of a fast ride fast drain. Long distance means you can actually travels with it point to point without ever worrying about pushing the board half the road.

No7 is compactness and lightness. The more compact and light, it's easier to transport. I think everyone here could agree on that, thats why eboard is here. But no matter how small and compact and light, if above criteria are not met, it's useless.

No8 is those gimmicks you add - The finishing touch!. This is the fun part and requires no explanations. Extra lights, custom paint jobs, custom battery box, custom wiring, custom electrical upgrades, custom mounts, custom drive unit, custom motors, custom custom and custom... Making it a unique build, your build. Off course, if these things are done poorly, it's just crap smashing build.

---

As you can see all of these points are quality build point of view. Thats the most important. The more quality you can pour into it, the more you will like it. The more you pour effort into it, the more you want to upgrade it. The more upgrades, the more attractive it will be. And so the downside of all are cost! Very costly build, but I can see here that members doesn't seems to mind alot spending 2k ++. I don't know why I think everyone here are rich, but if I still in high school wants the cool stuff, this just don't cut it. I guess eboards are just another type of expensive hobbies.

---

ONE ABSOLUTE thing all builders and members here can agree on is not the premium feelings, but not going home after 3 minutes rides with half a board, 3 broken parts and the need to pay for costly replacement parts + VAT that took 3 weeks to deliver.

A premium board should:

- give you a smoot ride
- give you a smooth acceleration
- should be very controlable during carving
- be very stable at high speeds
- have a responsive and very precise remote
- have no signal cutouts
- quiet operation
- be extremely powerful
- have loads of torque
- be beautuful and pleasing to the eye
- have awesome brakes
```

A board feels premium when it handles well (good VESC settings), and doesn't sound like it will rattle itself to death when riding - good bearings, snug screws, firm enclosures with no free objects such as connectors which cause rattling noise.

Maybe a little emotional, but for me premium is, when i build it by my self... i can't describe it better. But to choose the component, modding the deck, creating a small peace of art is for me not only uniqe, it's a kind of premium too. And then it is almost no matter, that the break are not smooth, or it's just lipo pack and not a 12s4p or the enclosure is just a lunchbox, or what ever. ðŸ™‚

I need to add, a board is premium when you go over potholes and bad roads and there is not a single rattle from the wheels and electronics inside the enclosure, when it feels compact and built like one piece

I accomplished that "premium feeling" with my Trampa build, with dual Trampa VESCs SIX, it finally is reliable. I can hose it down after muddy ride and not worry about electronics and battery being soaked with water. Power delivery and brakes are smooth when You need them to be, and also extremely powerfull. @rpasichnyk metr.app is another feature that makes it "premium". Last thing You want to have in a "premium board" is great finish, what I mean are nicely finished, quality parts, right materials (stainless screws if you plan to ride in the rain or mud), right parts connections that make the board tough and durable (using screws instead of using glue or shitty double sided tape).

Couple people have said this but wheels and quality skate hardware. If you have a bad esc the ride won't feel good while accelerating and braking. If you had bad wheels and bad hardware your ride is not going to feel good as soon as you step on the board.

This. This feels so premium. It's a $200 deck though. Feels broken in and so comfy under my feet. The Concave is perfect. ![IMG_20180203_183342_483|406x500](upload://ynMEpwf4sBvHwmhDAwLf1IujKs.jpg)

hall sensors are amazing to improve the smoothness and authority of low speed acceleration. 

Also lights. I like lights. My last build had a switchable high-low beam headlight and a tail light that brightens when you apply the brakes.
