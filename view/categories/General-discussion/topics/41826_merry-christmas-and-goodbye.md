Thought it would be best to let everyone around here know I wont be posting anymore or checking my PM's. We are doing some restructuring of the company and we will only be building and selling complete boards in 2018 to make room for some new developments that have come our way. Made some great friends here so this wasn't an easy decision but it is necessary for contractual reasons.  Best way to reach us from here forward is to use our contact on our website, just be warned you wont get a reply for a few days due to the holiday season. 

Have fun building the stoke, Chaka out!

Instead of a love icon, we need a hate icon! Cause I hate this... Chaka always had been on the forefront of upgrading the VESC. It's sad to see you go, but I know this is the natural evolution in the eskate world these days. Best of luck moving forward! I know you don't need luck though, haha. :sob:

Is it strictly mandatory that you don't come around here at all? You can always come to post a couple of pictures and check the new builds üòÄ
