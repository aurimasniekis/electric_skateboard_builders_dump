Hey guys I am 14 and new to this whole electric long board thing and I am looking to build my first board for under 500 U.S. Dollars. I'm wondering if this kit is any good. https://www.amazon.com/Nucbot-Electric-skateboard-longboard-controller/dp/B01M005SUK/ref=lp_15623634011_1_1?srs=15623634011&ie=UTF8&qid=1478655423&sr=8-1
Please tell me if it is or isn't. My current long board is this https://www.amazon.com/Surf-One-Robert-Complete-Longboard/dp/B000FZ4T5C/ref=sr_1_13?ie=UTF8&qid=1478655670&sr=8-13&keywords=longboard+complete . I am on a really tight budget and I can't find a motor mount that will work and I cant really afford to buy new trucks and wheels. If someone could make me a parts list that would be good for me I would really appreciate that. Thanks guys.

I would not recommend though.

Ok. So the kit that you are looking at has a few rip-off hints.
1. It comes from an unknown source.
2. You will notice that it says ESC. You going to want VESC, if you don't know what that is, google it.
3. It is so cheap it leads me to believe it to be a Chinese rip off.

I suggest keep looking.
By the way, I am also 14, and on the hunt for a good longboard for my electric skateboard. Is that one too long?

Are you asking if my deck is to long?

Yeah, I'm like 5' 5" and I'm trying to find a good length. Is yours a good size?

Isn't that deck too flexy? And I would not recommend building on that deck, it is made for dancing and a surfboard feel.

Im about the same height as you and I really like my board. Its a good length and easy to cruse on, if i were you I would buy a longboard with paris trucks because they don't make a mount for the Randal trucks.

The board is less flexy then loaded boards and if I position every thing close to the trucks and use risers for the trucks the flex should not matter right.

Depends, which loaded deck? And it also depends on what battery you use, those boards usually flex throughout the whole deck.

I would use two 3s lipo batteries(Put in Series) from Hobby King. And the board mainly flexes in the middle.

If you use a flexy deck, you either have to put everything in a small enclosure on one side (if it fits) or split it in two like Boosted. Also, you will have to get/make a motor mount that you can weld to those trucks. Otherwise, go with Caliber's that will work with screw mounts. Your wheels are non-standard, so you will need to drill them to get a pulley on there. Those wheels look a little small, so make sure you have enough clearance for a belt. 

If I was that tight on cash, I wouldn't go the DIY route. More often than not, people end up with unexpected expenses. Not really a bad thing, but enclosures, solder, shrink tube, foam rubber, wires, connectors, belts, welding, trial and error, shipping... all add up. Plus if something goes wrong and you fry a VESC or receiver, you won't find yourself way over budget. If you had a couple hundred extra bucks to blow and have a lot of the tools on hand, it would be a different story. 

For $500, I'd go with this:

The guy who sells these is on this forum LeVer. I haven't tried one, but he has a good record of standing behind his products. It may not have the best stats, but you really can't beat the price. If you want a longer deck, you can always pull off all the hardware and mount it on a different board.
