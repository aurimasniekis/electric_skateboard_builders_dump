After surviving a couple of falls lately the value of having good safety gear 
has been hammered home literally you might say.

Leather is favoured by riders due to its excellent abrasion protection and flexibility.
But the cost of buying new quality leathers is prohibitive $600 $800 +

I recently started looking for second hand leathers, good quality at affordable prices.
Its important to remember the leather saves your skin but the body armour takes the hit.

Different types of cowhide are still the most common sources of leather with kangaroo hide
 now favoured due to its lighter weight and stronger abrasion resistance. Thickness is not as 
important as quality â€“ and good quality strong leather should be soft and fairly supple.
 
Lets not forget fit...there shouldn't be any saggy bitts that loose stuff may bunch up and grab in a slide. 
Leather will relax and form around your body to a certain extent over time.  Some initial tightness is fine.

You can have all the best gear but you still got to be wearing it.

I'm going to post some links to second hand leathers I think might be good value.

It's up to the individual to follow through and hopefully post there findings.
I encourage members in general  to post any findings they happen upon so others may grab a bargain.

This lady's name is Dessy, she has a eBay site that sells second hand quality leathers in Greece.
Select something then, contact the seller tell her your from esk8.builders let here know your size
 and what you are looking for. A lot  of her stock is offline and she imports new goodies weekly.
 Please be patient she has a real job as well lol. 

She found me a full IXS Suit in my size almost perfect measurements for $110 US + freight.

Words from the Lady herself.
"The Cafe Racer style  60'-70's european leathers looks really cool but are rarely equipped with protectors.
 Most of them are just fabricaly padded, so I don't think this is the best "safety" choice. Suits from the early 80s 90s double hip and knee padded, solid shoulder and elbow protectors are what you are looking for, in my opinion." 

I plan to wear modern lightweight body armour under my leathers. Depending on the body armour you might need to size up. Some of the new stuff like the Demon Flex Force X D3O V3 Body Armour is very slimline and light weight. The Alpinestars  Mx Bionic Action Black Red Off Road Motocross Body Armour Jacket is really good kit as well but a bit bulkier.

I wanna get some leathers but for now lots of hard shell pads work fine for me. What a deal here!

Not quite as fashionable though.

Kevlar and motorcycle jackets work well for me as for my legs I only wear knee and shin pads.

I originally just bought leather pants because I only had the knee guards but nothing for the rest of my legs, hips arse, etc. It pays to be confident in any sport...pool for example: As you line up that shot...in my head I'm thinking there not a chance of this missing and I'm visualising the black going down the slot.

I'm not thinking if I miss I'll have to shout this prick another beer.

Same when riding I'm going to make that corner â€¦.not worrying what might happen if you don't lol

Not exactly leathers, but people who are concerned about road rash can always get some motorcycle gear. I think my top was like 160, pants were 80. Super good deal IMO.

It's got knee, shin, hip (including rear hip), collar bone, shoulders, elbows, forearms, and most importantly spine protection. It's not restrictive at all too, which is nice.

Personally I would love a nice set of leathers, but I would never trade in all this padding for something inferior.

Oh, and the white bits are all retroreflective

Just FWIW, i got road rash through a leather motorcycle jacket some years ago - meaning I was wearing the jacket when I laid a bike down and still got road rash. I am sure it was less than I would have received otherwise, but it did still happen.

I fell off my board last week wearing knee, elbow and wrist pads and still lost skin on my elbow - through the hard pad. Don't understand that one.

Where lucky we don't travel at motor cycle speeds..200 km +..

You see them come off in F1 and they slide forever...hopefully hitting nothing.
Sometimes you see them role over the other side of their leathers to escape the tremendous heat that's being generated...Same in downhill longboarding.


I have a friend who raced bikes he lost the front wheel at Phillip Island there's  a kink nearing the end of the straight. He kept trying to pick it back up....wore through his knee pad and burnt a hole in his leg...lol

Gloves people.  Good downhill gloves are a must if you're going 50k (30mph) plus.  First thing that most people do is put out a hand.  I have cut out the thumb on mine.
@mars
living where we live its important to be comfy too.  I don't use my bike leathers unless its deepest darkest winter which as you know rarely gets down to the freezing cold depths of 15' C  brrrrrr!   I have goretex and kevlar jackets and strides which suffice in the summer months.  Bit more breathing capabilities than full leathers I've found.  This only gets used though when I'm being silly.  Most of the time its just a good helmet and jeans but I always wear my gloves.  
Good thread mate.

I had a crash around 50-60kmh a few months back with nothing but a Mtb helmet. I took some bad cuts on my hands and jarred my knee. Luckily I was wearing lots of layers and managed to step and roll instead of slid which avoided most of the road rash. I have since bought some mtb gloves and a gform knee pads. The pads are great, I tested them with a hammer and no pain at all haha. I do want some Kevlar pants and maybe a hoodie though

Hitting your knee with a hammer...:rofl:


That's a very fast crash....you were seriously lucky...

I've been wearing a Draggin Roo Hoodie...and  tested it for real...haha it works well.

I recommend you look at them if your hunting a hoodie.

Haha well not jump in the air. Iâ€™m a fast runner naturally and thought I could run it out like my last falls around 40kmh so I took 2 steps then realised it wasnâ€™t going to work and smacked my knee on the ground then tucked into a roll and barrel rolled down the road until standing up just before hitting the gutter, talk about good timing. 

I meant hitting my knee with the hammer while wearing the gform pads haha. And Iâ€™ve seen those hoodies and they look great but a bit out of my price range. Iâ€™ve found a few on eBay that have some good reviews and people have tested them and say they held up well

Two steps...you must be frigging fast....haha
My first off maybe 20...25km one step tuck wrist shoulder bang roll roll I think.
The next thing some well wisher was saying....my my you did that well dear.....huh umm thanks 

The hoodie took all the hit on my shoulder.
I got up and thought I better do another lap there's people watching...lol
I look down as I'm going past the crash site on the next lap and some blood is dripping off my hand lol
Enough for today....lol

In theory you should be able with good knee pads and slide gloves land slide it out...hopefully not hit anything get up and laugh about it. :sunglasses:

Not bad, it has loads of air vents that you can zip open. So if you're moving at any reasonable speed you get decent airflow inside. Plus you can remove the winter liner from the inside.

Yeah sure, it's these:

I sized these up by 2 in so I can fit jeans or other pants underneath if necessary. They're very adjustable so they fit snug either way. They have boot zippers as well, no  need to remove shoes.

The jacket is this. I can't seem to find the same size on amazon anymore. I got a small. It's a good match to the pants IMO.

Hah, I just read this review on the pants and it gave me a load of peace of mind.
"I came around the top of a hill only to find a sharp descending hairpin turn with tons of gravel on the sides. I braked to bleed off as much speed as possible, went hard into the turn scraping my pegs on the street, and almost made it out unscathed until the wheels caught gravel and I lowsided at around 35mph. Slid for just about 100 feet on street, through gravel, then into a small ravine with shrubbery and trees. If you look at my legs now, you'd think I maybe wrestled too roughly on some carpet, just a very light friction burn on my lower left leg. Look at the pants, however, and they tell a different story. They're completely shredded, but most of it is where the padding is located. I was wearing nothing but boxers under them, the entire right ass cheek of the pant was torn open but it absorbed enough of the impact to leave a slight scuff on my boxers underneath."
