Great vid!!

What kind of board do you have that you can climb at 30mph?  And how do they organize it so the uphillers don't interfere with the downhillers?  IE can you only run during organized races?  Are there time windows?  Or is it a free-for-all?

The downhillers all go up in trucks, eskaters leave just before the trucks pull out, we all meet at the top the fast downhillers go first then the eskaters go. I was following the drift trikes, which was pretty fun.

Dude that thing is a monster!  Are you local to Seattle?  Are you going to race it at Derby Days?

Also I had no idea they had drift trikes.  Maryhill is sounding better and better.

Thanks for all the info.

I'm in Orange County, but have family in Seattle and around Hood River and Port Angeles, so I'm up in the NW as much as I can manage.

They're pretty open minded as to what goes up and downhill. Apart from Luge and Skateboards, and in addition to the drift trikes, there were soap box cars and roller skates. Next year I want to fabricate an adult sized green machine if I can manage it.

Maryhill looks like an unbelievably good time.  Killington is the closest event to me, but it lines up with Denver.  Typical.

I thought my board was somewhat fast.

I was wrong.

The new race format we're going to try for Race #3

 (     https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/uphill-race-3-backside-brawl-5/85383?u=moestooge ) 

will allow all speeds of boards to compete for a podium spot.

(format    https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/the-racers-room/29126/1116?u=moestooge  )

Will make consistency up the hill the key to podium, not speed.  See y'all at the hill
 
üèÅ cheers üèÅ

Honestly I would prefer a simpler format.
The podium should consist of the fastest guys in each category (2-3 categories are enough, no more)

I hate the everyone gets a medal/shot at the podium mentality.

Yeah, I am not a fan of the format. Fastest qualifying times should take lead at the start. Keeps it a little safer too.

One of the problems is that there have been so few participants. It's hard to split a handful of racers into classes. However, with enough racers I'd like to see classes for production boards, pneumatic boards, urethane wheeled boards plus an open class.

Definitely when the interest and board count is better we will see need for class separation.  This format has something at the finish line for everyone. Yeah it's like bracket racing at the drags but if 6 people show up, all will race the hill with purpose.
