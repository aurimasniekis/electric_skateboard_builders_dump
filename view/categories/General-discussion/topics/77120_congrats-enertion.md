Hi guys
Last year I had some trouble getting my Black Friday order from enertion boards. 
It took a little over 6 months to get 2 focbox and a nano. A simple order for my first ever eboard project. I was a little upset, as you would expect, but what impressed me the most was being immediately ‚Äúshushed‚Äù when I tried to bring the matter to discussion here at this forum.
Well, 
this year I decided to give it another try...
All I can say is that it went nothing less than perfect!!!
Order posted on the 23 Nov 
Package received on the 3 December  
(I live in Portugal btw)
Roughly 5 to 6 business days in one of the most busiest times of the year for freight companies.
I‚Äôm impressed, I must say.
Looks like Enertion Boards finally manage to figure it out. Congrats 
I‚Äôm assuming this post won‚Äôt be red flagged as last year‚Äôs üòÅ

*on this particular order this time 

Enertion are definitely getting ahead of the orders, nothing is perfect in this emerging industry though. Especially because it's pretty tiny.

I also received mine to UK from BF - I did not expect them this quick and was happy to be waiting until the new year, turned out the FIRST out of UK BF item I bought to arrive!

EDIT: also got an unexpected whistle thing, would never have bought one but since its here I might try it lol

I may or may not have ordered some parts from another seller with the same destination country :thinking:
But I'm waiting for USPS to pick up their slack (tracking hasn't updated in the last 4 days)
My quesiton is, did it stop in customs?

So you got what you ordered, but still found it necessary to take a dig at Enertion?

Agreed, good to see things went well for you but you don't need to point out historical mistakes if things are all good now. I'm sure we've all made mistakes in the past we're not proud of and would much rather be judged on our current state of character.

When people see the word ‚Äútruth‚Äù they gonna assume something bad is gonna be exposed, why? That‚Äôs just half of what this post is about. The OP did say the ‚Äútruth‚Äù - that is what he/she experienced with Enertion - both positive and negative. I don‚Äôt see the need to be so sensitive and then somehow steer the discussion to that forbidden topic :confused:
