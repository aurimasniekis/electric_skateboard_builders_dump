Would I need new trucks, I am thinking about drilling straight into the wheels. Also can anyone recommend the most basic motor I can get for a decent price. Im not looking to spend too much money. Any info would help. Thank you

The deck looks sweet should be fine pretty much any deck will work except dropped decks and really short ones. 
you can go with making your own motor mount? it would be alot cheaper if you have all the equipment.
I built my one for around $27 aud

depending on where you live (I Live in Australia) you may aswell buy abec fly wheel clones (witch allready have the holes in them)  if your from the us, I decided to drill my wheels as the wheels i was after were very hard to find in Aus

Yeah for a motor mount it really dosent matter but if your going to drill your wheels thats another story.

The hard part isn't the tools IMO,  I've built mounts before but they don't look like that thats for sure. I'll just spend the $60 bucks and save me 4 hours of work haha

ok steel welding will not work on aluminium. @lowGuido knows a bit about welding brackets on.
And yes the deck should be fine.

looks like the deck is made from bamboo, this normally means flexible. have you stood on it?

watch this video for some more tips.
