I looked for any topics about water proofing, but not much was to be found.

What measures of water proofing should one take if they wish to ride on splashing wet roads (but not actually raining)?

I read somewhere that motors don't have any issues with water, but I would love for someone with more knowledge to clarify this one. ?

Has anyone though about mudflaps?

My housing is so fat (when riding, it sits about an inch off the ground) that it absorbs most debrie on the bottom, and thus, my custom charger ports which are wide open on the upper side, never get splashed by the water and thus have been find thus far.

I wrap any wires in electrical tape to help prevent puncture damage and this does aid in water proofing some. At the end of the day getting something water tight is a very long uphill battle. Trying to get something water resistant, however, is very easy. This is something that it sounds like you have done already.

One might consider heat shrinking the phase wires connectiong from ESC to motor if they are exposed to the elements. In your specific case it sounds like a little piece of rubber over that charging port is one of the few things left to do still. Think of what they do to cover the mic/speaker ports on a walkie talkie and try to replicate that perchance? 

If we can get someone to scientifically confirm that the motors wouldnt have a problem all that would be left to do is get @chaka to take one of his ollinboards outside in the rain/sleet/snow. Since his boards encase everything but the motor inside the board itself.... i think that would be a perfect way to test lolololol

just some thoughts...

what i have done is run the phase wires inside the deck, used ESCs that don't need ventilation, and sealed the box with a gasket of some kind. In the past i've even used hot glue with good success to fill in the cracks between the box and the deck. Its the same as using a silicone caulk but without the ridiculous wait time. Hot glue all the gaps around any switches, charge ports or volt meters too. 

You can splash all day with probably most quality motors. Enertion has their motors coated in some sort of water proofing material, but i think most motors are fine being splashed in. I'm using NTM PropDrives right now on my 6S and they can take a puddle just fine. 

Keeping all your connections taped or heat shrinked will go a long way as well should any water eventually get inside the box. 

If you're using a single box design and want to seal it but are using water/dust proof car ESCs with fans, my advice is to partition the box in such a way as to seal the battery and switch electronics away from the car ESCs and do some ventilating in the ESC partition of the box. You'll want to heat shrink your phase and power wires for sure in this case. Get creative with the vents, it can add to your aesthetic.

if you look up RC car waterproofing, basically all of those techniques can be applied to eboards aswell.

yea that is true but look up Jang's video on how to clean a "waterproof rc" water proofing rc methods can be applied to bigger ideas but I would just keep my stuff dry.

I feel like you just shouldnt ride in wet conditions just because you could fall in a muddy puddle and end up looking like shit with a eboard that looks worse

haha flight test is the best- seems like something @longhairedboy would do if he went into the rc airplane hobby instead of discovering eboards. 

 making cinder blocks and microwaves fly are just some of the stupid projects they do..

ok, small rant over: and yes, corrosion x is used on basically all their models, so they definitely stand by the recommendation. My only concern would be how well it would handle all the heat and vibrations from eboards that you don't see as much of in airplanes and quadcopters...

My setup I ride in the rain and it doesn't get too wet. I just don't go into puddles if there's one going up a curb I pick it up and go to the area with less water. Works great though. I'm glad it makes it up a 18-22% incline in the rain! lol

Someone needs to make some slick tires that are good in the rain lol.

Back in high school we always welcomed the rain for the mere fact it made things slick. Burnouts became so easy that even my buddys 78 chevy truck could get the tires to break loose.

Sounds to me like a dual rear drive in the rain would make for some pretty great slides. Maybe even the first ever longobard doughnut? lol

hmm... now I want to try to do donuts, lol.

@lowGuido I love the idea behind those wheels, but there's a cost to it. Less surface area for the torque to be applied to and once the grooves wear down, its no different then other wheels.

I will try them at some point though on a build. Thanks for the links.

i saw this when i was looking at mountain boards!

this would be pretty easy to mod i think. If you could get some hub motors in the ends of those tracks you would literally have a tank. It might need to be jacked up on risers to make room for what obviously needs to be a huge battery pack though. 

somebody please do this. lol

I think hub motors would be perfect for this but the issue is you would need to keep the electronics in a sealed, water proof enclosure, which would be hard since esc's need air flow to cool down. It would be awesome to see though.

why would you ever need to turn? you're on tank treads. Whatever you can't mow down you can crawl over. Trees, houses, small children, alligators, big children, obese people in wheelchairs...

seriously though you'd probably have to run four hub motors and hack all the VESCs to turn using one sided brakes/reverse much like tanks do. Luckily there's a wheel on the GT2B with its own signal channel. HMMMMMMMMMM.........

I think this would be perfect for the winter. I was joking yesterday with my gf that I could strap my snowboard on my back, using the electric snow skateboard to get up the mountains, then switch them and snowboard down... who needs lifts?

Speaking of having fun in the wet and rainy....

Its raining here in San Francisco. I had a pretty wet ride just now and on the way back I managed to find a couple spots of really smooth pavement and sidewalk. Whilst riding over those smooth spots the wetness allowed for me to punch the acceleration and just break the wheels free. I had a whole block of just using burnouts to keep me moving foward lol

Being in Seattle I face a lot of wet. This is my new build for winter, I use silicon mat and rubber and foam rubber to build up deck and seal as a gasket. I made a motor cover from a lens cap and aluminiun water bottle. This is cold weather only as heat is an issue in summer. <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/a/a3f237e3356537460a70f717c51f8e69cc492177.jpg" width="666" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/5/50cbd403c12b51aa7308c3137d3aca806fb0e405.jpg" width="666" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/e/e9e07f78420bb0c75ef9341249b510fa164472df.jpg" width="666" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/a/a3f237e3356537460a70f717c51f8e69cc492177.jpg" width="666" height="500">

@Airlocktechnics nice work! How do you attach the cover to the motor? Do you bolt it to the motor mount or does it spin on the outrunner can? either way it's a cool idea! I used to live in Seattle and yup, it's pretty much wet all the time. Careful for slick roads!

The cap has holes that the mounts screws go through. The cylinder portion then inserts inside of flange of the lens cap. I use some electrical tape around it to make sure it does not slip off. Its easy to slip on and off without removing motor. I use port covers too.

This one looks great for 1mm Silicone just to cover everything.

speaking of silicone, i just received a whole roll of black silicone sheeting to use as gaskets. When I got it i took it out of the box to look at and feel and I think its going to be a real winner when I finally get my boxes ready and need to make gaskets. 

I just tried to dig through my email but i can't find the order confirmation with the link on it. Blast!

However... I took freehand willy apart last night, with everything apart I try and get a test fire to work. The wheels spin up and all is well. So now I have some extra UBEC action for the 3 VESCs I am currently sitting on lol

Also got some hot glue so that I can use that to help keep the water out some. Speaking of hot glue... [longhariedboy's post about hot glue][1]

Which is perfect for some extra waterproffing of my battery box, which wasn't sealing perfectly due to the thickness of my lipo's:

Aftere scalpeling the top off, I now have a perfect secondary seal for those particularly wet days, which also functions as a safety to keep the lid on tight:

I know this thread is ancient, but I have a question.

Im thinking of covering my motor with an aluminum shield similar @Airlocktechnics, but im afraid this will induce eddy currents in the aluminum because of the nearby moving magnets. This will cause the aluminum to heat up and drag on the motor...

Is this a legitimate concern or will I be fine if I leave at least a couple mm clearance?

Should be fine, there is already a steel can around your magnets wich is keeping most of the flux inside.
Anyways brushless motors generally are safe to run in wet conditions.
