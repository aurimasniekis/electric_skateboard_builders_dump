I was browsing through Facebook on my phone the other evening when i saw this in my news feed.

![Screenshot_20181021-084730|281x500](upload://xlN3SEnvXaiXPWY8ZPf5FuJ0nft.jpeg) 

Its an advert for FOCBOX by Enertion.
Nothing unusual about that, I see these often. The thing that caught my eye is that the enclosure in the picture looked oddly familiar, its mine.

So i started wondering how one of my images was appearing alongside an Enertion advert. Initially i thought that i might have uploaded this image to facebook and that some clever AI smarts had recognised the FOCBOX's and linked this to the ad. After some investigation I realised that I have never uploaded this image Facebook(or Instagram) and that it has only been posted to my build thread on this forum. (https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/big-torque-reliable-board-for-the-larger-rider-trampa-street-dual-6374-focbox-custom-battery-enclosure/43075/57?u=ducktaperules)

Then I realised that it might not be just me and that the other "diy" images that im seeing are probably being used without the consent of their builders.

So this leads me to 2 possible conclusions:
 1 - Facebook is taking photos off my phone, tagging them and using them in targeted advertising (somewhat unlikely).
 2 - Enertion is taking pictures from this site and uploading them to facebook to use as advertising without asking or even notifying the original creators.

Anyone know whats going on here?

This site exists purely for enertion's use for SEO and marketing.  That's the reason @onloop won't let the community pay for it.  It's a fair trade -- we get this, they get that.

They stole the firmware for the FOCBOX from Benjamin Vedder, so it's not surprising.

edit: they released it now

upon inspecting the TOS it doesn't seem like they ever bothered to fill this in.

https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/tos

I think this means no one actually has the rights to use these images without consent of the owner.

Well you said this was not a picture that you took yourself, but its your enclosure right? Enertion never did an advert for "your product" even if using the image, once you sell a product people don't need your permission to photograph it. Someone could have taken a picture with focboxes and your enclosure to show off their build and enertion may have just liked the image is my thoughts. That said, I'd take pride that people are showing off your stuff!

Though there is a good way and a bad way to use others' photos whether or not it is actually "required"

I had some Popocas on my Boosted Board back before I had a real ride and @chaka reached out and asked if he could use the image.  He even sent me some cool stuff.

Did he need to?  No.  But it was a damn classy move, and it meant a lot to me.

@Sender i agree. it wouldn't cost them much time just to ask and im sure most people would be flattered that they wanted to use an image. Something like A few % discount code might go a long way in good will.

Its a common thing for facebook to use the content of your phone.  As soon as you upload a pic it asks to have access to the gallery.  That is giving them permission.  Simple.  Same with the mic.  How many times have you been talking about a thing then not 5 mins later that same thing pops up on your feed?
Happens to me all the time.  Bit conspiracy theory I know but try it and see.

Awesome. Clean and concise.

It really is flattering when people use our personal photos for adverts TBH.  But some recognition/acknowledgment is always appreciated.  Be that in private or giving photo credit. 

Props for the honesty and acknowledgment.

Well.  That makes sense in a way but best way to avoid this Stuff like this from happening is.  Do not post pictures unless you’re koo with people “borrowing” them for their own purpose. Heck.  I steal pics from the internet all of the time.   I Go online and when I see something I like or think is koo.   Guess what.   I click save image 😬🤫😂

I mean, you are not wrong.  But, I completely understand the frustration.

It feels as almost you have been commandeered without your knowledge.

I just feel like a little pm saying, "hey awesome photo, we would love to use it in an advertisement" would go a long way.

It is flattering and a recognition of deligence.  You know, we all like to feel a little special 😁😉

That picture says I reviewed it in April, I don't remember that but it was a long time so, so its possible I could have given it 5 stars and forgotten about it. But I definitely never agreed to be in an advert. Can reviews be used in adverts? This is kind of creepy.

Reviews can be used in Adverts I've seen it alot. Now putting your whole name out there is another story. Generally it's First name plus the first letter of your last name to keep you the customer anonymous.

Thanks for admitting this and thanks for the build compliments :slight_smile: 

For the record, i am ok with you using it, i just feel like it would have been nice to be asked or even notified. Seeing my pictures used on a site i have never uploaded them to and advertising a company i have no affiliation with was a bit of a shock. I could imagine that people planning to sell products may have objections to this.

Also, you may want to sort your TOS out.

PS. planning a similar enclosure for my Unity when it arrives :)
