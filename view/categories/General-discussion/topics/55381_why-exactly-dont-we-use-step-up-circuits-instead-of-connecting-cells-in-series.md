So I'm not really sure what the disadvantages of a step up circuit are but I started thinking about this while designing my own 10s4p battery pack

It's less efficient to do it that way.  More chemical energy wasted as heat instead of transformed into mechanical rotation.

What @b264 said is the main reason and another reason could be charging because you will have a pack like 40P and there are not a lot of 4.2v 40-80A chargers
