Hi !

i'm working on [http://esk8builds.com](http://esk8builds.com) a directory where anyone can share their esk8 builds (photo, parts, performance stats, upload esc/vesc-bldc settings)

I know there are some people here working on similar ideas like @evoheyax and @Okami, i took some ideas from them, don't be mad at me, i just want to show my vision and contribuite to esk8 world.

my esk8 builds
http://esk8builds.com/home/?user_id=1

i will appreciate any feedback! :slight_smile:

**some features**

Wow, great job man @tueboard

How much time did you spend creating this?

Did you do this alone?

Design looks quite good.. 

That is a point we never finished, though we had some ideas on how it should look.. (build log view page)

thanks @Okami !

- i did this by myself, the design is bootstrap.
- i've a 75% code from a similar side project.
- i just added some features (upload esc settings, edit performance stats & some info) in about 6 hours more or less.

i saw your post, in my opinion gathering data from ESC to show "Average Wh per mile", etc.. is not usefull as sharing ESC settings to help people to get the same performance results and also it's easer to code because there are a lot of ESC's out there.

**new features**

1- you can attach a youtube url video in your esk8 build

2- instagram account to discover the best builds
[follow esk8builds on instagram](https://www.instagram.com/esk8builds/)

**next steps**

- gather data from all users to give recommendations.

- a section called "improve" to help people to improve specific specs of their boards: speed, range, weight, charge batteries faster..

Feel free to give me your opinion, i will appreciate it!

The website looks clean, feels light and fast. I like minimalistic approach and colors. It also looks good both on the phone and desktop :) Nice work!

I would like to suggest search / filter function as a future improvement. When the database gets larger it will be nice to find all builds with SK3, for example.

This is a great idea. I was literally wishing there was a thread or dedicated website specifically for builds last week, and here it is.

I've already uploaded my build to it. (see if you can guess which one it is based on my username). 
Can I suggest a cost stat for builds? That way if someone wants to do a similar build, they can see what it might cost before they start it.
Also, perhaps an option to upload more than one picture for a build? Sorry if that's already an option, I'm just having a hard time finding it.

@pennyboard done! you can edit the average price in the form inside "Edit stats & info"

@rpasichnyk @Esrapp21 at this moment there are a few items so i put a search box to find buils with some specific part, for example mini remote controller.

Hello, have just got into the realm of longboarding and built my own eboard. I have the VESC a 350kv alien motor and flysky gt3 reciever. I tested it for the first time yesterday. It works ok, but i have the following issues:

(In duty cycle mode and bldc mode)

when I let off the throttle i get an annoying squealing sound and the wheels lock up or feels like a brake is on

when I am on the throttle it is not smooth, it feels like all or nothing, large amount of deadband

to get the board going from a standstill it shakes and feels like it is cogging but once it gets going its ok

if you know what settings in the bldc tool would help with these issues please let me know, thanks!

Hi! Could you add these 2 ''features'':

Enable ''longer stream of builds'' per page.

Also, perhaps it could be made, that pictures are a bit smaller, since each build takes a lot of space.. (though this is personal taste and perhaps with many more boards per page, it will look just great - more details to see)

----

Besides - dont you plan to somehow make a traffic to your page? I believe not that many ppl know about your little esk8 database yet :slight_smile:

Anyways, nice work, as always.. really glad you made something like this possible in such short amount of time :)

---

One more ''issue'' / thing I found interesting:

Is it possible to disable the function to open a new page when the ''LIKE'' button is clicked on? I just noticed that each time you click ''Like'' the browser opens that current board I ''Liked''..
Perhaps it could be another button/icon next to the ''LIKE'' button, which simbolises ''eye'' - to understand that the button will open that current build..
```

ah crap that it did not work out straight away.. I hope we come up with something that will fix this.. 

If there is a viral eboard video, might add the boards description and the link to your site.. 

Im also still learning how this ''user attraction'' on the internet works.. sometimes the things are just way too slow lol

There has to be some sort of reward or benefit in visiting your site and posting the info there..Im just not sure yet what it might be though..Otherwise.. im not sure how else can you drive traffic to your page..

So far it looks quite ok to me and it seems like you can handle a few fixes / improvements to the page, if they are needed, in a timely manner :) So I think it should not be the cause.. that the page is not enough finished yet or something.. not to post the info there :)

--

I actually thought that the best way would be to ''fill it automatically''.. but this internet/coding stuff is a bit too hard for me.. and im not sure how will you take some or most of the ''forum builds'' and then ''output'' them to your database..

If you could somehow come up with an ''algorithm'' that can read a webpage, search for keywords and then copy that relevant info, then it would be quite nice.. :D 

Then another user would re-edit what the program gathered and publish it as build :slight_smile:

Sorry for my imagination.. but that''s just the scenario I can imagine how to improve the manual work of entering info there.. especially if the info is not inserted by the builder itself but by a 3rd person

So if nothing like this exists yet / already it is probably not worth it to code it.. same old manual labor would suffice to fill it up by 10-20 builds this way.. ppl just have to agree that such a person ''collects their build info'' then shows it to the builder (the compiled version) and then publishes on your site!

--

This is actually a good resource to look at how handy is to see the different board pictures.. this way it is very easy to quickly distinguish what is interesting and look-taking worthy..:

customer-builds/

So, in comparison, I think your page rocks! I even had to spend about 20seconds or more to find where the ''customer builds'' section is located.. (ended up searching for it, since I knew it existed)

---

One comment - im not sure how they ''make'' the ppl to post the info there, but so far it looks like they have succeeded quite ok.. I dont know do they offer a discount or what but for some reason there are reasonably big assortment of boards, if you ask me :)
```

the idea of reading a web to import builds automatically is not bad, but it's hard to implement it because there is not a "standard" way to publish/read a esk8 build.

i wrote to some users here to publish their builds and some did it but i feel a little bit spammy,
maybe the best way to get content right now is to ask people for permission to publish their builds and do it by myself...

so if someone wants to share their esk8 build (photo and parts) i will appreciate it !

It looks quite nice. I have some ideas:
- Would be nice if the user could upload more than one picture
- add a delete button
- make a popup for the pciture instead of showing the raw picture

keep up the good work :thumbsup:

EDIT: I just checked many builds and none had multiple pictures. now i see that you already have it. so forget idea 1 :D

Ok checked the results.. i noticed that the penny board's picture looks quite ok! you can see all of the board.. but the rest of the boards is barely visible.. this somewhat limits the use of the picture.. 

I think (if it is still possible) it was best to keep the previous picture size but just improve the count of builds per one page.. 

sorry for that but I feared it might happen if the picture size is reduced.. so yes, previous size was okay, as it allowed to see boards in great detaill.. now it is hard to do that for all the builds.. I wont be able to suggest what size to keep/make, so just perhaps stick with the big pictures and once there will be a lot of builds it will be up to the users to look through all of them :)

Hey I got a better idea - why dont you do how ''deathcookies'' said - create a ''pop up'' picture.. which is a ''thumbpreview'' for the big picture.. Do you think you can do this?

This way we will keep board count per one picture.. **but if people will want to take a better picture, they will be able to just ''hover'' their mouse over, to see the picture! Without opening the link!**

Take a look.. some pictures are ''cut down in size''.. and you dont get to see enough of the board!

ESK8.de and that penny board I think are the only ones who get ''good exposure'' (+duffmans 4wd board).. Yours too maybe, as its battery box's picture is quite in the center !

Hey, hi once again @tueboard

Is it possible to change profile picture for existing builds? I found how to edit stats but not how to replace the existing picture.. otherwise i find it troublesome to create a new build and enter every data once again, if only the looks are different :\

Also.. some more options to view the boards in main view would be nice.. is it possible to include a button to switch between 'layout' of how the board pictures look?

To be honest.. still sad the page hasnt caught on.. I found one guy who made a really nice tut on how he made his.. that im sad to see not more builds have been collected on your awesome website..

Cheers, Okami

@okami good idea, i've to allow to upload a gallery of a build and let choose one photo as the main thumbnail, delete, etc...

about changing the layout, are you talking about doing something like pinterest.com?

some ideas in my head:
- filters (eboard type street - mountainboard, price range)
- allow to put a name
- also i want to add builds from this forum and then i can put a button "claim my eboard" to allow people to get permissions of their eboards to change the settings..

@darkkevind yes, thats a bug, thanks to notify it and BTW cool eboard :)

will reply a bit more later.. but what i thought was a way to go from full size image to these 'thumbnails' we are having now.. i really like the thumbnail view but it still looks like some builds might be 'cut out' due to the actual board being at the lower part of the image (you can see this for some builds like my small tire board)

Otherwise.. very nice ideas what you mention.

----

im not sure whenever this 'full size image view' is fully needed but i thought that some people might enjoy to scroll through the large images of different builds and see them completely... otherwise it is okay as it is now - with thumbnail.. just the little 'annoyance' i mentioned, that for some builds it might be that they cannot be seen, due to location of the board / its position in image.. only way around this might be to offer preview window before posting.. so that user can decide how his board will look on main page, while in 'thumbnail''/ small image view

So yeh.. this is a thing to decide.. not sure is it worthy to implement it but i thought to mention it in case there is a quick fix or a workaround in your mind that might solve this or improve this.. // otherwise the rest of the ideas you mentioned might be more worthy to implement and make active :) 

Otherwise I really like how the 'popup' image thing works now.. maybe im just in too much details  right now and it is not that important for a keen looker at builds

**important**

upload the photo is the easy part, the tedious part is to add all the components (esc, deck, wheels, motors...) and all the specs, i know this sucks a lot, but i prefer less boards with all the information as possible rather than just the photo, [see an example](http://esk8builds.com/photo/view/?id=20). (i moderate the results to show only the boards with all the information)


special thanks to @Okami to pushing me to improve the website.

Good improvement, now it is possible to change the picture easily or add more pictures!

What I thought about while editing some stats.. is this:

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/2/3/23c4eec2515e5cbb148dd902c4a5a956f56a50e2.png" width="690" height="195">

Maybe in future (if you got time and willingness) there could be some sort of filter or indicator which boards are the fastest / most heavy / light or long range / short range.

**Speed**

U would probably need to create 3 or so categories for each 'criteria' in each category.. something like:

Fast: over 50kmh / 30mph in speed, 
Quite Fast: over 40 km / 25mph 
Moderately Fast: over 30kph / 20mph

**Range**

Then for battery specs the same, though it would probably depend on what wheel type has been choosen.

AT wheels: 

Short range: Less than 15km 
Good range = More than 15km (less than 30km)
Great / incredible range: more than 30km  

Street wheels: (similar specs?)

**Weight of board:**

+10kg = Heavy
+8kg = Modereately heavy
below 8kg, light

----

All of this is of course subjective and 'criteria' might change/ evolve over time, but I find it as something interesting, if there were these 'positions' for each board next to the stats or maybe in the filter tool, too!..

@Okami thanks for the idea, i added more filters and changed a little bit the homepage design

@mmaner wow thanks! for uploading more builds with all the information

also i added a lightbox effect in the gallery, to zoom in the photos without open a new tab.

I really like the new lightbox and filtering capabilities.  Te coolest thing about your webapp is that you can look at many builds all at once and see the gear list required to build, really gives you a method of evaluating different types of builds..  I dont think its really needed as there is an 'other' option but you might consider adding a 'risers' option.

Something looks like is wrong with 'mph' formula, when showing main page:

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/d/0/d07f15ad65ea21fe3e2bdef9685d8c8d246f6870.png" width="567" height="223">

When opening the board, it shows the correct speed in mph.. I saw the same 'glitch' for a few others boards.

--

Otherwise, heads up to @mmaner for posting your builds.. they do look real nice / in different light when compiled in one page with all the stats on hand :)..

@tueboard didnt get to see the 'lights off' effect yet but I see that due to stats, the thumbpreview function does not work anymore, right?

yeh i got it now.. didnt click on image while I was in gallery.. 

Uh I hate this one thing with programming / modifying anything, that once you 'open it' , that after it a vast ocean of other things to do and improve arise (become clear).

--
When talking about filters, I sort of think that maybe they should be 'collapsable'· That you need to click on the icon of speed / range / etc, to open the sorting menus for it.. but it might be just my perception / view, that it would look better this way.

If I will see anything else I will add it here.. im sure there is more and im thankful @tueboard u find the time to make these changes and improve the page ;) :)

PS, this is a very nice view about each users board inventory :slight_smile: Would be cool, if each one of us had a link for it in our profiles here on forum :D

yep, it does look good now!

One other thing I spotted:

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/c/e/cefac7e380bfc1dc0a21db2da617b3bab553cbf8.png" width="690" height="278">

I know it might not be possible to tell if picture has white background or black background at top left corner, but is it possible to sort of add 'opaque' window for the stats?..

Preview to make the impression: 

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/5/c/5c4dffa1843235cbc6c59fe105bbfc1a0ce18093.png" width="355" height="355">

I think if you did create a semi transparent box for the stats / text it might look better on some pictures, where the background is really white.. this is also one of the things which caught my eye early on but i didnt want to ruin everything by pointing towards it.. 

Also I partly think it might be better for the overall style that the stats are in sort of a box window and not just 'printed' onto the picture.. tell me what you think :)

It might cover part of the picture.. but shouldnt ruin it completely .. that is also why I would like that window is transparent but still visible.. sort of like a bit of barrier between stats and picture

A lot of things now look good..  I wonder what else do we need now for people to finally start go there and publish some of their builds lol..

As a side note - when u got more time to do some things.. it might be cool, if viewers wouldnt need to click on 'Photos' button / link but had little thumbpreviews under the main picture.. is this possible or that requires too much effort?

adding parts of your build is the most boring part, so now its a little bit easier, when you choose a part category you will get some suggestions below, you only have to choose one to add it without write nothing

also you can filter builds by budget

**do you have an esk8 web-shop?**

if you want to get some promotion you can put a link of each part of your board to your web-shop as they do:

- [esk8.de](http://esk8builds.com/home/?user_id=5)

- [psychotiller](http://esk8builds.com/home/?user_id=7)

Bit of feedback (great site by the way from a fellow developer)...

Just went to 'like' a build not realising I wasn't logged in, within the photo window it shows the login screen, I guess because it posts to your action and it's not authenticated so returns the login screen in the view/html returned from the post.

On some of my sites, when that happens on the client side I check for a unique string in the login HTML then grab the current url + query string and location.href to the login page... that way they come back by means of the ReturnUrl.....

**Stats about total build count?**

Anyways.. nice to see the progress with the page.. Would be interesting to see some overall stats about the page, can you @tueboard make some small stats window, so see how many builds are there already? I think similar principle was used in www.evalbum.com page (total builds on site)

**On a side note** - 

I Found new shop to perhaps add to the list, someone said they offer Vesc-X in europe + a few other esk8 parts.

 46 Filtered results     
• 45 Total eboards

Can you put these on the left side and with bigger letters / fonts?

(Otherwise I couldnt find it for a couple of seconds hah. would be cool if it was 2-3 second till someone sees it on the page :slight_smile:

Though I get your idea about filtered results showing on the right side ;) (

//total build icon maybe can be just 'numbers' ? No text.. maybe a small icon (of a board or something)

@okami as always thank you for your feedback, but im not sure about this, i changed the text "total eboards" to bold.  about the board icon maybe not everybody will understand. 


**new filters!**

maybe the results are not very accurate at all, i've to change some product names, for example if some deck has some flex, the deck name needs to have the word "flex".

Nice idea., btw why did u remove the esk8 parts shops from your page? 

I liked how easy it was to access certain shops / links through your page, im not sure how many other sites have the esk8 parts shops listed in one place. Was a handy feature, in my opinion.

 If there was an option to somewhat add rating or comment about each shop, it could have been even more awesome and i partly think.that more people could have used your page just to access the shops itself..

So yeh i suppose u had your reason to remove it but if u planning to put it back to your page that would be nice

I will give some more shop links when at computer, if u got the link would be nice to add ultimate vesc remote shop.. so that it is there

Edit, here is the link:
http://www.eboardshop.net/

Might be cool, to add filter tool for 18650 for nkon site:

http://kevindark.co.uk/PublicServices/NkonFilter

If you're interested, maybe in future there could be small section for just other esk8 related things? I remember a while ago u also had a link for esk8 calculator.. that is, if a new user goes there and didnt know such thing existed.

One such link could be Nkon Filter tool then, added to this 'Esk8 Resources Part' ;)

Hi! What was with the screen you shared in picture thread @tueboard ?

Actually I got a nice idea out of it - I know there are bicycle people who log their rides with one specific gps app and at the end of season, they sort of 'nominate' the riders with most distance ridden.

Maybe something similar could come up for esk8. Sort of seems like this is something @ squishy654 might be interested in, as he seems to be the long distance guy (especially in one single continous ride)

little update!

there are almost 100 eboards on esk8builds and its a little bit hard to find the boards of someone, so you can use the search input to find usernames, like "etoxx"

new update! if your eboard has the option to swap between street and all terrain wheels you can indicate that in "edit info"

you can find all this boards using the filter

Add your builds peoples. And for the ones that have already check your build and add any missing info please.

thanks sayekim!

i didnt touch the website for months, just sometimes i've to approve the new boards.

thanks @okami message and your comment gave me some motivation to make some improvement on the site, now if you put the cursor over the photo you cant see the photo without the board information and also you can see an icon to see the photo in full size.

![hover|690x262](upload://d9GPQWijIddIobviaGAkTTJOKq5.jpeg) 

the most difficult thing about this website are:

1- some people just upload the photo, but dont complete all the board info like parts and specs.

2- get more boards.

i dont like to spam too much here

thanks
