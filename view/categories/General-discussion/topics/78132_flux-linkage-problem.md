Plug it into the computer and try it with the arrow keys. 

Have you set the throttle range on the nano x. As in full throttle then brake?

The adjusted of the ppm should be one of the reasons why it’s so less power output, but did you here the sound of the motors.
Maybe it’s just me, but it doesn’t sound healthy.
