Quick quesadilla for ya‚Äôll, how do you build? How do you hydrate, what music do you listen to?

LHB undoubtedly rocks some hair metal, maybe a whisky or wine drinker ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è, not entirely sure how Florida breeds it‚Äôs warriors.

I get down to business In the go fast lab with a mix of alt rock 90s/trendy modern fast stuff. Tito‚Äôs vodka keeps me motivated.

Probably boarding but I enjoy silence and focus on the things I do. I have a lot of noice around me all day. Sitting in my room working on my boards make me relaxe.

Ok ok on good days i add some Bonobo chill beats or good old 90s German hip hop üòÖ

I always blast shitty pop music and set the lights to go rainbow, if I'm not sufficiently distracted then I get too picky

Also lots of illegal soldering in building lounges with friends...makes the pain and monotony more bearable

I work next to my bed on my desk. It's a small workspace but I make it work. Mostly listen to 80's-90's alt rock and smoke, I only drink socially.

I solder/weld/drill in my bedroom. A shop-vac does wonders in the smallest of spaces. For music, some mix of classical and some Iron Maiden keeps me company. This pop up table has been through things... ![image|666x500](upload://pjTWwdIfKLZRmkVl552yr5Yp6qN.jpeg)

I set up my laptop and play tv episodes i have seen before. That way i can listen but still remember the scenes. I can't watch anything new or i will have to focus on it and work too slowly.

If I have new movies on and listen only, I feel like a psychic when I watch it it later. I usually forget, and it‚Äôs the weirdest deja Vu till I remember id heard it before.

For the hot months, I pack up my car with some stuff after work, do the usually dinner and family time. Family goes to bed around 11:00pm. I drive back to the office and use the conference room and the six empty cubes at my disposal. Great lighting, lots of room and A/C. Clean up is a bitch though. But it‚Äôs better than being attacked by mosquitoes

Do you ever have meetings and find telltale solder flash on table or floor and try to casually brush it aside üò¨üòÇ

The dining room aka the lab, always a mess, but I clear enough space to work on things in here.  Typically drinking tea or coffee while working and smoke breaks.

Hah yah thought I was having deja vu thanks for clearing that up.  If I were to pick a drink would either be Jack and Coke or White Russians (basically liquid candy with some liquor)

Do you also listen to polite elevator music here to? üòÇ Jkjk

Edit: not a knock, maybe I‚Äôm not clear, looks very professional, almost too professional. Like you might have a lobby and a receptionist. #buildergoals

The video was kinda cute actually, you can feel the guy loves his wife haha

And btw I love working on my living room's floor and table. Maybe knowing I can't drop stuff from the ground feels reassuring.
