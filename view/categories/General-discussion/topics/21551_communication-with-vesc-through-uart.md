Hello,

I am developing a new Esk8 system that will have many useful features both with the remote and and on board PCB and I'd like to use the UART communication to control the motors so I just wanted to ask:

1) what is the format of the protocol for example: my one goes like that ATTN then addres < Data>
so if I would write it it'd look something like that to set motor speed to 100 ATTNMSpeed<100>
2) I see there is an arduino library for that but I don't know the values of the current range 
3) Do I have to set motor current to 0 before applying brake current or it does that automatically?

Thanks for your time.
