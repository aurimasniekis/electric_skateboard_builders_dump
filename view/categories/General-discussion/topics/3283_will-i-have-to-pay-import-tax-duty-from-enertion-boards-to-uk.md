Yes,  and the rate is pretty high, 75 gbp for a 290 gbp order, a good 25%, crazy? No, UK :) 
And if for some reason parcelforce is delivering the package, add other 13 pounds. I ordered a deck from china and it costed me almost double. 

Still, I am very happy with enertion stuff (rspec+ kit) and I ordered another time to get another VESC and new pulleys + spaced trucks (because I got the old kit for some reason, that should be stronger )  and probably will order again (dual motor mounts,. pulleys 13/36t and motors) at some point maybe.

VAT at 20%, duty is about 3% plus a clearance fee of about £30 is average
