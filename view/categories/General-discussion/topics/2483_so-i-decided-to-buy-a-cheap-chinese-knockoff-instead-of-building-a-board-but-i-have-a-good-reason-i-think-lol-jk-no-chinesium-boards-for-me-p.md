So I decided to buy a [lectric longboard,](http://www.lectriclongboards.com/#!product-page/iky07/f2cc0138-25f2-8c27-9bda-16ffaf5b9f2b) mainly because I wanted the cheapest entry point into esk8 to make sure it is something that will actually be viable for what I want to use it for (getting to/from work). I also figured that if/when something breaks on it (motor, esc, battery?) then I can just replace it with a higher end part, while still keeping it in the nice enclosure that it comes with.

Does this sound like a completely idiotic idea? or only slightly idiotic? 

From the math I did on part picking from enertion/diyelectricskateboard it didn't seem possible to get all the parts I need to build one for under $400 with similar specs (20mph, 15-18 mile range), am I wrong on that?

You are correct, if you want a similar setup you will need a few hundred dollars more than that for quality stuff.

But that's the deal breaker, quality. 

Your idea is not idiotic many people do that with the E-go board. But I think it's a lot harder than it seems to just swap out DIY parts on a manufactured good.

@Karmannghiagirl I don't think it's idiotic. Especially if you realize, up front, that you'll need to replace it if you fall in love with riding electric.

If it lasts year and you get to enjoy riding right away for a price you can afford, go for it. I obviously love building my own esk8s, and I appreciate the added quality that goes along with DIY, but it's not *always* the best solution for all circumstances.

Two things: you might not be able to salvage very much from this purchase, and I'm going to guess that the listed specs might not deliver exactly as promised. But you might get 12-15 mph and 8-10 miles, which is pretty good for starting out.

@Karmannghiagirl I don't know if anyone here has bought a Chinese board and then upgraded it later on. Could be a whole new market out there for upgrade parts designed for these Chinese boards. If they produce a ton of these, i'm guessing they are and that's why the price is so low, then there are going to be a lot of those rolling around. I would like to see a hot rodded version of the Chinese boards. Could be a great introduction to ESK8 for a lot of people. :v:

made by a local singapore country . dont ask me details . i am only sharing . all i know is that a singapore company is selling it for only SGD$699 = USD$519.99 . at 3.5kg (compared to mine 7kg) ; its a steal .

and the remote is practical .

[quote="Karmannghiagirl, post:1, topic:2483"]
am I wrong on that?
[/quote]

you're not wrong by that statement .

look at it this way for i speak out of my experience .
you need an eboard . and for USD $399 . its a STEAL . true . i'm guessing you're living in U.S.A . the more reason for you . if you have purchase it .congrats .

through my experience , i first bought mine a single motor eboard . after 9 months of work ~ home usage , the belt snaps . luckily it was at slow speed . and it wasnt downhill another thanks to GOD . 
then i got my self DIYelectricskateboard  dual diagonal full setup for USD$850 roughly . still using it til today . 
i can program and re~program the  Electronic Speed Controller to the way i want . faster ? slower ? unlike the Ready~To~Ride out of the box Eboards you were mentioning , i have TWO belts now . if ONE were to SNAPPED at any given time not stated in any brochures , at least i have the other ONE for braking . and TWO awesome MOTORS are worth it .
so , comparing my DIY Dual Diagonal with a dual motor of Boosted ? 
i'd say mine is waaaay Freaking Awesome ; ) than Boosted ~ in TWO WAYS .

1) Boosted Dual is USD$1499                                                    while mine is only USD$850

2) Boosted Dual is fixed !   means that it is factory issued deck   while mine is any of my desired choice 

if compare price with your choice ~ then you win .

it is just a choice we make in our daily live . i wish you happy carving as i do to all e~boarders , skaters or whatever we call ourselves . just remember to wear safety gear . never compromise safety . we have only one of each God~given bones in our body .

this website has no stock, they have no track record, it's literally a [college student](http://www.lectriclongboards.com/#!our-story/nbiaf) who decide to make a website and collect people's money without doing any work....

he is going to give all your money to this guy: http://helloskate.en.alibaba.com/ & hope that the products get made to a good standard, which they won't.

the guy who runs this Chinese company is Randy, he doesn't give a fuck about you or your $399 electric skateboard... 

there will be no warranty or support....

Levi, The guy who takes your $399 probably makes about $100 profit if he reaches he's sales target, minus some website hosting & advertising fees.... If he's doesn't reach his target the entire deal could crumble... 

he's business will most likely fail within 12 months as he won't be able to service his customers, they will get angry & annoyed... Levi will close the doors & walk away

and no! he won't dyno test them.

& yes you will be disappointed.

... build and eboard and support the scene.

Your not wrong at all! Only problem in my opinion is the fact that you might get sick of the board rather quickly because only reaching a max speed of 19mph gets old VERY quick. Unless you dont mind going slow/crusing all the time, then thats your go to. But if u want to keep the thrill alive, diy is highly recommended because you can always get a higher voltage/higher speed/longer range for a couple extra $$$ yuhhhh digg what im sayinnnn?

Just want to clarify, I am not a thrill seeker, I don't mind going slow, just want something that I can use to get to work and back.

I know exactly what is going on, I have no delusions that they are doing anything besides being a middle man. I also know though, that that is the cheapest price I have found for an esk8 basically anywhere (I don't want to deal with alibaba). I don't expect them to dyno it, it's a mass produced $400 piece of shit board, it's not being sold as a $1,400 [performance board](http://www.enertionboards.com/complete-electric-skateboard/raptor-mono-electric-skateboard/) . I don't expect service, I want this as a base board that I can fuck around with and hack into something halfway decent.

I am trying to get into this on a budget, I don't have a ton of money **right now** that I can throw around to "support the scene". But if you read my post, you would see that I said

[/quote]
AKA "support the scene" after I know this is something I want to put money into, and I can save up for.

I see this as something like massdrop, a big group buy, to get a good price on something, with the middleman making some money on it also.

P.S. They have empirical video evidence showing it working, so why shouldn't i trust them  ;)

Doesn't matter, like I said above, I am fully expecting it to be a piece of shit so when it is possibly slightly better, I will be pleasantly surprised :)

Also, they shot the video on the U of MN campus which I live by, so there is a possibility I could meet up with one of them and see the board before I get it.

Final note: this is probably one of the most common boards that I have seen, the more places I look, the more companies are selling rebranded versions of it. So there has to be something at least halfway decent about it.

sk3 6374 149kv: $50 (a 200-250kv motor would be much faster on this setup though)
fvt120a: $50
GT2B: $25 
Accucell 50w Charger and Power Supply: $45

Caliber Trucks: $50
Flywheel Clones: $20
Torqueboard's drive kit: $128
two multistar 3s 5200mah lipos: $34

Thanks for the thought :slight_smile: he contacted me before posting that and I declined, I like the look of what I ordered (its much slimmer) and I don't want a dual rear drive as I want this as a long range commuter board, which is easier with one motor.

Thanks for the info, but thinking about it (and how shit i am at following through with projects sometimes). I think I am still going to go with the board i ordered. While i could order all those parts, it would be almost $100 more, and I would still have to assemble/mount it myself, which I can guarantee would be hacked together and not look that great `:/`

Lectric is kind of dodgy on instagram. I publicly asked them for specs and at first they responded with marketing gibberish, then they sort of answered my question, then when i pressed for more i was told that this was a fan account and not associated with Lectric. 

I fully expect to see naked barely legal women rubbed in oil standing on their boards next because that's what people do when trying to sell stuff to the young male demographic when they know its not going to end well.

Hopefully that board is hackable, and i totally want to see the guts, so hopefully you'll get it soon and we can see what's going on in there!

anyways:

This is their instagram that is linked from their website: https://www.instagram.com/lectriclongboards/
And this is a fan one that some idiot named almost exactly the same: https://www.instagram.com/lectric_longboards/

I have emailed them with a couple questions and they are usually quick to respond.

Sent them this on the 19th:
> Isn't this just a copy/rebranded version of this board: http://www.melonboard.com/#!product-page/jis7r/975bc5ac-c45f-f81c-fd5c-c909f20d89fa

Got this reply the next day:
> We basically took what they had and then improved it. We increased the speed, motherboard, motor, and braking system. Looks the same externally, but the internals is now a whole new story with this board.

Sent them another question about specs, so it will be interesting to see if/how they respond

Well I think you have all helped to sway me. The more i thought about it, the bigger the knot in my stomach got about the board. So i just sent them an email to cancel my order and I think I am going back to looking at the DIY route.

P.S. @onloop @torqueboards and any other people selling DIY eks8 stuff. If you put together a full entry level package (motor, controller, mount, batteries, etc) to convert a longboard, and were able to price it around $300-400 I have a feeling it would sell very well...

Yeah man LiPo is fine, and prismatic pouches offer a lot of flexibility. I've been running them for a couple years now. 

Its when you mix them with shit electronics and/or don't provide adequate physical or electrical protections to them that they present a problem. And we all know the same damn thing happens with li-ion 18650s. Just because they come in a can doesn't make them less likely to fall prey to shit installations, they just direct their fire toward the caps like a pipe bomb and are less puncture prone. 

I had a lengthy conversation with a gentleman at UL about them, these hoverboard fires, and the fact that some of those jerks were falsely claiming UL status and using their mark without permission.

I'm glad you chose the diy route. The truth is, a lot of those china boards can't be upgrade one piece at a time. Your esc blows, you might not find an esc that fits the job (or the space requirements) that would classify it as an upgrade. You blow a motor, you may have to stick with a small motor that will blow again because the motor mount wasn't designed for larger motors.

Basically, I would equate this idea to that of a government saying "we don't have enough money to build this bridge using concrete and steel, we'll just make it out of wood". If the circumstances are right (its a small bridge, for people only, with suspension), it might work for a while. But what your talking about is driving a car on it. And that bridge won't last long before it breaks.

15+ miles means your going to do some serious commuting with this board. Its not a toy to get you 2 blocks to the corner store.

The false economy @Karmannghiagirl is something almost everyone on here has fallen into. You buy whats the cheapest possible, and think it will work. Even if you expect to replace parts, how often do you expect to keep replacing parts? You may be stuck replacing the motor with another shitty motor, because the motor mount can't fit a larger motor. At the end of the day, you may spend $400 on the board + $50 for a new motor + $50 for an esc + $100 for a new battery and still have a board that will easily break again. This is the false economy, and with eboards, very little details can mess up expensive parts. A splash of water, a pothole, user error (to a small degree), hard braking or acceleration, ect. these issues don't break a good board. But with cheap parts, they will brake.

At the end of the day, your talking about long commutes. I commute 10 miles per day, and it really does take a toll on your board. My first board lasted less than a mile, new esc and new motor, maybe 1000 miles. On to my third build, 200 miles so far, and I'm expecting the motors and escs to last at least 5000 miles, batteries much less than that. But I can't say that about every motor or esc. Certain motors which are heavily recommended on this forum (i.e sk3 for one) seem to hold up. But splurge, spend $600 on a board that will last you more than a year, instead of $400 on a board that may not last more than a few trips.

Also, be wary of an max range numbers. Its like the mpg rating of cars, its usually bs. It all depends on hills, how fast you accelerate, are you accelerating as you approach a stop sign just to have to stop., and road conditions, just to name a few factors. I'm telling you from experience, 1000 mAh = about 1 mile give or take. I had a 16000 mAh battery before, and got about 15-20 miles of range. Now on the space cell (which correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe its around 5000 mAh) and I get about 5 miles of range. If I were you, I would be aiming for 20000 mAh if you really want a 20 mile range. And those size of batteries, even with cheap lipos in parallel, will set you back $200+.

Wouldn't it be more accurate to measure range with watt hours? 10-12s would probably get you more than a mile per amp hour, due to less amps and heat.

it's better to talk about watt hours. The general consensus is 10wh = 1km (0.6 miles) However this average was mostly before people had hub motors on their rigs.

Hub motors are a different beast all together & there is no consensus _yet_ on the average power consumption, I would say at this point they might be half as efficient as a satellite configuration... especially if they are not operating at optimum RPM.

the space cell is a 7500mah battery at 36v nominal so 270wh.

Hi @mostwanted, thanks for the post, we really appreciate the exposure.

Apologies for the late response, but we only recently noticed some traffic coming to our site from this forum. We won't be here to sell the Arc Board, but we would be happy to answer any questions anybody may have about it. 

Just some clarifications we would like to make: The Arc Board is not "just another chinese eboard". Our 3-man team is based on the sunny island of Singapore (South East Asia), and the Arc Board was designed and produced in Singapore. We have spent the better part of the last year and a half working the Arc Board, building it up from a very rough prototype into the (almost) finished product that it is now. 

We have alot of pride in our work and we hope you understand that we would want to clarify this point. There are many cheap alternatives to electric skateboards in the market, but we believe the Arc Board would prove to be more reliable, and more spec-ed out comparatively.

The intention of the Arc Board was to explore the possibilities of building the smallest, lightest, yet still practical electric skateboard, something we ourselves could use as a daily commute, as part of the larger last mile solution. Every part of the board has been laboured over, balancing getting the best results within the limitations of space on the board.

On price, right now the Arc Board is going for SGD$699, and at that price point we are not exactly making a profit off the boards we sell. We are currently in the beta testing phase to refine and iterate quickly on the board to make it better through crowd-sourced feedback. Sure we could raise the price to match what Boosted and Evolve are asking for, but that would go against our belief to make electric mobility accessible to everybody. We are doing our best to bring costs down so the business can be sustainable, but we are not ruling out the possibility that we may have to raise the price eventually.

Lastly, as part of our beta testing process, we would appreciate feedback on the Arc Board, so if there are any questions or comments with regards to the Board, do let us know, we will be more than happy to take questions and comments!

Hi, I know its a bit late but meh. I bought a lectric longboard in may. After about 3 months because of delays such as battery inspections and chinese shipping etc it finally arrived. It was great. I was able to go a max speed of 25ish mph(phone app) on flat ground (i'm 170lbs) and about 15ish miles before it pooped out on me. I had no prior skateboarding experience, but was able to pick it up within 5 minutes on the longboard. I ride it 4 miles to and from school every day. The belt that came with it was defective and broke within the first week, but I emailed them and they sent me a new one (I also bought more online). Levi so far has been really responsive and very helpful with defective products. Apparently he even sent a new deck to some kid that got his run over. I was going to build one but decided it wasn't worth the trouble. Overall 8/10 on the board (coming from someone with no experience) I would recommend it to anyone who is cheap and too lazy to build their own. I ended up spending a total of $440 for the board including shipping & tax

I'm looking at the Lectric Longboards myself.  It seems like you can eventually upgrade to a vesc and those trucks look like the would fit some enertion mounts and motors. I really think it might be cool to buy it and upgrade as you go along. I know not that many people have done this but i think it could work out pretty well.  You could buy the board and swap in the vesc and an enertion moter for $199, that still puts the board at a pretty cheap price point. Idk. I'd like to hear more from people that own these boards and have done some repairs, maintenance or improvements to them.

My bro and I got lectric boards recently. Theyre $500 now, plus $25 shipping. They definitely reach just over 20mph and close to 20 miles range as stated (around 50-80% throttle, closer to 10 miles full speed). 
Support seems helpful, though you dont ever want to have to send the board back for repairs since they make you pay return shipping, which is $40+ (from nyc at least). 

My board had an issue with the bms in the first week so I'm trying to work the board without it by changing the wiring a bit and charging it externally. My bro's is still working well. I got unlucky but chances are nothing like this will happen to you.

They offer a 6 month warranty but honestly you could probably fix most of this stuff on your own. 20mph is great for commuting in cities, and you could always add another 6s battery +modify the casing a bit for extended range. 

There's a guy on youtube who has multiple of these "chinese clone" boards who modifies them and is always saying how great they are for starting off with getting into diy. These boards are very easy to open up and tamper with. He has many videos explaining how to do various upgrades and whatnot which I've found to be extremely helpful.

I was thinking the same thing but I need advice, I’m doing systems engineering at school and I need a project on a budget. Do youse think that if I buy a cheap knock off board 

https://m.ebay.com.au/itm/250W-Wireless-Electric-Powered-Skateboard-4-Wheels-Longboard-W-Remote-Control/312057892219?hash=item48a8198d7b:g:Z7MAAOSwXzNacwH1

That I’ll be able to replace it with quality parts ? Or I’m a better off making one from scratch?

Thanks ✨

Just get a meepo. The motor is way stronger the battery is bigger.  That or go the DIYEboard route and build yourself a belt setup.

Okay thank you, I’m looking at one with a smaller battery becuase I’m looking to transfer it onto a smaller board to make it more portable 👍
