Hello everyone,

Are you or do you know someone who is buying good quality batteries from China? The reason I want to know this is because I am in china but in taobao I feel I can't trust what they advertise and I more likely to pay the real price for a fake model.

If someone knows some legit companies please comment here :slight_smile:

I am looking for x50 Samsung 30Q, LG Hg2 or something similar or better. I don't mind buying a Chinese battery as long as you guys tested it already and say it is good quality. 

I have a dual 6374 so I will need some juice capability.

Aliexpress store name liitokala. they have tons lithium battery orders and also have a good reviews. You can check youtube the batteries reviews. Some people will say its generic not the original and others will say its legit. The best way to answer your question? do a tons of research and reading. I just realized going cheap on battery not worth it burning my house!

I had a board catch on fire from a battery issue. If you choose cheap cells you might as well set 20 $100 bills on fire

LiitoKala sells fake cells... just filter the reviews to 1 stars and you'll see the amount of people receiving fake 30q cells that can only do 10a continuous

Guys I don't want to buy cheap cells, I want to know who sells good sells in China because I am in China. I know all that, thats why I am creating this post :smiley:

I am only afraid of trying to buy the original cells for a expensive price and at the end still get a fake one.

i've bought 45 x 26650 cells from Liitokala for a build.
https://nl.aliexpress.com/item/HK-LiitoKala-Lii-50A-3-7-v-26650-5000-mah-Hoge-Capaciteit-26650-50A-Li-Ion/32856135898.html?spm=a2g0s.9042311.0.0.2a9e4c4dsGA94r
They arrived just fine, very well packed and capacity of more then 5000mAh just like they should be.
They also tested on Lygte and perform good, so they are no crap.
I'm sure this shop on alliexpress has samsung 30Q cells and I've seen video's on youtube that they are just the same.
Maybe you should go for VCT6 if you can get them cheap?

There's been a few threads recently with people in China struggling to get parts, seems crazy but makes sense. Here we all are in the West desperate to get parts from China :slight_smile:

got once hg2 cells from them too.
they had the right capacity, but they all had also the same serial number...
which seems for me a bit strange. Who knows which drain they can stand.
I luckily just ordered 20, which I will use now for powerbanks etc.

Some items are straight forward but others are easily faked like battery for example. Other stuff like motor mounts, trucks, wheels are easy to find and cheap.

OK.

I know for sure of one since I have used them once, but the rest I am just assuming but considering their reputation on Alibaba I guess they wouldn't be selling fakes

About a year ago someone recommended these guys: https://qiso.en.alibaba.com/

I bookmarked the URL but I haven’t used them, so I can’t say if their batteries are legit.

It is legit, it is around 300-500€ here but the range is not so god because battery pack is smaller.

Also not so quick acceleration, I want to build a board that can also change to all terrain, if not, if I was looking for simplicity, short distance fun I would go with that one.

To the people who keep recommending LiitoKala, please take a look a look at this flashlight forum thread where people have been receiving fakes. Really basic stuff like the positive node having 4 prongs(instead of 3 for samsung cells), pvc text having different font, no markings on cell, etc. are being overlooked....
http://budgetlightforum.com/node/60547

You can't just chuck batteries into a smart charger, see that the capacity is close to its advertised capacity of 3000mah and say "OK. These cells are authentic" 

A 3000mah battery rated for 5A is not the same as a 3000mah battery rated for 20A. Potentially fake batteries need to be tested for discharge, whether that be a temperature test or with a discharge station, whatever. I still have not seen a single instance of anyone verifying 18650 purchases from china with a discharge test. Always the same "Has xxxx mAh!! All good here!!"

Just buy one test it and then buy the rest you need if they're real.
Maybe @bartroosen12 can say how the discharge is for his cells.

When you buy one or a few batteries for testing they will send original batteries as soon as a bigger order is made there is chance of fake Batteries within it. This way it can be hard to argue. Fake artists at their best tricks!!!

"UPDATE

The links above are for archive purposes. The seller has commited fraud, and is not trustworthy.

He has sold fake Samsung 30Qs, and therefore, he probably sells other fake cells.

The Liitokala Factory store IS FAKE, and is not the real Liitokala Official store."


if you read you would see that the links aren't from the official liitokala store, but the factory store, many have tested discharge with the official seller and it tested perfect, but don't buy from an imposter store for a few cents less and expect the best.

I think if you are abroad trying to buy cells is very hard because probably the ones selling outside specialise in selling scams. Anyway I am like undercover agent, I'm living in China I could find potential stores and buy for testing but I have no discharge testing station.

I am almost finished finding where to buy ones. Normally I pretend to be Chinese customer, I ask for a discount for buying 50 cells bevause it looks like here in China only people who smoke e cigarettes will buy so good batteries so they normally buy 1 or 2. I always say I want 50 for a project and need them to make a discount, what I think gives away if batteries are original is that some after much talking actually go low like 15rmb each and some say they can't go bellow 22rmb because they lose money or don't even make profit, so I am wondering about buying from this guys that give me a very very hard time lowering the price because if it is fake they don't fight so much to keep price high.

My opinion, but because I am still not sure and I can't test what I get im still thinking about what I should do.

There are a lot of stores on Taobao selling genuine batteries, you just have to take the time to research. China makes a lot of battery packs and they buy it from battery importers locally.

I have read through that thread, all 16 pages and there isn't even a consensus on which one is the "official" liitokala store. 

Can you tell us which one is the official seller? And can you link to the post of someone whos done a discharge test?

Strange 🤔
If you look through some pictures on the Ali link you sent, the cells have often the same serial number 
How can it be?

That’s what I had when I bought.
Don’t need to be bad cells, but also not original

Yes, I saw that too but the guy proofed they performed well. Maybe they are using the serial number as a batch number instead of an individual cell number. Just a guess.

Who knows. Maybe he they sent him some real samples to test. Nobody know the backstory to this video.
But it does not mean that this bad batteries in general. Just don’t like that they write something on it what is not inside just to sell them better.

dunno what shop you looked but the official store doesnt sell Samsung 30q.
Always look at the store that sells, not what the picture says, thats very important on aliexpress
Edit: looks like the store content changes depending where you are located. Just realized that. You are right, that doesnt look right.
