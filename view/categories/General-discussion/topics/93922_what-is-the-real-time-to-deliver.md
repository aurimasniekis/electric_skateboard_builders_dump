Hi riders,

I am just doing some statistics to finalize my forecast, as this summer I will launch my First esk8 project.
I should probably use a prebuild as baseline  on which I will do some customization, so to identify critical path and try to schedule a realistic project plan I need your assistance and return of experience on time to deliver to Europe from vendors:
Bioboard,
Lacroix,
TorqueBoards
Enertion FocBox Unity,
enclosure, 
batteries, wheels, trucks, deck, command, etc...
```

Just go buy one from there, I don't think any customization is needed with those!

My few cents:

Check out the enclosures from @Eboosted , Pick one avaible for a board you like. And just like that you got board and enclosure off your list, one of my most sadisfying builds has been my trampa carver and eboosted enclosure, looks amazing. 

Personally I assemble my own ESC's but if you can't, theres a wide range to choose from.

Battery you either get tools and build yourself or oder from someone here. 

BMS and charger is usually from bestech or supower.

Any oder made from china or ebay could run you 3 months of delivery time tho. Best (and most affordable) way to build is to buy parts off other builders. (and horde them obviously)

I think you can count on 100-150 working hours on your board+delivery times. 
IF you're unsure of how long an item takes to arrive, I'd ask the vendor.

I don't know... bioboards, lacroix, kaly etc. for a firsttimer? :roll_eyes:

I started slow and cheap - I just had a look if this esk8 stuff is my thing and getting into it.
most of us have several boards so you can up the ante as you go if esk8 is your thing.

I bought a cheap complete board as my first ride.

i for myselfe can say that i just found my direction with my first board. made things better on the second and from the 3rd i know what i need to order for the 4th to get it how i want :rofl:

but other people might be lucky and find exactly the one and only board with the first one they purchase.

Hi @Andy87,

I am 51 y.o. so if it takes 9 months to get products, 1 year to practice before to request an upgrade...
I will near 60 when configuration will be ok.
So I have to find whormhole to shotcut delays.

it was a seriouse answer. if you build your stuff by your own and buy things on back order or plan to get custom made stuff in your build one year is a good timeline. i was waiting 4,5 month on motors only which where on back order....(6weeks for a backorder was written on the side)... I donÂ´t want to know how long people wait for ther unity to arrive etc. etc.

I think you understand by your own that the question you ask, nobody can answer. Probably even not the vendors as they again depend on delivery form others and customs and what ever.

So if you want to know your delivery time than buy just stuff which is in stock, donÂ´t ask for custom made things and donÂ´t ship over boarders.

1 year is actually wery realistic when it comes to building a board. Think it tooked about 8-10 months for me when I was building my first board.. But that was 4 years ago..
You could build one a lot faster if you buy your parts from members who's selling their stuff here on the forum tho..

I've bought parts off bioboards, I get good vibes from that company, good communication and the stuff arrived as expected and when expected. If I had a big wedge burning a hole in my pocket I'd be contacting them to find out when they could ship to me, if I had extra I'd be bribing my way up the list, a beautiful machine.

You didn't list Trampa, they could probably get a board to you by next week. You'd still need to source batteries though, maybe another week from hobbyking if you opt for Lipos. Factor in another week navigating the site and agonising over the million options for wheel /rim/spring colour.. Etc ðŸ¤”

I'd say, that's impossible.

You will know what you like/dislike by trying your first board, then you will begin to build eboards constantly in order to chase your dream board, if you ever find an amazing combination of research, speed, torque, range, comfort, looks then you will be extremely happy and will enjoy it a lot, unfortunately only for a while because you will realize you need more boards for every specific situation and the wheel keeps spinning until complete indigence.

Hi @L3chef @Andy87 and all,

esk8 is a new domain, as my experience book is a blank paper! 
According to my experiences in other domain, I was thinking that rules should be the same and time is count in days or weeks rather than months or quarter..

ie, When I was working with a shaper to get a new surf-kite board (from blank or to adapt an existing model to fit my body shape and the surf program, delays have nevers exceeded 6-8 weeks.

I was thousands miles away to think that core hardware for esk8 as Unity, desks enclosures motors will require months to get them from vendors.

I trust you as you are on the experimented side, I am going to update my plan, but I am really disappointed to know that esk8 vendors are dealing hardware with eyedropper. Few days ago I was reading that customer were doing beta-testing on motors (TB DD with some issue with sensors), so if beta-testing requires also months between batches, I have to be patient!

About 70% of the good gear has a long wait so id start ordering now. Some have longer waits than others but dont go for something just because it will ship faster. Patience is key to building a good board. Wait for those good parts its worth it.

Yah just need to adjust expectations if you want the latest and greatest you'll need to wait and/or be part of the beta testers/early adopters.  You can buy plenty of completes off the shelf (literally and metaphorically), but if you're aiming for the stars then you'll need to put your patient hat on :)

I've been pretty lucky so far and am willing to compromise on parts in many cases for a cheaper price and faster turn-around (I didn't have steady income when building my board, will probably do a more proper one in the nearish future, but use mine for commuting around town primarily).

Cheap --- Fast --- Good

you can usually choose two at the expense of the third.

If you want something fast get a prebuilt or order parts which in stock and you will not need to wait long.

But if you want something special than it takes its time. Also consider please that a lot of esk8 stuff is made from guys who doing this as evening thing, one man show after work, with family or other things which need to be handled in life, so progress is sometimes slowly. But thatâ€™s how it is. Iâ€˜m here one year and maybe older members can confirm that invention and progress was way much more slowly some more years ago. 

Really, get a prebuilt to find your way and while you riding the prebuilt you can start order parts for your diy.

Yes, I will ,
My objective is to get a board that fit my expectation, and not to reduce delay, as it is not yet possible to ride delays :wink:
I can imagine that delays requires a lot of time, I've sent to lacroix an email yesterday morning, with some basic questions on their boards and availability, no trace of an answer, even a mail saying that they received my email and going to answer in a couple of days...

Funny thing is i started by ordering a prebuilt board, it took way too long  so i ended up building 2 DIYs before i got my prebuilt board haha.

I used the Prebuilt board for a few months thinking it was going to be awesome but my DIYs made the prebuilt feel slow so i sold it.

You should NOT buy a DIY board or from a DIY builder because you're too complicated as an individual and I imagine absolutely impossible to please. If you buy from one of our members here they will have to deal with years of your quirks and it will be a disaster.

You seem very keen on Evolve, the GTR is available now on sale, it is delivered immediately. Buy that and head over to reddit for your future advice.

Thanks for coming

Thanks @b264,
 I was thinking something similar: start with an open prebuild and then do some light customization while I use it and start in parallel to build something from scratch using high-level modules at the begining and going to lower layers step by step.
I've understood that if I am starting now from blank sheet w/o any board glued to my foot to practice and get skills I would never finalize my project or I will spend  a lot of time money to get a shit board.
 as a full prebuild seems to cost as expensive as a DIY but with components that does not fit to the current state of work, I am trying to identify a good compromise.
Thanks for your assistance, it is always positive to read such advertisement, guidelines and return of experiences rather than pseudo raw facts from never met before guys.

Hi @b264, @McErono, and let me complete this shortlist with  @klaus79856, he also spent time off forum discussion to share by email and phone his experience and point of view, this is exactly that I am expecting from a community. 

Thanks a lot for your assistance,

I gonna follow your guidline and choose a prebuild from a major actor with reactive delivery in Europe.
even if Lacroix's and  DIY gurus approaches are very sexy, as most of them are overseas localized, for the first experience it would be a nightmare.

I will continue to deep dive into forum for one month, and take my final decision first week of July (I need also to get my money back from Low businesses vendor before to engage money).

Bioboards (Thorium X AT) are top shortlisted, MotherboardX in 2nd position, 
Evolve far away in 3rd as many interrogation and no yet feedback about their battery, controllers, and ...

please continue to share information, guideline with me, as a novice, I need your experience to secure my esk8 rider experience. 

sincerely,

Fred alias Pura Vida

@Pura-Vida Metroboard is US based. thats why I recommend Evolve to you - its a wellknown brand, has a repaircenter in Switzerland (in Luzern) and they just swap the motorcontroller box or battery out in case and you are good to go again.

For sure,

Even if I am in Switzerland it is also for my job, so I do not mention them as I did not yet have a look on their catalog, and this is for this reason that I've said that my final decision will be in July.

To be transparent with you, Strampa was introduced to me during phone call with @klaus79856 this morning. we were exchanging on the wheel settings to fit my use case.

But as I did not have more than 30 seconds to visit their website and read feedbacks or experiences about them, I prefer to say nothing rather than non objective analyze even if a guru here call that raw facts.

Fred I feel like you think I resent you for some reason but that's not the case at all. As mentioned before by me and pretty much everyone above me in this thread and other threads you've taken part in you should buy a board from a large vendor with readily available service centres. 

Let me elaborate. My board is build from the best current standard diy parts available. It's a poster of cumulative knowlege of people much smarter than me who blazed the trail. It's still fucking broken 50% of the time ðŸ˜‚

Most people riding diy baords have a small fleet if they plan to commute or ride regularly, these things are bombing down the road vibrating like jackhammers with overweight old men who can't afford a Ferrari but need that sweet midlife crisis on top of them. They break.

If you buy from evolve your turnaround for repairs when your board breaks down (and it will) will be very short. It's clear that this is a big concern for you. Please take the advice.

Secondly I appreciate that you are likely a non native english speaker, believe it or not neither am I. But you speak almost exclusively in marketing buzz words and its pretty damn hilarious. 

Calm down my friend. You're planning 20 steps ahead and you simply don't need to. Buy the evolve, ride it hard, have some fun and when you're ready for more worry about that when the time comes!

Keep the evolve though always, try keep one board working.

Come to the paris meet up in July and try a bunch of boards perhaps? You're welcome to have a scoot on any of mine and I'll buy you a beer... as long as you dont try sell me an advertising campaign.

I don't know much about Bioboards (@mackann) but they are relatively new on the scene.  I suggested Metroboard (@isabar) because not only is it one of the highest quality prebuilts, but it's nearly guaranteed to deliver in a few weeks in perfectly working condition.  In DIY/custom esk8, that's ***NEVER*** a guaranteed.  Any board that's custom is likely going to take a while, and I'm not sure if those are custom or prebuilt boards.

Both of them respond to my email in less than 1h, I know that a sell request is more attractive than maintenance one, 

BB has stocks,  they can deliver to FR or CH before May 23rd (simulation done this morning DHL Express), and VAT is managed by DHL/UPS...

Bioboards is topnotch stuff, way more speed and torque AND thats the reason I don't recommend it to you. Wanna kill yourself? 

Have you ever ridden an esk8 before? just a cheap weak chinese board? Would you give a ferrari to a guy that got no driving licence? 

Wont be cool to eat tarmac and watching your monsterboard for weeks while you heal up...

The GTR is already a lot to handle for a novice. My honest recommendation is an exway x1 pro for your first board e-longboard.ch

They do. Especially if they are overpowered. Enertion... I am not telling fred he should stick with Hubs. Just getting into esk8ing while planing his diy build. Hubs are cheap (literally) no maintenance, less torque.

Fred will be ending up with a diy build but he is inpatient, 51 years old and never eskated before and the purpose of my inputs is to get him up to speed quick and safe.

Sounds like he has board sport experience tho. I don't think he needs training wheels.  Most pre built remotes I've seen have speed settings so whatever he gets to start should be fine.

I just think if he plans on building a DIY after a prebuilt, That whatever prebuild he gets should be similar. That way he learns what's what.

I just worry the only thing he'll learn from a prebuilt hub board is that he doesn't like hubs.

Hubs have their place. If you're on a budget, or need something stealth i get it.

There still is good hub on the market thought, not to mention the obvious hummie hubs, MAD hubs and the enertion ones
I find exway's hub very nice, not to violent on the confort of the ride (for me the biggest downside of hubs), also Mellow hubs are very very good, very small, but packs a lot of torque and power, and they're working with only 8S on the mellow drive, so imagine them in 10S or even 12S ! (okay 12S might want to kill you with that over the top top speed)

Also, there is Swissboard, well it's still a work in progress at the moment but it should be out before summer, as the name tells it's from Switzerland, they'll have direct drive motors, it's the perfect mix between the power and confort or normal motors but with the stealthiness of hub motors

I was:
Last year, I've ordered a raptor 2.1 this choice was driven by the capacity to get a surf feeling and power...
Then I've canceled my order as this vendor did not respect delays and quality check processing.
I will stop discussion about them, the less I can get from them the better I am (except about Unity).

As Marc @McErono wrote it, I gonna use this board to practice and get skills loosing as much life as possible...
Then, I will open my mind to all options

To complete my post: 
My budget is 2.5kâ‚¬ VAT & shipping excluded (+/- 10%).

But one spec is important: I will daily use the board to go to my job, and have to mixte esk8 and public transportation, so the weight is also important < 16 kg, as the board will have to share the same bag than my laptop, helmet and protections during public transportation.

Range is between 7-11km and can reach 15 if the wind is blowing the good direction.

Visiting it's website there is 2 models, and also demonstration models that are 60% of the price of a new one and get the same 2 years warranty.
What do you think x1/x1 pro and new or demonstration?

Thats the range of the x1. X1 pro has double that! No demo board - I bet one of them is the soaked board in the video :sweat_smile:

I will certainly,
But riders here gave to me some good guideline as delays seems to go by months or quarters, so I gonna buy a pure prebuild to start to practice and get a real idea of what I want as specification and then in // I will start a DIY project.

One advantage to be 51 yo engineer, is that I have into my contact list some subcontractors that are doing manufacturing for aerospace industries and own industrial CNC for prototyping that are able to mill TA6V alloys. 
They did it for me at materials cost only ( labor and services were for free).

"Most people riding diy baords have a small fleet if they plan to commute or ride regularly, these things are bombing down the road vibrating like jackhammers with overweight old men who canâ€™t afford a Ferrari but need that sweet midlife crisis on top of them. They break.".   


 So true.   I give my wife this same speech each time she say "you are too old for this skateboard thing".   Once I save enough for race car I will give up my  diy electric skateboard.

Hi @McErono, 

so I've checked on websites as well as youtube many comments and video.

Timeline @10:45

https://youtu.be/eFz1y1SHgE0?t=645

Timeline @8:45

https://youtu.be/9nKiM29a8OA?t=528

it seems that Exway is getting bad comments on range and wheel from 1X and this continue (wheels scratch) with 1X-PRO.

even if support is local, to have to go for maintenance every month is not sexy.
Do you have some feedback to share with me? I was ready to bypass the brainstorming period and to sent my order next Monday (tomorrow) but now after YouTube watching I will continue on my initial path: Decision in July, bypass is over!

@BoostedBuilder: Thanks for your notification, but boostedBoard does not have any representative near my locations (France/Paris, Switzerland/Lausanne), nor Europe. Can you confirm it to me?

this is something mandatory for maintenance.

hub wheels tend to chunk. they only have a thin layer of urethane on them and are under stress due to the heat of the motors. I have 500km on my x1 (non pro) and changed the backwheels once. 5 screws are involved each wheel. the x1 comes with spare wheels and they are better than anything E delivered so far :wink:

warranty maintenance is for battery or esc issues. if you donâ€˜t want to loosen a few screws, change wheels without a service center, forget about esk8ing and certainly never ever build a diy board. :sweat_smile: maintenance is crucial in esk8ing!

I wouldnâ€™t talk about range and mentioning boostedboards. the x1 has bad range like boosted. x1 pro has double that like I told you yesterday already. mate, its just a cheap beginner board, donâ€˜t make it too complicated.

Hi @McErono 

No no it is not my spirit, 
here in France when you buy something, warranty coverts full equipment except that is ordinary wear and tear or wrong utilizations.

Such scratches that are nor ordinary nor concequences of a wrong utilization would be covered by vendor warranty in France.
But if rules are different in Switzerland, I will play with this cards...
My question was just how many rides or KMS before some scratches. 50km range or 500 km range is not the same.

Chunking is mostly no issue in our country... you know how much money they spend on our roads :wink: even if you have some little ones you wont feel them while you ride. But hubwheels always look shitty after a few rides (except hummies of course :wink:)

I check my boards before and after every ride. When I see a crack building I glue it = no chunks on my x1 wheels so far.

All wheels can chunk... some boas I've seen looked awful.

Wheels are wearing parts no warranty does cover skate wheels unless the manufacturer fu**** up bad like E.

You are going to loose your money with this small budget shits.
They cost at least 33% to 50% of a nice board.
Bioboards as well as others accept to activate speed, torque limitation  by software. So you practice riging a soft Mustang

So your first board ever was a 2500euro bioboard... brave and determined move. 

Funny how we forget how we started and only have eyes for the absolute top stuff and other circumstances don't matter anymore.

But again its not just about which board Fred should get. He needs it quick, he needs it stealthy (illegal in switzerland), portable (6.8kg vs. 13kg) and the plan is to go diy further down the road. Bioboards geardrive is everything but silent or stealthy. We pay 650usd fines if we get caught on an esk8 over here...
