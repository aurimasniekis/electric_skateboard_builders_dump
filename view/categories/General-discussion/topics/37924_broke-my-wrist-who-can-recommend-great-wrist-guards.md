So this happened yesterday:

In a classic case of shutting the barn door after the horse has bolted, can anyone recommend top notch wrist guards that can be used comfortably with a remote?

Oh yeah and wear protection folks! Had pads and a full face helmet on, so apart from the wrist and some bruised ribs I got was ok...

I'm getting a OneWheel soon. By looking at the OW galore... and even after 25 years of skateboarding being me with a quite good ability on falling/recovering from fall, I ordered a TSG wrist guard. They are top quality.

Sorry to hear about that. Hope it heals well and fast. I just use a triple 8 wrist guard, then slip a husky work glove from Home Depot over it. No issues using the nano-x or mastercho gt2b mod. Helmet and wrist guards always even if I'm just going to the mailbox. Anything longer and the elbow and knee guards go on.

All the best.

Sad to hear that, man.
Get well soon.

Time after time I think about possible scenarios that can happen on our esk8...it's the risk that I'm still willing to take. But wherever I see posts like this I start to rethink it all over again.

Thanks @Crossfire

Yeah I know what you mean, but a life without risk and adventure is no life at all.

I am itching to get back on my board, despite the insane levels of pain I went through yesterday.

Just ride defensively, and the big lesson I took away was look out for complacency...
Oh and wrist guards, always wear wrist guards.

This is what I use when it's not cold.  I use the one with full fingers when it's colder.

Hillbilly is a great suggestion! They've been at it for a long time. I actually hung out with them a few times years ago. <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/c/c/cce2cd7029bb96cb1d4eda4d8fd0d9011e481c97.jpg" width="334" height="500">

although I did have two policemen (police persons? one was a woman) come and chat to me just beforehand as they couldn't work out why I had a full face helmet on a skateboard. Once they saw the motor and asked the inevitable question they understood and just wanted to chat about electric skateboards and how cool they were.

I like these ones from Demon.  Made for snowboarding and they seem a lot more comfortable than many I have tried.  I haven’t had any issues through years of park skating in them.  The shell is made of neoprene and is soft and flexible.
