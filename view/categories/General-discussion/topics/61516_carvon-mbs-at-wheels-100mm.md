Hi guys !
i have ordered 4 sets of MBS ALL TERRAIN 100mm black color online from CARVON. They seem very nice.
i have paid them but i am always waiting for the delivery for 3 months now.
i sent mails to Carvon but there is no answer.
I was wondering if it is normal because Jerry is very busy.
How can i get in touch with Jerry to talk about my order ?
Thank for your advices.
