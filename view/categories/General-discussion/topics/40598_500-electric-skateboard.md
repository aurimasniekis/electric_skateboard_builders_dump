You will experience drop outs with that remote. Get 1 from @JLabs

Also, do you want to run your 2 batteries in series or parallel?

Go with the motor @Decdog suggested. By doing this you can run your board on 12s, and have a greater top speed and your Vesc will run cooler. You can always Get some cheaper 608 bearings ~2$ from ebay and save 20$. 

Other than that, there is really nothing you can do to make it cheaper without compensating quality. You can always press your own deck, but you will only save about 10-15$, so in your case its not really worth it.

that pulley kit will not work correctly. The wheel pulley ID is too small by 2mm for caliber trucks,however it will work with paris. If you are able to make the ID bigger or to file caliber hanger, then it will work.

The hobbyking motor mount is cheaper than almost anything else.

That thin motor mount is going to fuckin' snap on you. Don't mean to be rude, but it has happened before with someone else on this forum, and it WILL happen to you.

I'd buy an HK mount or go all the way and get a mount from @marcmt88

You could get your deck, bearings, wheels, griptape, and hardware from here. They have skate tools too.

the only thing you're missing is a power switch, some way to charge the board, and an enclosure. This is otherwise a pretty well-specc'd build for $600 and you're on your way to having a sweet ride.

make sure to factor in costs for connectors and loctite too.

I think batteries will be used in parallel, so this motor would be pretty good for 6S.
@austinnc6
This setup will get you to 28mph. Which seems pretty fast.

 In addition to all this add these wheels, as you will need wheels. The wheels come with sort of decent bearings, so no need to buy bones for now.

As i82 said. Get this mount instead its cheaper and maybe even better

There is really no good benefit of doing a 6s build compared to a 12, If you are getting the focbox anyway. The 12s would be better than the 6s in everything.

Happened to me too, get one from @marcmt88 you wont regret it

Also youd need wires, bullet connectors, and xt90s (preferably) and a antispark

It might be worth looking at this set of pulley for your trucks. More expensive but better than filing down the Aluminium one's I previously suggested.

Get this motor, it's cheaper and the kv is MUCH better https://hobbyking.com/en_us/kd-53-30-high-voltage-brushless-outrunner-190kv.html

edit: didn't realise you wanted to run 12S.  12S means you need a more expensive vesc.  If you run 8S then you can cheap-out on the vesc

No I think he mans to run 6S in parallel for more range. In that case his motor would be a better choice since its 250kv. He is insistent on getting FOCBOX though. Maybe wait for Christmas sale if they have one? In a week or two a lot of people would be selling FOCBOX for a bit less here as well, maybe op could wait for that.
