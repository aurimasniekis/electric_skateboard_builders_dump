I've been looking to build a new board and want it to be perfect, 99.9% of the time people use plastic timing blets , enertion, evolve and boosted used plastic belts for there drive train, but I have also seen people use metal chains.

What are the pros and cons of using timing belt or a timing chain? Thanks

It is said that the chain drive has more reliability, and lasts longer. It is also heater for riding off road, because rocks and debris can not get haughty in it. I'm not sure why more people don't use chain drive, maybe because of how it looks, it because of the availability of parts

It can also take the torque and stress of braking better than a belt.

It will be noiser and harder to replace I believe.

Overall cost...

Chains need a lot more maintenance then belts. You need to lubricate them every so often and you'll also need to clean them regularly due to the fact that dirt, some small garbage from the road, etc sticks to the oil and therefor the chain.

Also, chains are from metal, so they'll cause for a faster wearing of your drive-train. --> need to replace whole set instead of just the belt.

Efficiency wise, the gain you'll get by using a chain is soo small ( < 1% ) that it isn't even worth it.

So why do bikes etc use chains instead of belts ? 
First, belts don't work with derailleurs. --> some fixed, single speed and hub gears bikes use belts. (hub-gear = hard to maintain, so not that familliar)
Secondly, chains won't snatch as quick as a belt would due to debree. ( if maintained well )

here is a good article about it if you want to learn more ...

i don't think either is better or worst, chains last longer but require more maintenance and are a lot nosier.   The reason most people use belts probably has to do with the small wheel size and space limitations under the board.

Yep, I can't imagine you'd have a lot of space for a chain on 80mm wheels.

Plus belts are cheap, light and really easy to replace when worn.

For me, chain has been a lot cheaper. 
My motor sprocket costs me $5, and my wheel sprocket costs $7, then $8 for chain = $20, whereas one pulley would cost me about the same.

Chain also takes less space and allows for a wider variety of gearing ratios.

chain drive- if youre gonna be off road more than 30% of the time riding

If youre just gonna be off road a little on light dirt or something then go with belt.

I haven't tried them yet but this looks like a pretty good place to get chains and parts

http://www.andymark.com/default.asp

Be sure to use the Ansi #25 chain, not the big bicycle stuff.

I have gotten my chain from McMaster (expensive) and make my own cogs on a small CNC mill out of Delrin.  So far so good, but honestly not that many miles on them yet.

I didnt like chains at all - mine was wearing down quicker than my belts (probably the chain was a little too small for the 6374s), and I kept it lubricated, which always caused a MESS just about everywhere on the board.

Ehh having a chain drive that close to the ground would need lots of maintenance.... bikes have less maintenance because the actually drivetrain is higher up. 

Belts are better overall for eBoards.

I've never used a chain but my belt has been pretty awesome so far. It lost some teeth once after a year of using it and I'm pretty sure it was because of my esc's terribly hard braking. Here's where I get them for really cheap: [link](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ISCESHI/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o06_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
They're really easy to change on the go and you can always keep a spare in your enclosure.

They will both have similar rolling resistance since most of the resistance is from the motor not the belt/chain. 

Unless of course your belt or chain is way too tight.

I toyed with the idea of having a freewheeling cog - something with pins in it so you could pop the pins out and use it as a regular board.  Mostly I wanted this when my board broke down and I had to push it home.  Lately they've been pretty reliable so this dropped off the list.

If I ever get back to working on the 2-speed transmission I might add freewheeling in as part of that.

Do you have any renders of it? I'm really curious of how that would look and work. Have you considered a CVT since there is no switching of gears to drop power. Also it would automatically switch according to rpm.

I don't - my first run at it was a total failure so I shelved it.

But my idea was to do it the same way a motorcycle transmissions works - with little balls in the driveshaft and the shift rod has an indentation - so when you move the shift rod it engages/de-engages different gears.  It would be pretty easy with a 2-speed, which is all I want.  I just need something that allows me to climb hills without having to add the weight and complexity of a second VESC/motor. 

I think you'd have a lot of mechanical losses with a CVT but I'm happy to be proven wrong.  Also, I'm not sure how a garage-tinkerer would build a CVT.

If a group of us wants to get together and design something I am happy to contribute both ideas and CNC/gear cutting/mechanical time.

I think this is a great idea ! You have really pushed this forward (technologically) for us on this Esk8 builders forum!

Do you mind start collecting similar minds? There was thread about CVT's, though Im not quite sure how many are willing to participate! As of right now I dont have much CNC experience nor I can freely share any material resources to help anyone! I think just a plain forum support would at least push it 2-3% this idea in the right direction..

----

On a side note - Could you describe the operation of how gears would be shifted with your described method?

I did not quite catch will you do it with a little rod / lever or not.

I assume this would be purely for hills - before a big hill, you stop, switch to a higher gear ratio, ride up a hill, then stop, switch back to the ''normal'' gear ratio and continue riding. (Not sure how practical this might be, but might work if you have more than one hill in a row and the rest of the trip is flat.. )

@Okami, [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ab3cevrg_1k) is a great video on how motorcycle transmissions work.  It does not use the same shifter system as I described (which was on a Hodaka 99cc dirt bike from the 70's) but it's the same principle.

So designing a 2-speed transmission with a neutral in it would be pretty easy (relatively speaking) based on copying this design but with only 2 gear sets.

I envisioned using a solenoid to shift from one gear to the other - you wouldn't have to stop you'd simply have a button on the remote for low gear and high gear or you could have your controller detect a low-speed/high torque combination and shift automatically.  That would also eliminate the need for push starts before engaging the motor since you'd be in low gear at stop.

For extra credit you could have the controller do speed matching of the motor and the wheels during shifting to avoid the clunk since we wouldn't have a clutch.  But since the motor has so little rotational mass I would think a quick depower before shifting would probably suffice.

Having a stepped solenoid that included a neutral would be a bit more tricky but it would be pretty slick to be able to kick the thing into neutral from the controller when some feature came up that you wanted to freeride.

Depending on how my other projects go I might have some time to look at this in the spring.

Also, I looked at CVT's a little bit - [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCEvBGT8twM) is a good video on how they work.  You can see that if you use a belt-style CVT you'd have a lot of losses because of the tension against the belt.

There are some more advanced designs, but that's where the complexity vs. garage-tinkerer issues comes in play.

Lots of good points have already been made here but I thought I'd throw my opinion of cost in. I've seen a lot of people saying chain and sprocket costs more us front. I just purchased 3 feet of #25 chain, two 11 tooth sprockets, and two 30 tooth sprockets to drive my dual diagonal board all for $32 total after shipping (shipping was free). So just saying, it's not necessarily cheaper to go with belt and pulley. Plus I'm willing to bet other replace their belts more often that I'll replace my chain :)

I went with a chain drive too, for me it was the only choice as I wanted durability and strength. My parts cost less than £20 and I have a spare, slightly smaller sprocket, and loads of chain left over.

I always hear people say how chains get dirty and have to be oiled and are louder etc. I know from bikes and videos of chain drive boards that theyre not that different from belt in terms of noise. The chains can be covered, thereby resulting in them never getting dirty. Bikes are typically oiled every few hundred miles, which is just putting a bit of oil along the chain so I dont think it would be too different for this. The only remaining issue with chains is the parts wearing out, which I don't think would happen more than once or twice a year at worst. 

My current board hits only around 18mph at top speed and yet the belt feels like it can barely handle that and skips teeth if trying to accelerate hard or break fast. The first one broke in like 2-3 months of light occasional use. I ended up spending $20 to get a good quality one to see if it made any difference but it feels the same. The board I'm building will be hitting around 30-35mph and I'm just not sure if I'd trust belts at those speeds.

Up north in newcastle :unamused:

I'm keen on having chain since im 6,3 and 85kg so I get soooo much belt slip and shredding!

I looked at your blog there, you've done a nice clean job. Seems like you have access to a few tools I dont, would it be possible at all for you to sort me out with drilling some holes in sprockets etc? Bolts for the wheels, and a grub screw on the motor pulley (if there isnt one)

PM me if you get a chance i'd be grateful :)

Thanks, I tried, although now it looks a lot more beat up! lol

Hmm I don't mind doing it to be honest, but I couldn't say exactly when I'd have the time to do it, I'm just so mega busy lately.
For the holes in the sprocket (for the bolts) you could easily just do those with a cordless drill, the same with the holes through the wheels, although you may not have to do that depending on which wheels you get.

The pinion you get should come with a grub screw hole pre-drilled, not sure why mine didn't, just a mistake I think.

The rest of it I'm sure you could do with a handheld drill.

i tried both systems, the time to replace a chain or a belt is the same, just remouve the tensione and replace.
So i prefer the chain, i tried to drive in the dirt in the forest, with out do any maintenace to the chain, for many many kilometers, no oil, no washing, just only for test the resistance.
So i see if you buy a good quality chain pinion and crown you can ride really for kilometers and kilometers.
with all of dirt i burned one motor but not the chain.

So i think maybe the belt it's more beautiful to see, but i think it's not comparable with a chain.
I'm not telling that one is good and the other not, but telling only that are two different style not comparable
