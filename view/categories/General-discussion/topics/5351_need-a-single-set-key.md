you can also use a small 3mm bolt - this is what Torqueboards/DIYes uses - more torque to tighten and easier to remove.  Super easy to strip those small set screws.  As long as there are two to balance out...

i have an assortment like this - $12'ish:
https://www.amazon.com/Hilitchi-200pcs-Socket-Assortment-Plastic/dp/B014OMFU1I

edit - you need a keyway piece, not set screw.  whoops.  (need more coffee)

here's a keystock set - it looks like they are typically undersized and the 1/8 might fit with some minor sanding/filing:

                  3mm - 3/32 inch - 0.118          
                                    
                  4mm - 1/8 inch - 0.157
                  

https://www.amazon.com/60-Piece-Keystock-Assortment-Set/dp/B005JZCPWC
(again about $12 - but probably slow shipping)

Karmannghiagirl's idea is looking better and better if you need an immediate fix!
