What's the deck width on your everyday board?

[poll type=regular]
* 4in
* 5in
* 6in
* 7in
* 8in
* 9in
* 10in
* 11in
* 12in+
[/poll]

I am collecting feedback for designing my next enclosure to 3D print. I want to make something fairly universal so the rest of this community can use it (If it turns out well that is :grinning: ). I'm mainly curious what the minimum deck width people use is as that is the main constraint. 

Thanks in advance for your feedback!

Edit: Concavity preferences in the comments would also be useful to see :sweat_smile:

9.5" 10chars

Edit:
@DragonSwagin second poll = concavity

How much do you like concavity of your boards?
[poll type=regular name=concavity]
* concave
* slight
* none
[/poll]

I have mixed feelings..  due to surfing.. I like pintail styles...wide up front narrow in back... 

So preferably 9.5-10" up front and 8-8.5 in the back

It won't let me add an additional poll, but concavity preferences from everyone would also be extremely useful knowledge!

new thread ;-)

Also add a poll for "preferred" concave and "don't like" concave

Like, what type do you prefer, and what type can you not stand

I don't want to start throwing out poll threads left and right. I'll give it a day or two before making a new one :joy:

while there are lots of ways of making a deck fit, I love my rayne fortune but my arbor highground was instantly comfortable.

big wheel flares to help with pockets front/back, the back tapers in, then out for the flare so you always know where you are. W in back too so I find it comfy in tuck but also as you transition/rotate your foot, and you get great leverage on the cut out-rear-flare. It is a old design but it just works for me.

I'm not even going to vote in the concavity poll because some concave I like, and some hurts my feet really bad.  So without being more specific, there is no correct answer listed there.

Any answer I picked would be untrue, essentially

That looks sketchy as f***... As if your front foot is on the hood of a car. And it is wedged for higher angles on both ends...

Speedboard... More like death board

Maybe Your front foot goes on the lower half? making your body lean forward and bringing your body lower to the ground less wind resistance too?
