*dramatic speech music*

The reason people on this forum think big is precisely because of DIY. 
DIY is what allows people to think outside the box instead of conforming to a pre-built and less impressive option. You're never going to be able to sell the option of 100% customisability, because it is simply something that cannot be sold.

I would like to state here and now that **this forum is for much more than just building**. I can not express enough how much it pissed me off when @onloop  stated yesterday that this forum is only for building, because that is so not true. ([October 20-22 Socal_Legend Evolve group ride VEGAS - All invited](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/october-20-22-socal-legend-evolve-group-ride-vegas-all-invited/32204/6))
It may be the esk8 builder forum, but the idea is that it is for the builders to collaborate and work on builds as well as events and other things. It is a community, and I don't think any amount of insisting that it should only be used for building purposes will succeed in convincing me. 

@onloop you can try to move people over to the other "club" as much as you want, but I and most of the other dedicated members of this forum will focus the large portion of our time here, because it is the only one where non-comformity is a good thing, and where you don't have to look at a pre-built product to be inspired. The builder forum is superior in every way, because here is where we collaborate to consistently push the boundaries of electric skateboarding, where it is simply impossible to direct 100% of attention towards that goal in a company setting.

@Onloop I would even go as far to recommend that you sell this forum since you are out of the DIY game. I'm sure many of the staff and members (including myself) would be happy to pay and keep this thing running on our own.

Please unblock the Events category. We don't want to have to switch forums to organise events. We don't want to have to compare production vs. DIY at every event. Either way this forum is superior and deserves to function as its own entity - no dictatorship.

When the esk8 club has 100x the number of users, people will happily post their events on that forum and ignore this forum.... event holders are only interested in gaining maximum exposure to a well defined engaged audience.

Fact: There are more pilots of esk8 than builders of esk8. Therefore the esk8 club will outgrow this forum very quickly and the topics of discussion will be very different as will be the culture.

This builders forum needs to be focused on innovation, technology, creation, comparison, performance data, tech stuff and the self built ethos.

Grouping information into focused logical and searchable blocks and catering to descrete groups is the exact reason this forum was so successful comoared to endless sphere and it's why diy esk8 evovled so rapidly. 

What we must acknowledge is that building and riding are too very different topics. For Electric Skateboards to go mainstream and gain traction globally as a legitimate sport it needs it's own community and it must develop its own culture.

that's a good point @onloop but limiting people expressive control isn't really good either.  i know the domain name says builders but why can't the members here repurpose that for whatever they intend?  can't builders also have a social aspect in their pursuits?

i feel any meetup or event related communication is now just going into the general category so locking the events category really isn't going to have much of an impact.

either way, we all really appreciate you moderating this site and keeping it a vibrant meeting place for us.

Not sure how events directly pertaining to comparing our builds and sharing insight into making better, faster boards isn't part of this community. If anything it drives the builders community to better itself. And it drives the development of better mass produced boards. Metro, Enertion and Evolve all benefited from this communities Tireless efforts in designing/using better parts. Locking the events category here is bullshit and doesn't provide any benefit to either forum.

Can't wait to hear all of the chatter and uninformed opinions that are going to rise to the surface at esk8 club...85% of the boards being purchased struggle to bust 15mph. People don't ride those boards. They stand on them. And they don't know shit about boardsports (especially skateboarding). So yeah,  I do agree it's going to overtake this forum but it's just a numbers game. Quantity, not quality will drown out any good info there.

Yeah telling someone with a diy eSk8 that they shouldn't ride their board here because this is where they built it, 
Makes as much sense as telling a chef he can't taste the food in the kitchen,
he needs to go out in to the restaurant to do that because the kitchen is only for cooking :confounded:

and you know as a culture: _skaters aren't known to be rebellious_

But don't get me wrong: the _club_ site does market towards a larger demographic, and one day we all might like to hang out there because there are lots of hot chicks with pre-builts...

but till that day I'm not seeing the allure :wink:

Guys let's just say it like it is ...and cut the crap.  esk8t CLUB forum is DEAD ...none of us wants to use it ...so forcing us to go there only to LURE new casual riders so that @onloop can target them with RAPTOR products in the future is bunch of BS. Besides that there is a REDDIT forum for casual guys and they have their own DISCORD chat. No need to duplicate the audience...unless someone wants to sell bunch of products.

Just think a few weeks ago, many mods and senior members were complaining about how much repetitive crap was filling the feed, people asking the same questions over & over again. Where should I buy, what motor should i buy, what vesc should i buy, my DRV fried, i can't load the firmware, Vendor XYZ didn't reply to my email, how to do XYZ stuff.... 

http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/members-doing-research

The esk8builders forum will inherently be filled with this kind of noobish help request topics because people who want to build an esk8 are often very confused about the tech and need help, or they are lazy and expect others to constantly reassure them and guide them so that they build a great board. This is unlikely to change.

**So how do you fix it?** moderate the hell out of the forum? Delete posts? No, that is not viable and if it was going to happen it would have already started, the mods are busy people and have lives, they can't be expected to filter the garbage.

**So you need to think harder** break it down to the core you soon realise the solution is actually very simple. 

**There are 4 distinct phases for folks wanting to get involved with electric skateboarding** 
**_Phase 1: DECISION_** - Buy or Build. If you choose "Build" Go to Phase 2. "Buy" Phase 4 
**_Phase 2: RESEARCH_** - Weeks & months of reading & asking questions and creating a BOM
**_Phase 3: BUILD_** - The fun begins & so do the problems, you need support & guidance and eventually showcase your creation.
**_Phase 4: RIDE_** _(Built & Bought Boards)_ - You are king of the streets, you just want to explore the world, have fun, race people, compare performance, boast about how awesome you are, talk about big ideas & the future of e-skateboarding.


**Phase 1 to Phase 3 often don't care much about Phase 4 topics & Vice Versa.**



----------


----------

## So Why Two Forums?

Different information needs to be grouped, it's why libraries have many sections; Fact & Fiction. Sport, Romance, Horror.

**Example 1:** If you bought a boosted board you don't really need to read endless threads about vesc settings, but you might be interested in knowing about an esk8 event in your local area.

**Example 2:** If you are trying to get your belts aligned with your DIY welded mount you probably don't care much about the new evolve board that is $2000

**Example 3:** If you have a working "complete" esk8, built or bought, you are probably interested in reading about what other riders are up to, group rides, different events, riding styles, different safety equipment.

**Example 4:** If you have an Evolve board (and know nothing about how it is built) you might feel intimidated / uncomfortable asking noob questions on esk8builders about how to upgrade the wheels to some nice ABEC11 flywheels. Maybe your post will simply get ignored because it's just too simple? You don't want to feel embarrassed for asking a stupid question in the wrong forum.



----------


----------

## This is not about DIY vs COMPLETE  
**It's about growing strong communities of like minded people.**

This is not an attempt to segment the market for some secret commercial agenda, it's about logically organizing groups within society to make sure we can enjoy our time spent interacting in online communities. Our time is precious! we are all busy people so it's better if you can quickly find the information that suits you best and find like minded folks who relate to you without wasting time sifting through content that doesn't interest you. 

Having all this info & different personalities & different mindsets piled into one bag is a bit annoying & actually off-putting for many. This problem is real and has already created tension in the past.

You don't go to a death metal rock concert to listen to gangster rap. You just don't go at all.



----------


----------

##  Why will the "CLUB" be bigger?

This is simple, there are more riders than people who build, especially since the complete boards are now lower in price & becoming more popular as the industry matures.

The club won't replace esk8 builders and it won't be better or cooler, it's just different. It's just a better way for "riders" to find relevant info & discussion & feel like they belong to a solid community.

You obviously don't know enertion, We endorse multi-brand events, we just did a world tour and invited all riders & all brands to come along.


https://youtu.be/Jjk_xe8U6BA



The industry will only grow & get bigger if we band together & forget about whether someone rides DIY or a pre-built brand name board. Why does it matter?

The Days of DIY being something you could only make at home is over, you can now buy "complete" "pre-built" DIY component boards from multiple suppliers. @longhairedboy @Kaly @onloop @carvon @chaka & these style of boards are dominating the mainstream brands. The only way to prove superiority is getting everyone together & race.

it's no longer DIY is better than Completes. Its simply what complete is the best & for what reasons. The whole industry improves when we unite as one.

why not just have an "electric vehicle forum"? well, they exist actually.... you can go to endless sphere right now, it covers many topics.

But the problem with broad topic forums is they get out of control and diluted, the information gets impossible to find, the moderators can't act as leaders & the culture & community is also diluted.


Anyway, why not just think about .club & .builder as one website? - once i have finished implementing the various changes you can swap between them easily.

Always gets me how Jason acts towards everyone on this forum. So quick to argue with everyone, and give a shining marketing speech about esk8. I can't help but feel you're preaching to the wrong choir. You have a whole forum of people here asking for a feature to be given back on the site and you're blocking that? Like... **what**?? Of course the .club will have more users but you miss the point in that we don't care if people post their events on that forum and ignore this one, the core users here likely don't want to be involved with them events anyway!

I'm also certain you don't want to be a part of this scene anymore, and i cannot see a reason you wont relinquish the forum? The only possible reason I can think that you won't, is to use our ideas for your personal game, which doesn't sit too well.

Restricting users of this forum by not letting us have features will kill the forum, end of

i understand it but i also understand the resistance to it. isolating builders from "just riders" may be a good idea in theory for seo and informational organization purposes but it doesn't really flow with the spirit of the community here, which is that we are only builders because we were riders first. The love of riding is the reason we've developed a love of building. 

i have mixed feelings. I get it though. From a business and organizational perspective it makes sense. 

it could potentially lead to fracturing and fragmentation of the community however. For some this may be a seen as a "final straw." For others it may be business as usual who cares. 

Whatever happens it needs to happen gently and with delicacy. This community is already fragile.

Whilst I definitely agree with the fragmentation being a bad thing, I can't see it happening since we can freely flow from one site to the other? I can see this forum growing as more people go on the .club, and want to learn more, just like we ourselves did/do. I'd certainly encourage curious people on club to come here, and would probably myself take a look at club to see what the majority (read: rest) of the scene is getting up to. 

Personally my main issue is that this forum feels way to controlled and censored, and still 'enertions forum'. And whilst ES is an alternative, I prefer this small esk8 specific community too much to go there instead.

believe it or not, what makes this forum so good is that business & community mix together. 

the community needs vendors & the vendors need the community. Not saying it's perfect but it has seemed to work out very well. The legit businesses tend to get a good reputation & attract more customers, good deals are good for the community.

Also, spamming is very rare, the community tends to be very good at shutting down fraudsters and fake accounts that appear only for profit.

neither the "club" or "builders" sites are designed to be better or worse for businesses, they are literally the same platform just with different topics of discussion. Hopefully, this means that users and business can interact better together in their chosen area of focus.

yes, that would work well.... but really needed to happen from the beginning.


this builders site is already well established in terms of SERPs, changing the structure will break links and make it harder for information to be found in search engines.

Also, changing the identity of the builder's website will also potentially alienate people. two seperate sites is a good compromise and will work better for SEO

Anyway, Pretty sure people will complain no matter what i do :slight_smile:

Hi guys, just wanted to give my input.

I personally think the .club forum is needed. 

Many of you are mentioning the fact that there's already a reddit forum for casual. Well i'm a moderator there and been using it for years. While it's great for quick chat and news, it's a terrible platform to discuss something we're all so passionate about.

Some others are saying we just needed a separate board section for complete boards. As a complete rider only (and a kinda diy hub board), that's a terrible idea. For you, DIY users, its fine, but for everyone else who don't know much about amps and circuit boards it's just noise on the screen. The .diy is still great for enthousiastes though, because that's where we learn about all those things, when we want to.

There's no great forum right now. and in my opinion .club can become the main one for complete board enthusiast. Claims that @onloop and enertion are using that forum to push the raptors are wrong. I've seen no bias or marketing moves being done on that website other than in the raptor 2 thread.

Yes it's still small and silent and mostly about the raptor 2 because it was linked here on the raptor thread that is now locked, but you just need to give it some time. More and more people are coming to discuss other boards and no one is being silenced and all brands are welcome to the discussion.

i could ban all other vendors but that's not really in my nature... as much as they annoy me at times, the community needs unity.... and competition is good. & i would be hated by everyone for doing that.

i admit I am far from perfect, but my goal is not to control everything, i just want some organization and nobody else was doing anything so i gave it a shot. mostly people like it.

if my forums can help grow our beloved industry and make it reach more people i will be happy. I think my fellow business owners would be grateful for the forums too, but unlikely they will admit that in public :slight_smile:

When the esk8 club has 100x the number of users, people will happily post their events on that forum and ignore this forum

Why not let that happen organically instead of doing this through a mod rule? Seems like a lot of work/change issues for something that you think will be inevitable.

The content is what builds the audience initially. I cannot have off topic or duplicate content across two different sites as that prevents organic growth in search engines. The "building" site is really good for the tech stuff and for promoting the self built movement. 

But when it comes to big events, grand visions of the future, the Electric Skateboarding industry as a whole, government petitions, law reforms, etc... The builder site is very unattractive, many people don't participate.

We need to think big.... Thoughts need to be followed by actions.

Boys, we cannot blame noobs we just have to make things more clear. Just got a ”noob” friend asking me How to build one that I had. I till him the basic and linked this forum and till him to read up big Times’ before even thinking of building one. Next day he came to me like. I couldn’t find any help information just arguments, sell this sell that, this is broken and that is broken. He them asked me If he would lose money. This is hard to explain but he basicly by looking at this unorganized shit made him turn down on esk8 which is the opposite of What we want.
I enden up likning all those ” complete walkthrough ” 
Threads to him and it all made sense. Why couldn’t I find this directly? 

Noobs wont be smart enough to even know What to search for so we cannot expect them to do so. The thing we can do is to make them se What they are looking for directly. This elimineras the ”maybe I should start a thread and ask someone like the others do?”

And If the dont got that Q&A then the can open a in deepth thread that this forum enjoys.

Thing Im saying is we cannot stop helping just make them help themselfs.

Pin the threads on top and make it visible not fkn grey and in the background shit.

Start like this and see and maybe then go all crazy about deleting forums or switching whatever.

Maybe you guys couldn’t understand me, maybe Im not the byggets voice here around but Im sure not going to let a community break down and get lost.

Done have a Good day

after a lot of thought about this.. i'm less worried. 

so many good points have been raised. Points such as "it doesn't matter where we are as long as we're together" and the general organization of things should be not only user freindly but also seo freindly. I get that. Build shit here, meet up there and talk about rides over there and then come over here and talk about building. ITs probably overkill, but i get it. 

Regarding the fragmentation issue, it did more or less split the community. Fragmentation did happen, just as was predicted. We're over here, they're over there, there is some cross over but plenty of people on ES don't come here and i never go there anymore. Lots of people never go there anymore. Lots of people that are here now have never even heard of ES. That will prove itself when somebody responds to this very comment and says "wtf is ES?" That's organic. This is the place for esk8s, that's the place for literally everything else. We are a fragment. That's good. 

My concern wasn't regarding fragmenting the esk8 community further in general. it was about fragmenting THIS PARTICULAR community. These people, that i know. And it wasn't a concern regarding the natural organic separation of esk8s from the rest of the DIY EV community. IT was a concern regarding the political/partisan fragmentation of people who feel differently regarding the issue of change being dictated by one person who owns the forums and benefits from it financially. That's a different type of fragmentation that typically results in an entirely new forum. Except this time, This Forum would suffer as the New Forum would grow under a different environment and philosophy.  

I only bring this up because i'm the kind of person who can make that kind of thing happen. IT would be trivial to set up a new forum on one of my esk8 domains. It would be trivial to make a fuckload of useful posts and invite everyone over there and leverage my name to shave off a good peel of this community and start my own where the keys are handed over to a small group. 

but power like that mustn't be wielded wantonly.

agreed. this is a stupid move. if @onloop really believed in what he was saying then he would send all the new Raptor2 owners to THIS forum to learn how to use the BLDC tool and app's to program the FOCBOXes to cusomise their new rides.
and there should be no threads on the club forum regarding programing and modifying.

This forum is about building esk8. Raptor 2 customers don't need to build anything. If they do want to custom tune their board software they can, all they need to know is how to plug in a USB cable and install an app.

We made a custom bldc interface just for raptor 2 customers. Much more user friendly than the normal bldc tool. We removed all the technical stuff that can cause damage. 

If people want to fully modify the R2 and make a custom battery they will come here.

Anyway... Im not sending people anywhere... People can do what ever they like, all I am doing is makeing environments that are better suited to different Peoples needs.

Have you ever been to a night club that has an RnB room and a house music room. Or drum and bass room?.... you decide the club doesn't.

People will go to the room they like the most.

@onloop

You're ignoring the elephant in the room - riders can and are organizing elsewhere.  Not here or the club.  Riders are already leveraging existing social platforms to self-organize.  Ultimately I can't see the club surviving - you're up against gigantic companies with well-entrenched user bases.  And FFS drop the .club and make it .riders - .club is too generic and sends a mixed message.  .riders tells you everything you need to know right there in the name.  Besides, the word club is a stodgy anachronism.  How many clubs do you belong to IRL?

I guess my real question is what makes the .club website special?  

To that end...

What function does .club perform that is world-class?  Why should it be the preferred destination for all things eskate?
How are you actively attracting users away from other organizing platforms?  
Where is the unique content?  
Non-technical folks don't like walls of text - how do you get around that on a forum that is structured for technical people?

I think the nail in the coffin is that every time you drive people to external sources you weaken your position.  Take group ride eskate videos.  Tishawn Fahie has an awesome youtube channel, and all the group ride info is posted in each video description.  He's actually attracting RIDERS and promoting events, and doing a hell of a job too.  Want to compete?  This is a decent model to duplicate.  Physical outreach and building community are huge.  Concrete Wave had a [great article about this](http://www.concretewavemagazine.com/single-post/2017/07/04/The-Editor-Speaks-Lets-Talk-Shop). I'm not saying you're not doing this already, but I've seen a whole lot of group ride videos lately, and none of them are from or sponsored by enertion.  Maybe its a critical mass issue, and once the R2 is out visibility will change.

Anyway, events cater to different groups.  Do you want to undermine your user base by exposing them to the DIY crowd over here?  It's basically lifting the curtain and exposing the wizard, leading to the inevitable question "This really doesn't look that hard to do on my own..." How does it benefit enertion to mix these groups together?  I imagine some DIY'ers may eventually purchase an enertion board, but I'd be willing to bet that more prebuilt folks would attempt DIY the second time around.  Especially with the way technology is advancing - smaller, better, cheaper is the mantra.

The URL is obviously important, it dictates the theme that the site is based on. But it doesn't actually matter, it could be anything. The users and the topics & content is king. esk8.builders will always be inherently technical

ALSO, one extremely important element is the user experience! This forum & .club is built using "discourse" i believe it is the best forum software available. It makes building a community easy & it makes communication easy & it makes organising data super easy. I personally think it is superior to any other social network alternative. That is why esk8.builders forum is so well loved & popular... it's just nice to use. 

it's superior to Reddit, Facebook, Youtube & Instagram

[quote="akhlut, post:66, topic:32280"]

that is not for me to decide, a forum is simply a platform, its members create content.

this esk8 forum & the club forum is not designed to capture & control anyone, in fact, it is the opposite. It's simply an open networking platform to connect people so they can communicate freely & learn about & share stuff they are interested in.

Promoting external sources is actually a key objective of mine. We all must grow together to build a bigger better community & industry.

There is an events category, it's right here: 

https://www.electric-skateboard.club/c/electric-skateboard-events

ALSO, I have made a shortcut to EVENTS in the drop down menu, just two clicks away:

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/7/e/7e6109e31cf625f7b2b28b2b58afd05349be272f.png" width="304" height="427">

**I have also emailed the hosting provider & asked if the 88 events we have here can be migrated to the club website.**


----------


----------

## The events section heavily under utilized.

* Only 88 Events created in the 789 days of the forum being here
*  Only 1 Event topic every 9 days? & this is a global community who says they love their events?.... 
*  The event topics are barely 1% of the topics on this entire forum.
* Only 2798 replies compared with over 200,000 for the site - this is only 1.35% engagement


I don't know about what you guys think, but that is really bad performance, basically, this community isn't using the events category & we are not effectively promoting electric skateboard riding as a community. This is disappointing!

It's my mission to promote riding events and bring electric skateboard riders across the globe together as one big happy family, so then we can all have more fun & promote bigger & better events. 

The way we will do this is by creating a riders club & community focused on the riding.

**Why would anyone who is truly passionate about our sport/industry not want to see more people participating in more community events?**

Give me a break... 

30 threads that had replys in the last 30 days.

There were multiple active threads that were locked with no notice, no warning, no explanation until now, three days after the fact when people have been continuously and politely saying "WTF! Why lock events?"

An explanation and the reasoning behind it is irrelevant. 

Now after 2-3 days of trying to justify your action, you are just now trying to see if you can move everything over there because you know you fd up doing it the way you did.

Furthermore...

Nobody uses message boards (forums) for group rides on push bikes, motorcycles, or kayaks ecetera..., everything's done on Facebook.

It's just easier for all and that's just the way it is.

Don't believe me? 

Exhibit A:
This WAS an active thread about a group ride. 


https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/beach-day-la-cruising-meetup-sunday-9-3/30821/21?u=idle

People don't care to let everyone in on how awesome their ride was.

They can let their clique know all about it on their FB if they want.

Or they can make a fake facebook name and not have to bother with knowing their boss or family knows what they do in their spare time.

One of the more recent events threads was for the So Cal performance day. While it was promoted on several rider sites (including the .club site), the majority of people involved came from righthere. And I dare say it invigorated a lot of us regarding build and race possibilities. It pushed the community forward. There is now no place for those sorts of events here now.

I see your long term vision of what you are working towards, but I think you are cutting off your nose to spite your face. From outside appearance, it looks like you made this decision on a whim because someone created an event you didn't agree with. It was a group ride for a competing board. You told them that group rides like didn't belong here. They posted the rules for the event section. You decided you were going to delete that section of the forum. Can you look at that through outsiders eyes and see how it looks? It's not Good optics. 

Why not discuss it with the community first and see what they think? I've heard a lot about how people view this as a family. I'd expect families to talk things out before making decisions. If part of the group doesn't feel heard, you risk losing that portion of the community.

If I could vote and I can't because the choice wasn't given. It would be to bring back the events category on this forum. Let the club have its own events category. IMO the club's event category should be allowed to grow just the same as the events category grew here. Stealing food from this forum and force feeding it to the club to make it more active only serves to distance the two. They would indeed come together and serve to help each other if allowed to grow on their own.
Let the moderators do their jobs and moderate this forum as they see fit. With or without the category. But let them decide. It seems owner has new dreams and goals and a future in prebuilts and perhaps should spend time growing that community and worry less about diy. Though we are all truly thankful it (diy) is here.

The "club" should be a category within this forum. The original eSkate forum.

My $.05 are my $.05 and cannot be changed because we no longer use pennies :/ in the great white north eh!

Speak up or you will not be heard.
