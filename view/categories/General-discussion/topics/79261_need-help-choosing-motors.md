Need some help guys. I‚Äôd like to replace the 5065 200kv motors I‚Äôm using. I‚Äôd like to go with some 63mm sensored motors. I‚Äôve got a 10s5p battery coming and I typically run 7/8‚Äù AT with 15T/58T. I‚Äôve done a little research but still unsure which brand and size. I‚Äôm thinking it would need to be 190-200kv. 
Thanks !

Apparently the maytech 6355 are bullet proof.  I say apparently because greater minds than mine told me.

I‚Äôve got some brand new 6355 uncensored motors I could sell you for $60 a motor. ![image|666x500](upload://oFiQMChr8xGXv7pKpXaNAJatrIH.jpeg)

What are the main performance differences in the motor lengths.

Cooler temperatures and an increase in available torque

Not much in performance between 55 and 74 but the 74 will run cooler under pressure.  If you have the room then go for the 6374 cans

or somewhere in the middle  like the 6365

Buy maytechs (they'll probably be sold rebranded but you can recognize them instantly), they're truly undestructable motors. Enertion used them in their R1 and shoot me if i'm wrong but LHB still uses them.

Checked out @hyperIon1 stock, I‚Äôve ordered from them
a lot. Looks like only 170kv in stock. With that be enough kv for my AT wheels ?

Remarkable similarities between the 2.  :wink:
@PickSix24  170 will give you more torque which is a good thing with large wheels.

originally talking about 6355 and the last time I looked I couldn't find a sk8 at that size with 200kv.  Its there now though.  Can you ever forgive me?

Not remarkable, rebranded.
A good majority of motors today are made by Maytech and branded with who or what‚Äôs selling them. 
The unsealed 63mm are 190kv.

If your looking for the same kind of power but sensored the unsealed 63mm are at 190kv and come in 3 sizes. 55, 65, 74
The sealed version is 170kv 
But if your looking to stay in that size the unsealed 6355 or the 6365 will be a match. 
We have a large shipment of motors coming on the 10th.

I'm still rocking my Enertion R-Spec motors (aka Maytech 6355 Unsensored MTO) on my OG Raptor. I got over 1000 miles on it without any issues. I will change the bearings out at 1500 miles.

I would recommend sealing the stator coils with high temp expoxy since they are open (which I did) for even better durability. If you have sealed motors, it is not recommended due to additional heat build up.

I do have to say that Maytech motors are very reliable (I also use with them on my drones) compared with TB, Evolve, and Turnigy models. No magnet pop out or broken/loose stator and of course no bent shaft like the others have.

Hello!  

I am too looking for the right motors for my  dual rear drive build in the making. 

Since I bought an aps drivetrain from @spiritron already i think i am happily limited to 6355s on that hanger. 

To control the motors i have two focboxes.

Until now I have only ridden a single vesc bldc hybrid aps 230kv setup powered by 10s2p. 

Now I am unsure what motors to get for the new board. 

Are you guys riding foc sensorless? Or should i also opt for sensored motors and hybrid mode (which for bldc i find rather superior over sensorless mode).

So I waver between this (sensored)

https://alienpowersystem.com/shop/brushless-motors/aps-6355-outrunner-brushless-motor-190kv-2200w/

and this (cannot get sensores)

https://alienpowersystem.com/shop/brushless-motors/aps-6355hev-outrunner-brushless-motor-190kv-2400w/

motor choices.
 
Any opinion/experience/alternative appreciated
Thx
```

These are the exact same motors I used and they are really good. I ran them on bldc and they worked great (of course have to give a little push before throttling) but if your running them FOC you should get a better start up should so I would definitely go for these!

I'm also looking at those alien motors in 6374 size, seems to be one of the better options to get in Europe price wise?

They're still on top of my list.

The smaller ones are also much lighter.  The motors and motor mounts actually contribute a lot to the board weight.  Of course the battery weight is #1 but these things are second.
