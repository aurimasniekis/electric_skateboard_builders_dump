Hi everyone, there is a guy who’s in the shanghai esk8 scene who I’m friends with that has a hand in the esk8 parts industry, and when I asked him about the unik risers, told me that he made some for his MBs trucks for about 300 rmb per set, which is about 50 usd. I will be meeting up with him soon and if anyone is interested I might be able to get some on hand although shipping is something I am really inexperienced at. What do you all think?![image|281x500](upload://kO6nzK3ukeEuQXpquMtWKVzj1cM.jpeg)
This is the one he made although he won’t be able to do any surface treatment if any of you guys are interested.

Thats for 2 pieces, i believe.

 Not super cheap but in general, motor mounts, for example, aint cheap also

I spent a lot of time finding cheap angled risers but only unik was selling and that was like a few hundred bucks for a set I believe.

Is 45 degree the recommended angle for MBS trucks?
I would be interested, provided shipping is not too expensive.

Hi have you tested riding with this? I don’t have experience with printed parts and I am concerned with durability.

personally, no... but i have 3d printed PETG rims i printed and they are pretty stable even at 30mph

if i had the trucks to use to test it i would have no problems printing and testing haha

I doubt 3d print would last long this requires alot more structural integrity than a normal spacer that is sandwiched between and truck and the deck.

i have 3d printed spacers that have lasted a while now (few months) but they arent angled like this

 :sweat_smile: I also don’t have the trucks, but mainly because I could not afford a whole MTB set up and the risers were too expensive until now.

Yeah spacer would do fine but this one is different this requires the truck to be mounted to the spacer and the spacer is mounted to the deck so the only physical connection between the two will be the 3d part with no other supports.

Would you think that if I were to mill the risers out of a block at plastic (not sure which kind would be suitable) it would be strong enough?

POM milled should

thats what we make our "plastic" gears and rims with (typically) 

as for printing this riser I personally would use nylon glass fillament

I dunno plastic may work fine but I'm a heavy guy I wouldn't try it unless it was metal lol

That is my real name, I am from Tahiti in the South Pacific and I was born before the movie was made. :joy:
Large part of the movie is inspired from our culture, I am just not pleased they used my name in a freaking crab.

```
yea its based a lot on the islander's culture and he's a pretty cool crab, just self-centered a little bit...

and @Battosaii i'm 6ft and 215lbs (naked), with gear and a pack im roughly around 230 (rounded up) so yea, my rims have held nicely going on 40-ish miles now however im working on a new design and they are going to be amazing

but for this angled riser i do plan to print and test it, keep in mind i will be orienting it where its printed for the load to be against the print lines rather than with the print lines so the object is stronger and wont delaminate or break easily

Why such a large angle? Channel trucks are usually run at a 30-35° angle.

Hi everyone, I will update the details of the availability, price, angle, mounting holes of this riser after I meet up with my Friend in a few days and talk to him about it. I will also have to check if shipping it myself will be feasible. Thanks!

Tamatoa, @Battosaii I'm still riding with the original set I printed, never yet had any problems with them. If you decide to go the printing route just make sure you orientate them on their side for maximum strength.

On a typical MTB deck there is a lot of flex so you probably get plus 5 deg with the flex when you carve hard. So on a stiff wood deck you could go a bit more than 30. 

Also the added stiffness gives your more natural stability. I didn't try it but I think 40-45 could work, so long as the deck is not too short.

Hi, I’m getting my friend to make one right now for another friend of mine,!and for just one set the price would be about 170 usd, but price drops all the way to 80 usd for 10 sets. But after realizing fulfillment from China as a solo guy would be too troublesome and not worth it, so unless someone orders 10 and distributes it themselves I don’t think it’s viable for me to do this,
