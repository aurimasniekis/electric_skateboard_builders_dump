Just found out through [Muirskate's Instagram page](https://www.instagram.com/p/BgZTMxeH9Fx/?hl=en) they are closing. April 25th is their last business day. Enjoy this store while you can. Another great business gone. :cry:

that's a damn shame.

their website is the best by far, just for that alone it'd be worth keeping around.

but in the age of instant gratification (amazon), it'd be hard to complete as a retailer, especially in a niche market.

RIP.

but gonna stock on some goodies.

awesome deck, be tough to put a enclosure on though with the Rayne fat bottom tech.

one of these would be easy though...

Just ordered a set of 107s. Boo yah, I was on the fence about these or 97s for my Carvon speed drive XLs....  this made the decision much easier.  I already have some 97s anyhow.

I would rather them be staying open though ðŸ˜¢.

E-mail him again and let him know that there is a tracked letter that's something like $7.15 to Europe (that's with tracking) so there shouldn't be a problem. 

If that doesn't work for him, I'm going to order stuff from them and could buy the footstop for you. But shipping from me to you might be like $17-$20 cause I'm in Switzerland.

Europe, should we help Muirskate clear some of their stock? 

I want to order things from them to Switzerland, I'm sure we could fit a whole lot more into the box. EU guys, do you need anything? Only items under 1kg, so shipping stays at CHF 23 around EU.
