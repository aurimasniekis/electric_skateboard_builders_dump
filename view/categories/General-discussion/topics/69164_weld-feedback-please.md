Just practicing my welds before settling down to the battery welds...

How much heat marking is acceptable on the back of the weld? Iâ€™m welding pure nickel to a scalpel blade (0.38mm thick).

Both the pattern of 4 and 2 are strong welds but I used a longer dwell on the 4 (15mS as opposed to 12mS)![image|346x500](upload://sRn37VMJQmIGbXlr5aqYX3U88aD.jpeg) ![image|429x500](upload://bPHlHTl23ivyBgm2PJ2IIfqOJJz.jpeg) ![image|375x499](upload://cAfDcyvjKLMCBr1vrS3EKhxTykV.jpeg) ![image|374x500](upload://IGHjCu4LdXvniHuuZPGcuvdd7a.jpeg)

You must avoid black marks.

If you see this picture for example:
Welds are good from 7 to 9 ms
Are too deep from 9 to 10 ms
And overkill 11+
Welds must be firm enough to need pliers to remove the nickel but not deep enough to burn the back side.
