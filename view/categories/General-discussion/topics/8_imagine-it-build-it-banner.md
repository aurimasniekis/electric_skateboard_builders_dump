Hey,

Im new here on the forum, and rather new to building boards. Been interrested in el skateboards along time now and drooled alot.. Id like to make my own soon as funds kick in.. :) 

Just as theory craft to make it easyer for people like me (novices) to build / motivate on gather parts and eq.

-----How would your dream site for DIY el. skateboard look like, what components would it have and how many/what kind of sortement. How would the layout be? packages or individual parts. If you catch my drift im interrested to know what the community would look for :sunny:
