The only problem with me is im more inclined in mountainboards :smiley:
[/quote]

By the way, that's not a market to underestimate. Evolve had a great success selling off road kits. That's not a mountainboard, but hybrids/pneumatics are something that many people could need (just thinking of cobblestone pavements here in Italy)

I think the idea of a kit approved by members of the forum is fantastic, but what price and point exactly are we trying to make? The problem if we try to go for affordability is that there are already so many companies that make really cheap dual drive kits, so I think it would be hard to market something like this for a decent price

@SirDiff  Yes, but mountainboards Im seeing now more as 'niche' market.. IT might take some time for all people to catch on, that they offer less vibration on worse roads :D 

They also require more custom made parts. A lot of trucks from the low end market I would say are not covered lol :D 

You usually either buy Trampa or MBS trucks. Then if you got different ones (like from scrub) you just weld up something or make a diy clamp for motor.

And you need to check how much trampa trucks cost :D in order to start planning total cost :D

So yeh, I think for cost reasons mountainboard is a bit out of the question now.

They also cost more to make, bigger motors, heavier - bigger batteries for the same range as longboards have.

Aren't we talking about a complete board, not kit? Complete board would be nicer but more work. Or you do a group buy with just two items, a single complete kit, and a dual complete kit.

Well.. we still need to keep the 'DIY' spirit into this one, I think, to 'keep it alive', it needs to be at least partly still 'diy'' and offer later customizability and repair possibility as diy made boards..

No, there are not many companies that do that. 
Excluding Chinese, this market starts from 500 € for bad kickstarter boards that are probably half rebranded stuff. Then there's the high range, 1100€ for singles, 1500 for duals. That's what it is. Evolve noticed it, and developed the one. 
Now, what should, or could, we do? 
First of all, I think nobody can invest that much money. That's why LHB couldn't do it by himself. I think it should be organised like a little closed group buy. Let's say I can put the money for one build in Italy, another one can get 2 in Germany and so on. Only trusted people, (not saying I'm one of those, but not newbies that have been on the forum for two weeks), we get a MOQ and pretty low prices. Only quality stuff but not the best of the best. Calibers instead of ronins (possibly genuine ones, maybe getting a deal with manufacturer), good motors but not necessarily sealed maytech's that go for 110€ even from China, buying cells from nkon in bulk and getting them spotwelded as wanted here in europe. I wouldn't go cheap with electronics, we would need a vesc producer and maybe we could go with the new smart bms that's starting to get interest (@fedestanco was thinking about a group buy production)  
In the end (personal experience) we can get a good 10s3p 25r battery with bms, 6374 sensored 190kv, carbon mount (that's like 25 euros and never breaks), clone flywheels and calibers. I got this for about 500 euros, but I wasn't buying from the manufacturer, lost like 40e on battery alone, 20 on BMS, 30 on motor. A board for 750 can be built cause I have one that costed me 200 less. That's all we need to know.

@lox897 @Okami Thanks to both of you for the feedback. @lox897, yes it is a complete board but there is still several parts to consider, and main expenses come from the drivetrain and battery. @Okami I like where you're going with this... the DIY spirit is definitely something we could use to market considering that's what this forum is all about. Maybe we could use @longhairedboy's esk8.build domain as the website, and make it a custom kit thing. Like they get to go through and select parts (decks, drive type, battery, etc.) and we send it to them as a kit with some explanation and tools and a link to this forum so that they can build it? Also, if we decide to try this I think the parts should come from venders on the forum. We can get things from different people, for example:

Batteries:
@barajabali and @longhairedboy

Decks:
@longhairedboy and @treenutter

Motors:
@JLabs and @longhairedboy

VESCs:
@zmoney @oriol360 @onloop   

Etc. 
Thoughts?

I think an all aluminium mount is better for heat dissipation. I know a carbon manufacturer as well though. I can start getting quotations if needed. Just tell me estimated quantity.

I wouldn't get VESCs made by Maytech or any other ESK8 manufacturers. The best is probably getting them made in Taiwan, I know a good place.

yeh that's is what we are trying (or at least plan) to do:

To attract and develop some sort of 'work groups' which focus just on maybe one task at hand.. then somehow come together (or ship parts over) and the next group continues on..

This is, if we really plan to develop this as _One board made by many_..

Probably opening an topic is the best course now.. as it totally depends on what kind of people are gonna be interested into jumping into this and how many from a relatively close region between each other..

I was kind of hoping for a complete board. If we want to do a $750 board I don't think we can get stuff in US, all of it has to be in China. Let me put the costs of a drivetrain in perspective for you:

Mounts: I got a small quantity of mounts a while back for personal use and they costed $13 USD each + shipping. Motor pulley and wheel pulley would cost $10-20 shipped. Belts are cheap as like under $1. Motor is usually $39-$49 depending if 6355 or 6374. Wheels can be bought (4) for $15 as clones. And trucks are $5 each from New Sports Goods

Hm, then we should really design it as a 'Package - Diy' Board or completely assembled and made board (like the direction you @lox897 are leaning towards) .

Though, this is probably up to the forum and people who gonna get interested, to decide..

As you already outlined, cost might be one factor with completed board but then again it offers other opportunities (like collaboration with china parts, for example :D ) and more..

--

Actually I kind of only mention Diy spirit and so on, as there seem to be some people who ask for 'ŗeady made package' so they dont have to spend a cent thinking which part to choose..

I wouldn't do it like that, I'm not liking China too much, except for basic stuff. I think reliability is the main point in a build. 
Talking about Europe, cells can be bought for about 90e for a 10s3p on nkon, spotwelding locally costs like 15e, let's add 30 euros for connectors, nickel, heatshrink, wires and shipping, it's about 140 euro got a battery that individuals buy for 300.
And we know it's reliable cause we made it. 
Motors: stay away from open ones, I would go for sealed. 
Vesc: Europe production would be good, but if needed we have to check the best Taiwan producer. Not maytech. 
As for random parts, those from China work just as well as they should, and as  @anorak234 said we could make a build for a very low price

We can get good sealed motors from BrotherHobby. And I disagree that we should just get basic stuff from China, just because the Europe group buy had shit batteries doesn't mean they're all bad. We can get them from the same place that SCP3 came from. They're a slightly higher price but high quality.

I'll find the place today. I have the manufacturer on wechat anyway, so if we need details they can get back to me today.

Sealed motors are definitely the best way to go. Prevents having to clean them. We'd need to get sensored too. Price for Bh motors is around $40-$50. There are also sealed motors from Freerchobby and they probably have the right sizes for us. Whether Bh only has 5065 I believe. And 6068

You go to school on saturday? Which Italy are you from?
Btw diebiebms unfortunately is designed with too high quality parts to be included in this project (example; just the wurth screwholders cost around 15€)

I usually go through the chinese internet and talk to sellers, actually just for curiosity and to review the language that I learned in highschool.

A normal wester person couldnt believe how low prices can go in china, and I am not talking about alibaba or taobao, these are made for western people and priced accordingly. To give you an hint of what I am talking about just think of the best deal you made of an used eskate part; the chinese target price for the new item would be half of that.

In a nutshell: 750 is totally possible for a dual drive, including a 150-200$ profit.

Cool! If we stick to 'diy' made board (made by many) you could maybe be responsible about the deck part!

Though it looks like u got some other skills on your hands.. so we just need to start attracting more 'talent' to see in which direction can this all go :slight_smile:

I think a 'Diy version' for Usa market might work quite well!

Especially if final price can be competetive enough with what is already available on the market (I know there are high end and low end - chinese boards sold through amazon. Not so sure about the middle group. 
_/ @ TorqueBoards might be in that category but @ chaka is probably above with their CarvOn /_

Alibaba prices are stepped up because of these reasons: license to stay on alibaba, fee to be among the first results, salary for somebody who speaks english, crazy high dollar-yuan conversion, crazy expensive mandatory bank account in Chase taiwan.
These add up to 15-20% increase on the price you get as a chinese customer.

Perfect then! 
Just to give you an example of a possible customer:
When we think about esk8s we think about young people, or not so young people with a passion for electronics, mechanics and speed, and casey neistat. 
Talking to my dad (who's a lawyer) I realised there are many people who don't need it as a hobby, but as a last mile vehicle instead. Those people don't have much time, have money but not enough to justify 1600 euros for 5 miles a day, and want the stuff ready. I haven't even taken my board on the streets yet, but I already got enough attention to probably sell a couple of completes if I build them. A compact eskate could be perfect for them, at the 750€ price point. Compact and carriable boards should be one of our main concerns if we want this market to go big

750Eur for a quality made board, does soung quite good!

I hadnt thought about it that far, primarly thinking about the first customers being close to diyers or diyers friends who just want a board to get around!...

Though, I would say that for a 'casual' user more work might be needed when crafting the right materials (info) in an easy to understand form (similar like many kickstarter projects get presented).. 

This is not impossible (to make and market 'commercial grade' board) just outlines the difference I want to make on how I understood 'future customers' of this board :)

I would say you are a bit on 'par' here with @lox897 who sees crafting a well enough made board would be the best way to do it.. (also to keep cost and price relatively down and low)

I'm not talking about anything big yet, but people here where I live like a lot when something is made by somebody they know/they've seen around. I could easily get stopped by someone while eboarding and get asked to get them a board like mine. That may seem easy, just buy parts and sell, but without stock and having to rely to what's available at the time isn't the best. Having an organisation behind could mean some kind of stock distributed through the small members who joined the group. And I wouldn't sell batteries made by me, I am not qualified (I mean, I've done mine but I had no other chance)  and I could get in trouble, so having a standard of parts to just connect through this small community would be key

@lox897 @Okami Thanks to both of you for the feedback. @lox897, yes it is a complete board but there is still several parts to consider, and main expenses come from the drivetrain and battery. @Okami I like where you're going with this... the DIY spirit is definitely something we could use to market considering that's what this forum is all about. Maybe we could use @longhairedboy's esk8.build domain as the website, and make it a custom kit thing. Like they get to go through and select parts (decks, drive type, battery, etc.) and we send it to them as a kit with some explanation and tools and a link to this forum so that they can build it?
[...]

Etc. Thoughts?
[/quote]

I missed your reply before.. but your idea is also nice! 

This way it would come together with @longhairedboy 'configurator' for the parts.. Someone would need to calculate total costs involved in shipping parts around.. 

Though, this might be more like Kickstarter oriented project already and probably (shamefully) we would maybe need to do some licence-ing. Im not even sure how these things properly work to be able to market on kickstarter level..

If we're gonna have a $750 board made by builders. Let's make it just as fast as any main board on the market (45-50kmh), and have 25km+ range. We've got to make ourselves look good. Just saying, this would kick the other boards out of the market if we can pull this off. $750 for a super powerful board is pretty damn good. Especially if it looks nice

Going with Vesc I think we cant go wrong on this :) Higher speed setups dont require that much bigger batteries I think, and we could always set up different modes, so first time riders dont go all nuts on +50kmh (30mph)

Here's another open-ended question: What to do with the profit? Obviously there's compensating those who help supply parts but what about the designers? Who decides who gets paid what amount?

-personally, my vote would be to put excess profit into research and expanding the industry instead of someone's pocket, but suppliers still need fair compensation and I just don't know who would have the rights to decide payments...

Well.. I would say it is hard to discuss this question at such early stage but thinking about it already now is wise..

Im not sure but at some point it might need to have an official organisation where all of these matters could be discussed.. but for now, while no parts and no money has come in yet, I think it is way too early to adress this.. 

_Any profit made should be decently / equally distributed among everyone who took part.._ 

How much each one would receive would probably be up to the main parties involved at the end of this project since they would direct the cash flow anyways.. **someone is gonna be there to click that purchase button anyways..**

I'd say for the first 20+ boards all profit would go back into the boards for mould costs, additional stock etc. Maybe each role would have an hourly rate in the future. Such as builders $20-30 an hour, or a payment per board. But what @Okami said, it's too early to decide.

With the current votes, it will be a longboard without a kicktail, all aluminium mount, underneath enclosure (much cheaper), sealed motor with sensors.

We are thinking a single 6374 motor which will be powerful enough, while making it easier to service and cheaper.

I will be doing a design today or tomorrow of the drive train with a cover over the whole belt to make it look cleaner. Deck shape input?

Micro drop (micro concave?) if possible.. though im not very experienced with different deck, so maybe create a poll for that now too, if possible?

Also depends on what choice of decks we get anyways.. and for what price etc.

As for motor.. I would still think whenever 6364 isnt better.. though, this doesnt matter as much, if it is shorted than turnigy 74 motors, which seem to be quite a bit longer than others.. :D

one little commment on the old Thread, then I go to sleep and BàM poeple all fired up. Love it!

I think we have a lot of good ideas already or at least possibilities. What the next step would be is to form a group, who is willing to meet and take on this project. Then those within the group should get "work" and every week we should meet and make an update how far we are in certain areas.

I think we all agree that lipos are no option and 25R cells (30q) are the way to go here. But we can keep talking components for ever. We need to find poeple who could put in the time, the work and even meet up once in a while.

We already have our own little 'work group'.

But at this stage it is too international :D 

So your idea still stands but before shipping out parts and assembling someone can still speak with part manufacturers / retailers and figure out the pricing and so on.

I've had 5 hours to think about this at school, so this is what I came out with
About money: I think we should organise it just like a group buy. One person from Europe, possibly Germany or somewhere like that, and one from USA (I say one, it may be multiple, maybe battery experts control battery shipping and production, motor experts check that and so on), get the money and buy for all. Not single parts, completes. Maybe a couple of options for decks, wheels or battery layout, but everybody gets nearly the same. The ones who do the shipping get a percentage of the whole, but still way lower than any shop/group buy that usually adds 50% minimum. 
Everyone who gets the parts establishes a local mini production site, just a couple of boards, and we create a Web throughout Europe and USA. If somebody needs something like this board (and somebody does), he just has to contact his nearest producer member and ask for the board. He will have the warranty of a good board because all parts will be the same, no margine of error. Standard connectors (let's say 5.5mm bullets for motors, xt90 for battery) so people don't rely on our own soldering jobs. Every single one decides what price to set. Maybe Germany will be higher than Italy because of market floating, or maybe you just want to produce one for a friend for a lower price. Nobody will keep stock for others for too much time, nor their money. 
This way, we should be able to get very low prices, divide shipping costs from China and have a reliable well known and trustful board. Everybody is happy and the market grows :)

I think we are going to keep holding onto this idea yes.. someone organizes a big groupbuy for all the parts, then parts get shipped out to the destination, where the assembly and control process takes place.

Then depending on Geographical Location, Taxes and other costs involved, the final completes can be sold further.

Still misses the funding part but once we get some designs and parts lined up ready to be ordered I think it will be a way better looking deal (also with responsible parties - at the receiving end in USA and EU, Aus, too maybe ? )

I think the best course of action would be to have a person organisie eatch individual part for a group buy.
So trucks, wheels, motors, mounts, pulleys etc. 
The good thing would be that we could get quite a big quantity with this project combined with an open group buy.
But I fear a little that poeple will love the opportunity to get cheap parts but will loose sight of the bigger plan.

I have an Idea that I will check. TLDR of that Idea: Got 4 poeple who want a board, I cann find 1-5 more I believe. Good thing about that they are all located in my country (which is tiny). So get parts here, ask 2 poeple of my squad who are expert builders and well educated on both the electrical engineer side and the business side. As soon as I have a price list of components, we then calculate the price with mayby a 50$ Fee per board assembly (crazy low I know, but sacrifices have to be made in the beginning) and then "sell" them to our friends/members.

As a beta production I think this would be awesome.

PS:" We have so much interest in our huge longboarding scene (localy) about esk8ts. Mayby we can get the complete Kit as a workshop:" build your onw esk8" and with the costs of that workshop, cover our expenses. Again, free thinking here, nothing concrete, but I think easily doable ( since I am in contact with both the scene/shops and the riders).

When we have a complete list of parts categories and parts I can throw a quick web app up that will allow selection and output a parts and price list. 

It would actually be pretty easy using PHP with a MySQL back end.  A big question is how to handle payment, PayPal is always an option but it's roughly 3% per transaction that will need to be accounted for.

yeh, Ive found about different transaction system and they are quite a bit cheaper! I think the one I used charged 1.5% which is actually tiny amount mostly. 

But maybe for 500usd transactions we can look around.. though i think almost everyone charges in some way either it is % fee, a stock fee or maybe even bad conversion rate between different currencies.

----
Im not sure about the categories yet @mmaner 
U might need to speak with @lox897 but for now he is away and not availble (part of Australian time?)..

We also had a part time deal with @longhairedboy but since it has been a while back he has not really given any response about the recent developments we have had on this.

It will probably matter most when part list is ready, centers for distribution and part installation are set and so on.

So yes, might need to wait for @lox897 input as I have not personally thought about webpage level yet. But we might surely need that later. For now we are just communicating on chat app, where instant messaging is possible + we have a google drive sheet for some of the 'part scenarios''- parts we might choose and for what reason.

Everyone please follow @electricboardbuilders on Instagram and Facebook. There will be regular updates on the Instagram page.

We have finished the motor mount design with idler pulley, and full 360 degree rotation. The (almost) final deck choice is the Jet Potato 33" , as it is a nice mix between cruiser and longboard.

Hey @oren , the battery has 324wh, so there is really no need for interchangeable batteries. It has 32.4km real world range based on the 10wh/km rule

so im confused as to what you guys are doing here. Are you manufacturing yourselves a board to be sold to someone?
By the way does anyone know where i can get batteries spot welded in Europe or buy them pre-welded for not very much more than the price of the batteries. I'm based in the uk

## \#130 Posted by: lox897 Posted at: 2017-05-22T09:59:14.092Z Reads: 179

We are essentially doing a big 'group buy' on all the components for a complete board. The parts will go to a US and EU distributor, then they will be sold by those 'distributors' and also the distributors will send parts to other people to build their boards from the parts and sell them. So eventually it will be a big network of complete board sellers. They can expand their options too by stocking other things that wouldn't be in the group buy. So this is an easy way to invest a little money and sell complete boards in your area. The board will be sold for $799 final retail price, with local area people getting it for around $650. So there is some profit for organisers, and all the associated costs. These prices are not final yet, but you will be getting about $150 a board for not much work. Everything will be plug and play, you will just setup the board and drill some holes.

I am liking the enthusiasm for this and am really interested in helping. I do have a couple of reservations though.. I don't want to put a downer on this however there are several limiting factors that you need to think about. A couple off the top of my head would be shipping and tax into the original country and then onwards to the 'hub' builders. This would rapidly eat into any profit from a complete buy. Postage within your own country of complete builds would also be hugely expensive and potentially difficult with the battery on board. Also there is the questions about legal responsibility, insurance and guarantees. 

While I agree that this is a great project I really think there is a great opportunity to create an all you need "kit" that could be shipped to buyers and if it really is as easy as plug and play then set up could be handled by a couple of videos. Final liability would lie with the builder in this case.

People who want to back the project would see a return on whatever the profit is per kit sold. IF people then wanted to offer to build up one of these kits and ship on then it would be seen as an additional service outside of the kit buying. Also trust me. Trying to carry stock is risky. You order 50 6374 motors and someone brings out a 6380 (or the fabled 63115 dual shaft) and you wont shift those motors easily. I think the beauty of this relationship could be a regular GB for all the parts needed.

Most people (not us builders) want a complete unfortunately - though the DIY 3D printing forums are huge, the profit lies in selling people completes - this is why companies like boosted are the thing people know about when you say electric skateboard. This does mean that if the board breaks, we will try and help the person and walk them through diagnosing the problem and fixing it. If it cannot be fixed by the customer it will be shipped back to the nearest builder and fixed. We are planning to have an EU and a US team that will deal with each of the two continents. There will be people in each of these continents handling the shipping of stuff from suppliers to builders and it will be shipped from builders to customers. Having two teams in separate continents should help us keep down shipping cost. Hopefully demand will be high enough that we won't need to worry about carrying stock! The motors we will be getting are sealed and sensored so if we do carry stock, there won't be a problem selling them. All of our components are super high quality so carrying stock shouldn't ever be a problem!

Fair points, here's how we want to solve those.
Taxes: for the most expensive parts, like batteries, we have a contact in Switzerland. That means he doesn't have EU fees on the big order. For smaller orders, the biggest thing is gonna be the motors, but i think we can handle that even if they charge some fees. Postage within Europe (always by ground, 1 week delivery) is under 30 euros max for each board (but a package that contains a board can probably contain 2, decks are what make it bulky)
Legal issues: as long as we sell a couple of boards we don't need to be a registered company. The ones who want to sell more already have a business, so they're ok with taxes. As far as our responsibility go, customers have to agree to be responsible for their actions while on board: Boosted does it this way. Warranty has to be given at least in Europe, that's why our first profit will go into local stock. Let's say i buy 2 boards, i get an extra motor and vesc to be sure i can repair stuff if anything goes wrong (we are going for trusted components though, it's unlikely that they'll break easily)
We don't order 50 motors hoping to sell those later. We buy just what we need to build and repair, knowing we have customers to sell our stuff to.

Any more US people to help with building? No soldering required. It's all plug and play. You just have to mount the components to the board, setup the drivetrain, and program VESC with a premade file.

So what's the business model?  

_Franchise_ 
Builder fronts the $650 for componentes per board then hopes to sell them for $149 profit?  
**_OR_**  
_Distributor_ 
Customer orders from website, components are sent to builder _based on region_, then builder puts together, tests and delivers to customer? _Splits profit with ??_

I'd be interested in the distributor model, (TX, USA) but not in a franchise.

So at AA Torque Systems we have majority of the tools to manufacture these skateboards and provide repairs to these boards, we have a team that can assemble up to 15 a week, possibly more depending on ease of assembly. I'm more than happy to help the community with something like this, and shoot we may want to take part in the group buy to bring the prices down on the Mach 1 series as well. @lox897

@SirDiff Unfortunately one if things my lawyers advised me is that no matter if you sign a release of liability, you can still be sued, also should be mentioned we have the insurance to cover us in the case of any legal matters. I'm not saying we shouldn't make people sign one, just won't have much merit in Court.

Yeah obviously that thing ain't gonna save us from legal issues, but maintenance of a vehicle is up to the buyer, like with cars. A board won't last forever, and obviously parts need to be changed before breaking. This is one of the reasons why we're going for the most reliable parts and we aren't letting single builders solder anything, those are little things that could save our ass. As a first batch we're just a group buy, which means buyers are buying parts just like a group buy, but we offer assembly too, not a company to sue yet

If you're willing to be a builder, I think that's an option. But I think the best option for you is to keep your business seperate from this. You want to be known for the Mach 1, not the Proton. I'm sure piggybacking on our manufacturer orders could help us both though.

So, in case anyone is wondering, we're still prototyping. The members of the team who have 3d printers and CNCs are trying specifically motor mounts, and we're arranging the pulley's production as it's the one that takes the longest (@Titoxd10001 has already done some group buys, experience is key and he's currently looking for the best manufacturer)  
The deck, as you may have seen, has already been chosen. @michichopf, who is an experienced downhiller, agrees with the choice of the Jet 33" Potato. He actually bought one for the prototype to try it personally and he was surprised by its capabilities. 
I'll try to keep you updated when we get any news :D

I indeed enjoyed the deck!


The deck:


It was obvious to us that we wanted a quality product that is well tested and holds up great, so we didn't even consider a blank china deck /clone. After a lenghty discussion we agreed on the Jet potate 33''. But before we made that decision final we wanted to test the board. As soon as we had a deck in our hand we had me as a test rider firs in a freeride/downhill enviroment. Soon after that I built our first prototype with the deck and tested it for weeks. After this whole process we feel confident that the Jet potatoe is a formidable choice. 


Here is why:

The speccs: 

- 33"

- tub concave

- ¼” elliptical micro-drop

- fender flairs

- mini-kicktail


The Jet potato is a smaller deck, but dont let its smaller size fool you. It was designed as a freeride machine for poeple who wanted a smaller board. The concave and the micro-drop lock you in tight so you feel safe and solid while gripping tight corners or hitting that throttel to its fullest. The fender flairs lock you in further and the mini kicktail allows awesome mobility in city enviroments. You have enough responses from the board so you know where your feet are at all times with makes the ride so much more fun. Those features are perfectly tuned for a deck that will be tunred into an E-board since they are functional but still comfortable and not overwhelming. It allows for a comfortable foot placement while cruising while having the functionality during some more serious sessions. For us it is the perfect compromise between comfort and functionality, between mobility and stability it is a truely awesome deck, whitch fits our criteria perfectly.

I'd like to offer my .02 on the color though: orange/black has been overdone at this point. For me it's automatically associated with Boosted and all the knock-offs out there. This board needs to have its own unique color scheme. I really like simple designs like the black/gray on the Blink S2. While I wouldn't mind having a logo on the bottom, a giant colorful EBB on the top ruins the aesthetic. I liked the idea of purple wheels and bushings though!

Quick update, since i see people are interested:
We moved away from black-orange color schemes. The idea is to go for purple-black for the first batch as a limited edition, and for eventual next batches we should be able to get original kegels in other custom colors (maybe black or grey with white accents)
The mount has been designed, 3d printed and tested, it fits perfectly caliber trucks. We are still deciding if we want an idler pulley.
We bought a sample of the battery, which is being tested these days.
Our tester for the prototype has been very busy with downhill events, so the promo video has been slightly delayed. 
The photos of the logo design on the board were just tests we shared to keep this project into this community, but we won't use those in the final product. 
I'll keep you updated as soon as I have news, just keep in mind this is working just like a group buy (but well planned), so waiting times are gonna be quite long. Don't expect to receive the board in 2 weeks, all thought this might still be faster than some builds in the end (mine took 1 year to get completed)
Stay tuned!

Right now, this project is freezed until Switzerland gets less snowy and we can get some prototype footage. We're also trying to finish a new proprietary remote so that we don't have to rely on chinese low quality stuff. We'll update you when anything happens

Everything was ready and planned out, parts/vendors/logistics, but no one had the funding to actually do the big orders.

What @MrHappy said. Some people dropped out and there was a lack of interest and no motivation as well.
