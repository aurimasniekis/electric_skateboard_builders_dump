Hello everyone,
I am looking to complete my 2 current builds. One of them is a street board build on a trampa street carver and the other is a off-road beast built on a trampa mountain board. I was wondering if any has/could print my htd 5m pulleys for either/both of these for a price of course. PM me if you do. 
Thanks,
Thomas
