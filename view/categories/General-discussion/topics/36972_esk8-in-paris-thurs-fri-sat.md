Anyone here from France or specifically Paris?

I am taking a little chunk of leave to drive through a small bit of France. Anyone want to meet up and go for a short (or long) ride? I'll be there Thursday evening through Saturday afternoonish. I already hit up the esk8.fr dude but I figure the more the merrier!

I just want to say, Paris is a fantastic city and super esk8 friendly. I esk8d from East of the Notre Dame all the way to the Pont de Bir-Hakeim (the bridge in Inception) and back on Friday afternoon. Most of the time I was able to use the bike lane and by the end of the ride I felt comfortable skating with traffic in the bus/bike/cab lane. 

If you ever get the chance to esk8 there, do it!<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/0/1/01981c29e1b17d92729b677a54dae1210ba31aa7.jpg" width="666" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/9/8/98b03897cc8928861ec564c73494aacf8e6bdddf.jpg" width="690" height="388">
