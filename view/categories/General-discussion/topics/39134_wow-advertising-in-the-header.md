I see we now have advertising in the header (of every page?). I thought we (eSk8 builders) was at least just pretending not to be commercially biased... or is that not a thing now?

Edit: Why has this been hidden, flagged. There is nothing here that brakes forum rules. It is a question pertaining to something new that has happened on the forum.

Who owns the forum? He's got the right to advertise, doesn't mean I support it tho

I guess my Adblock blocked the advertising. I wish it hadn‚Äôt though because if not for this thread, I wouldn‚Äôt have known about the $90 focbox and $30 controller üòÇ

They're rated at 60 and can really only handle a little more than 30 reliably.

@trampa :
What you need for a B-Friday V-6er? Looking to over-engineer a single-drive side-B*tch to make the main B jealous. Heard?
i'm thinking free for me, and I'll love you for ever. thoughts? (_sexual feelings_...?) make one irresistible, and I'll not only dump my girlfriend for it, I'll (be able to) pay for it too!

Deal, thanks

It all depends on the cooling of the Focbox..If you find a way to properly cool it, it will handle more. remember that 30 amps st 12s, is 1500w continious, more than enought for most people

looking on endless-sphere there's a thread about how it STILL says theyre in stock but they aren't.  People order and then wait months for something or their money back..and then it breaks.

Yeah it would be good to know if import fees need to be factored or if a EU depot would be on the cards for EU orders..,I'd double down but only if the taxman wouldn't be putting the pinch in

If you Eurotwats want, my friend is bringing a ton of eskate shit to Germany for me from california in the beginning of January. (including 2 90$ Enertion Focboxes inchallah)  Any extra small items wouldn't be a problem as long as it's not too many. would actually be nice for me too in order to hit the enertion free shipping threshold. Does everybody see the 97$price? so  many people talking about 90? In return you will have to answer any and all dumb questions if I run into problems with my build!

Hey I'm not giving out at all I think it's really cool of you, but there is another party involved which makes it tenuous/risky rather than shady, for instance if your buddy gets the goods seized.

In fact I have something coming back with @monkey32 thanksgiving trip.

I'd love to jump on a future wagon bro

Yeah worst case is him having to pay some import taxes thats true but luckily has never happened before touch wood. My brother is actually going back and forth between US and GER quite a lot so there will be future wagons. Only problem is that he only stays in fancy hotels so it might be kind of weird haven 10 packages from china arriving at the hotel desk :smiley:
