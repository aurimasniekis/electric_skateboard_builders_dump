As we know, a good electric skateboard may be specificated from different aspect:
max speed, mileage, torque power, weight, swappable battery, airline friendly battery design 

but it is not practical to have all the advantage on one board. 

then what should be the 3 MOST important features???

this discussion may be interesting.

Definitely "torque power". nothing else matters

When in doubt, torque power it to the maximum

For me. Quality wheels, good brakes and Torque

1. Reliability
2. Good wheels
3. Long range (trust me, it sucks when you have to go home early and everyone else can keep riding)

1.The Rider there are some people here who Sit on there skateboards and ride without helmets.

2. Power You could have Higher gearing for top speed or Lower for torque But nobody likes a weak ride.

3. I have to say the longboard goes before range because If your on a piece of junk that kills your feet with Vibrations etc you wont want to ride far.

Nothing like having one of your motors lock up at high speed to convince you that ‚Äúreliability‚Äù is the number one trait. The others are more subjective, but everyone wants a board that just works.

If it looks fast it is fast

If it looks Good it is Good

If it looks powerful it is powerful

The most important part of an electric skateboard is the skateboard 

Too often the actual skateboard is overlooked. Beautiful mechanical and electric systems... mounted to a flat plywood plank on knockoff trucks with crap bushings and generic wheels

I would say most important is reliability with quality sourced parts your build should be more reliable.

1. Reliability
2. Doesn't break down on the way to work
3. Rides through snow and brine without crapping-out
4. Resistance to breaking but not to braking
5. Built tough
6. Takes abuse
7. Won't street my face because it got brine on the ESC
8. I know that I will get to work on time
9. I can carry an armful of groceries and not worry about the skateboard breaking down.
10.  Reliability

Admittedly sitting or laying on the board is super fun, and really adorable when my fiance does it, it's truely best when standing!

1. Always reliability. 
2. Ride quality ie the board and drive train.
3. First build range. Second build lightweight and compact.
Torque doesn't even seem like it's an issue. Most available parts already accommodate for that.

It's not the board. It's the *driver*.

Approved :+1:t2: 
But only do it on bike trails or open areas. It was kind of stupid for me to go the sidewalk that time. :jack_o_lantern:
What shoes are those? My mom gets crazy every time I break on my pennyboard. :face_with_monocle:

SWAPPABLE and airline allowed battery will be really good point?
if battery is swappable, we can use more than 1 battery to extend the range, and get the board itself not in a super heavy. 
if build a big battery into board to get a good range, it will be very heavy. when battery is dead, all gone.
if i have 2-3 batteries, easy to change during riding, and it is light. and each battery is independent in living.

That's makes no sense in my point of view allow to elaborate on that. So let's say I have a 12s2p 30q batteries that are swappable, and I carry 2 other 12s2p it's the same thing as having a 12s6p under the board but 12s2p is only 40con , for airlines I allready gotten away taking it to the airport when I flew to Vegas, airlines just look at any documentation of any sort of the battery so I put a 150wh sticker on my dual 6374 12s4p  and it went thru no problem

None of that battery stuff even matters if your board breaks down.  Reliability is King.

None of that.  The way you construct it -- its vibration and brine resistance are the key.

Normally I brine my meats that I‚Äôm cooking and leave my board out of it. But to each his own I guess.

When it snows they throw salt all over the roads and sidewalks and it ends up a nasty black brine.  And it gets all over the electric skateboards.
