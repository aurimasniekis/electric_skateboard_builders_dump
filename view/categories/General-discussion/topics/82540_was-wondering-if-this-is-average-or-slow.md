I have to wait till I build a board that goes faster. But I'm 5'5 235lbs  and I'm not wobbly at that speed and a couple months ago I wouldn't get out of eco mode lol. So A lil more time maybe and I'll get even  faster. I've lost 30 lbs riding eboards in just 2 months and regular skaters don't believe it's a workout. Gtfoh

I personally think your board is fastish than average based on the numbers and your weight. I can only hit 19 or 20mph on my teamgee h5 and I weigh 170lbs 5'7"

It's a teamgee though. That sounds about right. No power. No speed. ;)

When I had my board set for AWD it may have went faster but I was not ready for it then and now I had to take my rear unit off and slapped it on my Wives board shes loving it but I miss going up 35% hill grades.

Its on the fast side of things when you compare it to other chinese prebuilt hub boards, most struggle to break the 25mph mark.  Afaik the landwheel is the only one that tops out at 27mph.  Off topic but how did you effect the awd set up on the" revel drive" was it?  Could you bind the remote to both drives or did you have to mate 2 remotes together?

I’d imagine that’s pretty fast for a cricket. 

I think it’s slightly above average for an eskate. 

I go 32mph max.

Just used one remote in each hand btw landwheel is Revel now. I just used reverse for the front drive and forward for the rear unit. Revel or landwheel is originally from China but the guy is actually trying to make good products and he does because bi love my Drives they are perfect for my fat ass

![IMG_20190119_202435062|666x500](upload://9dXgCYROFbCnOEx03AbVZ9Q2JCe.jpeg) 3 times the range. Tow charges the rear also because the rear drains a lil faster. I was going to try and splice the remote but I like having separate throttles after all

Being fast in one environment or with one track type doesn't mean being fast everywhere think you'd need to narrow your focus on some type of race or particular race also maybe search what average times/distance is or more detailed logs if anyone posts them (lots of people here gather/post logs).

If you're looking for straight land speed record think @MoeStooge is probably one of the ones to talk to (or look up) but if you are racing indoors or uphill or something then different requirements than flat land top speed.  Also stay safe, gear up for the inevitable crash because things happen, more confident you are more likely karma is about to bring you back down :slight_smile: (don't take this the wrong way, experience brings confidence too but don't let it inflate your head to being reckless)

Also check out if sidewalk riding is okay in your area, by me the police frown upon it :policeman: :frowning: because motorized thing on the sidewalk which in hindsight makes sense (it's not a wheelchair).

Not looking for the or a record just wanted to make sure I'm moving up the ladder ok. I just don't want to be slow. With these cracks and pot holes here in The HD I've learned to tuck and roll plenty of times. I even carry an extra jacket so it cushions my fall.  Can't wait for my ATB build ito be finished.

In Oak Park (Berwyn is where they stopped me) basically west suburbs of Chicago, they said since it's a "toy vehicle" with a motor it should be on the street. I was going sort of fast on a sidewalk but it was raining and there wasn't anyone else on that sidewalk, think in part they just wanted to check it out they asked a few questions checked my ID and gave me a warning basically.

I've been stopped here before and they asked where I was going.  I already knew the law here, so I told where from I came and where to I was going (normally I don't talk to cops, but I knew this law) and they told me to have a nice day and sent me on my way.  They told me as long as I was going somewhere and not just riding around, I was legal.  Which is what I also discovered when I read the laws.  But these laws only apply to the city of Saint Louis and not any suburbs.  So your results may vary.  Read your laws, and vote.

Good to know yeah I think legality with esk8 in Chicago (downtown) is a bit more grey area think not allowed in business district but that's basically everywhere (I might also be getting mixed up with quadcopter restrictions since I'm always looking into those).  Like people are saying in the reddit posts here basically the police look past it here as long as you aren't being a nuisance or giving them reason to stop you aside from the esk8

https://www.reddit.com/r/ElectricSkateboarding/comments/6xfq87/laws_in_chicago/

I personally don't ride downtown often since the train picks up and drops off close enough for it not to be worth it for my morning/evening commute, but I see one wheels and boosted riders occasionally and no one seems to mind too much (no one wants extra people on the streets but decent amount of bike lanes).

Those are my cruising speeds. It's fast but you can still ride relaxed. Above 30 is when I really need to concentrate and get into a tuck.
