And I see 6.5inch tires now too...going smaller little by little :smile:!

EDIT:
OY! I just read that the gummies are coming in spring 2018...right now it's a pre-order item.

I would imagine that the urethane would have to be a compression fit, or perhaps keyed to the inside of the hypa and superstar hubs. Otherwise there might be issues with slipping. Interesting to see!

Slip is no issue, The urethane is thicker as seen in the image. It reaches all the way down to the bed of the hub.

The 165mm tire took quite some time to develop, since its really really low profile and moulding got quite complicated.
The manufacturer and mould maker both took the challenge and finally succeeded. They have never done such a slim tire before. This was new territory for everyone involved. 
The weight is astronomic low for such a tire, keeping your board as light as possible.
In addition we developed a new tire tread, disintegrating towards the edge of the tire - speedy at the centre and very gripy towards the edge. It performs fantastic on all sorts of surfaces. We are more than happy with the result. In consequence they are in production and will be available as soon as humanly possible. We think this tire will set a new standard for cross over boards.

Tire inflated to 100 PSI:

Pre order a set! They will probably sell out fast. We can ad Pre-Oprders to the production volume.
We do not recommend to ride at 100 PSI, but we do our tests at that inflation ratio to assure best quality possible.

No, this is one. These tire are expensive to make and you need tons of very big moulds to make them.

The link I am clicking on to preorder is not working.

Whats the correct link to check out the specs and preorder the gummies (and tyres)?

I am not proficient in English, so detailed reviews here are difficult. 
But if you ask a question, I will answer you as much as possible.

Today I did a test ride for a while. Driving feeling was soft. 
There was no slip between the wheel and the tire. 
Soon, I'll shoot the video and share it.

I'll put a single one on the scales for you. 
The urethane we used is very special and can be very soft.
Rebound is as high as it gets with urethane. 
This is not the standard stuff usual manufacturers use for their wheels.

I'll push the product forward as much as possible.

308gr per Gummy.  For comparison: Regular Trampa 8" Tire with inner Tube: 309gr. 
153gr for a Hypa Hub 
187 for a Superstar.

Set on Hypa Hubs: 1844gr
Set on Superstar: 1980gr

At 125 mm diameter that is 3.96gr per mm of wheel diameter for a single wheel (on Superstars). 
That is 21% lighter than regular urethane wheels weigh per mm diameter.
If you use Hypas you are 30% lighter in comparison. 

Colours: Surprise Surprise.... Black will be part of the range.

The ride is nice and smooth, since we use a special formula for this tire + the cross section is a lot thicker than the appearance suggest. The tire fills the entire bed of the hub.

And infinity comes normally in black only... yet yours is white. Yours is powder coated it in white ;) did you strip the black paint off first? I have similar idea wasn't sure about existing paint. Tried paint thinners... no good... that's really on there.

It's about 108 mm (again due to the caliper precision). It makes sense because the thickness is about 9mm.  So 9mm + 9mm + 108mm about 125mm.

Nice Video! I hope you enjoy the Gummies. The BW edit looks ace btw.
I will get another set of protos next week to make  final decisions before we order the first bigger batch. The Gummies ain't easy to mould, especially not using the fancy high rebound urethane we made the first batch from. We need lots of moulds and they are not cheap, being massive in size. Once the thane is mixed and hot, it wants to be poured into many many moulds.

We ride them all day long. They perform excellent. The size is just right, I would not go any smaller. 
When you ride pneumatics you want that extra ability to ride on the rough stuff and chase the trails.
Worst thing that can happen is getting stuck from one second to another.
The grip is fabulous, much better than the pram style tyre pattern china copies over and over.

Good night, I'm interested in the question of why a small width of 50mm with a diameter of 125mm, because you can through the spacers to reach 80mm by 125mm, the grip will be better, the impact with unevenness will be less noticeable?

On the last batch we only delivered to pre-orders . Next batch will be bigger. Safest way to get some Gummies: pre-order them.

If you know the manufacturing process, you would know why different colors are painful. Once you mixed your material and heated it up, you need plenty of moulds to pour the soup into. Imagine a big bathtub full of hot, colored PU material. You need enough moulds to empty the tub into - in consequence all of your different wheel models will have the same color. If you ad another color, you end up with twice the stock, and it may affect your entire wheel product range. Three colors tripple your stock, now ad two or three shore hardnesses and different colors. If you order your wheels from a Chinese outfit, you can go for lower volume, but you need to accept the PU quality they offer. Monday blue, Tuesday green, Wednesday red, 20% rebound, 35% rebound etc. The (and your) moulds are all filled with the same low spec mass market stuff. 

If you want nice, expensive, custom high rebound PU you need a lot of moulds to allow emptying the entire fill volume of the machine. You are lucky if you have many different products to offer, having enough mould volume to fill the material into. If some esk8 guys want a certain wheel in a certain color, you can imagine how many wheel moulds you need for that  special wheel model. Moulds ain't cheap. 
Now you understand why wheel brands tend pick one colour for all their products - especially the high spec brands.

The new Gummies sit extra tight, we have made new moulds to assure a perfect fit. 
We have not seen issues with slip so far. 
You can stick two stips of griptape onto the hub if you fear that your hub slips (-;

Anybody have some reviews of how the ride compared to 107s and regular pneumatics?
[/quote]

Amazing compared to 107s... Lol

Also to answer everyone's questions about slip they are compression fit into the hubs. There will never be any slip. I've taken them up to 40mph and they don't chunk, and feel like clouds and are surprisingly grippy for 50mm contact patch

This is a very special German made urethane, which is formulated especially for this tire. It took us a while to find out how to mould it. The rebound is super nice while the abrasion resistance is really astonishing.

Yes @Szatyi and @trampa, you technically could on the Evolve super carve truck. Use [board bumpers](https://www.boardbumpersshop.com) Superstar Convertion Hub that will fit inside the Superstar rim narrowing its inside lenght and allowing the 32mm long Evolve hanger axle to work with the rim and mount a Trampa Gummie.

The Gummies will not fit properly to other brands hubs. They are designed to fit our exact hub shape.
I can imagine that this is the root problem. Try to stick them on one of our hubs. Always tighten the bolts in a star patter, not in circles.

it¬¥s a good option for people having trampa hubs and want to get some urethane range. It save a lot of money as you don¬¥t need to buy pulleys, sprockets or gear again for like kegel wheels, but they damn hard to compare with full urethane wheels. if you want soft rides than better go with popcas or tb110mm wheels.

Can't compare them to pneumatics, but coming from 97mm sooooft wheels I really like gummies. I think one should buy gummies not for a softer ride, but for ability to roll over more and higher things safely. Gummies for me opened a lot more terrain options, to the point where I would need pneumatics, and I'm considering trying some 165mm.
One thing to note tho, being a guy on a light side I did experienced that gummies are not insanely sticky and you really have to watch out while riding in rain with higher speed. Not the confidence builder.

Yeah this was my assessment as well they still have lots of vibrations and aren't that comfy, if the urethane was a another 5mm thicker this could have been a really perfect wheel, possibly the best you can get. Its still really good and safe as it rolls over anything but I wonder if TB110 might actually be better than this. Anyone who tried both?

I love them, i haven‚Äôt tried the 6.5‚Äù pneumatics yet

To be honest I hate big wheels, Kegels were perfect for me, that is if my city had good streets, with the Gummies I can ride everywhere, clear most of the cuts on the street for water drainage 

You will feel every vibration, every crack and rock, but they will not get stuck

If you have a really really, coarse asphalt it will be bad, like having to go 5 km/h or your foot will slip out of the board and your eye vibrates to the point that you can‚Äôt see bad

Another point I was surprised is traction on the rain and dirt roads , I don‚Äôt know if it is because they somewhat narrow that the water can easily be displaced to the side, but they grip like hell, in Kegels it was like riding is soap, with them I don‚Äôt even care

My take for them is, if you have average street conditions with some short really crap places they are perfect. If most of where you ride is bad, with coarse pavement they won‚Äôt do magic, in that case maybe the TB 110mm wheels will do better due to being wider and staying on top of the roughness 

If you want I can take some pictures showing some really particular places where they doesn‚Äôt do so good

As soon as I have my 6.5‚Äù installed and tested for a while I will compare, if I can get 80% of the range by running them at high pressure it will be a thought call, they will certainly make riding for comfortable, but as I said, low is better for me
