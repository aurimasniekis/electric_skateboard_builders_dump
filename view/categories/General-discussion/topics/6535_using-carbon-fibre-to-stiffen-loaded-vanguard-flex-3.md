# Using Carbon Fibre to Stiffen Loaded Vanguard Flex 3?

```
So i have been researching ways to stiffen the loaded vanguard board and i am wanting to use sheets of carbo fiber to stiffen it. I have seen another build where they used carbon fiber on top of the deck to stiffen it up.

Whilst researching i have read that putting carbon fiber on top of the board isn't very effective and is better to place it on the bottom. I would prefer to place it on top though.

Is this a a major problem. My setup will have the batteries on one side and the electrical components on the other so i don't need to stiffen it up too much, just enough so that when i am travelling at high speeds (25/28MPH) It won't affect the board too much.

Any help?

I don't think it'll be a problem.  2-3 layers of carbon cloth (200gsm)should add a little bit of the stiffness.

I also plan on adding a Matte Black vinyl on the bottom of the deck, would this work due to the flexy board or would the vinyl peel/rip off due to the flex of the board?

Do you mean the Strach vinyl film? Should be fine. It might get wrinkles over time I guess.

cause i was thinking of painting it matte black but i think a vinyl would be easier and more simple, (and may help with stiffness) I'm just not sure to reliable it will be over time and i don't want the paint to look cheap and tacky

Yea I used aluminum U bars which also held my battery pack. 

But now I'm over that deck it's terrible for e boarding. Worst mistake

It's expensive- use that money for something else on your board
It's too flexible - terrible for mounting anything at all
No stiffness- can't go too fast without reinforcing it or speed wobbles will kill you
It's a long deck- not terrible but not my style for city commuting


It's just not great. You can buy a vanguard style deck for 25 dollars that's stiff

I disagree on so many things, dont even know where to start. :joy:

@Raf did you ever ride it fast? I often ride 45kph with my flex2 vanguard and Ive never felt remotely close to speed wobbles! :thinking:

Im 165lbs and use a vanguard flex 1 deck. It is PERFECT, flex 3 would probably be way to much. It does require a little more engineering and skill to build on a flexible deck but i think the finished product is more unique and fun.

i plan on stiffening it with carbon fibre and making the enclosures on either end (like the boosted board). I think du to the weight and extra stiffness on the flex 3, it should be fine when reaching 25/28 MPH

There are a lot of vanguard builds on here with split enclosures be sure to look at them for some inspiration. That said i think you'll be fine, i can jump on my board so much it hits the ground and my enclosures are fine. Idk if i would bother with reinforcements honestly, but i have no experience with a flex 3 deck.

i am also very light and short (60 kg - 5"5 on a good day) so i think the flex shouldn't be too bad. Also the flex 3 type is a shorter board meaning the trucks will be in closer thus decreasing flex. So i think it should be okay

I have a Vanguard 42 flex 1 (i'm 265'ish - 6'8").  I've also done 2 boards now with GF and CF top and top/bottom.

I would absolutely add CF to both sides if you want to stiffen it up.  I'd start on top as well and if it still needs more - add another layer on top, or add one on the bottom.  Get some good epoxy, and get ready to sand sand sand!  Power tools are your friend to speed it up a ton.

here's the recent 33x10 i did CF top and bottom:

I would tape the edges to prevent resin going around to the bottom (pain to fix those drip/runs).  I also now put a dab of hot glue into truck holes before laying CF down to prevent them filling with epoxy (also tons easier to drill out later).

and my e-Sugar in GF (just the top to cover flat power wires):

another reason why i am deciding to go with CF on tp is because ill be running wires on the top of the board. but i may do both sides. 

what CF ratio would you say? and is it same for both sides or less for top/bottom?

I am thinking 1 layer on bottom with a vinyl over it and 1 layer on top, wiring, second layer, then grip tape. Is this a good layout or should i add more/less??

I  think flex 3 I'll be ok with your weight ( 60 kg) this my boats and is a flex 1 I weight 95 kg.

I would go with the wires on top, then a layer of GF or fiberglass - not carbon.  Carbon is conductive.  Are you doing round 12/10g wire or flat wire?

I'd check flex w/ just the one layer then add another on top, or on bottom.

not sure why you are CF then covering in vinyl?

@barajabali ok, you asked for it! :yum:

its not very expensive imo, you can laminate carbon & gfk without vacuum and you can tune a board to your liking for very few bucky imo! especially gfk with some resin costs nothing!

[/quote]
you buy a vanguard because of its flex and if you buy it, you know that youll have to do split enclosures. its hands down my best and most fun board and I had a few by now. but not only does it have a very lively carving nature that allows to adjust the radius with lean, but also purely with leg pressure (which is awesome fun), but it also dampens any cracks in the road to a point where I feel it wouldnt really matter what wheels I ride, because the board is taking care of it. this cool damping of the board leads to an improved grip on rough surfaces - while my tesseract & topspeed got less grippy and vibrated a lot, I can just carve over all these roads with my vanguard.

[/quote]
well yea, its not stiff, thank god for that! about the rest I feel like people are just chiming in with some general opinion that somehow made it stick. when I built up my vanguard I had exactly this prejudice in my head "oh god, this is probably good to 30kph and thats about it". but nope, I rode it up to 45kph and thanks to its large wheelbase, it rides very stable! I feel like there is NO chance of speed wobble at all, and I have really pushed the board, I have braked hard after full acceleration, Ive ran through bad pavement at high speed, probably got around 1000km on the board and never ever had a moment where I thought "uh ohh!!".

ok, at low speed that decks manoeuvrability is its only weakness in my eyes. if you cant work with your leg pressure on the deck to bend it during a turn, the turning radius is huge. and exactly that is the reason why you should NOT stiffen that board more.

youll notice that the stock board has **camber**, i.e. its bend like a banana with the middle being furthest away from the ground. when you stand on the board, it will level out and be nearly flat so you can swing around that point (like a cars suspension that also sinks in under its own load, so that the suspension elements can go both way from neutral position), once you carve and you push the board outside with leg pressure, it will actually bend further and youll have a rocker shape.

now, what that does is changing the truck angle massively. without load, the trucks are dewedged, i.e. the truck angle is reduced and your turning radius is large.

you stand on it and the truck angle becomes nearly neutral. now its just a long wheelbase with 50s calibers.

now when you carve and push the board out, the board bends, i.e. it looks like it has strong rocker -> the truck angle now exceeds 50° and makes the board more turny. under pressure I have the smallest turning radiuses of all my builds, without pressure the largest. :smile:

if you now stiffen the board up, youll end up with a camber shape which is not a comfortable stance (neutral/rocker is) and youll end up with an unresponsive board that has a trucks turning radius.

its the best board in my quiver, I really just love riding it! :hearts:


[quote="Raf, post:16, topic:6535"]
i am also very light and short (60 kg)
[/quote]

just leave the board as it is please, its perfect for your weight!! 

the flex will make for a great lively ride that will eat up most cracks and allow really great carving. if you split enclosures, mounting is no problem at all and you will add some mild additional stiffness to the board from that alone. 
if you feel funky you can connect the enclosures among each other and enclosure<->motor with wires on top of the board. maybe have a look at my vanguard build thread for some ideas: https://endless-sphere.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=35&t=80808

here you can see the 10awg wires sticking out - Ive routed channels on the boards top side:
http://www.alternative-4.com/DIY/vanguard_24.jpg

I sealed the top with 1 layer of GFK because I simply wanted to seal the routed channels and I didnt want to change/affect the flex.

you CAN go without routing and just use flat braided copper wire under the griptape, which is what boosted are doing!

cause  wanted a matte black finish on the bottom with carbon covered enclosures, kind of if you look up matte black audi, they have carbon hoods but matte black bodies and it looks sexy af

true that.  Though it's not super difficult to do a small channel to run them flush as well:

i ended up re-doing w/ epoxy vs poly, but the final looks good to me!

i like the clean bottom on this setup - not super amazing graphics, but just super clean.

Thanks for detailed response. I think i will ride the board first to see how it feels then decide if i want to stiffen it.

It is a bent aluminum bar to the desire shape and attach with 2- 3m screws to the TB motor mount. 

You can use one like this
