Today I broke my board, trigger just stuck at acceleration and board hit wooden door frame after accelerating just for 2 meters. Outcome ? Bended steel kingpin, hanger and base plate. I work on CNC machines and I know how hard is to bend good quality aluminium. I was Trampa fanboy for over a year, today I lost this faith. How come this even could happen ? Do you have similar cases ? And do you have any idea how to fix it ?

But can you confirm the wooden frame wasn't built out of mahogany from the planet Malchior VII where trees grow three hundred feet tall and breathe fire?

Ma.. hogany..

Very nice material..

Really expensive..

I guess in general this wasn't about distance and speed. It was how fast speed could be achieved, aka torque. With some boards I bet getting some insane acceleration is possible even in the shortest distance when you go 0-100 literally. :smiley:

I guess it also did some kind of a wheelie to hit the truck hard.

Shame to hear about the board pal, doesn’t look to bad. Take the hanger off and check that (it’s prob fine), kingpins will prob be fine too. Looks like the baseplate may be bent though. What is the bushing it the middle ? Looks different ?

Pretty sure that’s a titanium kingpin. Wow! If that’s bent. 

Has the metal bushing you’ve added made an imprint into the aluminium? If it has that won’t help either. 

But yeah, don’t think the kit is to blame here. Get in touch with Trampa. I’m sure they will help you out with replacements.

I second this. 

I once bent down to turn my board off when i arrived at work . . . had my remote in my hoodie pocket. My street carver shot off across the office, grazed a wall, flipped over and spilled lipo's across the floor.

I made a post because impact was not that hard but damages are like I drop board from a building. Im disaponted in materials.
And all my fault was that nano x stuck at acceleration and not respond to breaking. You otherwise was blind and hit your flex car by your fault.

Seems like that's what youre doing here.

2. You accelerated your board into a solid object
3. You have no pictures of the damage (which means the after pictures are actually the before pictures)
4. You made a post here blaming Trampa for your mistakes

```
Physics, lever effect
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lever

It crashed, the wheel which was more forward acted as a lever mostly bending the baseplate.

It's not really a weakness or an indication that the truck can't take heavy riding over heavy-going terrain.

It simply means that you can't full throttle into door jambs even from a 2m distance. It also means that if you like getting air & if you are heavy and/or don't land cleanly you risk bending one of both parts of the truck.

So stay on the ground and don't play with the throttle indoors unless the board is securely placed. A throttle which sticks or drops is no good, you need a safe throttle & you need to go to Trampa and pay for replacement parts, struggling to see an RMA in this case. 
https://www.trampaboards.com/baseplates-for-spring-trucks-c-471.html 

I'm sure @trampa could tell you more if that doesn't cover it

Ps. Since you have access to machinery then you should be able to straighten out either maybe with a vice or a press. If you heat it the tensile strength will improve but it will be more brittle and of course the powdercoat won't survive.

I would buy one new baseplate and if the hanger is slightly bent I would straighten that with no heat  in a press, if I had access to a press

If you wanna quote me, do it right and do not manipulate like a BBC reporter.

Brenternet:
1. since when nano x is a shitty one ? I know it is not the most reliable but for about 8 month was good.
2. Not me, i just slight accelerate to move board, then nano x stuck.
3. Are you kidding me ? what I will accomplish doing that ? After I come home I start to disassembly board and check whats wrong. Pics of board was taken after an hour of bending back kingpin and checking the rest.
4. I blaming poor materials, since when Titanium got magnetic properties ? (what is this alloy, because it reacts to magnet?) And if you work with duralumin you will know it is not easy to break that easy. 
5. Try Ksylitol, much better for health and teeth :)

P.S. post about shitstorm was about last time mutantbass shitstorming in Kaly topic :P

[banjaxxed](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/u/banjaxxed) Yes you right about lever. I check this door today, it is made from a cardboard so it bends like it, the most damaged part of a frame is softwood (6 layers of paint on it are more hard than it) But the main part of a frame must be made from Mahogany...expensive one :) and that part damage truck. 

Still i expect more from Trampa, but I STILL love the design and feeling of ride.

P.S. 2
I really, REALLY want to be pure physics (and my bad luck) and Trampa are rigid as hell, I love it to much

The funny thing is if you had handled this like an adult, I would have replaced your truck out of pocket just to keep another esk8 rider on the road and inspiring others. 

The logic goes like this;

1. you ran your esk8 into a wall, and
2. trucks are not designed to be run into walls,

I’m very sorry that you took offense to my dumb-ass post. It is an earnest attempt to help you see that, perhaps, there’s a bigger reason why nobody is really behind you.

We’re here to share ideas, support our community of builders directly (they all seem to appreciate fans yet only actual money pays their actual bills) and, finally, helping other members get started in esk8, so they will later support our builders.

My mistake. I hope you are successful at whatever it is you’re trying to accomplish with your time in this thread.

We all share a common passion for boardsport - and it is perfectly normal to get angry when things go wrong.  I’ve wriiten things here that I regret, too and it goes without saying that we have a responsibility to each other. If something is defective, yes, we want to know. 

I ask that we all, myself included, try really hard to remember that when we publicly tear down our builders in our community, we are in fact tearing down what brings us together.

I think we need a good reliable remote. Sorry enertion, but sometimes your quality control sucks. How is it possible that there are people with remotes that have problems with broken charge ports and stuck throttle knobs.
From 7 remote, I have 1 with a broken charge port.  2 with a broken on/off knob and 1 with a throttle know that stuck. That is  4/7... that is more then 50% off my remotes. Some off them are only one week old. And charged 2 times. 

Btw: sorry to steal your topic.

Its funny... I run the nano remote... Its been rock solid even though its flimsy plastic and cheap.  Only mod I do is open them up and stick a two sided tape in them so the parts don't rattle.  Accidents I have are all related to either someone else syncing to my board or me shoving the remote in the pocket while its still on

Do you mean control channels? Or radio frequency?

Control channels- one, throttle. No aux
 
Radio frequency- 2.4ghz mcss. Their radio modules are on a different level than pretty much anything other off-the-shelf.

The problem is the quality off the components that are used in the remote. I have no problem for paying 50 euro’s more of the quality is very good. I want to use a remote 1-2years not 1 week. + after 6 months those lipo’s inside the nano x are puffed that I must buy new.

Said it before and I will say it again.  The remote should be one of the most expensive parts of the set up.  Its the only thing seperating the concrete from your face or indeed your board from a wall.
For some reason the industry doesn't put as much quality into its remote design in general.  The price point has been set and now we complain if they rise above this.  
Would you fly a $5000 drone and camera set up with a cheap ass chinese controller?  Why then do we trust our lives to them?  Big hole in the market for good bullet proof remote/receiver sets and hoyt seem to get this.  Money well spent however expensive.

Nowhere did i say ppm wasnt viable. I just responded to someone that clearly was looking for something better and offered my opinion. I own 4 nrf remotes. Vedder has a bunch of em in different iterations as well. neither of us ever had any problems. Not sure what fight youre trying to pick. I have a few ppms as well, but theyre on the shelf.

Why, you haven't given any reliable benefits as of yet.

That statement alludes to PPM remotes DO fail, which is not any more true for PPM than any other remote.

Did they ever fix the cold temperature issues? I know you regard the remote highly, but thats a big issue for some :( 

Id love a puck... I just want safety features... ala feather remote :(

Might have been abit unclear, ive ranted about this before so I might have been abit short.

My personal experience and judging from others as well, its quite safe to assume that some (not all) ppm solutions have issues. These issues i have, again personally, solved by using nrf instead. 

The benefit would be that after 4 years of use, i had zero problems. (the extra features are nice too ofc)

And Id say that my statement can be interpreted how ever you wish, again personal experience and I know im not alone. Not sayin all ppms have problems or is indefinitely unreliable.

This was an issue from the Preassembled boards not in the DIY community. It affects the cold start pairing of the board and remote wasn’t already paired

No, Im almost positive this affected the puck. In fact I remember something about (pardon my bruteness with technical terms) a thermotransistor being out of temperature range

Response to user form hoyt in the edit of the post for the lazy:

> Hoyt responded and said they recently found out that the board stops connecting to the remote when it gets cold. So they acknowledge and know about the issue

But this can be isolated to a select few receivers.

Note: That this is not for the interest of damaging hoy’s sales as I own two receivers and a remote myself.

yes it was 'isolated', but I dont check the topic much so this might be fixed, who knows :man_shrugging:

I don't have one but according to everyone I know who does they are a solid unit.  That cold issue affects most remotes apparently.  Something to do with the crystals.  Above my paygrade though and living where I do its a non issue for me.  The point was they have put together a very good quality unit which performs much better than most and for that you have to pay a premium which should be fine considering how important the remote is to any set up.  
My futaba rc remote cost me 400 bucks.  Range is awesome never drops out and has no cross interference issues.   I paid this gladly for running a model car so why wouldn't I pay the same for moving me around?  Lot less painful when you experience failure during an rc car race than hurtling down the road on a plank of wood.  Personally i use benchwheel or maytech because they have been the most reliable so far but still have issues that a bit more investment could cure.

Would be great if that would be true. I had a very bad fall a few years back with Benjamins open source remote like you can read on the [Vedder Forum](http://vedder.se/forums/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=248&hilit=warning&sid=1cba9c3a99829de5988df9937ff085b2). (Sadly the forum is somewhat down and you can't read everything posted there) It wasn't just a disconnect with losing the ability to break and accelerate, but it accelerated to full speed without any option to stop that. A lot more scary than anything I have heard about PPM remotes.

No need to pay $400 to get a solid connection.
The futaba 3PM-X costs around $150 and comes with the most dependable system they ever made (FASST). I had it before I got my $400 4PK-S and apart from the extra features the connection is the same.
I said it before and will say it again.
All esk8 remotes currently on the market are a sorry excuse for a remote, especially one that our life depends on it.
I wish Futaba or some other reputable manufacturer (not you Spectrum :rofl:) came out with an esk8 remote.

This is kinda off topic to the thread but I'd like to clarify some things.

Re: Hoyt St
Honestly that issue only presented itself to a small handful of people, it had nothing to do with the remote but I've seen all sorts of misinformation. 

It only ever impacted production boards being turned on below or around 0C. It was an issue with the PCM and had nothing to do with the remote at all, it was just reported as a remote issue because *users* turned on their board at 0C and the remote wouldn't autoconnect. 

I personally looked into this for Hoyt St with another engineer to determine the root cause (he actually found it ultimately). It has nothing to do with their remote, DIY users won't be impacted. It was never a 'connection dropout' issue, it was an issue at cold start up that wasn't giving enough juice to the receiver during initial auto-pairing. Nothing that impacts ride time. 

The Hoyt St Puck is the best option on the market right now in terms of reliability and robustness. It's a gold standard in my book, and I'm currently designing my own remote. I highly recommend theres.

Full disclosure: I do not speak for Hoyt St Electric. I am not officially affiliated with them and receive no compensation for any sales. They're just local to me and JJ is a good friend of mine. ;)
