hi my 48v ebike controller stopped working from tests it seemed to be a blown mosfet.although the controller had only been used a few miles with my 1000 watt front hub motor.i tested motor with my dual esc controller on my longboard and it span up ok.i have ordered a beefier 45amp sine wave controller off ebay.the faulty one was from alieexpress and they havnt refunded so will stick to ebay now.does anyone know if my dual esc controller that comes with remote control an ebike with a throttle.my battery is 54v fully charged 14s5p samsung 25r cells.i tried to replace mosfet on faulty controller but my soldering not good.the motor span straight away when connected power then went off with no throttle.
