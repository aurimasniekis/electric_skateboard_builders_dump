Hey everyone,

I'm waiting on some parts from eskating.eu and I've not received them yet. No response from email etc. I know they had fire on 15th May but saw from their Instagram that they're starting the ball rolling again.

Just want an ETA really of when my stuffs due to arrive. I ordered a motor, motor mount, wheel pulley and motor pulley. I think it's the pulleys that's causing the delay because I'd imagine they've got to be made?

Has anyone ordered anything recently and heard anything from them?

Cheers,
Daniel

@fottaz

He's working hard to get everything shipped out as soon as possible, I guess your goods will be shipped soon :slight_smile:

@e.board_solutions it's horrible what happened to them. Fingers crossed they're starting to catch up!

@brenternet That's good to know. When did you order your goods and did you get anything made? Just trying to judge when mine will arrive that's all. I'll continue to support them for sure! I'm buying in stages :slight_smile:

Nothing custom, which likely helped with speed, 5 days from order to shipping and arrives tomorrow in the UK.

Before the fire I ordered some stuff and it took months and months and months to ship, then when it arrived, they were the wrong things.  Just use a different vendor

This is strange, they are not a "backorder company". I received the stuff in 3 days, I am in the same country though.

My whole kit order from early April shipped today so I wouldn't worry. He's just super busy with loads of orders and the accident sure didn't help. And making batteries, enclosures and pulleys especially takes time unfortunately.

The best way to keep track of what's going on is to check out Alberto's instagram stories.

@b264 if that's the case then I won't be ordering again, sadly.

I'm hoping it won't be much longer. If it's the pulleys that's causing the delay I'd rather get a refund on those and buy them elsewhere. Also ordered a motor and motor mount.

I'll watch Instagram etc but eventually if it takes too long I'll have to ask for a refund :frowning:

My experience with Eskating.eu is that Alberto always hustles to get the orders ready asap. 

Delivery has been speedy and on point every time, but pulleys might take a few days extra. 

I know he's been buried in work lately, but hopefully he'll get back to you sooner than later. Contacting him directly through his site or via email might help.

@fottaz is the most helpful person I encountered in the industry! Even though I contact him in the middle of the night, he takes the time to respond! Even if something would be wrong, it's possible to fix! I recommend that you contact him via instagram or whatsapp!

Wtf? Ever since he is on the market i heard good things about him and saw a lot of progress on his instagram and it's just not fair for you to  slam him like that. He is selling good stuff and is one of the better vendors in EU. And i say that even if i didn't bought anything from him. 
He is expensive like everyone in EU but one mistake can be forgiven right?

Maybe so, but I got the wrong pulleys, many months too late, and extremely rude customer service.  I just ended up remachining the pulleys myself because I didn't want to talk to @fottaz any more to deal with a return or replacement.  That's just my experience.  I was quiet about it, until someone asked if anyone else had similar experiences with them.  I have.

I bought from Eskating several times, never any issues and shipping has always been quick. 
Eskating is a great vendor, don't worry :slight_smile:

I can understand wrong pulleys but i'm always against bad customer service. That's the only thing we can hope for in this market!

I ordered parts there multiple times, always had my parts within about a week and customer support was good.

Hi Daniel, very sorry you're totally right, I'm honestly super busy and more everyday is passing, if you are the Daniel I've seen on order of late may, from UK, I'm.near your order to be shipped.
Unfortunately I'm still be alone working for every single order, and it's taking so much time handling shipping parts, but also going on with battery packs, kits and beasts in the meantime.

After the accident things went just worst, as I cannot work for almost 2 weeks. Also restart was hard I have to say, was a mess.

I'm doing my best and trying to focus on dispatching orders more than replying to emails, I have to do it.
If is the one of late may, I think your order should be ready within this week and ship early next!

Sorry for the inconvenience, I'm not for slow service, but it's not my choice I'm just amazingly busy. 


Ps WhatsApp is the fastest way I can reply almost of time!
Alberto

A note to everybody: if someone cannot wait the time I need to dispatch just ask for a refund so you  won't  waste  time, I really prefer it instead of stress people and me at the same time ‚ù§

I won't spend any other word with him, and he already told everything (with something more that what happened in the real world). I think he was just waiting the right moment to explode like he's doing, we just don't like eachother I think

Hi @fottaz,

Thanks for responding. I think that would be me as I made my order late May.

I'm sorry I had to post on here about the order but I tried to WhatsApp you and it wouldn't work (the link on your website wasn't working when I clicked it?) All I wanted was an update on the progress. I'm not massively urgent for it but I like to be kept in the loop :slight_smile: 

I'm sorry for the accident and I hope you've made a full recovery.

Thanks,
Daniel

Sure you are in the loop üòÅ you'll get the confirm and tracking asap! WhatsApp logo has not a link, you can just write me to the number you have seen there!

Everything fine after that bad day! Very appreciated thanks!
