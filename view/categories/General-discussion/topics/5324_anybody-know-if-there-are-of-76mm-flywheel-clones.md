Does anyone know where to to get 76mm  ABEC 11 Flywheel clones?

I've been able to find 83mm and 90mm but not 76mm
I want to do an experiment and I'm not willing to take a chance on my originals which are getting harder and harder to find

If you can't find any you could try to make your own pulley for Landyachtz Zombie Hawgs. They have holes in the core.
