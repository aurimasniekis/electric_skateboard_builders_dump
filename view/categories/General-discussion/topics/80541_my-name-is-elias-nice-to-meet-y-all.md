It was my first thread, so I was trying to be stiff and scientific, but I inadvertently pissed some folks off by suggesting some cheap parts could replace the high quality parts manufacturered by members of this community. I still think it's possible to lower the cost on some things and still achieve the same quality, but that's not the point. I'm making this thread as a kind of apology for my dumpsterfire of a thread and to make peace with y'all. I love esk8ing, and this is the place where lovers of the sport come together to create their dream boards. I couldn't miss out on that, no matter how bruised my ego was when I was told that my business classes have no standing here.

Anyway, let's start fresh. My name is Elias. Nice to meet y'all. I hope in the future we'll get along. I'll be posting some 3d printing stuff, and eventually my "Cheap Beast" build (not as cheap as I hoped). I'm coming from a recently broken Ownboard and a slightly modded Alibaba SYL-08, so you know I've got a lot to learn. All I request is that when I say something dumb, y'all shit on me with a little less diarrhea, ok? üòÇ
I'm starting with 2 Maytech 6374 170kv motors, a skateshred drop down deck, and some airless AT 6" wheels. Lets see where I end up.

That's why Meepo did the flashlight in the remote thing. Personally I rarely ride at night, so I would rarely use it, but hell if I don't have a stupid bright light on my board to not get hit by shit drivers

Also, I might just forget I was even holding anything in my left hand and accidentally drop itüòÇ

Just looked them up. 3d print may not be necessary if they can tightly fit the light. Doesn't seem like it would hold it securely enough though.

I got this flashlight and I'm really happy with it:
https://gearbest.app.link/rnn5ghW8nT
It has a 18650 inside and easy to recharge.
The 18650 can be replaced if you would like to put in a better battery (I replaced it with a samsung 30Q and putted some glue inside so it won't vibrate)
