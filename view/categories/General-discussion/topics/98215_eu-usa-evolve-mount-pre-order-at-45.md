Hi guys,

Many guys have been asking me to make evolve mounts for 63xx motors so I made them and are in production now 

As usual Iâ€™m doing a pre-sale :slight_smile: Itâ€™s 45 euroâ€™s for a pair instead of 85.

You can find more info here: https://electricboardsolutions.com/collections/ebs-core/products/evolve-motor-mount-pair

Finish will be same as the matrix II mounts
