I've been debating whether or not to build my own board over buying a board off the shelf. After a few months of research and working out how much I can afford to spend I have decided to build my own board. However I know next to nothing about building a board. I'm also wary of LiPo batteries in particular charging them. The space cell from enertion looks fantastic but I'm not a huge fan of getting stuck with hundreds of pounds in taxes and duties. If anyone has any idea of good places to get components I would be hugely thankful.

Enertion has an Eu warehouse. The manager @nexty is on the forum. Perhaps he could shed some light on shipping and duties to you.

Hey, I'm having real trouble sourcing part in the UK.
So far I have: 

1. Caliber 2 Trucks
2. DIY Aluminium Motor Mount
3. Deck

I need to source 
1. 36T + 15T Pullys (I think thats what I want... Ill be running 10s Lipo and a 6372 170 or 190KV)
2. I need the belt too.

Ill use Kegel wheels from Amazon
Ill use an Alien Power motor
Ill use a VESC

So I guess its mainly the pullies that Im finding difficulty sourcing. ProtoBoards are sold out.
Any ideas... eBay!?

A list of places in the EU I have found that sell motor and wheel pulleys.  All have there own version so pick what style you like best.
