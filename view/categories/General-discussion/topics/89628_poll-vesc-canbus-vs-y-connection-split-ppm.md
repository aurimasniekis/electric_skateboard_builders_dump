Hi guys!

I know there are other threads about wether to use PPM or CanBus on a VESC (4.12) when running multiple motors. I just created I poll to see how many of us prefer one against the other :slightly_smiling_face: I'm trying to figure out what to use on my new setup and I'm curious what you guys like best!

Vote in the poll in the next comment üòÅ

For all of you that want to know more about this topic, there are other threads on the forum with a lot of great comments, so there is no need to ask any technical questions here. They have most likely been answered already :wink:

Thanks for voting! :smiley:

Thanks for all the votes! I'm going to try the can-bus and be very careful when I do it to make sure everything is connected properly! I'll return with my findings when the second motor and vesc arrives!
