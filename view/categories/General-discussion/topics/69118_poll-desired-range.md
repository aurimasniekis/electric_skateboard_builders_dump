[Edit] I closed the poll given that the selections were way too big.  Will post a new thread.


How much range do you guys generally like to build for? Purely out of curiosity 

[poll type=regular]
* 0-10 km (0-6 mi)
* 10-15 km (6-9 mi) 
* 15-20 km (9-12 mi) 
* 20-25 km (12-15 mi) 
* 25 km + (15 mi +) 
[/poll]

All my boards have 20+ mile range that is the minimum for me and even with that I get range anxiety. I honestly feel more comfortable with 30 mile range so I can ride faster and have more fun on the same distance trip. To some people this may sound like a crazy range or excessive but I'm really heavy and I do long group rides where we ride fast so my requirements are different than others.

Hey man what did you get out of your evo with the 12s4p?  Curious is all as thats my next construction.  Practically identical to your one.  Oh and I'm heavy too 230lbs and ride like I stole it.
Hoping for 12-15 miles

Interesting, is the long range because a lot of us are riding for fun instead of for transport?

My commute is a 20km roundtrip.
I have a second charger in the office but what happens if I forget to charge, or have to leave in a short notice or have to pass by somewhere else on the way home?

20 is ideal. Group rides are always in the 10-15 range but if itâ€™s ride, recharge, ride again. A drained board would not get back to 100% quick enough. So the less I have to top off the better.

I get more than 30 miles from my Samsung 30Q 12S5P on thanes and that is with hills and top speed runs thrown in.
Say goodbye to carrying your charger when you receive your battery.
I have ordered some six shooters (among other things as you very well know :face_with_symbols_over_mouth:) and I am worried how much range I will get.
You could say I have become spoiled with the range I am currently getting.

But at least you'll look fly as hell walking your dead board with that @psychotiller hat on. Lol

I'm pretty sure what you lose in range is going to be outweighed with the new comfort and smoothness of your ride on those 6shooters

I don't think range would be that much different than on six shooters than 107s plus the weight I recall is the same as big thane wheels too!

Me too.
However let me tell you about the last time I had to push my dead board.
Imagine having planned to ride around this lake on my board during this summer (total distance 28-30km )

![IMG_8612|690x294](upload://mgtIpxDJCJBvt7IxTpD83fdpoxe.jpeg) 

![20180818_194940|666x500](upload://vw5QeRFzbSBk65wheGeR4mI8NyG.jpeg) 

![20180813_141914|666x500](upload://AaXDWUsrHLE2oxPg6LCczGHcLec.jpeg) 

![20180813_141822|666x500](upload://4MagwFEvWmSKnULBMQrNoFk2PoE.jpeg) 

Then the board breaks down 7km away from home, your wife has left her mobile phone inside the house and she is outside in the garden and you have to push an 11kg electric beast wearing/holding all your safety gear (TSG Pass, motorcycle jacket, TSG SK8 DHP kneepads etc) under the sun at 30C while every living creature (ducks, swans, cranes etc) in the lake is laughing at you (either that or it was the heatstroke :roll_eyes:)

Next year I am doing it (pneumatics or not) and if I don't make it, you will fly down to Greece and push me back home :rage:

So how do you get to the group ride, then?  

You'd need at least 10-15mi more than that, or do you carry a second board with you?  I've been guilty of that before

On the 12s4p 30q battery I was getting 18-20miles range riding hard and 25+ cruising with old enertion mounts and really tight belts, now I have an idler set up and run looser belts and I see 23-25mile range riding hard and 30+ cruising. 

That battery will now be going on a DIY evolve Im making with dual 6355 and Focbox. Now on my next battery that's going on the Evo it's a 12s8p should easily have 50+ miles range on 107s

So how do you get to the group ride
[/quote]

Here in California. We have this thing called a gas guzzler. Where we sit in a slow moving parking lot called a freeway. I live 50 miles away from family and because the grandparents wants to spend time with my daughter, I do this thing called driving every weekend. I tried to convince them to skate but that didnâ€™t go very well. ðŸ˜‚

Thereâ€™s no way to get around driving here. Yes, I drive to the group ride location. Most normal people (in CA) do

I like to have at least 30 miles of range. As it stands it means I can charge, and then ride and not worry. Even if I forget to charge, I can change my cutoff voltage and get another 10 miles as a safety net. 

So basically I want range because I'm lazy. Ie I don't want to have to think about charging it, or have to bring my charger anywhere, unless of course it is out of town travel..

Up until now I had not thought of keeping an esk8 in my go bag :slight_smile:

I have a friend who has a 12 mile board.  We are always limited by his range.  My board is about 26 miles, which is a lot.  For me 20 miles is the sweet spot.

wow, place is beautiful, where is that?

i've got a short (< 10mi), mid (20mi?), and long range (30+) board.

but also have an outboard 12s4p pack in a small pelican case that i can parallel to any of said three boards and instantly get an 550+ additional Wh.

it's fun to fit a giant pack but it's also not fun lugging around a 25+lb board.

I've got 10s5p Samsung 30Q, on dual 6374, running 107s. I'm 95kg and run at pretty much 75% to full throttle all the time, except to slow down for pedestrians etc. I get  around 15 miles before cutoff at 25%. No real hills of any type, just gentle gradients at best.

Does this sound about right?

I see others posting 25 to 30mile+ ranges on GTXs for example and think either they're bullshitting or weigh 50kg dripping wet or something. 

If so my next proper build will need to be 12s6p at least because a) I need to go faster, and b) I could easily last longer...

Yes.  You can learn how to ride in such a way that the battery lasts 3 times as far though.  It's all about riding style
