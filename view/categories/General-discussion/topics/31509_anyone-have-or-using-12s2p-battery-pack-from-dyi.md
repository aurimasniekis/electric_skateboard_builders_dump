Hi all,

First time poster here and was wondering if anyone can help.

I recently got the Meepo board and want to upgrade the batttery. And I found 12s2p pack from DYI site but if possible I want to hook it up to Meepo ESC and motor and see how it runs. See how hot it gets and if it's viable at all. I contacted Kieran, the maker of Meepo told me it should be possible even though it could stress ESC a bit. So, if anyone near me (San Bernardino, CA) has the pack and kindly let me hook it up to the Meepo ESC and motor, it would be awesome before making the purchase.
