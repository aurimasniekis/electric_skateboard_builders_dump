All,

I am thinking about buying a Boosted board as my street e-skateboard.  I currently have a eVolve Carbon GT with off-road tires (I enjoy it).  

Need some advise.

Is it a good idea to buy a USED Boosted Plus.  Found a used one that is 1 year old for $1000.  Owner claims it has only 20 miles as he doesn't use it so he wants to sell it.

* Is it worth it?
* Is there a way to verify that it really only has 20 miles.
* If a Boosted board is charged and stored and not used often... does the battery degrade?  My understanding is Li-Ion battery needs to be "used" or stored at 20-80%.  
* How do I verify the battery is good?
* Does Boosted really give the flexy carvy feel compared to the eVolve Carbon GT?
* Would I regret not have the power of Boosted Stealth?

Any advise would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks.

Ask for screenshots of the boosted app, or a screen recording of them showing the date on their phone and then entering the app... Just to be safe. 

The battery could be dead, or it might not be. Ask to take it for a swing around the block ðŸ¤· 

Don't forget your helmet!
