Hey guys, well my room caught fire when I was charging a lipo battery, any support would be appreciated because I lost all my esk8 stuff in the fire. Here’s a video of the damages

Any donations would be greatly appreciated because I’m going to end up paying for my mayham. just started working less then a month ago and need to somehow collect 5k

Dumb question, but if you're charging a lipo at a standard amperage (2a is normal for like ion, I figure it is for lipo as well) will the battery deform over a significant period of time? Or is it a <5 second type of thing

It's a visual warning sign sure, but there are plenty of other signs that someone can check if they really care enough about their cells 

Lipo or liion :man_shrugging:

Cell level fusing doesn't protect in the case of overcharging since it has constant low current, but overvoltage on the cell/group. Not sure if that was the case in this thread, but it seems like either that or pack failure which is what i'm leaning toward.

Usually the cell just dies. limiting the pack voltage. Or you burn through a series connection. limiting the pack voltage or cutting it completely. Small burn marks from the melting nickel but hardly an explosion. And if the insulation is worthy enough the rest of the pack will be fine.

What is it that makes BMSs mostly fail? I'm thinking of wiring my (soon to be aquired DieBieMS) to do both charge and discharge... But if the heat generated through discharge isn't good for it .. then I'll just bypass :slight_smile:

Sometimes electrical components fail. Resisters? Fets? Drvs? Then, maybe a p- group keeps bleeding off charge until it hits a level that isn't touched by your charger anymore. The other groups will take on more charge to complete the charge cycle. If you are missing 5 cells in a 40 cell pack, this is a big problem.

10s3p with a p group that was drained to 0.3v
[/quote]

I had that issue with my 12s3p pack, I noticed cut offs and lack of power in my board. I decided to look at my board with thermal camera after a ride and looked like a P group was way hotter than the rest of the cells, I thought I was going to burn down my car, house of office. I took it to Psychotiller and found out the cells were at 0.0V. DEAD as can be. Those cells were replaces but pack still had some weird issues. I think it might've been the BMS, finally got the swapped out and seems to fine.

I highly disagree that they are the best option! In fact, they rarely hit the 80a discharge cut off and temporarily shut your board down at speed. Then restart it while you're goofing around with the throttle.

All a bypassed bms does is monitor levels while charging. does nothing anyother time. as long as you arent pulling too many amps, (climbing a hill-AWD-full throttle-80a per motor-10s5p-max battery set at 30a per motor)  DONT ASK HOW I KNOW

You won't have a fire.

As about the the guy who had this misfortune.. would be interested what charger did he use..

I know of a drone battery fire.. where charge mode was set to bulk mode.. but  cant rely on that 100%, as there also was a chance of physical damage to the cell.. but who knows.. if he had enabled balance charge, charger would have stopped sooner. (in drone guys situation)..

So yeh.. hard to guess just from pictures alone :D all it says now: LiPo Fire!

1. Never leave the room if charging in/at home. 
2. Prepare a fire bucket (halve sand filled) or/and have the lipos in fire retardant bags/box.
3. Have a plan for quick disposal ie get them outside fast and as safely as possible...this is what the bucket is for.

no comment on the reason behind the fire?  or the condition of the lipo being charged?   Looking at your past for sale threads, most of the stuff you were trying to sell looked sketchy at best.  I wouldn't be surprised if the cause was trying to charge a damaged/puffed lipo.

I think this is an important reminder that there are risks in Esk8

For obvious reasons I think KaramQ may be reluctant to give specific details on what happened to cause the fire. Sounds like he is already in a heap of trouble with his parents and considering the extent of the property damage to the unit there may end up being an insurance company making inquiries as to the cause.

Considering how frequently you see people asking about how to cheap out on a battery pack reminders like this are good. The community seems to have a pretty good stance on protective equipment, if you can't afford it don't ride. It would be good to see a similar stance on batteries, can't afford a good BMS or a properly built battery then you can't afford to Esk8

Oh man, lucky you that nobody got hurt.
If I see things like that it always bring me back to the fire I had just half a year ago.
We couldn’t stay in the flat for about half a week because of all the dust and smell.
Luckily it was still warm at this time and we could leave the windows open all over the time and had a 3 weeks vacation after.
The smell of lithium dust was still present for about 4-5 month. You can still smell it sometimes, but it’s like close to be gone for now.

I highly recommend everybody who charge any kind of batteries to get some fire blankets

https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/bEhFAKrC

They are super cheap and you can through them over the burning pack. 
Yes it will not save your flat from all the dust and dirt, but limit the flames to a very small area.
Along with the blankets some gallons of strong salted water or better sand or a fire extinguisher against electrical fires are as well never bad.

All in all it was a pain in the ass to get things clean again, but as I was prepared the 11s4p pack damaged only a cell phone big area on our wooden floor.

Just always be prepared for the worst and have a plan what to do.

Hope you can get back into esk8 sooner or later @KaramQ

we all make mistakes, especially early in life...i rolled my parent's minivan when i was 17, totaled it.

in all fairness $5k in damages for water sprinkler going off isn't horrendously bad.

it's a tough pill to swallow but getting a job, just grinding it out and paying it back and quickly as possible is probably the right way to handle this.

anyway, let us know when you've got shit back on track, i'll chip in some parts so you can get back on the road.

This is just silly.  You blowtorch concrete and you are likely to lose an eye.  It explodes.  Trust me on this.
@KaramQ dude sorry for all the crap you are no doubt getting from your parents but that is a learning curve my young friend.  Lipos should never be charged outside of a lipo pouch.  Period.
Never ever charge a lipo or indeed any battery unattended.  You charge while you are in the room and never leave that room with out first isolating the charger from the battery.  Basic safety shit.  We of a slightly older persuasion may have safe areas where we can be a bit more blase about but you in an apartment with other people need to be a bit more vigilant.  
Hope you continue to skate my friend.  I'm just glad that no one was hurt.

I still don’t understand why so much guys are charging Lipo without a safety bag.

Way before this hobby, I was riding RC cars. I always charged my Lipo inside a safety bag and a sort of ammo box. And If it was good weather outside then I was charging outside. 

@KaramQ if your parents don’t want that you make new boards... tell them that you always gonna charge your boards outside.

Definitely not true, Li-ion batteries have valves at the positive side just so they don't blow up, they can be mechanically damaged pretty bad and even then they don't  tend to blow up. Li-ions are a lot safer than Li-POs! I short circuited my battery pack the while making my first build and really nothing happened, after that incident I included a fuse so even theoretically nothing can blow up.[15523801011705026768384044001204|375x500](upload://pVqEG5sCYFFQVKYm7rcfv6Ff7Nj.jpeg) 

Made this battery pack myself (with spot welder) 10s4p Samsung 30q cells. I run a single SK3 Turnigy 192kv motor and i have up to 35 km range. Beast of a board. I made it budget variant and this month I will upgrade pulleys, enclosure, motor mount so I can enjoy it and it doesn't break down so often.

That’s again not true. Sorry for that.
There was a member here had just the same thing happened not long ago and it was a LiIon pack.
I also can find you as min 3-5 other people from here which had a thermal run away with there LiIon pack.

Please consider the fact that LiIon packs have way much more places where things can get wrong. If people don’t know how to build a proper LiIon pack (which is unfortunatelly more often the case than most people think) than it’s definitely way more dangerous than lipos which you can just wire up with a serial or parallel plug.

Experimenting.  Howwwhaaaaaa haaaa haaa.  Not intentionally.   ( trying to squeeze a big battery in a small place with compression connections..and guess some became detached). Routing the deck for more room and safer design with bigger contacts today


Seems could’ve gone much higher
https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20120002724.pdf
Been meaning to go to higher voltage in a controlled environment to see what I can get to or how big an explosion is possible.  According to most 18650 cell manu testing and the data posted they shouldn’t go into a fire ever with high voltage and it’s supposely the multiple cells beside each other that multiplied the heat and that’s the cause

In the conclusion of this paper it states you should be aware that you shouldn’t do more than four cells in parallel because (something like)” all the current will flow through a bum cell if one of the 4 is bad”. Doesn’t make sense to me

I disagree.  Lesson learned is need to have enough room to fit the batteries with a decent sized contact.  Not .8mm. I’ll be using bands still and trust a band more than I trust...anything.  The band is so simple how can it fail.   And then with room for two bands..

All up to you man, 12s seems like an unnecessary upgrade if you're going for a build that focuses on range, but since you're using alot of power it might be worth it for the lesser heat generation(at similar amps) and the boost in torque and speed. Tbh I can't say for sure, as my 12s is being build as we speak o3o

That doesn't look like "5k" worth of repair.
Also, unless you are being forced to use contractors (e.g. renting, heavily government regulated or something), you personally could also reduce costs substantially by learning to patch drywall and do the painting yourself. It doesn't look like the electrical conduit is involved in the section needing repair, and if it isn't, that would simplify things.
Don't know your age, but anyone mid-teen and above can do this kind of repair work and it develops skills you may find useful, even enjoyable...later in life.

Ceiling repair can be a bit harder, depending on the materials.

Glad you, yours, and the house as a whole are ok.

He isn’t mad, just overwhelmed because technically, it wasn’t my fault, the battery was on a balance charger for less then 10min, that balance charger definitely did not work and I believe my dad is going to take action against the amazon company which sold the charger. He actually didn’t want me to quit esk8, he is just not a fan of me building them. My mom loves the idea of esk8, but hates to think of the components of it. Literally a week ago, I was configuring a vesc and my mom said; “sooner or later your going to burn the house down with your projects.” I should have seen it coming and listened to my mom. End result is I’m only allowed to work on my esk8 stuff at my uncles welding shop or in my balcony. They didn’t force me to quit because they figured it was my passion. Thankfully, @topcloud is helping me get back on my feet and I’ll be back in buisness in a week to two, depending on how fast the contracters work.

I know I'm late to the party, but I can tell you, if an 18650 goes up, it goes up. I have never had a lipo fire but I did have a 18650 fire. Yes, it was my fault for the battery assembly mistakes. But It doesn't mean 18650's safer than lipos. Both are extremely dangerous.

Well I think looking at the situation, it's a misleading reality we live in. Lipos almost never come with a bms. Li-ion on the other hand almost always comes with a bms. And we all know that charging is the most dangerous state of a battery. So one has charging protections and other one doesn't... It's no wounder lipos go up more often then li-ion...

Yes and no... Not everyone uses balance chargers. I've seen a lot more interest in meanwell power supply's for charging lipos.

I think it's just hard to compare and say for sure, this one is more dangerous. Lipos have been widely more popular over the years in drones, rc cars, rc airplanes, ect. And there's a million videos about them blowing up as a result. Li-ion is still much newer, and not used as frequently in high discharge, low weight situations (like the areas I listed above). Maybe I'm wrong, but I've seen a couple 18650 fires on here for eboards and this is the first lipo fire I've seen. Even if there's been a couple other ones, it's really hard to determine a relationship with danger, as it could just be the end users fault and have nothing to do with the battery chemistry.

Most people, especially in the hobbies you mention, charge with a balance charger. It's not also chemistry but the way the packs are physically constructed which contributes to their safety. The metal casings on cylinder cells vs the rolled like a fruit roll up style on lipos matters.

Exactly what I was about to edit into my post. This is lipos inherent flaw. But that's on the manufacturing side. Yes, lipos blow up and li-ion just blows out the end caps like fireworks. But discharging is not the place I'm most concern about but charging.  IMO, both are dangerous. The real solution is solid state batteries, but who knows when high discharge, high energy density solid state batteries will exist :confused:

Life was easier in many ways then, No cell phone bills (got that when I was 19), no internet (got that at 18, AOL) and definitely no esk8.

I can't imagine being told I CANT work... Jesus Christ :man_facepalming:

I was clocking 30 hour weeks during school weeks as soon as I hit 16, young me needed that bread 😂

I think if you look hard enough you can absolutely find a service that will accept you. Sure it might be manual labor, and it might sound like a good thing now, but the general consensus is that working hard while you're young and grinding out the hours will make you more appreciative of the jobs you'll have later on, as well as teach you valuable life lessons about the workspace

It's a boatload of effort, but what else can you do? 🤷

The only other young person on here with an income is Greco, and as far as I know that's all crypto... So that's a dead end :(

Remember to find a balance. I'm guessing your parents will be ok with accepting part of the financial burden so your GPA and school life can remain intact.

Kinda glad somebody's finally said something about the donation thing. I didn't want to be the dick to do it.

I'm 20, almost 21. By the time I was 19, I was over $75,000 in medical debt. Guess what, it's still growing like crazy. I also can't work or even finish school until I have two major surgeries. I didn't ask for this shit, I kinda really miss having a normal life. Anyways, I haven't asked anybody for shit, nor have I ever had anybody give me handouts. I've literally slept on the street in Rochester, MN, (was there for a hospital) after a shitty slum motel fucked up my credit card stuff on their end and I had to wait for shit to get cleared up. 

Anyways man, I am really sorry about the fire and the situation. It sucks. I do not however think you have any right to be asking for handouts, or linking to any form of donation place for yourself on this forum. Not sure why mods have allowed it in this situation. Maybe I'm a dick tho.

Nahh. You’re not a dick... maybe lol. I know the kid personally and he is a great guy. Although I feel horrible, im with everyone else anout asking for a handout. If you explain your situation and someone offers to help its one thing, but @KaramQ is a healthy young lad who is not dumb by any means necessary. If you can hustle to get them wheels, you can hustle to get your esk8 stuff back on track. Llus working at Target will give you a discount on pants

Conclusion is I’m only using lion battery’s, not an offroad guy and don’t need lipo, if you guys use lipo battery’s please charge them outside your house unless you have some type of furnace or fire blanket. I am the result of misuse of a lipo, please supervise your lipo!!!!!!!
