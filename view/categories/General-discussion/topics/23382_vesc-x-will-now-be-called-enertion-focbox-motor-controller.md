**VESC-X will be now called "Enertion FOCBOX Motor Controller"** OR simply **"FOCBOX"**

In accordance with the terms published here: http://www.vesc-project.com/trademark_policies_page

Enertion Boards PTY LTD will no longer use VESC on any products.



Over the coming weeks, we will work to update our website & marketing materials in accordance to the guidelines.


----------


**Some commentary on this topic for those interested.**

I personally believe Frank (Trampa) & Ben Vedder (VESC project) are working with the best intentions to ensure the best possible product is made available to the community. There is nothing easy in this world & they are both putting it all on the line and working tirelessly to make an amazing product. I applaud their efforts.

Whether it is a popular decision or not, the steps they have both taken to protect the VESC name are a very positive sign for the esk8 industry, it's a sign that our beloved industry is maturing & becoming a legitimate industry that's worth investing in & protecting. 

All the Vendors, Small to medium business & Larger business that supply goods & services to the Esk8 community should be proud of what we have built. Together we are better & the consumer ultimately wins in the end.

Finally, If you don't agree with a particular vendor or company strategy, motive or ideology the best thing you can do is spend your money elsewhere. Arguing or complaining is unnecessary, the market will always determine what the correct decision was/is and the results will be undeniable.

This hardware is not VESC, it's a FOCBOX 

however, we are using the VESC firmware/software so if we want to describe that somewhere in our marketing copy we must write FOCBOX with VESC® Software


we will continue to link to the source on the product page, as we currently do

Didn't it take months for BV to get his trademark. How were you able to do it this quickly? Also wasn't it super expensive? trampa always says how much money it cost them to get the TM for BV.

I have no idea about TMs so I am genuinely interested how the process works.

hahaha that's the best name ever. 

So now we're all a bunch of FOCcers? 

Here's some clever marketing for people who like to run it in various other modes:

FOCBOX. Not just for FOCing.

So what the FOC is even in these things now?

Hi Jason, I will tell you all my opinion about what Trampa did and what is happening about the Vesc name. It was made by Ben, but I think it was made for the community, also because it is open source and every shop that sells Vesc said that donate a part of the money to Ben, if it is true, I don't know, but I think that the exclusive use of the brand "Vesc" for trampa is something that is not very cool, but what could we do?

FocBox is an Awesome name, it literally says "Our product don't burn in Foc mode"

I really appreciate you Jason, for creating this Forum, for everything you did to start a Diy Electric Skateboard Community, you was my hope to don't spend 1500$ in a BoostedBoard, I need to say, Thank you!

Ítalo, Brasil

It hasn't even been a week and I can see how confusing this will be for costumers who are new to the market.

I guess I need to jump on board and change the name of my app. I think that people should be able to use the word VESC, as long as it has some other sort of identifier, like the X in VESC-X. Name's should tell people about a product. FOCBOX tells me nothing, VESC-X tells me it's a variation of a VESC. VESC Status tells people that your going to see the status of your vesc, whether it be a VESC-X, VESC 4.12, VESC 6, ect. VESC is a generic term, and I don't see how anyone besides trampa benefits from this. What term can I use now that refers to all of the variations of the VESC?
```

i'm starting to wonder that myself. On one hand it means that there will be a flood of newly branded ESCs to choose from.. on the other hand they'll all be basically the same under the hood. It could potentially cause a race-to-the-bottom scenario while the groups of less scrupulous vendors compete for customers on price and start to cut more corners. Maytech for instance selling only 10S rated 4.12s with sub-par components. They told us they were tested at 14S. Maybe 14S LiFePo for about 10 seconds... we cooked our samples in 15 minutes flat. Meanwhile the X's, Ollins,  and older Enertion PCBs are still going strong after months of the same kinds of abuse.

What I can see is that theres a problem with everyone who sells VESCs 4.12 not using the original BOM, but selling under the same name as the original. Not all VESC 4.12s are the same BOM, so any variation should be forced to change the name slightly. I think if some guy creates a VESC-ABC, and it sucks, the community will learn that the VESC-ABC is bad, and avoid it. But I don't see rational people associating the problem to vedder or the VESC. How can me using the word VESC to describe my app hurt the image of the VESC?

If someone makes a slight variation of a product, using 90%+ of the original product, forcing everyone to rename their stuff will result in mass confusion and products that aren't accurately named to inform the customer what they are really getting... I would never accociate the FOCBOX with a VESC, even though most of it is still a VESC...

It cant, but if a 3rd party can co-op the name VESC, they immediately have brand recognition.  Additionally, if they can keep you from using the name VESC they can stop your brand recognition which in turn increases the chance that they will get the sale.  Its pretty sleezy in practice.

And that's what I feel like is happening... People will associate the VESC only with what trampa sells. We have all put work into that name. It's actually the community that named it the VESC, not even vedder. I have written articles, compiled data, and built apps for the VESC. I have put countless hours into helping shape the brand name of the VESC. Now, I can't get any of the benefits brand recognition, of a name that I have contributed so much to propagate? It feels like trampa is sucking up all of the hard work of the community, cuase lets face it, the VESC would still be in the stone ages without the community. It's because it's been open source, and widely shared, that it has progressed from nothing to the eskate community standard in less than 2 years...

That's what pisses me off, he didn't actually do any of the work.  Its guys like @onloop & @torqueboards that developed the VESC market and guys like you and @Ackmaniac that developed the aftermarket.  

I didn't do anything except burn up a couple trying to figure out how build bad ass rocket boards.  I will claim that in spending my time and money, doing build logs and talking to people about methods and equipment, I have done my share to increase the use of the VESC in powered board building...but so have a thousand other people, all of which have done more than Frank.

And that's my point. The entire community gets shitted on by trampa, because they have an opportunity to make a quick buck. They can say they spent x, y, and z on it. But at the end of the day, it's an investment for them, not some favor out of the kindness of their hearts. They saw an opportunity to make a quick buck, not help the community. Because this doesn't help anyone but trampa.

I feel your pain brother.  It's disgusting.  You have some vendors/builders who do really great work, make innovations and offer them for a reasonable price.  Then we have others that come in just to make a quick buck and no worries over who they screw in the process.

I finished up an data/study app for a customer about a year ago.  Still haven't been paid completely, and just found out he sold it for 2mil.  The new owner is calling me to get changes.  My response has been "sure, as soon as I get paid the last 2 rounds of changes".

I just hope that BV is not aware of how this has been handled and is going to get involved at some point.  I cannot imagine that he would condone this.

I actually just today bought a pair of ves- uh, Enertion FOCBOXes! Gotta get it right, I might just start calling them Effs for simplicity's sake. 
Anyway, I may have been one of the last to buy them before the site was updated, thus they were still called the-box-that-shall-not-be-named.
And since no one besides you seems to have made a joke yet about "the box-formerly-known-as-" I'm just gonna put it out there. Well played sir.
Edit: apparently I went to enertion.com without thinking, saw at a glance it had changed, and assumed...
yeah, they're still called... y'know, that other thing.

I really agree with the sentiment that members of the community have made the VESC what it is today.  My first VESC setup was awesome... for two years ago, but nothing like my board today.  @Ackmaniac and his firmware changed everything for me.  Better acceleration control, and better braking make a better VESC and @Ackmaniac's  contributions were possible because the VESC software is/was open source.  Benjamin deserves credit and reward for his contribution to our little industry.  I just want to say thank you to all of the rest of you that contributed as well.

Whilst I do 100% agree with everything you are saying, Sadly it's just not how the business world works.

Marketing a business (or product) & Building brand recognition is similar to playing a game of chess. Trampa are positioning themselves to try and win the game (as any for-profit business should), but this is just one move and the game is only just beginning. I suspect there will be more moves to come.... think software restrictions.

I must say that I am VERY surprised that "VESC" was able to be trademarked. The trademark attorney that processed this application obviously didn't do a thorough search or have an understanding about the mark being used as a common Verb, or its origins! So without opposition (yes we all could have opposed this), it got approved. But it doesn't matter now it's done!

Furthermore, anyone could have trademarked the name VESC. Beto, the guy who coined the term could have, I could have done it, you could have too or Maytech for that matter. So at least Ben Vedder has got it now. I think that is probably the best situation.

> **So moving forward, Ben Vedder now owns VESC and we can't change it.** Yes it is true that various vendors have spent THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS marketing that name and spent countless hours writing articles & doing tutorials and basically running a gigantic beta program to iron out the bugs! ...
The value we, the community & vendors, have created for that brand is HUGE! **I would estimate the VESC brand to be worth over 1 million dollars (pa) in terms of brand revenue**, for a few thousand $$ it's now owned by Ben Vedder (which I think is very fair payment for his work so far) - Ben has achieved this thanks primarily to the guidance of Trampa who are hoping to benefit financially. Frank would not have spent coin if he didn't think it was a good investment!

>  **THIS IS BASICALLY WHY PEOPLE ARE PISSED OFF**




----------

**So what do we do now?**  Do we sit around crying about it? no point doing that.

What I intend on doing is putting my energy into promoting **FOCBOX** because it is protected we can invest with confidence. We now have control over our destiny and we have the ability to succeed or fail without impacting anyone else livlyhood.

**This is actually an amazing feeling!** 

I am not a gifted electronics engineer, nor am i a coding genius.... but i am no doubt one of the most successful business operators, Sales & marketing specialists in this industry.

So for me, this situation is perfect! I love building brands from the ground up & I believe FOCBOX will soon be renowned as the premium & affordable solution for DIY esk8 builders.

We will also be offering some exciting deals for resellers who want to get involved with the FOCBOX brand. 

There will also be OEM opportunities for vendors who need hardware manufacturing support.

You hit the nail on the head here. It really is an opportunity for the community and for you in particular, Jason. A good marketing push will make the name VESC a distant memory. Right now Trampa is bumping the price to cover R&D costs. That means that those building on the open architecture can still produce a similar quality product for a lower price. Combine that with a decent marketing approach for a different trademarked name and Trampa could be left holding a big bag of nothing that they paid for. The question will be whether the software and other hardware innovations still remain open source and shared or will they close the doors on that in the near future. My bet is the latter, but time will tell.

Edit: BTW, you need to update your website. No FOCBOXES to be found

Benjamin needs the Mark, that is fact. No intentions to play funny games, locking stuff down, creating incompatibilities etc...
Relax, sit back, no worries.

We, Trampa will probably never sell the cheapest HW, we take what we can eat, not more. We specialize in top shelf stuff....
Expect to get what you pay for....

I hope the funding situation for the VESC Project will get a bit better now. 
All vendors and users should think of supporting Benjamin as good as they possibly can. He put a lot of effort into the new code and there needs to be some fair renumeration to keep up motivation. You have absolutely no clue how much work it was!

I'm glad some vendors also see the chance to build up their very own brand, based on good reputation.

a TM application in Au starts the ball rolling at just over $100, by the time it is gazetted it is close to $500 if you don't have objections. This depends on the mark type and class(es). From there you can apply to the "madrid protocol" for mass application in other markets or you can apply to each one individually. Au is small the cost is low, bigger markets often cost more... I have applied for a little over a dozen marks with a TM attorney and filled 2-3 times that my self.

The Au TM search engine [ATMOSS](https://search.ipaustralia.gov.au/trademarks/search/quick/result?q=focbox)

Once you apply you can claim the TM (pending), but it will take at least 6 months or so...
