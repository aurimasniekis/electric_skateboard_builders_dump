So iv everything but my alignment dialed in ..but the belt alignment is causing me huge issues from belts breaking to speed wobbles and just making an otherwise ready to go board which has taken months and months to get to this point unrideable.. help please üôåüèª
Video of the belt (the mount is not srewed down as the alignment needs be right but iv no idea how to get it correct..)

u might need to flip your motor pulley.. i cant see that good from vid. What diameter belts u got broku? for me i try to get the TB mount as close as possible. Also, with single motor i had issues similar to what your describing, i think it was one of my main issues i found was my breaking values were too high, but even then i still had some problems

I thread all 4 screws until tight and then back off 1/8 turn, put the wheel and belt on, tighten the wheel, slip the belt on both pulleys. The last part takes a little fiddling‚Ä¶

Put the hex key in the outermost screw, pull the motor back until you have the right belt tension then back off about a 1/16 in. Tighten that one little bastard of a screw you‚Äôve been trying not to knock the hex key out off :slight_smile:.

Pull the wheel off and tighten the other 3 screws, put the wheel back on and test the fit.

You will lose that 1/6 in you backed off when you tighten everything else up.

Not sure if it's just me but your wheel pulley doesn't look like it's uniformly mounted. Like some bolts are tighter than others so the pulley is effectively wonky on the wheel.
Check the spacing of the lip is uniform around the whole wheel

Due to pulling the belt towards one side you can see that the left side of the belt looks quite worn (fibers are well visible). Maybe try to fix the pulley alignment w.r.t. the wheel ...

I had the same issue with my TB mount and pulley. I just adjusted it so that when the wheel spins in the normal direction the belt has space to run freely without rubbing. Since i never ride in reverse this was a non issue. I also had the pulley reversed like you since my motor's shaft was quite short.
