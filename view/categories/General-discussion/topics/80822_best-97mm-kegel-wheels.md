Lined up a pair of APS 6374's along with dual 4.12 VESC's and a 10s4p LG HE4 Battery Pack
Last parts of my first build to find are the drivetrain and wheels

Currently I'm thinking of a FatBoy Nano with a set of Kegel wheels

My question to you, the community is what you think is the best set of Kegel core wheels that are 97mm or greater?

Cheers

The constrictors look amazing, but I'm not super keen on the red :frowning:

and you can count those out since they're no longer made in labada (though the 97's never were if im not mistaken)

Leaves 2mm ground clearance

Too close to the ground for 97s?

Well its up to you to decide if 9mm from ground is too close :slight_smile:

otherwise 90's would be perfect for this build :frowning_face:
