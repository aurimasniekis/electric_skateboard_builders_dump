I am making a build with 107mm wheels and was going to get a deck with cutouts and dropped through but then I saw this bad boy and couldn't resist.

I've never used risers on a non-electric and with my e-boards, I have never needed more than 1/4" and even that was being very generous. 

It seems that for this build I'll need somewhere between 3/8" to 1/2" of risers. Is that too high? It feels super high!

Should I just go back to my original idea or switch back to 83mm? What are your thoughts???

not too high, I recommend keeping it below 1”. pretty sure the reason my board snapped was because of to 1” risers...

if it feels to high and you dont get use to it, it´s too high!

Try the @whitepony way of keeping bigger wheels without much risers:

I've done that before but the deck is sooo pretty... 

I've never had graphics in my wheel wells which is why I've never had any issues going dremel happy. 
In this case, I think I'll try risers out before I get all giddy with my dremel

More than "None" is too much.

What do you suggest? Different deck or smaller wheels? Why?

I have 24.5mm of riser on a board with 107mm wheels on it, and it's not too much for me.  I'd prefer it to smaller wheels myself

The deck is awesome! I would recommend smaller wheels. It's hard to to work with that deck style though...

I usually use 1/8" but on some decks I've needed 1/4" and that felt like it was pushing it a little, it's probably more of a preference thing but lower is definitely better.

Definitely! There isn't much of a flat on the deck so I'll have to make a clay mold

I usually use 1/2 inch risers with thane, I HATE wheel bite and I tend to carve pretty hard.  With numies I have found that it doesnt really matter, as long as you have some riser to soak up the vibrations, I've got a set of 8mm rubber risers I'm going to start using soon.

get really long trucks if possible and then use little to no rises... else it feels you are like on stilts. I have 1/2" spacer on a deck like you have... just a screwing around Black Friday deal.  Have 97mm blanks on there. It feels a little too high up. I got lipos because I wanted to skip doing an 18650 pack.

Maybe I will get used to it. Gonna post my build today if possible and evening sobriety working in my favor.

Played around with lots of combinations with the Banshee (CF cruiser). The ride height of Paris trucks roughly matches caliber II trucks with 1/4" risers. The Banshee currently uses 83mm wheels, Paris clones, and 1/2" of spacers. Interestingly enough I've swapped 97mm wheels, and didn't experience any wheelbite (super soft bushings). However when I used Caliber II trucks with 1/2" risers and 97mm wheels, I would get a lot of wheelbite.

Any recommendations other than TB clones?

I almost bought that deck! It cracks me up that they have a muirskate box in the background of the graphics! I just couldn't get past the 19" wheelbase. I am running the mini-sugar at 26" and feel like I might need more space lol. 

I may go down to 97 or 90mm wheels if I can find a good deal.

Oh yeah didn't realise it has a riser on it. It's 250mm though so it would probably stick outside the board so there wouldn't be any wheel bite. Maybe grind the rider off?

What about changing the baseplate angle???
I'm riding 44deg baseplates, could I just go up to 50deg? Less lean for the same anount of turn!

I found that angled risers help, I have plus 5 deg front and rear which means I don't need as thick risers. I have the TB 218's though so its 55 deg total. Use the longest wheel base holes, which should help move the wheels away from the deck some.
