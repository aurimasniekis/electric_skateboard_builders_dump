Hi all, 

Just thought I‚Äôd share my recent experience. I am VERY new to the eSkate world, and I have just recently acquired an Exway X1 board. I had thoughts about building one, but parts in South Africa are not freely available and buying abroad and importing is an option, but getting a prebuilt board seemed like the right decision based on circumstances.

I‚Äôve only done a total of 42kms with it, it‚Äôs not for commuting to work or anything simply because drivers have no discipline or consideration for pedestrians or cyclists etc. The main purpose is to learn and enjoy it as a past time. 

I just wanted to say, that I‚Äôm COMPLETLY HOOKED! I love how smooth and responsive the board is. It‚Äôs more quick than I would ever need it to be, and it‚Äôs simply just fun

I can‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs taken so long to get into this hobby 

I haven‚Äôt read extensively on this site, but the community has been very helpful with the few and silly questions I‚Äôve had. 

Looking forward to much more mileage and learning a whole lot more from this site. 

Cheers

I think that as someone new here and to the hobby, the electronics and battery are arguably the most important. Here in the esk8 community were sort of having a growing pain where chinese retailers(not your exway, dont worry) will grab the market, and turn a profit for cheaply made products that cant really be considered to be 'Known as safe'. Just be safe, do research on the part and the reseller before you buy :slight_smile:


Aside from that puddle of words, congratulations!!! Enjoy surfing the sidewalks :sunglasses:

I'm personally too heavy to enjoy the limited range on lightweight prebuilts but I've heard great things about the Exway.

Welcome to the addiction. I agree that DIY might be much harder for you due to location

Exway is the best electric skateboard you can buy right now, that is already pre-assembled, in my own opinion

Pre-assembled meaning In China, nothing like @longhairedboy or @psychotiller boards

My first board was an Exway - it's what got me hooked! Range was the only issue.

Totally forgot about metroboard, it‚Äôs better but much more heavy
