Hey there. I am trying to gauge interest in a US battery groupbuy from LiionWholesale.com I'd be happy to organize but I can't make the post since I'm not a "regular" if there in interest maybe someone else could make the post?

I was thinking of getting some cells but ughh so much work..
I think on the last battery buy they hooked it up and gave the group rates but still shipped directly! if we can get that deal I'd be interested and would help.

would help to actually have the poll tho ;)

[poll type=multiple min=1 max=1 public=true]
* 20 - 30 cells
