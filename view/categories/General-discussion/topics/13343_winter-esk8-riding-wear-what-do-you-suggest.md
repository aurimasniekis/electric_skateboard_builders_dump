Full face helmet, preferably with visor. My head gets cold with my demon podium helmet. Might have to get the tsg pass.
Good gloves. Layered jacket.

Maybe snowboarding gear would work well.

Someone should maybe make an e-snowboard for going uphill. :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

@Michaelinvegas in the NorthEast winter is the time to build battery packs, tinker with VESC settings, and order new parts for the Spring!

I like to use a fingerless motorcycle glove for the trigger hand and a longboard sliding glove on the other hand.

Wouldn't declare yourself the winner yet. I just wear ski goggles a hat, helmet, Nike running gloves, and warm none wind permunable clothes. Welcome to Minnesota <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/1/0/10a35e234445e5aec7059fe358c9ac8c9d68be7b.png" width="281" height="499">

My suggestion is buy a makita heated jacket, thicker jeans wear long unerwear, for gloves you can get any brand of heated motorcycle gloves. The gloves will allow for sensitive throttle manipulation while being streamline. the makita jacket will be durable since its made for carpenters in mind. If you get thick jeans like carhartt or dickies you can guarantee that you will have a durable jean if you may fall.

Oh yeah. Heated jackets Or heated vests instead of layering up. But layering up would be better when you crash.

I used these gloves I got from Bunnings (Australia)
http://www.protectorsafety.com.au/shop/proflex-gloves/gloves-proflex-carpenter-medium-large/
They have reasonable padding for low speed stacks and the thumb/index/middle fingers are exposed at about halfway. Keeps my hands warm whilst still getting accurate feel for the throttle/back

I use fingerless triple 8 Hired Hands gloves with knitted gloves underneath. The combo is warm enough and still allows for a pretty good feel for the remote. Otherwise I ride with my snowboard gear, minus the boots of course!

I would run a fullface anti fog helmet, or a double visor helmet,or maybe even the preditor v6 helmet, light weight water and wind resistance clothing and some sort of full figure combat hard knuckle Kevlar palm gloves with hand warmer thrown in ,another option is the coats by dewalt and such that are heated or even the heated I think raven coat . depends on how long u will be out in the cold ,how much weight ur board can handle..well the motors, not many ride in winter but I deff want to and that is what this next build is all about, maybe run a tracked system on my board ,water proof electronics maybe liquid cooled batteries and motor...yes running 50/50 anti freeze not water be a cool project down fall is I don't think id want liquid cooled in the summer ...any thoughts?

If you guys  think ski goggles are overkill for your climate that you ride in, wear basic clear eye protection glasses to shield your eyes from the oncoming cold air. This works great for me.
