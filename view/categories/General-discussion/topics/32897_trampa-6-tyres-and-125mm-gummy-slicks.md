Have just been having a look on the trampa site and spotted this

They refer to a 6" tyre and mystical 'gummy slicks' 🤗

Someone may have a simple answer and make me look stupid. Hmm 🤔

More mention of 125mm gummy bears🤣 The trampa website is awsome. It's a mixture of old and now irrelevant info, current useful product information and . . . erm . . . Gummy slick stickies 🤤

There products are top notch though 😍

We have a 6 inch low profile high PSI tire in the make. Still in production though. This is a very tricky product and caused our manufacturers some real pain. Finally we managed to make it happen.
Gummies 125mm Urethane slicks are currently being produced. 
Both fit on the Hypa and Superstar.

Hey @trampa when these are out, will they be available in your test ride ? Won't take me long to nip over from Derby 😉

Can't make it unfortunately 😔 Great work on the new products. 100% after the 6" tyres 👍🏻 And I'm really intrigued with the slicks.
