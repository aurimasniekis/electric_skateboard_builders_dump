Hi guys/gals

Fairly new here, but definitely have been reading before I was even a member. I read another post about someone else's board being slow but it seemed they got it figured out with gear ratios. I have a pennyboard that I put bigger trucks, 270kv motor, 70mm wheels, and had a 16:48 gear ratio on a 6S battery with the same ESC as the Meepo board. Was getting about 7-8mph full charge...

Recently upgraded to 90mm wheels, 15:36 gear ratio on a HTD 5m belt, and it is way more sturdy than what I had. I am STILL getting only 8-9mph full charge and I did gain more torque going uphill but where is the speed! I used a calculator at a low 60% efficiency and it says I should be getting 15.8 MPH....What am I doing wrong?

post a picture of your setup, it'll help us pinpoint the problem.

Isn't the meepo 10s? I would say low voltage is your issue

he should still be doing better than 9mph with 6s and that motor/gear ratio.

On those ESC, I dunno, they have a fixed voltage setting and cutoffs
It might be that it's a 7S version...6S would work but in low power

kind of in shambles at this point, I took everything off but these were some pictures without the ESC in, I can put it back together and take some more tomorrow. But that ESC lets you choose 6S 7S or 10S

yep, I had an earlier problem where I didn't realize it was on 7s, and it keeps beeping until you have the right setting on for the battery

When I charg on the imax b6, I stop them at 12.6V but I have not checked current on them yet. I used a voltmeter before when they weren't on full charge but still had a little over 11V on each

And I connect them in Series not parallel so definitely have 6S

Haha, good to know. Had a fellow on here a while back that had his pack all kinds of miswired. Do you notice any improvement when the batteries are fully charged, rather than nearly dead? (11v is getting near the bottom.)

Silly question, does your remote have a speed mode switch?

I haven't ridden too much since the 90mm upgrade but it seems full charge did nothing since I only gained a MPH on full charge and bigger wheels from the 70mm. The remote does have a fast and slow mode and i was on the fast mode when i tested

Are you sure youâ€™re not hitting the erpm limit on your Esc? 270kv and 6s might get you there.

I think the meepo board uses hub motors so the esc is designed for hub motors with a max rpm limit.   I have one of there ESC.  My set up is 10s 7000mah, 40/20 gears and 90mm wheels and dual 200kv motors.  I get like 19 to 22mph.   And I use the same brand of batteries as you

I'm pretty sure @Wilsonliang777 has the right idea. If it is the esc from banggood I'm pretty sure that is the hub motor version

@pennyboard I am not sure how to tell if I am or not from the ESC. The motor definitely spins up good and then maxes out really fast but I don't get why it is different from other set ups. Is it a possibility that the ESC is mostly just ideal to be set up on 10s basically? I will put it back together and take a lot more pictures today (soon).

Did u buy from person or ebay? Maybe @dickyho has experienced this..

Sort of sounds likeu got hub motor version, which has way less rpm per motor when spinning the wheels.. ive heard the ebay esc is also limited to 40kph or so, so in your case u get 3x lower limit

I was unaware of a difference between hub motor version, and I can't find a lot of info on these things.
This is from the right seller - but the listing has changed, and it is not the same version. But that is what I am currently on.

And I have also used the banggood version with the same results.

Battery 1: 12.41 volts
Battery 2: 12.38volts
after series connector: 24.8 volts

So it is definitely getting good power

Banggood sells the hub motor ESC, That is 99% for sure.  And the eBay listing you posted also said hub motor.    So the solution to your problem is to buy hub motors or increase voltage to 10s or keep increase gear ratio or buy new not hub motor ESC.  

  When I use the esk8 calculator to figure my speed I set the my motor kv to 120kv instead of my real motor kv of 200kv.  And the result is pretty correct.

This? The product spec says nothing about it being for hub
https://www.banggood.com/Electric-Skateboard-Longboard-Controller-With-Remote-Dual-Motors-ESC-Substitute-p-1202299.html

Edit:ok I spent more time looking through the product description and although it doesn't say it there the reviews/Q&As seem to indicate this is for hub motors...blueergh

Banggood is not that good with details.  They don't change listing or correct them.  And CS agents don't know the items that they are selling because  they sell so many things.  They do have a good refund and keep the item police.

So it didn't let me post I had to wait for 14 hours etc... but what it sounds like is that if its an ESC for hub motors, then use hub motors. :/ just ordered a set and I really hope it will fix this issue. Will update when I get them.

wow it looks like **you cut off alot from the truck** to get the mount on.
I wouldn't go above 10mph on that! full size unmodified trucks have already snapped!

My guess would be the problem is this esc is for hubs. That means that the ESC is expecting a 1/1 gearing ratio and you do not have that.
