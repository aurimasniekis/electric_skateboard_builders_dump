Can a native Spanish speaker please tell me how to say "rosin core solder" and "solder flux"

I tried using google translate but no cigar :( 

If you can find me a shop in Barcelona where i can just go and buy it, you are officially a  rockstar :slight_smile:

Thanks

I'm not from spain so I don't really know where to buy it there. But you should ask for "esta√±o con resina" or just "esta√±o". And I don't know if there's a Spanish word for flux I've always asked for "flux" but it's not pronounced the same it's like "flute" but with x at the end

Search for esta√±o para soldaduras electricas, nowadays every solder comes with flux

Even though im a native speaker I learned all this stuff in german....

especially if you solder nickle it¬¥s very helpfull.

There's no such thing as too much flux

Google translate is doing literal translations I think so it makes no sense. LOL

I use both. 
For wires usually the solder with flux core is enough.
If I solder on nickle or something which doesn¬¥t want to heat up well I use flux too on top.
