I have a Evolve Carbon GT board in Germany.
As I live in China, there's a bit of a problem bringing it back by airplane.

3 options: 
selling the board on Egay (losing money?)
shipping the battery to Cn (cost??)
selling the battery here 

I need some advice.
did anybody ship a battery from Europe already?



edit: 
the board was used for 2-3 weeks only.

```
sell the battery in germany and build a custom in china
You will be able to get more range then.
You may have to seperate the evolve BMS as it's part of the esc I believe

that's a good option. from Evolve you can buy a spare battery for 450â‚¬
let's see how much somebody wants to pay here.
In China I have 80 Sanyo batteries w/ 3500mAh
could use them. but then I would use my own BMS.

but honestly, I am more happy with a Trampa and the gear from Nowind (Jenso) I even think of selling the whole board.

@ElskerShadow
funny, I did that. brought a Landwheel for a friend.
it broke after 5 min
now I have my second board from them, also broken and wasted 400$
not to mention the multiple times mounting the (useless) drive on the board, trying it, asking for refund, and heard even generation 3 from Landwheel/useless/boards still have problems.

I have a question. In January I'm moving to Shenzhen and I also have Bamboo GT which i love pretty much. Did you figure out how to ship the board to China?

you can not ship it in the normal way. I think just by "ship" which takes 30 days and a lot of paperwork involved.
