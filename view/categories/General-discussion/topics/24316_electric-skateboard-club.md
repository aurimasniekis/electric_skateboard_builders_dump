This *is* the club. Our brother and sister esk8ers. Or as @longhairedboy would call it, we are a band of skatan's little rocket-powered minions

There's a Meetup group here in Seattle.  Might be one (or you could create one) for your area...

We are all brothers and sister in Skatan. 

Hail Skatan. 

Hail Esk8. 

Hail heavily caffeinated corn syrup based carbonated beverage of your choosing.

There's a meetup group in SoCal on Meetup.com (there's an app) call "OC-Boosted-Boarders" however they are a BOOSTED group...They seem to rarely meetup. They rode together two months back but I wasn't able to join. Their ride was along the Huntington Beach area and always about 5 miles due to their battery restrictions. They charge up for lunch and do a return trip.

See you *this* Sunday maybe?

i could tow all of them at once on the way back and still have enough juice to do the whole course again.

@sl33py

I'm hoping.  There's a problem with my remote right now that I need to figure out.  If I can nail it I should be there.

Thanks, but they are custom XBee remotes.  I worked on them a bit the other night and definitely made some improvement, but I'll have to go for a ride tonight or tomorrow to test.  Last time the remote just died about a mile out.  I suspected there was a problem so I had brought a friend on a bike who towed me back.

If I do come to the meetup I'll bring a tow strap (dog lead) and hope someone is willing to tow me :slight_smile:

I wouldn't be surprised if it’s down for good. Didn’t seem very popular anyways
