Hey guys, this is Paxson from Electric Skateboard HQ.

I was presented with a problem that I think is worth solving. A reader messaged me saying the Buffalo board that she bought has broken down and as Buffalo, the company has gone out of business, she has no one helping the repair.
 
I am anticipating a lot more people are going to face a similar problem, and it will help everyone out if we can connect those who have broken boards to those who are keen to offer third-party product repair service.

Establishing a 'network of 3rd party repair service' might even help the sport to grow.

So, if anyone is interested in doing third party repair, please reply with your name, location and the way you would like to be contacted with (email/ phone/ facebook). I will add everyone to a list and share the list to all visible place on the internet. 

Hope everyone can help to spread the word. Cheers!

I'm a student in mechanical engineering at Purdue, still have lots to learn but I could definitely do simple repairs such as soldering, basic machining, replacing parts etc.

Thanks for the catch! hahaha.

Played too much Age of Empire in the past, and I guess I overusing cheat code "Big Daddy" has a lasting impact. =P
