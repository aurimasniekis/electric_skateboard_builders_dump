Hey Guys.

I was following this forum for some months already and now almost finished my Electric Longboard.

I have a Landyachtz Drop Carve 37 with Bear Trucks that I used to convert into my electric longboard.
The Motor is a 6374 with Hall Sensor from Maytech (170KV)
The Battery is an Samsung INR18650-25R 12S2P.

I run the custom firmware from the Forum on the Maytech VESC.
At first I was schocked how the motor accelerates - I had to make the throttle curve a lot lighter.

There are only some things I wonder maybe some of you guys could help me out ?

*** Since I only have 12S2P I set the Batt regen to -7A because I am afraid of overcharging when breaking - do you think this is a safe value? (and/or is there any other way to get better breaking without upgrading my battery pack?) **

*** My Turn radius is really bad and I am not sure if it's the trucks or me just being a noob ? I think the trucks are not too tight because on acceleration I clearly get some insane wobbling - any ideas ? **

*** The board has a lot of torque (Motor pulley 16T and Wheel pulley 36T on 76mm wheels) so I am more than happy with uphill performance, I just seem to have traction problems - any recommendations ? **

Thanks to all of you for this great forum ! I am so glad to have you all :slight_smile:

Hey

Nice build you got there!
About your turn radius: If you never skated before, then its completely normal. After time you'll get comfortable on your board and you'll also get tighter turns.

I also had traction problems at first, are you riding goofy(right foot in front) or regular(left foot in front)?
Your weight is more in the heel side, it could be that the motor is placed on the wrong side.

Hey there :slight_smile:
@FabianOdermatt Thanks - the carbon enclosures didn't turn out very good - i had no vacuum bag or anything like this and pretty much just went for it :confused: 

I did skate when i was very very young so probably last time was around 20 years ago :smiley:

I ride regular. I always try to shift weight to the front foot so that motor can get a grip - but I was thinking about trying to ride Rear Wheel Drive for a test.. Should be better for Uphill I could imagine.  

I am waiting for my 12S BMS so at the moment I just charged it once without a BMS to 48V .. hope it will not ruin my pack..

A lot of your turning radius issue is the trucks and wheel choice.  I applaud you 'making it work' though.  I would suggest larger wheels and wider trucks, those are 176mm?  Larger wheels and wider trucks will give you a more stable platform at speed and a more lean without wheel bite..  Try some harder bushings board side as well.

Yeah was not easy to get this low riding board working everything was a struggle.. from mounting the motor to fitting a idler pulley on that small motor mount and other issues on mounting the battery pack, vesc etc. to keep the same flex of the board.
I kinda wanted to roll with the lowriding profile and if there is another way I would like to keep that.
I ordered Bones Double Action Bushings (91A) though for testing.. let's see if that makes any difference at all.

Today I got my BMS.. its an 80A BMS so I think I will also let it handle the discharge not only the charging.
For now I have a 12S2P pack but I will upgrade to 12S3P for better Regen Breaking.

I also invested in some Bone Double Action Bushings with flat washers - didn't test them out yet because I dont have a case at the moment (but Psychotiller enclosure should arrive soon)..

Upgraded to 12S3P 8000mah today. And the BMS seems to do a very nice job.
Can't wait to try my new pack once the weather get's better

Since my Psychotiller case will take some time for shipping I just prepped up a quick DIY Tape mount for a test ride of the new battery..
The acceleration and torque is insane.. when going uphill i need only 20 % throttle to go up really fast.. even very steep hills will feel like i am going on a flat surface.
Also the app calculated around 50 km Range with my style of driving which is crazy good (while not 100% realistic but when i can get 20-30 km i will be happy)

Ok so almost finished my build now.
Thanks to the psychotiller enclosure it looks clean now.
Changed from a 80A to a 60A BMS which fits nicely into my enclose with the 12S3P Li-Ion 18650 Pack.
Also have Bluetooth modules for both BMS and the VESC. No need to open the case anymore.. Luxury..

My kind of deck. Only beef I have with it is that it is too short. I ride a similar blank deck double kick dropthrough 42 inch and I even find that one too short. 

Hoping to get one custom made one day when cash flow is on the uppity and make it at least 46 inch.

For me it's perfect.. a good compromise at least.
It is very flexible and bouncy (I designed the battery pack and mounted the enclosure that way.. the battery pack is split into 4 segments so the board can bounce and flex almost like the stock landyachtz deck).

Mostly the boards that can be bought on complete ESK8's are not my kind of thing.. So have to go DIY

As long as you get good prints a 3d printed pulley is fine. I've got a 36t set with over 1000 miles in them, wash them off and they still look new. I've for a 72t set that looks just as good I'm gonna run MBS tjrucks and wheels.

What kinda clearance does your motor have over the ground? Just in the process of doing my build and there's very little info on recommended clearances.

Any issues running it that low?

I didn't measure the clearance.. but you can see it in the photos. Now with the MBS Wheels I have more clearance and no problems anymore (of course I didn't just go up and down of sidewalks and mainly go on flat surfaces otherwise my Motor would take a hit here and there).

The carbon pulley failed :( The Belt does not fit - the dimension is a little off and the pitch does not seem to be correct.. Sad because the filament was quite expensive and I had high hopes.. so maybe I will use it for something that fullfills no function.

However at least after testing the whole day - both LED lights seem to be working nicely. Can't wait to test them at night.

So anyone here had experience with that PETG-CARBON ?
I will test to make a motor mount now.. hope it is good for something.

Beautiful board, wish I could go low like this, but the roads here doesn’t allow 

On the pulley, what I do with mine is to print a small slice, 5mm in fine and just the teeth, basically a ring with teeth, and tweak the dimensions until it fit perfectly with the belt, then you print the full pulley

So after a lot of tweaking I am now able to print ABS without warping and with true dimensional accuracy.

![grafik|281x500](upload://mWZoI49dmGlhCVMf1bCNK5MVE1W.jpg)

It was not so easy.. I kindof messed up 3 pulleys before.

The Calibration cube shows it best.. Right side cube is the first try.. left side cube was after the calibration today.

No I didn't follow any guide but I basically checked every screw - every axis measurement - every limit switch - took apart the extruder and hotend and everything and made sure that I reassembled it perfectly.
After that I just took my chance and tried some settings until the cube measured exactly 20mm  (extruder flow rate) and then I adjusted the temperature so that I get no warping.

The trick is to use a "UHU STICK" glue on the bed and make a nice big brim around the part.
Bed Temperature is 100°C and Hotend Temp is 240 °C. The Fan is off until I start Layer 10 - then I turn it on to around 20 %.

I´ve been using PLA for my wheel pulleys and none failed so far. I used PLA for my prototype motor mount years ago and it worked reasonably well - but failed eventually. Print temperatures around 250° for Carbon PETG (depending on manufacturer) seems to offer enough headroom to withstand temperatures that might occur on the mount. So yeah, I think it could work. I have a spool of carbon filament here myself just waiting to be tested but I need to upgrade my printers hotend first - and I aint got time for that yo! :grin: summer is around the corner and my second build is almost done. A man has got to set his priorities :grin: 

Just make sure your mount is rigid enough to withstand the mechanical stress. I had a PLA motor mount fail on me while I was riding - luckily I was slow enough that nothing happened. The motor literally fell off with a chunk of the PLA motor mount. Don´t want that to happen at higher speeds... 

As for wheel pulleys - Carbon fiber is abrasive enough to cause some serious wear on a brass nozzle so I personally would´nt use it on pulleys since it may cause your belt to fail too soon due to its abrasive properties. I´m still using PLA for my pulleys but PETG or Nylon might even be better. I´m just too lazy and don´t have enough time on my hands to try out those materials at the moment. PETG constantly fails printing because of heat creep causing the PETG filament to soften up beyond the heatbreak thus causes clogs on my printer and eventually fail. I have an E3D hotend waiting to be installed buuuuut - priorities :grin:

Hey man, yeah just finishing my first build waiting for parts, mines a low rider drop through but i cheated and used a prebuilt carbon deck with an integral enclosure, full marks for the enclosure effort! I was just going to say that as a heavier guy i always chuck my prebuilt in reverse and go up front wheel drive, it seems to pull better than push.
How much fun is this stuff?
I'm too posh to push lol

I actually never tried a rear wheel drive.. but maybe will try someday.. Also The Motor will get less dirty when its in the front and better air circulation.

Well the 6384S is a beast. I can go up any hill - only limitation on extreme hills is that my VESC will get hot because of the closed enclosure (but I rather have it closed to protect it from water and dust).
I have heatsinks on my VESC but still when the motor is pulling 50A+ it will get hot quite fast (but those are really mountain village hills then).

So great fun

That is a big lump to be sure wow.  Mines running the standard 6374 dual and i'm hoping it gets me up my hills as nothing prebuilt likes to.  Maybe i just need to lose some weight. I shouldnt run into too many heat issues with dual motors and a 10s battery but i fully intend to chuck a 12s in there at some point so i will be hitting up all these lovely experts for some settings advice soon.  anyway man good luck with the developing build and look out for my thread soon!

Good luck for your built.
Dual 6374 should make it easy - however I was always aiming at 12S just for the sake of lower KV Motor - high torque - less amp for the same power.
Don't forget your protection gear.. got thrown off 2 times... First time was a full brake at around 35km/h - still don't know what happened there.. took some time to recover and second time was speed wobble because my VESC went into Motor Overheat Mode while accelerating - so the change from acceleration to idle made me have to jump off the board. However it was "only" at 25 km/h so I was able to run it out.
I ordered a padded hoodie now and always wear a helmet and gloves now.

Looking good. Just saw  the pics of your motor fan. I noticed that your 3d print have a few issues. You may need to address a few things before you use functional 3d printed parts.

This is what I think is going on:

 **you're printer is over extruding.** calibrate the e-steps of your extruder stepper motor. This will improve accuracy of your parts. If you're still having problems try decreasing or increasing the extrusion width of the outer walls.

**your print temperature seems too high**. When your printing at a too low temperature your print layers will delaminate easily. Too high temperatures leads to poor print quality. Try to print a "temperature tower" to determine your materials ideal/optimal print temperature. This will also help improve the precision of you 3d parts. 

A final thought - I'd print that motor fan with Carbon PETG. Those fins might fail at higher RPMs...just to be sure your safety is not compromised.

hey..
Thanks for the input
However when I aim at stability I always like to overextrude with higher temp (better binding and more material).

I tested the fan at highest rpm and highest temps and it is holding up pretty good.
Its a special kind of PLA and however I don't like Carbon PETG anymore as it fucks up my nozzles.

You need a wear resistant nozzle with a bigger diameter. Perhaps a 0.5mm or a 0.6mm nozzle. I use a 0.6mm from Micro Swiss. Worth investing in if you plan to print a lot.
