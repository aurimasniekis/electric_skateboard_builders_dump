Cincinnati in the house! Someone on reddit started a cinci group but it's not DIY. It looks like some boosteds and a riptide. How old are you and where are you out of?

Oh wait... oops

Some people like drinking beers with new friends and some prefer serving alcohol to minors. I'm the former.

Still cool you're riding, much less inclined to let you try my board though unfortunately. Can't let a minor get hurt going 30+ on my build.

Sure did.  One of them.  Got focboxes in one and I've just put the hobbywing upgraded one in the beer meepo.  @thebeardedboy the hobbywing/dual esc in these things is completely factory set.  You can not change a thing on it.  Vesc derivative however you have full configuration control via vesc tool.

@venom121212 i was thinking about belt drive  but i decided on hub motors because of less maintenance  im probably gonna try that park out this summer  when my first board is done i was thinking about buying two but one nice one would be alot better
