Would like to see chat room working properly again.  I learned so much about this hobby from awesome people in the chat w/10+ days read time that can easily point a person to a helpful thread instead of making new one that has already been done just worded differently.  This could save a person a lot of time (individual and moderators) and this site a lot of space/organization.

i was a big fan of the chat. it was super useful to ask quick questions rather than start a whole thread. also generally chat with others about what your working on.
