got a couple motor pulleys from ollin, great quality.
but the keyway on my motors is just too narrow. 2.85mm where the keys are 2.99mm.

I can flat spot the shafts but I would really rather use the keys. anyone have a good idea to widen the keyway? 

or does anyone have a couple keys around 2.8mm wide? thanks!

file the keys down? I'd rather do that than try to open the keyway wider...

i was thinking that too. but its not easy to file down these tiny pieces of steel.

but i will probably find a clamp and take the dremel to em if no one has some skinny keys...

You can do either or. Sanding down the key would be less expensive. Any machinist can widen the key way pretty easy. Just put some 150-220 grit on something nice and flat and just go to town with the key lol.

I've never had a key that fit perfectly into my keyways, always had to file them down. What I did was used double sided tape and stick it down to a table, then take a dremel with filing bit to it and grind it down on both sides. Works like a charm.

I haven't tried it before, but I would use a longboard wheel and griptape.  Put the key on the griptape or sandpaper (withsomething hard underneath like metal or glass), put the longboard wheel on the key, and scratch it back and forth trying to keep it flat.  At least that's what I would try first

edit: use a trashed longboard wheel, not a new one

My key was too high and filing it down to a perfect fit was like 2 minutes. Put the metal file on the table and held the key between two fingers and filed back and forth. Easy as a duck! ðŸ˜„ Nails got a bit filed down as well so saved a few pennies on the manicure.

What you could do is if your pulley has set/grub screws, you can line that up with the keyway and screw it in there, kind of ghetto and might scratch up your keyway though.

You can probably scrape the keyway and remove that .06mm of material with a utility blade.

If you place the key in a vice and hit it with a series of files that would be a lot less risky then modding the keyway in the shaft also a dremel is going to ugly up the shaft no matter how skilled you are with it and then if you want to sell the motor at some stage that will go against its resale price

Bastard/2nd/smooth they are often packaged in threes for this

The cool kids seem to be using glue, Loctite bearing (brainfart, I meant "retaining") compound, 648. No key needed.

I've found it works great. But it takes some courage and tenacity to get them back off.

And yeah my keys didn't fit. the plan was sandpaper on a flat surface, but the glue worked fiercely.

Yep its called retaining compound, i guarantee it will stick. It will also be more balanced. To remove just use a hot air gun. I use the cheap retaining compound from rs components uk.

Glue the key to the vise/table/washing machine/workbench. Then measure it with the depth guage on your caliper so you don't have to pry it off to check it.

CA or maybe hot glue.

Clean files stay clean and cut fast and smooth until  you rub them back and forth like your trying to make fire.

You think that it's working faster, but it it's not. It's just getting clogged, and starting to skip and chatter.

In fairness keyway stock is or should be hardened steel,so it will not fill the air with clouds of metal filings but a quality file should work it down certainly

```
new rule:

When in doubt, Dremel that shit out!
----------

double sided foam tape, straight on the the table. 2 mins per side. click click perfect fit!

using the setscrews in the keyway did chip away a bit, and I think caused more wear on the pulley from wobble....

They're in the shaft...3 months to late for that. Lol. My buddies filed Thiers down..I just threw mine in an arbor press with the key on the press plate, then put the shaft of the motor on top of the key with the keyway facing down. 

You see keyways typically need to be hammered/tapped or pressed in in the automotive world..so I didn't think twice, went right for the press...

Also, you could have gone for a different key size....
a 7/64 key would have fit perfectly
0.003in undersized which isnt perfect but it's probably closer than what you can get with a dremel.
