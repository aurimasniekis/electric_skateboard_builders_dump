Hi guys doing some market research and wondered if you could spend 1 minute of your time?

If you built a new full custom board setup forgetting board colour what colour wheels would you buy as first choice?

Many thanks for your input.

Red wheels are nice because they still look pretty good when they have road dirt worn into them.
