I know we have the parts list for new builders, but with safety on e-boards being a big concern, I think we should also have a list of options for safety gear. Just so that a new builder doesn't come around thinking that plastic kneepads are all they need to be safe while riding.

Helmets

* TSG Pass
* Triple8 Racer
* Predator DH6 

Pads

* 180killerpads

TSG Pass probably the best full face?

Triple8 Racer and Predator DH6 are also good helmets. 180killerpads are the best elbow and knee pads according to most people on silverfish.
