guys hi, what would you do if a vendor advertised a price of $216 on their website but actually charged you $237 

just wondering as this has happened to me recently.

First, gather evidence.  Next, I would contact them and ask them to refund the difference.  The steps after that would depend on the results of the first two steps.

Dbl check if shipping was/wasn't included... or do as @b264 said. 

that would suck to get a surprise of extra $21 charge out of blue.
