I am intended to make some Kegel pulleys,  but I have difficult to find Kegel wheels in china. could some one can send me a Kegel wheel for measuring and testing pulleys. 2pcs will be much better. old or damaged one will be ok.

Yea I often buy from Taobao as that's easier for me in Asia :slight_smile:
Do you mind shooting me a link to your taobao store so I can save it into my fav list?

I almost don't sell things on Taobao, because selling on ebay occupied most of my time.

@von How do the pins fit?  Do you have the old kegel cores or the new flipped kegel cores?

My pulleys haven't arrived yet :cry:

I don’t have any kegel cores right now. I bought them in preparation but I will have access to some kegels this Sunday. Will update! I will also have some elofty wheels which many suspect are just boosted wheels. Tbh I didn’t know there is a new and there was an old core.... 

Just a confirmation that the kegel pulley shouldn’t have any problems with calibers. Flywheel pulley is still the same though.

Here are some pictures. They seem to fit fairly well on the kegels and elofty boosted wheels. Still haven’t had time to ride them yet.

Relevant to you @b264 

Flipped core 110s, the fit is pretty damn good, almost no play. I had resigned myself to possibly heat shrinking the posts but I wont need to.
