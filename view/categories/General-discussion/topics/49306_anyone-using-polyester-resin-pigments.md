I just got a new vacuum pump and I want to do something with it...
My current enclosure is not the best so  Id like to make a new one

Paint is scratchable but if you paint the resin with the pigment it shouldnt look lile shit when you scratch it right?

Put the pigments into the resin and the gelcoat. 
Mix up to 8% pigment. But less will ok.

Something with [fluorescent](https://www.smooth-on.com/product-line/glow-worm) pigment could also look quite fancy.

Iâ€™m sure youâ€™ve already found it. But...
If you have a little search about on the site thereâ€™s a few other colour charts to choose from. 
Jet black from this one perhaps.

This is uk based. Iâ€™m sure you could find the same thing in ðŸ‡­ðŸ‡·?

Does it need to be a paste-like colour? I see a lot of these colour powders on ebay and was wondering if functions the same?

The paste mixes in really well and gives a solid colour. I've only ever used cement pigment powder in resins when trying to add some colour when I've done some colouring of sculptures. It didn't mix in so well a patchy and not solid colour.
Boat builders use the paste for the opacity it gives.
@Acido if it's cheap enough and you give the powder a go, let us know how you get on and show us some photos.

So it may take some time

Thanks for the answer. I think i'll go with the paste since i want it to be evenly spread colour and not anything less.

Graphite powder works good for black . You can also ask for sample  cups of tint at the paint store.

graphite is conductive, so i guess its not the best idea to use it for enclosures

Just throw a whole pencil in your new ninja blender on high. Use this in your final coat to save on pencil cost

You can put anything in your last coat then finish coat with a uv stable layer of epoxy like the kind I use for making fishing rods and it looks beautiful and flexible without cracking.

I want to use pigments colors whatever so i get rid of scratches
if i scratch a paint it will look like shit, but if i fully color the resin there wont be those problems, maybe something like last 3 coats with coal

I Understand the scratch issue. Try using the coal and a matte black gel coat to hide scratches instead of the gloss black.  Gel coat needs to be about the thickness of a dime to start being strong.

Should work.... maybe you could dye fiberglass fibers black cause I know you can buy it and people use it under thin carbon fiber composites  to help hide on the corners

Coal makes the resin very black!
My mistake is that i was tight with time and didnt keep it long enaugh in the blender
For the best results I would blend it for a minute or so, but then you will end up still with some pretty big chunks, dump some water in to all of that and blend it for a few seconds so it mixes well, then get a towel or something similar and put the water thru it then take that black water and make it boil and you will end up with the finest powder you can make at home :smiley:

It takes like 15min to do all of that and you can buy 100g of pigment for like 5 pounds but I like to do things on my own even tho it takes 5x time, its fun for me.

The black bubbles are the chunks of coal, I just threw a big shot glass of polyester on this, will post the cured look tonight probably!

I see what you're saying but the resin still stays reasonably clear with chunks in it..
Be careful with the water. Any remaining moisture will play havoc with the curing.

This pic is taken a minute ago, its around 70% cured but its still black as f, glossy too :D
Tomorrow I will hold it up in the air and take a pic, and try to find a way to get coal powder without having to clean my blender for half an hour

You can get a result like this, perhaps better by using cement pigment. It comes in powder that is finer than coal.

Maybe you could use a belt sander or a grinder first. Then take that and use a mortar and pestle.
