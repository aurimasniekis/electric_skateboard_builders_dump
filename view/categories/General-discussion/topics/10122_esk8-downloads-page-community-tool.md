Because this forum does not support downloads, and you can never be sure that a dropbox link is the one you want, I created a downloads page with things like the BLDC tool, FVT firmware updating software, and the correct firmware for the 6s esc. If you have a file you want to share simply PM me and I will give you my email address, and then post the files. I look forward to seeing this resource grow!

Here is the [link](https://electric-skateboard.market/downloads/)!

That is very odd. I have tried downloading with bot windows 10 and 7 and it worked fine. @XIII
