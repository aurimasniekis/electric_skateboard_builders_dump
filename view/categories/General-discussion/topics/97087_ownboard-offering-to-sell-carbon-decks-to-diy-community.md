I am posting on behalf of Ownboard.  I DM'ed them on Instagram after seeing their beautiful carbon deck and asked if they would sell to the DIY community.  I have no idea of the price.  DM them on Instagram @ownboard_skateboard for more info!  Hopefully they will actually make an account here if enough of you are interested.
