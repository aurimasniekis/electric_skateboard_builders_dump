How does everyone here mount their enclosures? Do you use screws? I have a concave in my deck so how could I mount an enclosure? Sorry for so many questions!

T-nuts. That way you'll have threaded stainless holes to screw your enclosure into.

Would this work with a concave deck though as the enclosure is flat and my deck is curved

This is probably one of the most difficult challenges to making a professional looking electric skateboard.

some decks just are not flat enough to nicely mount onto. I think using a `shell` (not a box) like a vacuum formed abs shell to cover your parts is a good option....

I have used everything from nuts & bolts, nut inserts, really strong double sided tape, glue &, self tapping wood screws....

in the end i decided ill just make a carbon fiber deck with everything built-in.

So how could I do it? Sorry if I am being an annoyance! I don't want to do a vacuum forming setup. I may be able to dremel a flat spot.

There isnt a huge concave... ``
I may be able to use psychotiller's method but the screws will be sticking out a bit. <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/1X/e012fc0f6f6bec1d5ea35f9705f06be7ed572647.jpg" width="669" height="499">

do a mock up with battery & esc, then you can play around with different layouts to find the best form factor.

Do you already have the case?

One thing you can do is use some foam material and build a flat spot....

Yes. If you use abs it is flexible enough to take the shape of the concave.

a plastic box with flanges (i suppose you could call this a lid also) will follow the concave curve close enough, some better than others. If you make and use a rubber gasket you might get a snugger fit and that will also seal out the moisture and dirt. I plan on making a gasket for my build this weekend. Last weekend i did a test drive in the rain and water got into my box. I also got water inside the switch, forcing my power to stay on until the heat gun (on a very, very low setting) eventually dried out the switch and it returned to functioning normally. 

I used stainless steel button head wood screws for fasten my box/lid on. While i did notice that there were some waves between the screws, i think using a rubber gasket and doubling the number of screws would solve that issue. 

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/1X/6bf926fedb9cbfedbe6ca0cc084f3ecc35de1496.jpeg" width="666" height="500"> 

I would also like to start using t-nuts and machine screws (M4s maybe?) whenever possible with these lids. It would provide a much cleaner finish and allow you to remove the screws frequently without wearing out the wood. Definitely an item for future builds/upgrades. Don't forget the threadlocker when using machine screws though. For the button heads here i used a tiny drop of wood glue to act as threadlocker. When i later had to remove the screws again, it was just enough to make them difficult but not impossible to remove and also didn't hurt the wood. Your milage may vary, of course.

I used that box for a while. 

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/1X/980cc414740e3b683df4641a1f42c0d50b37f7e2.jpg" width="666" height="500"> 

I strongly suggest using a foam pad under the box, i made one out of black duct tape and foam project board like you get at a craft store. And be careful when tightening the bolts down. You'll want to do 1 or 2 turns then move on to the next bolt, and just go around a few times like that until they're all tightened evenly. If you don't you'll end up warping the flanges which will stress the endplates which will result in the steel screws coming a little loose and sawing their way through the edges of the plates, which leads to dragging a broken box on the ground when the vibration finally gets to it or you hit a speed bump the wrong way. Also, the screws that come with the box are very, very short. If you poke around in the box a lot like I do, that will become a problem after a while of screwing and unscrewing those tiny screws all the time. I ended up replacing those screws with longer ones once a few of them finally stripped and fell out. 

So i made a one-piece plastic box and have since decided to never again use multi-piece extruded metal boxes.

Or I could use the aluminium enclosure, build a flat spot with foam, get some new screws, drill through the deck, put nuts on the screws.This may help it stay on and I can have the batteries mounted under with velcro tape and some velcro straps for eascy access.

I got my enclosures with the flanges from polycase.com (http://www.polycase.com/dc-47F & http://www.polycase.com/dc-46F). I have the batteries and the esc/reciever in separate enclosures. I used regular nuts and bolts to mount them. I found that the batteries were too heavy to the point were they would rip off the cover while riding, so I had to modify the battery enclosure to accommodate velcro straps.

I have made all of my enclosures from carbon fibre.
I started off custom molding separate ESC and battery compartments, but then I just went to one big box to house them all.
It turns out neater looking even if it is more bulky.

@longhairedboy The velcro straps are way too long, so I just stuffed the excess underneath the enclosure. You can't even notice it. With the velcro straps, the cover won't fit with these turnigy 7.2 ah hardcase batteries.

That's going to look pretty good once its all together. You could get some of that black plastic conduit to wrap the wires up between the boxes and you'll have a pretty  durable rig. Do those boxes seal pretty tight? This looks like it would be splash/mud proof which is always a bonus.

These enclosures don't come with gaskets, but I'm sure they're somewhat waterproof. Like I said previously, with the velcro straps and these tall 4s Lipos doesn't allow me to put the cover on, so they'll be exposed, but I don't plan on riding this in the rain. I might just keep it how it is. I can't really spend anymore money in this.

Scissors, sandwhich bags, and some black duct tape will do to keep the crud and water out until you can figure out a solution to the lid problem. 

For clarity, i'm not suggesting that you duct tape the scissors to the board. Only that you use them to cut the bags apart and to shape. 

Although having blades poking out of your board may be useful in situations where you are being pursued by a local war party.

I have been meaning to post this for some time but forgot.
I have used clevis pins to mount my battery enclosure on one of my boards where I wanted quick access to the battery box to change batteries if required.

I used a silicone grommet under the R clip to hold it and absorb vibration.
the clevis pins were just drilled straight through the board with a tight tolerance, and countersunk at the top.

I plan on running a thin neoprene gasket around under the enclosure and also would want to avoid rattles!  I haven't gone so far as to ban metal boxes... but i'm close.  ;)

@lowGuido I like this solution a lot. When I was planning my build I didn't want to have to unscrew 4-6 bolts to gain access to the electronics or batteries, so I chose an enclosure with a door. I'm paying for it with reduced ground clearance. These clips make me reconsider the choice!

Has anyone had any problems with overheating escs on a fully enclosed case?

I'm planning on 3D printing a case and unsure if I'll need to allow for air flow to keep everything cool. If no one has had any issues I'll be going for a water tight seal.

depends on the esc:
the VESC and torqueboard's 12s esc are fine being enclosed- I've used torqueboard's esc completely enclosed (and so has @torqueboards himself on some of his builds) , and you see vesc builds everywhere with zero air flow. 

 **but** esc's with fans usually need to have the fan breathing through a hole.. check out @longhairedboy's build as an example; you can clearly see two wholes cut for his esc fans.

@Mitch Yes you have to ventilate the ones with fans. @cmatson is right about the fanless ones, though. They do fine in a sealed enclosure. 

 I had two fanned 6S escs in an enclosed box and now I only have one. I'm not 100% sure that the lack of cool intake was the culprit in this particular case, but there's a good chance of it so I wouldn't risk it. 

If you're running one with a fan that claims to be dust and water proof/resistant than my suggestion would be to isolate it inside its own compartment within your box. This could be as simple as hot glueing a barrier between the ESCs and the battery/switch compartment. As long as no bare copper is present within the SC compartment, you should be able to ventilate the ESC compartment with some vent holes in the sides and bottom of the box. Just make sure that if any water splashes in there that it can drain out.

Yeah cutting a hole for the ESC to just poke through like that is fine in most cases. It rains almost every day here though, so i'm kind of anal about keeping my box sealed. Even on days its dry, there still seems to be mud and moisture caking up everywhere. There's just always water on the ground in Florida.

I'm not sure. I think if you got them in there tight and used some epoxy to make sure they stayed in and didn't back themselves out (they are just hollow screws with threads on the inside as well as the outside) then they should work out pretty well. 

I saw these but then I thought maybe I needed something with more teeth so I ordered a bag of the regular style t-nuts for my boxes.

These are great. Of course, better below the grip tape but on the top it's not too bad either.

I have used those on one of my decks, but not to hold the enclosure, just to hold the wiiceiver to the board.
worked quite well.

Whats a good length for the thumb screws to go with the 10-32 3/16th Tee nut? That site has 1/2", 5/8" and 3/4" lengths for the hex screws I was looking at. It looks like some of the other hand screws have other lengths as well.

Hmm didn't you post 10-32 3/16th for the Tee nut earlier ?
Doesn't this mean 3/16 inch length of Tee nut ?
What do you mean both should be 1/2" ?

1/2" for thumb or regular screws with T-nuts. If you go longer than 1/2" the screw will poke through the board and not be flush.

I'll get these:

I think these should be compatible right ?

Thanks.

*edit didn't realize the hex thumb screws were so expensive.
I can just use any of the following with the t-nut, right:

I wonder why the http://www.mcmaster.com/#90113a150/=zoqiv8 are so expensive.

*edit actually @psychotiller do you know how many screws you actually need for the enclosure that I got from you. I know it has a total of 20 holes along the edges, is it best to have them all?

As long as you get it secured and to your liking it is fine.  Spacing the screws evenly is the main thing.

## \#125 Posted by: torqueboards Posted at: 2015-11-06T18:06:54.686Z Reads: 464

I would say 1/2" or smaller. If it's longer than 1/2 even 1/2" is pretty long so will take you a while to unscrew. As psychotiller mentioned I'd say 3/16" is a good size for both.

Ok thanks guys I decided on these.

http://www.mcmaster.com/#90975a015/=zooilh
http://www.mcmaster.com/#98164a178/=zoua2h

I believe the hex size on the latter should be the same as the allen size on the Skate Tools so it should still be convenient to screw/unscrew rather than using a thumb screw.

You're just snugging them. Not putting 30 foot pounds of torque on them..i was more concerned with the spikes on the t nuts. Those aren't fiber glass friendly..

There are  several tnuts  available without the prongs. Then you just epoxy them in place instead of pounding the prongs into the fiberglass

It's fine. I personally wouldn't worry about it. If they're not black and it bugs you, you could always paint them black too. Or if you decide to, a grip tape job would cost you 8 bucks.

Just screwing into the board might not be a good idea, you could work with inserts if you don't like to drill through the board though.

Hi!

First of all, sorry if this is the wrong sub-forum, wasnt sure where to put this! :smiley:
As the title states, I'm looking to permanently mount my battery box, but am unsure how to.

These are the options i've considered:
Bore holes all the way through the deck, and doing a nut & bolt setup, as i've done with the trucks.
Just use a screw and let it screw into the board.

Im thinking boring the holes might be better, since screwing a screw into the board would expand the wood, and maybe creating a weak point.

So what should i do?

Regards,
Leonardvdj

I prefer screwing it in. As long as you screw it in and you don't keep unscrewing it's perfectly fine.

A bolt/nut work great it's just hard to remove if you ever wanted too. Inserts would be a great ideas well but aligning everything so they fit properly can be a bit difficult as well.

I tried N-magnets before but they'll come off.

I prefer the following methods:
- Screws w/ Slide Enclosure
- Bolt/Thumb Nut would be the simpler/easiest option.
- Bolt/Lock Nut would be the most reliable.

I use adhesive backed neoprene foam sheets. You can get it in all different thicknesses. I use 1/8" for padding my electronics. I get my stuff off Ebay. 

Once it's on your board, it's very difficult to remove, so I expose only a small area of the adhesive. Just enough so everything stays in place. To seal the enclosure, you can lay strips along the edge, or you can just do one big pad like Evolve or Ego does that pads your electronics and seals the enclosure edges.
