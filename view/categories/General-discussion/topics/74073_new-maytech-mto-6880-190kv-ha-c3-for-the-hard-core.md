I will get all the info I can tonight and if we can put a group buy together I will not mind facilitating it we have more to order.

the rep will have a data sheet for me tonight with the hole pattern as well, but I suspect if your mounts have a recess the can sits in, then you may need a new mount. it's just not enough to move mount holes

@hyperIon1 Ask the if the sensor assembly is brine-proof (not brine-resistant)

Of course we know the bearings won't be, but ask about the low-voltage bits please

Ask if they use conformal coating on the sensor parts *after* they've been assembled and soldered?

@hyperIon1 If they do 8mm shafts, can you see if we can get them without that step down from 10mm-8mm where the shaft exits the can? My issue now is that my TB and old @JLabs 6374 have that 10mm step on the shaft and I can't slide the pulley on far enough to get proper gear alignment.

Be interesting to see what these look like inside, how big the stator is etc.

I think the front bearing is also why SK3 are so durable, they have a big bearing in  front that sits between the fan and the can. Most motors the can is just hanging off the rear of the shaft. So there is more potential for flex / vibration.

There isn’t a spec sheet as of yet, the stator and winding is the same as the 6374 190kv units. 
She checking with production on the 8mm shaft but indicated it maybe the only size available in that motor.

Also, we are at the # of units (30) 
That we can do with a logo or without? 
They are in production and we can add or delete the logo. 
I believe we are stuck with the 10mm shafts because they are already made. 
With 3-4 week lead ( first of December ) 
I miss understood her, the 50mm are in stock. 
But, I trust her on lead times. So first of December. 
ANY IDEAS ON A LOGO? 
currently at 30 units signed up. 
Also wouldn’t be a bad idea to group up on the pulleys needed.

Being a new guy who has been drooling over the builds on this forum for a few months now and am in the process of buying parts to build my own I have come to really like the look of motors with a logo. I think it gives the board a more custom look over an over the counter board or a cheap knock off from eBay or Amazon. I know some people like the stealth look with no logos but I like the in your face look.

So will be similar power to 6374 just more durable? 

What is taking up the extra 5mm in the diameter? If that is a thick steel can or thicker magnets it could result in more performance.

Ok., 
Because a few guys are interested in the 6374 MTO 190kv-HA and we can lump them in with this order I’m going to start a new group buy tread and sign up sheet. 
To keep them separate. 
The target price for these are 92$ ( group buy price for the US ) 
For our EU guys please wait until @pjotr47 
Posts the EU sign up. 
We are going to do our best to keep shipping and initial import fees (duties & taxes) to a minimum so @pjotr47   Doesn’t have to add much to get them to you. 

I also would like to say thank you guys for being interested in the group buy. We wanted to do something a bit more than just a discount for Black Friday. 
Benjamin @hyperIon2 has this idea for the group buy ( in the tradition of group buys ) and only charge what’s needed to get the products to the customers (community)  
As it stands we pay in bulk 90.5$ Each  for the NEW 6880 MTO SEALED 190kv motors 
And 
For the  6374 MTO ( none sealed ) 190kv  red/grey  in bulk 85$ each 

We are only charging a few dollars more for shipping and handling. 
 
 My brother and I wanted to think the esk8 community for give us a chance at the first of the year. ( less than 1 year ) 
We knew coming to you guys first could have been catastrophic , but a great many of you took a chance on us and I hope we did ok. 
We see a difference being made in the future and esk8 is at its core. 
 We have found what we want to be doing well into retirement. 
Thank you ESK8  community, you guys truly make it all possible. 

I have the second tread up shoulrtly.

From the states to a middle man in Brussels is covered in the price. Because I can’t properly gage post in the eu with taxes and duties. 
Once the eu orders arrive in Brussels he will get quotes for shipping and from him to you should be reasonable.  Once that has been determined we will let everyone know. But expect minimum shipping and what ever you country charges on imported goods.

30mm for the inner, 44mm for the outer diameter on usual 63mm motors.
If those now 43 and 59mm with m5 screws than it’s not gonna fit.

But that was the drawing to this motors, so 🤷‍♂️

how they get to this watt rating?
75a* 14s = 4410w

as we only use may 12s (usuall) that would be
75a* 12s = 3780w
my APS 8074s have more power @12s
and they even 800g less per motor.
```

## \#203 Posted by: banjaxxed Posted at: 2018-12-10T13:16:34.740Z Reads: 232

I read they were rated 6450w? Meaning that if you had a monster battery capable of supplying the discharge necessary it would equal about 17hp? For dual that is

Ps. How are the APS working out, there was a problem with noise afaik
```

## \#204 Posted by: Andy87 Posted at: 2018-12-10T13:21:04.789Z Reads: 233

that may be, but the motors only rated for 75a.
so as long as you use only 12s you will never ever get to the 6k+ watt and with it it wouldn´t give you any advantage over a smaller motor. only that it´s more heavy and more expensive

yeah, I follow the problem about the 8072 :disappointed_relieved: hope it's mostly on high kV ... I should test them before to send them to the drilling. I got them last Xmas in 60kv (but I'm still on the diy of my big hubs ...).

But this 8085 looks so rad and mad. The feeling when you hit the trigger should be kick ass ! (I mean if its like ride with 5065 then pass to 6374 with same kV same setup, you feel an amazing change, so passing from 6374/84 to 8085 should be insane). I don't but maybe if it is rated to 6240w at 14s with 75A, you could maybe try around 125Amps to get 6240W. I know it should be issue with heat or something like that, but if we could put around 90/100Amps for an sk3 ... this big boy may could handle +110/120 Amps for some acceleration...
(I'm probably wrong, but I wonder)

## \#208 Posted by: Andy87 Posted at: 2018-12-11T03:53:01.177Z Reads: 245

I was looking fo 8085 motors a time ago and I also was speaking with maytech about there motor. It was the unsealed version of this one and also rated to 75a only.
The said it’s the max Amp rating...but I don’t understand how this can be if the watt rating is way much higher. So the motor theoretically need to be able to handle higher voltage or higher currents than in the specks.
Still don’t understand.

I now went with the APS 8085.
They not sealed but with the 25% on the Black Friday it was a very very good deal.
The APS motors are rated to 150A and 15s by the way.

The batch that we ordered will ship out from Maytech in the next few days. 
They will be unbranded and have longer lead wires. 
As for speed you should get the same out of this motor as the 6374 190kv. Maybe a bit more. 
Your battery size and bms will determine what you can feed each motor. 
If your battery pack is chocked at 50a or 80a that’s all you will be able to supply the motors. Divided of course. 
These motors can run 65a each and up to 54v. 
If your rig doesn’t deliver the power the motors will not hit top speed.

We should be able to get a minimum of 10 easily with all the mtb builds here. Imo, this motor is the only potentially reliable alternative to the SK3 (proven crazy reliable for me). More power though + sensored.

Yes I realize that.  That's the kv I calculated for the battery pack I plan on using, I just rounded up :wink:  I have some TB 6380's, that are 170kv, but I figure since I'm going to be using a gear drive I'll just increase the ratio from like 2.5:1 up to 3:1 to make up for the increase.

If anyone wants a pair of new, unused silver Torque Boards 170kv 6380's shoot me a DM.

@hyperion1. Let us know if you'd consider a 170 kv group buy (eu/us). Maytech could take the price/reliability/performance crown for MTB.


Good way for them to cage interest and have the motors tested under brutal conditions ;)

There isn’t a spec sheet as of yet, the stator and winding is the same as the 6374 190kv units.

To find if it’s any more powerful u can get the motor km looking at its electrical resistance and kv/kt on the vesc tool.  The lower the kv and with less resistance the better  Other than that unless it has higher temp ability magnets it’s the same power ability.

From my understanding of how @hyperIon1 explained it before.  The 6880 is basically a 6374 with larger can to accommodate an extra bearing.  Its trying to accomplish a sealed motor with less heat issues.

It's been stated before that the stature size is pretty much identical. The performance specs listed are also identical to the 6374. They should be bigger compared to the SK3 and offer similar endurance due to the larger bearing, better perhaps due to this being sealed.

I think the big improvement is the rim bearing, I'm sure that makes the bell more stable and able to take a hit or two. Now we need to make them indestructible (or at least longer lasting) with a hardening process, better materials used in securing magnets and rings, higher temperature thresholds, the next step is to make what's here better.

75a is not really much.
So for average it would be 12s at 75a motor max or 3780 watt.

If that is the max rating than I can go with a 6384 motor too and save some weight.

It appears to be laminated wire all the way to the existing bullet connectors. I'm researching the best/easiest solution atm... which appears to be using solvent to melt the enamel away. I'll update here tonight when I get home (if I'm able to get it to work lol). 

For now, I would advise against cutting these wires unless you are experienced in soldering laminated wires!! Anyone with knowledge of this process, please share!!.

On a similar note, the 5.5mm connectors that come with the motors are the highest quality bullets I've ever seen! And the phase wires, while currently irritating me TREMENDOUSLY, seem extremely robust! Really haven't been this excited in a very long time. 

Or frustrated

I think they are just enameled phase wire extending out from the motor. it's best to desolder the existing bullets than cutting them off.

I've had decent luck, with really small enameled wire, with getting a big blob of solder on my biggest soldering iron tip, and dipping the wire.

For solder pots, if you go this way, get the smallest one! The big ones will need more solder, and take more time to heat up and cool down.

I bought the Tenma 150w on Amazon, as it looks a lot more robust than the generic blue and yellow ones. But it has no temperature control, and oh boy it gets way crazy hot. I bought a router speed control from harbor freight -- on the lowest setting it's still about 40w and still too hot, but much better. Sorry, I don't have a motor lead to test with!

EDIT it ended up costing a chunk, for the 63/37 solder bar, router speed control, and paste flux. But it makes tinning wire ends much much easier if doing a bunch, like custom motor phase wire lengths, or series connections for battery subpacks (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSIhIGkQOsA)

At this point I am wondering if this should be a split topic, but this magnet wire is tough as hell. Like, insanely tough, Nothing I've tried so far has had effect. Scraping, nothing. Soaked in Strip-x overnight, NOTHING. Torch and sandpaper, nada. Just brittle wires. 

I tried a make-shift solder bath with a torch and a 5.5 bullet female, and got a possibly viable result, this seems to be the most promising method so far @deucesdown , thanks for that. 
 
A thought occurs however: when the wire is cut, the tip is exposed and conductive. Anyone have an idea as to whether 'just the tip' of a wire is enough for an electrical connection? For this amount of current through a tiny amount of solder?? If it were a copper joint, no doubt, but solder? Kinda wishing I hadn't cut these, glad I only cut one motor...

These wires **do** speak well of the windings though!! Ain't a thing in the WORLD gonna short them out. F*cking durable insulation. 

I wonder if cutting at a steep angle would expose a sufficient amount of wire 🤔😭. I hate it!!

**edit:** I am failing at this with a freekin 240W weller gun.

With sufficient heat from a decent soldering iron and lots of solder should be able to melt the enamel off. you will see some black impurity flowing on the solder blob.

6880 motor cables are extended directly from inside because the hole is too small for 3 silicone cables. And it also has one advantage that it won't loose comparing to soldering silicone cables. 

I consulted our engineer how to remove the coating: 
1.  the easiest way is to grind each wire with sandpaper. 
2. https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/new-maytech-mto-6880-190kv-ha-c3-for-the-hard-core/74073/363?u=eileenmaytech  Please clean black impurity before solder new connectors.

Today I'll be trying something new, and dangerous. Frustrated again by the extreme quality of wire insulation in these motors (which is great, unless you wish to solder them), I've decided that I am going to use a molten-salt bath. Based on what I've been reading over the past few days, the most effective way to remove wire insulation seems to be molten LYE (sodium hydroxide) and table salt. Gotta be very hot, and risk of chemical burns is real. I will try to document this as much as possible today. but progress may be slow due to danger.

Started a separate thread about stripping the wires. Now that I'm back on topic, and have _both_ motors installed, let me say that I am truly astonished by the quality and power of this model. For the same current settings, these motors feel significantly more powerful than the 6374s I had previously. Wouldn't matter what they cost, I'd pay it.

Here's how i stripped the phase leads:

After spending some time looking at various 80xx motor options including Maytechs, I think this may be the sweet spot for ATB price/performance -
6880 160kv. The 80xx motors are pretty much twice the price which I don’t get (materials and effort x 2 is not) and the pre-order price has jumped a couple of times on the last couple of days which is a turn-off.

I have to admit I missed the boat on this GB. Next time..

For now I’ll stick with the 6374/6384 in the hope there will be a future GB

I have a shipment of motors going to the UK Monday and a shipment coming into the states at the same time. They will be coming off a small holiday at the factory. 

Here are some factory updates on the motors that will be produced from now on. including this batch. 

all motors will now have the correct 2.0mm JST sensor connector and motors in size 5055-6374 will have 4.0mm bullet connectors and the bigger 6880 and 8085 motors will have the 5.5mm bullets.

this batch they made the pase wires same lienght as the sensor, I know The next batch the sensor wire will be longer than the phase wires. 

As for a full custom Group Buy a minimum order OF ONE TYPE MOTOR to have custom kv, logo, wires are #50

Im not sure that applies to the shaft, I can ask. really its a matter of approaching them with a list of requirements and seeing what they are willing to do.

What kinds of things are y’all doing that need motors this big? Honestly, I feel like I’m missing something. 

After I tasted 4wd performance, I’m pretty happy with readily available drive trains in quad. Probably more expensive, but parts share wear the peak stresses and last longer. 

Obviously, always push the limits because that what we collectively do. 

I skate a lot of streets in San Diego, I like think I’m pretty fast. I still haven’t maxed out the board, and even with 2.6:1 gearing it has enough torque accelerate past car on steep hills in the area from dead stop. (I did loose a drag race to a street bike and a Ferrari tho 😔)

my limiting factors now are batteries that can deliver the amps for hard starts. 

Are your builds a lot lighter because 2wd not 4? Are y’all 250lbs bruisers doing backflips at the pump track? Do you use these at peak power often?

Honest questions, not calling anyone out.  I think maybe a build philosophy difference here. But if you all are doing cool hood rat shit without me, I’m going to be pissed when I see some of you in Colorado in June. 

I mean, I get it;  I would bug the shit out Dave for mounts that fit Falcon Heavy thrusters if I could get a pair... or 4, because Power.

Well, my build weighs a lot (15.8Kg) and I am modestly out of shape (84Kg) and I usually ride with my dog. So what's the point of these motors for me? Hard to say, other than that I just love hardware. I also love to have a front row seat in the evolution of said hardware. Plus they look rad, run quieter than anything else I've used, and at these GB prices you can't beat them 

My opinion anyway lol

As far as I know these have a stator similar to a 6374, it’s just the can is larger to accommodate the large front bearing. The main benefit is increased durability. 

They may be a bit more powerful than a 6374 though, just not quite as much as the size may indecate.

What they offer is an almost perfect isolation between the bits of debris that might get into a motor. If only for contact rubber seals, these might be perfect motors

Ok,

I have an Update on the Currently forming GB for 6880 motors and the Etoxx drive. If you scroll up to post 33 You will see where I was reminded that a level 3 or above member can DO group buys. At first, I thought he was simply pointing out that NOT anyone can DO GB on the forum. Well he was not, he was eluding to the fact that I do not meet the criteria for this Level 3 event. Now In all fairness, I simply didn’t know and it’s not easy to determine with the info provided on your own profile stats and the vague requirement description given.

Now, what did I just say?

We can NOT orchestrate GROUP BUYS on the forum because:

 
Now, What does this Mean? I must hurriedly read 218 post or treads? I really don’t have the time. I’m not sure and im not waiting for it to roll over or accumulate to the proper release point for level 3 access.

What about the Group Buys?

As far as I can tell it can be done through the [Hyperionesk8.com](http://Hyperionesk8.com) website if properly set up.

[Cory@hyperionsystems.org](mailto:Cory@hyperionsystems.org)

[Benjamin@hyperionsystems.org](mailto:Benjamin@hyperionsystems.org)

I will post information on the front page of the site with links to the products created for these buys. final specs and options and instructions on how to place the order on the website.

Because of the Transaction fees from PayPal if used you will need to add 6% if you chose to pay this way. Furthermore, you have the same protection through your card issuing bank and website (Shopify) for fraud and disputes at no extra cost. Please consider this option for payment to save yourself some money. But the choice is yours.

I will confirm info on motors 6880 on the webpage.

Etoxx helical drive prices

2 kits to choose from:

Kit 1

(raw aluminum) Matrix II Helical drive 10/40 kit

includes rear truck extenders

w/aluminum base plates $670 shipped

w/o base plate $570 shipped

Kit 2

(Black Anodized) Matrix II Helical drive 10/40 kit

includes rear truck extenders

w/aluminum base plates $770 shipped

w/o base plate $670 shipped

saving up to $300 off regular price if purchased alone

these prices are solid and our MOR is almost meet. so the more the marrier. This is confirmed by Jens all payments have to be made before anything ships. some variants have production times.

Feel free to PM me with questions and I don’t see the need to make a fuss over this with the admins, they are following the rules as we all should, I will have more topics to start and some really cool demo builds to showcase for Our MBS eMTB kits and pre-built line.

I will start a topic specifically about them, prices and options. please look for it. Titled MBS eMTB kits

Got round to testing my motors today before cutting the shafts down to fit my gear drives. 2 things I noticed:

1. They do have temp sensor and I was able to see this reading in the vesc app :slight_smile:

2. I brought 4 motors, 2 boxes of 2. I found that both motors from one box have the large wheel bearings secured to the motor bell. However in both motors from the other box the large bearing does not seem to be properly fitted into the motor bell causing it to not spin with the motor bell.

https://photos.app.goo.gl/48tQbBBW35Yq3Xrs9

Im wondering what other peoples motors do? can you spin the large bearing without spinning the motor bell or are they firmly fixed together?

Does anyone know if this is correct and acceptable or is this going to become a problem in the long run?

@EileenMaytech have you seen this before?

Thanks, its easy to see now. That can't be normal, normally bearings would be press fit or glued. 

Will have to see what Maytech say about it. 

@PatRocks how hard was it to remove the can from the front bearing on the one you disassembled?  Press fit or glue?

If the tolerance is still good and they don't rattle maybe just a spot of glue is all that is needed?

Relative to pulling apart other motors, it's exactly the same. The bearings are fixed to the stator, there is minute free play which allows the bell to spin, without the bearing spinning. It's obvious if you think about it: bearings cannot be pressed on to or into an object by the opposite (inner/outer) race without marring the races. I.e.: press a motor bearing in via the inner race, and its fucked. You have to apply the force to the race that is facing the friction of insertion (lol?)... unless both inner/outer race have the equivalent pressure applied and ball alignment stays right lol!

If there wasn't any free play, either the motor could never come apart, and/or the the bearing could never be installed. 

Understood? Simple, right?

@PatRocks So your saying the difference between my motors is due to tolerance and that the outer race is only a lose fiction fit so that they can be disassembled easily. 

The makes sense as you may need them to be serviced . . . however my concern is that if the bell spins without the bearing spinning then the bearing is not actually supporting the bell and eventually this will cause wear. 

Additionally if there is space between the bell and bearing then I guess the motor is no longer sealed?

There is a smaller gap between the motor's internals and the outside world than I've seen before, but no it isn't gas-tight. Also, I don't believe in metal shields for esk8 bearings. I would have chosen contact-rubber-seals for this application... but I haven't founded any manufacturing companies yet. 

@ducktaperules , the 3 internal bearings support the shaft and attached bell. The outer (4th) bearing prevents skewed alignment between the motor shaft and bell center points from impacts and etc. And even without rubber seals, to me it seems to be a great way to keep anything larger than micro-dust (seriously) from getting into the motor.

Seriously great way to close the gap, just my thoughts!

EDIT: These motors are very well SHIELDED, but they are not SEALED. If you submerged one, it would fill up with water. But if you skate above the surface, you'll be okay (which is basically all I do, metaphorically speaking)

The bearing contacting the bell is its purpose! I definitely don't recommend locktite in this one single case. It's there to keep things on track, and can pretty much remain stationary with the motor spinning and no worries. Hit a bump, and the can is supported! Smooth sailing, and the bearing is stationary. It's more of an added support than anything else but don't locktite it

I have checked with our engineer. 
The outer ring of the bearing cannot be glued to motor can. Otherwise the motor can not be taken apart for checking or repair, and it will be a one-time motor.
Because motor can diameter has tolerance in production. Some bearings outside can turn and some can't. Its role is to support motor can. It does not affect the motor using. Please be assured.

This is applied in the factory to balance the motor. Motors are hard to machine to perfect balance so A machine spins the motor bell and works out where and how much weight needs to be added to balance it perfectly. It looks odd but it's usually a sign of a good motor cause cheep motors don't get balanced like this.
