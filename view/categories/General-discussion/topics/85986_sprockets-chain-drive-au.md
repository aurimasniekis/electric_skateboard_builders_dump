where abouts are people getting their sprockets and chains from for a chain drive setup. 
Prefer a local shop in AU. looking for a 13T/40T setup

thanks, sadly the sites down for maintenance i think. would you know if these sprockets require any modifications from the site?

This is the most common one used in Aus but you can also get smaller motor sprockets off aliexpress to give you more torque. I run this with a 10t motor sprocket on 100mm wheels with dual 6374's and this gives me heaps of punch and a top speed over 50km/hr. I also buy a generic pitbike chain off ebay or aliexpress and have a chainbreaker that allows me to make whatever length chain I need for my application.

ah thanks i will check this out. im looking at a 3.5 ratio roughly but im not sure if this will give me enough torque. but it does give me the speed im after but a chain breaker will be ideal with a few different sprockets if they are cheap enough so i can play around with the ratios to get something i like

im building this for a DIY Trampa build with 175mm Superstar hubs with a goal of reaching 70kmh

The chain to use is 25h. The chain breakers are super cheap and are fiddly but work well. You simply push the rivets out, make the size you want then push them back in. This is the tool.

As for 70 km/h on pneumatic tyres - you will have to have 4WD and heaps of power. That is absolutely crazy. Have you ever actually gone at those speeds before? You could adapt these sprockets to fit your wheel but will almost certainly have to redrill the holes in them to make them suit your application. Just make sure they are smaller that your wheel diameter.

thanks for the links, the chain looks pretty good at a cheap price too, issue is i have found suppliers but the shipping cost is more than double the product cost just to ship to AU with fedex for some reason so getting them imported from the US and UK is kinda out of the question. its like $130 USD for $50 AUD in parts if your lucky

Also it is a lot easier to go bigger on the motor sprocket than on the wheel when going for speed. For example if you wanted to use that kit with the 27 wheel sprocket putting on a 15t 8mm motor sprocket would get you to 66km weighed or a 16t would get you to your 70km weighted target using 100mm wheels. if you were using pneumatics you could use maybe a 12 or 13t motor sprocket to get your top speed. Also good to note is that the wheel sprocket I listed fits a standard diameter skate bearing so they are really easy to centre depending on what type of trucks you use.

Ahh ok cool, im looking at using neumatic tyres 175mm from trampa. i took this into consideration when picking the sprocket setup 

im trying to get 

13T/40T
12T/42T
14T/52T

but its hard finding the right parts, where most sprockets are already pre drilled to fit their own applications. im trying to aim for 13/40t or 12/42t so i can get some better ground clearance with the chain and not stress the motor too much. but issue is finding these specific parts for a reasonable price >.<

[ZachTetra](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/u/ZachTetra) linked a site up above but it seems to be down for maintenance. im just hoping they have what i need to fit the SK8 motors with a keyway at a reasonable price.

Have you used this site to calculate your top speeds using those ratios? They are all way over the speed you want using those ratios and you will find that it will really limit your torque uphills especially for a mountain board.
http://toddy616.blogspot.com/2013/07/electric-skateboard-calculator.html
As far as loading up the motor if the ratio is the same the load is the same regardless isn't it?

This is the type of motor sprocket I use. You can get it in a variety of teeth. Yes it looks bad but in fact works really well. I have put hundreds of km on these and they are bullet proof.

well the thing is im not sure what the ratio is meant to be. i heard anything between 3-5 ratio is good. so i went with a 3.5 to get desired speed.

what would you recommend the minimum for the ratio to be. i do plan on getting 2 kits, as i live in a suburban area where we dont have any hills apart from an overpass i go over to get to the next town for a ride, but its all flats there.  when i do decide to take it in the bush i will be swapping out the sprockets and chain for a much higher torque drive.

yeah that is a good idea. you could use this sprocket with a 10t motor sprocket and you would make 78km/h weighted then swap it for a more torquier setup when doing hills. Something like this

You can also check out a local bearing & power transmissions mob, most will have a catalog and you can pick out what you want but likely you will need to do finish machining so might not be viable for you.

out of curiosity how have people found the durability of the 25 size chain ?
I was doing some research the other day and came across the chart that had all the load ratings ect of chains and it sort of indicated that 25 size was not overly strong, yeah might not be pushing huge loads before tractor is the issue but riding close to the ground I think if they are not strong they would be subject to road impacts

I have used the 25h chains for commuting hundreds of km and have never had a breakage or slip. They use the same chain on pit bikes which put out a lot more power so they are definitely up to the task for our purpose. I also run them fairly slack and wax them to stop load on the motor and minimise friction and mess.

Honestly the easiest set up I see is getting the standard 14:27 setup of aliexpress and putting on a 10t motor sprocket which gives you 87km/h weighted top speed with 175 wheels. You can get the parts easy and just need to drill a few hole to fit the sprocket to your wheels

Awesome to hear they have been holding up

Sorry to correct you but Pitbikes eg mini dirt bikes quite often around the 110-160cc range normally use a 420 or 428 chain which is about 8 times stronger then #25 chain from memory.
Pocket bikes, like the little 50cc 2 strike mini road bikes may use a #25 chain

I use sk3 6374s on 10s and the chains have been bulletproof. I have a lot of hills and can comfortably do 60km if need be without a hassle. They never skip. I guess if you think about it this way - people quite happily use belts which are quite a bit weaker than a 25h chain. I think chains are a step up in strength over belts. But all I can go on is my experience with them. I will leave the hard data to those who know what they are talking about 😊

bearing &amp; power transmissions
[/quote]

im mostly after chain due to the strength of them and can be repaired over replaced on the spot. chain breaks no problem, carry a few spare lengths and a chain breaker and your good to go. belts need to be replaced, duno which is easier. but i would imagine with a chain you wouldnt even need to take the board apart from it if you have clear access to the sprockets
```

## \#31 Posted by: MasterSpoon Posted at: 2019-03-04T06:25:59.289Z Reads: 40

```
I'm not sure that replacing chain on the spot would be easier unless you already had some spare chains the correct length and a master link. Even then a belt is probably easier and cleaner.

The benefit of chain drive it that it's not likely to break so you don't need spares. It won't slip under power or braking.

When I said bearing and power transmission mob I was talking about someone like this
https://www.bsc.com.au
They will have a catalog where you can pick what you want but quite often they will be designed as general purpose so finish machining like the bore size need to be done after purchase and they can be more expensive.

I agree the chains don’t break especially if you keep an eye on their wear. I do not however recommend putting a master link in there as I did this initially and had no end of trouble with link catching on the sprocket and coming off. Using the chain breaker and setting the length that way is the best way to go.

noted ill get a chain breaker instead of a master link thanks the site  that was linked above, the guy there is super helpful and is willing to change some parts around in the kits, since i'm looking at getting a few sets from here [www.overion.fr](http://www.overion.fr)  they seem reasonably priced for the kit with no headache of having to source each part individually. a cheaper price would be ideal but what your getting here seams reasonable, just depends on shipping now. with the configuration i was looking at ![Sk8Life3|293x90](upload://nfutWs4Ep8qWRePE2tA9h394fml.png) 

these are the desired results with my config, these are a little off but about roughly right. Gear Ratio, speed and Sprocket Teeth might end up getting 9/42 for mountain boarding that will give me a 4.66 ratio for good torque and on my daily i would use 10/35 to get my desired speed for a daily ride

during my build process i plan on creating a new thread and showing my progress on both builds. they will be almost identical apart from asthetics 


12s8p might even go a 12s10p if i can find a case big enough to fit everything for a top mount, was going to do a custom under mount and cast it out of fibreglass with a 3d printed mold but i think just mounting a waterproof case on top would be easier

so far the only thing we have left to get is the board itself from trampa when they eventually come back in stock... which we have been waiting over 4 months for, cells, remote and the drive train and a case for the battery i'm building.


appreciate all the help guys. i think ill end up getting the chain drive from www.overion.fr

depending on price for shipping. which im hoping isnt going to be a ridiculous amount
