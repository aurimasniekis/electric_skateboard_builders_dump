Past few days have been pretty rough. All I think about is esk8. Does anyone else feel empty when your not able to esk8?

Really want to mess around with my FOCBOX unity but I got hit by a car last Wednesday while testing the new hubs... I was so excited to get my controller and now it's just sitting in a box after all the time it took to be produced and delivered. :face_with_head_bandage:

I got my hands on a campus cruiser but my mom didnâ€™t want me to ride it so my dad took it to his storage unit and I donâ€™t have anything to skate. I just feel so empty because Iâ€™m used to going on a 5-6 mile ride everyday when I have free time. Now I have nothing to do in my free time!

Thank you, I am doing quite well given the circumstance. I was very lucky to walk away with a fractured and dislocated shoulder. I can no longer tinker with the board due to the injury and I miss that just as much as riding.

Oh shoot man, wish a fast healing, will never forget the time I couldnâ€™t skate for about a year. Ran into a guardrail when I was downhill riding at a new place I found. Broke my leg, and I damaged my knees. If that guard rail wasnâ€™t there, I would probably not been here considering the other side of the guardrail was a huge ditch with a ton of rocks.

if you on that point than esk8 was too much in your life. never good to be fixed to one activity to 100%.
Sure I missed skating in the winter when my motors broke, but I have plenty lot of other stuff to do. 

Do you have a girlfriend? if yes, than you shoulnÂ´t get bored at all. if no, than find you one!

Go to gym or learn another language.

Start to hustle some money for your next build.

Order part. 

Easy thing.

Meeee! Last few months had stupid rain constantly. This is SoCal! DaFuk is happening?!? Work was on the slow end so I normally wouldâ€™ve skated more if it wasnâ€™t for the rain. Then rain finally goes a away and guess what? Work is being a biatch and havenâ€™t slowed down.  I might sneak in a 30 minute ride here and there. But nothing too fun.

Dude. Tell me about it! Every day off would be a rainy day or a day where it isnâ€™t really a day off.... Im resorting to short night rides lately.  Less speed because its dark but more space because of the lack of cars. Actually heading out for a quick one soon

@Mikenopolis @Bobby I am right there with you! It never fails, the week starts nice and sunny, I plan a Friday ride with some friends. Then comes the Wednesday forecast: "yeah, it's going to pour starting tomorrow evening and all through the weekend."

What a great night ride!!! Carving in the middle of the street. Some randos tried stopping me to ask questions about the board but aint got no time for that.... gotta skate. So is 8wh/mile good?  Btw, Im very happy I do a nerdy ass checklist before I ride. Found a loose wheel nut from when I cleaned my bearings. So far converting from hub motors to belt drive has been worth the headaches

@Mikenopolis I feel you bro. That rain sucked that's why I water  proofed my board and did a 17 Mile run in the rain here in socal HD that week. Now I have her all torn up for a 4x4 rebuild. It's been 1week since I've road and yes @KaramQ my withdrawals are hardcore. Like a nicotine or heroin addict trying to quit. I had my wife drive the golf cart the other day while I stood on the back just so I can get a thrill. Tried to use my my easy up tarp to fly away in the wind. Just trying to keep my adrenaline up!!! Haha

I totally agree. They advertised hubs as having no or less maintenance. But at least belt itâ€™s easily fixable or just replace parts. 

Damn it Brian. Iâ€™m pretty sure you are the only one here thatâ€™s fully converted to only esk8. When I ride a nearby bike trail I started looking at the homes next to the trail. Really want to move to a house right next to the trail for easy access. That trail almost gets me to the office

This is a really, really silly thing to say.  It rains outside.  Sometimes you'll have to ride in the rain.  If your skate can't handle it, [it's defective or not built right](https://forum./t/riding-your-electric-skateboard-in-the-rain-is-a-really-dumb-idea/32/3?u=b264).  Can't just not go to work/school/grocer today because it started raining. :man_facepalming:

I think you need to stop talking like that. People should skate to their ability; riding in wet weather can be very dangerous. If you believe that you don't feel safe then you stop and find another way to your destination. End of story.

If your running a water resistant, pneumatic build, you can, Iâ€™ve fell numerous times in the rain because of my wheels slipping. Not only that, one drop of water in a battery will cause a short at any time

Its literally not but its not worth arguing with you. Electric skateboarding is dangerous and you should not be so blase about people taking unnecessary risk. Just because you are okay with it, it does not make it okay for others.

Driving cars is dangerous and you should not be so blasÃ© about people taking unnecessary risk.  Anytime it rains or snows, everyone should stay home from work and school.

See how stupid that sounds?

Just go slow.  If you know it's slick, then you know to go super-duper slow and don't make unneeded trips -- aka joyrides.

Aside from the constant heavy rain, my board has been inoperable for about a month. I've been getting by with my old wowgo and kick pushing a tayto. It's not enough though and I miss 30 mile rides deeply.
