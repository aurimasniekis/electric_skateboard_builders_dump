It can be a bitch because there's no set screw and plenty of thread lock or something like it on the key. 

Luckily Autozone carries a small, very well built gear puller that works with the 8mm bore in these pulleys. 

This is how it's done without a torch or hammer and without making a single scratch on the pulley:

Battery terminal puller - $4.99

I used a Philips bit to push on the shaft
