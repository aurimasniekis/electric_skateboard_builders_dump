More spam incoming....

I just wanted to say thanks to everyone here for an awesome year. There is no other place where I could meet such a passionate and helpful group of people, and without you guys I'd still be pushing or walking up every hill In my area (uuiurrrgh).

I really hope that 2019 Is full of @brenternet doing weird stuff with his nipples and everyone here making awesome gear that keeps my wallet empty, but maintains the massive grin on my face whenever I step on my board.

Merry Christmas from Australia!!!
