Had a pretty bad collision with a car. Lady from on coming lane made a left on green, and I didn't have time to stop. ![IMG_20180312_082758|666x500](upload://hwIChllMLY4Hv2kAVHKoKUxyzPz.jpg) 

We traded names and phone numbers and went our separate ways. I usually take the burden of action upon myself when it comes to safety because you can't count on anyone else to provide for your safety. In the end it's my dumbass on a motorized skateboard.  However,  not sure what I could have done differently to avoid this wreck.

Just happened to me yesterday dude! A brand new Chevy Yukon coming out of the lot plowed right into me  head on and I had absolutely no time to stop. The dude didn't think a skateboard could be going 30mph. Luckily I wear a helmet and gloves which is what took the most punishment. The new trucks looks worse than me. Glad you're alright!!!

Yeah I'm riding a boosted board. Was going under 18mph. Had time to slam on breaks so collision was less than that. Been building a board here hoping to get better brakes. Grateful for my helmet.

Looks like you...
Made a dent.

Good to hear you're mostly okay, judging by the size of that crater left on the SUV. Must have been some impact.

It's not always you that's responsible. Sometimes it can just be other people not paying attention, which causes the accident. That's why safety gear is so important. You can be as good as you need to be, but somebody else, who's actions you can't control might be the responsible one.

@Acklavidian 
I'm glad you're safe!
I bet you scared the shit out of her when you shattered that window!

@SeanHacker
He saw you and still pulled out? Dick move.  Hope that scrape is the extent of your injuries!


We are going to see these types of interactions more often, and more often than not we (eskaters) are going to be drawing the short straw, regardless of who is at fault.  We need to figure out how to ride defensively in a way that is appropriate for our gear.  As a community, do we begin to come up with a list of good, high-viz gear so that drivers actually see us on the road?

Glad everyone who had a car vs skate accident is fine.

So exactly what happens financially in these situations since we only have CAR insurance. If the other drive is **FOUND** at fault, his/her insurance pays for the damages and medical bills for you. But what happens if they determine it's the skater's fault? I'm assuming it's just out of pocket paying for damages done on the car?

IMO OP has it right. Can't depend on anyone to not hit us. We have to save our own skin. This is not likely to change. We all must ride as if everyone out there is actively trying to kill us.

I did notice though that I have way fewer almost-died moments since @psychotiller sold me his purple TSG Pass.

I don't know how the law is in different parts of the world, but where I am (Australia) the car driver is always at fault. pedestrians **always** have right of way and regardless of how stupid the pedestrian is, or if they caused the accident, the car driver is always at fault.
and by law a skateboarder is considered a pedestrian.

Glad you're not bent out of shape like that car, as a community it's time to start adopting the safety practices experienced motorbike riders use in terms of danger avoidance. Sometimes you can do nothing about it but there is a mindset that can interpret driver awareness or lack of.

Safety gear is imperative and while slowing down in general can be a useful tool you need to know what others can do to you with your trajectory and start running the numbers on the worst case scenario as a reflex, you cannot expect car drivers to observe correctly

I have a Bern helmet and I plan on getting a full face  for extra protection.  Also I feel that it may help visually break away from the traditional skateboard look and hopefully gain a more attentive glance from drivers. I think full face registers more as motorcycle than skater at first glance. Also I'm going to get some gloves with the skid plate on the palm that i see people get for downhill. I want to try and practice sliding to a stop by getting the board sideways in front of me and holding my weight up with my hand sliding behind. Kinda like a snowboard but more horizontal. I see the downhill kids do it and want to adopt this to flat ground for safety purposes when I need to stop and/or turn abruptly. I know I hear a lot of people on here recomend foot stopping but while this is good for a break outage I don't think it's as realistic to combine breaking with one foot and electrical-break with your other foot still on the board. My crotch cant handle the forces well enough. If I can get it down I'm gonna go full asshat and stop like this non-stop to hopefully reinforce reflex response and confidence in it's use cases.

Either way with my braking wheels on the back I don't know that taking my weight off the back of the board and braking with one foot would be more effective than braking with my entire weight on the board.

The only thing you could have done is ride all over the place.. and do a windmills with your spare arm every few seconds.

Glad you skated away from that one! 


You can wear a  hi vis helmet jacket and pants with lights all over, and cars will still violate your right of way..

You can minimize how often it happens by moving around more in your lane.

On my supermoto, I ride all over the lane, on the left, then the right, and back to the left side, and never at a steady speed..
Always accelerating or decelerating. 

Almost every time a car shows up on a side street, or a left turner in the suicide lane, I stand up then sit back down.


Getting drivers to see you is only part of the equation, you need to give them some context so they can accurately judge your speed..


No way to give them the info they need if you are riding at a steady speed in a straight line.

Even if they see you, your speed cant be judged accurately.

They may see you, even make eye contact with you, and they will still go and pull out or turn in front of you..

It's because your visible cross section while you are in a steady path of travel is not enough to go on.

Just not enough info, no context. You are a small dot blending into their 180° field of vision.


A quick bob and weave, just carve back and forth and all of a sudden, they can see you and will be able to judge your speed and direction more accurately.






Think of it like fishing with a lure..

You can drag a lure straight and steady, and fish won't even see it. The lure just blends in with the background..

When you change the direction and speed of the lure, now they can see it because it's erratic, and not moving straight.

It was the purple. Prior, I was wearing a black snowboarding helmet. People would look right through me. Now with the purple full face, people do a double take to figure out what the hell I am, evaluate and respond properly. Most of the time. I actually have a remote activated car horn built into my board, but have used it maybe once since going purple. I didn't even realize this was happening for a good while. I was like, "everyone is so nice these days..."

Based on this experience, I think adding lighting to the body or helmet would significantly increase safety.

I knew this was the case statistically from motorcycle safety classes, but didn't really notice on a motorcycle (I have a yellow helmet and a gray helmet).

Bingo. And from motorcycle safety class, they taught us to always have an "out". So I'm planning for them to make their move, and have an escape plan. I look back every 3 seconds or so to know which way I can swerve. Plan A, B an d C.

This lady hit me in a school zone while I had a green light and was in a bike lane also passing through a crosswalk. She admitted to me that she didn't see me because she was too close behind the car turning in front of her. She went because they went and trusted they would have enough time as the person in front did. I dodged the first car but couldn't turn hard enough to dodge 2 cars in a row.  Even if i did I would have had an even harder time dodging the neutral ground behind her. If I would have clipped that neutral ground curb it would have thrown me in to on coming traffic. I ran out of options and took the hit.

Their insurance agent called me today to get my statement.  During this process she asked me if I was injured. I told her that while my injuries haven't yet presented any cause for worry my immediate concerns are the damages to my things. My shoes, and jacket were ripped. More importantly a helmet should be replaced after significant impact events. After she heard this she suggested I file a personal injury claim to replace those things. I wanted to post this here so that the community can be aware of these options when these things happen.

Well I'm sure that because I am considered a pedestrian they just want to cover their butts. I'm sure in this process I'll sign something that will in effect prevent me from taking further action. So screwing me over right now just looks like them ensuring that I won't take it further. I don't want the trouble of pressing charges so I take this little win over whatever long strung out court saga it would take to get things otherwise. I agree with you but because I was a pedestrian with the right of way in a green light intersection, in a school zone there isn't much they can do to me. So the person getting screwed over will be the other party.

some dude followed jake home to yell at him after cutting him off in traffic the other day. He literally pulled up into my yard and was yelling at him. 

He didn't see me behind the bench soldering stuff, and when i came around i just kind of stared at him. Then i told him to walk. Loudly. Sort of like DMX barking. 

he didn't know what to do with that so he kept arging with jake who kept responding. 

I turned around and told jake to shut up. then i barked WALK at the guy again and he started twitching funny. 

I don't think people realize that in florida if i feel threatened i can kill a man in my driveway and get away with it. I was very tempted to that day, as some douchbag rolled into my crib and started kicking my puppies. 

My point is, you can't trust anyone in a car period. Its our job to stay defensive.

Very much so. New Orleans has some of the worst drivers, worst roads, and worst street layout. I knew when I got my board that it's my dumbass on this thing. Now really I do think that its an unparalleled transportation tool. Green, no parking, helps decongests streets, more maintenance friendly, safer, and all around cheeper than a car... But the one trade off (and it's a big one) is my personal safety. And it's not due to my carelessness. Its the ones you share the road with. People here toss every close call up to "its your dumbass on a skateboard" as they put it to me on occasion. And that's the level of disregard they approach my safety on the street. Rarely is anything their fault. It's your fault for being in their way. And I understand this every time I get on the board. So I don't expect to get any reservations from any other road users. In fact it's best I assume they all secretly wish I would wreck so they can film it and get YouTube famous. Oh wait they probably are...

I think I would have reported it because I’m a firm believer that if everyone does the right thing there would be less crashes but also there would be less lawsuits. I would never sue just to sue but if someone runs me off the road because they are texting or taking selfies that will be an expensive selfie

I didn't really go out for money. They just asked me to make a statement and when I did they offered me a pain and suffering after I told them some of my stuff was damaged. In my state anything outside of a car, truck or motor cycle you are considered a pedestrian. And pretty much if you hit a pedestrian it's your fault. I think the insurance company just wanted to make sure I wasn't going to sue or claim some bad injury or something.

Yea, they're really careful to make sure you sign to agree to the settlement so you don't sue them for more later. I didn't realize til later that my Michael Korrs jacket got all scratched up on the arm I fell on and my side where I slid against the concrete. I would've got them to pay for that too. I'm reminded every time I where it now. Just got it probably a month before the accident

A good rule of thumb is to distrust ANYTHING the insurance company does or says. They are never acting in your best interest. Don’t sign anything and don’t say anything over the phone.
