I have a virtual reality remote and 
I want to connect it to my electric longboard if so this would change the game. it connects through Bluetooth so maybe put a Bluetooth receiver on vesc and maybe it will work

I'm sure it would be possible to use a Bluetooth receiver, but what does the VR remote look like? Wearing a headset while skateboarding is probably not a good idea...

That is not my intent I just want to use it like a DIY nunchuck controller I have one of the generic brands
