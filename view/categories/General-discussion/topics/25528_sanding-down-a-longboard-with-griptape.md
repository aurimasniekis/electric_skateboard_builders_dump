Hello everyone,

I'm making my own esk8 but I have some questions about customizing my longboard.
The result I would like to get is something similar as I saw on this forum a couple days ago:
https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/flatlinecustoms-agent-orange-40-arbor-axis-single-sk3-6374-motor-12s-lipo-4-x-3s-5000mah-vesc/2037?source_topic_id=25437

I was thinking to buy a longboard, remove the griptape and sand it down to have a nice wood finish. I'll use some spray to have enough grip afterwards and perhaps add a logo on the board.

I was thinking of buying the following board.<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/6/b/6b884f16e9aa2b5d71b4fb328d3130be730b1b45.jpg" width="690" height="232">

As I can get this board pretty cheap, I would also change the wheels to bigger orange ones, after mounting the trucks on the bottom.
Do you guys think the wood under the paint and grip tape will have a nice look? Or should I buy a good looking wooden deck from the start?
Or what do you recommend ?

Thanks in advance.

It would probably be easier and cheaper to find a blank deck and then get a sheet of clear griptape to put over it.

You can use a heat gun to remove grip tape without having to sand it, the heat will release the glue and it will come off clean.  You might need a little goof-off on the edges, but no need to sand to remove grip tape.
