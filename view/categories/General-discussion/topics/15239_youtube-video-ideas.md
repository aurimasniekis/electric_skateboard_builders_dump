I'd love to make some more eboard videos but am lacking ideas. If you have any videos you want to see being made, suggest them here!

Bike vs eSk8? I feel like a lot of people don't see the user of an electric board compared to a cheaper, larger Bike.

Except make the other ones slightly slower, without making them suspicious (one pulley tooth less, one battery cell less, etc). ;)

some ideas

- cool esk8 routes in your town
- latest upgrades on your esk8
- the process of the building your esk8
- reviews of similar components (controllers, bearings, wheels)
- tutorials to help other people to make their boards (how to configure the vesc)

this is what i do on my youtube channel :)

I like the build videos where the footage speed is increased, so a 3 hour build ends up being a 20 min video.

I would love to see skate videos of famouse historic places...Castles, churches, etc.

I've got one of a ride through the university were I live going up in a couple of days, my editing software crapped out. .
