Hi Guys,

I ordered 2 Enertion FOCBoxes on June 29th, and they still haven't gotten here yet lol. I contacted Enertion support a few days ago and they said it would be another week till they got here, and I checked the tracking number which had plenty of updates and stuff. I was just wondering if this is normal for Enertion. These FOCBoxes are the last thing I need for my build.

My last focboxes I think I waited around 4 months? Just something I have become used to.

Holy shit that's terrible! Honestly once someone else makes an ESC as good as the FOCBOX (there will probably be lots in a few months after VESC 6 comes out!) I bet everyone's gonna ditch Enertion.

I cancelled my focbox order a day after placing it when I realized it wouldn't ship for an unknown amount of time. Ordered the direct FET controllers from Esk8.de and they where at my door in under 2 weeks.

I've been running 12s FOC with 0 issues for a couple hundred km now

Both the VESC6 and the ¬´clones¬ª have been on the market for a long time now. Both better than the current Focbox. :grinning:

Yeah I was pretty pissed about my order to they told me to wait another wk another wk and another wk every time I asked. I mean I had to ask to get updates. I'm more upset about this than waiting time. I eventually cancelled it. U prob have to wait at least a wk. Even then who knows when. Whoever was doing my inquires was very rude too.(not mentioning here) overall was bad experience.

Yes I was notified that it was refunded. Even this took me long I had to ask 2 times. The rude guy didn't do his job and I had to come back and ask other helper, a wk later to resolve it. And it was done less than 12hrs.

I know he doesn't represent the enertion. And I understand the situation of enertion at the moment. Partially I was upset for waiting as well and was being emotional. But he shouldn't done that. 

Anyways everything is okay now. 

Tnx for asking collins

Actually shipping is not taking longer than usual. Its happening because most of the customers are not able to get tracking updates using 17track website automatically.

You guys have to select the carrier manually or use trackingmore to get updates of your parcel
