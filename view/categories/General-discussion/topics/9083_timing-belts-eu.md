Anyone got a EU seller to buy some timing belts? I only find some oversea sellers :slight_smile:

Still not really finding it. Also the oversea factory is only selling the 265-5M-12 with 53 teeth on the belt. 
Enertions belts have 55 teeth on it. If anyone find a good eu source please let me know :)
Worst case is ordering oversea and pay import tax.

Can't seem to find the 12mm anywhere actually. in EU they jump from 9mm to 15...
Hard to find the 265mm length too.
Do the teeth actually matter if the length and spacing is ok?

I have the same problem. Can't seem to find the 12mm and definatly not with 55 teeth. I also don't understand why 2 belts with the same spec have different amount of teeth.

rs components

Thx! RS components only offers 9mm or 15 wide belts. I need a 12mm.
Belting online also offer 9mm and 15mm as standard but you can manualy typ a specific width. I will try this one.
Thx for the help!

Cool. Got a mail from belting online that  they have 12mm in stock so you just have to type in the field for the width.

With belting online you get 3 for the same price. Just saying :slight_smile:
