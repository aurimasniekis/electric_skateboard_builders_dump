Has anyone gotten the superstars on an 8mm axle yet? Seems like with an OD of 28mm there are no bearings that can go down to 8mm ID. @trampa makes spacers to get the bearings up to 9.25mm but not 8mm.  

Any solutions?

I think I'm too wide I think they are too wide  outside to outside of bearings *Siri

You would have to get precision trucks and get a custom axle made at the right length and at 9.25 MM

How about 3d printing or machining some 28x22x8 rings to bridge the gap between a standard 22mm skate bearing and the 28mm bearing seats in the hubs?

We just had the discussion and there are bearings but they will only work with @torqueboards trucks

So if we have the TB wide truck and the 6.5 supa we could use the 638 because the 8mm v 9mm ID shouldn't matter?

ID is 8mm on both - the 638 are 9mm in width though (so will be sticking out a little)

So...TB 218  trucks have a longer exposed axle than standard trucks?

Surfrodz tkp's or rkp's with 10mm axles solves the problem.

@barajabali did you end up with tb trucks and superstar hubs?
Thinking about doing this combination with 6,5 Urban Tires and the new @Hummie deck.

Have someone done this combination of trucks and hubs and has a pic to share?

I used my tb trucks with my airless tires and they worked fine. Im sure that if you found the right bearing so would the trampa

Yea there is also a bearing that fits but sticks out a mm or so. Either way works

Yours is cleaner tho

I think with Board Bumper's kit bearings will be concealed inside. Take a look...
