So I was replacing the connectors in peace than a mosquito came and as i was going to slam him with my hand somehow magically i pulled the positive terminal that's 50cm long from the other side of the table to a super short 5cm negative and wooosh connectors vaporized and my skin with them...
basically all the black skin is detached 
damn it hurts like a mf

Anything would have been better than nothing. I usually have exam gloves just for that purpose. Granted they won't stop a charge. But they will stop direct contact for the most part lol. Yes I've burnt a few times with them on so I know lol.

I usually try to have 2 disconnect points on all my boards.  I have both the anti-spark circuit and I have a hard loop key, which is at the other end of the battery pack, for just this reason.  

First thing I do when I start working on the board is disconnect both.  

Actually these days (after that story from one person here who says his parent's won't let him have his board in the house after he started a fire) I keep the loop key out for storage too.

Also, that sucks, I'm sorry.

Be careful, you may have vaporized the Mosquito's DNA into your finger DNA and recombined them with the electrical charge into a human-mosquito hybrid! If you start seeing bumps appear at the top of your shoulder blades that look like wings, or feel an urge to start drinking blood, get it checked.
