Just had this happen to my single drive, 6374 motor last week.
What thickness is the belt that got shredded?
For me, I ran a single 9mm belt that got over-torqued when going uphill and got shredded.
Upgrading to a 15mm belt now..
Edit: My drivetrain is slightly misaligned so that may have also contributed to the shredding.

you definately did a number on that belt.

k, so i've notice everyone (almost everyone) whose been shredding belts have had a large motor and small belt (9mm).

I think if guys are running these large motors especially on single setups they should consider a belt upgrade to 15mm at minimum.

well iv only 12mm pulleys and 12mm belts are what im using i think but am not sure that its alignment..along with the dodgy motor shaft

your belt is pulling motor towards the wheel pulley.

ya i was having trouble rotating and having pic stay rotated.

take motor mount off and lay it on flat surface

if it is single, the torque always destroy the belt unless u go slow. U will need nice idler or go dual. even with 15mm, belt life is short. it is just inevitable out come. also buy belt from ebay in bulk it is way cheaper and save shipping cost. I always buy 275 270 265 5 of each. wich is about 3dollar per belt from same seller.

I just noticed your belt dosen't have fiber over the little bumps. but mine has. maybe the belt is faulty or bad quality.

As I know how much is to make small sync belt I'm not sure why they listed so expensive on 'merican or eu sites. 

place like aliexpress you can buy 10 for $20.
it just takes time to come over from china

How sharp are the edges of your pulleys? Do they feel sharp or not?
On my first build I shredded one belt a week, it was so frustrating. I recognized that both pulleys have quite sharp edges and when I took a close up picture of the motor pulley compared to a proper one I was shocked. Never had problems with belts on other pulleys so far, my first pulleys were a joke.

The answer is to @stormboard1  but what @rich is showing is a worn pulley. A worn pulley will destroy belts. I found this out too. If you have a small size motor pulley they wear out faster than a larger tooth one. 

After I discovered this I switched to much lower KV motors so I could run a larger motor pulley and smaller wheel pulley to get to the same top speed range. The pulleys last much longer and I have not broke a belt since I changed to that setup. Currently runing 140kv 12s with 18/36 gearing on 97mm wheels.

In case it is a worn pulley, switch to steel. They last allot longer.

True, but I wanted to point out differences in NEW pulleys. Both in the pic are 15T pulleys, the "worn" was used for 2 months only but the surface on each teeth was tiny and sharp from the beginning. You can see the tiny edge instead of a surface compared to the left pulley.


![teeth|690x235](upload://qpS77WieJMNvOzp1iOjAqp9xIXu.jpg)

And as @telnoi mentioned steel pulley for president!

You must need: 

* 15 mm pulley
* 15 teeth and up (less destroys belt)
* Made of Steel
* With two flanges (thin edge)
* No overhang

Extra (but not required):

* 200 kv motor or less
* Idler
```

Don't want to start any argument, but it looks exactly like heavy wear I have seen on low tooth aluminum pulleys. They can wear out in less then a month. 

![image|690x403](upload://2odxDbpUWtyGKudDyFrJ8pmRH6w.jpg)

I'm sure the like new tooth profile is the blue area. 

And a couple of my worn 12 tooths. They had thick teeth when new.

This should be ok. But yeah lets see the photos. 

If there is any way you can run an idler on that motor mount it will help the belt mesh better with the pulley and reduce excess load on the belt. I have seen some people put an idler on one of the motor bolts.

I get my belts [here](https://www.aliexpress.com/store/product/5pcs-5M-synchronous-belt-260-5M-15-teeth-52-Rubber-width-15mm-length-260mm-HTD260-5M/702327_32257523673.html?spm=2114.12010612.0.0.2c0471129qz1Sy), but there standard is 15mm wide. Your setup looks like it might fit a 15? Or ask them to cut some 12mms for you.

Honestly from my perspective it looks like you're using 5M belt on 3M pullies... Where did you get them from

that would definitely cause some issues...

yesterday was helping someone figure out what type of belt they had just purchase from a kit, i assumed it was 5m but after reviewing the link, sure enough was a 3m setup.  Good look/observation @ShutterShock, so to all those buying kits online (elsewhere) be sure to DBL check that info.  [the particular item i was reviewing was stated to be for a scooter, but very similar to esk8 setup]

revisiting this topic, Recently my build happens to have not aligned belt, fairly long 275mm. about 1-2mm off and scrapes side of pulley making some pattern on, making squiky noise
I really risk myself and put it to the test.
I went about 60km in range went 30mph+
So far i don't have any issue, sure it got hot a bit but nothing major. and the belt went through 2 month of use prior to the test. 
I found, to shred like your picture, belt have to be loose a lot. if it was too tight, it will snap off. 
And I also do think the pulley looks 3 not 5 but could be the picture problem
