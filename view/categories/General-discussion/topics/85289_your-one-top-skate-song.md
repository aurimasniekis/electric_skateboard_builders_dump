What the title says. 

If you had one song to skate to for the rest of your life, what would it be?

80's skate music was great, but I want to know... 

I have an idea for mine but I'm going to have to think on it for a bit before I decide for sure.

How about you guys? One post per user please otherwise it defeats the purpose- edit if need be.

Okay, not my number one pick for catchy songs that I like right now and for the past couple years, but a song I come back to consistently... A song that for high speed downhill skateboarding just sets the mood right... 

I need a 4wd 10-20KW geared for 60mph for this:

When going fast usually a recent D&B or simply powerful song will play in my head, but for regular skateboarding, this stands out as an iconic song for me:

@Bobby It all depends on the bluegrass you listen to, I like all kinds of bluegrass personally.  I'm especially fond of a band that's a crossover between blugrass and rap, Gangstagrass.  It's on my riding playlist and I dare you to listen to this song and not want to ride.
