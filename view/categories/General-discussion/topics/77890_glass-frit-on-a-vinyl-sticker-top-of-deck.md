Greetings,

I was wondering if such an option is possible without damaging the vinyl sticker.

I want to put a vinyl sticker on top of the board and bond it well to the wood, then cover the vinyl with epoxy and put some fine glass frit on top of it preserving some transparency, while keeping grip.

Is it possible/viable?

Maybe somebody knows some glass frit sources in Europe?

How should I extra-bond the vinyl to the deck so it's not the weakpoint and it doesn't peel from the wood?
```

I asked about this.  I like sticker bombing stuff.
Was told to put a think clear over the stickers first and let it cure completely.  Then apply epoxy/polyurethane and frit.

Try 3m spray adhesive.  Should do the job.

Interestingly auto suggestions didn't show it. Oh well. I don't want the clear coat to melt the vinyl, but I guess I should just use a normal clear coat I used on my board? Aka aerosol.

And 3M adhesive for sticking the vinyl extra good on the board that is?

Yeah i think the epoxy will damage the ink in the vinyl worse than the clear. 
And yeah spray adhesive should be plenty to bond the vinyl down. 
I'm thinking of doing the same soon. 
If i get to it first i let you know any bumps i run into.

That would be great.

I figure epoxy/polyester would get through the clear though..

I found this. Would "Fine" fit my needs? Powder seems to be completely powderized(who could have guessed by the name??).

I know lhb, sender and briman all use fine to medium frit. Different looks/feel.

I would test some vinyl on some wood first to see the effects. Is there going to be ink on the vinyl because then you have to think if the ink is soluble. I would put the vinyl down then spray it with krylon acrylic spray for a few coats then. Use epoxy or spar urethane.

This is what I use ![image|183x500](upload://pO6SmO8rM3b7CDARGVr7jNOmGEo.jpeg)

Vinyl 651 or higher is good to go.

631 - removable, wall cling
651 -  permanent unless you use a scraper and goo gone and swear words, I use this on my Rueger car sticker 
951 - marine grade vinyl. Used on boats specifically not to sun fade or corrode. Id go with that to be safest.

Stealing from @Skunk's loctite chart here

It comes down to porousness of the sticker really. I wouldn't want epoxy fading out that beauty

Test test test.  Get a scrap of plywood or something and try different stuff.


I feel like just epoxy over the top is fine.  But I would test first.  

Here are some medium frit examples.![20181205_130156|257x500](upload://vafagrryTrjOTUwy60OCcYKEsKa.jpeg) ![20181209_112912|690x335](upload://5FKVQ4GwXAe0p4Lla6WV5fB1qO8.jpeg) ![20181124_132146|243x500](upload://csAqUfddS3AVRgARCnUW3dmaC7x.jpeg) ![20181124_132020|243x500](upload://kcvHS0489uPrvXkHd8Qn01pcWTM.jpeg) ![20181205_125451|243x500](upload://6UMlMOEZxtwVWerJsgsaqN99ivp.jpeg) 

I like the medium much more than fine.  I think it just looks cooler.

But would fine still grip enough? I want it to be less pronounced and not as ruining to my shoes and skin if something like unwanted contact happens. :slight_smile:

The skull one looks sick though.

fine is fine
[/quote]

It might be just fine then. x)

Why you don't prefer it? Harder to apply? Maybe it falls off the epoxy easier?

Fine red frit.  Though it is more orangey

It is the look.  It holds fine, but the chunky glass requires less and I just like it more.

As I am aiming for clear one, maybe it won't be as noticeable as the red one. :slight_smile: Do you have an example of "fine frit" that is clear by any chance?

I don't. Sorry. Yeah, it will be better than the red fine for sure.  That was for a friend, I am not the biggest fan TBH.

I use fine on all of my builds except when I think it would be better with a coarser frit or a customer ask for it.  But I will say this wet out the area you are putting the frit sprinkle it on and then let it dry then after it is dried put a thin coat so it locks the glass in between the 2 layers.

If I lock it in there's not much way it gets out right? Doesn't it affect the grippyness? The only fear about frit I have is that once epoxy is on and glass frit has the "eroded zones" from wear and tear, it ain't coming off without some belt sander level stuff going at the board. :smiley:

you do a thin layer brushed on.  I have had a board with glass frit on it for 2 years and it was a push board so it my foot is constantly going off and coming back on and I have not felt any difference.  If you see a section that is worn down just brush the area with a thin coat of spar and sprinkle some net glass on it and your done. I have done about 20 boards all with glass frit for myself or for customers and never had an issue.

Hi! Did you tried the galas frit? I was also pallning to do it, but not sure about the gripness you get compare to normal grip tape. Where did you sokruce your glass frit? From the ebay link? I am in Europe too. If you also found a good epoxy or polyurethane solution let me know. I found local polyurethane products thst could work just fine, but sure about it. Thanks a lot!

Just found this source 
https://www.zandstormshop.com/producten/glasfusing/frit-en-confetti/frit-coe-96/
Looks fairly cheap...

I bought my frit from the E-Bay link. Then I bought "leveling epoxy" which self levels on the surface. I still need to cut some corners on my board and get the vinyl made, so it's on hold. I will update once it's going.

Well, I bought it locally, I don't know the brand as it gets sold by quantity.. Bought 1.5kg of it, should be enough for everything.

I guess you could find it somewhere locally too, just look for a "runny" kind of epoxy that's not viscous, art supply stores or places that specialize in epoxy for tables/floors.

Man! Your art works are amazing!. Since you are an expert in that. How do you feel the grip compare to normal grip tape? Do you use epoxy or polyurethane to hold the glass frit in place? Thx

I use epoxy.  I feel like it locks the frit in better. 

I prefer it over normal grip tape

Thanks,  would you described the grip really solid? I would need to try, since in my mind I see it more slippery than grip tape but probably it's just my immagination

So I guess the basic procedure is clean the board, then layer of epoxy, when it's still wet apply grass frit (medium or fine, or a mix), then wait it to cure. Then top coating with a thin layer of epoxy. Is it right?
```

Yup pretty much.

If using fine frit let the epoxy tac up a bit or it will just sink to the bottom and not give you good grip

ah right good that you mentioned it. SO maybe super thin layer first, then wait a bit, second thin layer, grass frit so It can not sink anymore, then wait and top coating. I know I am gonna scratch myself the first time I will try to ride it :rofl:

Grab some small 1/4" pieces of ply (like 4x4" )  and test some different techniques to figure out what you like
