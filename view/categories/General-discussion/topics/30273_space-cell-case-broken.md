I was out riding today, and the plastic shell of my spacecell pro4 cracked, luckily I brought my ductape with me, and was able to ride it home. I was wondering if any of had a cad file for the shell, as I have access to a 3d printer and a plastic forming machine, I think I may be able to make a new shell. Any help is appreciated.<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/7/c/7c3a48dd8de1f9b5f14de35ca56865fb4b72739e.jpg" width="374" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/0/c/0cb08ce7fccb9e1404cf28f82307272af62bdc2e.jpg" width="374" height="500">

be careful pulling out the cells as they are glued to the shell.

Mine had stress cracks after two months of light use and I could tell it wasn't going to last much longer. I had barajabali make a OG spacecell for the raptor 1 with the cells, he said had to heat shrink majority of the individual cells because they were glued to the case

Yeah, mine are siliconed (Is that a word?) in. I'm just going to leave it taped up for now, but I'd love to replace the casing asap.

What size are these cases?
I've made some moulds for fibreglass enclosures.
I'm based in the UK though.

Put some impact-absorbed foam around space cell could let it last way longer. Also my deck got a huge concave so foam would rise the edge up then stuff in it wouldn't get too much stress. 

Always hand-tighten those right bolts, don't push them too hard. Mine still perfect after a year's abuse.

Holyshit, they really didn't want these cells to come out.

an abs acetone slurry should rejoin the cracked off piece to the enclosure.

While shimmying the battery out, I accidentally made contact between some cells, and now it works. Do I fully understand what happened? No. But it works, I'll go for a ride and see what happens. If anyone is willing to take my pack and repair it correctly, I'll pay. (I think the silicon was pulling on a cell, and now that pressure is released)

Happened to mine too @MrHappy I just bought some small straps and used some copper pipe insulation around the edges. Nothing on it has broken since.

This happened to my SP4 case too. Whole thing ended up getting scrapped and replaced with one made by @barajabali and put into my old case.

Then the same thing happened to my current case. Did what @Jinra mentioned and it still works. It also allowed me to replace the missing corner that broke off.

Another useful tip in additional to using washers is what @mmaner mentioned, which was to use a heat gun to soften the ABS and press the corners down to help it conform to the curvature of the deck.

Plastic weld it back on. It's really easy with a flat blade 40w soldering iron and some cable ties for donor plastic...

I remember trying that. Didn't last a minute. It probably wasn't the best weld, but I was never confident in plastic weld for this application. ABS slurry is basically chemical welding. Works better than iron welding and is easier in my opinion.

You need to reinforce it with small wire rods. It's how I made my whole enclosure...

In other products this would be grounds for a recall ! =)  Damn these road vibrations really eff things up

I removed my pack from my board just as it was smoking, and it exploded. luckily i put it under a metal barrel, and have the appropriate equipment for a lithium cleanup. Im a little shaken, but if anyone is selling battery packs, you know who to contact. c:

I have the enertion enclosure not the whole pack just shell.
One broke on me same as pictured,now all I do is torque down from the top of the board and have a nut underneath and add a bit of 277 loctite so no need to over tighten.
Mine never came with mounting hardware so just bought nutserts/rivnuts, nuts and bolts.
The bolt mounted from the bottom puts too much stress on the enclosure.<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/1/e/1e9d63ba3066742225aacd234c6c9d260e65cf97.jpg" width="281" height="500">

I'll get some for you, my board is currently pulled apart as the motor wires were bridging again and I had finished building my eMTB so hadn't bothered trying to use it again.
