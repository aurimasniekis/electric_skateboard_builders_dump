I made it using an old bike rack. I just added 2 hooks for helmets and an extra shelf so I can hold 2 electric boards and hang my 2 non-electric boards plus my Ripstik (which I will be electrifying soon!).  I also zip tied an old LED cord to it that I had laying around.

Take it you have an old leiftech for this wizardry?  Can't wait to see the result of that.  I love my ripsurf.  Same same but different.

Yeah. I have never ridden a ripsurf but I assume the torsion bar on the ripstik is superior the flexible plastic in the middle of the ripsurf.

Its tighter is all.  Holds more like a solid deck.  Great workout though.
