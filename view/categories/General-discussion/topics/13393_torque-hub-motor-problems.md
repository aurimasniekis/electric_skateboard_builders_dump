Had anyone had any problems with torque hub motors urethane separating from the Motor? I just finished my first build and was out on a test ride and took a corner at speed and the bolts holding the urethane ripped through and then crushed the bolt section of the motor

Hi @oatmealman,

You can send us an email. We can send you a retainer. The retainer holds your wheel in much better.

It comes standard with all of our hub motors now.
