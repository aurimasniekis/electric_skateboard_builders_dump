All the latest talk of legalities, trademarks etc got me to thinking.
What is the legal standpoint on abec 11 wheel clones?
As useful as it is for us and our drive systems, is there a legal problem with just blatantly copying the abec wheel and or spoke pattern and marketing it as your own?
Could this potentially land you in a sticky situation? Or am I missing the point?

I think it depends if they have a design patent.  If they do, then they could likely sue the sellers of clone wheels. Since legit ABEC wheels are of higher quality they may cater to a different crowds somewhat so they may not be concerned with this.

As a consumer I doubt there is any risk.
