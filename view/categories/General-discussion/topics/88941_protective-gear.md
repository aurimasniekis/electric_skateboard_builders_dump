Hello Guys,

I hope you are all well, and i am happy to be on this forum.

I have purchased a Raptor 2, it is a beast of a board.

However i would like to know what other protective gear is needed other than my full face helmet.

I am not a professional in Esk8's or anything so maybe more protection would be better. I live in Australia, anywhere good i can purchase them?

Any tips?

Thanks

Gloves and knee pads are always good. Upper body protection like a armored hoodie or elbow pads are nice

I wear downhill style slide gloves with velcro pucks.
Closest thing i can wear to a wrist guard and still hold my remote. 

You can take a cutting board and cut pieces to fit around your remote and attach to gloves with velcro if the pucks that come with the gloves are too big.

Those gloves look nice mate, you say a wrist guard impedes you holding the remote? I have a nano x which is very small.

I have broken my wrist before so i may wear one as it takes a long time to heal!

Yeah I've broken my wrist a few times and even shattered my hand.... trust me i know. 
I wear a wrist guard on my off hand. But myself and lots of other members find it difficult to hold the remote firmly with one on your remote hand. 
I tried at first and almost dropped my remote at full speed mid ride......

Lots of old threads on this topic, I ended up copying some of @Deckoz's suggestions [here](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/what-protective-gear-do-you-use-excluding-the-helmet/48261/2).

- Sector 9 lightning gloves which are [on sale right now](https://www.sector9.com/products/lightning-glove-black): these are real nice, quality leather, look slick. Rotating the right hand puck makes enough room for the remote and seems to still let you slide. (Haven't launched myself yet though, will write back.)
- TSG DHPs: super nice knee pads, pretty quick to put on / take off (no need to remove shoes).

I wear wrist guards (snowboarding ones apparently). Yes they do make holding a remote difficult-ish (I have a "mini" remote) but I'm a software developer and I can't afford to break too many wrists.

Can't imagine what it would be like to be a carpenter or someone who needs to use tools for a job and have a broken wrist.

I'm tempted to try and design a remote that could be used with wrist guards.

I just got my Raptor 2.1 and after riding it for 10min i feel like i need more protection lol.

When i rode my meepo i just used my Full Face MTB Helmet. For the Raptor i bought Flatland 3D Gloves but i think i need also ellbow and knee pads.

For slow riding, if you fall you just roll 1or 2 times, you can get by soft foam protection like gform. For fast riding, if you fall you don't want to roll, you want to slide to dissipate the force. So you need hard plastic on the outside and soft foam on inside. G form becomes not so good.

I personally went for TSG Force V A, I prefer the bulk for better protection.

Man, the range on this thing is crazy, i was on R-Spec mode, the whole time and went about 30Km and still had 35% battery life when i got home.

I have to buy elbow and knee pads also, never underestimate the power of the Raptor, even when you think your going fast and give the throttle it can kick you back and fall down...

Do you have 2.0 or 2.1?

The original 2.0, i bought it used from someone. I hope they stock the wheels back in their store, i need some new ones soon.

Your one is nice because you have the Unity box, much easier to configure. I would look into making the brakes stronger from the App because if you are going fast you need the extra braking power.

Also, do not ride in the wet, your board will get drenched even from small puddles. What i did was put silicone all around the enclosure, so i can even ride in the rain now.

Thanks for the tips.
Yes, I bought a 2 week old Raptor 2.1 yesterday. I was only able to cruise it for 15min but my battery dropped from 95% to 85% in less than 2km. 
I'm worried but I'm going to do a full range test today.

For example, the guy has only 11.4miles in slowmode.

Concerning wet roads I have heard the problem and will avoid it.

but man the torque the torque :smiley:

There has to be something wrong with his battery for sure.

I can do 11 miles and still have over 50% left in R-Spec mode (although i am not full throttling every second).

Yea the torque is the best thing about it, i am still having trouble turning properly though as the board is stiff, and if i loosen the trucks i get speed wobbles but if i tighten i cannot turn that much.

I have to use kicktail for tighter turns..

That's what I thought.

I'll be testing my raptor extensively in a few hours. I also noticed the big turning circle but I also expected that. I'll see how to deal with the kicktail in tight streets. :)

I personally use a TSG Pass helmet (a thing of beauty, and made for the mad downhill crew), leather gloves (because they are quite resistant and malleable, allowing you to hold the remote safely) and g-form body protection (really thin, but really effective... you don't need to look like an American Football player to be safe). 

All of the above have saved my skin (literally!) in a few past occasions. Hope this helps! Enjoy your rides!

Thanks mate, do you have any links to Gform body protection?

Also did you buy the TSG Pass from here on the group buy? I was wondering if it will happen again... would love to get that looks sick!

They're having a sale right now:

https://g-form.com/sale

I have Elite knee and elbow, and a compression shirt.   They're nice for keeping from getting scraped up and provide a little impact protection, but they're not even close to hard pads.  Knee drop test hurts a bit but no damage.

You might look into motocross/motorcycle protective gear.  That's stuff is designed for high speed crashes, where the gform stuff is more for impacts at human-powered speeds.  The gform pads aren't going to provide much protection at 35mph.  This kind of gear will:

https://www.revzilla.com/armored-motorcycle-jackets-vests

I have one of the Fly Racing Dirt Barricade armored tops I'm selling if you're interested.

https://www.revzilla.com/motorcycle/fly-racing-barricade-body-armor-suit

Pretty good short-sleeve, with great spine armor, but I've got long sleeve armor that I always use so I've only tried it on a couple of times, never worn it to ride.  It's a med, PM me if you're interested and I can give you more details.  

Whatever you choose, Do wear protection.  You are absolutely doing the right thing asking about it. There are tons of threads on this forum about guys crashing and getting hurt, even at slow speeds, even wearing some gear.  A few people have even lost their lives.  So gear up.....

Cheers!

Hi, 

I got the g-forms and TSG helmet from Amazon - some times they have good promotions, keep an eye on them!
