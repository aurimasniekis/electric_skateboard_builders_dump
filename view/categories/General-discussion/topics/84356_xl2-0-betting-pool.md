The rules are simple 
Just bet on a date when you think this will happen and who ever is closer to the actual date that it  happen get a free XL DECK

1. If 2 people bets are the same, the first earlier post will be the one to claim the price. 
2. All bets from the previous thread are valid. 
3. One bet per person.

Never, I think Frank/Trampa are too stuck up to realize that your design is great. He hates that he has a deck that "supposedly" looks a bit like yours. He's going to just market a very similar TRAMPA COPYRIGHT X 1,000,000 deck. 

How do I collect that board at the end of eternity?

If I have to say a date to win I'll go with June 28th 2019.

I'm going with the 29th september 2019.  Actually if frank is reading this which he most definitely is,
I'm betting he will announce a release date, wait for you to acknowledge a winner then change the date as an update and wait till you acknowledge a winner then change the date as an update......
Then release plans for the exact same deck dated way before your first design and try to sue your ass.
Kind of how he rolls.

Nice try to turn things around. Actually the KALY deck is copy of our HP line with added concave side rails
that @Koringer introduced. There are plenty of decks with concave available since the 70ths. It's no rocket science and not " I invented concave lips, lets see when I get copied" by the company that I copied in the first place. 

@Chrisjarram thx for lifting the smokescreen up a bit.
@Koringer might also want to join in and bet on 2nd October 2018. 
He made his concave lip design available on Thingiverse last autumn.  
I can see some similarities.....
@Koringer should run this thread but I guess it would be far below his dignity.

This is turning into the stupid iPhone vs Samsung...oh no you are releasing a phone that is a rectangle and has a screen, ahhhh you copied us!!!!

The amount of mental gymnastics here is what is below most people's dignity. 

3D printed mods =! a new deck that encompasses new geometry as a solid piece.

Modern design is all iterative. See Scrub channel trucks. *wink wink*

It's like people building sand castles and whining about other people copying their sand castle designs. 

None of this will matter in 5 years. The design details are secondary to availability and customer relationship. The latter is probably what you guys should focus on, given how much damage Frank has done to Trampa's reputation. This doesn't help your cause at all. 

Be better, be bigger than this shit. The classy move would've been to join in on the tongue-in-cheek fun and post a date, not get your panties in a bunch and get defensive. It makes you look petty and like you're just whining that competition exists.

How about you embrace it and keep innovating? Make something better than this. We welcome the innovation.

Signed, a long term customer who is pretty annoyed at this constant sore loser attitude from a company that should be better than this.

Wait, so I can't design anything using user-intuitive that has been influenced by prior design? 

There goes 99% of our products and consumables. That would be throwing away years and years of design and innovation to he petty. 

All of my human factors engineering degree cringes at this thread and is the nail in the coffin for @trampa for me. I don't like to base my purchases off of one person's actions, especially when I generally like the product said company represents. However, frank, the way you conduct yourself in this thread, in order threads, hell... In EVERY thread that you jump into, is that of a distraught child mixed with Trump.

The best part is, this is in no way, shape, or form is vendor bashing. It's solely you and your antics bashing. It felt great emptying my cart on your website after reading you disgrace yourself again.

@trampa
Don‚Äôt flatter yourself, the only feature is the  outline that resemble yours, besides that this is a whole new product different from yours. You praise your construction process and have stated that is where the magic is, so is the same here. 

Let‚Äôs not go back and forward with this pettiness. 
I greatly admire the work you put on your products, I‚Äôve had said so countless times, let‚Äôs have some fun and not make a mess. 

P.S. 
please put your bet in, to make it more FUN :slight_smile:

Hello guys,

As far as I'm concerned, I just created what I wanted, and everyone is free to use it. I didn't invented anything. I would have never built this board without inspiration from Kaly. He's a craftman and Trampa is a board company, I don't understand what is the problem if you inspire each other or why being the first should be more rewarded. Knowledge and ideas should be open source.

Words of wisdom here. Much respect man. I wish more people in this world were like you. 

@trampa you literally tagged him, likely expecting him to have the same reaction you did, as you spoke on his behalf even. This is a learning opportunity.

I literally could not agree with you more if I tried. 

I'm of the philosophy that ideas are cheap, it's the execution of those ideas that holds value. 

Those that aren't confident in their execution are usually the ones worried about gatekeeping 'their' ideas.
