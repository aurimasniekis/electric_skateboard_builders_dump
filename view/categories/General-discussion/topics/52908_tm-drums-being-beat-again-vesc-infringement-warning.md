It's commonly referred to as profit mongering. He bumps his price as high as possible the. Uses fear tactics to make other vendors make superfulouse changes thereby increasing their cost and selling price.  

This makes his profit margin greater than another vendors and closes the gap between his product and other products with the injective of raising the sell price industry wide. 

It's underhanded and unethical...which is Frank's most predominant personality traits.

um... dude just don't use vesc (tm) to sell a product unless you acknowledge the trademark & it is not yours. That is about as complicated as it is. If you need help talk to Arch at LaCroix, try him on pm. He has been more than generous with his time and advice. Not that I want to burn that out by putting him in it, but he is solid.

Yea. I know. I sell those and not his. And honestly don’t want anything to do with Trampa.  I would understand if it was Benjamin V emailing me because he was concerned. But it’s frank Trampa. And his motives aren’t to protect Benjamin’s trade mark, it’s to protect his profits. And out of all I’ve seen on the forum Any opposition to any project in competition with franks vesc 6 he attacks and threatens with legal action. EScape. Your box is shaped like my box. 
I would back the little guys if the cost weren’t so high. We are small, not developing anything in that area right now. Really focusing on making things more accessible. I sell a dozen esc every few weeks. I’m not a threat.

And I would say if everyone used it in a manor that displeased a wanker, so be it.

When I first started building my board / first started doing research, I found out I needed a vesc. Upon doing a bit more looking, it seemed to me the only *real* vesc out there was the $300+ vesc 6 sold by trampa. The extensive information / marketing threw me off as a newbie... and I wasn't prepared to pay almost $700 for just the speed controllers. So I asked in the discord and was recommended to use the focbox. That's when I realized and started digging some more to find out that vesc is an open source hardware design, and that $300+ for a vesc wasn't my only option. 

I think there are a small number of people (very small) who might not do as much digging as me who might end up buying vesc 6 from trampa if all the marketing / specs / etc on the page dont overwhelm them as a newbie. I think most people will keep digging a bit for something appearing more simple to use, like the focbox, even if it's essentially the same thing: a vesc.

And now I know, even if I wanted a hardware v6 ESC, there are other cheaper options there too. Thanks forums.

I just hope the seller of alternatives don’t stop to put VESC in the info/threads so it’s possible to find them when searching. This is trampas main goal and I hope as many as possible mess that up. It’s fucked up that he comes in to skim the profit of a open source project like vesc that was developed and tested by the community.

[/quote]

The VESC aka Vedder ESC has been developed by Benjamin Vedder alone, not the community. 99.5% of the work is in the code, which is Open Source thx to Benjamins ethos to code sharing. 

Without the tremendous amount of effort he put into the coding, no ESC that is based on his work would spin a motor a quarter turn. It is his baby and he can do with it what ever he likes. It's probably fair enough that he owns the rights to the name of the project. That doesn't hinder anyone to make and sell VESC-Based hardware in any future. 

On top of that the TM policies are pretty fair, based on the Linux TM policies. Most OS-Projects own the TM for the Project name, and a lot of them derive profits from service or hardware sales. That is not skimming, it is essential for project survival. No cash, no future.

But the reason it’s a success is because of the community. After all , something’s not a success if not for people actilvly using it no? Nor should you disregard the software made my folks like @Ackmaniac that contributes to people choosing the VESC. 

It’s obvious that the honest reason you guys are so persistent about this is because you want the mere mention/recommendation of VESC to lead to the buy of your overpriced VESC , and I wouldn’t  be surprised if you guys were to then push the narrative to group all other ESC that aren't named VESC together , even if derived from the VESC, as Chinese copies/lesser.

No one denies what he has done or doing. And so far no one has quoted some large monitory loss because someone advertised a product based off his work using a acronym that basically says he did it. Doesn’t the V stand for Vedder? 
I’m sure he doesn’t throw open the books on his donations for all to see. I know people donate. I have a filling he is doing ok in cash department as well as trampa. So to cry money. Really is like crying wolf.
And simply because I didn’t word or arrang the description correctly and using VESC®. 
At least that’s what I’m getting from terms of use on Vedder site. 
Look out the knife  is in the left hand. FESC, sound like a flea dip

Partly true, but people are using it because the software is better than anything else out there. The success is based on dam hard work, done in thousands of hours after work by a guy in Sweden. Without that effort most e-boards would not perform half as good as they do today, due to lack of alternatives in OS- software code which is OS till today. 

OS means you can use and remix the code, not necessarily the project identity. It is about sharing the code and technology, allowing individuals and companies to use and modify the code. The VESC-Project is not a mass movement from coders who share the project development among them, using a shared project identity. If VESC would be non protected, everyone could clone Benjamins code and publish it, using the same naming. That would get well confusing for anyone wanting to download the software in future. Which is the original then? Which is the one Benjamin Vedder is behind? Which VESC domain would be the original source, linking into Benjamins server? 
How the hell on earth would you want to control misuse of project identity in future without having the rights to the name? Why do the majority of OS-Projects have Trademarked their brand? Because it is necessary to avoid confusion. That is the purpose of a TM, nothing else. In consequence you will find trademark policies on any major OS-Project website. And they all have a mail address allowing to report TM-violations. So does the VESC-Project. It is common practice in the OS-World and the entire industry. If all of the projects do that, why should the privately run VESC-Project not be allowed to do the same? 

For the ones wanting some statistics, fresh from the system:

Donations in April: 165€ 
100% of that from individuals, derived from 10 individual software orders in total. 
Total new downloads in April: 345
(This excludes software updates from previous orders)

Donations from ESC manufacturers, vendors etc: 0€

If you think hardware prices should purely consider manufacturing cost + a little profit, you forget development costs, which Benjamin shouldered all alone in the past. We are talking thousands of hours of unpaid work that allowed manufacturers to make and sell hardware and allowed users to ride their boards with a nice controller. If you ask Benjamin what he thinks a VESC should cost, you will be glad about our pricing.

Makes sense. In your opinion, what would be the best way for manufacturers of ESCs based off VESC to indicate that to customers? As a consumer, I know I don't just want any old ESC, but something based on the VESC. 

Something along the lines of "Based off of the VESC" or "Hardware and software deprived from the VESC"? 

Thanks for your thoughts.

I can't really comment on the technicalities of developing the VESC, the software, etc.. as that's not my area of expertise, but I really don't see how this is constantly an issue being argued over.  Nobody is denying that BV dedicated a significant amount of time and probably money in the creation of this product.  HOWEVER, he gave up his right to monetary compensation for this the moment he made it Open Sourced.  Bill Gates didn't create a bunch of software, make it open source, and then make a ton of money off of it did he?  That's the whole point of open sourced IP.  Regardless of how little people decide to contribute to him, raising all these side issues after the fact, and pretending like your main purpose in these matters is altruism... It doesn't matter.  That's a cold hard fact.  If BV needed to make some money from this he simply could have just NOT made it open sourced. End of discussion.

Too be clear, I'm NOT saying that TM copyrights shouldn't be followed or enforced, but making these arguments and sending out letters too other manufacturers as if this is the real issue is so transparently not the real reason.  Saying it's about protecting consumers from 'being confused' is so off the mark it's laughable.

People need to start reading the TM policies with some care. They aim to strike a fair balance. 
Of course interests vary. Manufacturers have certain interests, the software developer has certain interests, consumer have certain interest. 

It is nor always easy to match those interests since they can partly collide. 

This is a quote from the policies: 

_Mr. Vedder Trademark Usage Guidelines_
_Trademarks are used to provide assurance to the community of consistency with respect to the quality of products or services with which the mark is associated. This policy attempts to strike the proper balance between two competing interests:_
_the need of Mr. Vedder to ensure that his trademarks remain reliable indicators of the qualities that they have been created to preserve and_
_the need of Mr. Vedder to ensure that community members are able to discuss the projects with which Mr. Vedder is associated and to accurately describe the relationship between Mr. Vedder and the products and services offered by others._

It is not the aim to cut everyone of from using the project name. The aim is to strike a balance that works for everyone. Users want to be able to identify the original source while the source wants to be clearly identifiable in any future. Projects grow organically and want to stay clearly identifiable in any future. So the only way forward is to get the TM and balance things out, setting up policies. This is what happened. 

Making and selling  hardware I would advise to give the product a unique identifier, offsetting it from the competition while describing it a based on, or compatible with. Like a computer, tablet or smartphone, showing it runs or can run Android, Linux, windows etc. Customers then know what to expect.
You would need to put some effort into marketing, showing USPs and build up your reputation from there. That is common practice, selling hardware and in your very own interest anyway. Without brand / product awareness you can't offset your products in the market. 

In future we will hopefully see more different designs. They can't all be called the same. Customers want to be able to differentiate product a from product b, especially if quality varies a lot.

I think the point here is that people DON'T want a difference from product A to product B when it comes to the VESC precisely because it is a VESC and many only know that's considered the best ESC.  When we can't even be sure of whether one is based off the VESC project or not because of these silly naming issues, that is what becomes a problem FOR THE CONSUMER.

Edit:

Yes, I realize the TM issue is not 'silly'...  That's not the point here though...

You can search TMs online. 

TMview for example: type VESC into search.

Registered in EU, USA, AU, Russia.
Filed in HK, China, Israel, Switzerland, Korea.

Benjamin put a statement up his Forum in 2017.
In addition to that he uploaded TM policies on the VESC-Project.com Website (bottom of page).

Do you honestly think someone puts that much effort into Trademarking, if he doesn't find it necessary?

Sweet. Thanks. I don’t think the existence of it was in question or the stipulations. We understand what it is what it’s supposed to do. In this case is his quality being treaded on by a copy cat less than standard. No, I sell the FOCBOX and Maytech super esc. Nothing else. Not misleading and simply because (vesc) was in descriptions on 4 products and a category this lovely discussion. All I’m sure where infringements. To what degree, in court that intent was to mislead. No. Just a mistake. FOCBOX , and Maytech will bring all the people I need to help build a community in central Texas that’s well informed, given the best possible price and service that is based lmore on giving than selling. 
To me the bottom line is doing the best for the customer and that means not always turning a buck on every move. 
We are small but have ideals that will bring people around. Not because they are forced to ( witch is what has been the norm in the past ) because they want to!  In the end once we are done convenience, quality, affordability and choices with out all the overhead, markup and additional cost of overcharged shipping and long delivery times will make what we are doing more appealing then 12 orders and 1-3 months wait time for parts to do a build. 

In the end the question is, is frank protecting trade mark from someone selling inferior products or misleading customers in to thinking it the VESC6. No 

In the end he is just give the little guys shit, just like the big guys do. And it quit all right.

Donations from ESC manufacturers, vendors etc: 0€

Just out of curiosity can Benjamin write an invoice? A company can't just give money for nothing to someone right?

[quote="trampa, post:26, topic:52908"]
Without that effort most e-boards would not perform half as good as they do today, due to lack of alternatives in OS- software code which is OS till today.

True but on the other hand we might got something like dual Focbox earlier if VESC was not around.

FOCBOX is a VESC 4.xx based ESC :thinking:

Yep but this new dual one. Someone (@Blasto maybe)  said that it's not VESC.

Some hardware upgraded, still uses VESC code/software, Jason changed the name from VESC-X to FOCBOX...

About the VESC trademark
Postby benjamin » 17 May 2017, 16:17

It seems like several people are upset because I have obtained a trademark on the name VESC, so I would like to clarify a few things about that. For now this long post can be used as a reference if people are asking about the trademark.

At first I had no idea about trademarks and did not care about them either. Frank (from trampaboards) told me that it is very important to have a trademark and that I should get one if I want to take VESC project further. An international trademark is very expensive and I had no way to pay for it, so trampa offered me to pay for it hoping that the VESC6 production that we planned to do together would cover at least that cost.

To make the deal with trampa clear:

1. The trademark is registered in my name alone, and I let them use it when selling the VESC6. I have made the design, checked the production carefully and share the profits of the sales with them from the VESC6, so the VESC6 hardware sold by trampa has a strong connection to my name. I want to point out that I have no obligation to stay with trampa for the "official" VESC hardware in the future as the trademark is in my name, so this is really a choice that I make myself.

2. Trampa has the responsibility for the sold hardware. I would not sell hardware myself as I am afraid to get into trouble when doing that, so for me and the community this is a much better option than not having any hardware available at all where I have been involved in the production and quality checks to this extent.

3. Considering the costs for the trademark, legal stuff, testing, traveling, compliance testing etc, the VESC6 hardware is not likely to generate any profit any time soon. No one is even getting paid for the hours spent on this. For trampa the gain is that they will have a very good motor controller that they can sell with their boards for the best user experience, and for me this is a step in the direction of making a solid foundation for the VESC project.

Going back to the trademark, there are many good reasons to have a trademark and all major open source projects have one. For one thing, there are many countries where a trademark is first come, first serve and if a project gains critical mass there are people who will get a trademark and try to take advantage of that. Here is an example where that happens:

https://retropie.org.uk/2017/02/legal-help-needed/

Further, only one person or company can have a trademark, and for the VESC I think it is most appropriate that I have the trademark since I have literally spent years on the software development for the VESC. It is also kind of funny that many people see the VESC as the hardware that is around that many people have tweaked and made in the community; that is not where the value of the VESC project is. The great majority of the work is in the software. I can make a new PCB in a few days, and the software has taken me years to write. The hardware is only a tiny fraction of the work.

The trademark policies, which can be found here

http://www.vesc-project.com/trademark_policies_page

are very much based on the linux trademark policies, which is shared under a CC license. Other open source projects that have trademarks are raspberry pi, arduino, gnome, mozilla, joomla, drupal and many more. Joomla for example has some trademark FAQs that probably apply to most open source projects and their trademarks:

https://tm.joomla.org/trademark-faq.html

In general the trademark does not exclude the community from getting involved with the VESC Project and making/selling hardware, it is intended for making it possible to identify things that are called VESC with myself. Right now there are many websites out there that look like the official VESC website, and people who find them often think that they are from me. For example, many people have asked my about "my" site vesc.co.uk and products they bought there when in fact I have nothing to do with that site or their products. If you open that site and several others it is not easy to tell that they are not published by me, and that is a problem in general which a trademark is supposed to protect against.

Fair use of the trademark essentially is that you can base your design/product on all the open source software and hardware that I have published (following the license terms as usual), but you have to sell it under your own name and give attribution to the project. For example "XSC, based on the open source VESC(R) project". There are some examples of what is fair use and what is not if you read my trademark policies.

I think there is nothing wrong with me not wanting to be associated with things that I don't even know about or have anything to do with, and that is what a trademark is for.

I also want to mention the partner program briefly that I'm working on. People have gotten crazy ideas that I want to use the trademark to claim money from them for all the VESC4 that they have sold until now, and that is certainly not the case. Anyone can use the things I have published just as before and sell it under their own name; and they don't have to pay me anything. All they have to do, just as before, is complying with the GPL license for the software, meaning among other thing that if they change the software they have to publish the changes as well. The idea with the partner program is to have manufacturers for example pay a small amount per unit they sell in exchange for having them listed as compatible hardware under the VESC-project website and for me maintaining support for their hardware in VESC Tool and the VESC firmware for future updates of the software. But again, no one is forced to do that and they can just do their own thing with the VESC open source stuff using their own name and not pay me anything. I hope however that enough manufacturers will see some value in supporting the project so that maybe eventually the income will be enough to pay for a salary or two. Then development of e.g. open source apps can be accelerated by paying developers. This is not my only plan for trying to get a bit of funds from the project while keeping it open source and involving more manufacturers, but I will not write more details about that here. I'm working on the VESC Project website and trying to set everything up and explain things there. [...]

It really sucks when established companies want to keep the smaller ones from growing, it shows that big companies forget how they started and came from. im pretty sure they were very small at one time when starting.

If you read between all the repetitive gibberish coming from @trampa this is really what it’s about. Escape and this focbox seller clearly didn’t want to pass off like vesc6 with just mentioning the name but trampa is going all in to stop them so he can sell more vesc6. This is ONLY about money nothing else..

@Acidfie Thanks for the **relevant info**!

Guys how about starting to use as a listing model reference : 

"[YOUR_ESC_NAME] based on VESC™ project from Benjamin Vedder, compatible with VESC™ project **open source software**"

Simple. 

@Trampa How about this. Can we cut the bullshit and get back to improving the controllers. 

I'm pretty confident you play a big part in "Zero ESC manufacturers have donated to Ben" due to your aggressive marketing strategy. And I'd like to trust your numbers but I can't, sorry. 

It just won't happen without backup. 

You're doing so much to offer quality products for mountain boards. You have your unique spot in this category, which no one tries to claim. You don't need to go at war with VESC  type ESCs to expand your market. You don't.

 And people won't stop once they're involved either, you're wasting time sending nonsense to who you deem compétition while you could manage your sales and further development instead!

I personally don't think the TM will have any impacts on hardware sales for no one. The TM doesn't serve the purpose to hinder anyone from making and selling their hardware designs. It is explicitly allowed to describe your device as based or compatible with, so that customers can easily see that the device will be able to run the firmware.

Companies who are serious about what they sell give their products a unique identifier/naming anyway, so that their products can be easily separated from competing products. In the end your offered quality and service + marketing will make the difference in sales, not the use of a certain TM.

It is in your very own interest to build up your own reputation and branding. Everyone using the same name for the different products/qualities will only confuse. 
We will see more different designs soon, so they should be named differently, associated with the different brands out there. 

As said before: It is all about finding a good balance that works for the project, the manufacturers and the customers. And the TM in combination with the TM policies strikes quite a good balance. 
This is why most OS-Projects go down that exact line. There is a reason for that. 

The code is a given horse after all. People need to start to accept that things are as they are and rather be thankful for what they get, rather then complaining about what they didn't get. 
The brand is not part of the OS-License. The code is licensed. It is not about making code and technology + branding available for everyone to instantly being able to start cloning an existing product with an existing branding. 

It is about sharing code and ideas to enable others to build something (else) upon that.

@Vanarian : I get emails from customers telling me about TM violations. Whenever something pops up, I do inform the companies that there is an issue, since this is a legal duty. If it pops up, you need to inform the violator of a TM about the issue. 
You can't close your eyes... 
In future this will be handled by the legal advisors, as part of a TM monitoring contract.  Benjamin and I can't browse the web all day long and have conversations with to many people. 

I agree: Wasting time on such debates is not our interest, nor should it be anyone elses. 
If that time would be put into innovating things it would be far more better invested. 

We didn't start crying like a baby in the public about a matter that has been debated already down to the derail, nor did we call anyone Asholes, Wankas etc.

Yes, make your product  Unik to stand apart. True if you manufacture, not resale. Also I think if your interest in the project wasn’t monetary in nature and you where doing it on your overwhelming need to protect the project it would be easier to swallow. 

Once again no one has said it’s not his work or it didn’t take forever and it’s great code. Ok. He has been praised and to protect the project he TM it with your money. Is there biase. Yes. Understandably. 

We are not in a market that has leveled off or slowed down. We are in a growing industry and you just happen to be established. Great. No one want to take that. But when you target anyone who happens to have v before a esc and read them the right act and how much trouble we could get in and fake nice way. Bullshit. I’m from Texas. I know what bull shit is. 
It’s a tactic a shitty one used by established companies like yours to control the smaller guys coming up. 
We all have our vision of what could be. I can see a large migration away for this project because of the issues arising from it. 
Companies like evolve and boosted have made changes to the degree they don’t have to fallow your drum. It’s only a matter of time before one is developed for the community by the community and not just one guy who found himself talked into a deal with you. 
As far as I’m concerned it’s a non issue with me. There are enough guys out here in the community just on the forum who have started to take some this and place it where it belongs in the hands of the end user. 
Your message is well received frank. 
I’m just defiant by nature, Benjamin L
