Currently you pull around 30a at let's say 42v. 1200w roughly.

You dont need 1200w constantly.... I mean the A when you reached your speed

Depends on the way you drive. But in average it will be around 300 watts for a cruise ride with a street setup. But that can differ a lot if you accelerate and brake the entire time or go only fullspeed. But for acceleration to riding speed you need much more watts.

Also take a look at other threads, just use the search bar. I think two people messed around with solarpanels aswell
