Hey everyone!

I'm wondering if anyone else has felt these symptoms after major crashes, and kinda wanted to start a support topic. To clarify, I'm already going to counseling, and I'm not looking for pity, rather advice I guess, and seeing if anyone else could be helped.

https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/bad-crash-takes-me-out-of-the-game-for-awhile/56624

After the crash described above, I was ready to hop on a board and go again. However, about 7 months later, I find myself having almost debilitating anxiety about the crash. I was startled awake a couple nights ago, flashing back and watching the car speed up behind me, missing me by inches and me jumping off the board at nearly 35mph trying to avoid it. Once I hit the ground in the dream, I woke up and had to catch my breath. I now find myself constantly asking, almost obsessing about my own mortality after that crash. What if I hadn't jumped off? What if she didn't swerve? What if she swerved the other way and hit me when I jumped? What if she didn't stop, and I had to get home on my own? I understand fully that, because they didn't happen, it's wierd to obsess about. But here we are :joy:  I haven't been on a board in awhile due to battery problems, but that's not related to this. 

I haven't felt this about my first crash, in which I would argue I was more injured. But, that wasn't a life threatening situation, so I suppose not as traumatic.

I guess my question is, after a crash, life threatening or not, has anyone had to deal with this? What did they do to curb the anxiety and get back on the board?

I would say, start slow and build up confidence. Maybe also avoid driving on roads with cars if possible.
About those dreams, dunno, mine faded, but come back sometimes.

I had some anxiety after my crash and I wasn’t nearly going as fast as you were but it was my first fall and first broken bone. After I was healed up I had some anxiety about getting on my board again. I was wearing a helmet and still got a concussion. You just have to take it slow and you will gain your confidence back. You can’t think about the what if’s cause it will eat you up.

The answer is yes probably for everyone to a certain degree that has had a big crash. Everyone deals with it different. For me it was buying all the safety gear I wasn’t wearing before and allowing confidence to build around that. The more you face your fear, the less significant it will feel. This whole community is with you, and, those who’ve crashed likely felt or are feeling to a certain degree, your anxiety.

For Me, it was with an auto crash that caused this type of anxiety, mania and the what ifs. Time will be the biggest factor in getting back on again, but then you also run the risk of never getting on again. Fear of your own mortality is hard to overcome. I think the unsafe feeling you get when you ride is a big part of the thrill. Pending danger and the thrill of the ride can turn on you when something life threatening happens, in a car or on a board.....
Working through it will be hard and I can't say you will ever feel the same again, none of us ever do. We find something different when we face these things and conquer them, the thrill takes on much more meaning I think

i had a pretty bad crash going top speed, 25-30 mph. I fell pretty bad and f'ed up my nice northface jacket. I was pretty scared to get back on the board and im known for being a daredevil. I went slow at first, didn't go on a busy road for a good couple of weeks.

Get riding asap. Take it slow and I mean speed wise. Get used to riding again. 

It’s what I did as soon as I was able to. Hell I even made my board faster after I crashed and tried its top speed which used to be 22 and was now 26 (went from 10s to 12s on meepo hubs). 

Oh I was scared when I tried and it was from the chance of falling again especially since my shoulder was no where near being healed yet. I was still using a sling when walking. Pretty dumb of me honestly. But for me even though I fell badly I wanted get riding asap. I just love it so much as I was also just getting into diy. 

Best would be to take a route that you know by heart and for the first lap check the route while riding to make sure you don’t run into any surprises. The next lap you will be way more confident and you’ll feel that too since you are now carving care free.

I've never had a big crash, I've had falls, pulled muscles and messed my hand up but it was all superficial really. I can totally see how a big fall would put you off. 

Speed seems to be the deciding factor in most of the accidents here, I generally just don't ride faster than I can run off. Perhaps it's age but I'm a calm rider and just enjoy the buzz of floating around. Try get back out nice and calm and just enjoy the ride.

Also, I think you're a big man coming here with this in front of your peers. Most guys would bottle this shit up and go nowhere. 80% of the battle is won when you talk about psychological issues. Keep at it

I like your positive side :) 

@op 

Maybe take it in steps, start on a closed circuit, maybe a park walking route, somewhere where cars cant go. Then move up to the Parking lots, and after that, if you feel comfortable maybe try a low risk road

As everyone else says, time is important, but dont be discouraged if you are stuck at the 'parking lot level' for any extended amount of time, everyone heals differently and theres nothing wrong with that :smile:

The human mind is weird, we have built in mechanisms which allow us to cope after tramatic events. They are instincual and developed from 10a of thousands of years if evolution. The down side is modern events don't always correspond with primordial instincts. As I see it you either have a new fear you need to learn to deal with and ivercome or you have a form of PTSD. 

If the former time is the only thing that helps. Start slow and decide before you do a thing that your going to take no chances. A few days later do it again. When that get boating amount it up a little bit. When that gets boaring amount it up a little more. 

If it's the later, the as much as u hate to say this... Put the board in a closet and find a professional. It's ok to need assistance. We can't be everything every time. Not even to ourselves. 

Good luck.

Big ups for posting this thread. 2017/18 was a tough year for a lot of us. 

I'm pretty sure most people who have suffered a crash or serious injury or lost a friend has had a few moments of anxiety.

It's hard. I know from personal experience that time is your friend. So is interaction with other riders. 

Don't give up.

Yeah I can agree. I've had enough crashes and lost enough friends that I barely even ride anymore. When I do, I stay below 15mph on a single build I have. I crashed when I was trying to get to 40mph once, I've never been above 25 since.

I might be the odd one out here, so it worries me in a different way, but hear me out.
I was hit by a car once, almost hit by another by a close margin, fell at 15 mph, and another at around the same speed. The first broke my Ownboard and threw me a few feet, and the second scraped up my AT board, but only gave me a few scrapes.

For all of these incidents, I felt next to nothing. 

I feel like I should have felt fear, or shock, or something. But I felt next to nothing. Just nothing. Maybe some annoyance and pain, but that's it. 
I'm afraid there's something wrong with me in the sense that I actually didn't feel afraid at all of getting back on the board. I automatically started riding more carefully, but I don't think it was because I was afraid of falling. Just wary of the pain. 
If anyone has an answer for me, I'd like to hear it. I considered the possibility that the shock of the falls and getting hit might have just shut off something in my brain for my own safety because of adrenaline and cortisol, but for similar things to happen and not evoke an emotional response multiple times is weird to me.

@TheFluffiest
Big ups for admitting you have this problem. After my crash, i had issues myself... id look in the mirror and see how fucked up my face was and how its permanently scarred. It could have been so much worse.... a few things that helped me
1- take it slow!!!! Ride around the block at slow speeds. Just to the store and back. These little rides will help you get comfortable 

2- add safety precautions that make you feel safer. More leds to be more visible and more pads to help with the fall... it also pads up your anxiety a bit

3- talk a out it to anyone who will listen. Just tellingg the story and reliving it helps your realize its Just an experience that shouldnt control you

4(optional but worked for me personally)- smoke tons of cannabis lol. Maybe thats more of a personal solution but seriously... you’ll be back on that board eventually.

I'm the same way. I've had a few close calls, more on four-wheelers than boards though. I felt it weird that I wasn't scared, and felt no different than before a wreak that I wasn't able to walk for 7 months after. I don't have a solid answer for you, it just hits some of us differently.

I was told when I crashed my dirt bike into a tree that i need to get back on it asap. I took couple months off and when i got back on I was having issues about riding fast. When i crashed my board I tried to fix it asap to get back on it before all the worries kicked in. Wasnt going fast in the beginning but by the end of the night I was riding throttle pressed all the way.

I'm not too concerned about getting back on the board, the only thing holding me back honestly is money to repair my batteries. I actually rode daily for several months after at similar speeds. The only thing stopping me is problems with batteries, although this has caused a new problem for sure.

It's more just general anxiety now. The next day felt like "fight or flight" the whole day, and I couldn't focus on work because I was constantly on high alert. @mmaner my therapist mentioned mild PTSD and wants to try "brainspotting" to try and help. Evidently the timeline and symptoms line up with it. 

@Trdolan03 there's a couple specific things that I won't get into publicly that makes me kinda predisposed to anxiety and processing things as trauma, even if it isn't.  Just don't ride on busy roads and you probably won't have to deal with it :joy:

Everyone else, thank you for support! If I've learned anything from stuff like this, it's good to talk about it and get community support. I wanted to help other people get help too! 

@Allofyoush everyone processes and expresses trauma differently. There's a possibility your brain compartmentalizes it, and could open that box later. If you (or anyone for that matter) start feeling abnormally angry, anxious, or depressed I highly recommend counseling. There's no shame in it at all. 

Thank you everyone, every time I post for help I remember why I like this community so much.

yes, anxiety, fear is something you have to control, they will not be gone but the more your ride, the more you control how you react. I found a way ... before filming one my improvisation video.. I remember myself "never give up, ever".

Sounds like replacement cost is an issue, that can't really be fixed. This is a sport that costs money. A disproportionate amount, sadly. 

To be frank, I havent gotten back up to the speeds I used to get to after my last crash. But that's not such a bad thing. Going all out at all times isn't necessarily a good thing. 

As long as you can still enjoy riding, I think that's really all that matters.

@Allofyoush @AToasterOfDoom while I don't know the exact details of your accidents, the way you describe them leads me to ask: Did either of you have a "trained emergency response"?
For example:
A person who has properly learned how to react to a fire - stop drop and roll, get outside, look for an extinguisher/ call 911 - is more likely to keep calm in a stressful situation. This is generally true of anyone who has gone through appropriate safety training, whether it's soldiers and police officers or somebody losing control while driving on an icy road. If you have a practised plan for the emergency you won't panic as much OR wonder afterwards "what could I have done differently?"
This does not mean that you shouldn't feel anything at all, ever. Rather, if something does happen, what I've always found useful is to talk with someone about it soon after it happens, the same day if possible. This allows you to look at the event with eye towards understanding exactly what happened and how to prevent it in the future, instead of simply obsessing over it. 
Did either of you have this reaction instead?
Obviously everyone will react differently to an extent, but I think that the key to avoiding the blind panic and fear that occurs is to share it with people who can relate and help figure out how to avoid it in the future.
@TheFluffiest I think this is a very important thread to have opened and I hope that it's helping :slightly_smiling_face:
Take your time, don't push yourself more than you're comfortable with, reach out to anyone you think can help you. That's what we're here for.
God bless this community

@Allofyoush 
It's really not that abnormal. 
Things affect people differently. 
I normally laugh when i get hurt. Even when its really bad. Idk why.  
Now if you're kicking animals and feel nothing there's definitely something wrong with you. 

@TheFluffiest 
Perfectly normal dude. I've been there, i use it. Push myself faster, think i like the extra adrenalin maybe? Its harder when accidents are other peoples faults tho. All you can do is take your time. But don't completely avoid it. It just gets harder the longer you shut out that activity. 
Find somewhere private to ride around. 
As far as dreams go...... there's some things you can do to kinda reset your brain but im not gonna post about it on here. Pm me if you wanna talk about it. 
Keep your head up bud

So last year I had 2 falls, once was my receiver plug was rubbing on the deck so it caused the throttle to cut out under a very hard full throttle launch whiplashed my helmet into the ground, it made me but dizzy I probably had a mild concussion.

Then later in November with a different board 4wd 12s8p Evo I had a motor come loose under full throttle causing the front left belt to get caught in the idler and it threw me into the ground helmet first because I was leaning forward in a full tuck. I don't remember the fall because I was knocked unconscious for quite some time.

I'm finally back to riding a bit now and I can cruise and carve perfectly fine but I'm so so so afraid of actually using the throttle now. Both my accidents came after full throttle attemps now I can't use it to it's full ability like I used to. That's why I'm considering going back to 2wd and use the other drive train on another build.

In part out of fear for cars (and cops) , I sold my regular longboard and went with a solid 17 PLY trampa, gear drive, double receivers and 149 kv motors. I am off-road the most of the time now anyway. 

It's a tank. It has failsafes. It allows me to hit potholes and the dirt in case a car does not see me, which is still frequent (especially on roundabouts). I've got two separate tail lights with individual power supplies. 

I realize many won't want to switch to an mtb build, but it's a heck of a lot safer.

@TheFluffiest You know I'm always open to talk or message if you need it and I wish you the best while you recover from the lasting affects of the accident. Although I have had a few bad accidents I'm lucky to be here without any lasting non-superficial damage and so although it can be a bit difficult to relate to the situation you're in, just know that the community as a whole as well as the people around you are all here for you. 

Although we've only gone on two or three rides together, I miss my riding buddy. Hurry up and finish building that e-bike already man!

i feel you brother. Yesterday i had a small crash myself at 20mph. Nothing serious, just couple of scratches.The guy from the car didn't stopped 

Two piece of advices;

* Continue with the doctor, but don't let fear control you. In anything in this life. If you feel like doing, do it slow, but do it.
* Learn from it. Unfortunatelly most of us only learn by pain. Sometimes things happens in life so we can open our eyes to other stuff. Like been a better person, help others , pay attention to little things in life, search for something bigger than ourselves - not talking about religion but something beyond that. It's up to you.

Thanks for posting this man, surelly will help someone. Love from a Brazilian friend.

I live with anxiety. I've had enough scrapes and crashes to warrant the fear of not getting up again on whatever, but the only (for me) way to beat the feeling is to be in control of it. 

Like others have said, you're a big guy for bringing this to the forefront, especially in a forum that is awash with sarcasm and leg pulling, but it just goes to show how human we all are that you have had the responses you've had so far. It's nice to see and heart warming.

Only you can beat this, but small steps are probably the best course of actions here. Stay in control, be in control.

Good luck man 👍👍

After my big crash over a year ago, I never rode seriously again. It was a combination of getting a driver's license, being afraid, and my mom/family banning the idea of esk8.

Glad you brought up this topic because a lot of us with big crashes can relate to this. 

I still remember everything the day I fell on my face and broke my jaw. The ringing in my ears and looking down on the street to see blood dripping. I knew I fucked up. Worst part is that it was entirely my fault for being undergeared and too new to skateboards to ride at 25mph.

I couldn't eat real food for 2 months. Surgeries, doctors visits, feeling weak all the time. I lost 20lbs and was skinny as hell to begin with.

Dispite all that shit happening, gotta move on. I take my health a lot more seriously now which was an interesting outcome. Just thinking about liquid foods though makes me uneasy...

Well my worst ever injury wasn't from a fall but just as if not more traumatic and it left not just physical but mental scars.

I thought I just needed time to get over it but seeing a counselor helped by allowing me to understand the minor panic attacks and flash backs I was experiencing.

Essentially your subconscious now treats certain instances as dangerous you will need time to make those slowly go away and have your concious brain control your emotions. 

As they say, time heals all wounds...

Btw it took me multiple surgeries and 1.5yrs before I could walk unaided again after my femur broke...

I had my first crash about a year ago and I was able to get back on the board pretty fast.  I was going about 25mp and the board suddenly break when I let going of the trigger.  I fell and had roadrashes all over me and I had 3 little rocks inbeded in my palm for about 1 week.   The crash was my fault because I changed my esc setting and fogot about it.   I was able to get back in the board in a few weeks but still had flashback for About 2 months.  

My latest crash was about 4 weeks ago. I broke my collarbone and I am still recovering.   I am experiencing a lot of anxiety on getting  back on the board because i don't know what casued the accident.   I hope to get back on maybe next week.

Seems like you got the whole community behind you as pretty much all of us can relate to what you are going through.  There are some images that people have posted and it makes me think damn that is life changing injury.  A lot of us know what happened when we crashed and most of it was our faults.  I think the scariest would be like yours where you know why you fell but it was not your fault.  The unknown is scary and the psychological impacts that things have on us is even worse.  You just have to start out slow in a setting and environment you are comfortable with and slowly expand. The one thing that I think this forum has that all the other forums I have been on in my life don't have is a sense of brother/sisterhood.  Sure there are some member that you like less than other and there will always be scammers but the people that are active on here  is basically like the family you have never met.

I'm 42 and have had 3-4 major injuries in my life... and after every one of them, I basically have to heal up twice. The first one was, of course, the actual physical injury. the 2nd was the mental /emotional -- it generally took about 2 to 3 times as long to heal up. 

The mental/ emotional injury took conscious effort to heal up. For me, the first part was identifying it. Figuring out what scenarios set off the same feelings on anxiety/helplessness. Second, was mitigating --- figuring out what actions I could take the prevented the feelings or made them bearable. and the last was basically getting used to it -- once I _knew_ that x situation would cause anxiety, and I had taken appropriate actions to mitigate risks, then it was doable to just go with the anxiety and after enough time, the emotional tenderness/sore spots healed up.

It's one of the things I think we as a society kinda miss the boat on. We are both a body and a mind.
When our mind gets hurt -- we know it can affect our body. Notice how much easier it is to catch a cold when you're stressed out?
So... when we get a nasty injury, [surprised pikachu] It leaves some mental trauma to be cleared up.

Of course brains are weird, so my stubbed toe could leave me with trauma about coffee tables lurking in the dark, while Bob's table saw amputations leave him asking what's the big deal...

This so true.  I dislocated both knees in a skiing accident and never skied again.  Friend of mine snapped  both his ankles wake boarding and 8 weeks later was back on the water.  The fear of intense pain never leaves you though.  So I obviously tell him that my injury was much more painful than his :rofl:
I took a tumble the other week on my latest creation and while nothing but road rash and hurt pride occurred I am now somewhat nervous about hitting the streets again.  Have checked the board inside and out and can not find a thing wrong with it but still it applied brakes and threw me off.  The reason I'm still nervous is because I can not minimise risk if I can't find an issue.  All I can do is wait out the anxiety and slowly get back to being carefree again.  Either that or have a couple of stiff drinks before riding  Joking  
To OP @TheFluffiest  
Jake, well done and very brave of you to air this subject when us chaps are supposed to be so "**tough**" apparently.  Good luck with the recovery my friend.

Hey everyone, I thought I would mention something I talked to my therapist about. Due to my proximity to the Paradise California (burned in a wildfire) a ton of therapists were trained in what they called Brainspotting. Evidently, most of his patients saw results immediately, and almost all of them were able to release their anxiety of the fire. It is specifically designed to treat trauma, and was created while treating survivors of major events like Hurricane Katrina and the destruction of the World Trade Centers. In my town, it is currently being used to treat survivors of the fire. 

He has mentioned it can help cure phobias, "big T" and "little t" PTSD, anxiety, depression, and chronic pain and fatigue created by stress. I highly recommend it to EVERYONE, especially @ervinelin @Boardnamics @Battosaii in light of your major accidents and traumatic events. 

It looks like this has helped a lot of people, so I'm happy to get this out. Psychological health is extremely important, and lack of it can be more dangerous than lack of physical health. There is nothing wrong with getting help, and in fact should be encouraged

Also, if you do show symptoms like mine (flashbacks to the event, dreams, seemingly irrational anxiety or obsessing about possibilities, intrusive thoughts, etc.) you very well could have a form of PTSD like @mmaner suggested. 

As my therapist explained, there are two types of trauma. Big T and little t. Big T trauma is life threatening events, survivors of disasters, serious car crashes, warfare, etc. Little t trauma is more like my sort of crash where it wasn't life threatening, or layered trauma like childhood or relationship abuse. Either way, trauma seems to come up when something happens out of your control. For instance, my first crash was completely my fault (showing off without the skill to do so), and I haven't had any problems. But, the second one was completely out of my control. The car didn't see me, since I was riding at night and the light on my back went out without my knowledge. 

Thank you everyone, PLEASE keep sharing your experiences. I feel this is an extremely important topic!

I agree that mental health is important. Full blown PTSD can be crippling, I was lucky in that I was never diagnosed with PTSD and my treatment was quite straight forward.

Unfortunately where I come from I had difficulty finding therapists, let alone other people, with my particular injury/trauma. 

In addition the moment I went to get professional help I had issues further down in life with insurance and other matters which required me to constantly prove that I am sound of mind. Very irritating really.

Anyway ride safe guys just be happy that you are still alive...

I've had a few bad accidents in 2016 broke my collar bone snowboarding.
![IMG_20180419_090742|666x500](upload://9zEMksvofsYw9OUHRSrI2Y019gu.jpeg) 

In 2017 broke my leg once I got into eboarding (it was a freak accident where my foot slipped and fully extended on the ground)
![IMG_20180317_184832_697|500x500](upload://3uzIBwsiOXr0rOYW0wcLP4PvKgN.jpeg) 
![output|690x389](upload://1xrbYzW9qEaopZvei1zOWQwzpTA.jpeg) 

Late 2017 early 2018 got in a crash where I work up in the hospital with a broken thumb and massive concussion where to this day I do not know what happened.
![IMG_20180509_104716_970|690x451](upload://ryGlpu6qXPnF92v0VBUJWYDTwJi.jpg) 

Had 3 surgeries in 3 years and to this day I do not regret it. It also helps that I am in NYC and the crew here is very supportive and we are all a bit crazy. When I broke my leg and during recovery after like 6 months before I was ready I was riding around around 10-20 mph only around my neighborhood for like 2 months. Took my time getting comfortable at my pace. Then took the KALYNYC out once I got my legs back and my confidence  back. Also I've always had alot of support from the NYC crew and it helped alot. And I don't ride as much as life catches up with me but I still love the rush of going 30-40 mph and weaving through NYC traffic.
But at the end of the day I guess I'm saying find a group of guys you can ride with and encourage you to ride safe but also at your pace. Don't rush into anything you are not comfortable with.

I compressed 3 disks, cracked a vertebrae and tore a mussel in my back.
This was last spring and it still hurts. It not in my head that's the problem, its the pain, and not wanting to do a prescription to counter it.
Long after the anxiety has gone, its the physical recovery that remains.
Also broke my Scaphoid and fractured my Radius in a separate incident, was pretty much standing still and went strait down on it ...... 4.5 months for that one as well.

I think the major problems of riding electric skateboards are that nobody(cardrivers)can handle and even realize that we move motorized and the speed we are going on roads or even on bike lanes. When I see videos of people riding eboards in traffic, specially in the USA, there are much more reasons for bad accidents then they imagine. Wearing safety gear does not save you from anything that could happen if you are not seen by car drivers or if you just go down your board at 30mph. Even green lights are no warranty you can cross the road as ( save) as walking or driving a car, because nobody knows about this type of motion we all love so much and car drivers are just Overwhelmed to situations like that.Another problem is that very much of electric skaters are newbies to skateboarding in general and they get hurt very fast if something gets them in trouble while riding. They never learned how to fall the right way (mostly possible) and surly break their bones at their first crash.I wish for much more respect about their boards and much more respect in traffic and others around them. 
Example: When I go for a ride to the supermarket which is about 1 mile away, I would be dead three times if I'm not focused as fuck and could not break for everything at any speed, even when i cross the road by having green lights.Thats fact! 
The most seen riding style you can watch in videos is to get on the road and going as fast as the board goes. Like them idiots in their AMGs or Porsche cars, not caring for others and themselves.This behavior will automatically lead to bad accidents specially for newbies in skateboarding in general.I can tell you from my own experience that going fast on a boards is dope, but you always have to know your limits and you always have to pay a lot of attention to others in traffic.Otherwise you will be dead, sooner or later, even if no other traffic member is the cause for that, because it was just your high speed run the last time...
Sorry for not staying on topic and sounding like a geek or something, but fear is some kind of a protection system. If you are afraid of riding, don't ride! If you want to ride Nevertheless, realize you are one of the weakest parts in traffic and ride slow and save not to hurt others or get hurt by them. Just ride well known routes, where you know every crack and bump in the street. Be ready to break every time to zero and beware of dogs and kids on the sidewalks...
Something about lights:  In germany where i live is electric skateboarding illegal. That is one of the reasons i do not use any lights on my boards at night, because I DONT WANT TO BE SEEN. I got many,many years of experience on skateboards and this works totally fine for me. Now some or maybe all of you say that I am an idiot and that myself is to blame if something happens. Hahaha, thats right! But so are you. It is just your fault if you cannot handle the device you are riding or if you ride like everybody has to notice you as a cool and hip electric skateboard rider going full speed in traffic by watching clouds in the sky. Just by being legal on the streets doesn't mean you can skate, even if you were without any accident for lots of miles. Keep that in mind.
Another thing I need to mention are the trigger style remotes. I know lots of us love them and they are used to them, but in my opinion, they could be an additional problem when things get out of control. the fact that your fingers are "trapped" on the trigger seems deadly as fuck for me, but everyone has to know for his own. Same I think about a dead mans switch, but I'm just mentioning.
Hopefully you get rid of your psychological warfare and hopefully you can enjoy electric skateboarding again, maybe with a different style of riding.
Stay save my friends.
peace

I won't lie... after my last crash it took me a while to get on my board again.  Shit sucked, since I love my dual 6374 setup.  It was my third build, on a drop deck, 107s... smooth ASF, and just a blast to ride around the area.  Then the antispark failed and left me with slight concussion going around 30-35mph.  

I have gone down on a mountain bike countless of times, skateboards, and even my motorcycle yrs ago.  None of those phased me, mostly because I think.........I saw it about to happen.  Like on my R6, I went down because of a chick in an SUV clipped me onto the shoulder and i laid the bike down.  I was highly upset but a week later I was riding again.  

I think it was the unexpected failure of electronics which has caused me angst... which isn't me and that bother me even more.  When my head bounced off that pavement which such force it just made me think differently about esk8.  I then realized that without that helmet, it was done dealing.  I mean I got whiplash from this accident.  Neck and ribs were sore for a week.  

After the crash I had my board in pieces figuring out what the hell happened.  After I figured it out, it stayed in pieces for weeks.  When buddies were asking when we were going to ride, I would then just say, well....waiting on my helmet, can't ride.  Even though I have a half helmet and can easily ride my less powerful board... I chose not to even chance it.  

It has taken about a month to get over that anxiety..I guess you can say, and I am back in full force going on to the next build.  I am very determined to get back into the swing of things and let loose.  The first real test is going back up to max speeds and feeling comfortable.  Still waiting on my full face to get here, but when it does, I will take that challenge.  I am sure it will take me a week or so....but I will get back to it.  

Weather is getting warm again... and it is time!  Can't wait to finish my new projects and start enjoying my ride!

I lost my arm above the elbow less than two years ago in a work accident. I picked up esk8 because I lost video games and guitar, my only two hobbies. 

Then about 2 month in I took a NASTY fall, breaking both sides of my jaw and half my teeth. I got a full face and it was easy to step back on.


3 weeks ago my metroboard dual locked the wheels at 25+ mph. I fell, knocked the wind out my chest. Finally sat up and my vision went 99% white. Was out in the middle of trails and was freaked out. Knew I had broken my stump and my knee was killing me. I rode home slowly and after sitting down I instantly passed out. Woke up and my hoodie sleeve was saturated with blood. Turns out the tip of the bone broke off and was sticking out the end of my stump, and had another massive break half way up. My “scraped “ knee ended up looking like an axe wound. Went to the ER. Had knee and arm surgery the next day. Was super hard mentally to realize that I had once again just destroyed myself. My prosthetic company was supposed to be making me an arm protector. 

But every time I fall, I hit my stump. There was literally just skin between cement and bone. No fat or muscle. 

I went for a ride a few days ago, and I’m totally freaked out about falling and hitting this arm again. I’m going to snag some high end knee pads, but am lost on how to protect this arm. And it’s really kinda freaking me out, especially with me moving to a newer faster board. Fuck.

Do you wear a prosthetic? If you can afford one they're pretty neat, just slap a slide puck to the palm of it lol. It sure is nice to have a built in knee pad when I fall in mine.

Fuck dude.... we gotta find a solution for protecting that arm.
I know it's not the same thing but when I was riding around with my broken arm in a cast I would strap my arm to my stomach to prevent me from putting it out and injuring it in a fall.
Need like a little stump helmet or something......

For me it has always been important to get right back in the fray as soon as possible after a crash. Stems from my days on the BMX track and learning to clear a huge tabletop, failing and getting back up to hit it again.

Recently I took a massive hit to my left side and it was important for me to at least get back on my board and cruise, I need to continue to take it easy for another 3 to 4 weeks but I am making sure I am getting out for some rides to keep from feeding the anxiety.

Main lesson learned is I need to practice riding in a crouched stance more, being 6'2" makes for some wicked forces when falling at 40 mph. My crash would have been nothing if I had been crouching better.

It is similar to PTSD. The feeling of anxiety and try to get back on. I have a few but I manage to overcome the anxiety to get back on. But it does not mean you get rid of it. But it makes you to become more conscious.

I’d hate to break a $10,000 body powered arm or a $125,000 myo arm. I use ottobock liners and all I need is basically the top half of my body powered arm. They tried to go all complicated with a one way air valve and a silicone inner/carbon fiber outside shell and a weird parachute thing to pull my arm in.


The PTSD is real. I can’t fall into a deep sleep without having insane and terrible nightmares, so I “sleep” on a 4 foot long couch (I’m 6’2”) with tv and lights on. I don’t really sleep but I also don’t wake up to the cops beating down my door because I’ve been screaming “help I’m going to die, 4850 Leetsdale!!!”  over and over again for half an hour. Not ideal I suppose.

Young men by nature take risks. These electric skateboards are great fun but we are risking our well being every time we  go out at speed around the streets. The anxiety you experience after a trauma like this is normal IMO. It is telling you to reassess what you are doing. We all need to take a close look at what we are doing. We are standing on a small flat board going at high speed on rough asphalt with bumps and holes around cars with drivers who will not always see you. It is very dangerous. After having a couple of mishaps I only ride around 20kph max. I ride natural so I have my left foot toes angled towards the front of the board so it makes it easier to jump off if I have to and the speed is not so high so I can slow down on my feet. I try to use cycle paths only and just take it easy going to destinations. Yes I did get back on my board when I fell off and the anxiety I had getting back on the board was telling me take it easy, stop taking risks.
