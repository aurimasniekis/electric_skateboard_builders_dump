Thankfully all low speed low energy, but yesterday a bicycle that was pointing forward suddenly goes right, right into my path. T boned him while yelling "Duuuuuuude!!!!!!". Wasn't going very fast so I ran off, and he got laid out. He asked if I was okay, so instead of yelling at him, I grunted, and skated off...

Today, I had a feeling like the remote was glitching, it cleared up, then full brakes. Dust myself  off (thanks @michaelcpg for the armored shirt recommendation, @psychotiller on the used TSG Pass) then test on sidewalk, no response on remote. Open it up, and I see burn marks on 1 pin on the receiver (mini 2.4gz, split ppm). It's intermittent... 

I shove the receiver into some corner in the enclosure that puts pressure on the pins, test. Seems okay. Button up, take off sloooowly, and full brakes knocks me off again within 5 feet. Couldn't run out even though it was like walking speed! I think my body had committed to trying to stay on... Walk to subway...

I think I have slight strains from squeezing various muscles trying to stay on the board (foot, ribs), and some very minor scratches, forarm and knee.

Takeaways:

- Flannel armor shirt is amazing for summer (Speed and Strength Rust and Redemption)
- Mechanix gloves was sufficient for low speed fall
- On eskate I always slam on my front shoulder/hip/knee. Cargo shorts kind of do the job, but just a front kneepad would probably help a lot. Still don't know about hip -- can't commit to spandex underwear for commuting. ;)
- bicycles... My 2 non-equipment-failure crashes were bicycles. #1 crossing against the light super slowly without looking up the road, I was a bit inexperienced, woke up staring at sky, no broken bones, decent amount of rash. #2 t-boned a dude, scratch on forearm. And I had a scare once, someone trying not to put a foot down while stopped at an intersection, he misanticipated my speed/direction, and crashed in my wake.
- my super reliable mini remote finally failed me, in a weird weird way. I don't know how to anticipate/detect/prevent/stay-safe from this failure mode... Gonna repair and retire that receiver, and swap in a spare. I did a lipo mod to this remote. I guess I'll do the same mod to another remote. Hm what did @lowGuido say? "solder all the things?" I really don't want to solder the ppm wire to the receiver lol. But the connector was fully seated in the receiver. The burn mark was on the circuitboard at the base of the rightmost pin. Maybe solder joint failed due to wiggling/vibration. Perhaps hotglue to stabilize the next one... 
- all my eskate crashes, I've gone off the front. The numbers suggest I can concentrate on protection on my front side.
- I've learned from previous crash to carry cellphone and other breakables and sharp hard stuff on the rear side pockets. And no more wristwatch. This is proving wise.
- I don't get to join the one-arm club (yet).

I like the idea of hot-gluing all connectors.  Fast, secure yet removable.  I've started hot-gluing my motor connectors.

I wonder if this is why they don't recommend split-Y PPM :slight_smile:  Please send piccies of receiver when you get it torn apart.

Sorry no pics tonight, ran out of energy.

But I swapped receiver/remote, and reused my soldered ppm splitter. Still intermittent! Put it under the microscope, and I see one of the solder joints cracked -- not visible to my bare eyes. It looks like the clear reason for the dodgy connection. This splitter has more than 1000 miles on it.

Coincidentally I had ordered some ppm splitter cables from amazon, they had come in yesterday. Not really sure about the quality, but I'll give it a spin tomorrow. Maybe with the knee pad lol.

There is soot and black spooge on one pin on the receiver at the pcb. Maybe some metal eaten away.

I'll post pics soon.

My fall was relatively gentle, but the armored flannel did the job, front shoulder is intact, barely felt anything. Feel a bit of a twinge now though. :slight_smile:

The flannel flows air really well. I chose this one over ones with more kevlar coverage that looked like they wouldn't flow air as much.

If you're moving, it might not be so terrible. Maybe soak it down before heading out :slight_smile:

Technically 2xAA means 3v?

@b264 tested full voltage lipo. But, @SkaterBoy58 came up with the idea to put a diode inline to drop the voltage another .7v (genius).

So sad, I'll retire that remote to bench testing. I haven't even run through one cycle on the lipo.

@Mattmccrary8 wtf that's gnarly. I'm glad you had the helmet on.

been running my modified mini with a small lipo and dropping diode for a month or so with no issues
fully charged lipo (4.2V) gives about 3.5/3.6v on mini- you could add two diodes for more volt drop
think i charge it about every two weeks but i ride every day.

With a diode it will be fine. AA Batterys are fully charged at 1.8V which results in 3.6V for 2 in series. Please check the antenna on the receiver. Maybe it was bended too much. 
One of my mini remotes has the problem that the potentiometer on the remote seems to have a loose connection or a fault. When i touch the poti from the side the signal changes dramatically without even turning the poti.
Tried to solder the connections again but did not make a change. My other 2 work great.

@Mattmccrary8 Glad to see your not in a wheel chair, Were you actually wearing a helmet this time?

On a different note, I never take my helmet for granted It's a false seance of security, 
I always fall protecting my precious Head fluids and face.

If you let it dry out you will go through the pain of your skin growing back. Shit even your leg hair growing can be painful and itchy :rofl: while not as intense as losing skin. It also comes with no adrenaline and aches and aches...
If you have some minor ones you might chose to let them dry out... ideally if you haven't dealt with this sort of wound a few times seek some advice.
"Opsite" might be suitable, will depend on how much exudate the wounds secrete.

@Cobber  you just reminded me that my wound was itchy! :joy:
Got like a 3.5x2 Inch Scrape on my arm.


IF this is on topic guys, Would you ever recommend someone just to Use sterile soap and nothing else?
Or should they also use peroxide or rubbing alcohol say on a 4x2 inch road rash?

My first cleaning I typically clean with warm water and soap. Then rinse the fresh wound in alcohol (only the first time). 

Depending on the size, I either start with Alocain creme(if small and not to deep) or go directly to a&e oinments with a tagaderm dressing.

I've also used seran wrap before when I'm out of tagaderm. But I wrap the seran wrap in gauze so it can't get ripped and open to air. Basically what tattoo artist do after they hamburger your skin.

Im editing this. I'm no scientist or doctor.

But normally superficial wounds are easily cleaned with sanatizing temperature water. Severe road rash with sanatizing temperatures is..well excruciating. While I trust soap and warm water to do it's job as a surfactant and get road dirt out. I don't trust it for the first cleaning. I cannot mentality bring myself to not use use a light spray of alcohol before packing my wounds. Because who knows what was on the street. Soaps primary job is to suspend oils and organics to be washed away, which is all I do for subsequent cleanings and re-bandage. Just roads are covered in metals, and are outside, it's very easy to get a major tetanus infection. Especially if you haven't had a shot in 5+ years.

And the pcb shots. The enclosure looks superglued. Will open it soon but for now these shots look good enough. Not really sure what's going on there. The solder joint for the pin to the pcb looks mechanically okay, but that black crud...

Honestly MoeBro for electric application I think it is as simple as making the angle of the deck tips directional. Instead of 35/35, make them 45/25... problem solved :nerd_face:

(or have a 10 degree wedge/dewedge kit)

In fact @Nowind, JensoBro you wanted some projects while your in recovery? what do you think about a cnc wedge/dewedge kit for Trampa decks?

The black crud on receiver looks like water corrosion. Like a few drops got in there. 

As for the spliter, sux to have such a physically tiny issue bring you down. Goes to show everything from the throttle trigger to the motors is mission critical.

Yeah RIP BigBro

I'd have gone for a bigger split f/b... but for sure ad nauseam we have discussed this. The trampa is a fun freeride dirt deck. Its not a speed deck. There is a oscillation that develops at speed front to back cause of the deck flex/bushing/springs and also a secondary problem when the deck is driven from the rear, then coming off of throttle load it releases a lot of energy like a big composite spring that is uncontrollable.
Maybe more thane in the bushings would help a bit, more with the former less with the latter?

For me who is now riding all directional set ups it just feels like what I would like to be comfortable... but hey most of the kids are riding 50/50?

Most of the people that are going to buy these kind of board, aren't always experimented enough to understand speed wobble. It is not a matter of if but when, because sadly the trampa deck and truck are mainly made to handle pushing speed not high speed.

Dammit I planted again. 2 times in fact since the original post lol. I'm gonna make a post because putting up the original post helped organize my thinking, and learning from the events.

#1 going super slow walking speed, saw a very depressed manhole cover, thought i could get around, but no. the 90mm flywheel stopped immediately, and off the front I went. Same fall pattern as the earlier two, so once again I landed with my front elbow going into my ribs. Pretty bad this time, I though I broke a rib, but it was just soft tissue damage. Took forever to feel somewhat okay, actually until about 3 days ago, forcing me to ride gingerly, and put aside the Raptor 2 that just arrived :frowning: :frowning:

What did I learn from this? Don't try to be greedy.

#2 today, started to rain, started to rush a bit trying to beat the rain. Lost traction avoiding a bike, went down. Thankfully, pretty slow, and no traffic. Scraped the back of the Pass. Didn't feel much on impact but now I'm starting to feel stuff. Front wrist took some impact, and and rear hip joint feels a bit odd. Tiny rash on rear knee. Diagnosis? I didn't learn enough from #1. To add to it, I lost my front glove in the morning part of the commute, which probably would have lessened the impact on the front hand. Weirdly, no rash on the bare hand!

Lessons (re)learned: don't rush, don't "go for it" unless I'm willing to not make it every now and then.

What's working:
- Helmet TSG Pass
- Strength and Speed flannel shirt with armor. This thing has been worth every penny, especially in the summer heat
- The Mechanix M-Pact gloves are nice, with the bit of 3D0 armor at the base of the palms. Can still control the mini remote
- Moving phone to the right side (rear) pocket
- Cargo shorts with no knee pads

Hey @Mattmccrary8 how're you healing up?

it seems counter intuitive, but solder joints are a bad thing if you can avoid them.  crimps are much more flexible and wont crack.
theres a reason airplanes are full of crimp connectors, not solder joints on wires.

Preaching to the choir. Just bought a AMP 59250 and have a bid on a 59239-4. :)

I switched to amazon bought splitters but I'll probably rebuild using the cute little splitter pcbs from hansenhobby (back to solder but mechanically supported).
