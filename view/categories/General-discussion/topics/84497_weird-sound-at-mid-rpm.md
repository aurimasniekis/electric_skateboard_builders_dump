Hi guys,

Can anyone help me figure out what this sound is when I hit mid throttle on my board?

Looks like there is more resistance on that one motor, probably a broken magnet

Could also be a shot motor bearing or too tight bearings that are on each of the shaft sides, inside.

Or lose winding...
Best to open up the motor and have a look.

Thought you were running gears until I enlarged the vid lol.  Yeah only a look inside will find that issue but check your warranty status first.
