So looks like gizmag have review the new BB
They really haven't said much about it haha. 
Even say their claim of being the lightest is no longer valid. 
Can't say I'm taken by it.

"While that might be plenty of battery life for a scoot around campus or a quick trip to the store, it did leave Boosted's Boards some way behind its competitors. Other models like the Marbel Board and Yuneec's E-Go Cruiser will travel 10 mi (16 km) and 18 mi (30 km), respectively, while the powerful Evolve Carbon GT we reviewed earlier this month is well out ahead with a monster range of 31 mi (50 km)."
