I'm fairly new the world of long boards. I want to grind down the tail end of my drop through deck so there would be enough room for a reverse motor mount and motor to tilt upwards away from the ground. Would this make the board to weak under load and cause a break?

It shouldn't, because the material behind the truck mounting points isn't load bearing unless there's a kicktail.

Have done this to two boards, both are fine, just don't cut off too much.
