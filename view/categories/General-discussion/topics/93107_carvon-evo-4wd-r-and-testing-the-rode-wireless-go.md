This is the Carvon EVO 4WD R the most powerful and fastest skateboard that was once built....I was only brave enough to take it to 56km/h today but I took it to 65km/h on a previous video but this baby can most definitely hit 80-90km/h. I am out for a quick ride testing the Rode Wireless Go mic in high winds without a windscreen to see how it handles it.

Not sure what happened to Carvon and Jerry it is too bad he could have been on top of the skateboard world by now but this was a great build it is solid and still smokes them all I haven't met a skateboarder that can keep up..LHB did the build worst case I send it to him and pay him for work that may be needed down the road..

You need to meet the @MoeStooge then! @evoheyax might also be down for some race.

I agree its a very good build but if the drives pack up then you're pretty much screwed.  Jerry has gone dark owing a lot of people money so try not to rub their noses in it too much.  Enjoy the board.  My own evo will hit over 70kmh and @Battosaii has one that will smoke that as does @Deckoz  Lots of very silly death machines in here.

I wasn't trying to rub anything to anyones nose I was just posting my experience with the board once again..I am aware that Jerry went dark but just recently found that out.. I was away from here since last summer..

I'm not a guy that races on skateboards those years are long gone I'm 63 but I do every now and then enjoy a fast speed on this baby but if they want to race then I should because of my age be able to pull out the beast that I build called the Scorpion + and then I'm game...😁😀🤩🤪😄😅

I think i saw your review way back when you first got the board.  I enjoyed it and the enthusiasm and respect you displayed to lhb and carvon.  Almost made me jump on the carvon bandwagon.  If I had I might not like you very much now :joy: 
I do find it a crying shame that a product with so much potential has been wasted by bad business etiquette.  It only hurts the industry and community as a whole.  The product and brand has weight but no investor worth their salt would touch it with a ten foot bargepole now.  Shame.  

That scooter looks like a demon

Damn!   Sounds like you’re pretty confident about your 4wd.   I still gotta give it to @MoeStooge for the win.   His shit besides being scary fast they also scream like a demon escaping from hell witch many people might like that’s including myself of course 🤣🤣

I wouldn't use my Carvon that's for sure too old to go that fast without holding on but I have no problem going 100+ on my Dualped Scorpion + that I posted in my previous reply 😁😁😁

I think you are the only one with this build and no one else got theirs. At least I haven’t read about anyone getting one of these. 

I was lucky to get my own orders delivered with v4spdr-r and torque drive. 

Both have been sold now btw and I’m very happy with belts although I did snap 6 or so already. Gear drive is next. 

Enjoy your build/buy. That scooter is dope.

@HI-DEF-DEPOT  Bring the Dualped to the hill. We could do a heads up race and throw back some beers after.   Backside Brawl race#3 SoCal 🏁🏁

I’d love to try one of these some time. I love all 4wd boards!

I’m sure the carbon r will outrun my board in the long run as it has a higher top speed. But you won’t keep up with me off the line. I do 0-30mph in 2.5 seconds. If you don’t lean to a 60 degree angle forward or higher, you will fall off on a full throttle acceleration.

Moe builds boards with similar acceleration but insanely high top speeds. As far as I know, he has the real speed record unless @Lucifer has manage to beat it, which wouldn’t surprise me. These guys still need to get Guinness so they can make it official already!
