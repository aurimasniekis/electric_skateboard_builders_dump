Just wondering if anyone has tried doing a quad belt-drive board?  Is it because 4 belt drives would consume too much power and generate too much torque?

because it is not necessary, and too heavy in my opinion, There are mtb with 4 geared motors but heaven seen belts yet?

ive only see one board with awd and thats the carvon evo but i think it uses hub motors. also only seen dual diagonal with belts.maybe lack of clearance or room would be why.

@psychotiller has built an AWD belted board. It's a 10s 5p. It was getting better mileage than my dual 10s 4p board while riding off-road. Once you ride it you'll feel it's necessary. :rofl:

This pretty much, proves everything you guys think (too heavy, too much drag, lack of clearance, and that there aren't any ) 

Wrong..

Can you give a rough estimate about the cost to build such a board?

I've got $2,300 in that one, counting only materials that will make it to final assembly.

i've beuilt enough of them to know they're utterly pointless. 

All scenarios can benefit from dual drive, either dual diagonal or dual rear, or even dual front. 

Only drag racing or hauling a fuckton of weight warrant all wheel drive. 

They're not as efficient, don't deliver enough "moar power" to justify literally doubling the cost of the build, and only add a tiny amount of top end while consuming more battery basically all the time.

From what I‚Äôve read, over the last couple of years, only a handful of guys ever took the plunge and built a 4WD street board, as their main ride.

In 2016, I built a 4WD Hummie Hub board.  One time, when I was down 2 VESCS, I rode it for a few weeks as a 2WD; same board.  That build was more efficient as a 4WD.  Less load per motor, less heat, more climbing torque.  *secondary point: 2 VESCS down and the board still drove‚Ä¶

The 4WD boards pull better on steep hills, dirt, grass, gravel, and are better at negotiating some obstacles that you‚Äôd have to go around on a 2WD.  The brakes are way better, on all surfaces.  I prefer the planted way a 4WD handles and delivers its torque. 

Looking at the component spreadsheet, for that belt setup that I posted in this thread, if I edit every part quantity which had a (4) and replace it with a (2), the resulting dual drive would only be 27% cheaper than the 4WD.  That‚Äôs not double the cost, if you‚Äôre building your own.  Labor-wise, it probably does feel like building 2 boards at once, and a builder may factor that.

Your points are also well taken and I think there is a place for them in the scenario you just mentioned.  Thanks again.

I've built 5 of them so far, all belts. 

terrain definitely mattters. Every time i hear somebody justify 4wd, the statements also contain the phrases "dirt", "gravel", and "hill climbing" 

Anyone over 220 pounds could likely see some benefit from 4wd. 

If you want to maximise top end, you need it to overcome the last bit of wind resistance that your tuck just eliminate. 

the other 99.9% of the time it's just there eating juice. And splitting your load across four motors while doubling your rolling resistance isn't really more efficient. Its already been proven by several people that the most efficient drive is a single motor setup. Two is a compromise for what is notabley more power. 


Now hub motors and direct drives... that's different.

Work in progress, but this will be my monster 4x4 / Golf board eventually.

4WD, 72volts. Just landed in my shop yesterday, we're going to try and keep it in one piece this time.

We found different results..But we used different motors and a different battery.

That's not a build, its a china factory board from Tronix. We've been testing and experimenting with them for another skate company.

i agree. Its basically a truck. In fact, jake pushed an SUV up the road with it the other day. It's so big you can really throw your body around on it and yank the sides up to carve deep. They weigh a metric fuckton but if you wanted something for true all terrain this is it. It will even climb stairs. 

Wouldn't be very good for urban commuting as its too huge to reasonably expect to drag it indoors anywhere.
