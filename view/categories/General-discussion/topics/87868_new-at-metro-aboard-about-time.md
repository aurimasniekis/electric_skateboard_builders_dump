He did, we've been talking about it for awhile.  

It looks nice, there are some equipment choices I don't really understand yet and the lights are just, well, not good.  Overall looks like a decent build with 6374s and VESC(s).

It’s pretty heavy too with 12.7 kg in street setup. Mine weighs 12.6 kg with 12s6p. 
I’m guessing this will be a 10s5p so the extra weight would be the custom trucks which seem to have built in lights, and tensioner system. 
The deck might be a bit heavier too I suppose.

Pretty sweet looking board actually. Love the drop, big dual motors, lights, big penumatic wheels, location of charging port and the switch(I'll probably copy that :D)

I wonder what these springs are for

The design looks appealing, yet an advertised top speed of 25 MPH for a $2500 board is a very hard sell - presumably because it can’t go much faster with a surf-skate Carver clone up-front. 

Yet add in fake Trampa Superstars and it kind of feels like an insult for $2500. MetroBoard chose the cheapest, no-name brand wheel that they could find (probably here). 

I wish them luck, sincerely. Beautiful design, very DIY influenced.  If I find the deck I’ll post it here.

As you said my friend.   The biggest flaw I see here is the lack of top speed 

How much torque can someone possibly need.    Seen a case where rider kept blaming Metroboard for a couple of crashes when really.   All there was was too much torque at low speed.  

Lots of Low speed torque + inexperienced rider    Not a good combination imo 

New board does look sikk.  That I can say 🤘🏼

It's probably because the Metroboard dual drives have ridiculous amounts of torque.  As far as I know, their older dual drives use 110kv 6374 motors on 17/36 gearing with 107mm wheels at 10S

Glad he’s keeping the remote. I think DKP is a bad idea but ilans pretty convinced. He’s actually going to swap the escs in my dual drive to the new ones, I’m excited to see how it rides.

I had a 55 mile. Sold it for a dual drive. The dual drives braking stopped me dead at 25. He said the vescs smooth it out a ton. This will have so much torque for off road. 

Same battery as the current dual drive. 16 amp hour.

Excellent points as always. 

I have a feeling with dual 6374, they’re limiting top speed in the ESC - and that’s not a bad thing on DKP per se. 

The challenge I see is diminishing returns for the $2500 price.

MetroBoard appears to have built the nicest Evolve Carbon GT, ever, for $2500.  

Is the nicest Evolve worth $2500?  Maybe. The Carbon GT costs almost that much - yet that’s a prosumer board and this looks true DIY.  By that comparison I think it makes some sense. 

MetroBoard can focus their marketing and ambassadors (if they have any) on Evolve conversions and back-to-back there should be no competition.

If I buy one, the review will be both comprehensive and merciless for a $2500 sled - yet if I own it, genuine CNC Trampa MegaStars will be installed before it’s powered on for the first time and the ESC will be flashed or replaced.  

I am most curious about the CNC DKPs, and dialing them in to do a safe, repeatable 35 MPH.

They use such ghetto parts that it would take $700 to rebuild it with a Hoyt remote, real Trampa SuperStars, Unity, etc. 

At $3200 finished, for an improved Evolve... idk.  We have so many superior options that are truly superior at $3k.. 

Who would want this metroboard more than a Bioboards with gearboxes?  Hard to say. :)

Metroboards biggest selling point is their reliability and robustness, they have never been the sleekest, fastest and fanciest. 
Bioboards on the other hand, reliability is a big unknown I would not go 40mi/h with the Nano X controller, I am not certain which Vesc is used in the Metroboard but the Unity used in the Bioboards is still in its infancy (I use one) and has to proof itself a bit longer.

Thanks my friend. I selected bioboards as one example of dozens; I am very certain all of us can find a better board for $2500 in every category - just maybe not a better Evolve GT.

Fake Trampa wheels and AA remotes do not speak to me of robustness, personally, yet I am willing to buy one and show precisely what it can and cannot do. I’ve been known to make a mistake, here and there. ;)

I totally agree with @topcloud, there’s not enough bang for the buck. Although I do like the mini remote, on a 2500$ board you should have a remote such as Hoyt puck, or make a custom remote. Also fake superstars just dissapoints me. The only thing I see that I personally like is the new truck design and the beautiful deck. Although metroboard is very reliable, and I respect ilan, anyone can build a board that goes 30mph + for less that has better performance. This is just another case of not enough bang for the buck. As DIY builders, we have high expectations  and love speed and torque. Metroboard provides the torque but not enough speed. I hope Ilan can sell a few of these, but we have much better options.

I am not certain which Vesc is used in the Metroboard
[/quote]

I'm pretty sure it's a custom ESC designed by and made by Metroboard, with custom firmware, based on the VESC project.  If you've already purchased and received one of these, you could request a schematic and source code, but not designs or PCB files.  If you haven't purchased one, then they aren't obligated by law to assist you.

Damn you sound might salty there. I guess being a trampa Ambassador does that to you because I see you keep focusing on that they are using fake Trampa  hubs when they are actually the same hub Trampa  uses . And you keep comparing a board that not build for hardcore DIY guys like the people  in here since most of us can build a board  with much better spec i know that for a fact. Metro board does not cater to the DIY community but to the  average sk8 rider that does not have the time or the skill to build a board. And metro board is a very reliable board  with great customer service  And the spec and speed is more then enough for the average rider.

So don’t let your bias cloud your judgment I understanding all the point you made and you are right.

I had one too, check my post history if bored - yet the only bias here is stating that a new complete made up of entirely unknown components - including fake SuperStars - is as reliable as you state MetroBoards are, today. :slight_smile:

Edited to soften my tone; my sincere apologies. Please note I’m not here to discredit MB in any way - if @b264 says it’s good, I’ll buy it as I’ve convinced myself now that I “need” that CNC drivetrain (which I cannot find in Shenzhen, anywhere). 

What I will not do is buy their board, take it to China and have fakes made. :)

There's a very real chance that board is worth $2500.  I haven't seen it... but I've seen a lot of stuff that they've made, and they're pretty legit.

The only real downfall is their boards aren't waterproof -- but ***LOLZ*** because no boards are the way they come from the factory.  Even if they say they are.  And [especially](https://forum./t/riding-your-electric-skateboard-in-the-rain-is-a-really-dumb-idea/32/5?u=b264) the cheap china hub motor bullshit.

It seems like Metroboard is moving closer to a @longhairedboy  / Kaly / @psychotiller board and further away from things like Boosted / Arc / Evolve

People love their metros. I get emails in my support box all the time about people wanting to extend their life and swap components, etc. I have yet to get one into my shop though. The last guy wanted to know if i could swap out his remote for something different but since i haven't seen one and don't know if its a proprietary ESC/RX combo  i couldn't tell him. 

Brand culture is a very real thing now. Evolve, Metroboard, Boosted, all very different cultures. You can always tell when the DIYers are being born though because they start with one of these then start getting bored right away lol

This is true my first board was a metro board lol. But one of the reason I support there bran is cuz that board lasted me two years and those years the only issue I had was I killed 2 of the ESC and Ilan replace them free of charge even tho it was pass its warranty. I will be getting the metroX even tho My build kills it in every aspect. But it will be a nice board to mod

[/quote]
WRONG, NOT THE SAME! Something looking the same is not necessarily the same! 
Fakers want to trick you by making something of a lower spec, looking the same like the original high spec product. They can only sell on price point and in consequence need to cut back on quality. 
This can be anything from using low spec material, toxics in materials, lower resistance against corrosion, lower life expectancy etc.

We use a high spec material from a European, top of the range brand. It's injected on a sophisticated mould that extracts all and any air bubbles. Original Superstars are not made in China!

This is a fake, made from low spec plastics:

![non-genuine-materia_s|134x200](upload://uhzDCwlPWTzxz2vuVg1aEeZsuOQ.gif) 

It's a shame that companies offering a 2.5K product use fake parts to 
increase margins on the back of the safety of the users. 
Our team riders would shred those FAKES to pieces in one day.
The faking company hasn't done the R&D work and in consequence doesn't have the data required to make the part to proper standards. They can only copy what is visible!
Don't save on safety critical parts. If you end in hospital, blame yourself!

The car industry has similar problems with fake parts. 
Would you trust a car manufacturer selling a car with fake parts.

I wouldn’t suggest putting a video without knowing facts. In the car world I’ve seen people crack and break real TE37’s the same way someone cracks XXR or ROTA wheels. Can’t compare both. Everything and anything will and can break regardless of being real or fake. Now is quality better on the real wheel, yes as there is more finesse and detail to the real deal.

The AT wheels we are using on the MetroboardX are of high quality.  We found the supplier of these wheels on Alibaba, and based on our testing so far, we have had no major issues. Whether these are "Trampa Fakes" is not relevant (and your wheels are not patented). And if you have a problem with the supplier that is making them feel free to have this discussion with them.  We live in a free market economy and we have the right to offer whatever parts we can legally buy as long as they aren't patented. And bottom line we never compromise on quality regardless of price.

You are absolutley correct.  There are always going to be faster more powerful DIY boards out there, but at Metroboard we have to cater to the mass audience and build a board with specs that isn't going to kill the average rider.  Nonetheless we will offer additional wheel pulley sizes for those that want a higher top speed.  Also the MetroboardX is also about the carve and this is enabled by double pivot trucks.  These trucks are more prone to speed wobble so that is another limitation to how high of a top speed we can offer without risking the safety of our riders.

I especially like the deck.  I'm sure if you did a lacroix style deck only deal there would be a group buy within seconds.  Great way of promoting the brand.  

You really should introduce yourself though if you're here as a vendor.
