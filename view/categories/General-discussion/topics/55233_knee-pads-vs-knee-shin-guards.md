I'm hoping you guys can help me decide which pads I should buy for knee/leg protection. I've narrowed down my search to these two items due to their price and ability to put on and take off easily, but I can't decide which one would be better for esk8 applications. I feel like knee pads are tried and true for coming off the board in a somewhat controlled, straight-on situation where you can slide out a fall. But I feel like with Esk8, it's more likely that we get bucked or tossed off unexpectedly, and I see myself more likely to end up not just on my knees, but also on my shins, so maybe the knee/shin guards are a better choice? I'm curious to hear opinions and experience that you all may have.

I got the Triple 8 knee pads and those are really stiff and does not feel nice when riding. However they are great for falling and sliding on them. Can't say anything about the Fox guards.

I personally use knee/shin pads. It definitely protects more and you'll get that sense of security with it on versus the knee pads. There is no mobility restriction and I love the lock clips! You can put it on/take it off with ease.

I have these

And I agree with @SourPlumGoose. Actually feel more comfortable and easier to put on and off than regular knee pads.
