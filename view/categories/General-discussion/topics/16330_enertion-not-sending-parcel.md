That isint long. 90% of eSk8 building is waiting for parts. Enertion does seem to take a bit longer depending if the product is in stock or not, but 15 days is not long.

Jason runs this out of his garage. It's not hobbyking. The eSk8 industry itself is in the infant stages. Give it time, and if you really worried email support (they may or may not respond).
