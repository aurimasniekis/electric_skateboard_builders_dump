Hay guys I'm looking to make a independent braking system so I an use cheap esc's with my set up. Any ideas on how i can achieve this it has to be somewhat aesthetically appealing.

MBS offers a brake setup for mountainboards, but its wired. I think it'd be cool to hook up a service and some manual brakes for wireless but I haven't seen it done yet

trampa do [trucks & wheels with magura disk brakes](http://www.trampaboards.com/35-hs11-brake-board-c-366.html)...

and there is a thread that was posted a couple months ago where a guy hooked up a servo to the brake lever and controlled it from a modified mad munkey remote... I forget the name though :(

will cost more than just buying a decent esc though?

There’s also a company called break board that is pretty cool.. they’re a bit pricey but if all you want to do is brake and not electrify the board it would be a good option.
