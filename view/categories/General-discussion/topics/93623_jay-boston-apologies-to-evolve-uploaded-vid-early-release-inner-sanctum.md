At the end it only had about 1k views, I don't think the knock on his rep would have been worth such a pitiful amount of impressions.

He probably feels like a proper moron, bonus?

Did he go from like 12k subs to 40k overnight? His videos get the same amount of views.. 

I mean I usually don‚Äôt watch his shit cuz he has no idea what he‚Äôs talking about

Controversy makes people engage in conversation.  It's worth much more for Evolve to have it than not. Smart and premeditated.

If I'm not mistaken, this is his third apology video in the last 12 months. I think he means well, but man does he have a knack for stepping in it.

He's a clunge, not even a nice inny moist one, just a dried up one with no talent.

No such thing as bad publicity. I'm convinced this was intentional.

If this is the third apology video then this definitely was staged just to get people talking about it more. Otherwise no sane company would send him products early.

Given the factory tour in the back of it, would agree staged and probably with their consent 

All about clicks likes and shares. He‚Äôs so dweeby & unknowledgeable why do sponsors want him fronting them ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Yeah he went from like 15k subs to 48k subs because of a dead shark called rosie... no joke, the guy does anything to get attention. maybe the formaldehyde fumes are showing...

**WTF?!** 

I don't really see ANY reason why an apology is needed for this. The accidental release is just hours or ONE day too early. I mean what did they think was going to happen? Someone like Boosted sees the video and create a board with similar specs and manufacture it within a day which will make Evolve lose potential sales? If Jay really wanted to apologize, this situation is a "Shit, my bad" kinda apology. Not this video that looks like he killed a effing puppy. Grow a pair damn it.

There was absolutely no loss here especially since Jay is an Evolve fanboy and knows very little about what really makes a superior board. So the whole things would lead to sales.

In case you can't tell, I hate forced apologies. My parents always tried to push that on me because I am/was a blunt a-hole and told it like it is.

It's referred to as thunderclap marketing. Essentially you want all the hype to smash the internet at the same time so that people impulse buy like hell on release.

When people have time to discuss and examine together like during a leak it costs the company more revenue than you would think.

You know all this though Mike :smiley:

Exactly this Brent.

One of my friends did a review, hired a studio, recorded his video and everyone was supposed to release together and would have ridden the YouTube algorithm.

Instead Jay tried to fuck them, its that simple.  Still Evolve dont seem to bothered looking at their comment on his video.

Obviously I'm not a marketing professional so I don't know the potential loss. It's just my personal take on the matter. When it comes to product specs on these things, no one trust them anyway

The problem he has is being trusted for other announcements. Media people obey embargoes to maintain the confidence of their sources.

ask @sofu what she thinks about that leak. its more about fairness, timing for the reviewers than potential loss on evolves side.

@sofu the review popped up in my Google news feed this AM. I read the whole article and i thought you gave a real unbiased opinion of the GTR. I will not be buying one though. I am waiting patiently for @revel_flo to release their new drive system.
