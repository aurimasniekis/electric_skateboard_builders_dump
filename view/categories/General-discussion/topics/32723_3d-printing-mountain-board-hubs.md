Hi! I've tried to print some mountain wheel hubs for my evolve electric skateboard, and they work well and can handle my weight. But i dont have any exact measurements of mountain board hubs, since my evolve board is originally street version. 

Also i want to make the pulley for the evolve boards too! 
I can provide cheap   hubs and pulleys for the ones helping me. 

Thanks

why not just buy a single MBS rockstar hub for 15$ and do your scans off that?

The search button is a great tool... people have already done that and there is a file on this forum. I'm going to encourage you to find it - which should take about 10 seconds.

Sorry dude I have to call BS on this one...
I searched _3d printed hub_ and the thread came up as the first suggestion :unamused:
