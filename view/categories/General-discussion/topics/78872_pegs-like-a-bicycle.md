Do you think it's possible to have pegs on an esk8 for the occasional low range passenger to jump on?

Its probably very hard to control a board in tandem, if theyre an experienced rider straights should be ok, but turning would prove difficult.... 

You can always tow them :D

I wish. Been sober for 7 days. I just think it'd be dope if the homie needed a quick lift and jumped on my rear trucks somehow. Dat negativity doh. I don't think my post deserves your response. It's a sincere thought.

It'd have to be a hella strong truck but just thinking about it, I think it's doable

The load to the drive-train would be dramatic. You would need some space-grade trucks for sure..

Or at least adding a considerable amount of amperage to the motors to get you going, even if Its a dual setup :thinking:

You don't think it'd be like a motorcycle? Yes it's harder with a passenger but as long as they don't lean like a cholo, it's all good! :P

You do realize that the passenger won't be able to steer by leaning. He will just do melbourne shuffle, rip the trucks out from the deck by doing that mad twist and there you fly. :smiley:

No way its going to be like a motorcycle. Motorcycles work on counter steering, skateboards do not.

But go ahead and do it for science. Just make sure to wear a helmet, and a protective bubble for whoever is going to be the passenger. And then have the tools ready to just take them off.

I've never done it before, but I'm sure it would be easier when one riders mass is multiple times the others....

@squishy654  Is your daughter 100lb? :slight_smile: *just a joke*

We do get the idea of what you mean, but one would get better chances of riding in "tandem" by having the passenger on his shoulders or attached as a backpack. :smiley:

this works too. cut it shorter and have a carabiner at each end. bit cheaper and easier

Brought my wife home from the pub... only a mile, my board survived! She stood behind with her feet next to each other facing forward so that she didn’t resist my turns... 140kg all up weight on tb218’s

Come on mate, just a little light banter.  Please accept my humblest apologies for the trite and basically heartless comment to what will probably turn out to be the innovation of the year.

 You go for it girlfriend!

Single post with a flat spot extending out the rear. Just enough to rest the rear foot on.  Passenger front  foot in front of the rear truck and holding on to the front person.  Maby a screw in stud like the sword board has.

Why has no one yet mentioned the Quinny longboard stroller? It's perfect for this! Everyone laughs at your grown-ass friend in a baby seat, and you still get to look sort of cool.

Force caused ( ~1500N ) by a weight of two people ( ~150kg ) isn't all that huge.
People dancing on the boards put higher loads on the board / trucks.

Take a look at mountain bikes. These things are fucking strong and are rated only up to ~100kg.
That's because 100kg person jumping on a bike can easily put down forces magnitude higher than the force caused by the gravity ( F=m*10, where m is a mass in kg and 10 is rounded gravitational constant ).
So even if you put 3 people on such a bike and just cruise down the street, it will be fine.

Now back to the boards.
There will be a higher stress put on the drive train to achieve the same acceleration, of course.

Also, because you have to move a bigger mass, you need a bigger force = stronger magnetic field in the motor = more current = more heat in the motors & reduced range.

Trying to control the board while sharing it with someone is a different story.
Without any accessories, the only way I can think of would be to let the person jump onto your back and ride like that, although dealing with such a high center of mass would be interesting and your knees/back wouldn't be very happy either. Anything else I can think of requires really good coordination with the passenger.

I think that would be very hard to turn on due to standing so far to the back of the board with your feet so close together

According to the site's pictures you ride it sort of like a scooter and lean left or right, and the turning radius is comparable to your average longboard. That doesn't sound too bad to me.

Love to see you get that by the wife.  Excuse me darling just taking our precious 10 month old angel out for a skate.
Let me know how that works out for you.:rofl:

 A much better solution is to always carry around a penny board and tow your friend!

 I have a short piece of PVC  with a rope threaded through it tied to my backpack so when I am on campus and see someone else on a unpowered board I can give them a tow!

 Of course with how slow and short range most Chinese electric on boards on the market are, I should be giving those riders a tow too!
