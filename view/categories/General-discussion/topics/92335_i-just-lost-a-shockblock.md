Not sure if thats the name but i noticed that i lost one of my red shock blocks on the front. I loosened the truck so i can turn better but after a curve i noticed how loose it was., well thats because its gone.Now i'm trying to find it.

Okay...?  Are you asking if someone will sell/give you one or just telling us you dropped a piece of rubber on the road?

No i just lost mine 15 minutes ago and wanted to tell you./Ask if thats normal? It wasn't even as loose as i wanted it to be.

Gonna go with no, channel trucks should be able to handle more abuse than you get on a road since they are for rocks and shit

So my theory would be that if i have to loosen it to the point where it falls out, then the red ones aren't for me.

I think the yellows are the next softest?  But yeah, the shocks should always be firmly mounted and rely on the composition for tuning

Red>Orange>Yellow 
hard to soft

At 80kg I ride super loose yellow in front, tight yellow or orange at back

Another thing... I ride with bindings which gives me ALOT more leverage :p pretty sure I will be struggling with even yellow if i didn't have them

Mine popped out mid ride... Didn't even notice for quite a while...

Luckily I had spares at home.. I too loosened the truck a fair bit hoping to get more carve.

Two different types of errors.... One is mechanical and the other is user influenced

Hey @Andy87, is it possible to use shockblocks on trampa trucks? Nooby question I know.... üòÇüòÖ

I liked only what you wrote first. Will take away that like now üòå

Is there an instruction how to use the shock blocks? I could imagine they even not mend to be adjustable. Just get the right blocks for your turning radius and good.

I wanted jensos but the extra adjustability and cost isn't justifiable for me yet

Dick tape can fix that @Sn4pz

@Gaza65 interesting set up. Let us know how you like it.

I don‚Äôt have the trucks in front of me but aren‚Äôt the Matrix2 a bit lower than the trampa trucks?

Not sure Andy87.
I'm just waiting for my 6880 motors to come in... could be awhile 2 weeks probably be 4 weeks...
Jen's base plate is more snug on the orange rubber than the original metal base plate so..

I mean the Matrix2 base plate is shorter than the trampa base plate which would result in a lower profile or that your rear truck than will sit a bit deeper than the front. Might just be an optical thing and not true. Can‚Äôt check it on mine right now. Just a thought. And no hurry, just let us know when you tried it out.

User influenced because i did not know that they fall out thats easily. Or that even Red ones are to hard for my fat ass.

If they fall out its probably too loose.  I would go a color softer. @xsynatic bindings were game changing for me. It took a while to get used to but I don't ride without them anymore.   So much more control.

If any of you have a pair of red or orange shock blocks that you'd like to trade for a pair of yellow blocks, let me know. I've got the regular Matrix 2 trucks with yellows front and rear, and while it is plenty stable even with the yellows, I wouldn't mind stiffening the rear a little bit. I weigh a little less than 200lb/90kg all geared up and I feel like the yellow up front provides good medium /high speed 31+mph/50+kph stability along with maximum maneuverability without having to even tighten them much. The yellows in the rear are cracked down a decent amount though. I think the yellows in front coupled with oranges or reds in the rear (and a 5¬∞ dewedge) would be a good combination for many of us.

Want to just trade a pair of yellow for orange?
You should keep a pair of orange for your rear truck.

Interesting 

Haven‚Äôt driven the MBS trucks yet but I installed yellow in the front and orange in the rear with 5degree dewedge printed riser as a baseline to start with  :+1:

Just in case anyone is wondering, you don't NEED to run any shock blocks in front unless you're planning on going really fast. I'm trading a pair of rear yellow blocks for oranges, so yellow front /orange rear will be my normal setup soon. But in the mean time, I decided to try running NO blocks up front and yellows in the rear in the loosest position. Basically as floppy and loose as possible...for science.

Carving is a lot more like surfing with almost no resistance to lean, and super maneuverability. I'm testing slowly and carefully, in case this thing wants to kill me, and have only gotten up about 25mph, but so far, no speed wobbles with no blocks in front. It's a bit like riding a bike where it's easy to fall off just standing there, so you need a little speed to feel stable, but once you're moving, it's quite an interesting ride. It's amazing how wet noodle loose you can ride these trucks, and how fun it is to whip out sharp, controlled turns as if it was my little Spud board. :exploding_head:

True. The missing shockblock hasn't stopped me riding my board. 50km so far since i lost it.I regularly reach my top speed without problems. I still prefer both blocks but its definitely usable.
