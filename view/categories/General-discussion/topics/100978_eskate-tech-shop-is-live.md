Good luck with your sales!

Oh and i hope you can wash the titel „tech“ clear again. There have been several vendors with „tech“ in there name before. All have been very strange or scammed people.

I think you might be onto something..

There aren't many enclosures that you can get in different colours..

There's even the small thing inside the box :joy:
It struck me, I did that for my first build, it's a nice option but a little cheap

@EskateTech it's not bad for it to be a flower pot, but that's not what you expect on a 1200 euros eskate... (nor a single with a 10S3P if you're open to opinions :wink:)
