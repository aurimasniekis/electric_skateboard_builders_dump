They are the motors used in the new version koowheel! NO resistance so I can go a lot farther! The boards with all extras are only like $899 right now and I am selling this one with all the extras and custom theme for only $650... $250 off price tag and includes everything and the custom look!!! Includes waterproof bag specially made for this board and custom to match board and will be done tomorrow! Along with extra controller, grip tape, lights, etc

I sent a couple pictures to show the last custom koowheel I did to give you an idea of the level of work that goes just into the paint jobs and we use heavy duty epoxy on our boards to protect them and keep them lasting a lot longer looking nice and makes the job of keeping it clean as well as cleaning it much easier!!! Like glass!!!!! And we can offer choice of theme... and a  matching custom themed bag and a ton of extra stuff all for a fraction of the price of a koowheel and I am doing the custom painting for free on the boards until I can find a company that wants to pick me up, and would be willing to send me a board to custom paint for them as a concept theme for some boards or a special give away to someone after I am done designing the look like I did for the koowheel board just for fun! If a company is interested in me doing a board for them I will only ask for a board myself and then I would custom paint both boards and send the better one of the 2 back for promo or extra attention on the board! Because the boards after I finish literally get 1,000% more attention and even caught the eye of koowheel within a week after doing it without ever contacting them at all!!! And they found me and contacted me and asked me to email them about it and they absolutely loved it and asked for rights to pictures and videos which I agreed to and they put up a couple gigabytes of video some places online! If I can find a company interested I will do something really cool and unique with the board that will really get a lot of positive attention!!! If your company would be interested let me know and I would be interested in trying out a board and giving it a custom look and show it all on YouTube and or anywhere and everywhere else!!! So any company interested let me know before I lock in with whatever work for the summer!!!!

So basically its a koowheel board with a fancy paint job I wouldnâ€™t really consider that a real custom as it is many just a spray painted griptape. If you want to see truly custom boards look at my Instagram or some of the other custom builders on Instagram Bear Walker boards or Primate boards.

Yeah actually my boards can come with battery meters and 35-49 mile battery mods and this board has an upgraded bms in the battery and also we can offer them  on flexable drop through decks! The only build I am interested in are builds that have a higher speed and range but most boards on the planet do not go as fast or far and defiantly none under a grand!!!!but if you want different electronics or decks it is possible but would cost more than $499!!! Here is the board with a custom theme and yes I can call it that cuz is it not custom Transformers alien tech themed?  And the big tbing is the custom epoxy finish thst is a miracle like glass and can clean grip luke glass and still has grip!!!![1524724775177-1023138390|666x500](upload://wx0dyN2DrceNARPYNnVQCabSALb.jpg)

Do you work for the carvon team because if. So you can email me at christophermountsr@gmail.com
The next board I show within 30 days is going to blow these out of the water!!!! I need that long for some if the materials and it will be severly labor intensive but will be a deck that has never been seen before and something that will draw people in by the groups day or night!!!! This was just a practice board to build my patience for the next one! AS FAR as the grip looking to perfect... I am a tattoo artist by trade as well as a custom painter and engineer and over all visionist!!!

I have seen those automatic lights before all it is is a sensor that turns them on.  I think you guys need to work on your camera skills a little more because that video was juttery as hell. I wasnt trying to start a fight on here but I was just stating a fact it isnt really a custom board it is more of a modified board. if you are just taking a koowheel board and changing some things on it that is the definition of a modification.  Why dont you show off the internals of the board like batteries with vesc's and everything because that is what everyone is interested in

Where have you seen  automatic light kits? I have not heard one person say they exist out of hundreds and hundreds of people! You may have seen them from us because we started designing them last year and making prototypes and bets testing and the camera work was shot on my 10 year old sons old crappy phone while out testing and all other footage is on computer To be eddited before releasing it
