Last year, I grew really frustrated with my initial failure to build my own 10s4p battery for my Evolve CGT. Turns out that you should always check your voltage before linking up the wiring to your BMS!  After frying 2 BMS's and buying 2 replacements at exorbitant costs, I set out to find the manufacturer.

I located them, and after some emails, I was told that I would need to buy at least 600 units at $19.20 per unit in order to purchase the BMS from them, but I was able to talk it down to 300 units (**EDIT** - It is now 150; see below). Of course, I do not have $5,760 (now ~$2,800) to drop/invest in the BMS. 

So, I was wondering - is anyone interested in setting up a group purchase?

Man I applaude you for doing your homework and getting to the bottom of this. However, 300 orders is a tall order! I can help you with 1 or 2,  but that’s it, haha. The price still $20 a piece?

Wow wow wow :hushed: many thnx for your research! 
Are you really sure it is the correct bms? With correct firmware? If so I am willing to buy some.

Unpopular opinion. 300 units is not a group buy. 300 units is you setting up your own store and getting 300 pre-orders so you can fund your first stock purchase. You and 10 of your friends (people you know in person) ordering together to save shipping and getting a small discount is a group buy.

I'm assuming that what you want is one BMS and you want to pay $20+shipping for it. The idea that organising an order of 300, collecting the money and shipping 300 units around the world is going to save you money is crazy. Think of the logistics and time that will take you!

Yup it is still $20; I asked them if there were any price drops recently, if Evolve was indeed going to upgrade to have a BMS that was hardware-locked to the ESC. However, it's too big of an order for me, possibly too big for this whole forum lol. I wouldn't mind forking over $200 to buy 10 or so but even then I cannot imagine multiple people dropping that kind of money unless they also wanted to sell batteries.

@pjotr47 Yes it is the correct BMS as far as I know; I was able to purchase 10 as a "test purchase" and all of them functioned perfectly, showing 0 charge cycles upon startup. I currently am running 2 on my boards w/one as a spare, and either sold the other BMS's to recoup the cost of the purchase or installed/sold them with my own batteries at the time. On a tangent, I was also able to acquire the unique quick-connector (connecting the wiring from the batt. to the bms) used by the manufacturer, some of which I still have. 

@AlexBE I would not mind having 10-20 units, as I can make batteries and sell them locally. However, the logistics/time is a major concern - that is partly why I made this post, to see if anyone had any ideas on how to make this work, if at all lol. 

@moon Yeah, I'm hoping that there is a way to figure things out. It really depends on how many units people here would want overall, but at best I can only imagine 50 being wanted in the whole forum. If any Evolve battery sellers were interested in this purchase, that may help, since they could speed up their production time - and only charge $20 or so to cover the costs per BMS.

Out of the 2 dozen battery mods we have done majority were done using the Evolve BMS (existing), and some with complete upgrades resulting in me have a few evolve bms units for sale. (sold) If it wasn't locked into Evolve system and could be used in DIY builds we would be interested. Unfortunately, with it being locked to the evolve controller, it doesn't open up much for DIY

Sign me up - I'll PM you if you don't mind, don't want to get the thread going on this tangent. I guess I should've checked this site while on vacation, can't believe I missed your post about these remotes.

But this brings up an excellent point. I think only those interested in the Evolve BMS would want one for a battery upgrade, or selling upgrades. And why bother when you can just get this remote, along with Any DiY guy would prefer the Maytech remote since you can use it more easily with your own build.

waterproof remote can show 3-14s battery voltage if connect the receiver to BATT+.

The customer can adjust “2. Batt” (3.2V/S or 3.7V/S) and “3. Batt. Num” (1-14s) according to their battery.

And because the battery voltage indicator has 10% tolerance. So it’s better to set batt number 1S less than actual battery S. (For example, if your battery is 3.7V, 6S, it’s better to set remote Batt.Num to 5.)

Because manufacturers can't be bothered dealing with small fry consumers, it's just not worth it to them. They want to sell volume on the wholesale market. It is a completely different ballgame having to deal with thousands of customers who order 1 unit each vs 10 customers who order 10000 each.

This is one of the reasons Enertion struggles at times. They are trying to both manufacture and retail at the same time.

That is something I really want! I will send you a pm about it. 

At this moment I am working on battery like hobby. But if my goverment (Belgium) accept a new law about starting a business. I can start taking much bigger orders. Also for a smaller price because I will start to buy in bulk. I was also thinking off buying a cnc welder so I can speed up my buildtime. I want that everybody in the EU can buy a better pack then Chinees ones for almost the same price. + faster shipping then China :slight_smile: 

If the new law is accepted, I was thinking of starting a small kick start project. I like Samsung 30q so all packs would have that. I was thinking off 10s3p (single layer cells), 10s4p (single or dual layer cells), 12s4p (single or dual layer cells) with a 60-80A bms with e switch. 
If there is interest in such a kick start project and I can start my own business (at this moment it cost me 18500 euro to start a business, that is excluding notary costs & insurance & materials)
With the new law I have the possibility to start a company for 5000 euro that is excluding notary costs & insurance & materials. 

if I have the opportunity to reduce costs through a kickstart project, I will definitely do that.

If that BMS is working good I am maybe willing to add also a evolve upgrade pack to the kickstart list.

This needs to happen but i don't have $5K for evolve BMSs either, and you still have to machine the decks for all of the bamboos, even the GTX. Like others are saying, this is well beyond group buy territory. 

I could maybe buy 20 of them. 

My advice would be to either find somebody with $5K and set up shop with him/her or do a preorder and risk not reaching your funding goal.

Hey guys,


Kit: Great work finding them!


Might I bring up some discussion:

Evolve physical Bluetooth module looks consistent with other generic Bluetooth BMS. The style and features look similar as well. 

However software could be read differently by the remote and perhaps to ESC as well. 

Best to request a sample of one 1st (they'll request DHL /UPS account). Good to verify if they're compatible. 

If so sign me up for 50x.

If you wish not to initiate the group buy, I can. I have funds. Redistribution shipping will be a nightmare if everyone only wishes to buy 1 or 2.

However I greatly urge to get a sample first test, very common practice.

I have already purchased 10 last year as a test purchase, delivered via DHL; I currently am running 3 BMS in my own built batteries, which properly connect to my R2. The software is the correct one, though I do not know if Evolve made any major changes recently since then. 

I have also built/sold 3 batteries to some friends as well; one of them uses his board daily to ride to work, about 15 miles, over the last year. 

As far as I can tell, these are the legit BMS devices used by Evolve. 

If this does gain traction, so far:

Me - 10 or 20
@longhairedboy - 20
@Stutter.gram - 50
@pjotr47 - 1/2 so far
@Jaydawg56 - 1/2   


I do have funds to initiate a buy but it is quite a steep price for one person. I would like to ensure that everything is worked out regarding logistics and redistribution. We could do the bulk buys for people in our areas, or for a personal battery building business, in order to reduce the logistics issue; I am in SoCal, lhb is in Floridaland, and @pjotr47 is in Belgium. If we could get 50 units to regional battery-modders, it might make this more doable. 

If we ask enough people in each area, on or off the forum, who confirm they would like a battery with the BMS pre-built in, then we can more easily determine how many BMS's should be sent to each of us for our areas.

Considering that this is a somewhat highly-sought after item, I would also most likely need to figure out how much to charge for the time/effort made to locate the manufacturer, make the purchase, and re-ship the items to each major builder/area.

It sounds like you are more sensible than I first thought. I bet that once you factor everything else in, you will end up selling the BMS for the same price that Evolve does. Even then it will not be worth your time. How are you going to handle

* Warranty
* Lost in shipping (expect to lose 2-5%)
* customs
* payment processing fees

The list goes on.

He can get to 100 pieces easily, with about 6 people.

And $120 is probably what they are worth, so he can literally add $5 per bms to cover time/fuckups and be sitting comfortable with $500

Thanks for the compliment....


I do not believe I will be able to provide warranty. I am not exactly a business owner. However, I can see about ensuring that each product sent out is confirmed to be working with a video recording sent to the buyer. If it fails upon startup after delivery for some reason, I could consider replacing it. But if it stops working in 6 months, that is another story.  

If it is lost in shipping, it depends on the shipping service. I assume insurance can be purchased, or if the buyer can provide email proof of sorts to prove it was lost in shipping, we can work on sending a replacement at discount. I wouldn't exactly be responsible for the shipping service not being able to ship a product, but I think I can provide an option to purchase shipping insurance if it is a concern for buyers.

Customs - I would like to reduce the chance of an issue occurring by shipping the BMS's in bulk to a single regional battery modder who can then offer to sell the BMS to the buyer. 

Processing fees - like, my price for handling all of this? If this gains traction, I would have to determine the cost.

## \#42 Posted by: Kit Posted at: 2019-01-23T23:42:46.690Z Reads: 187

People are willing to buy these at $120-$100 each. But even so, that price is too much imo. If I obtain these, I would intend to sell them retail at the Evolve price of $60 each. For those who contribute to purchase a certain amount at the bulk , the price would likely be $20 with some processing fees on my end. I personally intend to profit off of the processing, but mainly from selling the 20 or so that I intend to purchase for myself. 

The rest of the units that were bought in bulk by regional modders, can be sold by them again at the $60 price. What do you guys think about that though? 

TBH things like this is why I posted this to the group - to see how feasible these prices would be to everyone, for such a large purchase.

It is plug and play, and the firmware works with the evolve ESC. if @Stutter.gram is able to get any units from them, we might be able to buy them at a more manageable number as well. Although, it looks different from the Evolve BMS? I can't say for certain, but the wiring looks different. We will have to test one to be certain.

I just got a response from the manufacturer as well - I am able to make a purchase at 150 units as of now. 

However, thanks to @Stutter.gram, we also have the site they use (I could never find it lol - I just found the email of a salesperson, after finding a number). It provides the emails for several sales associates. I believe we can order from them directly, instead of dealing with the hassle of doing a group buy. I have sent an email with the link that @Stutter.gram used, inquiring if a purchase of 5 can be made. 

While I tested the BMS last year & confirmed that it works with the Evolve ESC and R2, I cannot say if the same works with this batch, although I am confident it will. I will update the thread if I can get an order of 5 - or more - going instead. This would be much better than a group buy imo.

Although, the picture in the link does not match the evolve controller exactly - the wiring looks different? Anyone able to make a comparison, if they have a BMS lying around?

So the ones evolve uses are not on the website. Has to be a special inquiry. I found this site a long while ago but for some reason I did not pursue them due to it not being listed (silly me).

I'm curious to get the datasheets and see other options they list. Even though the ESC is the weak part of the board, the BMS can definitely be better.

Ok, I think we are still looking better than before though - my contact informed me that we can certainly make the purchase, by the CNY will delay the delivery until mid March. 150 units can be purchased though. We have almost 100 here, and I can vouch for their usability.

Based on the unit price of my last order, 150 units x 19.20 will make the price about $2880. With DHL, it was $70 shipping. 

Currently, we have just under 100 units requested though - including your 50.

Just allow for more current to the ESC. ESC has a switching FET that's limited to 65A per data sheet. I've fixed a few ESC with this burnt. 

Evolve has designed tolerances so close to each other which is not a reliable nor a common practice in Industry.

To think of it, it makes sense why the notorious evolve cut off of death happens. This may be due to the Continuous use of over 24 amps triggering the BMS to suddenly cut off power. Of course this is during continuous High load such as high speed going up hills. 

Moving to a higher power BMS might stop the random cut offs from the boards however if the ESC is not intelligent enough to manage current this could result in more frequent burning of ESC.

I'm still committed to buy with you Kit and Marsen. I've been in contact with the manufacturer but they're extremely difficult to communicate with. 

The Evolve BMS is only 24A constant 65A for 10 seconds .. could be why people are seeing the random cutoff. So I've been trying to get a larger model with the same telemetry.

Trying to organize an order has been even more of a hassle with them.

The current rating is due to the crappy mosfets they use. I have been using infineon power mosfets on another Chinese BMS thereby upgrading them by 70%. The Evolve BMS with 4 infineon mosfets on would be upgraded to 40A continuous. You can even double mount them and get 8 on there. I would have to test the double mount incase the mosfet driver wasn't up to scratch for 8, the infineon mosfets would require less power to switch them so it would most likely work.

From what I remember (it's been a while) the spec sheet of A09 BMS FETs are 64A continuous at 100C. They have 4x in parallel for discharge and 1 for charge. All heatsinked, so they should be fine. The limit is controlled by BJTs to open when too high of a sense voltage comes off the shunts. Have you looked into this?
```

## \#96 Posted by: Marsen Posted at: 2019-04-21T05:00:54.263Z Reads: 136

MOSFET ratings are a bit misleading. They are interrelated and cannot be considered separately. ie it cannot do 64A at 80V which is the Id and Vds limits of the Evolve one.  The infineon ones I use are rated 195A and 150V but you can't pump 195A through at 150V's. The VDS is the breakdown voltage so should not be exceeded. I wont go into what all the parameters mean on mosfet datasheets, one it's boring, two I don't know what half of it means anyway. :):thinking: There is a whole bunch of other things to consider such as the current path on the pcb tracks, big BMS's have copper buss bars soldered on them. You also have to have good heat sinks for heat dissipation. The RU8590R mosfets on my Evolve bms are not really crappy and I was over zealous in my slating of them but they are certainly not the best you could use as they are still cheap chinese mosfets. The existing design of the Evolve bms is very limited for high current applications because it is so compact but there are ways to improve this. The main problem I see is that using it in it's original setup is fine but when you couple it to a high power high capacity battery then there is risk of pushing it past it's limits. The Evolve battery is almost a regulator in that the battery sags and drains before you cause any damage to the BMS. A 10S5P battery can keep supplying high current at full voltage for much longer and you can push the electronic components to stress levels that will lead to premature failure.

![Copper%20buss%20bars|216x352](upload://iMDS67bCvsszFD5cB1vncd9wAou.png) 
This BMS has extra copper and large terminal area. It still has plenty of scope for improvements as the copper is short and not soldered very well.

![evolve%20bms|324x218](upload://oFFKwAWyFxEsK5x9C7meQpAzvgw.png) 
The Evolve one is small and compact and has a small terminal area.
Having a number of these BMS's wold give me the opportunity to test them out with better MOSFET's and see what they can safely handle.
![SOA|591x499](upload://lHlcPAL50JAjWuYxurXLe5pJi4E.png) 

This is the SOA, safe operating area of the Evolve mosfet. You can see at 36V it is only rated to 6A (if that) and peak current of 60A is at 2V.

Sorry for my delayed replies, I have been dealing with a family emergency. If we can determine how many BMS's are still desired here I can send another email out to my contact.

Originally that was at 600 units, but now its more like 125.

I will coordinate logistics & figure out payment with Pjotr. I can handle US shipping and he can handle EU (?) shipping. I have to find out if I can split the shipping locations with the manufacturer - I already informed him that I expect to purchase ~160-170 or more units in the near future. 

AUS may be a bit more tricky to be honest. We will need to figure out where to ship to if the manufacturer is fine with splitting the shipment. Just note that the price for shipping to each group (US, EU, AUS) may go up a bit since they will essentially be 3 separate shipments.

I should add - I can also have the manufacturer provide everyone with their BMS's unique male connector (pre-wired). So, no one will have to modify their original BMS wiring to connect a battery to the new BMS - instead, you will only need to splice in some wiring to the wires on the male connector.

You may need the plugs still. The one that the manufacturer uses is quite unique - the closest I could find outside of the factory are the JST2.0 plugs, but they still don't fit. If I can, I will include them anyways in order to avoid possible problems. 

I am chatting with pjotr to set up a google form and eventually a PayPal pool for everyone to list their orders. 

Once the form is filled, we will add the total cost of the units to each person, and then later, the cost of shipping and the cost of logistics for those who are handling the group buy per region. @pjotr47 and @Marsen, we can discuss that once we determine the total number of units that will be purchased.

It is $19.20 per unit, firm pricing. The manufacturer originally wanted 600 units ordered - it took a year to bring it down to 125, and now at 165 due to the unexpected demand. And note that that does not include the price of shipping to one of the distributers (me, pjotr, and marsen) as well as the secondary price of shipping and cost of logistics for each individual purchase.

No worries, there’s just been mixed posts about it also being closer to $15 earlier and no firm updates about this going ahead so was happy to fulfil the 150 minimum requirement by going halves with Marsen directly since we’re both in Australia.

I been trying to chat with @pjotr47 but he's been quite busy with University exams. @Marsen mentioned that he was contacting the AUS buyers - @Marsen any updates on that?  

It's a [simple form](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lsZJnzO3oUeJq5Yq_0H1jbD1zgL6bmwEPgu9_FLrXSo/edit?usp=sharing), requiring just your forum name, units desired, general location (US, EU, AUS) & paypal email. Anyone here can use the link above to edit their information. But please note, this is not the final price of the BMS.

The biggest constraint is my need to discuss how we will ship everything in an attempt to lower the cost....I am not exactly comfortable with opening up for everyones orders when I do not know what the price of shipping & logistics is going to be. But in order to find out what the best option is, I have just emailed the manufacturer if we can ship these items to the 3 of us distributors, then to everyone else in an attempt to lower the overall cost of shipping. 

Once I have the solid info on what the final price will be, we can get that pool going and make the order. This is why I am taking some time - while the sheet says that the price of the BMS is $19.20, what is the price of shipping to me/pjotr/marsen, then to everyone else? This will be quite a bit of work, should we split the cost of logistics amongst the 3 of us, based on the amount of units purchased per region? Since I am not a level 3 on the forums here, I am really leaning on the other two to provide their insight on that matter. I have not done this before, and want to get it right.

I've updated the form for myself. Don't be shy guys we need to get this moving so some commitment on numbers would be good. With shipping the price could easily go to $30 to get to each zone. I will have to pay customs and gst in Australia so that will add to the total plus customs forms of about $80. For the Australian guys I would expect the total to be between $40 and $45 Australian dollars after the exchange rate, which is crap for us at the moment. This is going on experience importing goods from China which I do regularly. It is better to expect a higher price rather than get a shock when it arrives in the country. @TinnieSinker @Pokwer  any thoughts on price expectation after freight, exchange rate and customs.

I´m interested too as i´m doing a lot of Evolve stuff recently.
Wouldn´t they be able to supply us with a stronger BMS? I´m not aiming big, but 40-60A would be awesome and would bring the upgrade game with a 10s4p to a new level.
Also it says RS232 communication. I found that on other bms description too. Is this something generell or does it need a special firmware to work with the Evolve ESC?

DIY is not just about building boards, it also means upgrades. The Evolve ESC only works with this BMS so upgrading the BMS MOSFETS is not a bad option as it only has a 25 amp rating. Changing the ESC and BMS is an expensive option for some.

In other words, does it mean that it can be used only with the ESC and remote control that shift to eco mode at 35V? It does not seem to be a big advantage to use with a large battery pack that uses 18650, 10S5P cells or more, or 21700 cells. I want to set the lower limit of GT mode to 34V. This is a personal concern of the 18650 battery upgrade at EVOLVE.

Well, if they reduce size and improve the specs that is good. 
Actually if the PCB get's narrower so 18650 can be used without any mod that would be perfect. (just dreaming here)

Now it needs is to be compatible in protocol with the Evolve controller if not is useless.

That doesn't surprise me, if they are still supplying Evolve they couldn't sell them to us. Changing the electrical performance will mean a bigger pcb. Putting better mosfets on will hike up prices and possibly a larger minimum order. I vote for just changing the pcb size and No. and anyone wanting to upgrade change there own mosfets.

I am fine with that, but they want to know what PCB size, charge, and discharge current we need - then the quantity for the order.

I have no idea what we need, and am unwilling to make a choice based off of my own opinion if that isn't what others want. Can everyone toss some suggestions my way?

I also plan on limiting the order to a sample size, so we can be certain this new BMS will be compatible.

## \#168 Posted by: Pokwer Posted at: 2019-07-02T03:17:24.436Z Reads: 78

Evolve's BMS quite happily takes 7A (I've confirmed this with one of Tinnie's 10S5P packs) while charging even though Evolve's biggest charger is only 4A. There's also no point changing the discharge amps since the motor controller has its own limits and won't draw anymore than what the original bms could supply anyway? After a battery upgrade like this it's always the motor controller / esc that potentially dies, I wouldn't up the output values just in case the evolve motor controller doesn't have its own internal limits and relies on the bms being the limiting factor? It'd result in more motor controllers being damaged.

Ok I finally got a reply from the manufacturer. They can make an esk8-S10-24A model BMS while keeping the mosfets the same in order to prevent any issues with the mosfet driver. This will increase the length of the PCB by 2mm as well. 

However, they would like for me to order 200 units.

If you wire the battery up to the motor controller and passthrough the actual volts of the pack it’ll blow the lower motor controller.

The Evolve BMS also regulates voltage to the motor controller and has a power switch pass through which adjusts the volts when off and on.

The price per unit remains $19.20! I am coordinating with the other 2 who are assisting, in order to PM everyone in order to confirm their order/obtain paypal info/confirm peoples regional locations. 

We have the US, EU, and AUS covered. The shipment costs will be calculated once we finish PM'ing everyone and inform the manufacturer how many units are going where.

*If you are outside of these regions and want a BMS, you will have to order from someone in one of these regions - and possibly pay extra for the longer-distance shipping.*











Reminder - these will not be tallied at a final price of $19.20. Shipping to each regions will be added to the cost of the BMS's, with the cost baked into the unit price (for me, it cost $70 to ship 10 units to my place in CA, US). Each region may differ, due to different costs of shipping. Shipping to a buyer will need to have costs included as well. And of course, payment for any work being done to distribute these units.


The final prices will be listed after confirming everyone's orders - one final follow-up will be made to each buyer after these prices are determined, so that we do not pre-maturely order from the manufacturer only to find that people have backed out. 

If I have left anything out, let me know and I will try to answer as best I can - I've come down with a cold for the last week and am running low on PTO, so I've been kinda burnt-out. But now that the manufacturer has responded again after 3 weeks of waiting, I want to get things moving as originally planned.

Hi!

Thanks Kit for organizing the group buy. Registered just for this, I think it's very unorthodox for Evolve to not sell these parts to their customers when needed.

I am heading off to work atm, but I plan on PMing the EU group today for direct confirmation as well - not for any PayPal emails though, at least not just yet. @pjotr47 will be the EU distributor, if he can confirm that on his end.

I will have to check & see, I'll ask when I submit an order amount for a quote. @pjotr47, is every EU member on the BMS sheet confirmed with you?

@Teeroy1 

You can provide the PayPal when we confirm  the order, which we will do after we receive the quote & confirm again that shipping to the US, EU & AUS distributors (me, @pjotr47 & @Marsen) on top of that is ok price-wise for everyone.

I am waiting for an update from @pjotr47 for the EU buyers - that being said, the BMS sheet doesn't show any changes. Any EU buyers here able to confirm their orders on the spreadsheet? I just need to submit the final order tally to the manufacturer & we can get the quote. Then we can see what shipment would be from each regional distributor to the individual buyers.

Ok guys, I've re-calculated the total amount of units to be purchased & it's at 264 units. I have gotten the 3 initial addresses (mine included) for a quote and have submitted the number of units requested per region. 

It should be received/replied to quickly at this hour. I will keep everyone posted. 

@Rod12579, your post on the spreadsheet does not indicate your location & has not been included in the quote. Please update your information as soon as possible so that your order can be included.

Here is the shipping cost to each region:

![image|690x198](upload://duFygFCJ15ViHpiDifiYdvlzWEV.png) 

I will also need to have the cost of shipping to each individual calculated, as well as including a labor cost per order. Shipping will cause the prices at this point to very per person; I'll confirm the final prices with each person before the final order.

Gotcha - aside from me being lazy (which is true) there were several causes to the delay, which I find understandable if not frustrating. For example:

* Being informed that a LVL 3 member needed to manage any group buy on the forums. I gave up on the thread until a couple of members volunteered to join the project. 

*  Members informing me in the thread that they contacted the manufacturer and were inquiring about purchases - I stopped things on my end, thinking that if people can buy directly, all the better. 

* Learning from the manufacturer that they will not sell a large quantity of the Evolve BMS - but that a slight alteration to the design is allowed, which would still work with the Evolve ESC. This took time to see what features we wanted to add-in; this delay was exacerbated by the fact that most members are based in the US, EU, and AUS, causing communication delays.

To be honest, the group buy didn't gain traction until April, while I was transitioning to a new job in IT. My laziness factors in here, as I started a salary position, which takes up time since employees feel the need to call IT at terrible hours. So after a day + some night hours working, I felt more inclined to smoke say, weed, than following up with my messages for order confirmations, address gathering, the whole 9 yards.

So lets start off by saying my evolve stuff is dead. I have replaced everything with aftermarket parts and much happier.

I broke my boards by pulling them apart and putting them together too many times and a few of the pins started to become loose, after re-soldering the first few I thought best just to chuck the thing because this is family time I cannot get back. 

How I got my board to switch from ECO,Fast,GT without a BMS.
I firstly noticed that if you are quick enough off the mark to change settings and get moving it would stay in that mode until you let off the throttle.
I managed to send a pulsed 5v signal to the UART port using an ardiuno nano every 9 seconds. 
this kept my board alive and staying in the selected mode. (im sure its not the best way to do it and I wish I had a video of it before I broke it but it can be done) you will get no battery information except the voltage, no individual cell info.

I used no BMS during testing and then went to a bigger BMS (aftermarket) and still had it switching, if I did it again I would be a little more gentle with the evolve ESC

Hey buddy, really appreciate all the effort you’ve put into this so far but since I’m no longer in the now prev gen ecosystem I’m no longer needing the bms’s.

Thanks for all the info you provided and for being so candid showing us your interactions with the manufacturer.

Hopefully it eventuates, it’s a great deal for anyone needing them. 👍

I really only need phone numbers from the other 2 distributors for shipping purposes.  The manufacturer will not budge from this request, so I seem to be stuck between a rock and a hard place.

Tbh,providing numbers does not commit us all to a purchase. Although I wonder why a phone number is necessary for a preliminary invoice. I've toyed with the idea of fake numbers, although I'd rather not do that since this would be a purchase we should keep track on during shipping.

Hi Guys, I apologise for dropping out of my order of 75 units. I can go for 10 units as spares but I have designed my own setup for upgrading Evolve boards which moves away from the old dated Evolve electronics. This was always my plan and was happy to go with the Evolve BMS for the short term, however this group buy started in Jan and so I have moved on with my design. Sorry but this has taken too long. @TinnieSinker @Pokwer @Kram720  can either of you guys take over distribution or increase your buy?

@Marsen I'm in the same boat actually. I'm also working on an enclosure for evolve boards to fit a bigger battery and vesc so my need for this bms has diminished a bit.

would still take a few if it goes ahead and can take over if need be
