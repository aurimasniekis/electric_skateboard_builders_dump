Just a general question for all the amazing builders out here. When you finished the board and configurated it the way you like, how often do you guys really go out on it? And do people use them for their daily commutes? I want to know this because I'm really looking into buying / building an electric skateboard :slight_smile:

[poll public=true]
* 0-10 miles / 0-16 KM per week
* 10-20 miles/ 16-30 KM per week
* 20-49 miles / 30-80 KM per week
* 50-99 miles / 80- 160 KM per week
* 100+ miles / 160+ KM per week
[/poll]

If esk8 would be legal in Germany, my board would already have replaced my bike for my commute to work just because i enjoy riding it so much. These days i take a ride on bikelanes almost every evening, my motorcycle stays in the garage :slight_smile:

Whenever the weather is clear enough & I feel like it. Also go to & from work often. 40 minutes there & 30 back. Use it when flying RC too. Basically all the time.

2.5 miles each way to work everyday for over a year, plus 5 miles each way for groceries twice a week, plus at least one full drain (12 miles) for fun on the weekends. Im starting to feel naked and hollow when i dont have it with me.

Maybe add a poll to the first post? I esk8 once a week usually on the weekend. It is just a fun ride because I don't really need to commute anywhere (still at school).

Im running my board about 100-150km per week! 20km daily commute and food shopping, 1-2 tours per weekend. if the weather is dry, I do everything with my board! :heart_eyes:

... pretty much since 2 years now actually! :no_mouth:

Im absolutely amazed how well regular wheels hold up with constant really hard carving. back then I started with evolve all terrain and had to swap tyres every 3 weeks! :tired_face:

I was residing in Copenhagen. The bike lanes are perfect for an e-board there. I have been driving me 3D Printed Spine up to 20km a day, and I was comfortable driving it at over 40km/h. It daily saved me about 2 hours on commuting. I was even driving it in rain, though at a huge, being wet price. 

Now that I moved to Berlin, where the boards seem to be illegal, I drive in the weekends. I take my Hyperboard to Tempelhof (closed down airport that is accessible to the public). It's a blast but it sucks that I can't do it more often.

Not a builder personally, but I have a board from @longhairedboy. I ride 3-5 days a week with a 7 mile commute (14 round trip). Sometimes I take the train in the morning so I don't get sweaty before work and ride home.  

Riding is a great way to decompress after work, it's like a little vacation.

weather good: every day to and from work. sometimes a spin in the evening when after my son is asleep.
weather bad: use the bike.
weekends: 30-40 min runs around my streets or short sunday morning "normal" downhill runs on my Lush so i can get better at sliding. when i build a faster board, will be speed runs!

when i don't have electric, then it's push ;-)

I use mine as much as possible.  Runs to the post (mail) office, to and from town (no fuel usage, no parking fee) and then I head to the South coast here in the UK (about a 40-min drive) for hour-long rides and top-speed blasts :smiley:

Every night, sometimes during the day, weather permitting.  I have a Home Depot near where i live and usually start my night ride there so i can blast as much as i want and not have to worry about cars or people getting in the way.  Then a leisurely ride around the neighborhood.  On some days it's the most fun i have all day.  It really is a little getaway from everything, really clears your head.

if you click on the gear logo, one of the options is "Build Poll".

I think the best measurement is miles per week. So like...

- 0-19 miles per week
- 20-49 miles per week
- 50-99 miles per week
- 100+ miles per week

When the weather is good enough to ride, I use it to commute, but I don't always go into the office and I often take the subway home. The ride to work is roughly 8 miles. Add on trips to the market, riding to my kids' school, meetings and all the other little rides. So it probably comes out to somewhere around 40 - 50 miles a week.

@ThomasRBK about about 20 miles a week. Two commutes at 3.5 miles per leg, and then "riding" just for fun. If the weather allows and I have time, I go out for more. Riding clears my head. 

@whitepony this is my life right now! only it's every 120 miles or so.

Ya gotta build Esk8 into your lifestyle so it saves you time. 

I went to a meeting yesterday that was about a mile away. Too close for a subway ride, but a 15min walk. Did the round trip in 5min. That saved me 25min. 

I can do a trip to the market to pick up anything I can fit in a backpack with 5min of travel time. By car, when you factor in getting in the car, parking or getting stuck at a light, it actually takes more than three times as long. If I skate, I'm back at home before I would have stepped foot in the market if I drove.

There are many times where I've added a hour or two to my day by skating.

I've saved 30 mins on my daily commute with a board. Gives me another 30 mins with my son, or means I eat before 8:30... So making it a part of my life has been positive on those three counts alone! ;-) 

now, if you add an enjoyment factor....

Every little bit makes a difference. If you start adding all the little bits of time here and there, it can come out to be a lot of time. 30min saved each day adds up to another work week. Skating gives me enough exta time to hit the gym almost daily.

Got my build running last Friday and I've put about 50 miles on. I'm loving the board. My commute is 2.2 miles and I made it door to door in 9 minutes today. I can take a bike path with about 300ft of sidewalk riding to get there. 

I took it on roads at night in very light traffic with my 300 lumen bike light taped to the truck and flashing lights on my back. Cars don't know what to make of you. I was honked at multiple times despite being totally safe and riding as a bike should. Be very very defensive around cars and pedestrians

Hey folks! I hope this will not cause a rage. 

We happened to have developed a survey to try an learn how people commute in cities. I thought it would be cool to post it here and see if people will be willing to share and learn from the empirical data.

I made the responses available for everybody who submits responses (let me know if it does not work).

Please don't compromise the answers just to get to see the results. 

So here's the link: https://goo.gl/forms/kCILnEQuZfctfPPx2 

Disclaimer: This survey was developed for our internal purposes so some questions are no 100% relevant to this topic. 

Cheers!

EDIT 1: This survey is a copy of our in house one and the results are not merged.
