EDIT: Solved with some work see 5th post

Any one know where to get a motor pulley 12mm width 10mm bore 12-16 Teeth, preferably with a key way?

Alien has 10mm bore but only 9 and 15mm wide
I have a tight space otherwise I'd just use the 15mm wide one from them

I also have tried boring out an 8mm pulley but the key way pulls the drill bit off center (even on a drill press)

Well I couldn't find anything. So I tried 2 different approaches.

1. I drilled out a 8mm bore pulley going only .4mm a pass so 8.4, 8.8, 9.2. 9.6, 10, 10.2
this worked much better than trying to start sight off with a 10mm bit, not perfect but usable. I drilled out.2mm more to get it to fit easier on the 10mm motor shaft. and I had to file the keyway back in.

2. Removed one flange and ground down the the 15mm wide 10mm bore Alien  pulley to 12mm
since I don't need the flange for my project (the wheel pulley has them)
This worked out great.
