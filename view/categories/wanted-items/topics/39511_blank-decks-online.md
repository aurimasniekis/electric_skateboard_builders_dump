Anyone give me some advice on where I can buy decent blank decks from? Kind of looking for an (around) 38-40" pintail design. Just for commuting, nothing serious.

Was looking at https://www.warehouseskateboards.com and http://www.skateshred.com but having just bought a deck unseen from the net I am sure that there are good and bad decks.

Going to be my ultimate e-sk8 deck so I don't think I want too much flex (having not ridden a flexi-board yet). I'm about 70kg.

One of my friends has bought a deck from skate shred, Its not bad quality. Im sure it will break faster than a $100 sector 9 deck, but its a good deal if you are just starting out.
