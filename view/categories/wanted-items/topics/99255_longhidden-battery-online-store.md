Hey!
I was wondering if longhidden online store is legit. They sell li ion battery packs for a good prize. If so, does anyone know how to contact them? Their mail adress dos not work.

Then I can't call it legit if they messed up that simple part. No high hopes then.

Maybe I'm to quick to judge but anyway I have never heard of em

hey guys,

there email address is:
longhiddenusa@gmail.com

They have a professional battery making factory in china that makes batteries to order.
Normal turn around for the shop is about 4 weeks with shipping.

Here are some pictures of a 12s4p that my friend took apart to get it to fit into a custom enclosure.

FULL DISCLOSURE: I am helping them with some support, and have not been paid.

Those pictures are real photos of what i got.  If you are in the LA area, you can check out the batteries.  I believe a few LA people know me.

You can also check all my past posts to see that I am pretty straight up with all my posts.

I think the batteries they make are good, and I have purchased 3 batteries for myself from them and 2 for friends.

Purchased myself:
12s8p
12s4p
10s2p

Friends:
12s4p
10s4p
