If you have a motor that works that has just been sitting around, I wanna buy it! I just need one motor, if you have a pair for a bargain price I will consider buying. I have a cool project in mind but I wanna make the first one without too much of a dent in my wallet. If it works I'll upgrade and give a build guide to the forum! Thanks
