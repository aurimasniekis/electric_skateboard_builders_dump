40T won't fit on 83mm without being super close to the ground. I'd go for 36T on 83mm..

But buildkitboards sells several pulleys

40T fits well on 90mm, that's what I'm using now.
36T fits well on 83mm
I have extra 36T 9mm Flywheel pulleys and 9mm 265 belts too!
I have 2 Torqueboard Aluminum pulley(Used) and a bunch of printed pulleys(Unused).

Here is a video with the printed pulleys:

I actually liked the printed pulleys better.
