I have a set of four still in packet untouched red egg shocks, has anyone got two orange ones they would like to swap for two reds or sell to me????

Feel free to tag those that you think might have such an item... because they are discontinued, so im unable to purchase a set from MBS :frowning:

@Nemesis I might be ordering some red and orange eggs shock blocks very soon since I have some older MBS trucks and a set of Carveboard trucks that have no eggs and a set of Matrix 2's running way too squishy yellow blocks. Where are you located? I could buy an extra set and send it to you at cost plus shipping, or we could swap, if you don't want extras on hand.

Sounds good. Happy to help if I can. Let me know if you get it sorted on your end. It's raining llamas :llama: and unicorns :unicorn: here for the next week or more, so I won't be ordering anything for at least a few days or weeks. Time to work on building my Waterboard for some rain riding. :umbrella:
