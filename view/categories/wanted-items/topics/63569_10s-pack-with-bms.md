looking for a mid sized 10s pack. something at least 10a but no more than 20 I'm thinking. (weight is the main concern in terms of the size). if its a square config, can not be taller than 1.5".   A bms that has a wall adapter is necessary. not looking for any fancy power buttons or screens. I have a Bluetooth module so I can tell how full i am from my phone and a simple anti spark key works just fine. (if you wanna throw this in for free go ahead :)

Just a few final questions before I send u the cash. Is the bms set up for discharge also or does it bypass directly to the esc? Which bms is it? How many cycles are on the battery and bms? What do you use to charge it? Can I just get a wall adapter with the correct amperage and put on bullet connectors and let the bms do it's thing? Is there an xt90 anti spark loop or would I add that in? Thanks.

You need a charger and matching female port with bullet leads, bms is charge and discharge max 60amps, and you can easily setup a loop key to use. I have a charger i can throw in for extra $20 if youd like and i can throw in a female charge port for you with bullets already connected

I think its a bestech, not sure as i didnt build this one so the amount of cycles is also a mystery. It charges to about 96 or 97% for actual voltage, thats why its a discount. Does 12 miles on a 8inch pnuematic scooter so probably 14 or 15 miles on esk8
