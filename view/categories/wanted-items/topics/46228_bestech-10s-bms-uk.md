Has anyone got a spare one sat in a drawer collecting dust?

Build is held up as the one I've got is toast ðŸ˜­

(60A charge and discharge)

Can pick one up new from [here](http://alienpowersystem.com/shop/bms/battery-bms-with-switch-for-10s-lipo-battery/) in the UK, on backorder though but saves the buying two limit in case no one else has anything.

Could also try get one from @DavidBanner at [street-wing](https://street-wing.com/product/10s-battery-management-system/)

But since that is listed as uncategorized he might not be selling them anymore.  Best to ask first.

Yes I tried Luke first, my motor came from him and its brilliant. No joy though, hoping someone has one kicking about they don't need.

Yea unless anyone has any extra to sell, BesTech won't be open again until around end of the month.

Could try hitting up eskating.eu.  They only have custom battery packs listed on the site but using Bestech BMS so might be willing to sell a BMS separately.  
It's run by a forum member too but I can't remember the username unfortunately.

For a whole custom made battery but could still have just the BMS about.

I recently bought the 80A 10s one from this site, they are UK basedtoo. The seller was really nice and shipping to Luxembourg was pretty fast.
Here is the 60a one: [pwrboards.com](https://pwrboards.com/products/bms-60a)

Edit: note that this BMS is speced for Li-ion batteries. So it will work fine with Li-Po batteries for charging too, but the cutoff voltage for discharging is too low.

True, considering the price difference of 7â‚¬ it may be worth it to go with the 80A one instead of the 60A.

I edited my answer to note that it is speced for Li-ion cells.
