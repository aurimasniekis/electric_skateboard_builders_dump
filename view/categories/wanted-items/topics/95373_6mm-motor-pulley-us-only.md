Hey I am new to the eskate community and haven't posted before but am curious to see if any of my US people in here have an extra 6mm bore motor pully they would be able to sell. I can't find any reasonable deals for just the pully itself that will come in a decent time frame. 16T if possible thanks!

You could hammer  in a down sizing bushing from 8 to 6 mm and lock it down with green loctite and then let it cure for at least 24h.
